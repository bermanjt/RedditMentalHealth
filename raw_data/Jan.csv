0,What is more important for mental health? Trying to better the mind itself or better the whole body (nutrition+exercise)?,"1) I know that both are important 
2) I understand it may vary with certain conditions, so I mean more related to depression/anxiety

So what do you guys think? Is it more important to seek therapy to fix certain patterns of thinking? Or perhaps that therapy is useless if our eating isn't right and those ""bad feelings"" will still persist regardless of how much self-love, confidence we bring in, especially now that we know a lot more science with the gut-brain connection? Perhaps those two are also useless if we don't exercise at all, not optimising our good hormones?"
1,Well it's 2021!,"If only new years ment new starts. Imagin if 2021 turned up and took away the problems the same problems I've been suffering with since I can remember. I've always struggled with Christmas and new year but after a couple really shitty months this has to have been the worst new year.

In all honstenly I fucking hate Christmas and new year with a passion there's so much pressure to be happy and optimistic about the new year coming but let alone every year just seems to get worst and worst.

But anyway happy new year, I hope your 2021 brings only good things."
2,How do I stop ruining relationships,"Had a breakdown yesterday, and i’m feeling awful today. It was one of those breakdowns where your mind is just ripping itself apart until you get too overwhelmed and go numb then pass out. I feel like the worst fucking human being alive today. I won’t go into detail about what I feel, but i really fucking dont want to be here anymore. And I have no friends or anyone to talk to. I only have one person who I trust, who likes me enough to care about my feelings sometimes. And I want to talk to her, vent to her or something, but I cant help but feel like im making her hate me because im being dependent or fucking crazy or something. But I have such a strong fucking need to talk to someone that knows me, to have a friend listen to me and feel bad for me or fucking something to make me not feel so fucking awful about myself. Its like the more they pull away the more I collapse and latch onto them until I just ruin our relationship. And the more she pulls away the more I have paranoid thoughts like I think that she doesnt like me anymore, is secretly backstabbing me or using me and doesnt care about me at all. And it keeps going. And im aware that im doing all this and im fucking everything up but that doesnt stop it it just makes me feel like a fucking psycho and even more worthless. 

This is the second time this exact thing has happened. The first time I completely ruined the relationship and I dont want to do it again. Both times, I was in an awful state of mind, and specifically just in a state of tearing my self esteem to shreds and feeling suicidal.Idk what to do. The worst part is just trying to talk about this with them will push them away even further because im just showing how fucked I am. I hate this post, I hate what it shows about me as a person, but I just dont want to lose my friend."
3,"“At some point in your life, you internalized the belief that something was wrong with you.”","My therapist said this to me today. After several misdiagnoses (bipolar, BPD, npd, avpd and even DID), I’m at a loss and I have no idea who I am anymore. I’ve been searching for something to explain my behavior &amp; destructive thought patterns for so long, but so many wrong labels have completely contorted my self-perception. 
 
Has anyone else ever been told this before? It would explain my slight hypochondriac tendencies as well (i.e., being physically ill in one way or another at all times) as well as my inability to pinpoint my emotions. I’m so frustrated. I’m so confused."
4,Please help! I’ve never ever had a friend in my life. Really struggling to socialize. Was bullied all the time. What’s wrong with me?,"I’m 16 yo girl, currently living in Central Asia, I go to high school. I have many problems. 

I’m only child in family. My first 3 years of life I was a normal child. I didn’t have any friend or anything, I spent most of my time playing alone or with my parents. When I turned 4 I went to kindergarten. In the kindergarten, i started developing problems. In the kindergarten, I was always avoided, all children didn’t want to play with me. when I tried to make any contact and play with them, they straight up told me that they don’t like me and they don’t want to be friends with me. I was always alone in kindergarten. In kindergarten children started bullying me and making me fun of me. 

Then I went to elementary school and things started to get worse there. I was very bullied and made fun of. People actively and aggressively bullied me. I was always sad and upset about it. When I told my parents that I’m bullied my mother told me that I should be aggressive to them and do what they do to me. So when they bullied me, I screamed and told them bad words back. I was getting messages and papers in my locker about how stupid horrible ugly I am. I wrote them the same messages back. In 3rd-4th grades students even started beating me. The school administration tried to stop bullying and made me change classes, talk with students but nothing helped. I was bullied in every class and everyone. I visited school Counselor couple times and she told me to react and pay attention to bullying. I stopped reacting and paying attention to bullying then. 

At 5th grade I moved to other country and went to new school. I moved to Belarus. In new school people were interested in me at first because I was foreign and looked different. And people in Belarus weren’t racist or rude at all. I speak Russian fluently and Russian is the main language spoken in Belarus. After couple weeks in new school people started avoid me. I tried to make friends but I failed. There was attempts to bully me like someone drew a dick on my chair and everyone made fun of me for it. But I didn’t react negatively in any way and just didn’t say anything. After passive aggressive bullying started. Like if I ask an eraser or pencil, they wouldn’t give me even I asked them. And I was never invited to birthday parties or when my classmates got together and went to cinema. I visited many extracurricular activities like singing, acting, drawing, language courses, karate, dancing and I couldn’t make friends anywhere. Some time later people started avoiding me and any contact with me. 

In 7th grade I moved back to Kazakhstan and went to new school. It was school for gifted children and was very demanding and difficult. In the new school I tried to be active, tried to become class president. I talked to everyone, asked questions was active. I didn’t become class president, no one even gave me one vote, other two students got many votes. Then I started experiencing things that happened before again. No one sit in class with me, in group projects no one wanted to be in the team with me. I was avoided and disliked by all people. As always, I was ignored when I talked, people told not so good things about me and I’ve had a bad reputation in general. I was blamed for breaking someone’s phone once and even that girl called police and told me that I broke her phone. This school experience was really bad and then I left that school. 

In 10th grade I went to new school. I had a goal. My goal was to make couple friends and be socially active in new environment. I was active as possible, participated in school activities, was kind and nice to everyone, did my best academically. I still was avoided in class. When I tried to sit next to someone, that person would immediately stand up and sit to another place. In school activities like concerts, I was avoided to participate. The only thing they let me to do was decorating the hall. I wanted to participate in group dance but they said they don’t want me to dance and be on the stage. There was girls with whom I wanted to become friends. I asked if We can be friends and they all said no. They said that they don’t know me well enough, that they don’t enjoy spending time with me, that they don’t trust me and so on. 

As you can see all of my attempts to socialize failed. I’ve never had a friend in my life. Even one friend. Or anyone even close to friend. In classroom I always sit alone, in lunch break I always sit alone. Outside, in park I walk alone or with my parents. I never went somewhere with someone else than my parents. And people ask me why I’m alone or with my parents all the time. My parents’ friends, my relatives, my neighbors ask that and I don’t know how to answer. 

The problem with socializing isn’t other people or environment. The problem is me. I changed many schools, was in many activities, lived in different countries. Nothing worked. 

I’m quite introverted person. I want to socialize and have friends too. I feel better when I’m at home and alone, I don’t like big socializing places like parties. That doesn’t mean that I always want to be alone tho. I have couple friends on internet whom I found on reddit. I want to have friends irl too

I was told by other people that I’m very weird and very different. That I act and speak weirdly. It’s quite difficult for me to socialize. I don’t know how to start conversations, what to tell to the person. I don’t know how to keep conversations going. I don’t know what to tell back to the person. I often can’t find words to tell or how to reply. The conversations I have with people are so short and dry. I can never form like an emotional connection with people. When I joke is told I often don’t understand the joke or I’m the last to understand the joke. I was told that my jokes are weird and very unfunny. I’m just so socially awkward all the time. I just don’t fit in anywhere. 

I’m afraid that I’m gonna be alone like that all of my life. I want to have a normal life, have friends, significant other, career, personal interest and hobbies. I have non of these. Well I’m young to have SO and career but not having friends or any hobbies is weird. 

My parents, especially my mother is very emotionally abusive. She doesn’t understand at all, scolds me and screams at me a lot and sometimes for no reason. She tells me really hurtful words. I really hate her and she’s really bad person in general. 

At the moment I’m struggling a lot. Especially with the school. I have problems with studying, focusing, being organized. I think I may have ADD/ADHD tho I’m not sure. I have a post about struggles with studies on my profile. I have quite bad anxiety. I wouldn’t say my anxiety is social. I’m mostly anxious about my health, my future. I’m often anxious for no reason too. Lately I feel really bad, disappointed, guilty. I started really disliking and hating myself lately. 

What’s wrong with me? Why I never had a friend? Do I have autism or something? What should I do? How can I socialize?"
5,Struggling with isolation,"Really struggling tonight. I spent Christmas alone due to restrictions and now I’ve been places in isolation as I’ve been in contact with someone with covid - so news years alone too. 

I feel so lonely. I have friends nearby but they are also in isolation, have just come out or have left the city to go home for Christmas. 

I don’t know when I’m going back to work and Im struggling to see light at the end of the tunnel. Tonight just feels particularly hard. It’s the first time I’ve felt like I don’t want to carry on. I’m not at the point where I’ll do anything to myself but I feel like I’m not far off slipping down the slope. It’s horrible. 

Please tell me I’m not the only one feeling like this."
6,I Wish You A Very Happy And Safe New Year,"Hello all! 

Well... in the UK, it’s officially 2021! (Phew....)

So, because of that, I want to wish every single one of you a very happy, safe and memorable new year. The past year has been a difficult one, for myself and millions of others. But, you know what? We got over the finishing line. Some of you may have crawled past it, but... you made it. It doesn’t matter how you got here, you *made it* and I’m so incredibly proud of you. 

Always remember, dig down deep into your mind... you have accomplished something this year, you have become a better person. Yes, it may hurt a little, but that’s the whole part of the process. The year has gone up and down for me personally, but in the end, I’ve made it. But, this isn’t about me, it’s about **YOU**. Please, tonight, give yourself a tap on the back for overcoming tough days, dark thoughts and emotional breakdowns. 

I am **1 word** - GRATEFUL. I am grateful to be given another chance and another opportunity to show others and myself that I am a changed person. Because in the end, we are all given another chance to follow our dreams, to let bygones be bygones and simply burn the bridges of last year. I am grateful for my family, I couldn’t have asked for better people to be in my life. 

We will open a book. It’s pages are blank. We are going to put words on them ourselves. The book is called *Opportunity* and it’s first chapter is on New Years Day. Start your year off right - I’ll be here for you. 

Have a brilliant night, whatever you have planned. Stay safe, enjoy your time with family + friends (social distancing!!!) and I shall see you next year! 😉

Thank you for reading. :)"
7,The loneliness of adhd/depression and lockdown is starting to get to me. All I do is survive and wish I could have someone to survive with,"Preface: I want to say very clearly I am NOT in any way suicidal. I know this post is a little dark at times, but I can honestly say that suicide is not something that I have ever seriously considered.

Ive denied having mental health issues for quite a long time despite a therapist talking with me about it for years. I'm 27 and I have Dysthymia depression, mild anxiety, some really mild paranoia, and adhd. Ive been fighting against it all my life and the truth is I don't really know what to do. I'm 27 and finished college late but had to move back in with my family. I don't have a job, I try to at least engage with my hobbies on a day to day basis but the truth is even if I enjoy something it just feels like more trouble than its worth. I can't focus on anything even the things I want to.

I just feel empty inside, I feel like I can't express myself even to the few people I know. They just don't understand and I Could never fully lay all of it out there. I wish I could just be WITH someone in my depression.

I generally do a good job of taking care of the important things while depressed. I'll keep good hygiene but I fall apart in other ways. I'll stay up really really late cause I just don't feel like sleeping, I'll take I'll sit in the fetal position in the shower, I'll cry watching porn thinking about how I can't even get a hug cause no one would ever want someone as broken as me.

As I get more depressed it does weird things to my sex drive. I grew up very conservative and so I have lots of bad hangups about sex anyways. Lots of guilt even for masturbation. I'll go a week or 2 without it then binge for hours in one night. I'll be on the verge of tears sometimes as I watch. The cuter the woman the more I want to cry. I want to be accepted. Sometimes I'll try to get to know people online, sometimes I'll try to find a woman to talk to sexually (consensually) but between the depression and my own inexperince its just a mess.

I think what happens is I want to feel a connection with someone. I want to be told I'm not to broken to care about, I want a woman to tell me that she isn't repulsed by me (Even if she probably should be). I crave someone who will just let me be....disgusting with them. Not make me hide my emotions or desires (sexual or not). I wish I could just be like ""this is who I am, I can't get a hug so Im going to masturbate cause at least its not a bad feeling"". I get really emotional about it. I wish I wasn't so hypersexual when I was depressed. I don't know why i can't just... be.

I'm so tired of being a mess. If you actually read all of this thank you for listening.

tl;dr Depression and adhd are ruining my life, sucking the joy out of it, and I don't know how to cope."
8,I've lost hope. Please help so that I can see 2021.,"2020 has been difficult for everybody, but I am afraid to admit that it has been both the best and the worst year of my life personally.

&amp;#x200B;

The best part is that I got a girlfriend.  I always thought I was too ugly to get one, but she loves me.  So that's nice.  I also began testosterone, and it has helped my life in more ways than one.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is that I picked up old habits again. I started hurting myself again this year.  I shattered my hands with a hammer and I have cut myself open at least fifteen times this year.  I have visited [lostallhope.com](https://lostallhope.com) in hopes to study the best way to end my life, and I have gone to 4-Chan many times to try to get just one more person to urge me to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still here, and I don't know if I'm happy about it or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a naturally happy person.  I used to be chill and fine and have a thick skin, but now I find that my life consists of a cycle of my own demise. I harm myself, I try to kill myself, I tell myself I'm sorry, I take care of myself, and then it all crumbles again.  I can't stop hurting myself, it's the only thing that can relieve the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

I have developed a severe eating disorder this year.  I'm terrified of food and eating.  I won't even eat my vitamins.  I feel like subconsciously I hope that I'll just die in my sleep because I'm not eating enough. My bones are beginning to show.  I can feel every single line in my arm and chest and spine. The best thing about this is the extra skin I have from losing over 300 pounds, and it gives the false effect of some sort of stomach.  The bones are starting to show in my face.  My mom and girlfriend are worried, but I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

Social media has been a huge burden to me.  It has only brought me immense pain and suffering.  I can't continue this cycle of hurt.  I can't go on with this.

&amp;#x200B;

While staring into the abyss of a blank ceiling with the faint drone of the calming Suicide Prevention Hotline music, I can't help but wonder what other people's lives would be like without me.  The only thing truly stopping me is the fact that my girlfriend would be distraught, my cat wouldn't know why I never woke up, and I don't want to be another piece of trash for the poor crime scene sanitation people to have to clean up.  I don't want to make someone else have to tear down a mattress and scrub a carpet. Hell, I don't like doing it myself, so I don't want someone else to have to do it for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just a body.  We're all just a body.  That's all.  I don't see personalities or smiles or happy faces anymore.  I don't even see sad faces anymore.  Or angry.  Or anything.  I just see bodies, all living the same routine, doing the exact same thing.  Nobody knows what comes after death.  How do I know I'll meet a God in the sky when I'm gone?  How do I know I won't just disappear forever?  My life will just slip away and be done with, and that's that.  But, if I did carry out a plan and succeeded and there was perhaps a Heaven, I wouldn't make it in.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mean for this to be a ramble.  I don't want for people to worry about me.  Nobody worries about people unless they're pretty or dead, so I don't expect anybody to really care in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to carry out a plan.

&amp;#x200B;

I want help.

&amp;#x200B;

Please."
9,I thought I was gone for a day?,"So, this is strange. My brain isn’t the best thing to deal with. I’ll snap into periods of pure energy and then extreme depression. But my head did something today that isn’t normal. My brain just starts to fuck up, I had random thoughts and feelings and then my body just shut off? I don’t remember anything from being alive. Yesterday just disappeared. It’s the second day now and I’m starting to think again. Wtf? I thought I wasn’t real that whole time. Like I was some sort of spirt. This has happened before. Where my head become muffled and I just do things but this was just me laying emotionless in bed for 48 hours"
10,Just need someone to talk to,Can anybody teach me how to control or not to feel emotions?
11,This is mildly concerning Scratch that this is fucked,"I saw this post 
“What is your most precious childhood memory?”

I have none

I have nothing 

I can’t remember any exciting moments in my life 

Wether that’s from my anxiety/depression I don’t know but I have no good memories 

Only extremely bad, bad, tolerable or I don’t feel anything 

My childhood isn’t over but I’ve been here 13 years I should remember something happy right 

There’s got to be happy moments in my life right 

I don’t understand 

Why can’t I remember anything

I feel like I’m not happy in any of the memories that are coming up 

I’m remembering moments when I’m smiling/laughing but all I remember is feeling uncomfortable or sad in those moments 

What is happening

Holy shit

Help?/Is this normal? 

No it can’t be normal because that post wouldn’t be there if you can’t remember that type of stuff 

Help?"
12,"20 years old. Bipolar #2, ADHD, Iv overcome a lot of shit recently. But with that comes the shit i still struggle to overcome. Im pretty sure im able to do it, but wow is this a hard road to walk.","relied on drugs since i was 12 to feel a sense of completeness. people never treated me the way i treated them. so i tended to fall back on drugs cuz when people leave u in pain drugs always keep u ok. long as u got em. that took 8 years of heavy dependence on every substance -crack to learn tho. got off prescription opioids and benzos like 17ish, to fall back into the old habits when a close friend committed suicide. 4 months later after waking up and sobbing all day long for 1/3 a year i decided to try to heal from the loss by taking acid. ofcourse just before i began to lift myself out of the hole id been in till that point, a girl who i thought saved my life like an angel sent from heaven showed up and completely changed my life forever. at first it was amazing, she rlly wanted me, she reassured all my self doubts, she made me get sober and employed. than the red flags started popping up. she called herself ""pure"" cuz she was a virgin at 16. that didn't hold up as time went on. first shed tell me shed do anything for me, than when shed tell me guys she was friends with would constantly be hitting on her i asked for her to specifically block 2 people i knew were more than just friends but i always let her convince me regardless of her actions that she was loyal and she never fucked around like that so i just let it be. it pops up more n more throughout our relationship, which just kept growing more and more toxic as time went on cuz a year+ into it i learned she had bpd. i started to use drugs again to cope with the pain i was being dealt almost daily. eventually i landed myself in juvenile hall for 5 months. she stayed with me thru all of it, paying $300 a week to answer my every phone call. thats what cemented our relationship cuz how could i leave her after for 5 months all i was told by everyone around me was i was blessed to have a girl so loyal cuz most the kids locked up had to find out by 3rd party they girl had been fucking their friends. so when i came out and she couldn't handle her home life and i let her live with me in my room at my parents. now 18 freshly outta half a year almost locked up i lost my grandfather same week as another close friend, again to suicide. again i fell back into my ways and made the jump from pills to acual heroin and fentanyl. only on them for about a month before my dad made it clear it was either i stayed or i kept doing heroin but i couldn't have both. so i went thru the hell of withdrawal and immediately was forced back into doing something to work towards my future. wasn't even done with the withdrawals before i had to go to college. started attending within the week and remembered how debilitating my adhd was. used that as an excuse to start a new monster of an addiction. first addy, addy plug moved. than to meth for a year. by the end of that year my life was completely destroyed. she (not in any way unreasonably) was unhappy that id shifted all my focus from her to fashion. so she did what bpd tends to make people do and began to toxically pick constant fights, putting me down for almost every day outta that year. and it went from verbal alterations to her physically abusing me. i eventually got sick of her screaming for all my neighbors to hear how much of a loser meth head i was. and i began to try to softly walk her out of the room. it never ended with the intention of deescalating the conflict but she always took it as reason to begin hitting or kicking me. eventually after so many months of emotional terrorism essentially i let the meth and my survival instincts take ahold of me when shed been throwing heavy objects that weren't cheap at me and rlly doing some next level physical abuse, i tried to calmly walk her out. ofc it ended in her straight up throwing hooks at my face and kicking harder than she ever has and eventually she hit me so many times i without consideration at all accidentally threw a punch and my luck it had to perfectly land her face and leave a black eye. she immediately used this opportunity to turn everyone i thought was my real friends against me. than even all my associates. she had my neighbors, old friends and their parents all completely avoiding any sort of interaction with me cuz all they ever heard was her screaming like i stabbed her or something. i lost everything. eventually i got sober off meth cuz i saw the destruction it ravaged in my life and the physical and emotional negative side effects of a year of heavy abuse. it was a long recovery but faster than i expected by far. i was friendless and put all i had into her because shed taken everything that wasn't her away from me. than she killed herself on my bed after already traumatizing me during another trip to recover. i came into my room and lived thru all the stages of grief within 5 seconds, forced the tripping part of my brain to switch off and did what needed to be done. i gave her cpr and mouth to mouth and eventually and more desperate than iv ever done anything in my life i got her to gasp for air and made sure she threw up the 10 bars and hennessey she took. cleaned fed and nursed her back to health. next day she was good as before. than she did the thing that brought me to where we at today. she posted on her IG story a business associate with heart emojis and a pregnant emoji. she'd already traumatized me beyond belief, took all my friends away, and now she wanted to ruin what little i had left and i was over it. i broke up with her and blocked her. i tripped 3-5 days later at a not friends house i thought was a decent person but just used me as a way to get at my ex while i cried to him about her and the shit she put me thru. She blows up my phone making it 10x worse. It took a few days but after taking to an old friend, actually my 1st friend who took his own life, his ex. i thought it was fair to let her say what she needed to get closure and i would as well. so we did. the way she ended it she roped me back in tho ofcourse. so i was all happy thinking ok so we gonna take time n put in work on ourselves than try again n hopefully shell be the person shed made me believe i loved for 3 years. but less than a week later i caught her hacking my ig accounts, texted her that wasn't cool to which she blew up and crushed my heart. she told me she moved on and had a new man. literally like 2 weeks after our 3 year relationship. i honestly thought she was just trying to hurt me but few more days later i found out she's actually dating that friend i mentioned in the beginning. she continued to get at my old business associate. and she unblocked and casually started talking to my abuser (ill let u assume the extent of the abuse) and befriended him like she never expressed multiple times she wanted to kill him herself. plus shes selling shit she stole from my house on her story. never thought anything would top being cheated on but this made being cheated on look laughable. its the nexr day after learning this information and im still in great amounts of pain. but i know all this suffering isn't without life lessons and self growth. im slowly beginning to focus on myself and not look outward for any sense of relief cuz i know what it will end with. so now im not relying on drugs anymore or people. just myself. its not easy but im not gonna put the pain i went thru losing 2 friends to suicide on my family. day by day i guess."
13,Anyone else?,Christmas just felt underwhelming and void of joy and excitement for me my emotions are that gone that Christmas just didnt feel special to me anyone else the same
14,I hit a fake weed cartridge and now i feel like im going insane,"This happened about 3 weeks ago. I hit the cartridge and then i full-on had a trip. For the first two and a half weeks, everything was alright. Now, i feel like everything is fake, and like something between my brain and my body is cut off. I also feel just uncomfortable and off and i feel so bad. What is wrong with me."
15,My friend (M16) said he doesn’t feel and wants to end himself sometime after his 17th.,"It’s as the title says, he said he hasn’t felt since grade 3. He said he doesn’t want to tell his parents but I feel like he won’t get any help unless he does. What do I do I’m with 2 others on this like what do we do. Do we get him diagnosed, do we get him a session with a therapist? Should we show him the quality of life? Like where do we go with this. He means a lot to me and I’d like him to be in my life going forward."
16,My wife started a mental health support channel because I was feeling down.,"TLDR, I've been feeling a bit down for the past 6 months from the pandemic cause I'm a software developer and I stay holed up in my house for most of my days. I know the vaccine is coming soon, but it's finally hitting me even though I'm fairly introverted - so my wife decided to start a youtube channel to teach me and others how to care and love ourselves more. 

I think one thing we ought to do more in our lives especially is to reflect and write down the things that make us happy and motivated, goal planning etc - in order to find a trajectory and an aim point of where to go from here. 

Anyways, I thought I could do my part as a husband to share the amazing work she's done so far, and inspire others who are feeling the same way. 

I've dropped a link below to her channel, admins let me know if this is OK!

17,Deprived of personality,"I just feel [insert title here].
I don't have ANY fashion (meaning how to coth half decently) sense, particular taste in music, hobbies that I really practice.

It's not that I don't have things that I'm interested in, I do! But ever since that's the thing I'm supposed to be doing/studying; I'm robbed of my enthusiasm to do it. To the point that I'm doing only the absolute bare minimum I have to do not to be kicked out. (I probably have done more research on suicide than the actual thing I'm supposed to study - and not because I picked the wrong field or anything)

I just feel like an empty shell of a person.
I kind of only want to end it now, but I'm too much of a coward to even do that."
18,Do people who you can contact such as Samaritans judge you?,I’ve kept my mental health problems to myself for 2 years and I have decided that I might talk to Samaritans but I am undecided on whether I should or not because I’m unsure on whether I’ll be judged or even taken serious because I’m young so if anyone could tell me if they would judge me or not then that’d be much appreciated.
19,"Hey guys,","
First post I’ve ever made in Reddit but having a hard fucking time right now. Have a great family to spend New Years with but have had to plenty to drink and have nevertheless really spoken to anyone about my mental health difficulties. I’m a 25Y Male and I feel like I’ve ducked everything up. Have a few low grade A levels in my life and some minor selling experience as a BDM but it defo now my call in life and currently unemployed:

My head was a everywhere and feeling like panic all the time. Tonight was amazing I was really close with family and my brother in law but feeling like I’m on the verge of a full on breakdown. Don’t know how to fix things as a teenager I was looking looking like an Oxford/Cambridge kind of kid but am now 25yo living in. My mums house and don’t know what to. Do with myself. 

I’m feeling so shit here while I’m so high in emotional tension I spot know what to say I’m sorry this may be hard to comment anything supportive on"
20,Happy new year gang 💖,"It’s a been a tough year for me and I’m sure for many of you. I just wanted to say happy new year to you all and I’m thinking of you! Thank you for getting me through the year with comments of support and kindness, for being there for me when I felt alone and mostly importantly for being you 🥰"
21,Started 2021 off right... yeah nah,"Happy new year guys! Hope you’re all doing as well as you can! 

When the clock hit 12 I felt nothing. It was weird but it happens. Within 2 hours of the new year hitting my time zone, I was crying. Great way to start the year right? 

I don’t know if it was a good cry or a bad one if I’m honest. I was bunking with a friend for the night, and while we were talking I ended up admitting how much I’ve been struggling the last 3 weeks. How I’ve thought about giving myself alcohol poisoning just to feel something other than empty. I cried into her shoulder for a good 20 minutes. 

I feel terrible about it - that’s heavy shit to tell someone, especially at 2am. She doesn’t have any experience with mental health issues and did her best to calm me down which I love her for. I really am grateful that I have amazing people around me, but I hate burdening them with my problems. I regularly feel like I’m making it up for sympathy, and I hate being treated different for it. I hate myself for telling her just how bad I’ve been, especially since I’ve been out on anti-depressants and should be feeling normal. 

I know I need to go to someone about this so I stop hurting the people I care about, but being a uni student money is tight and I can’t afford the kind of therapy I think I need. I’ve talked with doctors and counsellors, and when their advice and solutions work for a couple weeks I get dismissed from their “this person is a danger to themselves” list. And then a month later I’ll relapse. I hate myself for it. This should be working! I’m doing everything, maybe I’m not trying hard enough. I don’t know anymore.

Even though I started this year off on possibly the wrong foot, I’ve promised myself I’m going to figure out a way to get better. For the sake of my friends and family. 

Again happy new year, sorry for the rant, and thank you for being here to make the world a little better with your presence ❤️"

23,Depression comes and goes,"Hello,

 Just wanted to see if a post might make me feel better. But basically I am at the bottom of one of my many depressive episodes right now. I can't get up and leave the shower. I haven't had a proper meal for days because I just don't have the energy( prob cause I haven't eaten) but I eat just fine like a normal functioning human when I'm not depressed. I slept all day. But anyways I've been searching and haven't found much anyone else has like a depression where youre good for a while u got it together then out of no where nothing specific hads happened u just loose it. And everything goes to shut. My boyfriend thinks I'm just selfish and spoiled but he doesn't seem to get it. When I'm good I'm good and when I'm not well I'm just not."
24,How am I supposed to move on from my self-harm habits?,"I know that it’s not healthy, I’m fully aware of that, but I’ve been self-harming in one way or another for the past 10 years.

When I was at my worst it was constant and obsessive cutting my thighs. And even in between those ‘relapses’ I’m scratching at my ankles and wrist until they bleed. And even when I think I’m not doing too bad I still feel like I need that pain in some way so I end up hitting myself til I bruise. 

I’m not sure whether it’s addiction or what but I know that even though I’m the only one it’s affecting (because know one else knows) and I’m not doing permanent damage, that it’s still not healthy but at this point I just don’t know how to stop it. 

So, what I’m asking is, help, how do I stop? What do I do?"
25,How good are antidepressants?,"Just curious. I’ve felt shit for years and I need that lift.

Do they work? What’s it like?"
26,https://youthrider.com/how-to-control-anger-to-live-calm-and-normal-life/," Anger basically triggers the fight response. Usually, it leads to a sudden increase in heart rate, stress, and blood pressure. In addition to this, the breathing rate will increase.  If you fail to manage anger, it affects the metabolism rate of your body and inevitably affects your health and quality of your life.

27,I’m really struggling,"Ok so tonight is the first night where u have really truely struggled.  Firstly,the girl that I like is most likely going abroad which’s spells the end of any relationship we have had. This girl and I have been getting along really well and to be honest this is the first girl I felt a real connection to. After an extremely tough year as many people have had this news has had a deep impact on me. Due to concerns about people in my personal life knowing about this account I will be deleting this tomorrow morning. Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you and have a blessed 2021."
28,Is it ethical for a psychiatrist to refuse medication refills without warning for mental illness??,"So I’m just a little curious about something here. Those of you who see a psychiatrist, wondering if they ever refused to refill a medication until your next appointment? I do not think this is ethical to stop a mental health patient’s medication with no warning, but im curious as to if im wrong and this is a common occurrence? 

I missed my appointment with my psychiatrist in October, and promptly rescheduled but the inly thing available was in late November. This is a common occurrence when I’m scheduling appointments, she is always booked up for a lengthy time. This is extra hard bc I work in a Ford assembly plant and i work 12 hour days, commute 2 hours total there/back, and leave for work at a quarter to 5pm and get home at 6:30 am. So i can’t exactly go to the Dr on work days bc I’m sleeping. 

Anyway, my appointment for November was virtual... i woke up during my sleep for the visit since it was all i could get and they didnt send me the link for the virtual visit. I called the nurse to send me the link and signed in. My appointment was for 2pm. I logged in at 2:02pm.  I waited there in the “waiting” room for 45 mins, which was well past my 20 min appt. I finally sent a message on the chat section for the virtual visit and messaged my Dr saying “hey, its____ just wondering if our appt is canceled for some reason or if you’re running late?” .... I sat there for another 20-30 mins waiting before I finally logged off and went back to sleep. 

At the time of that appointment it was already a week late to fill my panic/anxiety meds (klonopin). Even though i dont need them every day i need to take 1-2 more than prescribed to help my anxiety when i take it so i usually run out a week or so before my script is up, so i had been without for 2+ weeks. 

The day after my virtual non appointment i called to reschedule and talk to the nurse bc i had already sent a medication refill request twice with the medical app and once through the pharmacy and still nothing. So i spoke to the nurse to schedule an appt and she said my psychiatrist would not fill that medication  until i see her again. I explained what happened during the virtual visit and she said there was nothing she could do. Also, I couldnt get an appt with her again until late January bc my psych wasnt going to be working for all of December...

So i asked the nurse, is it even ethical or acceptable for a psychiatrist to just not fill your medication at zero warning whatsoever. ESPECIALLY when it’s a medication that helps with panic attacks and your overall mental wellbeing as someone with a mental illness that can be dangerous. 

THEN, i spoke to a friend of mine that sees the same psychiatrist and has the same mental illness... and she said that our psych also would not refill her mood stabilizer til she saw her for an appt as well. 

Now i still have some of my mood stabilizer as well as my other two medications, but I’m gonna run out of those as well before i see her again... so is my psychiatrist going to pause those medications as well? Bc if so that is completely messed up and totally unethical in my opinion. 



TL;DR: My psychiatrist will not refill my medication that i ran out of in November til i see her in late January. Same psychiatrist will also not refill some of my friends medication as well til she sees her. Psychiatrist is currently not refilling my panic attack/anxiety meds (klonopin/Benzos) as well as my friends mood stabilizer. I’m worried when my mood stabilizers/other 3 medications run out a week or two before my next appointment she will also not refill those. 

????? IS THIS ETHICAL??? IS THIS NORMAL??? SHOULD I FIND A NEW PSYCHIATRIST???"
29,Does therapy really work?,"I don’t really have the room or energy to give you the whole spiel but here’s an abridged version.

I’ve had some form of depression for around five years. I think I’ve had social anxiety since I was like ten years old and I’ve had generalized anxiety disorder...maybe as long as I’ve had depression but I’m the last two years or so it’s become a lot lot worse.

I just had an anxiety attack bc of Covid (might have it and started convincing myself I have symptoms) and I’m honestly just fed up.

I feel like I have imposter syndrome with these illnesses but I honestly don’t know what else they could be. I’ve been wanting to try therapy, but I’m scared for some reason that I’m lying to myself or that I would lie to my therapist and be falsely diagnosed or something. Or that if I started it that it wouldn’t help and I’d basically have one other option for treatment in meds.

I’m terrified of exhausting that option which is why I’ve never tried it before. But it’s just getting worse and worse. I don’t know what else to do and I’m tired of living like this. This anxiety attack has left me weak and exhausted (or maybe the covid is kicking in or smthn) and I just can’t deal.

Does therapy work? Please, any advice would help."
30,Looking for an app that limits time on other apps,"I constantly find myself dragged into meme apps and reddit for way too long each day, it's frustrating and addictive. I'm looking for an app that I can set a certain amount of time each day, for individual apps. The only ones I've found just lock down my whole phone for set time periods. I wanna be able to, for instance, set iFunny so I can only use it 30 minutes a day, so that I only scroll through if I'm on the shitter or on the bus, not when I could be doing something productive. I'll take whatever works, it can be a parental control app or something, even if I have to download it on another phone to be the ""parent phone"". Thanks in advance!"
31,How do you forgive someone and move on if you don't exactly have closure?,"My dad cheated on my mum. Not just once, it was an ongoing thing. I was there to see how much it hurt her, how it broke her, and that it will proably never go completely away. It will never be entirely okay.

This happened some years ago. They worked on it and they're still together, they still love each other. I'm an adult myself (albeit young and still living with them), and I should probably be okay. But I'm not. I'm not over it. I don't think I've ever quite forgiven him, especially when he literally acts like nothing ever happened, like he never did anything (even makes jokes that I would never dare to make in his position), and it pisses me off so much.

I want to love my dad. I do love him, and I want to forgive him and move on. He is a good dad. I don't want to keep holding it against him, it's exhausting. But how do I do that...? He knows I know everything, but he never even acknowledged it. We never talked about it with me. Like, is it selfish to feel fucking betrayed too?? I mean, it wasn't just mum he hurt... Ever since we were kids, he always taught us to be honest and truthful and all that crap... he's seen (and I suspect he sees himself) as the most selfless person ever... and then he pulls crap like that?? It turned everything into a load of lies and him into a giant hypocrite. And he never even acknowledged it. 

And worst of all, I don't think he even fully realizes this, that he's aware of the (lasting) damage he's caused. Recently I asked my mum if they ever went to couples' therapy about this, and she said no because he wasn't willing to. Allegedly, he said that HE doesn't need therapy, HE's okay and HE has it all sorted out. I mean - COME ON!!! And he goes happily to church every Sunday - what a fucking hypocrite!!!

Shit... I don't want to be angry anymore... I want to love him and be okay. But I still kind of resent him, no matter how hard I try to let it go. There's a chasm between us that I don't know how to bridge (don't know if I want to, on some level...). What do I do...? I feel like the issue might be the fact that he never addressed it, we never got to talk about it, so I never got closure (or a chance to forgive since I never saw any remorse from him). But I don't think I can just bring it up out of the blue. I don't even know if it's fair to open old wounds like that. And knowing him, he won't bring it up with me...

I'm just... so fucking disappointed with him, and hurt and betrayed, and probably still angry on mum's behalf. Idk what to do about all these feelings. (Probably just need therapy, right..)

Sorry this got so long.. Happy New Year, everyone. Take care of yourselves, sending my love. Hope it's a better one than 2020 was."
32,I can't get out of my depression,How do I stop this... Like jeezus I feel like shit every time I see people hanging out cause I can't achieve the same. Everytime I get more open I just get shoved away. If I have a problem with my mental health I just get ignored. Everytime I've talked about this it has gotten worse and people started to detest me when they heard I had depression. Is this something that I don't have any control over why do people just don't like me the way I am. I try pretty hard to better myself but I just get hurt again. I just want to know that this isn't permanent right?
33,Remorse or interest?,"I’m currently 14 years old and I find myself not able to find remorse or interest, Or just not amused. I do have a sense of humor and can actually have fun but it’s take a lot to get to that feeling? And with remorse I sometimes don’t feel bad? Unless it’s really really sad, is this normal or should I be worried for a disorder?"
34,Its just so much,"Earlier this month my grandmother passed from organ failure due to a multitude of health issues, my girlfriend of close to a year left me the day after Christmas and my cat is going to die any day now.




 2020 started so good and I was so happy, then covid happened, I dealt with that just fine and just this last month so much has happened and I just dont know how to deal with it anymore. It's too much."
35,Always have been jealous of her," I’ve never actually said this out loud, or ever even really addressed this because these thoughts have always kinda been there but i finally wanna talk about it. I was a little girl living in america with my mom and dad. We were quite poor compared to the Americans we’re used to seeing yknow living in big houses with pools and stuff, but we weren’t so poor to the point where we were hungry (just lived in an ugly apartment and constantly collecting coupons p). Anyways, obviously these weren’t things that i had to deal with since i was a child, but i knew we were poor since i could never get anything i wanted when all of my friends were constantly getting piles of toys. I had this one friend and her family isn’t even that rich, but she could get EVERYTHING she wanted. I loved how they just bought stuff without giving an f and i was always extremely jealous. In fact when i look back i notice how much of a loser i became from all of the jealousy, poor 9 year old me would sit down and write lists of things that she had and i didn’t. I’d write down how she was living a better life than me so things like “she has a tv in her room i don’t, she has a wii i don’t, she has a pool i don’t, she has this toy and that toy and blah blah blahh”, and honestly when i look back i just feel so bad for myself. i can’t even be mad at myself because i was a child but honestly, what a loser. 

 Still to this day the jealousy follows me... I now don’t live in america. I live in a much smaller country and a city I absolutely HATE, but my family still is in contact with her family so i hear from her every now and then. I heard last week how she has a car and is traveling to her rich friends house for vacation, and wow when i heard that i just can’t even explain to you how shitty i felt. She also has time for extracurriculars (just like every other american) so she’s a volleyball player and her mom kept talking about how much she loves it. First of all I‘ve been begging for a piano for a whole year straight and can’t get that yet she has a car? Second, i don’t even have to to do anything other than university which sucks ass. I also heard how she got in to college and has only 4 classes, and i have 8 classes and im pretty sure im depressed right now because of them bc i absolutely can not handle it. What am i doing wrong?? I’m literally fucking 18 and STILL TO THIS DAY I AM JEALOUS OF HER?? WTF IS WRONG WITH MEEEEEEEE"
36,Should I discuss this with my therapist??,"Ok, so bear with me! I’ll try to explain as best I can! 

I’m (32F) currently in therapy for MDD, attachment trauma, and anxiety. I have major mommy issues lol. 

I struggle immensely with being vulnerable, especially in person. So when I started therapy with my current T, I used emails and blogs a lot to be able to express myself. I still do. 

Anyway, when I started therapy 6 months ago, my T’s email address was public. Recently though, she gave me a new email address and said this email is more secure and would only be used for private client interaction. She also mentioned that she’s creating a website. 

SO.... now I’ve noticed that her old email address is no longer visible anywhere online, nor is her new one. I’m worried that my attachment issues and neediness is the cause of her removing her email address from the public. Like this is her way to try prevent another person like me from utilizing her email.... 

I know I’m struggling with transference and we’ve discussed this. I’m trying very hard to not overstep boundaries but I also recognize that I need more reassurance, validation, and positive praise than maybe most clients. I don’t know if this fear is just me overthinking or if my T actually sees me as a burden and doesn’t want another client to have her email address... :(("
37,How does one overcome thoughts/feelings of:,"- Being ""watched"" or ""connected"", in a way that those in your life have an eye on you even when they aren't in close proximity physically.

- Reality not being ""real"", like others not actually existing but rather a construct of either a third party or myself.

- Coincidences not being ""coincidences"", in that there is always some connection where the odds are impossibly slim (if only coincidences were winning lottery tickets).

They pop up from time to time, sometimes for a brief moment and sometimes can get me thinking for an hour until I get anxiety and have to distract myself by thinking elsewhere."
38,is it just me or does new years suck?,so hey as of recently I have been having a sort of self-esteem issue of sorts and I have recently noticed that new years is literally the worst it is just a reminder to me of how much a pathetic person I have been this previous year am I the only one who feels this way on new years?
39,"When someone talks about their high libido, I get really insecure and jealous and it takes over my thoughts.","I have a low libido and I am not happy with that and I also want to masturbate but I can't do that. I just want the ability to have a quick hit of the best feeling known to man and a high frequency to have urges to do it but alas, the urges to masturbate never happen and if I do get aroused, it's very little. When people talk about their high libido in any context, I feel like they're giving me a middle finger."

41,Managed breakdown in better way,"Idk if anyone ever has this when you're going through a mental breakdown (not even sure if I'm using the right term because mine last like a month and build, peak/go through phases...idk what else to call it) but there's a phase of just rage and adrenaline. Like I want to go out and overthrow the government and destroy all the people who make life SHIT.. but either way.. normally this rage I get out drinking, partying, driving like 100mph on backroads, doing just self destructive activities, etc... but I've channeled it into rage cleaning this time... and I'm proud of myself... now just fighting off what I think is dissociation because that happens after rage and that's where I get depressed to the point of having suicidal thoughts (I'm not going to do anything though don't worry... I have a very important reason that will keep me from ever doing that..) but just wanted to share cause I did a good thing and I want to share it but don't really have anyone I can share these things with"
42,How do I stop self doubt and negative thinking?,"For years I have struggled with major self doubt and it has really taken a toll on my confidence and self image. I have known this for awhile now, but the perfect analogy dawned on me the other night when I was trying to sleep. I have a nightstand that I made in class last year right next to my bed, and both of my parents are super proud of it and think it is the coolest thing ever. However, when I look at it I can only see where I messed up and all the mistakes I made. This is how I view myself, and have viewed myself for a long time. How can I escape this line of thinking? I don’t want to become an arrogant, overconfident jerk, but I also don’t want to be like this the rest of my life. Any advice? I have watched and read lots of online videos and articles about how to stop thinking like this, but they only work temporarily and then I fall back into the same old routine. Any help is greatly appreciated."

I feel like theres this pressure that you have to do something big or else the year was just useless. Honestly whoever is reading this just calm down because genuinely fuck new years , tomorrows just Friday so have a good Friday everyone ❤️"
44,I think im having intrusive thoughts but im not sure if that what they are,"As the title says i think im having intrusive thoughts like some times i can be lying in bed on my phone then all the sudden im all worried because i got a random ass thought of some one i love dying right now. Or if my mom or dad leaves in the car i might be fine for awhile before i get random pics of car crashes and them dead in my head or it happens right after they leave or it might not happen at all. I get thoughts like these a lot and most of the time there completely random and i didn't see or hear anything that could trigger them. And its the same thing with my pets some one killing them or something bad happening. One that i got not to long ago that made me hurt pretty bad was me and my sister and my nephew were driving in her car and them all of the sudden i get the thought of the car crashing and liam (my nephew) dying and my sister sobbing her eyes out. I don't like having these thoughts they give me really bad panic attacks and them i worry about the people in them for a pretty long time after words before i just get the thought, but this is all im say for now because im really panicking from thinking of these things while typing. So if it is intrusive thoughts pls tell me in the comment area and if its not pls tell me what if could be."

48,i can't seem to feel anything and i fear that it will ruin my relationships with friends and acquaintances.,"i honestly don't know where to start, i just wanted some advice since i have a friend that's constantly texting me to make sure i'm okay. i've been going through some personal stuff, so i stayed away from social media and talked to no one else but my significant other.

this friend has been texting me non-stop, saying things like ""i hope you're okay,"" ""i'll be here,"" and although it's sweet, i honestly don't know how to respond. we've been there for each other a lot before but now i have no idea why i can't feel glad or thankful that he's supporting him.

my other friends on the other hand, have been greeting me since it's 2021 and all that. i don't know what to feel. i haven't responded to anyone because i feel like i'll come off as an insensitive jackass. i've had the same problem with my SO for the past few years about ""disregarding his feelings"" and i swear i would have never known if he never told me. it worries me that this will happen with my friends unless i figure out what to say to them."

51,New year’s resolution,"I like being extra nice to other people because it makes me feel like a better person but I feel like nothing I say has any emotion anymore, I used to be able to write paragraphs on my actual thoughts and emotions but I can’t do that anymore, it makes me feel like a better  person for a few seconds but at the same time I’m just kinda empty lmao am I really a good person if I can’t feel empathy for other people, wanting to care and actually caring are two different things and I try to be affectionate but I can’t feel anything there. moving on is just kinda a numbing feeling, I feel Like I did too much. Having to move on from the one person that you had the ability to love. Well it’s not all that bad, sure there’s no excitement anymore and things are kinda dreary and stingy sometimes, but it takes Time and I feel like I’ve been through the worst part of it. But honestly love is dead, dead asf wish I knew what it felt like again but that’s not the point because it doesn’t  matter how much effort you put in, if things don’t go your way, they don’t, and they never go my way but it’s totally fine mf 💯 I could’ve sworn that it was special, but maybe it’s my mental illness that makes me believe that, there’s tons of coincidental miraculous stuff that TO THIS DAY I cannot explain but if it’s meant to happen, it should’ve and it just didn’t, it doesn’t matter if I’m the one who messed it up which I most likely was but it’s too late now... I have more friends than I did last year and I’m still kinda empty and lonely but maybe it’ll get better, maybe I won’t be depressed anymore and I’ll fix my bad food habits, maybe I’ll feel again next year :) I feel like a whole new person, and I am, I’m way different than last year, the difference being That I wasn’t as miserable last year 😁 ) I think hands down writing This down to cope and cheering myself up whenever I thought of something that I’ve been swallowing down my throat not to think about was the 2nd most pathetic thing I’ve done this year tbh, cant wait for 2021 to be worse, if I die, tell everyone that I was such a positive person who strives for self love 🥳🥳"
52,New Years depression ig,"Hey I’m new to all of this, just figured if I’m feeling this way maybe somebody out there might be too. So I’ll start off by saying I’m not clinically diagnosed because my parents are immigrants that believe mental health isn’t real and everything can be controlled. I hoped the same when I was younger round 11 but I’m 19 now and every year kinda jus feels closer to death. I wrote a little something call it what you will but it’s just thoughts on tonight. 
Happy New Years-
The party is ongoing yet I’m disconnected. 
All the same under a different hue, I want change but I don’t sense nothing new. 
I want happiness but Ik it’s an ongoing struggle, 
I want mo hugs n kisses but Ik I’ll just shrug them off. 
Should I feel this way? Is there somn wrong. When I see everybody breaking in song and I’m feelin alone. A mental thing clearly but idk. Feeling disconnected from what we call this world. I want to be a dreamer but the cloud always follows, numbness all over making my thoughts hard to follow. Good ones leave as fast as they come. Transitory in this river of life that runs. Constantly switching the two emotions, or atleast I hope. 
- I didn’t know how to finish and i guess I only put it on here jus to see if people maybe have something to say to help or if they can relate. I know I should feel grateful about what I have but it’s just like there’s a force field around me and my emotions are frozen. I already meditated and feel slightly better but just numb overall. Psa this is also my first New Years sober 😅.  Sorry for ranting this much and if you got through this thank you and I hope you all have an amazing year."
53,Please help. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.," Happy 2021. I decided to do a new year new me thing and I texted most of my active ""friends"" until I got to this girl. Let's call her T. She's been my best friend since nearly 3rd grade. We haven't talked in 5 weeks because of a fight we had about politics. (Stupid, right?) So I messaged her saying I was sorry about 6 weeks ago no reply. I snapchatted her (which makes it so you can see if they leave you on open) and saw she read it, yet nor reply for the past 5 weeks.

Today I decided to text her. She replied. ""Happy New Years"" I told her I was sorry again and all that, and she said ""It's not about politics, it's always about ME being the bad guy. Never you, just me."" She always would tell me this in fights. You see, I'm not a type to usually do that.. at least I think. I look back now and I'm a fucking asshole.

I just noticed that. Then she said, ""Our friendship might've seemed perfect, but it never was. It'd be okay to stay friends but not best friends"" My heart dropped. You don't get it. I know she's also done many wrong to me, but this time I just listened. I softly just responded with ""i understand.""

What's wrong with me. I don't have any friends. I'm alone. My only true friend is in North Carolina. I'm all the way in Florida.

Now that I've moved school like all of my friends, they've dropped me. Though they text me, I know I'll never be on the top of their list. I don't want to be in existence anymore. They don't realize how FUCKING hard it is to be that perfect friend. Which I'm not. I never was. I didn't reply to my phone. I never answered my calls. They found it me ignoring them. I simply just DON'T want to talk most times. But now I'm realizing how much I should value that time. I have 1 best friend. That's all. My other best friend (T) always told me how she was going to drop her so called fake friends. I never EVER thought I was on that list.

I've been shut out because of my stupidity, now having to pretend to be fine, as I message my online friends crying behind the screen. Now I have no one, except a pillow for me to hug, that's a bonus. I guess. Somebody please tell me what I'm doing wrong.

\*\*PS: I do online school. I cannot make friends. We have strict rules to not chat or do anything like that. I can't go for walks around my neighborhood trying to find friends due to my lack of motivation to do anything. What a perfect start to 2021 for me.\*\*"
54,Thoughts about my existence making me feel scared and sad,"I’m 16 years old and over the past week, I will randomly think of how I exist and and then I get this weird feeling and almost become “detached” from reality. When I’m in this feeling of being “detached” from reality I have these almost impossible thoughts on how anything exists and when I snap out of it I feel depressed and sad. When I am Spending time with family or watching television (distractions), I typically don’t have these thoughts but I still do sometimes. I always think about it when I’m alone and I just want it to stop. No drastic events have occurred recently to make me have these thoughts which just brings all the more confusion. Any help is appreciated."
55,Msg me if you need someone tonight.,"I am depressed with ADHD and anxiety along with other issues who even knows what they are. 

If you're here tonight and wanna talk let me know. I could use some company too. Msg me and we can chat or if you prefer we can talk on discord. Just reach out if you need someone. I'm here."
56,Is this normal ?,"So basically, I don’t know if the things I do are normal or not but it doesn’t seem normal n beginning to think my mental state isn’t the best 
Basically, when I like someone or is real close with someone I want to be with them all the time n they’re my reason for existing everything is about them all I do is think about them and they change my mood like if they’re mad at me I will be sad for a day or two because they are mad etc.
I am the type of person to sleep in my moms room when she isn’t home
I have many mood swings in one day and when I’m fine I feel like I’m seeking for attention
If someone does something I get upset n start blaming myself 
“They wouldn’t do that to me if I was someone else “
Thoughts like that happen 
N if someone I’m close to doesn’t talk to me I feel like my life is meaningless 
Sometimes I go on auto mode n feel nothing n just do what I have to do as time passes nothing even feels real
I do think things
Like “maybe if I don’t text them tonight they will think I’m dead n will text me to see if I’m
Ok” 
So yea I’ve been doing things since I was a kid
And idek what to call what I do ?"
57,Is there anything psychologically significant about reoccurring dreams?,"A few months ago, I started having this reoccurring dream about an extra bedroom in my living space. It's not every single night and I can't seem to correlate it anything like with having a stressful day prior to having a dream like this. Sometimes in this dream, I'm in my actual apartment, but there's an extra bedroom in it. Sometimes it's my apartment but the layout is different. Sometimes it's my mom's house or a friend's house. Sometimes it's a house I made up in my imagination. Sometimes in these dreams, I'll leave the house that I know is my house regardless of what it looks like and go somewhere else and the dream goes in a different direction. But every single instance where I'm in a house that's supposed to be mine in these dreams, there's a bedroom and this bedroom is always upsetting to me. It's not supposed to be there, it doesn't belong. It causes me anxiety in the dream. Inside the room, it's dusty and decrepit and grayed out and there's stuff everywhere. Some of the stuff in the room is mine and I've been looking for it. Sometimes I'm asked about the room, by a parent or a landlord or my husband or a friend. 

The last time I had this dream was a few days ago and I was in my apartment the way it looks in real life (I live in a basement apartment), but when I opened my front door, there were concrete stairs going down to what looked like a real basement and at the bottom of the stairs there were two doors and they both lead to this extra bedroom, and I couldn't find my way out of my apartment.

Sometimes when I'm awake and I know I'm in real life, I'll forget that this room isn't real and I'll think about it like I could get up and find it somewhere even though I don't have a set never-changing location for it. It kind of worries me because I wonder if I'm starting to have trouble with remembering what's real and what's not. I've been struggling with PTSD kinda hard lately and I'm trying not to be a hypochondriac and blame this on that but that's a thing i've been trying not to think about lately. i don't really have a google reason to, it just *feels* like it would be a PTSD thing i guess? 

I have an appointment with my therapist on the 5th and I'm a little anxious about how to talk to her about this but I still plan to one way or another. I'm not looking for like a diagnosis or anything but like is this going to be one of those things where ""oh no reoccurring dreams have just about the same meaning as regular non-obviously translatable random dreams"" and i'm just getting irpy about nothing, or is it actually worth talking about with my therapist?

thanks guys and happy new year 🎊"
58,"I know my husband loves me, but I can’t feel it back.","

59,Heart Palpitations,"Hey guys,  


  
Does anyone here get continuous Heart Palpitations? Even despite doing numerous Heart Tests which came back normal, my Doctor told me it's Anxiety which I found hard to believe.  


It's been over a year now and they still continue to happen (other Anxiety related symptoms have disappeared / lessened). I've completely been stress-free ever since my Doctor told me to calm down, etc, and just mad at the fact that they still happening.  


I've tried supplementing with Magnesium which sort of helped but not to the point which would make them stop completely.  


Does anyone have any tips on how to handle this? I'm about to burnout soon; I can't take this any longer LITERALLY! From morning to night (it's even worse at night when I lie down).  


thank you :/"
60,How can I ask for help without directly asking,I really want to ask for help with depression so bad but I can’t bring myself to do it. I feel like no one would ever understand the way I feel constantly. Is there anyway I could ask for help without having to directly ask. I just don’t wanna be a burden on someone who doesn’t really give a rats.
61,I have no friends,"I (18F) have a cruel reminder tonight being NYE that I do not have friends to hang out with. Granted during the pandemic it is probably for the best, but I still feel like a loser. My boyfriend is basically one of my only friends, and only person I have hung out with who is my age for about a year now. I go on discord and talk to our friends who are mostly his friends, so if we broke up I would be absolutely alone. My best friend lives across the country. I cannot help but feel so alone. I think of college was open maybe I would have made friends, but I have a feeling that I am problem. I do not know what to do besides sit in myself, in my room, by myself waiting for my boyfriend to call me. I do not mean to be a downer, I just need to vent."
62,Can someone help with my Dissociation,Hey I just found this via google search. I am feeling really empty and detached tonight I really don't know why. I used to have really bad depression but for the past year or two I haven't had issue with it. I still do have issues with dissociating which I think that's the right term for it. I feel so clouded and like I am not really here. I just want to talk with someone as my friends are all asleep. Thanks to anyone who replies.

64,How To Treat Mental Health,"Remove this if it isn't helpful or I dunno. (Marked NSFW for briefly bringing up 18+ content)

I've been dealing with mental health problems for years. I suffer from bipolar disorder, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, psychopathy, 'cutiephilia', autism, learning difficulties, and probably others. 2020 was both one of my best and worst years. There are things I found that nobody has ever really given. I find most treatments do not work, or are not effective enough. I have found some that do help. 

(this is just an audio version of what I'm saying) [https://youtu.be/c4Qofbfba\_o](https://youtu.be/c4Qofbfba_o)

&amp;#x200B;

**My story:**

There is no cure for mental health problems. And when I say mental health, I don’t mean the usual depression and suicidal thoughts. Both of which I’ve been through. I also don’t mean specifics like bipolar or personality disorder. I’m talking about paraphilias, psychotic thoughts, just being unhinged and violent. Whether intentional or not.

The biggest pandemic to sweep the Earth is mental health problems.

In my time of being alive, I’ve been through all of this. You might be wondering, how do I got here.

What? [**https://youtu.be/TKvjEQXKeec?t=21**](https://youtu.be/TKvjEQXKeec?t=21)

Point is, I have had many issues. All of what I listed I’ve dealt with, within myself. And I was in a dark place, probably like most of the people listening to this. What got me through it was, a lot of thinking and a change of mindset.

I found most of what made me the way I was, involved how I lived my life, rather than what was around it. Because I have more problems than I can list, it is hard to find a treatment, a one solution fixes all kinda thing.

But that doesn’t exist. It doesn’t.

After having been to the UK’s useless Crisis Team, being on anti-depressants, and therapy for my sexual orientation. I didn’t know these wouldn’t be cures. They were treatments. Knowing there was no cure left me worse off. I spent weeks panicking thinking “I should just kill myself, I pose a threat.”

That was until one of my multiplayer gaming sessions taught me an important lesson, where I used to be a toxic player. Eventually someone told me how it is to be on the receiving end, and got me to empathize with other players, which changed my perspective entirely. Now I can’t stand toxicity in games. This eventually led me to think about things I hadn’t thought about before. As strange as it is, this changed my entire life for the better. I became more empathetic to sentient life. So I changed my ways.

I finally found peace. Something that not many people have done. Unlike a personal experience or data, this is something that you can think about and find your own conclusions to. Simply avoiding violence when it isn’t necessary, is a very good way to pathe happiness for yourself and others. On top of that, I realized the importance of kindness. Along that journey, on top of finding my love for animals, and now practising veganism, I have found so much more that is important in life. It isn’t about this world that revolves around you. There are sentient lives who need you.

If you’re trying to help someone online build a PC, that’s great. You did a very kind thing there.

You could be helping someone in real life, like for example someone who is homeless, by donating food to them.

All of this, takes nothing from you. It’s a small thing that has quite an impact. Other people will see that kindness and want to be kind themselves. One of the, or maybe two, most influential people in my life, are my grandparents. They’ve shown kindness from the start, and as a child, taught me manners. Here’s the thing. They’re not fragile, mentally. They’re strong mentally. My grandfather players first person shooters on his Xbox, also is not afraid of gore, on top of showing kindness, with a bit of dad humour and dark humour. My grandmother is really thoughtful and very generous, on top of being a I guess, blanket? I mean that in a good way. She’s a safety blanket is what I’m trying to say, and much like grandfather, is not boring. It’s wonderful things like this that make me realize that the world isn’t such a bad place after all.

This leads into how to treat mental health.

\-

**I’ll sum it up first, then expand on the points later.**

1. Think about what makes you happy, and use it.
2. Face your fears.
3. Favour truth.
4. Distract yourself with focus heavy hobbies.
5. Love yourself.
6. Ignore other people
7. Be confident.
8. Kindness.

\-

**Now to expand on those points.**

1. Think what makes you happy and use it. By this I mean, if you are going through dark times, and need to avoid the dark thoughts, try to find something that makes you happy. It could be cute animals, it could be funny videos on YouTube or TikTok. It could be one of many things. It could be multiple things. For me personally, I enjoy masturbating. Yes, that does kinda make me happy.
2. Face your fears. This means you should embrace them. In my experience, pushing things away like sexual thoughts, psychopathic thoughts, and other dark thoughts, pushing them away makes them worse. And you may also have the empathy that I have, where you know these things are wrong to act on. Here’s a tip. Fuck yourself. No, really. I did this, and it helped. Rather than push these fears away, I instead used alternatives to them. With sexual thoughts, I found the alternatives to those in the form of say, a toy, or pornography. With psychopathy, you just watch disturbing videos. The point is, by the end of it, you should be desensitized, and you will burn yourself out, and no longer have the urges, for a while. They will become normal. Pushing these away, is just dangerous. With suicide and depression, try to make yourself as depressed and suicidal as possible, and you’ll just come out stronger. Cry even, that actually helps. Try to fight back directly doesn’t help, so you instead have to use an alternative. It’s like, and by the way this is a tip, choking on water. By coughing, you worsen it. By refusing to cough, it goes away faster.
3. Favour truth. The truth hurts. We all should know that by now. But it’s important that we don’t use an emotional response to it, by which I mean, rather than see a concept like Nihilism, as bad. See it as neutral. Don’t attach emotion. This way, you get your facts straight and get the most accurate answer. Once you have this, point seven will become more clear. Do your research, be smart, it will become clear from there. It’s like how knowing you have bipolar disorder for example, is just your brain playing you up. You won’t realize it when you have bipolar, but the knowing of it being basically, uncontrollable and part of you, should neither bring you joy or fear. It should just bring neutrality. Closure.
4. Distract yourself with focus heavy hobbies. This will vary. What has helped me is doing things that require full focus, whether that’s playing video games that have intense action or requires a lot of problem solving. Or it might be minesweeper. Or it might be knitting. Or it might be music. There’s many different ways to lose yourself in a hobby, and forget you ever had any problems. Recently, I found I needed to build a PC. I did a lot of research on what I needed, and have a set build which left me happier than a few days prior, where I was extremely depressed. I felt like I accomplished something by picking parts for my PC. Not only that, I somewhat enjoyed it. It’s weird, but I did. I’m yet to build it. Just distract yourself however you can. I have a list of things to do to keep me busy. So should you. Those things shouldn’t be chores either, which is why a game like World of Warcraft wouldn’t help in this situation, unless you enjoy those kind of chores.
5. Love yourself. By this I mean, buy things that bring you happiness, that actually matter for you. For me, recently I got a nice pair of gloves to solve the problem of my hands swelling up in the cold. And it helped. This made me happy because, the product did what the reviews said it did, and I got something that I will now use for a long time when going out. And that’s the point, you shouldn’t torture yourself, you should keep trying within a budget of course, to make yourself happy. There are vegan junk foods that make me really happy, and I keep trying new vegan foods because that brings me happiness. It doesn’t sadden me when I get something that tastes like crap. I enjoy that, because that is a learning experience. I love myself by doing what I desire, so long it doesn’t bring harm. The non-violence and happiness makes it all worthwhile.
6. Ignore other people. This is a good point to make. I live without a social life, and sure, I’m used to it, I can’t really tell other people how to deal with their social lives, and can’t say they should abandon it. But, people always suggest that “Talk to other people” shit that I keep seeing. This only burdens them and they will only read from a script. Instead, IGNORE THEM. You don’t need other people to tell you ‘there there, things will get better’. You don’t know that. In my situations, it only ever made things worse to talk about my issues, because people either didn’t listen, or did and pretended to care. I’ve also had to deal with many dishonest people in my lifetime, and they don’t do any favours either, knowing compulsive liars when I see them. So it really helps to just not listen to other people in those dark times. And no, this isn’t just to the people who mean good. It’s also the people who mean bad. Fuck those people. You know what you should do in that situation? Think better of yourself, and that leads nicely into the seventh point.
7. You need to be confident. I found the best way to overcome a feeling of uselessness is to get your facts straight, be honest with people. Whether you’re debating a topic you’re passionate about, or doing activism, get your facts straight, favour truth. Because the only person who is bringing you down, is yourself. I’m just saying it how it is, that is the truth. I know this. You know this. So in a situation like bullying, here’s how you diffuse that situation. You become stronger. You work out, you weaponize yourself, be it person or tool. You hunt the hunter. Because you will feel good when you knock down that obstacle. You will be happier. You ignore people, become stronger, and be confident, so you can face your problems accordingly. Also just getting straight up facts out there, even if that means dismantling a bully, is satisfying and makes you strong.
8. Kindness. This is something that applies to everyone. Another big plague taking place within society, is negativity and violence. It’s affecting us so poorly that we can’t even think. People are actively finding things to be negative about, and it needs to stop. We need to replace it with positivity, and also somewhat more important, kindness. We need to show each other love, respect, compassion, empathy. Everything that makes us good humans. Because when we can’t take care of ourselves, we really need others to help us. You may also get happiness from being kind.

\-

I hope these helped. I felt like this was a very important video to make to given 2020 has been the roughest year of, a lot of people’s lives. And my research into the NHS Crisis Team over here in the UK, angered me and made me a little depressed. And to start the new year, I want to spread some positivity and give some advice.

And thank you for caring for yourself, and others."
65,Get over it I was told...,
66,"feel paranoid, vulnerable and stressed due to accidentally uploaded a very ugly photo of myself online","Hi, a few months ago, i accidentally uploaded a very ugly photo of myself online, i deleted it several days later after realizing it, afterwards, i can't help but think about scenarios where people saw it and are mocking it, laughing at it, and judging me, especially my ""enemies"" or people i have beef with, i keep thinking about it for the entire day nonstop in loops, thinking that they are spreading it around, making fun of it in a group chat together behind my back, etc. This made me so stressed out that I began losing hair and balding on the sides, it's one of my worst fear, especially if my crush saw it. How do I overcome this? There's no proof that they saw it, but there's this intuitive feeling inside me telling me that they saw it, and it feels true, although I spent the entire day, analyzing the situation logically, and i came to the conclusion that they didn't see it, and they most likely haven't done anything, yet i feel so paranoid and anxious that they may have saw it and are judging it every single day ever since i found out i accidentally uploaded it."
67,Are suicide sitters allowed to sleep while in the room with you?,I'm in the hospital after a suicide attempt and have had sitters in my room at all times but my current one is just straight up passed out in the chair. I took some photos for evidence cause I feel like that's wrong.. I don't see a point in someone being in here with me if they're just going to be passed out. Her phone also started ringing at 2 am and woke her up that time and she answered a video call which I also didnt like. I'd be fine with a phone call but I dont want her to risk showing my face by answering a video call. I'm waiting for them to switch her out so I can ask the nurse but I'd still like an answer sooner than later.
68,Anyone tired of people making fun of mentally ill people?,"Especially those who have psychosis and act bizarre. There is this man who was psychotic, rambling about things that do not make sense, uploading inapporpiate videos of himself (not sexual, just inapporpiate), even harmed himself and all people did was laugh at him on social media. Yet these people claim to say things such as ""it's ok to not be OK :)"" and all that hypocritical b.s.. 

I'm tired of the lack of empathy people have these days."
69,alcohol is the only thing that even helps for a bit. I know it’s an unhealthy coping mechanism but can you blame me for wanting a bit of relief?,better then killing myself right?
70,Everything feels pointless. I'm exhausted,"I apologize to those who may come across this. I'm pretty much word vomiting, so my thoughts might not be as concise as I think they might be lol. (TW: mentions of suicide)

TL;DR: I'm always physically + mentally drained. Also, when I told my parents I felt suicidal, they brushed it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Today is my birthday, and as per usual, no one is home. It doesn't bother me much anymore, but it still feels a bit weird. Especially since it's my 18th. I remember back in May-July of last year, I was SO hellbent on ensuring that my 18th would be my last. Now it's all like, ""well, maaaaybe I can push it back a year.."" anytime something remotely positive occurs. But it's always temporary.

As of late, I've been trying to get myself out of this unknown rut I've been in since the summer. Tasks that should be automatic (showering, brushing my teeth, etc) drain so much out of me, that I end up sleeping for the rest of the day after doing them. Most times I literally can't do anything else. I want to believe it's just negligence on my part, however it is GENUINELY the most exhausting thing to even think about. But, by some miracle, I was able to do such, go for a walk, and cook something. I'm aware it's not a huge deal, but sometimes I wish my small efforts wouldn't go unnoticed by my parents. Not that they're home to know anyway lmao. There are many times I'm eager to tell them about the things I've been able to accomplish throughout the day, no matter how minute, and they always brush it off. And it's not just that. I distinctly remember them asking me what was wrong at the peak of my ""summerly rut"". I aired everything out. I asked them not to give any input. I wanted a listening ear. I told them if I made them uncomfortable or overwhelmed, they could tell me to pause at any moment.  I told my parents I wanted to die. Twice. At the time, I was certain that today, January 1st, was going to be my last day. I was hesitant to say that since we had lost a cousin to suicide a year prior. My mother and sister were particularly close to them. I tried to finish my explanation. All they did was walk away mid-sentence to finish folding laundry in the next room. Let me tell you, I was so stunned lol. I look back at it now and laugh about it though. I wish I knew what prompted such a response (or lack thereof). Perhaps it was overwhelming? I dunno. I probably should've asked at the time.

Fast forward to a week ago, and my mother asks me what's really going on. Again. I said it was nothing new. I thought she forgot about what I tried to explain to her and my stepdad in the summer. Apparently they remember it as clear as day. She told me something along the lines of, ""you just need to find out what you're interested in as a possible career choice!"" I'm still unsure of where that came from. Nevertheless, the more I tried to express how I felt, the more she'd talk over me about how ""you're going to look back at this conversation as an adult, and think about how far you've come."" **And the infamous**: ""WELL, people have it much worse than you! You have absolutely NOTHING to complain about. There's food on the table, a roof over your head, clean water. AND, for the time being, your responsibilities only consist of getting an education. You don't work. You don't worry about paying bills. I wish I was your age."" I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea. I simply went to sleep. It was pointless. Everything just seems pointless.

Anyways, I hope the start of the new year is treating you okay. It's been a shit show. I no longer want to be a participant of major historical events, thank you VERY much! We've have had enough lol. Stay safe."
71,Can ADHD be diagnosed even if it doesn't affect the person's life too much?,"I have suspicion that I might have ADHD but my symptoms doesn't seem to affect my life too much. (My grades aren't slipping, I don't really have trouble learning, etc. ) So I wonder can ADHD be diagnosed even if it doesn't affect the person's life a lot as I want to know if it is worth it getting tested."
72,Help needed - Research for a new mental health app,"I am currently developing an app designed to teach people the best way to support loved ones with mental illness.

73,Are antidepressants and antianxiety medications life sentences? Are there any pathways to no longer taking the drugs?,"Serious question, what cases have you seen where patients were winged off over time. It just seems there are always reasons to up doses and add prescriptions, but rarely to aim at a drug free life? Any experiences getting off these drugs?"
74,Need some help,Im not sure how but ive gained the ability to off myself without concerns about the holes il leave in peoples hearts. And im not feeling all that good rn need some cheering up
75,I didn't feel anything when either of my Grandparents died?,"This is a morose way to bring in the new year, but I (34 M) feel like it's very odd that I didn't feel much of anything when either of my Grandparents died. I knew them both my whole life. They were nice people, but I never felt any sort of connection to them. In fact I've always found it to be very difficult to connect with others. If someone in my immediate family died, I think I would take it pretty hard, but even then I'm not super sure.  
Think there's anything ""wrong"" with me, and if so, what could it be? Or is this pretty common? I always hear about people being very said when their Grandparents die, watching other people grieve in the moment when I don't feel anything. When people hear my Grandma died, they sent me messages like ""I'm so so sorry for your loss"", as if I was completely heartbroken which makes me think I should be caring much more than I do.

Again it's not like my Grandparents were people I disliked in the slightest, I just felt no connection to them, despite knowing them my whole life. I would see them often at get-togethers throughout the year, and they were always very nice to me and likeable people, but we never talked much at all or anything.

I thought for a while I might have Schizoid Personality Disorder, but I don't know if that fully checks out."
76,Why is anxiety so much worse in the morning?,"I don't think I've ever woke up and not been anxious. Also, does anyone get more depressed around the new year?"
77,"I have a suicidal friend who recently cut themselves, and I don't know what to do","I will call this friend Jane. I've known Jane since 6th grade and have had a group chat with us and another friend for a little under a year to vent about family and mental problems. Jane came out to us as trans this year and chewed me out earlier today for not being there for her in the way she wanted me to. After that, I apologized and left the chat so I didn't say anything else wrong, and Jane told my other friend that they had cut themselves the day before after a relapse. Obviously this sent me into a moment of panic, and that's why I'm typing this now. Jane is in possibly the worst situation. 

First, her family is composed of Christians who have stated on multiple occasions that transgender people are mentally ill, so she isn't going to get support from her family (her parents specifically, she has come out to her brother and I think that's it). Second, both me and my other friend live nearly six hours away, and do not have a license or our own car (we are both \~16 years old).

All of this has thrown me into a state of complete disarray and now knowing that Jane has committed self-harm terrifies me of what she would be willing to do next. I honestly have no idea what to do, and I want to do *something* to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Extra Info:

\-  Jane was mainly upset with me for not responding enough to things she posted in the group chat and voicing my opinion on certain memes she sends that seem more harmful than helpful. She was also mad at me for not being able to empathize, even though I more silently empathize for people, and I am used to not verbally expressing my concern and support for others (I know this is really bad, and I felt really bad about it and am trying to change).

\-  I didn't speak much in the group chat after a while because she had been upset that I respond in a way that makes me seem angry, but when I didn't talk as much, she thought I wasn't supportive.

\-  Jane has stated before that she doesn't get help due to her family possibly finding out about her being trans.

\-  I was mainly in the group chat to support Jane and the other friend, because I personally don't experience anything close to what they experience (my family life and mental health is pretty good). This is also why I struggle to understand what Jane has been going through with gender dysphoria, depression, and all the other terrible things that happen to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate this entire situation and I just want to curl up in a ball and hide until it's over, but I need to help. I know very well that I am in the wrong and I'm not looking for pity. I just want to know how to help just in case Jane does something worse. Tell me if I need to put more info and I will put it in an edit. I really need help now."
78,(TW!!) advice for a r survivor,"Hey all, I’m a F20 who was r’d by a M22 a year ago. I honestly was never able to get over it (can’t afford doctor visits) so being able to close that part of my life is extremely difficult. Because of this, I do a lot of heavy stalking because my anxiety tells me I have to see what’s happening with that person. Anyways, I was able to take a break but I did it again and I found out this said person is in a relationship now. I immediately felt my heart drop to my stomach because I have been fearing the day this person got into a relationship. I feel so so so much responsibility to tell her because if I start dating someone who did something like that, I would want to know. However, at the same time, it shouldn’t be my responsibility to police his actions and intervene in a relationship that’s not my own. I feel extremely conflicted. Please help."
79,Mental Health in the Workplace Stigma - Site and Survey,"Hi All,

I am an attorney and built a website around reducing the stigma around mental health in the workplace. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life and felt like a pariah in the legal field where mental health was hardly acknowledged and any issue was perceived as weakness. This problem still exists. While my site does focus on the legal industry, it’s mostly beneficial to all.

Mental health has become a HUGE problem for people in the legal industry and many still refuse to acknowledge that any issues even exist. This prompted me to create my site [Working Mental Health](www.workingmentalhealth.com)

The site is both a resource and an area where I am conducting research through anonymous surveys to publicly explore action items and make real, productive change. Currently, I am conducting a survey on the way job searching can affect mental health. Going through the results I have so far briefly, I can tell if I get a lot more results, there’s an opportunity to really make a difference here in an area that needs it so badly.

If anyone is interested in participating or collaborating with me on this initiative, please also let me know. The [anonymous survey is here](https://shrl.ink/uyiT) and any participation helps not only me, but I hope MANY others upon taking action based on the results.

Thanks for reading.

80,New year,"I need some help... 2020 has had it's up and downs and I can't get into the positive side. In the last month I found out I am having a second child, moving by myself, and my grandpa passed. I feel so awkward not showing emotions but idk what to do. Some background with the move I am military and will be doing a year away from the family and will be leaving 2 months after number 2 is due."
81,Everything feels so fake.,Can someone help me and explain to me why I feel like this. As a child I always felt like everything wasn't real or I was in a sort of coma dream. I would look at my hands and it wouldn't feel like my hands to me. Is this normal I've been feeling like this for ny whole life?
82,I feel like I'm growing to hate good days.,"I feel like I don't like good days anymore, it's like  because when whatever is making me happy disappears the default State just feels so much darker, so much more alone. Like the moment the discord call ends there's nothing left in me, I could have been laughing my ass of but I feel on the edge of crying once I'm alone. I wonder if the joy I felt was even real or if I just put on a show. I just don't know anymore."
83,[opinion/thought] PTSD caused me to have flashbacks of my ex and caused me to fall in love with him again.,"I miss my ex-boyfriend so much. I don't know what to do. I want to know if it's worth it to reach out. Help :((( if anyone else has experience with this, I'd love to hear how you fixed it. All advice is appreciated.

I keep having flashbacks of our relationship and it's causing me to fall in love with him again. I've tried everything. Suppressing these feelings by ignoring them has just made them worse. Everything reminds me of him.

I want to note that I always missed him, I've always been in love with him, but I thought I would move on with time. I've dated other people and tried to forget. It seemed to be working somewhat, but I have PTSD and I began having flashbacks to when we dated. These flashbacks just make my feelings for him worse. We dated right before a very traumatic time in my life, which is why I began having flashbacks to this time. My PTSD is relevant to this situation because I feel it makes it worse. What if it's all in my head, you know? What if I shouldn't reach out and what if I should plan my solution to this problem based on my PTSD?

I keep having flashbacks to the way he made me feel so loved and cared for. We got along so well, we talked 24/7. He is just an amazing person overall and anyone would be so lucky to have him. I also find him so beautiful to look at... which makes it worse.

I'm afraid to reach out because what if he has a girlfriend? I don't want to embarrass myself. It's been so long since we last talked (3 years). I'm afraid to talk about this with my friends because I'm afraid of being judged... how can I miss someone who I haven't spoken to in 3 years? I also worry that he doesn't have those same feelings for me anymore. I'm someone who NEVER talks about their feelings to anyone and I can't imagine trying to talk to him with the intention of getting close... just to be rejected. I feel it would be soooo painful.

The worst part is that we broke up because he felt I didn't like him anymore, which wasn't true. I was just dealing with sooo much in my life that we just never got back together, and I wish we did. I also have flashbacks of him trying to reach out to me again after we ended, but I was just not in the right mental space to talk to anyone. That's why it's 10x harder... because I KNOW he cared about me and I know he wanted to be with me. 

I also remember our mutual friends asking me ""do you like him still? you guys get along so well"" after we broke up despite me genuinely not showing any signs of liking him still, I have this hunch he wanted his friends to ask me so he could know if he should go after me again. All of these random reminders make me miss him so much more. It's getting so bad. I need help, I can't keep living like this."
84,Why Am I Afraid Of Repeating Myself?,"Sometimes when I'm in conversation with people, and they don't hear me they ask ""sorry could you repeat that?"" or maybe say ""I didn't hear you what was that?"" which is a normal thing to say, happens in conversations all the time. But when people say it to me I get physically stunned and incredibly nervous, I feel like I physically can't repeat it and just wanna cry or move on, I get uncomfortable. Why would that be?"
85,Disconnected to myself,"Hey guys, I feel as though I'm completely disconnected to myself, I don't know exactly how to explain it but I just feel like we are living a bad dream with the lockdown and everything. Every interaction I have with someone seems ""weird"" to me, I feel like the whole situation has shifted my perception of reality and what it means to be human. I'm on one hand looking forward for the lockdown to finish but on the other hand I'm not sure what I'm looking forward to. Anyone going through the same? I really just wish this whole feeling will go away at some point because at this moment it doesn't feel like it'll go away anytime soon."
86,"Everyone will leave me, I’ve decided to not fix myself.",No point in me trying anymore so if you want to curse me or call me a coward for wanting to die go ahead.
87,Freezing and Shaking,"Hi y’all! I was posting here because i don’t really know where else to ask for help on this. My anxiety and depression often make me stay up late or fall asleep for long amounts of time, and I’ve found that occasionally my body will begin having really bad tremors, yet my actual body doesn’t have any movement. I will sometimes freeze up and won’t move, and while my body is frozen I’ll feel like something is running up behind me to kill me or I’m being pinned and forcible can’t move. If someone could sort of help me pinpoint what it may be so I can bring it up with my doctor, that would be appreciated!"
88,Help!,I don’t feel happiness I don’t enjoy things. I don’t even know what I like. I don’t feel things. I’m empty no emotions. I do everything I can for my gf. Who I loved before things got this dark. I don’t feel real I ruminate all day. I over think and over analyze every conversation I have. It’s making work hard and I can’t function during the day during public outings.
89,Sucking the living joy out of every supposed happy occasion,"*breathes in*

Am i a vampire jxnsnsk because why tf can't i enjoy parties. At first i thought it was mood swings or some shi* but I've come to see a pattern with my behavior. Every party or social gathering I go to where people are smiling, laughing, and generally enjoying themselves, my mood just hits an all time low. I'm psyched for the event before it begins, and before I know it I'm suddenly hit with waveS of sadness, anger, and lonliness. I don't understand it anymore.

What's worse though is the anxiety I feel after the party takes place. People always want to capture the moment with piCTUREs and I HATE THIS. Knowing that i hated having to be there, and then taking pictures to immortalize it in the internet so I can relive all the negative feelings I felt is the absolute worse. During parties I always have to fake a smile otherwise people grow concerned when they see me frowning. Its exhausting.

After parties I tend to shut down and nitpick at my every conversation, every action, and my head explodes trying to process everything that happened. I get so emotional and I get bursts of anger for being a killjoy that I completely isolate myself for 3-5 days after every event. No social media, no hobbies, no mundane conversations, just me chilling in netflix and youtube trying to forget it ever happened.

Case in point. This new years eve my family went all out, since we had to celebrate new years at home. They prepared intensively on decorations, food, clothes, etc. I was thrilled about this event and could barely sleep the night before. My family decides to take a family photo before our DIY ""buffet feast"". I take one look at the dress i'm supposed to wear and I start breaking down. Bawling my eyes out as I pathetically put on the dress and avoid every reflection of myself myself, so I would StoP CRYInG. And believe me they aint happy tears. They're the angry i want to pull my own eyes out and cry myself an ocean type of ugly crying. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? WELP I GUESS MY BRAIN DECIDED ""hey you've been really happy leading up to this day, thats weird. Lemme fix that! "" We take pictures and I'm frowning and can't even fake a smile because tears would activate any time I tried to. Dinner begins and all I can focus on is trying not to cry in the middle of dinner. I then lock myself in my room and put loud obnoxious videos on blast to keep myself busy. It turns to new year and I feel numb.

This has happened before on numerous occasions during school events, hangouts, and such but I manged to contain my tears better in the past. It's the day after, and now I'm angry at every living soul that walks by me. I slept super late the night after and kept waking up in between. Binge eating everything I like. And typing this post because opening social media floods me with photos of the event that trigger my emotions. I feel like a tiking time bomb. I notice that this is making everyone around me confused and upset because I should be beginning the year on a high note, and yet here i am hiding under a blanket trying to find my gOOd SeNse. What's wrong with me? 


It's affecting my life because I can't enjoy family events or hangout with friends. I cancel all plans or make excuses to not go because I know I'll hate everyone in the party, including myself if I do decide to go. Everytime I feel this my mind wanders to bad places and I don't want to go there again.

(Q&amp;A if u've made it this far) 
 How do i better myself? Am i anti-social? AM I JUST A BITC* HAHAHAHA? Is this a sign of anxiety? Am i possibly depressed???? IS MY TEENAGE ANGST AND HORMONES ACTING UP? (if this is the case where is the fast forward button because I am so over this phase)... Do i have body image issues maybe? Hmm perhaps im chronically and severely camera shy or dramatic, if so IS THIS NORMAL? Has anyone else felt this way? 

*breathes out*"
90,"I've decided to ""not care""","Humans are social creatures. 

For better or worse we get together to exchange resources. But unlike ants or the like, we're not perfect. Time and time again we've proven that a good many of us don't actually care for one another. 

We're not built to socialize out of heart's desire. We have to deal with people we don't like, cooperate with people we're not fond of, with hyprocrisy, pretense, swindling, two faced back-talking, and people who just want to take advantage of each other and societies while pretending not to be.

It's not a pretty picture. One I'll never accept.

Fortunately for me, I'm not interested in a lot of what they have to offer. I have the internet for education, entertainment, and information. I'm not an attention seeker on the most part. I like playing games and they help me with dopamine happiness. I like making things, programming, and I'm still learning to paint and compose so I can create my own games. And I have something I don't want to tell here but it keeps me going. I have many dreams, and they may be very tough to attain, but fortunately they never involve other people. 

But I do enjoy companionship. It's just that my opinion of humankind has been very low for a very long time, even before Trump and Corona, and it has gotten nothing but worse. I didn't want to sift through the mud to find diamonds in the rough. 

Time and time again I imagined ending this world because of how short sighted and ignorant most people are and because human relationships are never what I want it to be.

It's often iterated in the mental health slogans that we can't make everyone love us, that some are bound to hate us for whatever reason, and that we should not care about the opinions of others too much. But humans are still social creatures who still have to care about reputation. And that reputation as I described above is, more often than not, based not on justice, sincerity or decency but on superficial matters like how loud or attractive one is, or how much they say what others want to hear instead of the truth, or how crafty and sly one is to manipulate the masses.

And they're so proud of it too.

I've not been sure I wantes to deal with it. It's obviously much better than the past that someone like me can still survive. But I look at politics and humanity in my country (Korea) and the world and I just feel like...

Anyway the point is I've decided to... not care.

It's not so much that I don't care about what others think about me anymore. I think that's bravado and I'm not sure that's possible or even desirable. 

But over the years I've slowly and subtly gained a ""social courage"" of sorts. Not in the way you think I suppose, more like ""anti-social courage."" And my opinion of humankind has always been low, but I've always tried to value and have compassion for everyone up until now.

And I won't ever give that up to someone who deserves it or who really needs it. But I think I've gotten to the point where I can truly tell good and evil apart. And whatever evil has to say about me blows through me. Because I don't care about them and thankfully I'm not dependent on them. 

I know some parts of the world that says good and evil don't exist, that it is relative. But that's part of what I'm saying. I don't care if it's relative or absolute anymore. I'll just follow my own instincts for good and evil. Both my light and my darkness tell me good and evil exist. I have literally no reason to not listen to it.

It's tough to explain. It's not an ""I don't care and I'll move to the mountains and live alone"" thing. It's not even a ""fuck you I'll do whatever I want."" I've always been doing that anyway. 

It's that I found that the best way the disempower evil is to not give it a second thought. To cut ties with it, and strengthen ties with good instead. To be free of its judgment, and most of all - its will.


I wanted people to be kind to each other. Sure we can jest and joke around. Sure what's a world without a bit of colors? But I just wished people could be decent and just at heart even though I knew we never could. 

Now I don't even see them as one of me.

I still have to care. We're humans. We're social for better or worse. We're dependent on each other not only for survival but also for entertainment, comfort, and even warmth. We have to learn how to reach out, adjust, behave, and even defend ourselves. And hell will freeze over before I let go of love.

But...

I really hoped we could get along but...

But I will never let social pressure get in the way of my wisdom. 

And I will not let evil influence my life any longer.



I ask you to do the same.

I'm sure many of you have it bad. Many of you have bad influences in your immediate vincinity unlike me. And I know how bad it is when people tell you to just stop caring about what they say to you, especially when they're physically stronger than you, or you're financially dependent on them. 

But if there's a toxic influence in your life... and you know it's evil... don't ever forget to love life, accept the challenge, and that you have the strength within you to will yourself out of that situation - and I'm not saying this just to make you feel better. I'm saying this because it's true.

And if it's just verbal abuse... don't ever forget that they don't exist in your life because you killed them in your heart. 

They can't get to you.


And I pray one day you will find true companionships, devoid of what humankind has made of relationships today."
91,Panic attack due to... hand,"This is the first time I am experiencing this and it overwhelms me. I have some self harm scars on my left hand from a few years ago, but even though they are healed, they are still very much visible.

I was reading something about skin today and I think this was the trigger, but ever since then I have been feeling extremely anxious about my scars. I can't touch them or look at them, my heart is pounding and it feels like I'm on my 7th coffee of the day. I am shaking. I literally have no problem with my scars and I couldn't care less about seeing them so I have no idea why this is happening.

I feel as if I am desperately trying to hide my hand from my view, even in uncomfortable positions, around my back. I am covering my hand with a pillow right now and it feels as if I need to hold pressure on it. It feels as if those scars are pulsating but I know this is only in my mind.

It feels like I am going insane and I am in the mids of a panic attack again because I can't stop feeling like this, my damned hand is bothering me.

What's... happening?"
92,Will life get better?,"I’m guessing I’m not the only one but 2020 was the worst year of my life. It started off with me being 15 and getting tinnitus (which has permanently changed my life) and paranoia, anxiety and at some point depersonalisation from traumatising events. I figured out my girl friend had used me as a rebound for the 6 months we were together. Figured out my dad was moving for the next 5 years for work. But the worst one is that my friends, the people who I thought loved me the most put pretty much no effort into hanging with me. I’m always making effort and if I’m not making the effort I’m just not invited, I’ve lost many friends from 2019 who I loved so much as they’ve moved out of my life and there was nothing I could do. I’m sick of this shit, everytime I think things are getting better they fall to shit. Everyday I’m sad, I see people hanging out everyday without me, I’m fucking done with this shit. How has anyone else who went through situations like this come out ontop or delay with it because I’m on the verge of giving up on life. I’m stuck and I feel so sad and helpless."
93,If I don’t get help I might do something,"I (22f) have diagnosed BPD and I lost my favorite person in November. I’ve been unable to let them go and I’ve constantly harassed them with calls and texts. I’ve already talked to my therapist and I know these behaviors are bad and acting on them makes things worse for both parties, so I had stopped and tried to keep moving on. Of course with my personality disorder and the fact my ex FP and I were trauma bonded, the last few weeks have been very on again, off again “i miss you/I hate you.” But I still didn’t contact them. Now my thoughts are getting more violent the more I leave them alone. I have intrusive thoughts about ruining his car and now I have thoughts of actually harming him. I’m scared and I don’t know if I should tell my therapist. I know rationally I won’t act on them, but I’m afraid it’s like the thoughts of calling him, that I’ll just act on them if I keep thinking about it."
94,My husband needs help but refuses to talk about getting help,"I just had a conversation with my husband about his mother and all that may happen in the near future. You see, she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer in the summer of 2019. We found out she learned about it too late and it had already spread to her brain. She fought it and it shrank but I knew it would come back. Well we just found out that it did. She has 3 new spots in her brain and they were determined to be cancerous. She'll be starting radiation and chemo soon and it will take such a toll on her. My husband is struggling with coming to the realization that it may be too late for her.

He has always had mental health issues that he refuses to talk to anyone about. He won't talk to anyone for fear that he will be institutionalized and forcefully medicated. I don't know how to help him. I am a nursing student and have taken a mental health class but I am nowhere near qualified to try and help him through this. 

He says that nobody will understand the thoughts that are going through his head and there's no point talking to anyone. He says that when he was a kid that he dreamed that he wouldn't live to be an old man and he is expecting to die within the next 5 years. He was the one to find his grandmother who passed away and he was responsible for getting all the adults so they could try and save her. He witnesses his cousins attempt to rescussitate her, breaking her ribs in the process. His father was a drug addict and his first memory of him was learning how to make some drug. His father rejected him saying that he wasn't his and treated him horribly. He won't talk to me about traumas that happened to him as a child (even though I went through the same thing).

I've asked him multiple times if we could talk to someone who specializes in trauma, he says no. I've asked if we can talk to someone about marriage but he refuses. I've asked if we could just try to talk to someone who is willing to listen to what happened to his grandmother and what's happeningbtobiis mother to help him work out his feelings and he is refusing! His thoughts are scary. He is saying that he is accepting that he won't live long but isn't suicidal  so I shouldn't worry about him. And other scary thoughts. I don't know what to so anymore."
95,I can't tell if I'm depressed or just being overdramatic and needy.,"For the past few weeks, or maybe even months (I can't really remember how long its been), I've been extremely lazy and unmotivated to do anything. I'm a guy and turned 18 back in august and I've started college this semester and am wanting to be able to transfer to a different college next semester, but I have just lost the motivation to try hard or do anything in classes. I know that a lot of people find it hard and struggle to work for online classes, but its been a real cause of stress for me. I think? I honestly can't really tell. I believe it's super annoying to pretend to be depressed and for some reason it seems to be a trend to fake it recently. I would really like to find out so I'm not doing this.

I've been in the same cycle for a while also. For a while now I have done nothing but stay locked in my room, but who hasn't recently? I have just been repeatedly watching youtube, twitch, and anime and occasionally playing video games that I know from high school. I try to be happy when I meet up with them, but one of them sort of noticed with a comment like ""Hey c'mon I invited you over, what are you moping for."" I naturally shrugged it off but it bothered me after for a while and recently I can't stop thinking if I just don't look like a normal person. Anyway, there are sometimes where I really appreciate them but recently I've started nit picking at some of the smallest things and noticed myself being real hostile towards a few of them. I'm afraid that they will start to get hurt by my inconsiderate comments so I try not to speak as much anymore because I don't want to hurt them since I really care about them. Another time my friends and I met up during the weekend and had a few drinks and I can't really control what I say while I'm drunk especially since it was only my 3rd time being drunk. I was talking a little too much and said something stupid like ""I don't remember the last time I have genuinely smiled."" and my friends at the time immediately dismissed it. He brought it up again later saying how stupid that was and I felt really hurt but just decided to ignore it. I don't think I want to drink again for a while.

I also have a pretty negative view of my body. I know, crazy right? Another angsty teen is insecure about their body. Anyway I'm around 5'9ish and at one point was borderline overweight. After that I started trying to cut back on eating. This got pretty bad I think. I completely stopped eating for 6 or 7 days, drank only around 2 or 3 bottles of water in this time period, and was constantly checking my belly to see if anything had changed since I don't have a scale to see if I actually lost weight. This was around 2 weeks ago and even now I have only been able to eat one meal a day and not going over 600 calories. I realize that this actually probably hurt my body more than helping it, but I just can't bring myself to go over that. I also plan to start running on a treadmill soon, but I'm not sure if that will happen. I get anxiety when I'm in social situations but I guess this is pretty common for a shut in who barely interacts with others.

As I said earlier I've been doing nothing but wasting my time recently. There are productive things I could do, especially having to do with school, but every time I start thinking about it I just get super scared and have to my mind off of it almost immediately. My family is really pushing me to take a career path I don't think I want to take, but I don't feel like I have the right to say no to them. One time I tried to forced myself to try to be productive but that just led to a terrible anxiety attack with me curling up in a ball and crying on the floor. Even the things I do waste my time doing I barely find enjoyable anymore except watching anime which I can only do for a few hours at a time. I find myself ""lingering"" a lot recently. I don't really see a purpose for myself to do anything or continue doing anything. The one thing keeping me going is finding someone who cares about me romantically, but as I am now I don't think I could even manage that.

Again, I can't tell if I'm being overdramatic and reading way far into situations that shouldn't worry me or seriously. There are **a lot more** things I want to write out, but I'm already making this long enough and I really want people to read this. To end I have a series of questions I would like to ask.

Am I just being ridiculously sensitive or do I really need help?

If I do need help how should I get it? My family definitely would not support me if I told them how I feel simply because of the way they were brought up and are.

How should I go about dealing with my self image?

Should I let my friends know?

Thanks for taking the time just reading this. I've been thinking about this for an extremely long time and I would really appreciate a response. I also would want you to be honest, please don't sugarcoat anything you truly feel. Again, Thank you. Seriously."
96,"I repressed sexual abuse in my childhood and it's all coming back to me suddenly. Im having a really hard time. I repressed it completely, and now I don't know what to do.","I don't know if this is a safe space to share what happened to me, so I will spare the details for the safety of other's triggers. 

I have been struggling with intrusive thoughts every night for the past two months. I can't sleep unless I pass out because I have to keep my brain busy with things until then, but recently at any alone time I have begun to remember things that I did not even know I repressed. 

And reliving it is putting me through so much pain. I am scared for the day that I remember something potentially worse than what I have remembered thus far. It has only been the last few days but already two vivid memories have been brought back to me and I feel so disgusting. I don't know how to deal with this. I was a child. 

And even now, I'm not old enough legally to see a therapist, and my mom doesn't permit those types of things. And opening up to her about this is not a welcomed conversation, she tends to gaslight me when I open up to her about things. 

I don't know.  I just feel so disgusting. I don't know how to deal with this."
97,I needed to vent and idk what to do,"Hello, I'm here to vent ig. Idk if it'll help XD nothing really does. I'm a 20 years old girl. Where do I start... okay so my uncle died last month. He had an old horse I have a lot of memories with which was sold after he died. My dad was running for the nomination as mayor. In my country one person can enter from each party and others can enter as independent. So his party, the ruling party rn, promised him he'll get it this year as he let it go last time. So he did his best to show them he's worth it. Donated a lot, did a lot of community service, all while his rival, the previous mayor for whom he let it go sat and watched. All of them agreed he'll be give the nomination this time. But 2 days before it was to be finalized,which is a week after my uncle died, we got news his rival bought EC for 3 million USD. All of his hard work for 3 whole months bought just like that. Now we're richer than average middle class, but by no means are we millionaires. He waited 5 years for this. Everyone, even the mayor kept putting hopes in him. He didn't show it but we could tell he was sad. My youngest uncle decided he's going to run for the election independently. In my country, that's completely legal, as by name we're democratic. But by name only. The ruling party makes sure no one with any possibility of winning can run against them. So he was to be arrested. My dad  was a party member so he wasn't part of it. But the son of his rival, fed the police 500k USD to arrest my dad and do a sweep in all of our family homes. They took him in and used really insulting words with him. As a man with very high self respect, that broke my dad. He didn't leave the house for a week. Didn't eat properly. It broke my heart to see him like that. Me and my sister did our best to show him it doesn't matter. To us he'll always be our superhero. I can't imagine the pain he's going through and it's making me feel absolutely devastated. Now he's doing better and back to his old self. But the thoughts of him having to listen to those words won't leave me. I was supposed to hang out with my friends for 31st but I wasn't allowed to leave home for the risk and I didn't tell them about what happened as it's political and outsiders can't know. They called me and I said I can't go and they sounded so fed up with me. This isn't the first time I had to do this. I saw my friends 5 times this year and not because of covid. I had to cancel plans last minute more than 10 times this year alone. Yesterday seeing everyone just having fun, kinda broke me down. I can't tell them that. What will I say? I hate you all for having fun not caring about my existence when I'm going through shit? I can't do that. But I am feeling resentful. Not one text in my inbox. Not one call. It's like I never existed in their lives. Last year my boyfriend stayed on call with me all day to make me feel less lonely. This year he's also out having fun. And this year I needed him more XD I hate feeling this way. I hate myself for feeling this way. I know they have their own lives and no one's bound to make me feel better. But I can't stop crying over it. I can't stop hating everyone for it. I can't stop being mean to my boyfriend for it. It comes out unintentionally. How do I stop this. At this point it's taking the world out of me to get out of bed. I haven't showered for a week and my skin is acting up again and my head is full of dandruff. Oh and I have admission tests coming up and I can't study for it anymore. My parents are expecting me to get into the best college and I'm not even studying an hour a day. I'm considering suicide before the tests just so I don't have to see the disappointment in their faces. But that's a story for another time ig. This post got so long omg. Sorry."
98,Do mental hospitals cater to trans people?,I'm transgender and feeling really badly right now. I'm having thoughts about checking myself in but I'm afraid of being thrown with a bunch of dudes.
99,Where do I begin to change myself?,"This is a long post, but I feel like I want to get this off my chest but also need some help in what to do next. I will make it clear from the beginning that I do have depression and it was medicated for a time, but I have no longer been able to get medication due to the virus. I am not suicidal and have not had thoughts of self harming at all.

&amp;#x200B;

As it comes to new years, I look back at my life and realised that I needed to take a look at myself in terms of my whole life until now and see why I feel the way I do. 2020 was the worst possible time for all of this to happen for me, and I feel like I've spiralled heavily in this year and now seems like the time where I need to change, but I don't know where to start.

At the beginning of 2020, I was an 18 year old heading towards my A-Levels. I had just finished doing mocks, but the actual exams were approaching. During those mocks, my exam anxiety had gotten extremely high, to the point where I was having nightmares leading to anxiety attacks that kept me inside all day. And colinked with that was a depression that loomed over the year. But I felt like the anxiety attacks were getting better and that I could handle a full exam - only for COVID to hit. My exams were cancelled, and instead the government used predicted grades: heavily based on my anxiety-ruined mocks.

That ruined my summer, as I spent the entire time wondering and waiting for my results, praying that they ended up being OK, that I at least got into my reserve Uni. They weren't and I did, leading to another month scramble to get into a Uni through clearing.

University has been fine for me, even if I struggle to engage with a mere computer screen telling me facts over and over for my seminars and lectures, but it hasn't helped my growing lack of emotions in that time. Once the fear of my exams left... I haven't felt much otherwise.

I did seek help from a therapist early into the summer from my college, and I never fully got the help I needed from them because of an engrained issue of lying. It sometimes feels like pathological lying, but in my mind I know there are reasons behind it, reasons why I've lied. I've done it since I was young, very young, and I want to stop it but I'm not sure how.

I lied about death in the family, injuries, things I'd seen that had trauimitized me, my mental state, how well I was doing in school, all for one reason or another.  When I was younger, I would look at kids with inhalers or glasses and get jealous because of how they were treated what felt like more kindly than me. I tried to fail an eye test just so I could be given glasses. The optician could easily tell I was faking - and it annoyed me that he'd figured me out. During Primary and Secondary School, I would dream about getting injured just to go into school and get the same sort of notice that other people did when they had casts or any of that. I wonder if that was out of jealousy of how they got treated better, or a cry for help for someone to actually notice me. Because I don't know either way.

Recently, I began to wonder if I was different in other ways - and my mother informed me she'd never felt it right to give me or my brother autism or ADHD tests, since we ""had no issue making friends"" and ""excelled at primary school"" leading to me wondering if perhaps I do have ADHD due to my impulsions, inability to connect with some work, lack of social ability and other factors (my brother may also have tourettes or something along that line with his physical ticks he has, but if so it's a minor thing.)

I worried I was a sociopath for a while, but I feel like worrying I am one is a good sign I'm not. I do feel emotion, in some cases I'm probably too emotional to the point where I seem emotionless, but one bad word from someone I like, or one bad day, can break me for weeks.

My only highlight of 2020 was being able to play more D&amp;D, as that is the only actual thing I find any solace in anymore, the only time I smile or laugh or find myself happy. All my other hobbies bring me nothing but an ability to pass the time now.

I can't go into 2021 like this, I feel like I need to change. What do I do? Where do I begin in changing myself here?"
100,I have had this constant brain fog and have been living in autopilot mode for the past 1.5 years.,"I am the scapegoat of my family. My parents and sibling are narcissist with victim mentality. I was very depressed throughout my high school years. After hs, I moved away from family to different city (for studying) for around 1.5 years. Staying alone in a different city in the way I wanted with no one around to blame me for things I never did, making me feel guilty for breathing and experiencing new things on my own, with no one monitoring me every minute ( only facetimed twice or 3 times a day with family) helped me learn a lot about myself and made me much stable and stronger mentally and emotionally.

My parents despite of all the emotional negligence and mental torture always made sure I never had any problem regarding money. They always sent me monthly pocket money and gave me extra money without any questions if I asked (probably because I was pretty disciplined and responsible). So, I said to myself 'As long as they support me financially, I will just ignore everything they say or do and live like just another person in the house. I can do it!' 

So, after returning home I just listened to whatever they said, only spoke whatever they wanted to hear and never talked back. At first they were pissed. Me just accepting everything and keeping to myself and not reacting strongly, trying to help more around house annoyed them. Slowly they accepted, but I was now no longer just a scapegoat, I was their emotional dumping site too (I still am)

 I am not depressed now, but I am numb. I cannot feel emotions like I used to. On one side, it is a blessing considering the type of people I live with. But I  also cannot feel happiness, excitement, thrill, motivation, passion about stuff like others do. I do feel anxious and upset sometimes, but that's it. 

I cannot move out permanently until I get married or go to another country. I cannot go for therapy or get a part time job to get out my house. My parents pay for my college and I have difficult major. I also cannot bring myself to talk to people around me (friends and cousins) due to all the trauma caused by listening 'you are a burden, mistake and cause of all problems' my whole life till now.

I have important exams starting from January 16 and I even have a solid plan to get through them, but I cannot even start revising. Everytime I sit in front of the revision paper, I feel like I am having anxiety attack. Even when I convince myself that it's ok and I can do it, I cannot focus and the day passes with me doing nothing. 

I don't know what to do anymore."
101,What is the difference between overthinking and „generalized anxiety disorder“?,?
102,My family's unrealistic expectations drain my energy,"My family's expectations are too high and nothing will make me a better person if I don't become a world renowned professor who is perfectly representing her gender role (just a stupid example). That aside, they cannot bear to see the fact that I'm a single lady who is free spirited and doesn't allow anyone in her life unless they are nice and pro feminist. Unfortunately I have still been living with them due to the economic problems I face. I have been trying more than I can and the result is pretty much disappointing for them. They are definitely toxic and associate the concept of parenting with being toxic and intervening in their daughters' lives. What I have done so far doesn't mean anything to them as I'm not married to a well paid man or good at cooking or whatever the gender role I'm expected to demonstrate. Successful, modest and obedient. I have developed impostor syndrome due to their disrespectful behaviours whereas all of my colleagues and admins keep telling me I'm excellent at my job. I have a feeling that I kinda deceive them. Yesterday I visited my grandfather for 15 min to celebrate his new year. He told me I'm not doing good enough and missing out a lot of opportunities. He once said I'm wasting my time working as a teacher and serving privileged spoilt kids. I told him I like my job and I'm really good at it. Omg nobody sees how hard I'm trying to be a good teacher and keeps looking down on me. Similarly, I just learned that I got a new job which is something I have been dreaming about. My mum didn't even show a sign of happiness and my father just said I just exist to complain about everything and incapable of doing anything useful. I feel so horrible to put up with these people. They have never said ""congrats"" to me in my entire life. Very simple to say, right? It's too bad when you know what are your triggers but having no opportunities to change anything at the same time."
103,Thoughts of mine,"On the outside I'm passive. Mom thinks she has me figured out just because I have autism, but still expects me to act like a ""normal"" person. She expects me to know everything about relatives and their stuff just because I see them a couple of times a year. I can't even do stuff that I like to do just because ""I should be doing stuff others are doing at my age"" and ""It's childish to like this"". I shouldn't just throw away everything that I like doing just because I get older. Constantly bugging me about how ""she understands and supports me"", while in reality she is bragging about her amounts of information and expecting me to know things just because ""I have to"". Like she expects me to know literally everything about anyone. ""Who wrote this?"" ""What did your sister do when she was young?"" ""You should know these things"". Then there is dad. He's really childish on arguments and entitled. Likes to say the obvious thing when not needed. ""Dig there"", when I have been doing just that. Won't change his opinions and when losing resorts to acting like a dummy. So, those are my parents. My opinions don't really matter to them. They talk behind my back and generally make me feel miserable. Loosing hope, loosing sight. Just... I want to kill myself, but can't because even the thought of death scares me. I want to live by my own rules and be free of this torment. Be free to express my art and other content I want to do. Lost almost all of my friends this year and grannny died. Even the therapist was replaced, meaning I have to do all of that ""getting to know you"" stuff all over again. That's actually a good way to say it shortly. A loop. Loop of mindtorment, losses and waiting as long as I can. Day after day. Before I lose my mind and let loose."
104,I started antidepressants and medication for my anxiety and this is how I feel.,"So hey! I started going to the psychiatrist two days ago and quickly got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was in such a bad state. I just started meditation today and maybe it's just my mind tricking me but I feel so much better not as jittery and scared/anxious that I used to be. I woke up and actually dried the dishes and made my bed. 

Its only been day one. Maybe I'll update as I go but is this normal"
105,What is the cause of feeling fine one day and exhausted the next for no apparent reason?,"It doesnt even make sense at all. Youre happy one day and severely deflated/fatigued the next. I sleep the correct length of time. So frustrating, all of it. Life is just way too complex"
106,I'm worried that I may have something wrong with me,"recently I have noticed that I have been acting weird, like I have been procrastinating things I normally enjoy (like art), things I need to do (like homework and schoolwork in general), I have been unwilling to sleep, daydreaming in class, being more sad than usual, not wanting to go outside, being tired, and only really wanting to eat and game, is there anything wrong with me? (I have also been getting earache if that helps)"
107,I feel paranoid and hear whispers...,"Hey Reddit!

I want to ask about something serious, so I hope that this is the right place to do so.

Btw, this is a throwaway account...I want to be sure that no-one I know in real life will read this, hence why I use this anonymous account.

Anyway...I've been dealing with depressive thoughts (don't want to say depression, because I have never got diagnosed) and selfharm..this has been going on for the last four years...I tend to isolate myself a lot, and I don't really have any friends, so I spend a lot of time on my own..This doesn't bother me that much, because I'd rather be alone most of the time, but I do get lonely sometimes..

Lately I've been experiencing weird things..I've been feeling very paranoid, and whenever I'm in public I fear that people are watching me and talking about me behind my back and plotting something against me. I've also checked my room for cameras and microphones, because I feel like someone has put surveillance in my room to spy on me. I've seen a few black shadows as well...Last night I saw a black silhouette with glowing red eyes and it freaked me out...this was at like 2 am at night so I went straight to sleep afterwards. Sometimes I hear whispers, especially at night. I can't really make out what they are saying, it's kind of like a radio or TV that is on, but in another room. I accused my brothers of talking with their friends at night, but they were both asleep and told me that it could not have been them talking...I also keep checking my curtains because I have this weird feeling that someone is standing outside my window looking at me. I have really weird thoughts about aliens or the government having planted a microchip in my mind so that they can control my thoughts...this is really scary and it's creeping me out...I haven't talked with anyone about it, because they'll probably think I'm crazy...I try to reassure myself that this can't be real, but on the other side it seems so real.

Has anyone ever experienced this? 

TL:DR: I have weird thoughts of being watched, and I see and hear things that others don't."
108,Every day is a chance to be better,"New Years is a great time to recognize that fresh starts are all around us. Doesn’t have to come from flipping to a new calendar.

109,How to get through COVID-19 depression,"Hi everyone,

It’s now 2021 and I feel no better than I did last year when COVID was announced. In March of 2020 I lost my job, 2 both grandfathers and then I got another job but was let go just last week because of the 2nd lockdown. I have nothing really to do everyday but wake up, eat and sleep. 

It’s very cold here in Toronto since it’s winter time and since everything is closed there’s nothing to do outside anyway. I have money saved up and I feel like I should take a week trip to Vancouver in March or April to see the outdoors and clear my head. My girlfriend doesn’t really want to go anywhere, but she’s worried because of the cases atm and she has a lot more going on right now than I do. 


How is everyone else getting through the lockdown related-depression?"
110,I don't know how to get my life together :(,"I just need to vent soooo, bit of background info: in 2015 (when I was 14) I got diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia. The body dysmorphia was the worst for me because it caused me to stop going to school, stop seeing my friends entirely, and stop leaving the house up until the beginning of 2020. So 14-18 were years spent only in my room, and if I did leave the house for therapy, I'd be covering my face and couldn't talk, so nothing really ever worked.

At the beginning of 2020 (great timing I know lmaooo) I was put on some drugs that really helped with my body dysmorphia in particular, and I was able (with a bit of work) to leave the house without covering my face, but because I no longer have any friends, education, confidence or any skills that I should have considering I'm turning 20 this month, I'm really really struggling with life. I'm doing better in some ways but of course mental illness doesn't go away, and everyday I still feel so lonely and sad and unmotivated because of the way my life is. 

I don't know how to get out of this, besides death, but I know I'd never go through with that because of my little sister. I want to apply for a job and go to college and make friends and be normal like everyone else my age, but I still have social anxiety and I'm still not confident in myself because those years alone were really damaging. I know I definitely need therapy and maybe a higher dose of medication but since Covid my psychiatrist stopped contacting me and I'm afraid to initiate help again, I've never been good at asking for help. I feel so hopeless that it's making me want to curl up into a ball and live how I used to before :( I don't know what to do besides give up."
111,Celebrate Day 1 (81),"2021, 1/365. 

We have stepped in. We have stepped into the **GREATEST** year of our lives. 2020 was for constant lessons and evolving. 2021 is for constant lessons and miracles. Hold **Faith &amp; Trust.**

I hope you wrote things down that you want to accomplish; ""goals"", ""resolutions"", if you have been waiting to start them when the New Year flipped over, **WELL,** here we are. **GET TO IT.**

There are no more excuses. We have all been shown how life can change very quickly, how we must focus on what we love to do &amp; who we want to surround ourselves with, day to day. This year is the year to focus on that business, focus on painting, focus on music, focus on writing that book, focus on your identity, sexuality, meditation, healing, focusing on whatever it is that **YOU** are passionate about**.** Our lives are all so precious and what should be realized is perspective; how precious every morning that we are allowed to wake up is a blessing, every moment we are allowed to breathe and be one with God/Mother Earth is a blessing.

Try. Taste. Realize its not for you, then go and try something else. There are 1000's and 1000's of different areas to improve upon, from creative to personal self, to entrepreneurship, to self awareness, empathy &amp; compassion. It is truly beautiful how abundant this world is, how there is truly a limitless source of opportunities, blessings, miracles and healing for **ALL** of us; the only thing is though, **YOU** have to go and search for it. I am still searching daily, searching for a moment of presence, searching for healing, searching for my true self, I know it will all come to me, with day to day practice.

**WE HAVE WALKED INTO THE GREATEST YEAR OF OUR LIVES.** Start right now. Get to it.

**I love you.**

112,"Struggling to show emotion, why do people do this?","I feel awkward, or even maybe shy showing my true feelings sometimes, like when I see people overreact to some things, I can't believe it.

I am afraid of also showing people I am disappointed too, it's not so much afraid but the awkwardness I feel. I don't really know why i'm like that, or if its really common at all. 

It just sucks, I also have trouble saying no to some things, Like I feel like people would always hold it against me. My therapist said I ruminate on things too much, and sometimes i can't get things out of my head that are troubling.

It's getting a little better, but things like crying ect, I could never dream of showing someone, I don't want people to know i'm sad, or even in pain.

What causes this in people?"
113,"I don’t feel real anymore, I’ve been getting hallucinations (If u hv professional experience related to psychology pls help me out )","Am I even real. I feel numb all the time. I have constant paranoia about something that’s gonna drive me to kill myself agin . I don’t feel in the right place ever. I fake emotion to others cuz I don’t want others to worry about me. I tried to kms 4 times in 2020. The 4th time was on Dec 30th. After I self harm/try to kms I feel better/numb for a month or so and then the cycle repeats. When I was younger I used to see hallucinations of a swarm of insects just going over walls and over me and I could feel them on me , but that was caused bcuz I used to secretly eat medicine a lot. This happened hen I was 6 yrs old. But for some reason , now the same hallucinations came back. No I don’t do drugs or drink or smoke , yet this happens . I get sleep paralysis a lot nowadays , more than usual. 
My childhood wasn’t the best but it wasn’t the worst. My dad is kinda abusive/misogynistic especially when he drinks to my mom and I remember seeing this constantly throughout my childhood. My parents got to know when I tried to commit suicide (it was the 3rd time that yr) , all the did was tell me that there are others who have bigger issues and they deal with it fine sometimes. I’m not saying that their wrong but I don’t think it was right for them to tell me that when I tried to suicide that day. Now when I cry and even sometimes panic attacks in front of them bcuz of stress , they assume that I’m faking. My dad at that moment gets rlly pissed off and then he throws something or mocks me. My mom always thinks that I’m blaming her about my problems but I always tell her it’s not about her and I stress about other things but they’ll never believe that. 

Idk wht im going thru. I just want someone to clear this out form their understanding."
114,Trying to understand myself,"I’ve become indecisive on an unhealthy level.

The past couple of days though, I’ve had zero interest in pursuing that... but I’m starting a business instead. 

It’s honestly making my head spin and I can’t seem to figure out why this is happening or how to just stay out on one thing. Thanks in advance for any help."
115,Probably gets asked all the time but what other ways can I deal with stress or how can I vent / rant in a healthy matter?,"I'm trying to stop venting out to friends since that's toxic and draining for them. Besides, they aren't therapists.

I'm seriously considering deleting all of my social media accounts (i.e. Instagram, Twitter, etc) in order to better my mental health. I feel like certain platforms are driving down my self esteem.

117,I am so stuck in the past,"I tried to kill myself last night. I have never been more disappointed in my life than when I woke up this morning and realised I was still here. I took an overdose because the depression is so bad I can't even get out of bed, and it seemed the easiest option. I can't tell anyone. What could they possibly do? I'm not getting my job back. Or my ex. I spent so long desperatly searching for ""something"", not knowing what, and then I found it. I can't accept that it is gone. That I will never do all the things I used to do. Never see the cities and mountains and the water that I used to. I used to see the world from the air every day. I went to sleep in a different place than the one I woke up in. I met new people constantly, heard new stories. My life has become so small over the past year. I want to go back, and live the moments I was happy again. I close my eyes and I am in his house in the mountains, thousands of miles away from where I am now. It kills me that he is with someone else. It kills me that I will never be cuddled again by him. I hate who I am. I can't see anyway out of this. My few friends I've spoken to say I'm strong, and they're going to push me to be better. I don't want to be pushed, I want to be comforted. I don't want to be on my own any more, i can't take it."
118,What's the point of living if everyday I feel like dying,"I've never posted on reddit but I see people apologising for mobile formatting so sorry if its weird. (Not that I've ever once seen an issue with someone's formatting but hey, maybe mine will be the first) I also apologise for being rambly, possibly incoherent, and probably missing words. Obviously  I'm not in the greatest mindset rn and my brain is not exactly functioning at optimal levels. On to the post..

I've spent New year's eve and New year's day with my best friend, have messages from an amazing girl I've been dating, and yet I'm sitting on my friend's spare bed in tears writing my first ever Reddit post.

I just don't feel any long lasting positive emotion anymore, no matter the circumstances. If I do happen to feel some semblance of hope it is always short-lived. Or excitement about some random interest, it's gone almost as soon as it came and I return to this state of complete and utter apathy. I can never hold onto it nor work up any motivation or interest to pursue it any further.

 Even in relationships, I don't feel connected to anyone in my life, I have people I'm more familiar with and therefore might feel more relaxed around, but I don't feel any connection to them. Even this girl I'm dating. Objectively I can see that she's beautiful, smart, funny, and just a really cool, kind person. But all of that means nothing to me when I can't feel any excitement when she messages or even a desire to talk to her. Messaging her, seeing her.. I'm really not sure I get any enjoyment from it.  It feels more of an obligation, an inconvience, almost a burden.

 I feel as though I could stop talking to almost everyone in my life (which really isn't that many people) and I would feel nothing. I might feel lonely, sad I have no one to be around and do things with, but I'm not sure I would miss anyone specifically. I wouldn't think ""oh I miss (insert person), I miss hanging out with them, joking with them, the way I felt for/with them, etc"" I would just miss the idea of having someone around to do things with, but I already feel that way anyway. Even my best friend, which I feel terrible saying, but these past two days I've just felt frustrated and exhausted and questioned how we even became best friends. I barely recognise myself in my memories.

 I don't see the point of continuing when I'm not sure I'll ever reach a point of mental clarity and stability that would allow me to do anything that makes this life worthwhile.. having friends (and actually feeling like it), a relationship I'm excited about and feel loved in/feel love for them in return, studying, pursuing arts and interests, having a job, moving out, etc, etc, etc.. it all seems so out of reach when I feel like I'm barely surviving each day.

 I also don't understand how people say ""it gets better"" when it never has. It might get better for some time but I always end up back here and recently those good times have been getting shorter and shorter. I just can't handle the feelings of guilt and pain when  I think about the aftermath of my suicide. My mum, my brothers, my best friend, everyone in my life would never be the same and I'm not sure everyone would truly recover from it.  But I also don't know how I'm expected to keep on living. 

I don't even know what I'm expecting from this post. I'm not sure I want to read any replies. I'm just.. at the end here."
119,7 Tips to Manage Stress,"TIPS FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT 

It’s well known that as human beings we encounter various situations, people, places and other things which influence us, and sometimes cause stress. 

Here are seven tips and techniques that are helpful in dealing with stress: 

1.) Slow Down: Being caught up all the time drives one to the edge, leading us to a state of burn out. Slowing down helps one take a moment away from the rush.  

2.) Eat Well: Stress levels escalate when our body does not get its fuel. Hence eating well and eating right is desirable to keep stress at bay. 

3.) Talk yourself through: Trying to understand what is causing stress and what can immediately help you gain your calm, can be helpful. 

4.) Easy Breathing: When we’re stressed, we tend to take shallow breaths. What we need is some deep breaths which expand our lungs.  

5.) Sleep Better: Lack of proper sleep is a key cause of stress. Indulging in some slumber helps keep stress away. 

6.) Take a walk: Taking a walk allows one to enter a different frame of mind which eventually helps to relax the mind.

120,"I suffer with OCD, for which I don’t really tell my family about despite the fact it dictates about 80% of my days. Here’s what my mother said:","We were having a conversation about how rife malingering is in people my age (16-17), as I’ve seen people do it first-handedly, and I knew that they didn’t suffer with anxiety disorders, but they would say that they did and it was always to get something, such as attention or to leave lessons early, lmao. During the conversation she boasted to herself how she’s glad she has such a ‘psychologically well balanced’ daughter. I laughed and told her how that wasn’t necessarily true. She then became irate as she didn’t like the idea that her daughter was mentally ill, what was originally meant to be a compliment to herself and me... I guess, divulged into a full blown argument. As soon as I would bring up my mental health she would huff and puff and make hand-signals for me to get out of the room. I wasn’t being annoying, I had literally said that I spend a lot of my days worrying excessively about things that don’t matter and she was getting so visibly annoyed at the indication. I left the room and ran upstairs and just started bawling in my room. I felt so shunned and unimportant, and as though I don’t fit into what she wants me to be - which feels awful, as I try so hard and get good grades with my mental illness acting as another stressor."
121,Drugs and horny jail?,"I’ve been using ssri and metilphenidate for ocd and adhd over a decade now and had no side effects of anykind so far. Due to an ocd behaviour I start to self harm(ripping flesh) when I get super stressed. I am failing my final year in college so I am super stressed right now. To prevent self harm behaviour I use Trifluoperazine based antipsychotics when I am passing through stressful times. It works perfectly on preventing self harm behavior, however it completely prevents me having an erection. Bad part is, I still have a sexual desire but I can’t relieve myself because I can’t get a boner to masturbate. This stresses me out because I can’t lose the horny in my head and can’t focus completely on my work. 

Normal porn is not working and I need to get rid of the horny. Anyone has experience regarding this subject?"
122,What happened to my brother ? DID ? Wernicke-Korsakoff ? (Long context provided),"First off, yes we have seek medical help in the hospital. However it was 31st Dec when we went to the hospital, and they have scheduled him an appointment with a psychiatrist in the coming Monday. Let's call my brother 'C'.

Meantime, my family and I needs guidance to know how to handle the situation.

TL;DR: My brother changed his nickname from A to B when he was around 8 years old, then B to C when he was around 15 because he found it sounded a lot more unique as B was a common nickname. Just 2 days ago his memory undergone confabulation. Then he said he's not A, B or C anymore, his new identity has no name. C is controlling the body, but the new identity is controlling the emotions. He also mentioned that there is an old guy who he will not name, and is kept locked up by A and B. C will not come out, but will continue to control the body. He keeps saying ""I remember this"" or ""I remember that"" or ""I remember having this conversation"". He's going through my work office documents and he's saying ""Oh I remember this"" when he hasn't even been involved in my work before. He's completely out of his mind, yet calm. He's pointing out random numbers in my work and say ""Oh I remember this phone number"", ""Oh I remember this account number"".

Here's the full context of what happened.

My brother is a 28 y/o who started using weed daily since November. 

On the 29th of Dec, he called me to speak in private at a nearby park. He brought letters from the old house (we left that house about 10 years ago now) that were directed to my parents. During this period he seemed paranoid despite the letters being just normal letters from banks, from the management of the old house, some old bills. He was making up conspiracies about how my dad's a politician and all. Then he told me about an experience he had with weed where he was able to go back to his past memories as a toddler about 1\~2 years old. There he recalled some WILD memories about my parents' relationship and how abusive it was. Now, I am fully aware that my parents were the kind who don't fight in front of us since we were kids I'm 23 and has never recalled any extreme fights let alone shouts from my parents. They still love each other and my dad still occasionally throws pick up lines to my mom. Naturally I kinda let it slide of as one of his ""high"" moments.

On the 30th Dec he was basically in his room the whole time. I assumed he was having another weed session, and never bothered him much. He went out later at night, had some drinks with friends, came home around 5am, and that's when I went to bed too.

On the 31st Dec, I woke up to my parents crying. He had taken a bag from somewhere outside the house off someone's porch, brought it back home and told my dad that the ""game"" don't work on him anymore. He believes my dad punched him at the kitchen and dragged him to the guard house when he was still a kid. But when we moved in to this house he was a 23 year old. He believes my parents wipes his memory every time by ""flashing his memory"" he calls it. He repeatedly says he remembers this happening before. He also said mom dragged him to the room and slapped him to sleep. Now it's covid season, I'm home all day. What the hell is he talking about? He has accused my parents of abusing him which never happened. My parents were hurt, they thought he cracked under stress and has gone mental (to which I kinda agree he's psychotic now as well). He keeps saying ""he remembers \*insert whatever is happening at the moment\*"" and said he has done this many times now. He also casually mentioned something about his helmet colliding with his friend's on a bike while he was doing a wheelie. I thought okay that must be it. He had a concussion or a brain injury. So we rushed him to the hospital to get an MRI scan. As we were leaving the house we see a carpenter walking around the place and asked us if we have seen his bag. The bag my brother brought home was this carpenter's bag indeed. At the hospital, the MRI scan shows nothing wrong with him. Urine and blood tests for common drugs (including alcohol) also said he's clean despite him and I doing weed together frequently. However, he too has admit to the doctor that he did weed and so that was added to the remark section. The doctor said he responded to questions well and he seemed sane, but then recommended him to a psychiatrist and immediately sent him there. Since it was new years the psychiatrist scheduled him an appointment on Monday, and prescribed medications for him mean time. Through it all he keeps saying he remembers being at the psychiatric ward before, and even says he remembers the guy who brings him to weigh himself, despite having to register himself as a new patient.

Today was a rollercoaster ride. My parents spoke to him, showered love and support, and he eventually broke down crying. But that fixed nothing. He keeps saying he forgives my mom for the things she has done to him in the past (she don't know WHAT). He still tells us he remembers all these things that aren't even true. He keeps creating fake memories. Just about an hour ago he said ""Now if you ask me if I would like to kill, I would say no. I have several times taken the knife and stand over the bed. I won't let that happen anymore, but keep staying up late until C comes back"". So here I am, staying awake, to let my parents sleep. As I'm typing this his personality has changed. I am asking him questions about who he is. He says he is C now. He explained that he told the unnamed identity to look for information. He sounds like himself now, but says he will build another identity to take over. I don't know what to do. Please help. Any advice on how we can control him. He has spit out his meds, and I wouldn't want to provoke any aggressive response. I am trying to speak to him about his other identities and I don't know if it's healthy to play along or slap him out of it."
123,I need some motivation,This new year feels the same like any other year. It doesn’t feel special as it used to. All days feel the same and feel so tiring. Living is tiring. I do want to do some self improvements like working out. The worst feeling is I want to work out but not put the effort into it. I am so miserable that my body is keeping me stuck in bed. Any motivation helps
124,Can’t tell if my mom is the reason I’m more anxious and emotionally sensitive,"I think about this sometimes and wonder if I’m crazy. I can’t remember a lot of the things that led up to how I am now because my memory is bad..

I have a feeling it’s a lot of her getting mad at me for little things in the past (leaving deodorant in a bathroom 2 feet away from her, or checking my phone in the morning, shit, she got mad at me for not sightseeing Colorado because I wanted to stay with my grandma after she had medical issues the night before), denying my anxiety when I tell her she causes it, not really apologizing for when she upsets me or makes me cry, making me feel like I had to fake my emotions and what I said for my short term therapy (told me not to say the wrong things, not look too sad when I went, made mental hospitals sound like a nightmare), and even saying I should be grateful after I was honest and told her I was scared of her. Oh yeah, she likes to blame my phone/PS4, even my friends for me being disrespectful or for my grades being messed up, when really she thinks to blame her parenting. I mean, when I’m scared I get defensive since she takes things out of proportion. She doesn’t even know my friends either, I don’t like her knowing my friends, and they’re all good people so she’s wrong on that.

And this is just a small list of how I notice I feel around her as a result of everything (even the things I couldn’t name):

- scared to ask for some things or hang out with friends, etc 
- scared of her getting mad at me 
- getting easily startled sometimes even when I’m not doing anything wrong 
- occasional nightmares that cause me to wake up with extremely bad anxiety 
- i don’t trust her with my issues or my problems 
- i feel safe when i’m away from her 
- i don’t like going places alone with her 

I dunno. One of my friends said she was emotionally abusive but I don’t want to call something abuse that really isn’t. Anyway, just wanted to let that out cause I was thinking about it."
125,Trouble sleeping?,"Hey y'all, I was wondering if someone could help me out here. No matter what my sleep schedule looks like (sleeping at normal hours, or almost no sleep schedule) it's like maybe a quarter of my brain is asleep all day; I'm clumsy, foggy, lightly disoriented, quite distracted, and have a lot more problems come up with ADHD, Dyslexia, and Working Memory Issues, and my whole body aches. But then at around 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. I'm WIRED, like fully awake, my body doesn't ache, it feels like I'm running at my best levels, and now it's reaching a point where I'm having trouble falling asleep because I know I'm going to miss that wave where I feel good and never get it back when everything else is going so horribly. I don't really know what my question is, just maybe like what's going on with my brain? Any advice? Experiences?"
126,I posted a message encouraging everybody to be happier and stronger in the new year and nobody gave a damn.,"I get that there’s all sorts of reasons for people to ignore me. But at this rate I just can’t deal with the bs anymore. I tried to be positive and encouraging even in a situation where it’s hard for me to, I’m completely alone, estranged and dealing with a load of issues. and yet I can’t even get somebody to give a damn. Bye everyone. Wish you the best of luck in everything."
127,[TW Child Abuse/Pedophilia] Do my dreams represent fears/forgotten memories ? Do I need to see a psychologist/psychiatrist for this ?,"**Big trigger warning for mentions of child abuse and possible pedophilia. Please be careful if you decide to read my post.**

I'm not a native English speaker so there will probably be language errors. There is also a TLDR at the end of the post.

I've been disrespected by other Redditors when I asked for support in the past, so I will report and block anyone who comes here with the intention to mock me or call me a karma wh\*re. ***This account is a throwaway, I am asking for support, not judgement.***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For starters, I'm an 18yo AFAB person. In terms of mental health, I have depression, and possibly ADHD (self-diagnosed for now, hopefully waiting for a professional diagnosis). With lockdown, I had to go back to my parents' house ; the long period of time I spent with my parents really let me rethink my relationship with them, and I realized a lot of things.

First, they have a very bad habit of gaslighting. I'm short-tempered and globally hypersensitive in terms of emotions, and I never received any support for that from them. It's always the ""get over it, you don't have any reason to be upset"" treatment. Because of this overall abusive background, I do not remember a lot until around 13yo.

Secondly, I have two different relationships with my mother and my father when it comes to the rocky side. I regurlarly fight with my mother because I see her as an equal, not as a superior in terms of family hierarchy. *Disclaimer : I do not condone the concept of parents/elders being considered as superior to children and teenagers at all* ; sadly it's how it works in my family. As for my father, it's completely different, since I've realised that I fear him ; for example, I cower when he yells, but not when my mom yells.

This is where it becomes really, really uncomfortable. Not only did I realise that I fear my dad, when I can confront other adults without trembling, but I also remembered feelings that felt really, really weird when I first experienced them. To make it short, I hate it when my dad touches me anywhere. He especially had a bad habit of putting his hand on my shoulder or thigh (not too up on the thigh but the contact itself feels just yucky), and give me small slaps on the rear when he's jokingly asking me to move out of the way. I bore with it for a long time, and tried to assess my physical boundaries since a year or two ago. He practically stopped all of those, but there have been problems with me remembering this because I'm comfortable with my boyfriend touching me like this, but it makes me think of my dad sometimes so it's absolutely horrible and I don't know how to stop associating a feeling with a person.

The last problem is my dreams. I've always had weird dreams, but some of them really fucked me up. **BEGINNING OF TRIGGERING PART.** &gt;!These dreams were about sex, but not as in ""wet dream"", more like a dream where I'm about to have sex with someone I know but shouldn't be having sex with. I never do it, but it's always super close to doing it and when I wake up I feel really uncomfortable. First one was with a boarding school-mate, I woke up just before it happening. Second dream was with someone I knew from highschool, and it was even weirder since they said ""I know you don't want this"" and then walked away. Third and last dream was with my dad. There was a party at my house, and the ""me"" in the dream treated him like a one-night date. I woke up feeling nauseous when I understood what was going to happen. !&lt;**END OF TRIGGERING PART.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What do these dreams mean ? May I have forgotten anything about my childhood that would be resurfacing now ? Would seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist help me with this ?

*TLDR : I have a rocky relationship with both my parents, but only truly fear my father. My dad used to cross my boundaries (which I have now almost reassessed), and I recently remembered dreams where I'm about to have sex but wake up before it happens ; one of these dreams include my father, but they are all equally uncomfortable.*"
128,My (18M) poor mental health during my teenage years caused me to become so resentful of all of my family as a teenager and have gotten so distant and I no longer know how to have a relationship with anyone in my family and don't know how to change how I view them but just feel uncontrollably angry.,"Sorry if this is a ramble but when I was around 13 or 14 I started fighting with my parents a lot. I know basically everyone goes through disagreements with their parents but at one point I started to really hate them and resent them and now I don't know how to undo it. I also was diagnosed with depression and Aspergers at 13 and social anxiety too at 16 which caused me to argue with them a lot. I have actually tried three medications for depression and anxiety and none have worked and decided I didn't want to try another one. I basically stopped spending time with them when I was around 15. Whenever they would go out I would refuse to and I stopped hanging around downstairs until I essentially stopped speaking to them. I didn't have a great relationship with them before but it wasn't too bad and we would tend to speak everyday. From 13-18 I hardly spoke to them unless it was an argument. I remember once or twice going out for meals and feeling really awkward and hated spending any time with them. I remember the last time I saw a movie with my dad I felt so awkward being the same room as him I kept closing my eyes and not wanting to watch the film.

Now, the only time I see either of them is at meal times (where we don't tend to eat together but 2 out of 3 meals I might be in the same room as them) and whenever I see them I feel so uncomfortable and awkward around them I can barely speak to them and never look them in the eye. Every time they do something it makes me get really angry and I feel like I want to smash something but I just get so anxious about having a bad interaction and focusing on it so much afterwards that will ruin my day and make me depressed so I hardly engage in conversation about them.

There's nothing really wrong with my parents. I wouldn't say they're amazing parents or had a good example because they don't really have relationships with their parents but I don't think they're terrible people, I just feel so angry towards them and I don't know why. I wish I could shake this feeling and having a normal relationship with them but I can't stop feeling so angry towards them. I think they would probably want to have a relationship with me but I can't stand talking to them. I hate the way they talk when I hear them speak to each other and I just don't know how to feel comfortable being myself around them because everything they say makes me feel really awkward. I would say from 15 to now the only times I have spoken to my parents is when I've had breakdowns or because of school stuff. That also makes me feel awkward because I feel humiliated when I've had breakdowns in front of my parents and my brother and don't know how they view me and it really scares me. The only times I would tend to talk to them was when they school contacted them when I told someone I wanted to kill myself. I did okay at school academically but had trouble making friends and always had problems with depression which made me not want to speak to anyone. I would sometimes go weeks without properly talking to anyone in my family and now I can't imagine even feeling able to talk to them about anything and I don't know how to get the confidence to change it. I have never been great with friendships and find it hard to open up to people and now I recoil in horror at the thought of opening up to my parents and feel like I could never do it. In all of 2020 I think I spoke to my parents on no more than 20 occasions. My parents have always been very gossipy and so has our entire family and I hate the idea of my parents talking about me that way. I know I should probably try to have a relationship with my family but I don't know how to get the confidence to do so. I feel unable to do anything because of my lack of self confidence and self hatred.

I have a younger brother who is 11 and I have essentially ignored him since he was 6 or 7. I have tried to have a relationship with him from his birth to then and we sometimes got on but stopped getting on when I was around 12 and he was 5. However I always found it hard to connect with him and I feel like it was my problem. I always felt resentful of him since he was born and felt like I was less of a person when he was born though I don't know why. I have played guitar since I was 8 years old and felt like sometimes that was the only thing I could identify with, and now my brother is learning guitar it makes me so angry and I feel threatened even though I know it's wrong and I shouldn't feel that way and I can't stop him and won't but I feel so angry and like he's trying to take something away from me even though I know I'm being an asshole. I don't know how to change the way I view my family. I don't know what my brother thinks of me anymore and I don't know if he'd let me in but I feel like I wouldn't know how to have a relationship with him and feel really scared to try. I don't think I've spoken to my brother since 2017 or 2018 and I don't know how to. I feel so resentful to him and have had lots of times in the past where I have fantasised about killing him even though I never would, I still feel so angry that exists and sometimes hate him for it and wish he wasn't born even though I have no real reason to and I know I shouldn't and that makes me a bad person.

I have just returned from uni where I lived from September to December. I found it quite difficult. I didn't make many friends because of COVID and have not been enjoying my course and would rather do something musical but find it hard to do anything sometimes. I have been dealing with a really poor mental health phase for quite a few years and it's definitely gotten worse due to the pandemic and lockdown and at university. I thought some time away would help but I hardly ever talked on the phone with them when I was there. I returned home on two occasions when I had breakdowns and we talked a little bit then but since coming back for Christmas I find that I'm spending all my time in my room like before and never speaking to them or my brother. I tend to spend all my time in my room listening to music or playing guitar and when they've gone to bed I sometimes smoke weed which I started doing at 17 but I know it is harmful but I am finding it hard to stop. I think the last time I was in the same car as all my family was when I was 16. My dad would occasionally drive me places but we would never talk.

I wish I could quit university and move out completely but I don't have a job and don't know much about being an adult and where to start but feel so distant from my entire family and I really do not know what to do and sometimes feel like I am barely a functioning human and don't know what to do or what to try."
129,what's happening to me?,"I used to be like, constantly happy. people would admire me for always seeing a positive side to things, and it seems like my brain had a virtually infinite supply of dopamine and serotonin or whatever makes you happy. every topic would interest me after a while, every activity excite me. I was aware that things aren't perfect right now, but the future always seemed like a place full of opportunities that i'm looking forward to.

now i'm suddenly like a grey turd. everything feels tedious, nothing is fun anymore, i either cry or sleep or make disgusting small talk for the benefit or other people. not even jerking off gets me excited anymore even if i do have any libido left at the end of the day. the future is a big dark slab of annoyance that i've got to get through to keep other people from being sad somehow. i wish i could just let myself sink to the bottom of the ocean and never see or hear anything again.

 i constantly have tremors in my hands and legs and am like twice as weak as i used to be. all the hills i used to be able to cycle up without problems, i can now barely push my bike up, despite eating and drinking and exercising as much as usual.

there's this annoyingly intense craving i constantly feel, like my chest is itching with the absence of something i REALLY need, but i have no idea what it is that i'm craving. human affection? attention? i tried to see whether tinder would help but i really just get annoyed at my matches and after a while i get too anxious to open the app, so i guess human attention wasn't it. 

i have NO IDEA why i'm suddenly like  this, my year wasn't even half bad, neither is my life, i still get to see friends fairly often despite covid, i live with a lot of family, my future is looking somewhat bright. the only thing that's endangering all of this is my own lack of motivation.

help. what is this and how do i make it stop"
130,I'm scared that I'm making an excuse,"Hey! This post is going to be a slightly long one!

I graduated last year and my life has been quite a roller coaster since then. I'm working at a crappy startup and I live with my parents; I'm receiving a lot of pressure from them to get my life together.

In pursuit of a better life, I've been studying for grad school exams and the experience is so daunting. 
I was studying really hard, many hours a day with complete focus. I wasn't meeting friends, wasn't watching Netflix, I  completely cut myself off from any sort of relaxation. 
Suddenly, in November some switch went off in my brain and my motivation is now 0. I tried various ways to motivate myself but it seems so hard. Although I'm scared and nervous about it, I just cannot study anymore.

My exam is next week and I've not studied in the past one month. I am unable to bring myself to do it no matter how hard I try.
I don't feel like myself anymore I usually study for every test, no matter how small but now when it's such a crucial one I'm ceasing to care. 

I'm not sure if all this is because I'm not ready for this yet and am doing all this under pressure, or because I'm not cut out for this but I really want this end. I'm anxious and sad all day. I'm neither studying nor doing something fun....I'm just stressing all day long.


I want to know if I postpone my plans to next year, am I making an excuse for being lazy or is it okay?"

133,"Feeling terrified, frequent panic after losing a family member","About me in brief: I am a young female (24 years old). I lost my grandpa in the summer of '20, he was the second family member I lost (my grandma died 4 years ago). Now we had to sell their flat, their stuff... So somehow last summer impacted my mood more deeply than the one 4 years ago, because I realized they are both gone now...   


Since then, I get these scary thoughts about losing my parents, my boyfriend or other loved ones. I start to panic and feel really low afterwards. (for example: I start to cry, get death anxiety - I even feel like I will die soon and have just overall an intense, unexplained fear) I know that death is the part of our existence, I knew this fact before as well but I always was able to accept it, move on and not think about it again. But for a few months I have these thoughts every single day, I am (almost) never calm...   


I never was like this. Is this normal after a loss, will this terrible feeling/horrible thoughts ever go away or should I seek professional help?   


Many thanks in advance and wishing you a happy new year!"
134,I can’t trust people. People are fake.,"I don’t know why but I’ve become someone who cannot trust people anymore. I always feel like everyone is going to end up hurting me. I don’t value friendships because I think they are not gonna last so why should I bother wasting time/my feelings on them. I always distant myself from everyone. I don’t hangout with my classmates because I just don’t see the point to it. It’s not like I’m gonna see them after school is over. I can’t even call anyone “my friend”, I refer to them as acquaintances. For instance, an acquaintance of mine made plans to hangout with me but I am not even looking forward to it because I feel like that person is also fake and soon, we’re gonna lose touch anyway so I don’t see the point of wasting my whole day with them. Of course I didn’t turn them down because I can’t say no to people but I feel like a horrible person for feeling this way about them. Don’t get me wrong, I believe I’m nice to people and I do talk to my classmates when we’re in class but that’s about it for me. I don’t like hanging out with them outside of school. I would just rather be alone and do my own thing."
135,I really can’t be okay for too long can I ?,"A month ago I was doing SO good. Acing all my tests, understanding all my classes, talking naturally with people while being fully sober and having ZERO anxiety about it. I finished my art project, cleaned my room, poured all the alcohol I owned down the sink, I reconnected with old classmates. I was genuinely happy. 

And now I’m sitting in my room, with a pile of undone homework I have to hand on Monday, trying to find the motivation to pick up my books and study for my upcoming exams. While everyone else is celebrating."
136,Hello 2021 🙄😣,"Today I posted a question asking for ideas on how to make money after my business collapsed in the middle of the pandemic and left me utterly broke.

The volume of hate I received over that one question.

“Your being too lazy to work any job, you think your better”
“People like you don’t deserve help”
“If you can run a business you can work for Uber eats or deliveroo”

Safe to say I spent the next hour seriously questioning if this is the world we live in. Somebody is struggling and reaches out for help and is made to feel so worthless 😣"
137,I feel paranoid and hear whispers...,"(I've already posted this on the mental-health site, but I'd like more opinions)

Hey Reddit!

I want to ask about something serious, so I hope that this is the right place to do so.

Btw, this is a throwaway account...I want to be sure that no-one I know in real life will read this, hence why I use this anonymous account.

Anyway...I've been dealing with depressive thoughts (don't want to say depression, because I have never got diagnosed) and selfharm..this has been going on for the last four years...I tend to isolate myself a lot, and I don't really have any friends, so I spend a lot of time on my own..This doesn't bother me that much, because I'd rather be alone most of the time, but I do get lonely sometimes..

Lately I've been experiencing weird things..I've been feeling very paranoid, and whenever I'm in public I fear that people are watching me and talking about me behind my back and plotting something against me. I've also checked my room for cameras and microphones, because I feel like someone has put surveillance in my room to spy on me. I've seen a few black shadows as well...Last night I saw a black silhouette with glowing red eyes and it freaked me out...this was at like 2 am at night so I went straight to sleep afterwards. Sometimes I hear whispers, especially at night. I can't really make out what they are saying, it's kind of like a radio or TV that is on, but in another room. I accused my brothers of talking with their friends at night, but they were both asleep and told me that it could not have been them talking...I also keep checking my curtains because I have this weird feeling that someone is standing outside my window looking at me. I have really weird thoughts about aliens or the government having planted a microchip in my mind so that they can control my thoughts...this is really scary and it's creeping me out...I haven't talked with anyone about it, because they'll probably think I'm crazy...I try to reassure myself that this can't be real, but on the other side it seems so real.

Has anyone ever experienced this?

TL:DR: I have weird thoughts of being watched, and I see and hear things that others don't."
138,[Psychological] I need help to know what should I do with my mind.,"

I am not the best at writing a long text or making comprehensive text so I will write what I feel and a bit of cobtext snd idk 



I feel happy and after realizing I am happy I suddenly feel horrible and uncomfortable and nervous and anxious.

I feel like i dont deserve happiness and at the same time, me being happy is laughable to other and that makes me anxious.

I usually think about my family becoming older and it makes me want to die so they could stay young in my imagination.

I want to die when I think about my family looking at me. I never had a good relationship with them but I know they are good people and I like when they are happy with or without me. Thats why I dont want them dead.

Wanting to die is not suicide but to stop existing.
Not the same at all.

I can control my own emotion by doing some actions and thinking things that makes me feel hsppy or angry or sad or whatever.

However being sad or depressed? (Idk if I am) gives me 0 motivation to feel happy or other.

I can make my mind into a way that makes me think nothing. Like meditating or smth idk.

I feel like I am not real and my emotions are just part of the enviroment and part of how is my day.

My way of talking changes when hearing other talking in a specific way. If they talk in a heavy russian english I sometimes respond in their accent .

I can talk in English Japanese Italian and Spanish all perfectly and always think in my kind with all of them (not at the same time but depending on the moment)

I speak with native accent in Jap Spa and Ita since I learned the language by talking lr hearing but not english since I learnt by reading and listening only so I have bad accent and all.

I think this above can be related since I am too good at imitating (not voice or emotions, but actions and thinking or speaking.)

I can know how is the personality of the other person talking to me just by looking at his or her movement, face ,smile and the way of talking (kinda instant)

I imitate others way of talking unintentionally.

If the person who is talking to me is emotional I use to imitate that emotion or show the reversed (if angry then I am sad, If they are sad then I am sad but If they are happy I feel sad and etc )

I think I am capable of knowing the REAL opinon of someone by looking at reactions and I think I am realist but somehow I always end up looking all negatively but at the same time I think I am not negative but realist.

I am pretty normal, no problem with communicating with others but somehow I am different when talking to people or working or playing games.

I can immerse to story easily and have a great imagination. 

I immerse easily to music and change emotion Quickly and easily by music type.

I sometimes stutter (not too much, but because I talk too fast) 

I think way too much and I use to speak faster cause I need to talk more before I go to the next step where Words coming from mouth isnt enough speed.

I think I am kinda intelligent and in a way cursed by knowing too much about emotion and about peoples mind. 

I am not narcissistic mostlikely cause I hate my self. 

I even have toughts of if being stupid might have made me happy or smth but I think knowledge is the most valuable thing.

I seriously need help in a way I dont know.

I live alond and live in Japan 19yo woking and studying. Parents divorced at 4 or 5 yo.
My mother took me in Japan at that time without anyone permission not even mine and stood there for 6 or 7 year 
Then 1 year to Italy then lived 6 to 7 in Spain.

Changed school around 20 times so I gave up on making friends with distance (I have internet friends and also a really good friend in spain who is my best friend and we still talk alot and play games Online.) 

Travlled between Japan and Italy like 100 times between those years I mentioned above.
My Father is a heavysmoker with a raging character but is very charismatic if calm and not nervous and 
Very intelligent but if not calm and nervous he looks like hsving serious issue of stress. A very hars worker and respected in many ways.

Ny Mother was alcoholic and used to work hard when we were living 2 alone, she is Japanese, but She drank alot and was very angry and very furious at midnight to morning. I actuslly feel horible for her to even live like that for like 6 years. Divorced with a son and living onto the edge plus the stress problems. 

Both of them are now married happy and stable.

They started to be happy when I wasnt there. 

Why do I live 

Why Am I alive

Why did i get born
 

I became sensitive to stress and act like a caretaker when seeing others stressed 

Some calls.me.a good person but i am just a coward who know how to think.

I need help. Dont know what to do 

More I think more crazy it gets.

More I think More sad I am.



By the time I sleep and I wake up. It resets. Every emotion. Is like if I am going to die by sleeping and then revived at morning.

I wish one day I would sleep and never wake up.

I want to be happy. 

Btw am not crying oe being crazy. I feel calm but scared since I am going to sleep. And die and then revive new.

I have nothing to talk wirh thinks like this.

Another thing.  

I know this sounds like a teenager word but 

I am.more mature than othes, by far.
Watched 2 friends dying when i was 15 and lived to much for being 19.

Lived a life where all the bad things happened maybe the rest is of happiness but I think I will die before that point.

I am maybe melodramatix but its for expressing my self clear and also I see other 20yo snd I envy them. I cant be the same as anyone under 30 or 40.
I see some 45yo or 60yo have same look of me emotionally and recognize them. 

Once I met a guy who told me he was 24 but he had the same look of me in 2020. After we talked together all the bad things the world could make to us (basicallt talked about our terror) we made our self friends but week later he suicided and left me a sms which said that 
He was going to recover from depression if we talked along

And I felt it so hard. I didnt want this emotion to ve cured. This is my only emotion where I actually feel something by my self.







Btw.
 what do I get by gettind diagnosed of mental illness.

And As I said before. From outside I am a normal kid with good actitude and a good person (thsts what i think by seeing other reactions and some ssid to me thsh to ) dont judge me on this part. 
Thats just the appearance anyway."
139,Reduced dose of risperidone causing palpitations?,"Hi, I'm on a phone so excuse the formatting.

I've been on risperidone (atypical antipsychotic) for two years, and have reduced over time from 4mg to 0.5mg and have over the past two months or so had heart palpitations almost every day.

It doesn't seem to be linked to anxiety since I don't have any other anxiety symptoms but I'm just a bit worried that this could get worse when I stop medication next month.

I've also recently stopped taking procycledine which I was taking for the side effects of risperidone (stiffness, slurred speech, tremors)

I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced similar?
Thanks"

141,Thank you for this subreddit that made this documentary possible!,"A couple of weeks back, I posted on this subreddit that I was making a documentary on Mental Illness during covid-19 by creating an anonymous form. 

Entering 2021, I hope to let this piece bring hope for the people. Even though 2020 was one of the most challenging years. 2020 was a year of self-growth, appreciation for the world, and most importantly a year of reflection.  Covid-19 and functioning in a world during a pandemic was a long battle and still a continuous one! To be truthful, nobody has the answers on what the future is going to be like. But life is worth living and let this be a success story in your life.

142,It's hard to even describe what I'm feeling right now,"I've felt so detached for the last few days. I'm at a really devastating low, and nothing feels real. I just drank a bunch of alcohol hoping that maybe it would numb me but I'm sitting on the floor right now crying my eyes out. I feel like a horrible person - how my mental issues ruined my last relationship, how I avoid everything because it all feels overwhelming, how unstable I am. I feel useless and horrible. Everyday passes just like every other, and every day is the same because I accomplish nothing. I'm overwhelmed and detached and nothing makes sense [anymore.It](https://anymore.It)"
143,Idk whether this is normal or not but every time I wake up from sleep I feel the following,"1. Shit scared of something that doesn’t exist. In simple words, I don’t know what I’m scared of but it’s so damn scary that I tremble so badly because of which my bed shakes. 

2. I feel so cold even after sleeping in a hoodie and quilt. 

3. I’m seeing dead people in my dreams for the past two months. Firstly I saw a dead woman in a street near my house, then I saw a famous YouTuber die, after that, I saw myself jumping off a building and at last today I saw a baby die. 

Adding to this from the past nine months I’m experiencing extreme loneliness and sadness (I can’t say depression cause I didn’t go to a psychologist but this sadness has been persistent for the past nine months). I’m not able to concentrate even for a bit and I haven’t laughed in months adding to this I’ve been having really serious suicidal thoughts and two months ago I started to self-harm."

145,How do you help someone from a distance,"My friend has very aggressive and angry and mean parents and I don’t know how to help her. She text me that she’s crying everyday and her father is screaming at her to kill herself, and i just don’t know what to tell her. I keep saying that I’m sorry and that I love her but that’s of course not enough. What else can i do?"
146,Mental health and pregnancy,"When I was 12 I had a lot of pain in my legs and head. When I was 14 I was finally diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Soon after I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. A year later diagnosed with BPD. Then chronic migraines. Around 17 diagnosed with a seizure disorder. A year ago diagnosed with alopecia. 6 months ago diagnosed with herpes. And just recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. Because of all my problems I take medication. 5 different pills in the morning and 3 different pills at night. I’ve always wanted children eventually (I’m 22). But it seems like my list for health problems keeps piling up. If I have a child they will most likely inherit some of my health problems and my fiancé has BPD, depression, anxiety and ADHD. So between us both our child will come out with some problems. I’ve been contemplating on getting my tubes tied. I don’t believe in abortion (if you’re reading this and you do, then you do you). And I wouldn’t want the child to be put up for adoption because I was adopted. But I feel like it’s kind of cruel to put my child through the pain I went through knowing they will most likely go through. And then there’s the part where I can’t be off my meds because if I am then I would be putting myself and the child in danger but if I am on my meds then the child could come out with even more problems. So that is why I am thinking about getting my tubes tied. I was just wondering what others think."
147,Really doing bad,"My now ex boyfriend broke up with me 3 days ago and I'm doing so bad. I've slept for 4 hours total in the last three nights and can't eat.

This has 100% been the worst 3 weeks of my life and haven't been able to get out of bed, lost all feelings in general that's why he broke up with me and all I want is for him to come back.

For context my friend is female and she is a minor.

A few days ago I had to talk her out of suicide.  She has mentioned that she had wanted to kill herself before but I had never thought she would have actually went through with it. She also cut herself a bit but I stopped her before she could do too much harm. 

While I was on the phone with her she kept saying that she really wants to see me.  I have wanted to end our friendship way before but I failed. 

She has had lots of anger issues from the time I meet her. She is also is really dependent.

I was recently scrolling on tiktok and I found a video of someone talking about BPD.  I had heard about it before but it only recently clicked. 

I’m pretty sure she has it but I wanna see some other peoples thoughts first."

155,Telling employer or other person of higher authority about my anxiety,"Is it weird to tell a boss or other person of higher authority about your mental health struggles?
Backstory: I volunteered to do a telemarketing thing where I have to cold call people thinking it would help me get over my phone anxiety/phobia (shocker, it didn’t!). I feel super guilty bc I barely made any calls (I was supposed to make hundreds). I plan to email the person in charge and apologize but is it worth mentioning the reason and explaining my anxiety or should I just apologize and not include why I didn’t make the calls?"
156,new year’s encouragement - you’ve got this !!,"with 2021 just beginning, we’ll inevitably be hearing a lot of new year’s resolutions (wanting to lose weight, be happier, cut out toxic people, etc). i’m here to remind you all that you don’t need to put insane pressure on yourself to be a “new and improved” person in 2021. i think it can be good and healthy to potentially have a bit more motivation than usual at the beginning of the year to make some life changes, but don’t be discouraged if you’re having a rough time and aren’t making huge strides in your life right now. everyone moves through life at their own pace and it’s perfectly okay to not make new year’s resolutions. it’s also okay to make new year’s resolutions and then not end up sticking to them 

let’s get through this year together!

158,Are there any apps out there that have you’ve found useful for depression and anxiety?,I’ve tried Calm and that doesn’t seem to help. Any resource would be useful. Thanks.
159,Does anyone know the name for this?,"I made this throwaway to ask this question. Does anybody know the name of this behavior I am having? Every day, multiple times a day if I remember something mildly embarrassing, mess up during the day, or sometimes there is no exo/endogenous stimulus to cause this, I will get a visceral, very strong negative physical response along with the thought “KILL YOURSELF”. Sometimes it’s just a moment and it will pass, other times it repeats over and over and over again for up to an hour. I’ll try listening to music or distract myself with my phone or something when they’re longer bouts, but often that doesn’t work, or I just have to keep distracting myself because the minute I put my phone down it’ll come back. 

When it does happen, whatever I’m in the middle of doing often my body will reflexively stop. For instance, if I am cooking or watching television, when it hits I’ll put down my knife immediately and just walk away for a millisecond or I’ll turn off the TV without thinking about it. 

My friend mentioned something called intrusive thoughts and I figured it might be that, but when I looked it up it seemed to be disturbing sexual or violent thoughts towards others. I have never experienced that before, so I am unsure if this would be considered intrusive thoughts. 

If you know what the term for this is, or have an idea what it might be, please let me know. It’s a very exhausting part of my day and I would like to understand it, so I might be able to lower the frequency of this happening. I suffer from anxiety and depression, if that helps. 

Thank you!"
160,Needed help with modifying rules &amp; assumptions in CBT self-therapy,"So...I'm doing a worksheet on Modifying Rules and Assumptions and I found myself get stuck on how I could modify my rule and assumption about relationships, particularly friendships, and I would appreciate some opinions or ideas on how could I make it more flexible and appropriate for me because I still need parts of the rule to not fall back into one-sided relationships and being a push-over but that rule also pushes people away. 

***My rule is:*** I can't keep friendships so I will never try to make any friends.

***Because:*** In the past, I was left behind by my best friends on multiple occasions and I was the one to put more effort into the friendships than the other person. I then decided to not have friends at all but then I let someone in and the story happened again so it changed into ""I will not show that I want to put effort and care about our relationship""

**This affects me now by:** When I put effort into any relationship, I feel divided and insecure; I feel like I should not reach out because I am making myself vulnerable again and the story will circle back but I want to have a nice conversation and connect with people, and when I do reach out and person in not highly enthusiastic, I feel like I made a mistake and now I look clingy or desperate in that person's eyes; This makes me only talk to people if they initiate the conversation.

I want to still keep the **advantages** of not wasting time on people that are not really interested in me, not acting like a clingy servant, and let go of people that are not putting enough effort into a relationship. But I want to drop **disadvantages** like giving an impression of being distant/unavailable by trying not to show that I care about the relationship because I might make the relationship one-sided but this time where I don't put the effort into it and the other person does most of the work.

So the question is: What are the alternatives to this rule that would make it more flexible or would reduce the disadvantages? 

I'm thinking about doing something like if I initiate conversation 3 times in a row to a person, 4th time will be theirs to initiate and if they don't I just kinda ""forget"" about them. Is that a good plan? Is it fair? Are there any other ideas of rules I can use?"
161,So sad today,"I have been just weeping all day. I feel like I’m grieving before any deaths. I do not feel understood, and so I isolate. I know it’s wrong, I know the psychology. I know techniques etc, but I get so angry and I just want to FEEL sad. I’m just sad and I want to be understood for being so sad, and not tried to be fixed."
162,I really just want to know if anyone can relate to this at all? i’m not sure if i am just trying to get attention or am just messed up or what is even going on.,"I heard about a mental illness on tiktok one day about 6 months ago. It pretty much destroyed my life from there. My first thought was “Hmm.. that sounds very similar to me.” then I started researching it. More tiktok’s about it would come up every time i opened the app. it got to the point where I would think to myself “I have it.” 

I don’t want to have it. Maybe I do? Despite the fact that I know how horrific it is, and it is probably the most painful mental illness out there. I Act like I want to have it. There would be situations where I would think to myself as I did something “This is a symptom of that illness”. That only made me do it more. As if I wanted to have it. I continued to act as the symptoms of the illness even though I didn’t want to.

It always made bad things happen. I hated it. I kept doing it. It feels like I have no control and that I have to watch myself act this way, though I don’t enjoy doing it. I have never told anyone this because it makes no sense and I have no idea how to explain it. This has taken over my life.

It comes and goes in waves. For months at a time I will think about this illness within everything that I say, just because “I may have it.” I knew I had obsessive thoughts but this has just been ridiculous. This has caused me so much pain almost everyday. I feel as if i’m acting out for attention and to show symptoms of this illness on purpose. But why? I don’t want to have it. Why do I do it?"

I'm struggling with my last exam, I already postponed my uni degree three times because of it. I kinda struggled for the last three years, and this last one was pretty rough. I feel like I'm only a burden to my parents, and I'm giving them nothing but worries. Like, I'm not making their life better at all, I often think that they'd better if I just disappeared.
 I'd really like to be 20 years younger so I could go there and ask them a big hug, but we aren't exactly a warm-hearted family, and I don't have any form of ""emotional intimacy"" with them, so I can't really ask for a hug at the age of 26 y.o.. I also don't want them to know I'm feeling miserable. (I mean, they're not bad parents, I like them, they're ok).

I'm feeling very useless, stupid and lonely.

166,Why hormones are so incredibly important for mental health.,"In our early twenties energy, mood and health are generally at their peak. This is primarily due to our hormones getting stable (after the pubertal biochemical roller-coaster) and reaching their peak levels and balance.

As hormones levels ebb by our late twenties,  so often does our enthusiasm and zest for life. Our energy, mood and  motivation starts to wane. However, it happens too slowly for most of us  to be aware. We no longer feeling the same way as in our early  twenties.

The most efficient, most effective and healthiest way to get your  energy, health and life back is restoring your hormones to where they  were. Believe it or not - if done properly and appropriately, hormone replacement is a safe intervention.

I argue that hormones contribute around two thirds to our overall energy  levels. Many of the lifestyle choices we make (e.g. diet, exercise,  sleep) exert a substantial part of their effects via the endocrine  system.

Hormones affect *everything.*  From energy, mood, looks, motivation, sleep, metabolism, cognition and every other facet of our physiology.

It's likely that your hormones are sub-optimal. Please go check them. I consider hormones optimal if they are around the 75th percentile (of a youthful reference range!)"

I feel like crap because a month has passed and I only wrote 500 more words on an essay that needs to be 3000 words. My prof told me once it goes past Jan 4th then he doesn’t have control anymore and I’ll need to ask for permission from the department head. At this point I feel like a failure but I asked anyways, because I think I will fail the course if I don’t. I know the whole “your mental illness doesn’t define you” and like “oh you aren’t a failure” talk but I feel like a piece of crap. I am so so stressed.

169,Bit scared by my mood swings,"This is just a rant, trying to clear my head but maybe someone can relate to this. So last night after my parents went to sleep I stayed up (which is normal for me) and like got myself food and put on music and my favourite song came on, and I started dancing and singing like crazy and I really loved that feeling it felt amazing, but when i eventually went to sleep at like 6am (i have a very messed up sleep schedule, was just up watching Netflix and walking around till 6) and then woke up at like 2-3pm felt miserable, like to the point where i didnt get outta bed for another 4hrs also getting stomach pains cos I'm not eating or drinking much for a couple weeks. but I go from super happy loving the moment to don't see the point of getting outta bed and only do get up when I absolutely have to. Its flippin scaring me cos this keeps happening I know my eating drinking, and sleeping schedule isnt helping, still dont quite care enough to fix that.

Just the lows being like too miserable to move or suicidal feelings/plans that dont last more than 48hrs so I know I just gotta try wait it out and then a dayish or half a day or something of super happy trying to get my life back on track. Hate these intense feelings flipping all the time, almost wish I could just stay sad just to break the cycle at this point."

171,Is it just me or does anyone else need music to get through the day,I spend almost 80-90% of my day either listening to music watching a movie or engaging in conversation I can’t do silence in order to sleep because I have depression and anxiety I listen to some music and do a puzzle and when someone at work tells me not to I just wear wireless headphones UGHH is it just me?
172,I am 14 years old and struggling with my mental health.,"Throughout the past few months, I have been noticing that my mental health is declining. I have been overthinking everything, procrastinating my school work (especially math, which I really struggle with), having extreme trouble getting up in the morning, not being able to focus on things, and eating too much. Worst of all, I have developed a sort of tick or something, where I will feel a sort of shivering sensation, and my head jerks to the side, and if it's really bad, my whole body will jerk forward. It also will occasionally include a loud sniffle. This can be especially irritating in school. I have also started regularly going into a sort of state where I feel like I am dreaming randomly throughout the day, which I have heard is a symptom of depersonalization, though I don't have very much knowledge on the subject. People also tend to tell me that I deal with many symptoms of childhood trauma, although I had a great childhood, and live with a loving and supporting family.

I find that I struggle with these types of things when I don't have a day or event to be excited for or looking forward to, and since Christmas new years have just passed, I am feeling exceptionally out of the ordinary. School is starting up again on Monday, and if I'm being honest, I am afraid that my mental state will decline further from here because of stress and lack of sleep. If anyone can offer any advice or coping tactics, or even give me a name for what I am struggling with, it would absolutely mean the world to me. Many thanks! &lt;3"
173,I think I’m depressed,"I do have depression but it’s been a while since I’ve actually felt depressed this year.

Now it’s kinda hitting me hard. It feels like a chore to eat, I am anxious about work- anything I love is just meh and just it’s all grey. On top of that I’m financially fucked and 5 members of my immediate family have covid.  Idk what the next move is now... idk what to do

I just wanna get out of this place"
174,Intrusive visual thoughts of physical harm,"It's been now probably a couple of years that I (25M) sometimes (especially when lying in bed at night) have what I'd call ""intrusive visual thoughts"" of physical harm. The most frequent is testicles being crushed by a shoe/foot, and the last (and new) one was the [zygomatic bone](https://cdn.britannica.com/71/74271-050-6777EC91/Lateral-views-human-skull.jpg) being nailed to a wall from the inside out. I call these ""intrusive visual thoughts"" because they are not hallucinations: I do not see these things, I simply picture them in my mind without much control over their occurence (intrusive). I am not particularly worried about them but I was wondering if they have been studied and if they are linked to some mental disorders."
175,Do I have something like OCD?,"So I have this issue where if I touch something wrong with the palm of my hand I get a really bad feeling. I can't describe it well but it's a pain without pain. Or a tingling kind of sensation. And I have to touch corners or my elbows otherwise it gets worse, once I basically had a breakdown and now, even if I touch corners ect it's still there. I also get the same feeling in the back of my neck if a pile of books isn't straight and neat, or if a list of names on paper aren't straight and in line. And if I see someone touch something awkwardly or touch something just outside the middle of their palm in a video I get the feeling. I've been to a doctor and had some steroid cream, which hasn't helped and we're hoping to get another appointment. So far I've had no luck with a diagnosis."
176,What is wrong with me?,"I (22f) need to figure out what’s wrong with me &amp; fix it. My relationship is at stake because of me &amp; my problems. I’m not sure what kind of mental illness I have, but obviously I have something or else I wouldn’t be reaching out for help. At this point, I’m desperate to figuring out what’s wrong with me &amp; fixing the issue so I can live a long happy life, especially with the man I love.

Here are the symptoms of the everyday problems I have.

* I go crazy sometimes
* I’m sad all the time
* Irritation
* Get upset with the littlest things
* Get angry
* Judgmental
* Think the world is against me &amp; everyone hates me
* I’m never in the wrong
* I hate myself
* I think things aren’t fair a lot
* Getting in a bad mood easily
* I don’t realize what I do until after I do it
* Drinking intensifies bad behavior
* Can’t hold a job, can’t hold down relationships (friends + family)
* I push people away a lot
* When I push people away, I try to pull them back immediately
* Poor financial habits

Could possibly have to do with the abuse as a child &amp; loss of daughter."
177,Motivation Tips for Depression + Self Care/Hygiene Advice (this is really embarrassing) [F],"I imagine I’m probably going to come across pathetic please just bear with me.

I’ve had depression since I was a child, I think it has a lot to do with the environment I grew up in and my upbringing. My depression has always made taking care of myself hard, plus I have sensory processing problems, and my parents were kind of neglectful of me growing up which definitely doesn’t help.

For a little context as a child I was borderline  neglected by both my alcoholic parents and basic hygiene habits weren’t properly taught or enforced. For example I never was taught you have to wash your face. I know that sounds like common sense, but I was never taught that by my parents. I don’t know why that example comes to mind.
On top of that I had undiagnosed sensory processing problems and was depressed so caring for myself was/is difficult for me.
Anyway my point to bringing that up is to paint a picture of the situation. 

During one of the periods my parents were being neglectful of me I remember there was a point when I was only bathing once a week and that was only so I didn’t look bad in front of my moms church friends on Friday nights. Sometimes I wouldn’t even get a shower on Friday and she would just have me wear a hoodie so you couldn’t tell my hair hadn’t been washed in at least a week. This was the kind of mentality I grew up with. She would always act like It was my fault even though I was a child and she was my parent. (I’m not saying it was easy to get me in a shower because of said underlined issues, but she wasn’t even trying) There was one point where I had giant mats in my hair and she yelled at me even though I was never taught how to care for my hair. I’ll give her that I was a little bit older when that happened I was like 10, but still how am I supposed to figure out something properly I was never taught to do. (am I being unreasonable?)

Basic self care/hygiene habits weren’t stressed in my upbringing. When you’re raised in that kind of setting you don’t realize that something isn’t normal and it definitely didn’t process that this wasn’t normal until I lived with other family for a while, but it was too late I physically wasn’t raised right. I know it sounds kind of weird, but this sort of thing really sticks with you.

I suppose you’re wondering why the school never stepped in when there was clearly obvious neglect going on and the answer is I was “home schooled” growing up, I add the quotations because I wasn’t actually being home schooled and that was just another way I was neglected as a child. I still don’t understand how I managed to slip under the radar’s though.

I was wondering if anyone had advice how to take care of ones self. I know I don’t have the best hygiene and I essentially don’t want my gross ass scaring away my current partner. Truthfully this isn’t really for me I guess. Anyway motivation is an issue, like now I know I should brush my teeth, but I don’t. Ideally I should, but I don’t really care. Truthfully I kind of don’t feel worthy to take care of myself right and even just the phrase self care makes me cringe. I could never bring this up Irl even to my therapist therefore I’m using a throwaway account."
178,I'm running out of steam.,"Hi all,
I really don't know what to do anymore. I suppose I should give some background on myself, so you internet experts can properly inform me what flavor of nuts I am. I work in a skilled trade with 12 hour rotating shifts (3 days on, 4 off, 4 nights on, 4 off, and it changes every 6 weeks). I live with a my nearly 3 year old son, my fiancé who is a full time stay at home mom, two 4 month old (and very rambunctious) puppies, an elderly dog, a cat, and to top it off, 4 chickens.
I feel like I am not allowed to relax. It is entirely me pushing that on myself. Anytime I mention that I am stressed or at the end of my rope, my fiance tells me it is ok to relax. I can't do that, though. How am I supposed to relax when there is so much to do? The house is an absolute train wreck, the animals need tending to (or in the puppies' case, full-time attention and constant training), our toddler needs to be watched/cared for, etc. My brain will always find something to agonize over. 
The only exception is when I am adjusting back to night shifts every other week. I can actually adjust fairly quickly to night shifts, but I say it takes me a couple days of staying up late or even all night (minor fib, shoot me). I use this time when everyone is asleep to do something I want, which is generally computer games. However I am finding that only being able to have a hobby for about 12 hours total every two weeks is not enough to dissipate stress, and it's beginning to cascade on itself.
I have a very short temper and I feel horrible about it. I haven't always been this way either. I hate to say it but I only got this way after our son was born. I do my best to keep it under wraps. Gradually it began to surface more and more. I direct my anger and rage at myself usually, feeling that I deserve all the hatred and misery it brings because I shouldn't have feelings like that. It doesn't make sense but that is how I am wired now. It isn't getting better or going away. This is partly why I have sunk to the point where I am asking internet strangers for advice (no offense guys).
I know my fiance hates it. She cant stand when I am anything other than outwardly happy. If I act down she irritatedly asks me ""what's wrong"". Her tone seems like she finds my less-than-chipper mood inconvenient, and the last thing I want to be is inconvenient. It is so stupid and I know it, but that is how my brain works. 

Sorry for the long post, I have kept quiet for a couple years and I have no outlet. I tried not to rant. What do you guys think? What should I do? What is my problem? I don't like where this path is going.

-some hopeless guy on the internet"
179,Off all my meds,"I’ve been on the road to getting off my meds and today is my first day taking absolutely none. I feel like my skin is going to crawl off my body, and I need to bury myself in sand. I’m having hot flashes and my head is doing this thing where I can feel myself focusing.
I knew it would be hard, but holy f*ck I feel sick!"
180,Not feeling sad or happy... Or anything else tbh...,"Hard to explain it in words but I feel like everything is grey. Neutral to anything, not feeling happiness or sadness for the past couple of days(tho i only noticed it a few hours ago)
I think it might be a defence mechanism of suppressing feelings in order to stay intact.
I can still think of things that would make me happy or sad
I'm 19, don't really have friends except from 1 guy I'm cool with, we can talk a bit.
I'm at service in the army (not USA) so in week days we work most of the time or just do nothing, but in weekends only a couple of people stay here so im kinda lonely, tho im not feeling lonely.
Never had a S/O, wish i had, when thinking about it I've never even had a crush.


Don't have anyone to talk to about this first of all because I don't know how to explain myself, second of all i don't trust anyone.(that's another problem i have, i no longer give my trust, now you have to earn it)

Just wanted to put it out there, if anyone feels like they can help me I'll be glad to get some help."
181,"I'm constantly having conversations with myself in my head and pretend its with other people in my life (i.e. my idols, or friends and family members).","I have no idea if this is the right subreddit.

I've been doing this for at least 5-6 years. I'm currently 16F (turning 17 in a little over a month). 

I have a whole system in my mind as if it is something that is programmed into my brain. It lets people see into my life, watch everything through my eyes. I have the option to turn my privacy on/off. Privacy on means that nobody can talk to me and I'm all alone, privacy off means whoever joins means they can see everything through my eyes. 

Whenever privacy is on, I have different modes as well. When I have privacy on, I can make it so people who join can see my laptop, phone screen or face. Simply by saying ""phone on/off"" etc. This way they can't see whats around me, but they can see whatever I want them to see.

I also have the option to ban people if I don't want them to join. 

This all sounds... crazy. I know. But for years it brought me comfort. I got bullied a lot growing up. When the bullying finally stopped, my parents got a divorce. (I was 12, almost 13 here) The day after my parents split up, I was introduced to my stepmom who has since been making my life a living hell.

This whole thing in my head never really bothered me, until recently. My ex and I had a mutual breakup in September, but I had a rough time getting over him. To be fair, I'm still not 100% over him (but I'd say I'm at a solid 99% now). The thing keeping me from fully getting over him is that whenever I'm doing something, I imagine him joining and watching everything through my eyes. I don't imagine talking to him, but just him spectating me so he's with me, I guess. Whenever I feel the urge to have him ""join"" me, I do have the power to shake it off, but then again I get reminded of him and it's emotionally exhausting.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanna know if anyone else does this. It's not **just** having casual conversations talking to myself. I'm constantly talking to others in my head. It's quite literally making me go ""nuts"" and I want it to stop. I wanna fully stop doing this but I don't know how. I don't even know what it is.  

Just a note: I **can** see the difference between what's happening in my mind vs what's reality, that is no problem for me. I am fully aware of everything and it's not like I isolate myself for weeks and only talk to myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also: As far as I know there are no mental ""issues"" in my family. I've never spoken up about this to anyone in my life. This is the first time ever I've written it down, ready to share it with others. I'm also not taking any medicine (other than birth control for the past 2 months) so it's not some kind of side effect either. I did just contact a therapist to see if I can make an appointment again as soon as possible. I've never discussed this with any therapist either, but I will be planning on doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I (16F) have constant conversations with people in my head and I have a whole system for it, as if it's a computer program in my brain. For years (started in 2014/2015) I wasn't bothered by it, up until my recent breakup. This constant convo-thing is making it very hard for me to get over my ex and I just want to stop doing all of this altogether. Not on any meds, contacted a therapist about 45 minutes ago. Waiting for a response (it's almost midnight here and Christmas break still so not expecting anything until at least Monday)"
182,How to get self esteem.,"So i always had a problem that I have never ever belived in my self.

Thank you"
183,Trust,I really hate it when a friend tells you all about how you can trust them and talk to them when in reality anything you say to them your actually saying to an entire group whether their intentions are good or bad  it destroys ones ability to trust
184,Why do I lose interest whenever I picture myself doing well?,"I have had a lot of interests (from acting to scriptwriting to dancing to writing songs to fashion designing to podcasting to blogging to YouTube) just in 2020. 

The thing is whenever I think of myself doing good and becoming successful in the line that I took interest in, I lose interest. The excitement I had at the beginning would vanish and I will be back to feeling empty and sometimes suicidal. 

For example, I got into songwriting late last year and I was so excited. I showed it to trusted friends and they liked it. I am putting plans in place to produce one of the songs. Then this night, I pictured myself successful and all the excitement went away. I tell myself I never actually enjoyed writing songs (I know I did) and I know the same thing is going to happen with whatever interest I have next. 

I don't know what's happening to me and I need to know. I can't get anything done because of it. I don't know what to do. Once the interest is gone, I feel empty and question my existence. Then I find another interest and it's another circle and on it goes."
185,TW!! I am going to be talking about self harm and abusive relationships,"So in around September I met a boy I’m going to call Jacob, we were best friends and talked everyday. A few weeks ago I met a boy we are going to call Mack. I immediately fell for Mack, so we agreed to start dating. It was good for a while then he broke up with me for my best friend  we’re going to call Mary. I was frustrated but then Jacob said he had a crush on me. we consented to a relationship and it was ok for a while, then he started to hurt me mentally, then I learned Mary and Mack broke up. Jacob started dating Mary. So now mary had dated both of my recent boyfriends. I started to hate her, she took everything from me. I started to hurt myself because i felt worthless. I now am having to go to residential care because of my instability. I’m trying to stop drinking and hurting myself. If you read all of this thank you."
186,I feel so trapped.,"I like with my ex girlfriend.  I broke up with her a few weeks ago and we still live together. She's the vulnerable type and very needy. I've persevered for the last year and tried to make it work but now I don't want it to work. She always wants to talk about it, every day and I allow it, but end up getting frustrated and upset myself. I feel guilt and sadness about the whole situation but just want to move on.  


Our tenancy ends in April. I'll be moving in with my friend around that time, up North so I can participate in clinical trials to clear my debt. I can't afford to live alone. I'm a teacher but work via teaching agencies which means I don't get sick pay or holiday pay and don't get anything while the schools aren't open. I've been out of work because of Covid and school closures again. My online teaching job doesn't provide enough hours and I don't drive. I fucked up a lot of my life with drugs and addiction but I'm now sober.  


My friend and I can't move in somewhere now because he can't access his things from his old place where his friend lives, because his friend is heavily disabled and with this Covid situation, no one is allowed to enter. My friend is also in a wheelchair and the places we're looking at moving into are limited because he needs a wet room (walk/roll in shower). My computer broke on Christmas day but I managed to mostly fix it. I can't move in with any of my family temporarily because of this virus, and my ex girlfriend is in the same situation. We've just been arguing again and I hate it - I was never the type to argue but she pushes my buttons. She's been abused in the past by her exes and I've never laid a finger on a woman, and I will never do it. But I feel like she's the type who provokes a reaction.  


While everyone has been affected by Covid in many ways, I'm lucky to have not lost any friends and family, even though older relatives have had it. I hate to moan about it and have always avoided talking about it; I believe it's too easy to use it as an excuse. When we moved in, our kitchen flooded and we had to move out temporarily. We moved back in and didn't have hot water. The plumbers came numerous times but the problem keeps coming back. At best, luke warm water sprinkles over me. I'm trying to be grateful for everything I DO have but I just needed to vent...  


Sorry for the disjointed nature of this. I just want to get the hell out of this place now!!"
187,Fear of my sister comitting again,"I have an older sister, 21, who has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and more recently rapid cycling bipolar. In the past 2 years she tried/ plan to commit four times, all of which occurred outside the house, apart from one, and were very traumatic experiences for me. After going back and forth to psych wards she's finally very stable, medicated, has finally finished her first semester of uni since taking a break and is in a good place in her relationship with her SO. Despite her doing better I cannot get over my fear of her committing again. Every time she leaves the house I get this intense paranoia and suspicion that she's trying to commit again. I constantly check her phone's location, her search history, etc. and cannot get anything done until she comes back. Even when I know she's doing mentally well I still feel this way, albeit a little less paranoid. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this anxiety? It is very mentally draining and makes it very hard for me to carry on and focus on myself without stressing over her and tracking her every second to make sure she is okay."
188,Made it past Paxil withdrawals,"I thought I would have to get a prescription to get off this prescription. Vertigo, nausea, “brain zaps???”, the works. 

Furthermore I’m in the middle of a divorce and have had to hide the side effects from my STBX who is always looking into things that are not her business.

It’s been about 14 days, I was having withdrawals every 30 minutes and now maybe once every 3 hours. I feel like I have the emotional investment to put into things I need or want to do. I was only on this medicine to survive and now it’s time to start over.

Happy new year"
189,helpful mental health influencers,"I had an idea to start a thread of positive mental health influencers. If you have one or a few, drop them here!

I know that here, no one really likes tiktok, but there are some gems on there. there is a woman by the name of Jazz Thornton that posts positive mental health content. A book and movie were even made about her life and own personal story. I highly recommend you check her out!"
190,Can anyone here relate to me?,"Or maybe, ever had to leave a job due to your mental health affecting it?

It's okay if it's just one or the other, I just feel a bit pathetic right now, because now it's new year, I'm turning 28 in June, I'm disabled due to anxiety and depression (I'm autistic too but idk if that counts towards it or not) and still living with my mum at home.

I know you shouldn't move out until you're ready to, I know it's different for everyone and you shouldn't let people pressure you into moving out before you're ready, and I've been told by numerous people not to get a job until I feel ""ready to"", I do have some ambitions for the future but they're a long way down the line yet even if I do manage to achieve them, but I feel like the older I get, my anxiety comes back about it, because I feel like a failure compared to other people my age, even though I know it's not like I'm deliberately choosing not to work and being lazy. Being disabled is a valid reason, but even so, it does make me feel a bit useless sometimes, so is there anyone out there who can relate?"
191,creating titles gives me raging anxiety every. single. time.,"I would like to start by saying I am in no way trying to get a diagnosis from you, but rather asking you to share experiences or knowledge you may have. 

TLDR; insomnia but it’s not that I can’t sleep, it’s that I won’t sleep???? Don’t want to sleep? 

I am 22F, I am clinically diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and in the last year was diagnosed with PTSD. I manage, my depression isn’t swallowing me, my anxiety is.... about the same it has been for the last year or so. I am still learning about PTSD and what it means for me and even still learning what it exactly is, with that being said, I feel like my symptoms have been mild (and constantly improving over the course of a few months), so I am not flagging it as the source or cause of my issue. I could just be undereducated on the subject though. 

I have felt like my mind and my body are at war with each other, fighting over dominance. When I think about my sense of self, my body isn’t me anymore than I would be my car. — That’s actually irrelevant to my *actual* thought-provoking question/topic, BUT it feels good to unload and I think it adds some flair to my feelings and I guess maybe it could be relevant. Good (or bad?) food for thought. 

Anyways, the real reason I am here today is because I can’t convince myself to go ! to ! bed ! when I should be tired or KNOW that I would fall asleep quickly once in bed. I just stay up. Can’t explain it, don’t know why I do it. I don’t want to sleep, I know I need it, I know most days I would feel a little perkier with more rest, I crave sleep, but I don’t want to sleep! Literally what is wrong with me, I’m too logical to legitimately be insane (I think???? Crazy people don’t know they are crazy, right?) but I know when my mind is tired and my body is tired, yet I have been just powering through. When I do crash, I sleep long, I sleep hard, I sleep good. On average I’m probably sleeping close to every other day now, as this has been going on for over a month, nearly two. No, I am not on drugs, nothing I am ingesting or inhaling or exposed to is “new” to me so it’s not like a change caused this shift. I don’t know, I’m just looking for someone to relate? Anyone to kind of know what I mean or just make sense of my unorganized and scattered thoughts? Encouraging words, advice, tips, etc is of course, welcomed. Open to all suggestions. Either way, thanks for reading!


I would also like to apologize for how choppy ?? this may sound idek i edited and added in different orders LOL my apologies~"
192,Getting mixed messages from depressed friend,"I have very little experience with people that have depression. So I don't know if their behaviour is due to them not wanting to hangout or because of mental health. 

My friend is a foreign student in the UK. 

Been friends with them for a few months. They told me 2 months ago they've been really struggling with their mental health. they've had suicidal thoughts. They've spoken to councillors etc and are trying to get a therapist. 

We started meeting up when we could. It seemed to be helping and we were getting closer as friends. They couldn't go home for Xmas due to long quarantine times for traveling. It would have been a month of quarantine for just couple of days. I offered to chill with them around Xmas and they seemed up for it at the time. But they started getting distant with messaging. I asked if they're okay. They said yeah just hanging with another friend. So I was cool, was happy they weren't in a bad place mentally. 

But it's now been about 2-3 weeks of this very slow messaging. I didn't see them over Xmas apart from me dropping by to give them my Xmas gift. So I backed off messaging. Gave them space and focused on myself. 

They've messaged recently asking how I was then a few days later saying sorry, they've been struggling mentally and been busy getting life back on track. I dunno what to do. I didn't like being put on the shelf, ya know. Plus I dont know how to react when someone tells me they are busy but also struggling. I can't push my way in to help because they clearly don't want it. 

I was thinking of just straight up asking them what the deal is in a message but it could be too confrontational. And I don't want to be horrible if they are struggling. Any thoughts/advice are very welcome"
193,How to handle the situation?,"Hey people!

I've been the happiest person I could possibly be through 2019 and most of 2020. I've been Backpacking through Asia for 1,5 years on my own. I saw many places, enjoyed the ultimate freedom and met a massive amount of people from all around the world. Even though I traveled alone - I never was alone. It was in fact a time of massive socializing.

But then covid happened and at some point I went back to my home country. I was happy to see family and friends. 

Now my happiness and positivity is gone. I'm empty.
No traveling because our countries shut their borders. Its currently very hard to find a job. 
I'm sitting back home with no tasks, doing nothing except of applying for jobs. I don't have any perspective for the new year 2021 and absolutely no positive mindset anymore.

I was berated constantly, was told to leave and stay in my car when my presence. I attempted once by trying to overdose because the constant stress and all the rest was killing me. Maybe I’m just weak and need to learn be tougher. It wasn’t like this in the beginning I just I don’t know. I keep telling myself that I’m too soft and I should know better.

195,TW. Please help me help my partner,"Hi Reddit. Trigger warning for daterape drugs and sexual abuse.


I'm scared for my partner's safety. We are both polyamorous. I am married with a child and I am dating someone I'll refer to as my partner. They are non-binary, presenting female. They have a history of self-harm and addiction stemming from sexual abuse they received as child and more recently. They also have BPD.


My partner recently, under their own volition, took a roofie with alcohol in order to lose control. They got the drug from a guy they've been dating and the guy did stuff to them while they were out. This was all part of the plan and they had consented beforehand. I didn't know about it till afterwards.
I'm very uncomfortable with degrading my partner but it is something they enjoy. They get it from other sexual partners so it's not something I feel the need to engage in.
But this seems like a step way too fucking far.


Tonight they took the drug again, without the alcohol so they're still compos mentis. But I'm worried about them getting addicted. I'm worried about them choking on their own vomit while they're sleeping. They tell me they're safe because the guy is there. I don't know if I want to kill him or thank him for watching over my partner. They've given me his number so I can check up on them. I want to scream at him but I won't cos then I lose communication.


My partner says that they're doing it in order to work through stuff in a safe environment. They were sexually abused as a small child so I can almost see this as a type of exposure therapy. But it also feels like self-harm.


I mean, is there any way that this can end well? They say it's good. That it's been good for them. But I don't see how that's possible.


I don't know what to do. I want to know how I can help them through this without them pushing me away. We're going to discuss their plans for this year tomorrow, which I think might help. I think keeping busy might help. I don't want to lose them and I don't want them to push me away. Please help me."
196,My opinion on schools and mental health.,"I feel that schools don't talk about mental health and the effects it has nearly as much as they should. I'm from the UK so I don't know how it is in the rest of the world, but over here we have days dedicated to a certain subject e.g. Internet safety, anti-bullying, etc. I fail to understand why mental health isn't a more commonly talked about subject, especially when it is so important.

I don't know how it is for the rest of the world, but from what I've seen, the education system fails to incorporate education about mental health when it really should. Especially to teenagers, who are quite prone to mental health issues. Does anyone else agree?"
197,What is wrong with me?,"I think there is something wrong with me. This past week or so, I’ve felt really low, which has increasingly progressed into complete brain fog, finding it extremely hard to concentrate on ANYTHING and headaches. 

I feel insane, this is the best way I can explain it: 

I feel as though there is someone else inside of my head, trying to kill my brain, not me, my brain. Which explains the feeling of brain fog/ feeling as though my brain is frying up. 

For two nights I have been hearing voices and noises that I don’t know where they are coming from, and they scare me. They are nothing malicious or disturbing, just really scary. The noises sound like a computer starting up/the notifications on a windows computer, or banging/ knocking. The voices are  both a man and woman, the man sounds like my dad whispering, he has only whispered my name, but that is it. The woman started talking in my head last night, I had just finished reading up to chapter 15 of ‘The bell jar’ by Sylvia Plath and as I was getting into bed whilst on my phone, she kept going on and on and on about depression and suicide, as if she were writing a story like the book, it didn’t sound like me at all, but it did sound similar In the sense of the way she was writing, if that makes sense? I told her to shut up because she was getting on my nerves and was making my brain feel overfilled with thoughts so she did, it felt like a part of me left too. 

I’ve also been extremely paranoid about people in the street. Every time I pass a window I feel as though people are watching and are spying on me/ stalking me.  I’ve seen a few people walking the streets at the same time, which is very unlikely for my street, it isn’t a busy one at all, so I’m not sure if that was real or not.

I’m just very scared, but at the same time I don’t feel anything. I feel that whoever is in my brain is trying to end me, and they are reading and listening to my thoughts and feelings and are taking them away from me and sending them to important people who will use them against me in some way. 

Maybe I’m being extremely over dramatic and perhaps this will blow over soon.

I have also started talking to myself out loud which i used to do A LOT when I was younger about 11-13 when I was extremely ill (mentally) it was as like a coping mechanism for me. However when I am doing this I want to stop it, because it makes me feel insane and weird, but I couldn’t stop it and it carried on. Once I did stop I felt as though I had yet again been stripped from my own thoughts and feelings, I feel as though I am nothing but a body. 

Mirrors are really freaking me out, I hate looking in them or being next to one for long as I feel that I can see a reflection in them that aren’t mine,staring at me through the mirror, and when I turn to look in the mirror nothing is there, and as I start to feel panicky I feel as though the people in my head are mocking me although they say nothing. 

Nothing much has happened today, just extreme paranoia and low mood. I haven’t felt this low in quite some time. I spend most of the day on call with friends playing mario kart and animal crossing, which SHOULD have been fun, but I couldn’t help but feel nothing, complete bleakness. 

I feel like a robot, I feel nothing.

I know if I say anything to either one of my parents they will just tell me to stop reading The bell jar, I guess it probably isn’t helping, as it is literally about suicide and depression, but in some sort of sick twisted way, it comforts me, and it isn’t the book, as I’ve been feeling out of place since Christmas Day, before I even picked up the book. 

I hate being alone, as that’s when I feel most scared/paranoid and when I hear more things, nothing really happens when I’m with people. But then again, I want to be alone, because I feel like shit. And I just want to lock myself away and wallow in my own pathetic pitifulness. 

I wrote this three days ago, I haven’t heard anymore voices or sounds since then, but the extreme paranoia has persisted and so has the brain fog. 

Time seems to go so fast and I’m finding it hard to know what day it is and what I’ve done all week it  seems like this big blur.

I feel insane, but I do think there is someone else in my head. 

If there is anyone who has any idea what may be wrong with me or any helpful tips or coping mechanisms to deal with this, I will appreciate it at no end."
198,Beginning Battle of Fighting Depression,"So I have been taking medication for my depression and I think its starting to work; the doctor said 4-6 weeks and its been almost or about that. I've been feeling a little more motivated and happy i think, but im having trouble coming to terms with that because i havent been okay or happy or motivated or wanting to be here for a long time so it feels weird not feeling that way all the time. Its like some part of me doesn't think I deserve to feel better bc I got so used to being unhappy. If you read this thank you for listening. ❤️"
199,I Abuse My Cat,"Before I start, please don’t just judge and shame me in your replies. I know what I do is awful and wrong, and I want to stop. I just don’t know how and I don’t know why I do these things. I’m just looking for some help, advice, and insight. Thank you. 

I need help. I know I do. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I have been abusing a cat that I just adopted only a few days ago. He showed up at my workplace and my boss told me we needed to leave him alone and not feed him or give him water so he would go away but he just kept coming back. The caring person inside of me said I couldn’t just let the poor cat starve and freeze in this winter cold so I took him home to stay with me. But there is something very dark inside me that I can’t seem to control.

The urge to hurt this poor cat - hell, even a desire to watch it slowly suffer and die is uncontrollable. I have been choking him out consistently, choking him by his neck and just watching him writhe in mid air as he suffocates, throwing him, slamming him on the walls and floors and furniture, chasing him when he hides and dragging him out from under furniture by his tail. I don’t know why I do it and I don’t like that I do it but the urge is so uncontrollable. I’ve noticed that it’s started to escalate dramatically over the past few days. Even to the point where I’m doing it while my roommates are home and could catch me. What’s odd though too is that I have a dog as well. And I have never EVER had these thoughts towards him. I love my dog to death and I would die for him. I would kill myself before I ever laid a hand on him. 

I like this cat. I honestly do. He’s showed me love and he’s so sweet. He doesn’t really ever act up, he’s cuddly, well behaved, quiet (for the most part). He really is a good cat but I can’t get rid of that desire to just crush him and hurt him. I’m able to control myself when he’s just minding himself and not doing anything, but as soon as he does the slightest thing to bother me I snap. It’s odd too - even his meowing just absolutely infuriates me. And now I’m at the point to where I think about how I could hurt him just when I’m looking at him and touching him. Even when he’s just cuddling with me. 

I even fantasize of hurting him now. Even when I’m not home. I think about the terrible ways I could kill him and make him suffer. I know I should give him away but I really don’t want to. Like I said, I really like this cat and I love the affection he shows me and that I show him when I’m able to control myself. But every day the urge gets more and more intense and it escalates more and more. I also don’t want to have to explain to my roommates why I’m getting rid of him and all the people that keep asking me about him since they know I adopted him. (Not to mention the amount of money I’ve already spent on him) I feel so much shame over how I treat him and I am scared to tell anyone. That’s why I’m putting it here. I am terrified that this is just a glimmer of something much more evil inside of me and that something is seriously wrong with me mentally. I’m terrified of thinking that these behaviors could possibly be extended to another human. It scares me even more to think it could be my girlfriend. 

Does anyone have an answer? Why do I do these things? Why can’t I stop myself? Why do I fantasize about it? Is there something seriously psychologically wrong with me? I just need some help and insight. 

About me:

200,Something I have been experiencing,"So I’ve recently been experiencing a strange sensation that I have actually had for years now and it causes me all sorts of problems. Basically, to cut it short, it is a feeling of my thoughts somehow being disembodied from me. 

I get thoughts that feel like they aren’t actually mine, almost like there is a person speaking inside my head. This isn’t hallucinatory (I don’t think), it isn’t something I actually hear and it’s not like a voice talks to me, but like my own thoughts are being spoken back to me inside my own head. This is not permanent - it just appears at random, every few seconds normally. 

This can be twinned with actually feeling music played in my head, like the sensation of listening to music in my ears. Sometimes even the sensation of a person talking is there in my head. 

I have been concerned about experiencing this for years. Last year I had a particularly bad mental health crisis, with panic attacks (unrelated to this), but this music got most intense at that time. 

For years I have thought I am going insane when I get this sensation. Really my explanation of it here is quite limited because it is so hard to actually describe! 

Is there anything that it can be labelled with? What even is it supposed to be? Getting some clarity on this would definitely put my mind to rest, at least a bit. Thanks!"
201,Help me find a way to deal with people better?,"I have never been much of a people person. I am great with people one on one especially when I am in a new environment, but as soon as I get in groups of people, even those that I am super close with, I typically just sit on the edge and just basically watch and listen without interacting much. I think my biggest problem is just dealing with asking people for things and doing things. For example, my mother’s 50th birthday is coming up but because of covid she can’t have a party like she wanted to because most of our friends and family live in a different country. I have been trying to reach out to people asking them to send her a letter, but simply sending people emails or texts asking them to help me really stresses me out. I sent a few texts last night and had responses by the morning but I avoided looking at them all day because it just freaked me out for some reason. This happens a lot when I try to ask people for a reference or just asking anything of someone I wouldn’t usually talk to. I also put things off to the absolute last minute because it stresses me out so much. I don’t really know why I think like this, but if anyone knows what I am going through or has any helpful hints as to how to work through it, that would be great! Thank you in advance for helping me!"
202,A teenager’s confused and scared rant...,"Mods please remove this if it doesn’t fit here.
I’m not sure if this is the right flare. I put ‘question’ because it seemed to fit best.

Hi. Sorry in advance for this rant. You should probably stop reading now if you som’t have the patience for the miserable ramblings of an edgy, self-pitying teenager that thinks they’re entitled to complain. Anyway. If you’re still here I thank and pity you.
I have a pretty good life. I’m the kid of two loving parents, and am in a stable economic situation. My brother’s not in the best of times -he’s suffering from a nasty chronic illness- but he’s getting by. I should by all accounts be happy.
But for some reason I’m not. I have everything I could possibly want, but everything just seems... off. Like in a horror movie when everything seems too perfect. The world seems... unreal sometimes. I stand in the garden, and see the birds fly by, and it seems... dreamy. Sort of off, like a perfectly written script, but the delivery is ever so slightly stilted and unnerving.
I seem fake sometimes, too. I look in the mirror, and see what seems to be an alien face looking back at me. I know logically that it is me, but it seems off, so human-looking, yet so profoundly *wrong*. Sometimes I look out my bedroom window at the scripted cars and plastic trees, and the arm holding it open seems fake. Like a UI element in a video game. I stand and stare sometimes, the world blurring, taking a backseat to bizarrely soul-searching thoughts, or a lack thereof. I then look at a clock, and see I’ve been standing there for two hours. Sometimes someone sees me ‘blair-witching’ and wakes me up. They think it’s a joke or something.
Some days, I feel like a wall has been pulled down in my mind. Those days I spend hours on end hunched over my laptop, waxing poetic about the wonder of life and spewing forth endless word salads about saving the world. Some days I lie in my bed, contemplating my mistakes in complete lack of motivation to do anything else.
I forget things sometimes, too. I’ll walk to a room, and forget not only what I’m doing there, but how I got there. I’ll turn on my computer to do homework, only to stare at the screen for fifteen minutes, wondering why I’m sitting there. I have a weirdly accurate recollection of facts and dates, but I completely forget names and faces. I remember some parts of my past like watching a film, but there are stretches of time that seem nonexistent in my memories.
I’m autistic, but the symptoms of that are clearly documented and almost certainly nothing to do with any of this. And no, that does not invalidate my opinion or observations.
The reason I’m posting this here is because I’m confused as to what to do. I know this isn’t normal, I know there’s something wrong with me, but all my limited research into psychology and mental illnesses is unreliable, seen as I’m not a mental health professional.
The few times I’ve tried bringing any of this up with my parents, they said the incredibly useless lines of ‘it’s hormones’ and ‘you’re a teenager’. I won’t bring it up with the school counsellor, as she has completely lost my trust after outing me as trans to my parents, which took a whole lot of what I can only describe as borderline-sociopathic lying and face-making (? Translated phrase) to cover up and make them happy.
So I’m posting this here in the hopes of someone telling me what to do. I’m confused and scared; reality seems fake and I’m stuck.
Sorry for the rant."
203,I have been dealing with a mental block for sometime now and I can’t seem to get rid of it any ideas on how to help me,"I’ve always been interested in sport and was competing at amatuer level in kickboxing I had been training for about a year in it but I made what some might say was a stupid decision to leave this was not because of loss of interest but more of a loss of love of my self leading up to when I left the club I had suffered three devastating losses 2 in competition and 1 outside of competition which really started the downfall one of my best friends at the time had been conspiring to jump me he had waited a full 6 months of planning to wait until I had just lost a lengthy relationship being at my lowest and having no clue what was going on he took advantage of it all and beat me up after that I was made I fool of from friends and Acquaintances as they saw it to be an amazing achievement for my friend to beat me as I was known for my interest in kickboxing after this I was placed in a fight on one days notice which I lost and got pretty beat up In due to this I also was injured thus could not properly train at all for another fight which was only 2 weeks after the former one so as you could probably tell I lost that one too after this it completely broke me my confidence and drive we’re shattered I left the club as I didn’t believe I was good enough but now I was stuck in a whole as now the only thing that I thought I could succeed in suddenly all left my reach and now 6 months later I have turned into a life of misery I’ve started taking substances to give me something to look forward to, before I was clean and never touched anything now I smoke marijuana every day and constantly look forward to the weekends as it’s my time to drink and take other substances I can tell that I’m not progressing at all in life but I don’t feel like there is a way out"
204,New year and all I can do is cry and self harm,"Almost relapsed and my friend is pissed and upset, I left my state to move in with him to recover from drugs and I bought some"
205,"I'm really struggling mentally, daily suicidal thoughts. 25 years old, just want somewhere to vent","To start, if someone looked at my life, they would ask, what do you have to be sad about?

I have a loving boyfriend, I live in a nice home, I have a full-time job which I enjoy and I'm lucky to have retained in the pandemic, I'm not the least attractive person in the world, but not a jaw-dropper by any means.

But I honestly find myself thinking about suicide so frequently. I just can't open up to anyone. If anyone asks, how are you? I just say good, and you? How do you even have that conversation. There are people that know I have struggled with self-harm and depression but really don't reach out, not that I should rely on that, because no one is liable for me, except me.

It not for attention, it's not for any drama or spotlight. I keep people at arm's length and I really struggle to maintain friendships. I just don't trust a lot of people. I'm not close with my family, we just are different people. I'm always thinking, but why do people care? if they ask about me. They have their own lives? What do they gain from talking to me? I find myself talking to myself a lot, almost as an escape to pass time to see if I can just forget about my thoughts.

When I am with people, I get told how lovely I am to be around but I feel that when I am on my own, I am a completely different person, almost like I've perfected this act.

I'm on antidepressants and I just keep thinking, take more, just do it. Has anyone ever related and gotten out the other side?

Thank you for anyone that has taken the time to read this"
206,Are my relationship fears coming true?,"Due to a plethora of reasons, I have trouble opening up and feeling like I am important in a romantic relationship.  Often in relationships, I have fears that I am secretly disliked by loves ones, of becoming a burden, and of being easily abandoned. 

This year I saw a talk therapist for a while and now a psychiatrist. Currently on medication and learning a lot about myself. (ADHD diagnosed, body/gender dysphoria, anxiety, possiblity of Bipolar Disorder)


My partner has been with me when before I started getting professional help and has talked me through several ""meltdowns"" or panics. These usually happened at a job or in some social situations. Even a few happened after I started medication.  I almost wouldnt tell him it was happening and it would take a lot to decide to trust him / reach out. The whole time, I guarantee you, I am saying how stupid I feel and how embarrassing it is not to be able do something so ""simple"" to everyone else. The way the conversations went, he always seemed to encourage me to place my wellness over the job or people expectations. 

These moments were important to me. Even recently, when I spiraled into some sadness and doubts, I looked at those moments as examples my fears were could be voiced and that he accepts me. 

....then New Years Eve, when commenting on how well someone delivered groceries to our place, an old ""meltdown"" I had trying to work the gig economy came up. He said to me ""yeah, when you were freaking out over absolutely nothing""...

.....earlier that day, we had also been talking about inspections (again related to a past job) and he tells me about the kind of stuff he's seen people get away. I brought it up before, but I tell him again, I use to be afraid of crossing bridges when I was a teenager. I legitimately would be in a panic driving, feeling like it was going to collapse under me any second. But he like....keeps going on about it. I'll take a joke or two, but as I leave the room and mention I was going to try to purposely forget all this so my fear wouldn't return, he says ""don't worry, I will be sure to remind you later about it"".....

I feel betrayed and unsure. Hearing how ridiculous he thought of that moment makes me wonder what he really thinks of me and my mental struggles.  I was trying my best and have verbalized often how I felt like a failure in those moments. I was glad someone didn't expect me to be ""normal"". 

What is happening?
Am I reading to deep? because it seems to me, he actually thinks my panic and fears are silly? My stressors are not noteworthy? Does he think now that I'm medicated, those things still don't worry or trigger me?"
207,vent about how i’ve been feeling recently,"over this past week i’ve developed this constant constant preoccupation (if that’s what u would call it ??) with my tummy. and more specifically, how it looks from the side. you see i’m kind of okay with it from the front but when i turn to the side i literally start to get suicidal because i realise how huge my gut is. i feel so disgusting

i feel absolutely hideous and i don’t ever want to go out again. i’ve never really cared so much about my weight because it was always about my face but now i just can’t stop thinking about how much my tummy sticks out from the side.
i’m so uncomfortable all of the time too because i’ve been subconsciously sucking it in whenever i’m sitting down and it’s almost as if i can FEEL how fat i am and how bulging my stomach is


so this is it. this is how it’s going to be. i’m never ever going to meet anybody, never get a gf, never have anybody attracted to me. because of my face and my body. screw personality. this is unfixable. i don’t see how i’ll ever get anywhere in life looking like this. and how, HOW am i supposed to go about my daily life and go to school and be with friends when i’m so huge and UGLY????

im really losing it over this. i cant escape from all of these thoughts i just wish i could exist without body or face i don’t wanna look like this"
208,i need advice for my friend,"[TW/ brake ups, suicidal thoughts, etc.] so i’ve been dating this person for a while, we both are trans, bi, minors and have different mental disorders. we had both contributed a lot to this imaginary dream life we could live together and i think it was something that helped him go through out his day to day life a lot. recently i realized i’m aroace (i feel no romantic or sexual feelings) and i wasn’t comfortable being in a relationship with them for that reason and we’re just very not compatible. so yesterday i broke up with him, i just said how i felt how he made me uncomfortable and i can’t be with him and i think of him more like a brother than anything and he’s not taken it well. he has an awful home life with 5 parents due to just that much divorce, he has tons of homophobic family and people around him, and almost have of his parents are verbally and occasionally physically abusive. he’s very suicidal and co dependent and his parents refuse to get any help for him for all his mental issues. his parents have also started taking away his coaping mechanisms and such and i really wanna help but we live in different states and he has a lot of school left and i don’t know what i can do to help. can someone give me advice, coaping mechanisms, grounding techniques, even therapy through calls and stuff that would be really cheap so i’d be able to pay? i really wanna help"
209,Giving advice on social media/informing others,"Okay. I usually don't like to get advice, but I ACTUALLY want advice here, lol!

So I really like to post on social media. Sometimes I really want to talk about a topic that is important for me. For example the difference between traditional meditation practice and modern ""feel-good meditations"". 

So let's say I'll write a post, I'll re-read and edit it a bit... and then I post it. Maybe I get some likes and comments... and then SHIT HITS ME! O\_O

UGHHHH I forgot to mention THIS, I forgot to mention THAT... I could have said THIS and THAT to make it sound a bit nicer and friendlier.. I could have said THAT THAT THIS THIS to make it sound easier... OMG there is a typo!!! AHRHGRHGHRHH.

I basically want to text to be PERFECT, to INCLUDE THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD and to be as wise as written from a 100 years old monk. 

But I'm just a 26 years old dude, lol!

Sooo: does anyone have any advice here?

Am I still allowed to post ""informal/advice-giving"" posts on social media??? I honestly think my advice is good. I'm in therapy for over 10 years. I've done psychedelics and re-integrated my trips. I have done A LOT of mental work and stuff. 

But yea, I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. I forget some things. Idk."
210,A mental health server!,"I found a good mental health server on discord if anyone wants to join.

211,"With my past incidents of too many accidents early in my previous job, would flight school be suicidal?","I know I've been posting alot about helicopter and regular flight training here and on the appropriate threads for months now. But it seems like I keep trying to either ""stay with it"" or ""talk myself out of it"". At the beginning, it was the accumulated costs of the civilian flight training programs(I'm too old for any branch of the military and even if I tried to enlist with the air force with their upper age limit of 39, they'd still probably give me the finger and deny me flight school even if I got tried to hammer down and get a BA/BS in something by my mid-40s. It's like retiring as a ""high enlisted"" is all I'll ever get out of there and I feel that's beneath me at this age).   


After that it was the amount of time it would take to see my current truck driver salary again as a helicopter pilot. Put in all those years of hard work and low pay only to be making $40k-$50k/year again after a decade. That just seems like too much effort for what I was getting before. Demoralizing to say the least.  


Now that I'm just trying to strictly focus on doing pilot training as a hobby, the biggest thing that comes to mind is my own past struggles with my truck driving career. No accidents or anything like that in the past, nine years. But when I first started doing this job after getting my CDL in 2004 at 21, I wasn't perfect by any means. The first couple of months I took out tree branches when I turned into a hotel parking lot due to missing a turn. Then after returning to it again in 2006-2007, I got fourteen months in at a relatively infamous company that gets slammed quite often. I was having trouble backing in and hitting things. Tearing off doors, getting lost, and in October 2007, fell asleep behind the wheel after over-exerting myself exercising earlier during the day and rolled the truck. Totaled the truck, but I was physically okay. Nonetheless, I was fired over that and more or less blackballed from any reputable company for three years.   


During those three years before I got back into a reputable company, I drove for some ""fly-by-night"" outfits with shifty equipment and owners. And when those folded, went back into security guard work for the remainder of the years before Nov 2010 when I found a company that would give me a shot after three years fell off.  


With the previously mentioned series of accidents before I ""got good"" at trucking, it makes me question again if flight school, helicopter or fixed wing, will be a death sentence for me? Seeing as how I had to screw up royally to correct myself in truck driving, I fear going through the same trials and errors while learning to and after learning to fly. Barely making the cut through the flight school(barely made the cut through truck driver training) and having a series of mishaps with whatever aircraft I'm flying in while working out all my kinks. Of course with aircraft, helicopter or fixed wing, you crash one of those into the ground, there's a higher chance that one will never learn from it because that could be the only mistake.  


It's something I keep telling myself I want to do. But now based on my own troubled past with my current career, I feel as though I'm forcing myself into a death march. Of course if that is the case and I don't pursue, I really don't have any passion for any other career or other pursuits in life for that matter. It's like this flight school thing which may or may not end up ending me is the only thing I seem to have any sort of conviction to do."
212,Feeling Alone,"Hi! I'm not sure if this is the right place but I was wondering if I could get some help.

I've suffered from depression almost my whole life. For as long as I can remember I've always been troubled. This may be a shot in the dark, but I think a lot of my depression stems from my feeling of always being alone/feeling disconnected from people/experiences (obviously there are other causes too for me). I don't really need any advice like you just need to find your people etc. I have them. I have fulfilling friendships and friends who reach out to me if I seem to be in a funk and people who genuinely care, family members who I know if I opened up more would support me in the ways they know how and although I'm single, I've never really had any considerable lack of people interested in me etc. And I've seen that the relationships I've been offered have come from a place of genuine goodness and those that didn't work out still had genuine feelings there. I'm the kind of person that when others get close to me they've said things like they've never felt a connection like we have etc. But although I love them dearly and deeply, a part of me is so disconnected that when we're together all I can feel is the transcience of it all. The fleetingness of the moment we share, so that no matter how beautiful or magical the moment I'm present in is, I still feel it slipping away and it leaves me feeling so alone. I think this is a major cause for my depression, as I can't seem to feel connected to anything fully, whether it's people or places or achievements. Hence leaving me feeling like everything is a bit pointless.

I've tried to practice mindfulness so that I can be more present and not have my thoughts wander to how this will all end but it doesn't really work for me as well as I hoped it would. So I wanted to get opinions and maybe resources about where this sort of thinking takes its roots, whether from research or from your own experience of feeling something similar. I suspect it's some type of abandonment thing, maybe? 

To give context, some of my earliest memories (as young as around 3 years old) involve me thinking about how everything will leave me eventually and I'm not sure where I could have picked up this type of mentality when I can't remember farther back than those memories or remember anything that may have caused feelings of abandonment at *that* age."
213,Has my mental health affected my intelligence?,"From a young age I have suffered with depression and severe anxiety. However, I loved school, I loved to learn and find new things. After a horrid strong of events, abuse and bullying, I attempted suicide at 9. 
Ever since that event I feel as though my mental health has become all I am. 
Im now 23. 
Im at university. 
But for the past few years I have struggled to know things. I havent been able to remember academic things. Frankly it feels like I never went to school. 
In 2016 I developed agorapgobia...and then I didnt go outside for 3 years. However, during this time I studied constantly. 
I dont know whether this is trauma induced or whether im just plain stupid. It breaks my heart. Because it feels like all I am is my anxiety. All I am is a psychiatric disorder. 
Does anyone else feel as though their mental health has done this to them?? Has my mental health affected my intelligence???"
214,"Letting someone not commit suicide because they wanna stay alive for someone else is different from guilt tripping them into staying alive because ""there are people that love them""","I see mental health posts a lot talking about how we shouldn't ever guilt trip a suicidal person into staying alive because ""what about those that love you?"" because this would make them feel like more like a burden for even feeling the way they do.  There are also those who value self-love so much who say ""when you think about not ending your life, I hope you do it for yourself. I agree to certain extents. However there are people (and I'll have to admit, I used to be one of them til recently) that take these notions to the point that when someone says that the only reason they don't want to commit suicide is because they *personally* don't want to see the grief they'll put their loved ones through or they don't want to leave them alone or basically any reason that isn't for them, they are unsatisfied with the response and expect something more like ""because I personally believe that things will get better"" or ""because i want to think about myself"". 

But let's be real here, people who have ever tried suicide never immediately thought those things. 

I don't agree with them now because I thought that saying things like ""please live for yourself from now on""   right after someone who so badly wanted to die STAYED in this world sounds really demeaning. It's demeaning because imagine finding a reason to live, a reason to stay– but people will tell you ""oh yeah thank god you stayed but you're staying for the wrong reasons"". You'd feel even more like you're living life the wrong way, and even in staying alive you're given an expectation that you are just not capable of meeting for the time being. 

Even though they're different, making someone feel guilty for staying alive for the wrong reasons is JUST as bad as guilt-tripping someone into choosing not to die. 

These people already have seen their purpose, no matter how small, trivial or cliché, a reason to live is a reason to live. They want to stay alive because their favorite manga is yet to be adapted into an anime? Let them. They want to stay alive because they feel a sense of duty towards family members / friends? Let them. They want to stay alive because they don't want their dog to wonder where they went when they go? Let them. Let people live a life that will make them feel accomplished– like they've fulfilled their purpose and met their OWN expectations. These people can love themselves along the way, or find an even bigger purpose as they keep fulfilling the ones that keep them alive."
215,I’m wondering if I’m actually depressed or if there’s something else going on,"Im mainly writing this to vent because Im just so sick of this. 

Im 22F and have been depressed on and off for about 9 years, diagnosed and on antidepressants for 7. However, lately (the last 2-3 years) Im a very happy person for someone who is depressed, if that makes sense? Sometimes the depression is so bad I can’t get out of bed and it physically hurts, but other times I’m so happy I want to cry and have to scream into my hands to release the energy building inside me. It tends to come in phases, like I’ll be happy for maybe 2 weeks and then depressed again for 2 weeks, etc. Sometimes I have shorter periods like I’ll be really sad and hopeless for just a few hours and then I’ll be happy again but usually when it comes it stays for a long while. I had wonderful Xmas holidays, luckily, but the depression started again tonight. Hopefully it’ll just be a short one.

I know the description may sound a bit like bipolar disorder but I don’t think I fit the criteria because I don’t get intensely manic and do risky behaviour (except for impulse buying a fish once, which I know isn’t ideal but I like to think I gave her a good home. I also had unprotected sex in one of these moods). I read about bipolar 2 recently but tbh I still don’t know if I fit the criteria for that. It’s just so annoying that I either feel like dying or I feel like everything is absolutely incredible and I’m constantly smiling and feel like the world is magical.

I’m seeing a psychiatrist soon, but until then does anyone think they might know what on Earth is going on with me? I’m so sick of it. It’s hard because when I’m happy I know it will end but when I’m sad it feels like it never will.

Anyway thanks for reading, the vent helped a bit. Hope everyone had a good holiday!"
216,i went and saw outside for the first time in a month,i have black covers on my windows so i don’t have sunlight coming into my room and i am not able to see outside bc of the covers. all i’ve done for the past month is play chess and study at least 10hours a day. Finally saw outside and i honestly forgot how my area around my house looked.
217,Lying?,"I have a girl in my class who self-diagnosed herself with a mental illness. I have no problem with that since I did the same after having suicidal thoughts and self-harming. The girl said that she has anxiety. She always mentions it in every class. At some point, I started questioning her words. It almost felt like she was fishing for attention and sympathy. I wonder if she is lying? Also, would someone who has anxietybreally be comfortable talking about it in front of over 20 people?"
218,I'm proud of you!,"For so many, finding the strength to put one foot in front of the other each day is a monumental task. 

Some days were harder than others.
Some days were impossible.  
But here you are, another 365 days under your belt. 

Not only did you face your own personal battles and demons this year, but you did so during a stressful year of exhausting global conditions not seen in 100 years. You are incredible.

Pain and troubles and challenges aren't magically gone at the turning of the new year, but you have shown that you have the strength to keep pushing.

It doesn't matter if the effort it took to make it this far was pretty, there's no score. I'm so proud of you. Your strength, resilience, and determination are incredible. You are amazing. I hope you are proud of you too."
219,Need help,"I was sexually abused by my father for 4 years. I was only 11 when it started and I finally got away at 15. Recently I’ve been very down have bad headaches and crying my eyes out. I am often blamed for a lot in my mind it’s my fault so I’ll take it, I’ve always been told no excuses. How am I supposed to cope with this. I feel as if I’m going into a deep depression that I will not be able to get back out of. Any skills or help"
220,I'm starting to see things.,"I have been dealing with a lot of stress and a feeling of emptiness / hopelessness, I thinks its takin its toll on my mind and I'm starting to see apparitions of weird creatures  of what causes these feelings. When I was 13 my sister was born, she has been very stressful and screams a lot, she is now 3 and Is still not getting better. I get so angry when she cries. This constant screaming has given me constant headaches and trouble sleeping, I sometimes make out her cries from random sounds when she is not around. The cries also stop me from doing ""personal things"", as its hard to do it while accompanied by the cries of a baby.

I also have a cat which no one but myself looks after, I think she's over 12 years old and at the end of her life. I'm the only person that looks after her and she's been living in my room for a long time now, I feed her and make sure she is not lonely because my family hates cats and will not get another.  I don't get any credit for looking after her because apparently she belongs to my sister (my sister that's 14 yeas old), because cats are girl pets, Sometimes she goes out for a day or more and I get scared that she won't come back.  

The weird creature hallucination I see looks like a baby with cat legs and cat eyes, and appears in the edge of my field of view whenever I forget about it.  Sometimes it is in the mirror when I'm about to shower and sometimes it's under my desk crawling up to me when I'm on my computer.

I know that if I tell my parents about it they will blame it on my computer, phone, or console as they are both teaches and are extremely against these things (especially phones). To cope with the feelings I listen to post rock music and grimes. I like to play death stranding when the feelings get strong as it is peaceful and makes me forget about reality. I barely eat food and I think that may be why I'm more prone to headaches ( but I do drink only water and lots of it) I try to eat more food but my stomach can't hold much.

 Is there anything else I can do to help with the hallucinations as they are only just beginning and I don't want them to get worse as I know what these can do to people."

222,im a failure i want to end it,"my parents had such high apsirations of me and ive ruined my life because i gave in to social anxiety and depression i wish i was dead, i cant stop shaking and crying thinking about it right now fuck i dont know what to do, i always told myself i will go back to education when im better now 7 years later, ive not only lost motivation i also forgot all my knowledge, and feel so intimidated trying to pick up where i left of im just doomed, my parents dont say it to me but i know its the truth , i just want to apologise to them and end it"
223,Worried,"I’m kind of worried about my mental health...I’m beginning to obsessively view astrology, and focus on bad traits of myself... how I may be a narcissist or how I am selfish in conversations.  A lot of shame and guilt is coming up.
Does anyone have advice for this?  I am searching for a therapist"
224,I feel sick.,"I just cut myself for the third time, and I felt so nauseous and dizzy right after, I don’t know if it was the sight of blood or what it was but I’m laying down and I’m just really dizzy. I don’t know what to do, I’m feeling so addicted to the knife, I think about it every day and I can’t help myself. What do I do?"
225,"Hey, that’s me! And on top of that! I’m an introverted, shy, awkward, self hating, depressed, over worked, over stressed teenager! YAY!","What are psychological and emotional signs of stress?

Depression or anxiety.

Anger, irritability, or restlessness.

Feeling overwhelmed, unmotivated, or unfocused.

Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much.

Racing thoughts or constant worry.

Problems with your memory or concentration.

Making bad decisions."
226,Friendship question. Not sure if this is the place to post.,"Let me start off by saying that I am not jealous. As in I never feel like I’m going to be replaced or anything but I get for lack of a better word “ jealous” when my friends has other close friends( even in the past) EX: let’s say they used to be best friends with someone for 5 years. Then they stop because of a falling out or they moved away. Now here comes me I meet this person and we become friends. It makes me sick to my stomach to even think about the past friendship because I don’t like the fact that they even had that close bond to begin with. Even if I have that same bond. It really bugs me. If they had sleepovers and we never did. It makes me upset. If they went to the carnival together and even though I hate carnivals and would not want to go I still don’t like the fact that they went. What’s wrong with me. Please I need answers or if anyone has anything similar. This person is out of the picture. I don’t have to worry about them. I’m not jealous of them I don’t want to be them so why does even knowing about it upset me. 

If I had to point it out to something MAYBE I get upset that they might deep down, even though they will never be friends with that person again, prefer that friendship over ours. That’s might be a reason but still. Why am I like this."
227,Anyone else worry if things are good?,"Does anyone else for some reason feel guilty about anything good in your life and almost feel like you don’t deserve it? 

It’s almost like my mind will say ‘because you have this one thing in life, you can’t have this other thing so don’t expect that’? 

Or for guilty for having good times or anything positive in life?"
228,"I've never had anxiety like this before. I don't want to kill myself, but I want it to end.","I've always been an anxious person, but the past couple months have been like nothing I've ever expirienced before.

It started when I had a weekend of pure panic. Nothing could make me feel better. All my usual comforts and constants did nothing to help. I've since gotten a little better where I can function, but the smallest things set me off. We got a new calendar for the new year and for some reason looking at it made me break down. My friend called me, and during the converstion, I had to just hang up and blame getting disconnected. I see just something random in my house and it throws my brain for a loop. 

I absolutely don't want to die, but sometimes I feel like it would be easier than this suffering. I've been seeing a therapist once a week, but it is not enough. It's all I can afford right now though. I don't know what to do. My wife wants to help, but I don't see how she can. I want this to end. Has anyone else ever felt this way? I just want to talk. Please."
229,Need telepsychiatry,Hi everyone I was just wondering if anybody had any experience with some of these telepsychiatry sites. I have OCD depression PTSD and add and I do need prescribed controlled substances and I just was wondering if anybody could help me find a doctor or any website that can prescribe Adderall and Xanax XR and also I need a therapist but I'm going to try to use my Medicare for that so I really appreciate anybody's input and God bless and happy New Year😀
230,What to do when I don't even feel like living?,"(not s*icidal, I don't think. I just feel nothing today again)"
231,Why did I just sense impending doom and dread for a decasecond?,.
232,Uh wtf,"Not me refusing to stand up my wooden toy because the rod would hurt it-

Not me moving my stuffed animals legs so the blood doesnt flow to its legs and give them pins and needles- 

Not me petting my hedgehog mug because it looked lonely-

Tf is wrong with me LMAO"
233,I hate being touched as a result of sexual abuse as a kid. How can I deal with it?,"I just really don't like being touched randomly even by people i trust like my mom or my niece. It just triggers me and I gotta hold back to not flinch or punch the one who touches me. It's super annoying and people start wondering why I'm so on edge. 
I made some progress, I can handle people randomly bumping into me and stuff but its still distressing, especially when I'm in a relaxed setting.
Example: when I sit on the couch with my parents and I stand up to get something, my mom often holds me back for some reason, grabbing my shoulder or putting her arm in front of me so I can't stand up. It's just makes me super angry and I hate it and sometimes I just instinctively slap her arm away which of course leads to a big argument about respect. 
I hate myself for being such a wimp but I can't help it. 
Part of the problem might be that i never told my family about what happened and generally have a strained relationship with them. 
Surprisingly, i can stand contact with my best friend without too much difficulty but only for a limited time. I just don't understand why this is and I want to be normal again. Any advice?"
234,Mental Health Podcast,"Hey! As I'm sure with many of you on this board, I've been through the wringer with mental health. 

After my last bout with it, I decided to create a mental health podcast to try and help others and share information that helped me. 

It's called Mindfulness With Christ. Yes, it's Christian based but I think believers and non-believers alike can enjoy this. Typically my episodes have featured agnostics, Jewish, and undetermined beliefs of guests haha 

On my show, I've had an OCD specialist, aromatherapist, a nutrition and health coach from Harvard, a therapist that specializes in depression, a drug recovery story, and so on. 

I only have 5 episodes up but I have multiple episodes locked and ready to upload once a week on Tuesdays! 

This is literally just a passion project, I've put hours and hours into editing, cold calls, creating designs, recording, scheduling, learning new software, and not to mention monthly fees for podcast memberships. The only thing ""I get out of this"" ( I only say this bc I know the internet is full of salespeople and scammy things) is hopefully being able to help someone know that they're not alone in their struggles, there is hope and that CAN get better. This includes you if you're reading this. 

My podcast Bio: 

Mental health is super important but often goes overlooked, underresourced, and misrepresented. This podcast is a place where you can learn more about topics such as OCD, depression, anxiety, mindfulness, and more all in the comfort of wherever you choose. In this podcast, we respect everyone's beliefs regardless of if you are a Christian or not. I encourage you to give this a listen and if not my podcast then just any podcast that will help you on your mental health journey. I know things can get intense and scary, but you CAN get past this, regardless of how endless your struggle may feel. All the best, MWC.It's on Apple Podcast, Spotify, YouTube, Iheart Radio, and Pandora.

235,how can i get my mom help?,"hi idk if this is the group to ask this in but i hope it is lol also i’m sorry if i made any grammar mistakes i’m just rlly upset rn

everyone in my family has mental health issues, but we’re all medicated and getting the help we need except my mom. she takes everything we say as an attack and it’s very clear that she has mental health issues and it’s bringing all of us down too. we can’t have a happy home because our mom won’t get any help and continues to think that she’s above everyone else. she calls us all “dysfunctional” and refuses to acknowledge that depression and anxiety are real, which is hard because i have severe social and general anxiety. today, my older sister and i tried to have an intervention with her, and we were both calm and non-confrontational with her, but she ended up getting angry and calling us both ungrateful. i just don’t know how to get her the help she needs because i love my mom but it’s getting so hard to live with her. every year it gets worse and worse and it makes my mental health even worse too. does anyone have any advice? i’ll take anything because at this point i’m desperate."
236,Anexiety worsened night after drinking,"My anexiety worsened  the night following the hangover. Basically I managed okay during the day with just minor anexiety.

237,21 Small Ways To Take Care Of Your Mental Health In 2021,"We can all agree that 2020 was a particularly taxing year, but for those of us who were already dealing with mental health struggles, it was especially rough. We’re all ready for 2021, of course, but when you’re feeling like the weight of the world is just too much, embarking on a new adventure feels more daunting than exciting. That’s why it’s important to consider a few key mental health tips as we look to the year ahead—prioritizing your well-being is essential to thriving, and you’ve totally got this.

There are all different kinds of mental health struggles people deal with on the reg, some of which are more debilitating than others. A moment of stress is not the same as an intense, anxiety-induced panic attack, and a quick cry doesn’t compare to the weight of clinical depression. Sometimes, your struggles can be cured by a good vent sesh, a long walk or a cuddle with your pet; others require therapy and even prescribed medications. Everyone is different, and we all have different needs, but all of our feelings are valid, and we can all take steps to overcome our struggles in the year ahead.

Below, find 21 ways to improve your mental health in 2021. Some are small—keep a gratitude list, tell a friend you love them—while others are more intense, from cutting out toxic people to consulting your doctor for medication. I won’t pretend a glass of water can cure your lifelong anxiety; these are simply small ways to make each day a bit more bearable, so you can enjoy the life you deserve.

238,A Conspiracy Against me,"I have recently come to the terrible realization that there is a conspiracy against me. The way people talk/talked to me, looked at me and acted different when I am around. But on new years eve my friend came up to stay and my ""friends"" from high school were having a party. I hadn't seen them for a while so I was excited too. My friend asked if I could go to the party

They said yes but...I think 3 people messaged him and said they are not sure about me coming. They said to him preposterous lies and slander which really hurt me. No doubt they have told these lies to other people and thats why they act different around me.    


It is now confirmed that there is a conspiracy against me to belittle me and work against me. I have no idea how wide and how many people are involved in this. I know a few people that are central to it now.  What do I do? I feel like I need to strike back they are trying to ruin my life! a whole group of people spreading false information, excluding and working against me gets to my head"
239,Friendships with the opposite gender,"I have never had a completely platonic (from my side) relationship , for some reason whenever I get a friend of the opposite sex I eventually open up to them on ways I don't with my same sex and as a result I grow attached ,I eventually start looking them. I really would like to have platonic relationships it would be much better than what I currently going to"
240,Anyone else on here who keeps creating unhealthy obsessions and then has a mental breakdown over it??,"I know this must have something to do with my mental illness, I just can't say where exactly the connection is... 

For me it usually happens with game characters or characters from a series /movie. It's often one with a tragic story, or with an unfair burden or something like that. I've been doing this for around five years now I believe. It usually starts with an interest about the background of, let's say, an video game character. I get into more detail, get further into the fandom and - bam. It happens again. I get completely obsessed with them, spend my complete free time watching pictures of them, reading Fanfiction, watching fan-made videos... literally waking up thinking about them and getting to sleep with them as my last thought - they're always on my mind, even keeping me from doing my work and basic tasks at home. I pretty much completely isolate during these ""phases"" as well. This goes on for days, sometimes weeks until I have a mental breakdown over the fact that they don't exist. Then it's over until I get back to it again. It's nothing sexual or attraction, I don't ""weeb"" over them or whatever...I just... kind of want to be them I guess? Or want them alive. Idk if that sounds weird but that's just how it is. Hard to explain but I think it's one of these two possibilities. 

However it's come to a point where I just don't want this anymore. I want to get into a topic without risking getting completely obsessed and depressed in the aftermath. I feel so out of control when it happens, I lose track of time, forget about what I did all day, miss appointments - only because I'm so wrapped up in my obsession. I tried cutting out all triggers, deleted all games and didn't watch any more stuff that I KNOW will trigger this obsession again... But sometimes I just can't stop myself. It feels so great, I mean who doesn't like endulging in fantasy? It also happens very quickly when I get into a ""new"" obsession from a new series I watch for example. I often get back to old obsessions sooner or later, but it's hard getting myself to stop when it's an obsession I never had before. Its all new and exciting then, plus I never know that it's gonna happen beforehand. 

But I know it's unhealthy and I need to stop before I completely lose sense of what's real and what's not. Even tho I know it very well right now, it scares me sometimes how much these obsessions impact my life. It also doesn't get me anywhere, I just get so depressed and wrapped up in my head that I'm not having fun in the end, and having a mental breakdown every time I snap out if it isn't helping either. It worsens my mental health a lot, but at the same time feels so comforting. 

Anyone feeling the same?? I can't be alone can I?"
241,I can’t enjoy small things in life. What do I do?,"I’m a 19 y.o guy currently studying in a film school In Berlin. I feel guilty writting about this, becuase I really shouldn’t be feeling sad since everything in my life looks great - I’m healthy, my family’s healthy, I live in a nice city, etc. 

But still, if anything I’m gonna write this so at least someone can tell me I’m being sad for no reason. 

Basically I don’t understand what can I enjoy in regular day-to-day life. I have just a few things in life that make me happy - travelling and landscape photography. Both of these things are something you can’t do very often. The problem is that unlike most other people I don’t get any happiness from small things in life. Like when I’m just living a regular life studying I can go weeks without feeling a glint of happiness. 

I might have some form of social anxiety because I hate doing anything around a lot of people, meaning I don’t do most of the things my classmates enjoy - partying, going out, etc. 

I might have way too high expectations of what a happy day looks like, but for me personally if I spend a whole day studying, eating, sleeping and watching YouTube that’s a shit day. And I can’t find a way to enjoy small things like a walk from the metro or a nice dinner, or whatever normal people enjoy"
242,I'm terrified my friend will try to kill himself,"My long-distance friend of many years is in the midst of a deep mental health slump. He told me recently he's currently on a sort of 'house arrest', essentially a suicide watch by his family, because he almost attempted suicide. I know he doesn't want to go back to a hospital, but I'm terrified that it won't be enough.

The worst part is that he lives in a different state than me, and if he does do something, I'll be completely powerless to help. I don't know what to do to make it better, or if there's anything I CAN do, aside from offering a voice of support.

I've been talking down suicidal friends since I was 15, and you'd think it'd get easier, but it never does. I have yet to actually lose someone, but the thought is in the back of my mind 24/7. It's ramping up my anxiety so badly that the meds don't seem to help anymore. The worst part is that he's just so quiet about the whole thing; I won't know what he's about to do until it's too late. What do I do? How do I help him?"
243,Why should I bother?,"I'm stuck in a perpetual day that started way before 2020. I've done all I can think of to break the cycle, and I find myself asking myself 'Why?' a lot. 

If regardless of my goals or efforts, I still see no changes, why should I continue trying?

If my life is going to remain as static as it is now, what point is there?

I have fun, but it always ends up being a momentary distraction. I've tried therapy with no success, medication isn't doing anything at this point. I've been going in loops for months, and while I have no concern for my safety... I can't imagine living like this long term.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what I'm looking for here. Is it motivation? For someone to point out a fatal flaw? A solution to fix me? I'm sick of meaningless advice and useless confidence boosters that I see so often. I just want to live life normally, and perhaps that is too much."
244,How do I ask for help with out saying anything specific.,"The title prob sounds stupid but I need some advice on something. About two weeks ago my mum, step dad and sister found out about me self harming and that I was having suicidal thoughts. Since then my suicidal thoughts have gotten far far worse and I’m scared. (I’ve got somewhat detailed plans and a date) 
I know I need to say something to someone but I don’t know how. If I say things as a they are I’m scared I’ll be sent to some psych ward but I also know that it’s probably not great for my family if I do end up going through with it. How do I ask for help?
Any advice helps. Thanks"
245,Am I a bad person because I don't want to be a healthcare worker,"TW: suicidal thoughts 

I am a freshmen in college. I am currently majoring in art, because that's what I always wanted to major in, but now I feel like I'm a bad person because of it. Of course this doesn't make any sense, I don't know why I feel like this, but especially since the virus started when I was still a senior in high school, I started thinking that I need to change my major to become a doctor or a nurse or some other healthcare thing or else I deserve to die. I've felt like this before the virus, but in different ways, like for a long time and still now I feel like I can never ask for medical help even if I can afford it/need it unless I'm also a healthcare worker. It's part of the reason why I feel like I can never go to therapy. I think I can only go to therapy if I'm also a therapist, which is also why I've considered changing my major to psychology. But especially now, I've been completely frantic about becoming an EMT or changing my major to biology/psychology (which I know I actually don't want to do) or volunteering at a COVID testing site (even though I can't, because I live with my high-risk parents) because if I don't do these things then I deserve to die. I can't imagine a future as a doctor or a nurse, and I've never really been interested in a career like that, but if I'm not a healthcare worker then I should be dead. I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like a waste of space. I don't know what to do anymore."
246,Do I have social anxiety disorder?,"Hi everyone. I’m a 19 year old guy. I wanted to ask this here because I literally don’t have anyone else to turn to. I’d you could read through this and give me even a short advise that would be so lovely of you.

Basically, to put it short for the last couple of years I’ve been having signs of really really severe social anxiety, however there are some other things that don’t quite add up. Also because I grew up in a very conservative family where mental health is not discussed at all, Im very portly educated on it, so I’d appreciate any help.

I’m very scared of any kind of human interaction to the point where it becomes really stupid. My dad always makes fun of me for this because a lot of the simple tasks he asks me to do seem incredibly hard for me. Here’s some examples of situations I have:

- I hate taking public transport because I feel like everyone in the tram is looking at me. I feel on edge, adjust my clothes a lot because I feel like something about me looks silly or funny. 

- I’m really nervous when using the public washroom in my apartment because I’m scared of someone walking in when I’m there, seeing me and thinking I’m stupid for doing the washing wrong or whatever.

- I’m really nervous when interacting with people from banks or government agencies. Especially when it’s something I’m doing for the first time like getting my driving license or registering a new address. 

- and lastly the silliest example... I’m really scared that the same food delivery driver will show up to my door 2 times in a row. This is super silly. I guess it’s because In my head I think that the delivery guy is thinking “oh this fat idiot ordered food twice today.”


Now even though these examples may make it seem like I have something severe, there are also a couple examples I have that disprove that I have anything wrong with me:

1. I wasn’t always like this. Mainly I’ve been feeling like this for the last 3 years since I was 16. I was always a shy teenager growing up, but I never had them this bad. Also for the 1 year period (15-16) when I had my first and only relationship with a girl I was super confident and did stuff that the current me couldn’t even imagine doing. For example I vlogged my trip to Iceland, but today I can’t even imagine how scared I’d be to talk into the camera in front of people.

2. Very rarely I can still do something that goes against what a social anxious person could do. For example on my graduation ball last year I was the only one who did a little bit of a longer introduction walk to the stage, I stopped in the middle and waved to my mum while everyone else would just walk straight. I was really nervous, but I still did it. Surely a person with real social anxiety can’t do that?

So yeah this is my situation, I doubt anyone made it all the way to here... I don’t really know what to do. This problem influences my life to a huge extent, but I’m worried about going to a professional about this. I’m worried because no matter what they tell me I think it will be bad for me:
1. If I get told I don’t have social anxiety then I’ll feel like a bitch for complaining while not actually having any mental condition.
2. If I get told I do have social anxiety I feel like it’ll ruin me as a person since I’ll just use that as an excuse to not do anything at all. 

Also as you can probably guess, I feel anxios about going to a professional who could help with my anxiety. What a closed loop that is."
247,How do I tell someone I no longer want to be their friend,"Title. I am struggling with this a lot. I have been friends with someone I met online for a while and we quickly became good friends, but I think it evolved into a toxic relationship and now every time I talk to them I get really anxious. I really want to end the friendship but 

1. I know they would make it a big deal and probably would be depressed for a long time

2. I don’t really want to be inconsiderate and I think the friendship started off really well 

3. I get anxious talking to them at all and I’m afraid to even bring the topic up because I don’t want to text them. 

Also, I recently had another, other online friend who was really important to me ghost me. I told this friend about this and they kind of obsessed over it in a really creepy way that I felt violated my friend’s and my own privacy. These two people have spoken to each other in the past and I’m afraid they might come in contact in the future and talk about me which causes me a lot of anxiety. I feel guilty for even mentioning the friend to them at all. 

At this point I really want to end the friendship but I need advice. I don’t know how to bring it up without it being dramatic/awkward. They also follow me on a few sites online that I can’t block them on. It’s giving me so much anxiety that I can’t really think about anything else and I’d really like some insight 

Thanks"
248,I’m struggling,"Last year, i was diagnosed with an ED. I would go days without eating but would just constantly work out. If i ate even the smallest of things i’d feel so bad, i’d go the next four days without eating a single thing. For a while, i’ve been doing good with eating regularly but today when i was trying on clothes i had a breakdown and i’ve only eaten two apples today. I’m afraid that i am spiraling. I don’t know what to do."
249,I don't have anything to live for in 2021,"My friends won't talk to me, my family is nuts. I don't see the brighter light of myself and I really feel like I just wanna die...

I'm so fucking lonely it hurts, I go to school yet I don't feel anything anymore since quarantine fucked it all up. My mom thinks ThErApIsT bAd cause they say the same thing and talk, she refuses to let me get help, and yet she needs help. I love my mom but my family has gone downhill, I'm too lazy to put out simple personal shit cause I know some of you will be like fuck it and scroll.

My brain won't let me kill myself cause every time I do it, I know it's going to suck ass. I'm fucking exhausted of myself and I really don't see the purpose of living, I try but every time I try it fucking sucks.

And having autism is an additional fecal matter to this fucking chaotic puzzle piece that I'm trying to fix, I've transferred so many schools because the teachers kept touching me because I wasn't acting right of my short-fused temper, some of them gave me bruises. I quitted my meds many years ago and became better and got myself an actual friend, but when 2020 hit, things didn't hit the same as the conversation became duller and duller and I feel like I'm not a person anymore, I quit trying and when I try it's just not worth it.

If God is trying to send me a message about learning about human life THEN FUCKING SEND ME THE MESSAGE.

I'm tired of living and I'm only 17... I'm hoping to god when I turn 18 things don't go shit....

I'm really tired, I just want to be happy, not fucking suffer"
250,I’d fear of missing out syndrome a real thing?,"I have had this toxic mentality since I got to college, and it’s really starting to affect me. If I hear that there I a party of an event I feel like I have to be there. If I’m not there I feel like I’m lame and I’m missing out. It get so bad sometimes that I’ll cry myself to sleep thinking I’m a loser.

Tonight there is party “to start off the new year right”. I have a friend to go with and I could go but, I honestly don’t want to. I’m tired and I just want to sit and relax. But my mind keeps telling me I should go. “It’ll be fun” “you’re going to miss out”. How do I get this to stop. I’m tired of the anxiety and I’m tired of feeling like a loser if I don’t go.

Any help is much appreciated!!"
251,Mother is slipping into insanity,"I suspect that my mother starting to suffer from dementia. For some background context, my mother hates her mother-in-law with all her existence (it is somewhat justified because the MIL has done some shitty stuff to my mother). As a result, my grandmother is living with my uncle for the past several years with little interactions between the two.
However, the past year, my mother's mental health has been slipping. She's stuck in a loop where if you mention her MIL (in an immediate family setting), she will insult my grandmother for the whole day. That is fine except she would start attacking my father and then me since we are related to my grandmother. She keeps an excellent facade in front of others, pretending that everything is fine and says ""the past is the past.""
Now, there is barely a day that passes where my mother does not insult my grandmother. I make a mistake? She blames the bad habits are a genetic fault from the grandmother and will not shut up and will keep insulting the hell out of everyone such as my father and me. You cannot reason with her. Her hatred for my grandmother has basically taken over her life and she keeps repeating all the things that my grandmother has done that wronged her in her head. The thing is, she has not made ANY contact with MIL for OVER 2 YEARS but things are just getting worse.
Mother refuses to admit anything is wrong and says everyone is siding with my grandmother when we tell her to let it go (we just want her to stop talking so that we can have some peace in the house). Everyone is literally at their mental breaking point. 
I really want to get my mother see a doctor, especially since her memories are getting worse too. However, a few years ago, she was taken to the hospital and seen by a psychiatrist (long story) and they said she was perfectly fine. She is able to control herself in public so there is no way for her doctor to find out unless I tell him explicitly. However, there is no way for me to do that without her finding out and not destroying me. I'm on the verge of finding the needed drug and slipping it into her food (I know it's illegal, but that is how mentally exhausted I am). Any suggestions? 

P.S. (I cannot move out on my own since I am still in school. Plus, that would just be a bandaid on the solution since my father will have to still suffer)


TLDR: My mother's hatred for her MIL is taking over her life to the point that she is insulting everyone related to the MIL, including me. Any help on how to relay her mental health to her doctor or getting the right medicine?"
252,Just me venting,"I want to preface this by saying i have no clue why i feel this way, its entirely explainable. I've lived a good life so far. I've never had to deal with any kind of sexual or physical abuse nor do I live in any sort of bad conditions, yet i find myself with the same feelings.

everyday feels the same, yet i expect it to be different. i have spent everyday of my winter break laying in my room with the lights off either watching anime or something on YouTube. I ask myself daily if i should go out, meet up with some friends, or just be anywhere besides my unkempt, muggy room. but yet even though i hate it in my room and i want nothing more than to do something else, for some reason i cant bring myself to do it, id rather just stay in my room.

its funny too cause i get these same feelings every time i go on break. my last several summer and winter breaks all felt like this. WHY?!?! it doesn't make sense. i work my ass off during the school year dealing with incompetent teachers and constant stress. all for my break to be spent being a lazy sack of shit in my room just as sad as i was before. my only theory for this is that during the school year, although it may be horrible, at the very least i'm preoccupied with school work, as apposed to having the time to feel sad, or something along those lines. I go back to school soon so hopefully this theory holds true. it would also make sense why i was so depressed last summer, I had issues with cutting and almost suicide, this might have had to do with the amount of time where i wasn't preoccupied with something. then when the school year started and I began to feel like my normal self again.

thankfully at least this time i picked up a new hobby (WARNING: its really nerdy). I found I really enjoy reading economic theory. it really interests me learning on the ethics and morality of different economic stances from different point of views. i found this to be a nice thing to do, but over time its become increasingly more difficult to pick up a book and read it. 

School starts up for me again in 3 days i hope my feelings don't impact me too much going into this semester.

(chances are i'm probably gonna make another post in about a week or two, seeing how the start of this semester goes)"
253,Postpartum and more,"My wife has Postpartum depression and bipolar I believe. She won't talk to me or her parents. She's been in the hospital since Christmas. She'll be there at least two more weeks. We have a 4 week old baby.

Doctors are putting her on Zyprexa after trying seroquel (which wasn't strong enough apparently). Does anyone have experience taking Zyprexa? I feel hopeless, this is terrifying, she is a completely different person. I hope someone can give me some advice on how to try to deal with this situation."
254,Hallucinations blocking entire vision,"I’m currently in a mental hospital and I hallucinate all day every day, but something new has happened. Numbers have been blocking my entire vision since a week ago, I can be sitting down on my phone and I suddenly get about 100 numbers which are a bit see-through (though, it still makes it impossible to see) blocking my vision. I’ve looked on the internet and it seems as nobody has experienced this type of visual hallucination before, it’s quite scary thinking about it because what if I’m riding a bike and numbers immediately start blocking my vision, causing me to crash? I told the health care assistants about it, but they’re just like “oh, ok” - I don’t know what to do."
255,I have no idea how to break the cycle.,"I don't have any friends, because I'm too anxious to go out, make friends and better myself, because I know I'm not a fun person to be around, because I'm depressed, because I don't have any friends because I'm too anxious to go out....."
256,Severely depressed,"I’m f (20) years old and I’m just giving up on life and trying to fix my mental health or at least manage it. I’ve had anxiety ever since I was nine, I noticed throughout the years it just worsens. I feel like I’m going out of my mind, and maybe I am. But basically I get this panic feeling like “nothing is real” especially in an environment I’m not used to or even in cars. It’s really preventing me from enjoying life and I’m young. 

And yes I’ve been to therapy but all they do is try to shove medications down my throat and brush me off/never talk to me again. 

I only left the house maybe 3 times in the past year, there is a pandemic I’m aware of but it’s not healthy for a person like me. I’ve become very paranoid of my own surroundings. And feel bad for my boyfriend who drives to see me , and we never go out like normal couples. Idk why he’s even still with me, I would give up on me too."
257,Yelling random words whenever I recall embarrassing memories or uncomfortable truths,"TL;DR : I yell or mutter random English words whenever I'm embarrassed or otherwise uncomfortable. Seeking any advice as to what this is.

So, whenever I remember something embarrassing thar I did in the past and/or any uncomfortable truths about myself (how I'm a slob, how I'm patchily going bald etc.), I yell out (when alone in my room) or mutter (when anyone is within earshot) random words. I'm not a native English speaker but I believe I have sufficient command over the language. So most of what shout or mutter under my breath is in English. I don't see any word association with the offending memory or truth I'm thinking of as it's unconnected and I see I use certain words very frequently. It's almost never anything vulgar.

Most common and reoccurring examples : Franco-prussian, Brack, Tenochtitclan (the ancient Aztec city, now Mexico city). 

These are the most commonly used.

I am also susceptible to very acute second-hand embarrassment. I can't make myself watch all the goofy videos of people slipping and falling or singing badly or heck even awkward situations in movies and series has me pausing the thing, and walking off muttering one of those words to cool down. Bojack Horseman was one of the worse offenders in this regard 😅 .

I'm also a bit depressed and don't think too much of myself. I idly think of suicide but I don't think I will ever actively consider it. I don't have many friends and I keep to myself in the workplace. I'm 32 years old and never had a girlfriend ( it honestly doesn't bother me much these days, I don't want to inflict myself upon any unfortunate soul ). All this info is not to garner any sympathy or comments but rather for if someone wants to attempt at guessing what's this random word spouting is about.

Physiologically speaking, I'm getting a belly these days but I used to keep very active in my teens and college years. Did some interschool level boxing. But I suffer from an early onset of rheumatoid arthritis. Started from random aches in my feet, moved on to full blown swollen joints whenever I walk or exercise a bit. So kinda living a sedentary lifestyle these days.

I searched around about this and found very few. I heard someone calling these words, 'wince words' and I liked the admittedly-apropos term enough that I believe it warranted a mention. 

So, in closing, I'd like to know whether or not this is some kind of symptom of an undiagnosed Tourette or something else. What do you guys think?"
258,Is there something wrong with me?,"Hi everyone, 
Not sure how long this is gonna be so if its an essay, bare with me. 
I am a paramedic student in canada. I am currently in the portion of my studies where I am working on ambulances and in the local ER, treating patients; basically I'm interning with the local paramedic service. Anyway, thats kind of irrelevant. The point is that I am new to paramedicine but I have been treating patients long enough that I have ""seen some shit"" as they say. Nothing too insane in comparison so some of my colleagues but the type of things that are unfortunately pretty commonplace in this line of work. Dead people, suicide attempts, that sort of thing. 
Anyway, the point of this post is that seeing these types of things has had no effect on me at all. Everytime I attend a ""rough"" call, I'm always asked, ""are you alright?"", ""if you need to talk to someone about this there are resources available"" etc. etc. and when I talk to my family or my friends that aren't in EMS, they all seem a bit shocked by how nonchalant or matter-of-fact I talk about that kind of stuff. I had also assumed that seeing the things you see in EMS would have more impact than it has so far.
Sooooooo, to get to my question. Is this normal or should I be feeling more emotion about these things? I was hoping that there would be people from the EMS community or mental health experts that would be able to give their professional opinions but I welcom anyone's two cents. 
Anyways, thanks for reading this far 🙂"
259,showed up at my best friends place after running away from home after having a fight with mum.,i’m so close to just fucking ending it y’all have no idea
260,I hit a mental block when I try to access memories.,"Not sure if this is the right sub; apologies if not. 

I (23F) have been struggling with mental health issues since I was a teenager. I have had negative/traumatic experiences, both in my childhood and adult life. I also have had limited knowledge and access to resources/information regarding mental health outside of what I can find online, and have only actively started trying to fix my mental health the past couple of years. Prior to that, I was not in a good position due to circumstances. 

Recently (in the past 6-12 months) a lot of small instances have happened that have highlighted just how bad my memory is; times when friends or family or my partner are sharing small anecdotes that I was a part of, but I have absoloutely no recollection of. Sometimes, these are things that have happened recently (within the past 1-2 years) and othertimes it's from within the past decade. 

Is this normal?? Not being able to easily access memories, even basic/recent events? 

I understand minds can be strong and wonderful things, and that we are able to suppress memories to protect ourselves, and I think such is the case for myself, unfortunately. But I think my mind is now unable to differentiate between the ""bad/hurtful"" memories from the ""good"" ones, and just does not let me access any of my memories, and I'm left wondering if that's so,  ""why"".. 

I also wonder if there is any way for me to be able to mentally unlock my mind and be able to access my memories again? Or if anyone else has had similair experiences, and how have they navigated this situation. 

Its frustrating and heart breaking to me  knowing that there are good moments full of love and happiness in my life I have experienced and am not able to remember. Unless someone I experienced it with brings it up, I feel like I have lost access to that memory, as well as many others. Guess the good thing is I don't even know what I can't remember lol...  

I can access a few random memories from when I was about 8-14 years old, but even then, I think it's only a small fraction of of what (I think) I should be able to recollect. Sometimes I can't even fully remember these memories, and only get random snippets of memories.

I fnd it difficult to try and make conscious recollections of things- even if I actively try to remember something that has happened recently, I can't. 

Usually I'm a very visual person, and can see memories play out like clips in my minds eye, but now (most times) when I try to remember, it's like I'm just hitting a blank wall. 

It makes me feel frustrated, and sad, and anxious, and I'd like to know if there is a light at the end of the tunnel, or should I work on accepting that I may never be able to access my memories in the same way again. I also worry that this may continue to get even worse over time.


TL;DR - I have real trouble consciously trying to access any of my memories (I think it's due to suppression from past traumatic experiences coupled with not looking after my mental health). Is there any way to fix my mind/memory access, or should I just accept it and move on?"
261,I don't remember how to not be lonely,"It's pretty much all I've known since I was about 12-13 (25 now). My parents &amp; older siblings never really took any interest in any of the things I was interested in. It was pretty much always either do what they want to do, or do things on my own. As for friendships, I've kind of always been the other friend. The one who would be invited to something last when a spot needed filling, or when someone mentioned something while I was around. I guess I've always had more acquaintances than friends. Never a best friend, that's for sure.

For as long as I can remember, whenever I've had to deal with something I've had to do it on my own, and I've gotten too good at it. Nowadays ,when I come across people who I think might actually care I don't know how to accept their help. I don't know how to share my interests or thoughts with other people. I don't know how to say, even to myself, that I'm not doing well without feeling whiney. I can't say I even know how to be a good friend, or a person that people want to be around."
262,Any mental exercising website?,"I know it exists because I've seen it has sponsored many youtubers, and it has like a subscription, but I can't remember the name, and I can't find it on google either. It's not skillshare by the way."
263,I feel empty,"I've forgotten how I look when I laugh. I've forgotten the last time I was happy. I tried things I could do to make myself happy, I convinced my parents to get me a laptop, because I thought since I loved learning programming and playing games that would make me happy but it didn't few days and back to feeling the same emptiness. I bought myself a ukulele using my savings thinking it would help but it didn't. I loved chess back when I was a kid, so thinking that would help I started playing chess again. But nothing helped I have a entrance coming up but I feel nothing. I remember having suicidal thoughts couple of months ago, I thought they were over now but those thoughts are coming back now. I can't find a way to be happy, I can't find a purpose, I just feel empty. I can't wake up on time, I can't sleep on time, I can do nothing. Everything is just messed up."
264,Did I make the right decision?,"My best friend is in love with me. But I don’t feel the same. He has depression but over time our friendship helped make him happier, etc. However, I’ve come to the conclusion that being in his life will only be hurting him in the long term because I don’t reciprocate his feelings. And if I meet someone, I know it would crush him. Was letting him go to help move on and focus on himself the right decision? I’m just scared that he’s going to do something to himself once we stop talking, but he understands this is not healthy for us to continue being friends with how he feels about me. I just hope im making the right decision."
265,Vent post,"TW: Mentions of SH (Punching myself) 


It a been about 6 months since I've told my mum about my mental health, that day she promised me she'd book me a doctors appointment (For my mental health to get it checked and all that) 6 months later I'm sat starring out my bedroom window at 3am in tears because I can't deal with all the mental and physical scars a carry with me ever day to the point it becomes overwhelming and swallows me whole so I become an anxious mess and freak out and lose my ability to see properly and it feels like my lungs are caving....I have a fear of telling her stuff I wanna keep between me and her because she just tells her gf, at this point the two things that are keeping me from loosing it is Anime and my beautiful girlfriend, I feel like I'm a danger to myself....I harm myself by punching my skull when I make small simple mistakes....I can't tell people this because they may sent me to a mental hospital, I wouldn't mind going to one....if I didn't have separation and attachment issues.....Sincerely- Olivia"

I feel abandoned by my team, because my caseworker acts like she wants people she doesn't have to do any work with, as in, yeah, your here, whoops doo. Not just her, but every place in this county. Been like that for almost 20 years now. I can't get the services I feel I need because it would mean more paperwork for them. Heck, her and her boss once tried to talk me into going into Adult Foster Care so they can make it easier on them. *Rolls eyes*"

270,[POSSIBLE TW - SELF HARM] didn't think scars last this long,"i was just brushing my teeth and, in the mirror, noticed a scar on my arm from this one night i burned myself with cigarettes.  the thing is, that was basically the one and only time i've ever self harmed.  the craziest part?  i still think that was a fun night and was actually glad to be reminded of it by that scar.  obviously burning yourself is a stupid thing to do but i did it like fifteen years ago during the wildest summer of my life.  

the night i did it i was drinking in the park with my dirtbag friends.  not 100% on how it happened, but i put a cigarette out on my arm just to be a badass.  because i was so wasted, i barely felt it.  in a way it actually felt really good.  without realizing the severity of these burns, i did it a few more times and then the rest of the summer had to wear long sleeves. 

fifteen years and this scar took my back to that one night and i can honestly say that i don't regret a damn thing."
271,General treatment info for bipolar I and II?," 

My friend was diagnosed with bipolar II from 2 psychiatrists and bipolar disorder I from one psychiatrist. He has been prescribed mood stabilizers and antidepressants, and has taken them for 2 weeks. He was major depressed a month ago, and improved up to now, but he says that his brain generally off and that hes not thinking (compared to when hes not depressed.)

He is anxious from a large variety of problems, doesn't really care about anything right now, often feels ""bad,"" sleeps more than usual (10hrs over night vs 8 hours when not depressed, and with multiple naps during the day,) and is far less productive at work than 2 months ago. He is kinda going in a downward spiral and doesn't really have a social support network other than with me.

One of the major stressors is that his wife wants a divorce, while he doesn't. He has a green card so his work visa might expire. I notice that the relationship is not that good because half a year ago he possibly went into a mild mania episode for a month and was very argumentative the whole time, causing problems with lots of his close friends. He is a good guy, its just that whatever mental problems that have surfaced has stressed his social relationships - in turn stressing him.

Could you point me in the direction of info that explains what common and effective treatments for bipolar disorder and depression are? It seems that he has only seen a psychiatrist so far, not a psychologist, and seeing a psychologist regularly is just as important. Are there good resources online or elsewhere for CBT exercises?

Do Psychiatrists tend to over diagnose patients with problems? He has been very productive at work and home up to around half a year ago, so would this mean that the current problem might not be bipolar disorder?"
272,Passive Aggressive Anger,How do people cope with passive aggressive anger?
273,Life and opinions or advice from anyone?,"So I’m a 15f and i can never stop myself from hurting myself, I try not to give in but my mind gets so overwhelming I have no other choice. I’ve tried opening up to my mom for help because I just can’t handle it anymore but she ignores it and acts like I never told her anything because she feels like she’s a horrible mother and guilt trips me. 

I have nobody else to go to so I have to deal with it on my own but I’m used to it by now because my mental health started getting worst when I was 9/10 I think. I’ve tried committing su!cide multiple times before but obviously they failed. I can’t see myself living past 20 I mean I basically failed at life anyways. 

Everyone in my family had high expectations for me as a child so now I just feel like a failure even more and think it’s best if I just die so I don’t disappoint them further. 

I guess cutting myself is the only way I relieve my mind and I can kinda calm down I have no other way of feeling better. I don’t have friends either because my mom took me out of school when I was in 7th grade but even then I hardly had friends. 

When she took me out of school she told me I’d get better and she’d help me with everything, but I was very wrong because she didn’t help me with anything she just ignored me and took care of my younger brother. So I basically dropped out of school. I don’t have a future at all how can I when I’m not even in school? 

Im always being blamed as well, everything is my fault in my parents eyes. I feel like a complete burden to everyone in my life. 

I’m even jealous of my younger brother he was raised so differently from me, he gets whatever he wants and treats my parents like their under him but they still love him and don’t discipline him at all.

I wish I could just feel loved for once in my life. I used to always try and live up to everyone’s standards and still try to but not as much.

I have so much to let out but this post is already quite long and I wouldn’t want people reading for that long. Btw sorry if I made any grammar mistakes"
274,Self Destructive Behavior,I'm a senior in high school and I just missed the deadline for two very important colleges. I don't know what to do and I've procrastinated so much on my other essays. How do I fix this? I don't know why I can't just sit down and do work. This happened with my Early Decision application too and I ended up getting deferred. I just want to kill myself. I feel like I'm doing all that I can and at the same time being a lazy piece of shit. I just want to be done with college. Everything is so shitty right now and I don't know what to do.
275,My past abusive relationship ruined me.,"My past abusive relationship left me ruined. I can't trust myself or other people anymore. I used to be happy and have so many friends. Now, I have none because I don't trust anyone. Everything hurts me. 

What do I do? How can I get through this? I also miss a lot of old friends that I lost while in the relationship. I want to reach out to them, but I am afraid they don't care for me anymore.

I'm tired of suffering and just want help. I want to feel like myself again and get my life back. I miss feeling happy and cared for by my friends and family."
276,My lady friend shared our text conversations with her therapist without my consent ...,"Is this ethical? We had gotten into an argument via text about a year ago and she just recently told me she went to a therapy session and shared our conversation with the therapist. I feel like this is a breach of trust. I don't know if the therapist requested to look at the conversation or if it was simply offered up. But now when I'm texting her I keep in the back of my mind that it may not be a private conversation. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? What are your thoughts?"
277,Sorry for the second post in a week,"I posted a couple days ago while really drunk, and I'm not too happy about it. However, while sadness/grief is not really a great flair, given Im more apathetic, I just want to feel something better. I feel like my life has become more pitiful since I've asked for advice. I appreciate the consoling and support that comes from it, but in a lot of ways I feel like I've spiraled my life out of control and rather than ask for the help when I need it, I ask when I'm drunk and really should just go to F****** bed, ya know? I'd never dream of suicide, but what kind of apathy-ridden hell is really worth riding out? If anyone has any suggestions I'd be happy to discuss it."
278,How to prioritize mental health financially,"I need some advice. 2020 has been kind of a crazy year for me. I’ve always had a few mental health issues that I wanted to get help for (anxiety, depression), and this year they’ve effected my life so much that i’ve finally decided to see a therapist about it. Only problem is, it’s kinda expensive. I tore my ACL this year so a lot of my medical expenses go towards physical therapy and paying off my surgery to repair it. I also am a fresh college graduate who wants to save up to get my own house and leave a bit of spending money to hang out with friends. Somehow I feel like paying that 50-100 dollars a session would really stretch me out thin, so i am considering putting it off until at least my medical expenses pay off. Only thing i’m worried about is being held back because i’m not getting better mental health wise. Should i be prioritizing mental health above other things (saving up for a home, time with friends, etc.)? Do you think it won’t hurt to hold off on it for a few more months? Is it worth investing in asap? Share your experiences could use the advice."
279,Coworkers blocked all my energy,"Essentially brainwashed me to the point where I can't see, process, or feel anything right. It's freaking scary, and I don't know how to get out. Can anyone, or anything, help?"
280,How to be that man?,"How can I be that man, that man that my family can be proud of, that kind of man people look up to, that kind of man that is lovable, the kind of man that you would be able to rely on, the kind of man that is brilliant and good looking, the kind of man that is talented, the kind of man that makes others feel safe around them... That kind of man that's not me..."
281,how do I stop binge eating?,"About 3 yrs ago I relapsed into an eating disorder and starved myself for about a year and a half. During that time i would watch videos of people binge eating/cheat days because it would make me disgusted (awful I know) and allow me to see others indulging in what I couldn’t have. It made me feel better about my situation of restricting almost every food out there. Except at a certain point I decided I’d try the “cheat day” and then I ended up spiraling I would tell myself “tomorrow I won’t eat anything”. Now 3 yrs later I can’t stop this process no matter how much I want to. I end up eating so much maybe about 3k calories and it can last up to 5 days then I’ll purge for however long and then the process starts all over again. I hate myself for it too and every-time it happens I get extremely depressed. But the thing is I’ve always used my weight and the food I eat as a coping mechanism for whenever I get depressed. It ends up making me even more depressed and I get so sick. I’ve had anorexia twice now in the past and I can say that after losing so much weight I never felt any happier. I don’t ask for advice from friends or family on this because it’s embarrassing. They would tell me they couldn’t help me and that I needed a therapist or something. I can’t get one and I don’t want to either But if anyone has some advice on other ways I can cope and also get over the binge/purging that would help me a lot. I do art, meditate, read, and exercise but whenever I get intrusive thoughts or overthinking these distractions/activities don’t help me at all. I just end up even more stressed and confused because I have no one to go to. I don’t know what to do anymore. I end up eating because somehow that’s the only thing that calms me down and I hate it because then I’m freaking out over how much I ate"
282,My (27yr) brother has a weed induced psychosis this week (first time) and he thinks we will be murdered. I can't stop crying,"I live with my brother, we are in our late 20's. He has been smoking weed on and off since his early teen years. Last Sunday, he got some weed (he sometimes smokes daily, sometimes doesn't for months). He didnt have any for about 6 weeks up until last Sunday. He smoked it at around 1pm, I went to work &amp; returned at 11.30pm &amp; he wasnt home, a knife on his bed &amp; it looked like he had run away but his phone was home. I thought it was strange but assumed he may have gone out to do late night street art.

The police knocked on my door at 1am &amp; stated they've taken him to hospital after finding him nearby having an episode, stating that I was kip napped &amp; murdered. All week he has been extremely delusional, thinks everyone outside wants to kill him, saying strange things like ""do you know anyone with a kiwi accent, i want to call them"", ""innocent people are going to die"" ""I havent done anything wrong, leave me alone"", begging me to pack up and go hide in the bush with him , convinced nursing staff tried to kill him.

It has been highly distressing. I can handle a lot but this is out of my depth. He is back in hospital for the third time this week but finally involuntary. If it was drug-induced, would he go back to normal soon when the weed fades out of his system or is this likely a long term thing? I am absolutely heartbroken. He has PTSD &amp; anxiety and he has been doing so well lately but this is so intense :("
283,"Bipolar.. Does he mean what he says when he's calm, or manic?","I've been with someone for 7 years now and have highly suspected he's bipolar but he doesn't have a formal diagnosis because he 'doesnt believe' in that kind of thing and doesn't believe he's mentally ill.   
  Anyway he's had some medical issues lately that have made him worse than he has ever been before.   
   
When he's calm, he loves me, doesn't want to lose me, feels terrible for the way he treated me before, and can be just a really sweet guy..   
 when he's being manic, I am worthless, a fat bitch, idiot, he's using me, has told me to go kill myself , told me he's disgusted by me etc etc etc.   
 It's been going on a lot more lately and when he's calm he is genuinely (I think) remorseful for the things he said or did but it's still messing with my mind.   
  Has anyone experienced/done this before? which side do I believe .. does he really love me or is he actually disgusted by me and using me (he doesnt have a lot of options right now as he is unemployed with no savings) ..  
 If anyone reading this is bipolar..do you lash out and say things you dont mean or, do you tend to have no filter and speak the truth in those moments?"
284,Clenching Theeth,"I have a huge issue with clenching my teeth due to my anxiety issues. I’m seriously struggling. Anyone have this issue? I tried using a mouth guard, but I just spit it out in my sleep. Anyone have a suggestion?"
285,auditory hallcinations,"i been hearing shit for awhile now, any type of hallcination you can had iv had it, astral projection, controlled hallcinations were the positive side to some of it the postive side to this outwayed the plessureable side to it....not really psychosis, iv still been there in the head.... i have had dilusions at one stsge after truma.

enternal auditorys went away pretty sure somthing was in my system, i suspect was in a correctional facility when i first started. 

consistly reinforcing its presance was at one stage
*auditory flooding...
with music and so on... 

*pretty sure my condition is no one conidtion but multiple conditions. 

* had hemriods, basically a rape simulation..
was getting sexually assulted by my own head
rape talk so on forth lasting till last year 

hearing shit say there outside life latley...


various forms of reinforcement....
minamizing stuff i do
in general it feels like a attack at times, opressive headspace.

hate fucking psych meds there fucking torture"
286,Realization,"So I realized something today.
In the past the way I soothed myself when I felt angry, sad, or overwhelmed, or just needed some help getting to sleep, was to imagine my death, many times at my own hand. I recently (a few months ago) realized this was unhealthy after doing it for years, and actively avoid doing (shut down those thoughts when they pop up) it because it's an automatic thing my brain does now. 
So the thought I had just now as I shut down those thoughts since I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping is ""if I knew anyone I even remotely care about did this, it would break my fucki g heart"". I realized how hurtful, unhealthy, and just wrong it is to do that, and am glad I have steered away from it. Still suffer from suicidal ideation, but am getting a lot better as time goes on, and the fact I had this rational thought on the situation makes me feel like there's light at the end of this very dark tunnel."
287,My parents wont take me seriously about my mental health problems,"(15M) I have had frequent panic attacks and depressive episodes since 2015 when my grandfather was admitted to a hospital for a heart condition, and panic have been happening nonstop daily for the past 12 weeks. I can barely get any sleep no matter what I try (From moving beds to melatonin) and I have become extremely reclusive around others over the past 18 months. I brought up these problems with my parents (which my mother is going through chemo and my dad works 12 hours a day at a hospital) and they told me to “get it together or were admitting you to a psych ward”. I don’t want to go, and I am running out of other options for what I can do. I have called the National Suicide Hotline 4 times and I haven’t been helped for longer than a few days. Is there anything I can do? I just want to be happy again."
288,Uhh Seizures are... fun?,"Just want to get my feelings out in the open. I had my first ever seizure at 28 years old. And after A LOT OF TESTING (mris, eegs, sleep deprived studies etc) only thing doctors can tell me is tests look ""suspicious"" or ""concerning"" and then prescribed me a general seizure medicine and hope for the best?

I know seizures can be triggered by so many things but its... terrifying experiencing this for the first time as an adult. 

I know so many families have to deal with this seeing their kids go through it and I feel guilty for complaining but, shit seizures suck."
289,"nothing is working, i dont know what to do, its just getting worse","i dont know what to do, everything is getting worse and worse and nothing is helping, i've tried therapy, medicine, 3 mental hospitals, none of those worked, i want to die every single day and i cant take it anymore, i dont know what else im supposed to do"
290,Is it possible to get PTSD from being around someone who was injured and went through a traumatic event?,"I almost lost my mom in a car accident that left her with minor TBI when I was 13. I grew up homeschooled by her before it happened and I was homeschooled in 8th grade after she came back from the hospital. I had a really tough time getting used to the changes, so it was obviously not a very happy time to say the least. I was homeschooled until I graduated when I was 18. 

Since that time, I realized that I have anxiety behind the wheel. I'm 22 and I still don't have my license. I'm scared of either getting into a car accident like my mom did, causing the same thing to someone else, or worse. 

On top of that, I started to realize that after seeing my mom in an ambulance being driven away to the hospital after her last seizure 6 years ago that I find myself being either startled by ambulance sirens or just find myself briefly in a daze. 

The reason why I ask is because I'm in the middle of counseling and I recently found a TBI support group for patients and family members on Facebook. I asked if anyone else had an experience similar to mine with driving and while I've had other commenters telling he similar experiences, I've already had two commenters tell me that that sounds like PTSD. One of them claims to be in the medical field. 

I've already emailed my counselor about the same question. (She's a counselor from the university I go to so she's currently on break until the semester starts.)

Does this sound like PTSD to you guys? (I don't know if this is the right subreddit so if there's a better place for me to ask, then please tell me.)

Thank you."
291,Feeling like someone who means so much to me is going to leave me,And my thoughts are: I might as well die before they do and the impulse is too much. I don’t know how to stop it. I have nothing to live for. I don’t know what to do. I try and talk to people about my feelings and when I tell them I don’t want to get too into detail they just say “okay” and stop responding like they’re offended.
292,At what point do affirmations become delusions.,"When I read about how others deal with some of the mental struggles I have, people often bring up using positive self-affirmations. I tried doing them myself but they just don't seem to have the same effect on me. Instead I just feel like I'm lying to myself. Surely if the things I try to tell myself were true, I'd hear them from others and not have to tell myself. If I just keep telling myself things that mightn't be true does that just border on delusion, and stop me from actually becoming a better person? Am I approaching this wrong, or is this practice just not for me?"
293,Missing the iron,"Idk if some can relate, I'm pretty sure some of you do. Working out and training was/is my passion and the biggest positive influence on my mental health. As you know gyms closed at the start of the pandemic and I kind of panicked so I desperately searched websites and Offerup for equipment and bought a decent amount of what I needed. Then when gyms re-opened I sold everything naively thinking gyms won't close again. Then it did in November. And now our governor extended the closures, and I get its to battle against the spread of covid. But why is Walmart open, supposedly at 25% capacity but it's sure as hell not below or at that capacity everytime I go there. 
SORRY IM RANTING but my point is not being able to train is affecting my mental health and I'm probably borderline getting depressed, having negative thoughts, irritability,  losing weight. Wanna hear y'alls thoughts especially y'all who love to workout and hows it affecting you not having to train."
294,Sexual guilt.,"I'm not sure how to word this so I'll just come out and say it.

Trigger warning: sexual assault or similar.



I've spied on a few of my friends. Sexually.
Trigger warning -

I know it stems from not feeling good enough.
I've had many women hurt me, but I know that doesn't make it okay.

I've seen my friends get dressed without them knowing. 📸🎥📸🎥

I've even gone through their phones without them knowing and taken personal photos from them.

The justification at the time was ""no one will ever see this but me. It's not actually hurting anyone.""

And I have been super suicidal for a long time. I always feel lonely and I frequently ejaculate.

The crazy thing is though, I always protect women. I've stood up to rapists. I've dropped drunk girls home. I've covered people up when they're clothes have been ripped. It's just this weird fettish.

But this pervertive side of me has been getting worse and worse.

In the past I've deleted everything of women I've had and then I later regretted not keeping it.
Most of which was just screen shots from their social media pages.

Lately I've been valuing my life a little bit more and one of my closest friends whom I keep getting closer to AS A FRIEND is someone who's trust I've broken... And even though I've done it before to others (who were kind of shitty to me) this time I feel guilty. I regret it all now. If I tell her she would probably feel uncomfortable with me and I would lose a real friend.

Like outside of that guilt that sometimes hits me, I'm not weird around her and I don't sexualise her when we hang out. I love her as a friend and I want the best for her and many other people I know.

Is just turning over a new leaf enough? Could I just smash the camera I've used and delete everything?

Or should I just accept that I'm a piece of shit, own up to it so people don't feel so bad when I kill myself? I don't want to live with this stigma. But I don't want to be a bad person.

I hate how this sense of never being good enough and these stupid sexual desires consume me.

Over a year ago also, someone close in my life started an only fans account. This was someone I was very sexually attracted to more than anyone. I found out that it was happening before it did and I made an Instagram and only fans. I pretended I was a total stranger and hit her up for some very explicit videos and I was wildly happy when I got them. It turns me on more knowing she would never send me anything that explicit as she was very premiscuous with many guys, but barely let me ever hug her. I never felt good enough around her and I had to see her almost every day which constantly reminded me how everyone else was good enough but me.

Outside of all of this stuff I think I'm a really good person. I help others, I work, I don't stare at people or make rude comments, I've forgiven a lot of people, I try to grow. I've been there for people time and time again. I gave a homeless person $50 recently when I don't have much money myself.

I think there is something wrong with my body as even though I'm an adult now, I get uncomfortable erections even when I'm not sexualising things. This has been happening for most of my life.

During intercourse when a woman has ever said no, I've always respected it. I've always checked in with them. I've stopped when they've wanted to.
And if a woman has rejected me I haven't pushed them.

I've had women touch me in sexual ways without my consent though. Even after I've said no.

Please I know I seem like a piece of shit. But I haven't been caught, that's not why I feel guilty. I just feel guilty because this isn't the person I want to be. Especially to those who are good to me. Surely telling her this is absolutely pointless.

I think I will feel too much shame telling her and maybe I have to find a way to end this cycle and go my seperate ways from her.

I wish I could start my life over with the awareness I have now 😢

I feel scared admitting this, but please know that I'm admitting this here and I want to be a good person.

I've tried to find similar discussions but I can't find anything."
295,I'm not sure if I should get myself checked,"There are days when my mood goes really low for no major reason, and I start feeling depressed. I lose the motivation to do things. Sometimes it comes with easily getting angry over the smallest things. Sometimes it comes with wanting to die as well as suicidal thoughts. But this is episodic, meaning it might happen every few days, weeks, or even months. On other days, I'm normal and don't have these mental issues. It might be related to my porn addiction, but I'm not sure. Should I get myself checked? I'm somewhat hesitant because I'm afraid I won't be able to explain myself well and because I'm afraid that there is actually nothing wrong with me and I'll just look like some overreacting idiot."
296,Guilt of Death,"This was 10 years ago during middle school. I made fun of a classmate and bullied him. He was murdered later that day by his father. I regularly struggle with the fact I never got to apologize or say that I didn’t mean it and that he died with my words on his mind. 
I only post this to remind people to be kind and never say anything you don’t mean and to not judge people, because you don’t know what they’re truly going through🙏🏼💕"
297,Just a vent..,"I immediately left and didn’t think at all.. nothing processed and did with the motion around me. Everything was happening before me like a movie and I was just watching. I felt detached, almost like 2 feet a part from my own body. I followed a script of how I usually went about a day like at work and school. Said hello, goodbye, and disappeared. It was not until I got home that I felt inside my body and realized what was going on, to a degree. I immediately wept and thought how my worst fear could ever come true. I sat in my dorm closet, crying for hours. I would lay in the center and cover my eyes until they were numb. Several hours pass and my roommate never shows. She preferred living at home anyways. The other roommates turned off the lights, and I went to my kitchen where only moonlight brights the room. I went into the fridge and my stomach was empty, but not hungry. I forced a spoonful of lemon sorbet and called it a meal for the day. This was my only meal each day for a week. I go to sleep and watch the door for hours to make sure you don’t come in. I look at my empty roommates’ bed and wish she was there to remind me I’m not alone. I fell asleep and escaped the worst day of my life. The next couple weeks were nonexistent. I followed a script, and made sure to play my part correctly in my school routine. I quit my job, and cried every night in my closet before bed. I would walk from my closet to my bed with numb eyes, and watched the door every night for hours making sure you never walked in. Nothing ever made sense to me, I just watched life without question. I visited a therapist, and told her everything that happened like it was a screenplay. This numbed me and I accepted it as my only source of help. I kept going, and rarely had a thought. I would go to my religious class and saw the poster. It was the same poster I looked at out of boredom before the worst day of my life. It had helplines and advice for survivors of rape. I read it all the time and thought “God I hope that never happens to me” and now I read it and actually write down the phone numbers and follow the advice. My computer science final comes around and I teleport back to the memory. Everything freezes, tears are on my test, and next thing I know I’m sobbing in the parking lot behind the building. My next final, in my class where we had to present a final PowerPoint. I sat in my seat and the professor tells everyone to get their presentations ready. I never knew we had a final. I ran to the bathroom and started at the wall wondering when the professor mentioned a final. But the only memory I have is from the worst day of my life. I go back to the classroom and run out of the room with my backpack just as the professor turns off the lights for final presentations. I run back to my dorm and start sobbing. This has been my life everyday since November 3rd, 2019. I struggle to think of other things. The only thing I can remember is the day you raped me."
298,Vengeful thoughts,"I suffer from intrusive, vengeful thoughts and have been for a year and a half now, ever since someone I thought was my best friend heavily disrespected and belittled me because I was stressed out of my mind at the time and it must have been a convenient ego boost for him to mog someone he knew was too worn out to stand up for himself.

Ever since I left that city I would have random anger attacks throughout each day where I would fantasize about beating or stabbing him in retaliation. But every time, the logical part of my brain tells me he wouldn't deserve that and then I calm down and some time passes before the next anger attack. This is hell and I don't ever want to trust or get close to another person ever again."
299,A short story I made about dysmorphia,"This is my first time ever writing, and I really don't know if it's good or what i need to change but I got the idea at around 3 in the morning. I hope it affects someone and is memorable enough. 

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgtkVZPhhNXYdiZnqPSQF0cDX88-pBnTXgcbkxMWOLM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FgtkVZPhhNXYdiZnqPSQF0cDX88-pBnTXgcbkxMWOLM/edit?usp=sharing)"
300,I just typed out a huge post about how I don't know myself then accidentally exited out. I hate myself.,I'm stupid
301,What is the best way to accomplish my goals?,"Goals for 2021

1. Shower every day. Especially on the hard days.

2. Stream for a total of 24 hours at least 3 days a week.

3. Spend an hour on building/painting miniatures at least 3 days a week.

4. Read all of the Gotrek &amp; Felix Omnibus books. One omnibus every two months.

5. Lose 100 pounds. Small incremental changes. Eat less and move more.

6. Conquer my mental health issues. Keep up therapy and seeing psychiatrist."
302,Everyone says get help but no one really knows how hard it is to get help,I’ve been scouring through so many websites for so many different hospitals and doctors but it’s so difficult to find an appointment. And the cost is insanely high and even then there’s a risk that the doctor might not provide a proper diagnosis and chalk it off to lack of sleep /not enough rest etc. Its so frustrating.
303,Is my depression valid?,"I ask myself all the time, i have thought of suicide and even planned it out  but never had an attempt. I know thinking about something is different from doing it.  I just feel like its not."
304,I'm almost 40 and at rock bottom. Is there any waybi can significantly improve my quality of life?,"I am almost 40 and I have wasted my life and my health. I have no friends and I have never had a significant other. I hate anything, everything, and everyone. I wanted to do so much in my life, but I know that if I tried to do it now that I will not get what I want out of it because I've ruined my life. I didn't take care of myself, soni am wrinkled all over and my teeth are almost gone. No one wants to be around someone like me and I understand that. I understand that I did this to myself.

I understand that I ruined my life but I dont know how to go on or even try to improve my.life because I know that nothing will.come.of it.

I know I will never get the career I want because strangers tell me I look rough all the time. I know I will never find meaningful relationships because of my decades of poor hygiene and because at this point in life, most people are not looking for new friends.

I have ruined every aspect of.my life and I know I can't vlame.anyone but myself. I am not suicidal, but i need to know is there any way to significantly improve my quality of life? I am poor. I am ugly. I have deep wrinkles all over my body. My teeth are almost gone. 

I know and realize that a big part of me is seeking attention by putting this here, but I'm at rock.bottom and I know there is no light at the end of this tunnel I've dug myself in, so is this it for me?

The usual response i get it is that 'well you should have taken care of yourself which is true, but is this it for me?

This feels.like a life sentence for a crime that doesn't fit. I dont know what to do because I will never be able.to.leave this rock.vottom I've dug for myself. 

No one respects me and no one wants to know me and I dont blame them. But I dont know what to do because this is it for me. Thr only joy I have in life is losing myself in my imagination.  I need something.  I know the sum of my life is too little, too late but it is hard to accept that this is it for me. I just need something to help me. Something.

305,Mental health and self care,"🏋 🧘‍♀️➕ 😊
I've finally learnt take some time off and allow myself to breathe. I used to get a lot of negative thoughts and used to be too critical of myself. I still get anxiety but I've been lifting heavy and meditate every now and then. I've been learning more and more about mental health. 
Today is the day of started my YouTube channel. 
It includes mental health and self care content. 
Do give me some constructive criticism. Thank you 😊

306,Do you guys also overreact to small shit?,"Around like 7 or so I went to the store and came back and I put sanitizer on, rubbed out and it dried,  10 minutes later I’m just watching YouTube and I do weird shit when I’m not paying attention and somehow I got the the taste of the sanitizer on my tongue, again it had dried out and it just still smelled like it and I didn’t even put that much right? And I start freaking out that I taste the sanitizer even though it was just the residue that just lingered. And it’s not even enough to make someone remotely sick if at all because it wasn’t even a full pump of sanitizer and it was mixed on both hands. But because I had the taste I was thinking I poisoned myself and washed my mouth like 10 times, and then scrubbed my tongue and I don’t even taste it anymore. If I’m tasting anything it’s probably my anxiety faking it or my toothpaste yet my anxiety is telling me I’ve been poisoned. And I google it and a baby, not even a grown person needs like 5 full pumps of sanitizer to show signs of it being poison. I had a taste of it that was already dried. 

Anyone else have this problem?"

309,Mentally Ill Brother Thinks me and family r gaslighting,"I’m 17, My brother is 23 and mentally not stable. He has never worked a job up until a month ago, which my dad got for him. He was previously medicated but is now not. He has diagnosed add and adhd so far that I know of. My father, as well as myself believe he has something more serious. Not sure yet. He refused to accept the fact that he has a problem and says that we are gaslighting him and trying to manifest and create the problems in which he already has. I tried to talk to him and appeal to him by suggesting he put himself in my fathers shoes. A father of a son who has had mental health issues and my brothers always hated, regardless my father has always kept trying to help. He refused to even listen and went bananas on me and made me leave his room.

311,Reporting an old sexual assault,"Recently I have been thinking about a sexual assault i experienced in my 20’s. My husband (who was my boyfriend at the time friend sexual assaulted me in my sleep. Me, my boyfriend and the rapist were all heavily drinking at my house one night and I woke up to this man sexual assaulting me at the time.

I told my boyfriend and a friend of mine when the rapist left my house. I never reported it because my boyfriend was pretty dismissive of the whole think and carried on being the rapist friend. I was forced to see the rapist socially for years and due to a low self esteem never really did anything about it.

Recently my husband has had a falling out with the rapist and for the first time I have been saying negative comments about him to other people (nothing about the rape, just being vocal about not likely him as a person). A lot people also don’t like him due to his behaviour regarding treating women badly and being a horrible person in general.

One woman he needs from school called him creepy and said she wouldn’t be alone with him.

Now I’m feeling bad about not reporting the assault because he may of done it to lots of people since then.

I’m wondering how long you have to report a crime like this? I know I won’t get anywhere for myself, however I was wondering if I could write a report that if he rapes someone else again I can testify what happened to me for their case."
312,help please,"I dont know what subreddit to post this to but I figure this works- 
Ive never wanted to make a post like this but im currently in a lot of psychological pain. I've never been to a doctor about it but I think its safe to say I have depression. These past few years have been terrible for me mentally, and its only been getting worse (2020 has been my worst year). Getting rejected from almost every college I wanted to go to didnt help my case either, while seeing that my ""friends"" (who have been consistently treating me like garbage for years) have all gotten into their dream schools. (Note that this last sentence isn't nearly the cause of my depression and was just a cherry on top of a much broader problem).

I am grateful that I did end up getting into a very good school but it has a highly stressful, competitive environment and doesn't exactly improve my mental health. I spent my first semester on campus but my classes were fully online so I barely left my dorm unless it was to get a meal. Unfortunately, it will be the same exact scenario next semester (thanks covid). Additionally, covid restrictions make voluntary social interactions much harder on campus, so there are rarely any opportunities to meet new people. (Though things probably wouldn't even be different even if covid wasn't a thing since I am also severely socially awkward/anxious).

So yeah - I currently have no close human connections. I dont know a single person who cares about me beyond a surface level (like I said, I have high school ""friends"" but I'm just the butt of the joke most of the time).

On top of my loneliness, I believe I also have some sort of biological depression - I simply don't experience joy that much anymore. I have lost interest in most of my hobbies (namely, videogames) and everything in life just seems boring now. I'm currently on winter break and I never have a reason to leave my house. Some days, I spend hours sitting in bed just doing nothing. I am constantly miserable.

I've already done my own research into some non-medical ways of fixing myself. I've been on exercise routines (on and off). They help a little bit but 1) its hard to maintain a consistent workout schedule and 2) they dont make a fundamental difference in my outlook on life itself. I do enjoy exercising but its not a solution to my problems.

Anyway, the impetus that made me post this is that I managed to get a Google interview for an internship position this coming summer. Its a technical interview over the phone and I've been practicing programming problems for weeks. Working at Google is my absolute dream job and obviously, getting an internship is a good way to get my foot in the door at the company. I'm making this post because I would like some guidance as to how to proceed with my life from here.

1. How do i cope with my (probable) failure to get the internship? I'm not even putting myself down here, since its statistically very unlikely ill get an offer especially since the hiring process often contains an element of luck and there are thousands of applicants for only a few hundred slots.
I already understand that not getting the internship does not mean the end of the world, and I know that I'll (probably) have future opportunities. The problem is that I don't know if I can deal with my current self until that uncertain day arrives. I know this is cheesy, but i view this potential internship as my chance to prove myself to the world in some way - to show people that I am capable of things.
2. What do I do about my lack of happiness in general? My ""college experience"" is nonexistent (both due to Covid and due to my own crappy personality) and the idea of taking online classes and doing homework in my dorm room ALONE for the next 4 months terrifies me and I dont know what to do.

This post is also the first time I've ever put these thoughts into writing, so I'm nervous even posting this. Thanks in advance to whoever responds."
313,I’ve been struggling lately,"Lately I’ve been struggling with everything . From eating, washing, getting up out of bed, holding a conversation, over thinking and leaving the house. I keep gettin intrusive thoughts about wanting to harm but I don’t actually want that! I feel like I’m loosing my mind ! 
I’m really not doing good at all, my parents are even noticing more now where I used to be able to hide it well. I guess there is no hiding things anymore because my sister out-ed me to them in a very public and dramatic way. I had a episodic breakdown in front of my parents a couple of weeks back and since then I’ve been feeling like a fool/ashamed. 

These used to never be big issues of mine and my hygiene was always on point, and now I feel like it’s such an effort to get up and get in. I feel like things are all starting to fall apart and I’m not strong enough to get a grip. My mother is always trying to get me out for walks and come in to chat but I can’t bring myself to do it. She’s been giving out to me telling me I can’t be doing this,  it’s unhealthy but I really cannot bring myself to engage with anyone.

I am working from home and living in a small apartment alone, next to my parents home and I think that being in the one room is toying with my mind. In the last couple weeks I’ve tried moving back into my home at night and spending more time inside with my parents but I still keep going to the apartment to just be alone. I’ve been spending so many days in tears out there thinking about everything, always with a negative outlook. I just wish I had friends that I could actually talk to, I’m so sick of being here !"

322,7 self-care tips to remain balanced,"Mental health is important. Those moments when we feel like we want to be secluded from the world may be our inner self reminding us to be STILL, get some rest, and recharge.

Many of us are constantly on GO mode and don’t know when to stop. It’s okay to yield to your spirit and listen to the messages it may have for you. So when you are not feeling up to being around noise or chatter, do not allow others to bully you into their space. Take that time of seclusion for some self-love therapy.

324,What does it mean if I didn't feel anything when either of my Grandparents died?,"This is a morose way to bring in the new year, but I (34 M) feel like it's very odd that I didn't feel much of anything when either of my Grandparents died. I knew them both my whole life. They were nice people, but I never felt any sort of connection to them. In fact I've always found it to be very difficult to connect with others. If someone in my immediate family died, I think I would take it pretty hard, but even then I'm not super sure.


Is there something ""wrong"" with me, and if so, what could it be? Or is this pretty common? I always hear about people being very sad when their Grandparents die, watching other people grieve in the moment when I don't feel anything. When people hear my Grandma died, they sent me messages like ""I'm so so sorry for your loss"", as if I was completely heartbroken which makes me think I should be caring much more than I do.

Again it's not like my Grandparents were people I disliked in the slightest, never had any arguments or anything, I just felt no connection to them, despite knowing them my whole life. I would see them often at get-togethers throughout the year, and they were always very nice to me and likeable people, but we never talked much at all or anything.

I thought for a while I might have Schizoid Personality Disorder, but I don't know if that fully checks out."
325,Was i wrong to end a friendship because her mental health issues affected my mental health?,"
Long one. TW: suicide, mental health

In 2017-18 I was 15 and became close with someone in my class let’s call her K. She had a lot of problems, mainly stemming from the fact that her coming out as gay meant she was outcast in school and she was in foster care because her parents were homophobic. The LGBT students and allies tended to stick together as majority of the school were homophobic idiots. K also had a gf in school who was two years older than us. 

While I was getting closer to K, I noticed that a lot of my other friends used to speak to her but had stopped being friends with her. I didn’t take much notice of this and they mentioned that Ks gf was incredibly manipulative and caused them to have fights and stop speaking to them. I decided to make my own judgements though and I began talking and texting her a lot. 

Due to all of the crap in her life, K was becoming increasingly mentally unwell. She was very erratic and would scream at people randomly, laugh endlessly, create crazy stories such as her brother being killed and her other one being terminally ill, would tell me she wanted to kill her self and overdose and disappear and then come back as if everything was normal. She would blurt out very inappropriate things to teachers, accuse people of wanting to hurt her, run to the toilets and lock the door saying she wanted to kill herself and would be very insistent that if I told any members of staff about the things she was doing she would definitely hurt herself. While all this was going on, her gf was not helpful and made things worse by putting ideas in her head and regularly breaking up with her and getting back together making K feel like she needed her. It felt like a game where she would tell me what she wanted to do to herself so I was constantly trying to save her only for her to turn around and gaslight me saying that she’s fine and she doesn’t need help. 

I was the only one dealing with her and I felt like I was going crazy. I have anxiety, and I didn’t realise the toll it was taking on me to constantly be chasing her and trying to help her when she would jsut laugh in my face or act like she never said such terrifying things then repeat the cycle again. My cousin died suddenly during this time and I took time off. During this time i realised how much I was being impacted by her. I was exhausted. I spoke to the old friends and they told me they stopped speaking to her for similar reasons. I couldn’t distinguish between her mental illness and her deliberately hurting me anymore and I was stressing myself out because she made me feel like I was responsible for her life. Eventually when I got back to school I started slowly detaching myself from her. She definitely detected the change in my willingness to sit with her and listen to her so she ramped it up. She screamed at me that she was taking all her painkillers again and then ran away. 

I gradually cut off speaking to her and did explain why to her so it’s not like I didn’t give her reason. She stopped coming to the class we had together. we never spoke again but she seemed quieter and it took me a lot of time and with my therapist to learn that I am not responsible for her and heal from that relationship. 

A year ago, a mutual friend died and everyone in our circles began reconciling with people they fought with as life is too short. I briefly met her at the funeral but didn’t say anything as my anxiety skyrocketed when I saw her. She seemed a lot healthier, calmer and happier and she was back with her mother and left her gf. People are telling me I should reach out and reconcile since everyone else is but Thst ‘friendship’ affected me badly, even if it was because her mental health was declining. 

Was i being mean by stopping our relationship? Should I reconcile with her?
Thank you for taking the time."
326,I feel very dependent on my boyfriend,"I had a dispute with my dad regarding something so insignificant to the point where we are not talking to each other. Lately I've been doing okay without talking to my boyfriend for longer periods of time since hes been so busy working. Today, he responded to my text late and we talked for a good hour, and when he had to say gn cause he had work in the morning. I felt like, sad. I feel like I am feeling this way because he distracts me from my annoying argument with my dad, and when hes gone I miss him, and I snap back to reality where my dad is in the picture. I just feel like crying because idk I feel so stuck? Like I don't wanna see nor speak to my dad because I was 110% right in our dispute, its just him being petty and I hate it when hes like that. And its like when im talking to my boyfriend I feel like I have no issues in the world. I just want to stop feeling so dependent, I used to be so toxic wen it came to dependency in the past, but I am getting better but struggling along the way. How do I get better at this? I just feel hurt.   


(btw me and my boyfriend had already discussed his absence and me feeling really lonely and neglected, but we're gonna secretly hangout soon, but this fight is draining me and I feel so dead and everything feels like slow motion when not talking to my bf) 

I hope i make sense, I'm just like, I can't really focus rn and I just want to talk to him more. I can't help but want and feel more dependent on him to make me happy"
327,Losing my personality after death of my father,"It's been 2.5 years since I lost my father. I can truly say he was the love of my life. Everything I did was in the hopes of making him proud. We could go on vacation together alone and never run out of things to talk about. He made me feel safe and secure in the world.

Since his death I feel that I have just shriveled away. Everything I used to be interested in or want to achieve has no meaning to me anymore. I am barely hanging onto my career in politics, I stopped caring about art or music, I don't have any interest in the news or exploration. I have worked hard in therapy to finally be able to function and feel I've truly come out the other side of depression, but I'm left feeling my reason to be has been robbed.

Has anyone gone through the same thing? I am tired of how dull I've become."
328,How should people with mental illness respond to “Think about those starving children in Africa”?,"“Think about those starving children in Africa”
 
“Think about people who have lost their families in the pandemic”

“Think about patients with actual problems like cancer”

“You are very privileged compared to the rest of the world. It is selfish to claim that you have mental illness when people are dying out there”

People often try to invalidate mental illness by pointing their fingers to the less fortunate. These statements insinuate that a person should not suffer from depression unless they have experienced extremely traumatic events. 

Apart from invalidating the feelings of the mentally ill, these statements vilifies mentally ill people by suggesting that they are selfish and out of touch. This could lead to further self-stigmatisation, causing mentally ill patients to blame themselves or hide their problems, thereby exacerbating their symptoms.

The truth is that patients with mental illness very often cannot control their own feelings. There are many privileged people, who lead seemingly perfect lives, fall prey to mental illness and commit suicide. The truth is that mental illness does not discriminate. All people, regardless of race, gender, or background, can suffer from mental illness.

How should people with mental illness respond to these statements?"
329,Frigging Medications (and doctors)!,"Well, I was not happy with my medication. I have been on Lithium for at least 5-years and still struggling with insomnia. An indication that maybe, just maybe I should not be killing my kidneys slowly and try something different. I was given Thorazine which gave me severe constipation especially because Lithium tends to do that alone. So being the end of the sucky 2020 I suggested changing meds for 2021. Should not the pdoc have suggested it? Anyway, after my suggestion the new pdoc I am with for almost a year now, says; **""great plan, in 10-20 years (I am 64) you'd be thanking me for saving you from dialysis!""** then he proceeds to tell me how dangerous Lithium is for the elderly kidneys. Indeed I heard a 37-year-old woman having a 60-year old's kidney because of Lithium.  
My pdoc said it like it was his idea! It should have been! But I am most angry at my Chiese ex-pdoc for 4+ years who also KNEW that I cannot sleep and let me take lithium! Then my pdoc says ""well, for Depakote we have to monitor your liver but this is not nearly as bad as Lithium for the kidneys.""  
I am on Depakote (while tapering off Lithium) for a short time and it is sedative but when hypomanic that is what I need. I also feel nice and mellow."

331,I’m a first generation Asian American and I want to seek therapy for my parents.,"It has always been a challenge to communicate with my parents, part of it is because I am no longer fluent in my Vietnamese. The other reason is because growing up we never talked about our feelings and emotions. I grew up in a unstable household, my parents were always arguing and eventually got a divorce 10 years ago. Sill not mutual, they can’t even be in the same room together. Ever since then, my dad has just gone downhill. His debt is out of control and mental health is deteriorating. There aren’t many Vietnamese therapists in my area, a lot of the Asian community don’t believe in therapy and mental health.  We also don’t have the money to pay hundreds of dollars per session, I believe some therapists take insurance. But I’m lost with how to approach this."
332,Being addicted to daydreaming (Maladaptive daydreaming),"hey um.. I recently found out about this ""disorder"" (i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the DSM)

It is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day. They create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc.

They often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up. Also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement (like pacing around). I have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way (((excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol)))

Those people do NOT gaslight themself. In fact most of MDers are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm/imagination and which are not.

Effects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that ""disorder"" sometimes find it very hard to focus on ANYTHING.

Some people argue that daydreaming is natural and MD should not be regarded as a mental illness. I think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness. It is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point MDers find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don´t enjoy reality as much anymore. And this is an endless circle. Because if you don´t do stuff with other people or your friends, and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends, scenarios and word will look more and more appealing.

I recently found out that i might have this ""disorder"". I have stumbled across this because I had problems with not being able to live in the present. A lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical. So instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there.

Since then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is Eli Somer. He was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about MD on youtube.

Here is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic)

If you have any thoughts, or further research sources please drop them here. And especially if you have experience with this subject first hand.

I just want people to know that this is real and effects people.

334,"Smartphones, and my mental world.","
Ever since i got my smartphone (12) I feel like i began a slow decay process of mental health (im 20 now). It could be many other things like being a teenager, more responsibilities and whatever life throws at you. But I genuinely think my relationship with my phone is very dangerous.

after an experiment i did yesterday, where i only picked up my phone to answer calls,texts, check reminders (20min total btw), i felt much more healthy mentally. I didn’t listen to songs that day too. Didn’t check social media. Just me and my life but no distractions. Just my thoughts. I felt like i used too before the age of 12. More myself, didn’t care about others or what they were doing (i mean didn’t compare myself to others the bad way). I knew what i wanted back then, what i stand for. There was no mental noise or stress like the day before it.

Today i picked up my phone for hours, and the difference is apparent.

I planned out a detox plan from my phone for the next month. A maximum of 1hr 1st week. Hopefully I’ll get to 20 mins by the end of the month

Wanted to see people’s opinions (Not just on what i did, but the topic, and if anyone did anything similar)"

337,How do I stop dreaming about my ex,"Okay so not trying to sound like a total weirdo or psychopath but I can’t stop dreaming about my ex.
Me and my ex met in October of this 2020 and it was the greatest thing ever, she was the girl version of me and the sweetest thing ever. The only problem was she was 2 years younger then me but at the same time everything about the relationship was legal. I don’t usually well I don’t ever date a younger girl but she was actually quite mature for her age and everything just seemed too good to be true. Well we dated for a month everything was great, it was my greatest experience and relationship that I’ve ever had with a girl. Well we broke up suddenly for no reason at all, then the night we broke up she texted me and said that she was so sorry and mentally she was having problems and that she wanted me back, so ofcourse I took her back. After that breakup though we never were the same, we would hangout everyday but after the breakup we hung out 2 times until I finally confronted her on how she was acting very different and it just wasn’t the same girl that I thought I was falling in love with, and this is where things start getting out of hand. She just simply acts like she doesn’t care she says things like “oh you’re not my type, but you’re my pretty boy” (she called me pretty boy) or she would say just mean things almost like she wanted to breakup, well we ended up breaking up over text, and once we did I immediately blocked her on everything and deleted all of our photos. One day later I unblocked her and told her to thank her mom and I thanked her and I said “thank you for being the greatest girlfriend that I’ve ever had” and then I blocked her again because I didn’t really want to get hurt even more. After we broke up I couldn’t eat for days and I unblocked her and checked her social media and she was just posting childish indirects about me, and just really really hurtful things. So I confronted her about it and she read the message but then again she went on social media and said “I’m sorry for expressing myself on MY platform fool lmao” and idk it just really fucked with me because I really like this girl and she told me while we were dating that “I don’t know if I’m falling in love with you or thankful that you pulled me out of a dark place” and everything just felt a lie. Well fast forward a week and every single night she has been in my dreams and I just want it to stop. I just want to forget about her but my mind won’t let me and it’s so depressing, I’m losing motivation, I shower once every other day and she’s just messing with my mental health so much and I don’t know how to make it stop"
338,I feel empty,"I don't feel anything, I'm regretting a decision I took last year about one of my friend that I can't change anymore or someone else will get hurt. 

I only feel like I exist only to see time pass

Worst thing is that sometimes I feel like I'm faking all of this, and is terrible 

I can't do it like this"

340,"Where do I start? (Depression, anxiety)","For those who have begun addressing their depression: where did you start?

At 34 I have been dealing with my depression for almost 20 years, and anxiety for maybe 8 years. There have been very few periods of time where I was not on medication and/or in therapy. I'm not sure how to describe the difference I feel now, compared to then. Before, its almost like I was standing within a ring, and inside the ring were familiar problems and familiar avenues to deal with them. I was a college student, then a grad student, there were always resources available, student health clinics, etc. 

But now I find myself outside that ring, where the problems are bigger and heavier and there are way more of them. I don't know how to get good help or how to afford it. I don't know what ""better"" looks like. Everywhere I look (literally and figuratively) I see problems and stress and sources of shame. Do I start working on the anxiety regarding my health? Maybe the sense of imposter syndrome I feel regarding my depression and anxiety? Or the severe aversion I have to using the telephone? Or the fact that I haven't cleaned the cats litter boxes in a week and they're pooping on the floor? How about the horrific grief I still feel from losing my parents? How about the existential melancholy that sort of casts everything in fog? Do I quit my job? Can I qualify for disability? How to I inquire about this when I can't pick up the fkn phone? 

Maybe this doesn't make sense to most of you, but if it resonates for anyone, how did you get started? What made you choose that one problem or place or thing and start on it? 

I only ask that no one reply ""Just Do It."" That's not advice, that's a marketing slogan."
341,Why do I even bother?,"I'm scarred for life by my mental illnesses and with my mental illnesses. I just don't get the point of trying over and over just to get back to the staring line, if not backwards. 
I'm exhausted."
342,I have to get this out fast.,"I don't know what's happening. Ok no, maybe i do. But tonight is the second consecutive night this is happening.

How it happens:
my heart starts to beat real fast
my ears get hot and airy? as if someone is screaming from inside
my throat gets dry
my head suddenly dizzy
my eyes want to cry tears endlessly
my stomach hurts so bad it's like it's twisted in knots

Is this a panic attack? What is this? I know this is not the first time it happened to me but I have this behavior that despite being diagnosed, I still deny myself the reality of this all.

My brain is screaming at me rn. I'm sorry. I have to get this out fast."
343,In a bad place,I just broke up with my girlfriend. Before with her I was in a very bad place. I was always thinking of killing my self all the time. Today I got a message that told me she was gay. I have no clue what to think and none of my close friends/friend will respond.
344,Can an EEG detect an eating disorder?,My moms going to make me do one soon and im scared she’ll find out.
345,Don't crack under pressure?,"Do you guys fold under pressure? Have you ever felt felt anxiety when there are eyes on you even though you did this task flawlessly when no ones watching. 
A lot of of great athletes fold under pressure and can't give thier 100%.Has it ever happened to anyone? 

I make videos about mental health and self care
https://youtu.be/_N3YVLRXMCc"
346,One of my closest friends just waited in emergency for over 10 hours just to be sent home,"This is the second time this has happened, I just can’t understand that when someone is at that point where they feel they need to go to emergency because of how they feel in their head that doctors just make them wait for hours on end (in this case into the next morning) and then conclude that there’s “nothing wrong”. My friend has a history of pretty severe ADHD/depression and even still they sent her home. I know doctors are obviously busy but it just really sucks because people are there because they feel like they are at the end of their rope, yet it’s almost like they just don’t care"
347,I put away the suitcase that's lived in the middle of my room since August today,"It may not seem like a big thing to anyone else, but I went to see my boyfriend for a month from July to August in another country (he had to move back in with his parents at the start of the pandemic because of money issues caused by the pandemic) and I haven't moved or touched the suitcase i took with me, or anything inside it since I got back. Today I organised some of my room and moved everything from the suitcase into its own box under my bed, with some other things that remind me of happier times and my boyfriend (and I've put away the suitcase). It's a massive thing for me and my mind feels a little clearer for it. I cannot wait to get out of this place (my parents house) and also to see my boyfriend again but I think having a huge constant reminder in the middle of the room i spend 95% of my time in wasn't helping me"
348,anyone else have a weird obsession with how they used to look/ tiny details of their appearance???,"like for example if i hadn’t shaved my hands that day and they were stubbly it wouldn’t bother me so much in the moment but next day or few days i’ll be in a panic and become really depressed over it. this keeps happening and has been happening for over a year now. and with outfits too and it’s pure hell.

was just wondering if anybody else here has experienced this too? or what it could be? it’s honestly ruining my life and making me extremely suicidal too :( it’s like everything about em just HAS to be perfect, everything, even the tiniest of details. especially “past me” i feel like i’m gong crazy over i just wanna know i’m not alone"
349,I feel extremely stuck,"I’m currently stuck in this nonsense conscript army that my country requires. that’s taking up 2 years of my life.

All things generally went well for quite some time but I’ve seem to have developed adjustment disorder before developing generalised anxiety (actual diagnosis). A previous psychologist has also mentioned I have mild depression but insisted it was nothing to worry about. 

I get very frequent panic attacks that seem to be linked to my thinking about even going back to do army work (currently on a break til monday), that has been going on and off for the past 3 months now. This isn’t the first time during my service either. 

My issue here is, panic attacks I can kinda deal with. I used to deal with them by just exercising and productive work and studying unrelated to army stuff but due to a change of circumstances about 3 months ago, I had to stop for that entire duration. This led to my old binge eating tendency coming back and hitting really hard. I was in a pretty good place and I’m trying to get there again but I’m just so stuck right now. 

I started working out again like 2 weeks ago but I can’t stop the binge eating. Typically I can fight the urges for about a day or two before it comes back even harder. The fact that my odd addiction or whatever is hindering one of my major goals in life, coupled with my existing conditions are just making me feel very lifeless. 

I have a psychotherapy call in a few days to schedule me a slot but they previously informed me that it will definitely take a while so yea. Just feeling stuck, not sure if my odd rant makes any sense or if anyone here can relate."
350,Is it okay to make someone go to therapy?,"Ill explain. I have three brothers, one of them (lets call him G) is really depressed, he recently went through some bad stuff and that caused him to get into a really dark place. G came to me to talk and basically let it all out; that day, i told him that he should go to the therapist, that feeling that way for years was not okay and he needed help, it took me some time but at the end i finally convinced him to go (but he asked me to make the appointment myself, idk why but im on it)
After this, i told my other brother (lets call him D) what happened (i did not mention what G said to me, only informed him that G was going to go to therapy) i told him because we both worry about him, but also because D wants to go too and i wanted to propose him to come with us. 

But he told me that i should not butt myself into that, that it was personal and that G had to make that decision and do all the procedure himself.

Was i wrong?"
351,"Every post i make on here gets ignored, because im not important, but I do have a question...","I really wonder if its ""normal"" to maybe, not mind if people died? 

do other people not mind it either? 

I just dont really, care about people anymore.... I think emotions are fake. 

Most humans are selfish by nature, shouting and spouting, ""nobody owes anyone anything"" while they pay taxes for children to go to public school... 

saying, ""sounds like a you problem!"" while they live their privileged lives, and than text their significant other some bitchy whiny shit that they dont even wanna hear... but its a ""you problem"" 

I just see all humans as the same entity, selfish, rude, sadistic, happy when bad happens to you... say its all your fault. 

whats the big deal about people dying? 

i get accussed of, ""not having this opinion"" by people, like im just pretending not to care lol 

but i truly do have resentment and anger against the human race itself, ive never met a good person in my life. 

Im not claiming im an edgy psychopath, which is what people say, ""your not really a sociopath or you wouldnt post this cause you wouldnt care caught you!"" like i never said i was a sociopath, im just wondering from other people, if this is normal train of thought."
352,I want to breakup with my depressive girlfriend,"Okay, this is my first time around here and I just wanted to vent a bit and get some suggestions. I read somewhere this was the right place and anonymity really helps, so here it goes.
I’m in a weird place in my life right now, I’m trying to build a production company, looking for a part time job to help with that and to get out of my mom’s house. I have a relationship, we’ve been together for 3 years, since high school. So far so good. 
But it feels like the relationship has been holding me down, it’s taking my time and energy and I’m not enjoying it as much as I used to. I love this girl and I made big promises that I was willing to keep until these past few weeks, because I feel like I want to breakup lately.
We have sex like once a month sometimes once every 2 months and it feels like a chore for her, she’s always picking fights, and I’m growing further away from her every day (doesn’t help as well).
When somebody asks about her, I can only remember the bad things that she does (the arguments, the attitude, and the negativity overall just to name a few) and if I really want to complement her personality, I can maybe think of 3 good things at the most.
I had great moments with her, and she’s fun when I do what she expects me to do. I learned to play her game and win, but without the reward I used to get what’s the purpose of putting up with that anymore?
“We’re close friends that kiss and sleep in the same bed sometimes” that’s how I would describe my relationship in the past year. In 2021 I want to take every opportunity I get to grow professionally but I feel so much guilt when I try braking up with her (I tried and she cried so much that I couldn’t do it, she also threatened to kill or hurt herself. It’s serious and that’s keeping me from getting what I want). If something happens I’ll blame myself for it and I fear she will actually do it. She won’t understand that I don’t feel the same and she might do something unexpected. She also will NOT accept help from me or anyone and refuses to acknowledge that she has some kind of problem at all.
I don’t know what to do, I feel stuck and that no one can help. Maybe you guys have some advice, thanks and talk soon.

353,Help me out,"Does anyone know how I can stop all my negative self talk? I constantly belittle myself with thoughts like, “I’ll never get better, this will be the end of me, I wish I could go back, I wish I was the same fun loving kid I used to be, I hate how I am now.” Like I know none of this is helpful or constructive. How do I stop?"
354,Thinking,"I need to vent a little bit because I’m gonna be honest I haven’t even told anyone about this yet. I’ve had suicidal thoughts before. There were only 2 things stopping me. It wasn’t that my parents or other family and friends would be sad. It was the fact that I knew someone out there was living a worse life than me and pushing through it. The other thing was that I grew up having the belief that children couldn’t have depression and anxiety. I’m very much I happy person on the outside so it’s not like anyone knew. At the time I didn’t reach out and get help and I slowly got better but that doesn’t work for everyone so please if your having thoughts like I was/am reach out and get help. The people in your life love you. I’m alive now and want you to know that I love you, even though I’m a stranger and we my never meet again. I hope you get better."
355,Any advice ?&lt;3,
356,It really sucks how everyone just leaves you or treat you like shit when you have a mental illness,"I used to have a number of friends, but i lost most of them cus of my depression and anxiety. Im just not too outgoing, and boring. Always bringing people's mood down as well 

I have been friends with this guy for nearly 6 years and one day he finally got fed up with me and got into argument with me. I told him i attempted suicide a few days ago but he just called me edgy and a sensitive bitch and then went on to say that this is the reason why no one wanna be friends with me. Just fuck him seriously, i have always trusted him for so long but i honestly never expected him to say that to me.

Im already dealing with many other issues like family problems, school and money and then this shit just happened.

Now im just left with 1 friend, and Im afraid he's gonna leave me as well

Life's a fuckin bitch and I hate it."
357,Hard to workout with a stressful job,"I work at an extremely stressful job. We’re constantly on deadlines and it takes a lot out of me physically and mentally. Very rarely are we sitting at a desk all day. We travel quite a bit and have to turn in something by the end of the day. We typically have no time to take a proper lunch break at all. So most of the time I’m starving until I get off from work and usually have my first meal around 6 o’clock. I might eat snacks to hold me up, but it’s not enough.
I’ve noticed how difficult it is for me to wake up early and workout on days I have to work. Something in my mind Tells me I need to save all my energy for work. I rather stay in bed sleeping or doing nothing until I have to work. It’s like the stress is preventing me from having a routine. I don’t know why I’m like this. I want to get out of it, but it’s extremely hard.  I struggle with depression and anxiety and this job hasn’t helped. I recently started taking medicine and it’s helped a bit. I told my therapist about it and he just made it seem like I’m not trying hard enough. I don’t feel like that’s the issue. I feel like my unhealthy job is preventing me from doing this. Going into work, knowing how I’ll be worked fo the bone makes me not want to use up my energy before going in. I try to workout afterwards but by the time I’m off from work I’m so fatigued and  exhausted. A few weeks ago I took some time off from work and it was amazing. I worked out everyday and didn’t feel exhausted. I know I have the ability to do it, it’s just hard when I have to work. Any tips or advice ?"

361,Bipolar Dating Issues,"I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 for a few years now, but I’m medicated and can function day to day. My mania doesn’t get awful, I haven’t been hospitalized in 2 years, but the worst part about it is that I can never ever tell that I’m making bad/impulsive decisions until after it passes. Which leads me to about 3 months ago. A close friend of mine had confessed that they liked romantically me and I impulsively said that I liked them too and agreed to be their boyfriend. I think I was so excited about someone seeing me as an attractive person I saw the shot and took it without thinking about the consequences (people viewing me in that light is very uncommon). Now things are getting more serious and they want to be more physical and I’m getting nervous about it because the realization is just settling in. That im in a relationship I don’t think im prepared for or genuinely want. I just miss them as a friend and don’t want to ruin anything but I know being honest will break them. I also have autism and it’s hard for me to talk about emotional things in general. I might just be in a depressive state and when I get better I might like them again, but I don’t know if I can take it for much longer. Has anyone else struggled like this? Where your feelings for a partner fluctuate because of Bipolar? How do/did you deal with it?"

I stopped taking them (at lowest dose) about 4 weeks ago but I’m still experiencing withdrawal side effects (tiredness, brain zaps, feeling foggy)

Any idea how long these effects are likely to last as honestly I thought they would have resolved by now

364,Depression sign,I have not been able to get a job for months I have not met anyone outside my family months since corona. Today my friend invite me to her house for house warming. Everyone just seem so worry about me. More than anyone else. Their reaction kinda make me cautious for my action there. Then my friend text me asking if I am fine and tell me if I need a friend to talk to just tell him. He share how depressing it is during this time but really asking me to not to worry and offering some help. I am never aware any of this. But is it that easy to tell if someone having depression?
365,Im afraid ill turn mentally ill.,"Im 13, and i’ve been spending the last 3 years on YouTube. Ive been a little scared to post because ive seen 13-14 year olds being criticized on most platforms. I dont post or make memes i just watch videos a lot and dont have many friends. Things started when 2020 started and both my friends left for other education, where we had to get into quarantine. At first it was fine, i was spending about 6-8 hours on my phone because online school was easy in my country. At summer when this had been going for 4 months, i started having really bad headaches at night, and cried most of the time. We went to check what it was but it turned out that it was nothing. Afterwards my neck hurt, my legs felt weak and i started feeling emotionless. All of these went away when i realized i had been depressed ( I don’t wanna say it like that because I’m not an expert) but I felt as I was going to go insane and I was panicking every night. I thought a lot about things like what if I am going to die, or if I will be addicted to something in the future. My parents told me this was because I was going through my teen years but I don’t think this is only because of that. I don’t know what to do, being on my phone is my only place for happiness as my parents work a lot. I feel like I’m bothering them by asking for help because they really do a lot for me. I’m gonna try and stay away from social media if that will help, I just want to get rid of feeing sad."
366,Deleted Facebook but feel extra lonely,"On the 31st I deleted Facebook and Messenger. It was a long time coming. (And a difficult year) I didn't have many friends on there, and the ones I had barely replied. And Zuckerberg...yeah. Even so, I feel like there's a hole in me because I had Facebook for so long. I have CPTSD and I woke up angry and sad so I exercised and am eating healthier than I did. It's odd. I feel like I have no community, but Facebook wasn't cutting it as a community. I guess I had just gotten used to it. Ultimately I'm going to need to do online face meetings with new people, but I'm trying to ease into it.

368,Burned out on life and loneliness,"After spending the past 2 years in a full-on existential crisis that led me back onto treatment for depression and anxieties, I’m exhausted with life and being alone. I thought 2019 was going to be the worst year of my life when I went through a severe quarter-life crisis and lost a close family member for the second time in 3 years, but I made plans to make a fresh start in a new city as I had no friends and ran out of career options in the old city I lived for 3 years.

Flash forward to 2020 where I planned to make the move and network for a new career path after accepting a position in the city I wanted to live, and then the pandemic squashed those plans. I got the job before shutdown, but started after it hit. Since then, networking and job opportunities have squandered due to severe layoffs and meeting restrictions. The 2 years of isolation (and preceding years of loneliness) has completely run me down, and led to my worst recurrence of depression and anxiety in my 29 years of life. 

I know there appears to be some relief soon as vaccines rollout, but I’m burned out and can’t handle another 6+ months of isolation. I feel guilty to want to leave my unit and somewhat selfish as I have job security during these tough times, but I seriously have no idea what my future holds and where to go after my plan and fresh start fell apart. I have no friends, no family that I’m close to, barely even know my coworkers, and really don’t know what I’m even still here for or what I’m doing. I’m just tired of this."

371,Plz Read,"Please help

Hey, So you can delete this if not allowed, i’ve never used reddit to ask anything or post but in all honesty i don’t know what else to do. 

I had a rough childhood, i won’t go into details, no one wants a sob story, but long to short, my biological father in in prison for r*pe, my sister is an actual psychopath, and my mum has just gone through so much trauma that she’s become incredibly mentally abusive herself, i have never had money growing up, and when i say this i had to move away from everything i knew because my mum couldn’t afford to live in the area, however when my father went to prison my mother and sister were allowed to press charges and both got a lot of money for this, because i was doing my GCSE’s my mother never let me press charges, and two years later after i got diagnosed with a chronic illness and lost literally all my friends due to my sister, she kicked me out. 

I don’t know what to do really, i had a job, with great pay working as much as i could to support myself, but now with my illness i cannot work to fund myself, i get just enough from UC to cover my bills with me having to still find money every month to live, I’ve tried to look at “at home” jobs but because of Covid-19 they are overwhelmed and there is no chance of me getting one, i have no support from my family and i’m really struggling to keep pushing, it is the new year and i’m trying as hard as ever to try find a way to make money and support myself. So if anyone has any ideas or could help i would appreciate it so much, i’m really struggling with my mental and physical health and i’m scared i’ll never find a way out so this is my way to ask for help. 

I love art, one day i dream of creating my own business where i sell my art and my prints and creations to people who love them, i intend to make people happy, that’s one of my biggest outlooks on life, life is crap, but if i can try make people happy for a period of it, it makes it so much better, i’m a good person, i struggle with it a lot, but i know i am, if i had money i would help so many people and do so much good, nothing in my brain would want anything different but to make peoples life happier and comfortable, i want to make people feel safe and welcome, through whatever way i can and i honestly just wish i had the money to do so, i’d fund my little house with my cat and my small business and do as much good as possible in this shitty world. 

So this is my cry for help, message me, comment, i’m not sure but please, any ideas or anything to get a little bit of money so i can eat or live without panicking everyday, even just £10, thankyou :)"
372,"Depression broke out in lockdown. I’ve been healing, but the holidays are giving me my worst relapse in the longest time.","
A quick look back on this year.

I’ve been battling a lot of demons for the longest time, but this quarantine &amp; pandemic pushed them to be much stronger than their usual. Halfway through 2020, I developed symptoms for depression.

It’s a tough pill to swallow. Literally. And it’s even hard to talk about now, but I’ve grown to be more comfortable in being vulnerable. There’s so much stigma &amp; misconception surrounding having a mental illness, and to be honest, I wouldn’t know myself if I weren’t in it. It’s as physical of an illness as any other.

Serotonin levels are imbalanced along with a lot of other hormones, and it gets really hard to think. You space out &amp; forget things - or it’s too noisy. Or both. And I was probably the last person I’d expect to get it, given my overflowing confidence &amp; self-esteem, but apparently it converts back &amp; forth to real self-loathing &amp; negative thoughts. The quick flip from loud neon parties to isolation was almost impossible to bear. Everyone else was struggling, and everything felt like it was my own burden to bear.

So, step 1, get help. Not like someone who feeds you toxic positivity, but real professional help. Sadly, it’s tough when you have no money. Getting appointments, therapy &amp; medication is not cheap. Great thing, though it took some time, family was supportive.

Therapy helps, but the anti-depressants were the bomb. It really is not an abstract thing. Real illness needs real treatment. I was quick to get back to work, and all the noises were silent. I felt my hormones stabilize. It took time. Months. Enter small wins - from starting online businesses, a podcast, &amp; entering the stock market.

But shit like that don’t go away instantly. Especially in the pandemic. I was still grieving for a lot of losses, and I was beating myself up for a burnt-out sense of empathy. The news was just so dark everyday, and I couldn’t care anymore. Not forever, but I just couldn’t process it anymore. Hopelessness &amp; dread. I had to deal with all of those, to make sure that when I stop the medication, the depression won’t come back.

In a span of a few months, I’ve also practiced self-compassion, kindness, and then strengthening my empathy. And things do get better.

But progress isn’t linear either. Right now, as I type this, I’m on a hard relapse, with a few down in the past too. The sleeping patterns &amp; drinking on Holiday season, the lack of work to do, the stress with my laptop breaking down, and being on &amp; off medication has my shit imbalanced again. Everyone dealing with their own stuff &amp; unavailability of therapy has made it worse too. I’m almost one year in lockdown, and I won’t have my business &amp; friends for my birthday in the longest time. I have no appetite, my hormones are crashing, I can’t sleep, I’ve been drinking again, and I wanna die.

I’m crawling back again. But it will get better.

I share all of this, because this 2021, I’m hoping for a year of more kindness &amp; communication. A letting go of hate. I wish more people would stay close. Be vulnerable. Be more empathetic. Be sensitive. Cause it’s not just me. So many others are battling worse demons &amp; trauma. Some of them don’t even know it yet.

Our demons have played a huge part in our past, so now that we’re dealing with them &amp; looking forward - we’re finally becoming the people we ought to be.

Be thankful for everyone who stayed and will stay. Inspite of &amp; despite of.

We will get back &amp; conquer. Hold on loves.

373,I feel as if dating someone with a mental illness is not for everyone,I want to make it clear I am not very experienced with many realtionships. In fact I just got out of my first one. She did not tell me why she was leaving but the small things she did say I though about and I'm like oh she did not like me cause I suffer from anxiety and depression. Not a cohesive though just thinking.
374,Strength Within Pain (82),"Hurting. Pain. Sadness. We have all felt this before. We may be feeling it right now. We all have something that we can heal from. We all have something we can improve upon. **Together, Separately.** We all have something that makes us feel scare, that makes us feel fear and sometimes even allow the fear to overwhelm our mind and body. 

It is all ok. We are Sacred but we are Human. It all takes time. 

I have learned recently that there is so much **strength** with feeling your pain, feeling your depression, feeling your anxiety, feeling your hurt, feeling your sadness, feeling whatever emotion it may be, that is **trying** to make **YOU** think that you are not worthy, that you don't deserve, that you aren't strong enough........**WELL LET ME TELL YOU;** **THAT IS ALL A LIE**. Yes, our pain, sadness etc., is valid, but **THIS** is all a strength. Being in tune and one with our emotions, with how we feel, is the **GREATEST STRENGTH**; to **HEAL,** for **HAPPINESS**, for **PEACE.**

Through all of these emotions, we are **GROWING.** If you realize it or not, it is all happening inside &amp; I hear **YOU,**sometimes we expect growth to be something on the conscious level, where we would realize our growth, where we would realize the things we used to feel that we no longer do, or that now **EMPOWER** us. It takes time. I know. Its difficult but if **WE** start thinking in the way that this is apart of something **GREATER,** that this is **ALL** making **OUR INDIVIDUAL STORY,** we will begin to enjoy and be one with all these emotions, with these feelings and connecting with the **PRESENT** moment, which is all we truly have. **RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.**

Today: **BE kind on yourself. Give yourself a hug. I am rooting for you.**

**I love you.**

375,Lack of joy,"Hey everyone. I've been doing pretty suboptimally mentally for a while, but I guess I only fairly recently realized that I don't seem to find joy in anything anymore.

I don't feel happy when I'm with friends, I don't feel happy when I'm with strangers, I don't feel happy when I'm by myself, I don't feel happy playing videogames, I don't feel happy exercising, I don't feel happy playing with my dogs. I'm just sort of here.

So I guess I wanted to know if you guys have any tips to feel better or maybe a starting point from which to improve my mental health?"
376,I can’t get ahold of my doctors office. Not sure what to do,"I’ve been going to the same psychiatrist for about 4 years now I haven’t really had any issues with setting up appointments but for the past 9 months it’s been a huge pain. The office rarely answers the phones and it’s even more rare for them to call back- my bf recently started seeing the same doctor and has had issues with them charging him twice, forgetting about his appointments, etc. The doctor is amazing but it’s just the office that sucks. 



During the week before Christmas, I called and no one answered so I made an appointment online.... then they canceled the appointment within an hour and didn’t say why. After that my mom called 3 separate times and no answer, and of course they never called back. 




My depression has been a lot worse this month and I want to get tested for ADHD (boyfriend got diagnosed with it and I noticed that I have a lot of the same problems as him). 




I really don’t know what to do. I was thinking of just driving over there and seeing if I could talk to someone there to setup an appointment. 



Does anyone have any ideas on how to handle this?"
377,I used to self harm in a weird way and I still do it sometimes.,"I would bite down really hard on the joint of my thumb. It would cause me to bruise really bad, and my thumbs hurt a lot sometimes. It was an impulse, sometimes I really couldn’t control it. I’d also bite my arms a lot. Sorry this is short I just want to talk about it because I’m trying to stop."
378,Sometimes it’s just not fair is it,I have been through some shit in my life and believe me some of it is horrifying BUT the hardest battle I am facing is my own head! I CONSTANTLY second doubt every decision I make every conversation I have had every word someone speaks to me and i over think everything. I can deal with my past demons they have shaped the woman I am now. I feel like I am two different people! One half is scared of rejection terrified of not being accepted hating everything about how I look constantly feeling fat ugly all the negative things you can think of and I pick at myself all the time. Then there’s the other side of me this loud bubbly funny girl who takes sexy pictures and naughty videos and puts them on the internet! I mean how can I be these two completely different people. How can I feel like this and make it through a day my head doesn’t shut off. It’s not like this every day some days I am really ok and I am happy and make people laugh and I genuinely feel happy then there’s days like today. Today I’m not feeling good enough I can’t look in a mirror today days like today are mental torture for me I hate everything about myself and it absolutely tears me apart. This is such a random rant but just needed to get it out my heads a mess and I can’t fix it.

380,Seeking affordable online therapy from someone specializing in childhood trauma/addiction,"Hi all, I’ve gone to therapy at various points in my life and have had a few positive experiences. I’m currently in France but looking for a female American-based therapist. Someone who specializes in childhood trauma/neglect, adverse childhood experiences, etc. My mother is a heroin addict and my childhood experiences with her continue to dictate my present. 

I’m struggling to find resources when I do online searches. Side note, I have no insurance and unimpressive funds, so I will not be able to afford any $150/session type deals. 

Thank you for any suggestions"
381,Dealing with depression in my relationship,"Im (33M) really struggling with low mood, mild anxiety, poor self image and completely lack of motivation to do anything currently. I can decide if it’s due to my relationship or my mental health in general. 

I have been with partner (34F) for two years now, before I was single for 5 years after a 10 year relationship ended with my ex cheating. In those 5 years being single I became very happy with being by myself and dealing with any negative thoughts I might of had. I should also point out that I have always been happy with my own company and Im definitely an introvert.

During this past year I have noticed a marked decline in my mood, starting with the first U.K. lockdown. I work in health care but due to my own longstanding health problems I was unable to continue in my role. I have always helped people and not being able to do so during the biggest health crisis seen in generations was a large blow. As the year went on I put on weight and lost motivation to do anything about that, along side this my mood became darker and darker. I haven’t considered self harm but often have the urge to just disappear, just walk away from everything. 

Throughout this time my partner was working from home as her job moved to remote working. She struggled with her own low mood during the lockdown. I helped support her as much I could, as with most people I’m great at giving advice, terrible at following the advice I give to other!  I felt that I was unable to express my own problems as I didn’t want to add to her burdens. 

As the year came to a close her mental health was in a far better state than mine and I felt I could open up about how I was feeling. She seemed supportive but all her words of support appeared hollow to me. I feel dreadful when she tells me that I look good or that everything will be okay. I don’t think look good currently and I feel so low that I can’t see a way out of it.  When I have time alone I do feel calmer but I wonder if that’s just because she is not there  encouraging me to be better, so I don’t have to face my current feelings? 
I have been thinking about leaving but I have so many doubts about that, as when I’m having a ‘good day’ I genuinely enjoy being with her.  

I’m not expecting answers and in truth it has been cathartic just to write out how I see things at the moment.  Thank you for letting me vent."
382,Looking for help,"I currently work from home. I’ve been at home since late June, before it was pretty easy I woke up on time work my shift with little to no distractions so I was able to complete successful work days. But starting a couple weeks ago I’ve had to force my self out of bed and to work which is becoming so draining. I really just want to lay in bed I spend all of my free time laying in bed. Really I’m just wanting to know if anyone  has some suggestions or tips for someone struggling to find motivation to even leave the bed..... any suggestions would be great ❤️"
383,Need some advice,"Hi you guys!

So for a while, I (18F) have been wondering about some things I do and whether or not they're normal for neurotypical people. 

I tend to fixate on certain things, most often shows or certain fictional characters, and then obsess over them, typically for a few days up to a week. It's typically all I think about and interacting with it in any way makes me incredibly giddy and happy. I can still function normally, e.g do homework or study, and I can also keep myself from talking about it to people that wouldn't be able to even understand why I'm so obsessed. I do usually tell my friends about it though, it's very hard not to since I'm filled with all this excitement and need an outlet. It kinda feels like being in love, it's intoxicating. 

When I feel intense emotions (typically either stress or excitement) I chew my nails, I've done this since I was a child. Most of the time I don't notice. Loud or repetitive sounds irritate me and make me have aggressive, and I usually either have to make a repetitive movement myself or do something with my hands (like snipping my fingers or clapping/lightly slapping my arms) to distract myself and have an outlet for my frustration. This doesn't happen all the time though, there are times where I can tolerate sounds like this pretty well. It is just when I focus too much on the sound that it gets that way. Or when I want to concentrate and there's this sound. Same thing when there are too many sounds at once. 

I used to read like crazy (still do when I get the opportunity but nowadays I have less free time) and whenever I did I was so focused that I wouldn't notice anything anymore. 

Writing all this down I still feel weird about this, like I'm overanalyzing. I'm thankful for some insight!"
384,It Eats You Up,"Do you ever see a problem down the line? Already knowing that it’s going to eat you up inside? You can already sense the darkness that comes within it and you already know it’s going to take a *fight* to get over it. 

Holding onto that fiery anger is just like drinking poison and expecting someone else to die from it. Hatred has the ability to eat you up from the inside and because of that, you won’t even realise when you are left without a soul. You’ve blamed and self-hated yourself for too damn long, it’s been a long journey, it’s time we stop hurting ourselves physically and mentally and start again with life. 

We bring ourselves down too easily and too frequently. Everyday, we wake up in the morning and before we have the opportunity to open our eyes, we fill out minds and thoughts will self-hatred, doubt and fear. Why do we do this? Why do we fill our void will such hatred before we even leave the bed? This is the perfect definition of **allowing** the self-hatred to eat us up. 

At times, we need to give ourselves a break. Sure, you may not feel as if you deserve a break, but that’s the whole point, *that* in itself is self-hatred by doubting the person you are. Allow yourself to heal, allow yourself to grow and learn. If you don’t, you’re not going to improve. 

Just like myself, you need to allow yourself heal. Yes, it may take time, it may take some heart and all of your efforts, but it’s what’s needed. Believe you me, you’ll come out of this a much better person. I have all of my faith in you."
385,"Having really overwhelming urges to self harm, don’t want to though","It’s like I’ve got to have an out of the shit going on around me and trying to get my shit together. I’ve self harmed on an off for years, but it’s got to a point where my body can’t take anymore. I’m still recovering from what I’ve put my body through last year and that was a wake up call. 

But these urges I’m getting recently, I’ve scratched up my face some with hardly any nails to do so with and keep hitting myself and I don’t even want to. I’ve physically felt having something around my neck, like I had to do it. I haven’t though, because I know I don’t want to. 

I’m trying to figure things out mentally physically and emotionally by myself and I’m struggling so much with it. Hearing how I’m abusive and trying to control everybody almost daily from my parent is draining me. I’ve started snapping back at things that “aren’t meant to be upsetting” and saying shit I wouldn’t normally say because I’m so tired of how patronising they can be. It’s not blatantly obvious shit, and it sounds pathetic to be bothered by it. But when it’s all the time, things like being told I’m not listening and being asked to repeat what they said to prove I was, it fucks with you. Other things like: “I’m just joking, it wasn’t a thing but you’re making it” “I didn’t say that” “you’re calling me a liar” or “you said this and that” (literally this and that) and “well if I’m such a cunt” followed by something that I haven’t said or somehow making how they responded to how I was as a child onto me. 

I didn’t mean for this to be a rant about them or anything, but we’ve been arguing more again and whilst it’s normal I’m not used to unwanted self harm urges. I’ve wanted to in the past and I just did it. 

What can I do when I get like that? I know I don’t want to but sometimes I can’t make myself stop. I can’t leave the house, and there’s limitations on everything because of how I’ve had to deal with things. How do I not let myself get to the point where I do something and can’t stop myself? Really don’t know what to do. 

Thanks for any replies."
386,Nasty people on Reddit,"I posted something regarding the current virus. Just to vent really, and look for support in a subreddit for my country regarding covid. Mentioned things how we need a lockdown. Just saying my thoughts. 

Anyway, I posted this, and I was proceeded to be berated with I’m a nut job, I’m paranoid, and I need to get off the internet. That I am selfish act. 

I KNOW the internet is full of nasty people. I am not a child, I KNOW not to listen to people who are mindless on the internet and make comments. 

However I can’t help but feel sad by those comments. I just posted my thoughts, and needed somewhere to vent. I don’t trawl the internet looking for doomsday stuff about the current situation.

I posted my thoughts and got attacked for it. These people won’t be thinking twice about what they said. I am a long term sufferer of mental health. Had depression and anxiety for over 10 years. But I couldn’t help but get upset over it. 

Sorry for the rant."
387,anyone have any clue whats wrong with me?,"it feels like im slowly losing my mind and i have no idea whats going on. i started out paranoid and i couldn’t eat anything because i was scared i might get poisoned or something and every time i would eat a meal, id force myself to puke it up minutes later because id get scared. then i just started getting angry and i couldnt control it. i was breaking my own shit and hurting myself and i bit a chunk of my own skin off. after months of being so angry i thought i was gonna have a stroke, now i just feel distant. every person i know is like just a feedback loop of shit theyve been told in their lives and they arent actually coming up with any new genuine thoughts, therefore they arent real. i havent been able to care about anything. i feel like im the only real person who can put together real new thoughts. i cant get out of bed anymore. all i do 24/7 is think about killing myself. i feel like life just isnt for everyone. i got the worst genetic makeup. maybe im just the weakest link and naturally shouldnt be here."
388,"i’m at a really low point and i feel so lost, hopeless, and alone","i feel really confused. i feel as if i’m always pretending, rather than just living if that makes sense

ive been getting pretty bad panic attacks in the middle of the night and i nearly called the suicide hotline a couple months back because it felt like the world was ending and i just didn’t know what else to do.

sometimes i just wonder what i’m doing. i wonder if i’m making the right decisions and i get so anxious because i’m scared i’m going to end up hurting myself even more emotionally. i cope in unhealthy ways. i smoke or do other drugs thinking i’ll be able to figure something out. i’d say i haven’t self harmed in a few months but there’s other things that i’ll do to purposely hurt myself. 

i bottle up my emotions and rarely show vulnerability to others. because of this, things get really bad for me when i’m completely alone. all of the emotions are released and i cry so hard to the point where i feel nauseous and throw up. i try to avoid being alone for that reason.

i told my mom about a month ago that i’ve been having panic attacks and asked her if she could call a doctor. she seemed understanding but she’s done nothing. it was so hard for me to gather up the courage to tell her and i don’t feel capable of asking her again. i have twice. i’m only 17 so there’s not much else i can do.

i feel empty and frustrated with myself. i had a decent amount of friends last year and now i’m down to none. i have an entire one person i care about right now but it’s not consistent or even healthy and i don’t want to have to rely on one person like that or form an unhealthy attachment. i can never connect with people anymore because i never reach out or open up.

i try to keep myself busy so i can keep these thoughts away, but of course it doesn’t work. i enjoy painting and it helps sometimes, but my negative thoughts come back immediately after.

thanks if u read this i just needed to vent and can’t seem to vent to anyone i know in my life."
389,I feel very weird.,"Hi everyone! I want to start this off by saying that I feel like i SHOULD be content with my life. Yeah I stress about money and bills etc but otherwise i live a good life. Lately I’ve just felt very disconnected with everything, to the point nothing feels real and i feel so inside my head that when i’m talking to people i feel like i am on autopilot and not really tuned into the conversation. As well as this i just feel so out of place no matter what, i find myself wishing i didn’t exist but i strive to live a fulfilled life. I do not want to die or anything like that, but i just wish that i was simply never brought here i guess. i definitely have not felt very mentally well for awhile, and i want to fix that. I feel so conflicted and strange all the time, i just don’t feel like a person anymore. I’m so disconnected to the people that i love, and i just want to gain more satisfaction or meaning in my life. I honestly am posting this just to talk to people who have experienced feelings like this and what helps them with these feelings."
390,My best friend who has mental breakdowns have given up on themselves and can't get therapy," 

I suppose I should start with some back story. A long time ago I was going through the nastiest break up I've ever had and my mental health took a pretty hard hit. It was a little before the breakup happened where I met my current best friend. When the break up happened she was my biggest supporter and did so much to help me get better. We spent a lot of time together and grew very close, and without her I probably wouldn't have recovered as fast or as well as I did.

Pretty soon after we became friends she got a boyfriend. I was happy that she was able to have a smile on her face (since she has a pretty bad past. She loses a lot of friends, has been cheated on, and even been raped by one of her ex's). Knowing her terrible past, I was happy knowing she was happy.

I must admit, I was a little envious of her boyfriend. I actually did start to fall for her. She is the prettiest girl I know, and her natural instinct to always be there for her friends is something I love a lot about her. She is also the most socially smart person I know, able to pick up on any ques or hints. I love her quirks, her smile, her humor, just everything about her I am attracted too.

That said, her smile and her happiness is still more important to me, so because of that I supported her relationship with her boyfriend and I sort of let go of that crush I had. If she is happy with him then I want her to stay happy with him. That was my mindset. So we stayed best friends and our friendship stayed platonic.

Months and months past, and everything SEEMED good from where I was standing. I thought she and her boyfriend were always being happy together, however behind the scenes things started to get a little bit hairy. For one, I had no idea until just a few days ago that they started dating only 3 days after meeting each other. Afterwards, they started calling each other for (as she puts it) 20 hours a day, and ""when we weren't calling we were texting."" (For context, their relationship is long distance, almost on opposite sides of the US, and as for the 20 hours a day part it is because they are both staying at home doing school because of this covid situation and they even fell asleep together with their phones still on.) As you can imagine, this led to them becoming emotionally dependent on each other without them even realizing it.

I'm not quite so sure what else happened but it seems apparent that mistakes were made on both sides of the relationship to the point where, on New Year's Eve (of all times) her boyfriend lashed out and said that we (my best friend, our friends, and I) were the reason he wanted to ""disappear"" (or essentially hurt himself...you get the point). This was the final straw for my best friend, and she broke up with him later that day. After realizing what he (her now ex-bf) did, he tried apologizing but it was too late as the damage was already done.

The day after (New Year's Day) got even worse. The realization that she broke up with her bf finally started to kick in, and she started having a mental breakdown. For context, while her breakdowns aren't that often (once every few months) they are severe. She started saying things that didn't make sense and was having what seemed almost like a split personality. She kept saying stuff like ""I hate you I hate all of you,"" ""Its best if I hate you,"" ""Everything is fine, they will fix everything (dunno who she is referring to when she says ""they,"") ""I want to be his baby (despite JUST saying she hated him,)"" etc. All sorts of nonsense that didn't add up. I didn't buy it for a second she hated me or any of our other friends, so I snapped her out of it. I had to take control for a bit and eventually convinced her to delete Instagram (the app she was using to talk to her boyfriend) and convinced her ex to block her so she wouldn't be able to talk to him.

This got her calmed down a bit, and she ""sobered up"" from her insanity. She apologized for saying all the stuff she said, explaining she never meant what she said, she pretty much had no control. She said she thought it would be easier for me if I wasn't her friend, in a sense she wanted to ""protect you from myself."" I stayed with her the rest of the night, calming her down, making sure she took her sleeping pills, watched over her until she went to bed and said she could handle herself.

I talked to her ex (who still loves her) and convinced him that its best if he doesn't talk to her, if he blocks her so as to prevent another breakdown (since that last one was caused by them calling each other ""one last time."" I talked some sense into him showing that they needed time apart from each other even though they still cared for one another because they became mutually dependent and he agreed because he didn't want to see her have another breakdown nor did he want her to be fully dependent in a very unhealthy way on him.

She then later called me after she went to bed and cried over the phone, saying how much she missed him but also wanted him to be happy, thinking it was best for him if he forgot about her and moved on, but her saying that was also hurting herself. I stayed on the call with her until she was able to go to sleep again.

Now today (Jan 2, the day after what I just typed), she is still showing signs of dependency and has stated she has given up on herself (not on life, she said she wont hurt herself) but said that she isn't getting any better, that this is her normal self even before I met her. This broken, low self esteem, no motivation, sad version of herself and there isn't anything anyone can do to help her ""get better."" She keeps saying he (her ex) was her only motivation, and is still desperately wanting to call him in about a week, but I can't in my right mind advise her to do that as both of them need therapy. Like actually...they need fucking professional help.

It is disheartening because I feel like there is actually nothing I can do, like I have already lost a best friend because she has given up on herself. We still love each other (we have said I love you's before in a platonic way, and have recently been saying it more often.) Heck, if she mentally recovered and didn't get back with her ex I would want to ask her out, but again I care more for her happiness.

I am at a total loss though because it looks like there is nothing I can do other than just be there for her, sit and watch as she keeps saying she will never get better, where the one thing she wants will only hurt her even more. What is worse is she can't get therapy because for some ungodly fucking reason her parents are against it and won't pay for it, and I don't think they would even let me pay for it either.

Its clear she needs therapy, but won't be able to even receive it until she moves out in about a year and a half or so. Talking to her ex is like a drug in an unhealthy way, like giving a drug addict weed or an alcoholic more alcohol. And as much as I care for her and want to be there for her, I am not a fucking therapist, in fact if this keeps up I MAY just need my own therapy.

Is there any advise anyone can give? I came to reddit cause I have pretty much run out of ideas."
391,"Something I wrote for myself awhile ago, I thought I would share. Feel free to comment on what you'd like.","I am a very reminiscent person, sometimes happy memories make me sad. The emotions that come with memory can change depending on the context it’s retrieved. I like to think about the first time I met my best friend or that 2011 Christmas that I got the Wii I had been asking for. Those memories are good, they make me miss simpler times. 

Some memories are dark, they can control you without your knowledge. There’s one memory that I don’t think about, but other times it won’t leave my thoughts, like tonight. Before I write on that subject, a little backstory. 

My mother was arrested when I was two and to this day I have not met my father, I was passed around the majority of my upbringing. First to my 15-year-old sister, then when someone finally realized that was wrong I was given to her father in Arizona. I remained there with him and his wife until I was nine. I was removed from his home after he started patterns of drug abuse and made me sleep on the golf course, but that’s a story for another time. In 2011, I was living in Colorado with my brother, his wife, and my nephew until my sister moved there and I decided I wanted to live with her. 

I think it was something like 2013 when she found a husband and they bought a home together. He was not her usual type, he had a good job and he was country in a way. I loved my older sister, she was my mother figure. That was until my actual mother got out of a halfway house and decided to live with us. Here I was eleven years old meeting my mother for the first time. I was excited because I had no idea what she was like, just the images made up in my mind. My mother is beautiful, she has long, dark brown hair, brown eyes, and freckles. Just like me, but she’s rocking it, to be honest. 

My mother was neglectful in a way that was so perfect for her. I had these la te da daydreams about her my whole life and here was my opportunity to be loved by her. I know now that she uses that to play me and get this, it still works. Instead of trying to repair the damage of not being there for eighty percent of my life, she chose only to “repair” me with scoldings and punishments. I never really said this because it sounds dramatic and I know she would hate it, but my mother was verbally, mentally, and physically abusive. I won’t get into the details of her punishments mostly because I can’t, but I believe that statement is a fair evaluation of how she treated me. I was scared of her. 

Now that the situation has been explained a little bit we can get into what’s bothering me tonight. A memory that really has messed me up in so many ways. I was in sixth grade and I was going to this fancy charter school that made us wear khakis and things were going alright for me. My mother had moved out for a short period so my life was a little easier. 

One night my sister, her husband, and his dad went to the bar for a little while. I stayed home to watch *What Would You Do* and eat ramen noodles because well, I was pretty simple. When they had gotten home my sister immediately went upstairs to take a bath. I was still on the couch watching tv with her husband and his dad for maybe another fifteen minutes. Then his dad went to bed. 

I was not prepared for what happened next and thinking about it is like watching a horror movie when you know the main character is about to die. Her husband got up and started teasing me which was normal and I was mildly irritated because I was trying to watch TV.  So I got up and walked to the kitchen to grab a snack. He followed me and cornered me in front of the counter. For a second I thought he tried to kiss me but I managed to move away and got back to the couch. I sat down and try to read what had just happened when he comes and stands in front of where I was sitting. Unexpectedly he aggressively rips open the button and zipper of my khaki pants and I was so confused and I kept yelling for him to stop. He continued by starting to unzip his jeans. Then I was not playing any more and I started kicking him and screaming for my sister, she didn’t come. 

I could tell that my screaming had freaked him out because he just started apologizing and asking what I wanted. He told me I could have anything, but I didn’t want anything. All I could think of was how I was going to get up and tell my sister. I didn’t move I just sat there crying with my pants unbuttoned listening to him squirm. He asked me to trust him, to let him rebutton my pants I just said no. 

After what felt like years, my sister came downstairs and saw us sitting next to each other while I was in tears. She asks what’s going on and he tells her that we were just having a heart-to-heart. I said nothing and she says that it was probably time for me to go to bed. I went upstairs and locked my bedroom door behind me and cried. 

The next morning I woke up for school and he had gotten me a coffee, something I only got occasionally. That day was scary, I hated the feeling of being confused and overwhelmed like I was. I vividly remember sitting on the gym floor while my classmates played dodgeball, thinking. I was terrified, I didn’t know if I could tell my sister or weather It was even something people would care about. I knew it was wrong and I knew things like this happened to girls, but I never thought it would happen to me. 

He picked me up from school that day. It wasn’t long until he started talking about how he decided since I was maturing that he shouldn’t tickle or play fight with me anymore. Then continued to say that my sister didn’t need to know. I didn’t know what to do, I could ruin their marriage if I told her. Besides, It’s not like he actually raped me. 

That was my mentality, that it wasn’t a big deal and it wasn’t worth the conversation. Close to every time he got drunk he would crawl into bed with me and spoon me. Wake me up to have heart to hearts and ask if I trusted him (I didn’t). Sometimes I would run away and lock myself in the bathroom and he would pick the lock. 

It was the winter of my freshman year when a rumor started spreading at school that I lied about being raped. I confronted the person spreading it saying that they could get my family in trouble and I could get moved again. My mom found the message and of course asked about it and she would not let it go. So I told them about it all and they responded well originally. My mom said that we would probably have to go live alone. I made the mistake of sharing that information and she saw that as attention-seeking. 

So the energy shifted. Now It was protect my sister’s husband’s energy.  At twelve in the morning, sitting at the kitchen table alone I watched them all turn against me. He denied everything, I was the liar. They were scared that he was going to get arrested because of some of the knowledge my friends had on the situation. They decided he and I could not live under the same roof while the rumors were going around.  They sent me to live with my brother again, they said it was temporary but it wasn’t. 

I am graduating this year and I don’t really think about this as often. I like to tell myself that I’ve grown past it and I am fine. I recently started speaking consistently with my mother and sister again and it was really good at first. They seemed remorseful, but the color fades and I still see that they are basically unbothered by this horrible thing. I’ve had a conversation with her husband, he knows that I am doing well. 

I wrote this tonight because it obviously still bothers me. I don’t know if I’ll ever share this with anyone, but I might so that someone knows it’s real. I want someone to read this and know that he lied and this happened, that I kept this secret for all the wrong reasons, that when I told my secret I was called the liar. I want whoever reads this to know that I am terrified of being intimate with anyone and I don’t know how to fix it because I can’t talk about it without sounding like a broken record. I am so scared sometimes. When I think of this memory I feel scared, like that twelve-year-old girl sitting on the gym floor."
392,Helping someone who needs help,"Hello everyone 💜, I just need your advice in what I could do to help someone get help even though they are not willing to do so.. They don’t really believe in therapy and all but I feel like they rely on me to help them out however I feel like it gets draining for me. I tried telling them to seek help but they refused and now i’m not sure what to do .."
393,the self loathing is really getting me now,"i feel like when it comes to my depression, my mood isnt really affected too much. (dont get me wrong, i still consistently feel like shit, but its not a cant-even-get-out-of-bed feeling) what really gets me is the feeling of worthlessness. i hate myself so much. i cant even bear to look at myself in a mirror. i feel that anyone who is even my friend right now is doing so out of pity. i honest-to-god believe that there are no redeeming qualities about me."
394,why does this keep happening?,"hi i'm 17 and have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and am taking anti-depressions. recently i've been noticing something with me. i start panicking when i'm hot (like taking hot showers or working out) and i start hyperventilating. i also randomly start screaming ""no"" over and over out of no where. i panic for no reason like today when i was changing my clothes i started overthinking random stuff like did i turn off the stove earlier? and freaking out over literally nothing and trying to come myself down. i wouldn't call them panic attacks or anything like that. i tic a lot as well. 

sometimes i start freaking out like today i was like ""what time is it"" and panicking but i didn't have any plans and no where to go but out of no where i started freaking out. i did this one time when i was having an anxiety attack where i somehow convinced myself that i would die in my sleep. and i was crying over it cuz i didn't want to die. and it's so weird like it came out of no where and i started freaking out. my question is this my anxiety or something else?"
395,PLEASE READ I like actually need really really with this,"Okay, this happens to me sometimes, and idk wassup with that. I remember experiencing this from a young age. And its very hard to explain but I will try my best. I am very over not knowing wassup. 

Okay, a few thing happen.
One of those is that sounds I hear and my thoughts are going to ""sound"" weird. But at the same time it's still the same. What I mean my weird is that it atleast feels like, how it would feel like when you need to finish like 10 questions on a test with only 60 seconds left. And you just need to HURRY HURRY HURRY. And write down as much as possible. 
What I also mean by weird is that it sounds like how the flashing lights in clubs look like. And then I mean the light that go on and of quickly, so movements look like pictures. I hope that make sense. The light goes from very bright to completely off. You know?
Then my head feels like the TV static you could see on those old TVs. And my thoughts look like there is a layer of that static over my thoughts. Like a filter. 
It feels like I think in slow-motion. But it also feels like my thoughts are racing.
I can almost hear the ""TV static of my thoughts"". And it also makes me feel like my thoughts are very loud. Like it's screaming.
My fysical movement feels weird too. The same weird as I experience my thoughts and sounds at that moment. 

It often comes with this image in my head. It's a  view, from above a part of a road I know, always from the same angle. And it's like I am watching a time-lapse. And I see al the cars driving in different directions. But it also feels like its in slow-motion. 

It's just really weird. 

When this all happens I get really uncomfortable and anxious. Maybe even a little scared. 

This all happens at the same time. It just randomly starts. All of it. And time passes, and it ends. 

I dont like it when this happens and I am quite confused about it. I have no clue how to describe what happens. Like I can not find the words. There are no words to actually describe what happens, and what it feels like. So I hope someone maybe reads this weird ass thing and idk maybe recognise it? 

It doesn't really effect my life a lot. But it's been happening for over +10 years. (I'm 20). 
Also I have ADHD, so that might help? 

I also have PTSS, anxiety and I had depression almost my whole life. But that might me less relevant. Idk.
Thanks for reading"
396,Severe anxiety when thinking about school,"Well hello guys.

I, a male at age 17, have a really big problem which i don´t know how to solve.

Since i was 13 or 14 years old I had crazy panic attacks when thinking about school or anything related to it.

This sometimes leads to me falling into a constant shock, which lasts for hours.

Most of the times it happens, if I have to do any homework, or if there´s something to learn for.

This is especially bad if it is a subject or some kind of topic I have literally no interest in at all.

If that is the case it feels like my body just denies doing anything, and it´s only getting better, if I say to myself ""I will do it later, maybe in 2 hours"" and 2 hours later the same thing happens again. This often leads to me standing in the bathroom, thinking about things, and doing nothing else for hours, staying up until 1 to 3 am, when the pressure finally breaks me and I do it though not very well.

Not only that, almost everyday I have to go to school, I start panicking in the bus, my body starts sweating and my heart beats at a ridiculous rate and I don´t even know why. I never had bad grades, I am getting along with almost everyone at school, even the Teachers are all good in their own way.

This was ok to me, I mean it is very cancerous, but I managed to torture myself through every year until now.

I live in germany and here every school closed because of corona, what means that everything we would´ve done in school I have to do at my home, but I really can´t and now i am sitting on very tall mountains of homework and school is starting in two days, which makes these panic attacks like they´re on steroids, and my grades start to worsen.

Now i don´t now what to do. Should I leave school, I mean I already have a degree, but with this degree i can´t go to college what makes me really sad because I know I am not dumb and I know I have a much greater potential and now I am feeling like I am a disgrace to my brother and my family, who always said that I had to do this, because he regrets not doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don´t know what to do know.

Any help no matter how much, would be greatly appreciated.

And sorry if my language is messed up somehow."
397,[Research/$20 if Selected] How is your political life impacted by your mental health? SEEKING BLACK/POC PARTICIPANTS,"**Who I am:** Allison S. Reed, PhD Candidate

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago, Department of Sociology

**Supervisor:** Kristen Schilt, PhD

**Target group:** Those with chronic mental health concerns broadly. Specifically looking for BIPOC (Black, indigenous, people of color) participants for this round of the study, but white participants are welcome.

**Compensation:** This screener survey isn't compensated, but if you are selected and invited for an interview, the interview will be compensated at $20. The screener helps me build up a diverse pool for the interviews, from which I can then select a balanced group of interviewees.

**Link:** You can access the screener survey here: [https://ssd.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_8BotZ0y8QBWcCYR](https://ssd.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8BotZ0y8QBWcCYR)

**Background:** This survey is part of my doctoral dissertation in sociology. What role does mental health play in the ways you do (or don't) engage with activism? What about other types of political activity?

Have discrimination or inaccessibility ever made it harder to engage? Have supports made it easier?

If you have thoughts on questions like these, please take part in my dissertation study. I am investigating how health and wellbeing relate to political life, identity, and action. Right now, I am focusing on chronic mental conditions.

**Link to results:** For consenting interviewees, their edited transcripts will ultimately be posted on thelivingactivismproject.wordpress.com. You can also learn more about the project here.

Thanks! Please circulate if you know anyone else who might be interested--they don't need to have mental illness, just willigness to talk about the intersection of mental health and political life."
398,Are there long term alternatives to benzos?,"I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit, 
I have pretty severe social anxiety disorder without gad or depression. 

I want to clarify that I mean is there long term and safer medication that is chemically similar to benzodiazepines?

I’m intolerant to ssris, It’s not that I don’t like the side effects or they don’t help me, I’m medically unable to take them. I was on a tetracyclic for 5 months and it did help me sleep but it made me feel more anxious and stressed. Secondly, I tried bupropion and it made me sicker too; however I was able to tolerate both. I’ve also tried a tca (although it was trazodone so take that with a grain of salt) 

I have tried propranolol and it sounded exciting but after a while I realized it made me tired and depressed.

The reason I ask this is because of everything I’ve tried Clonazepam is my miracle medication, not even one side effect. With this being said I’m fully aware that it’s not as safe and has the potential for abuse. I wish I could take it every day but I know I can’t. Moreover, doctors are incredibly hesitant to prescribe it and I’m wondering if there’s anything chemically similar (nervous system depressants or something) that can help anxiety. I’ve been looking into antipsychotics but I’m not sure."

400,Negativity and anxiety,"I've always been a pretty optimistic and positive person. About 1 1/2 years ago my toddler son became very ill due to a virus and spent about 2 weeks hospitalized, 1 of which was in PICU (he has been thankfully healthy since that time). After that I developed alot of anxiety related to what happened to him, as well as health/safety in general (mostly related to him, but also just overall fear/anxiety). A lot of it was the loss of control over and inability to feel ""safe."" I recognized the change in myself and saw a therapist until March when everything shut down. I was feeling relatively able to handle things by then and felt ok to discontinue. 

Obviously, since March (in US) things have been a total shit show. Where I live is basically the epicenter now and I am so full of fear, anger, and anxiety all the time. The negativity I feel toward everyone who refuses to do what is necessary to help others is so strong. The negativity I feel toward out government - starting at the top- and it's utter failure is so strong. We haven't seen family in a year and who knows when we will be able to. By the time it's safe, who might we lose before then? I'm just so sick of feeling scared and angry. It feels like it's been so long since there was something that was just pure good that happened. Or something to look forward to. 

I have 2 kids and try my best to keep things moving for them. I don't like this person I see myself becoming- who is resentful toward others that don't seem afraid. I feel this has all changed my outlook on people as a whole; I would always be quick to give someone the benefit of the doubt and now I feel like I look around and see so much selfish, ignorant behavior and am just left feeling betrayed by what my perspective was before this. 

I guess this is a vent...idk really. I feel like there is so much going on all the time in my head and don't understand how everyone isn't feeling this way right now (which frustrates me too)."

I cry almost everyday. i just want this hell to end. i cant go on being unhappy, but i cannot form the words to talk to anybody about it, it’s just impossible. i have never had a friend i really trusted and the thought of that makes me sad. i have no friends now. i have done my share of cutting before on my chest and forearms, i hit myself sometime, completely explode verbally , i don’t know what to do man. i cant kick my weed addiction of 2 years or my nicotine addiction. i have experimented with psychedelics and alcohol. i have alcoholic parents but i don’t like alcohol. i like getting stoned like my life depends on it. i wake up everyday, feeling naked, blue and cold, like i have no name, and i think about my 0 friends. i say i’m gonna kill myself all the time. almost everyday. but out of impulse. but it’s everyday. everyday feels like the same waste. i write and play music and that’s really the only center of attention in my life. i sit in my dark strobe lit room all day watching netflix, getting high, maybe playing an hour a day, as opposed to when i didn’t smoke it was 3-4 . but also it would be 3-4 hours when i smoked sometimes too. i’m just sick of feeling like nothing. i have no obligation to anything."

But I've never done them, like it's not possible because I remember almost every detail, and there's no way that stuff actually happened because it's completely illogical or impossible to happen. Not crazy stuff like seeing unicorns.

407,"Is my mom going insane,how can I help her?","I've decided to vent here in hope that I may recive some advice. 

In summary, she is 41, in 2015 she started taking antidepressants (called Asentra) prescribed to her by a family psychiatrist after my uncle's (her husband's brother) death.  I don't know the exact dose. Along the way, I, her daughter, developed a sever case of teenage depression. (started about 2015, but my family noticed in 2018 when I was at my lowest, I was diagnosed some time later)
She continued taking her meds (i pressume because of what was happening with me) Now it's been solid 5 years and she is still taking them every day.

That wouldn't be alarming to me (nor my dad) if it weren't for the change that has happend with her. 

All of thoes sympthoms have been around for more than 4 years:

-she uses escapism a lot (internet) she can literaly make her family cry during an argument that she has started and then go back to watching Netflix and laugh out loud at some show 2 minutes later

-she is not able to have a conversation with my dad without picking on him, blaming him or sometimes even hitting him (afterwards she claims she didn't do any of it)

-she avoids talking about her feelings, often starts arguments when anybody tries to talk to her, she riddicules us and starts going of about how we are all vicous and mocking her (we really are not, I was making sure with my therapist multiple times whether what we have been saying to her was abusive or blaming her)

-she puts on a fasade of a happy, jolly middle-aged woman but it's so obvious that she is lost. She laughts a lot and always jokes around, she can not calm down

-she can not sleep at night and claims that it is normal and even 'notable' and 'parisable' because she is very hardworking (i feel weird typing this..but...she's not hardworking at all, it just feels like she thinks that because of how emotionaly burdening every of days is)

-sleeps during the day, everyday for at least 4 hours and claims that it is normal :(

-is very tired after every social interaction

-lies to my therapist about how's the situation at home looking (i know she doesn't mean to lie tho) she is always trying to paint a perfect picture and claims that she has control over her life

-she ignores my lil brother (9yo) when he wants to talk about his feelings and tells him he is just weird and should shut up (she did the same to me and I stopped talking to her)

-claims that she is fine and well and if someone suggests that she seems unwell she says that they must be insane themselves to make such assumptions (she told me multiple times that I am just stupid or clueless) 

-constantly tired, problems with memories and expressing her thoughts

-doesn't have any hobbies, doesn't do anything for herself, cut off her friends

-she often says irrational and conflicting things, doesn't listen to us talking, gets mad over nothing and comes up with irrational explanations. And it is currently imposible to talk to her.

I love her so much, I an worried about how she abuses my dad (he is a sweet and very emotionaly intellegent guy) and how the whole situation is affecting my brother (he cries frequently). Should we contact her psychiatrist? What should we tell him? How should I talk to my mom? 

I feel like it's important to mention that her brother has some kind of schizophrenic disorder and her father has Altzheirmer's."
408,"Narcissistic Mother, Adult sister with drug psychosis, pathetic suicidal father and me with crippling anxiety and PTSD. Seeking advice to protect myself while helping my family","Hi guys
Last night my sister reached out for help during a psychosis episode. She's been treating me like her personal garbage bag for weeks and I finally had enough and silently faded away after an abhorrent Xmas day. 

I rang my mum who was drinking and with friends and couldn't hear me or read her phone.  
My dad threatened suicide ( and told me I'd be attending 2 funerals this week) because she's upset over a woman(my age in 30s) that's using him and refused had to deal with it (he's been hospitalized after 4 unsuccessful attempts) over the last 10 years and living across country in the middle of no where.

I've spent this year on and off work due to PTSD after an emergency incident at work just a week after finding out my sister had attempted suicide and was just woken from an induced coma back in January 2020

I'm mentally unstable with my anxiety and PTSD (and ADHD) with an INFPT personality type. I don't have enough gas in the tank to look after myself let alone all this extra stress

I'm unemployed for the first time in my life. Been living independently since 17 and working since 14.

I can't just cut them off. I want to, I really want to. I've had no support and everyone just expects I'll be there. I can't do it any more and don't know how to fix it.

I've set boundaries but they don't care and walk all over me. I'm fine looking after myself, why can't they be? How do you dismiss the guilt and ignore all the toxicity? I'm drowning in an ocean of shit and no one around me cares about anyone but themselves."
409,Being mentally ill sucks and I’m worried I’m rejected for being me.,"


I [24M] feel bad for not having a car. I’m worried she’s turned off cuz I don’t have one? She’s in her mid-late 30s...


Well I have an anxiety disorder and I had some moments of calm last night but I was also anxious. Apparently some guys claimed that it shows I’m ‘immature’ and ‘she’s turned off’. One woman said I’m a dick cuz genuine woman sill don’t want to ‘taxi me around’. But other women on here have said I am mature cuz I’m self-aware, kind, and caring. 

I hope those outweigh not having a car? To be fair she said months ago when we started talking it didn’t matter but recently she said:

&amp;gt; You still don’t have a car?

Apparently she used to live ~10 minutes way when she offered to pick me up but now it’s ~15.

And to be blunt I worried cuz I couldn’t tell if she was disappointed cuz she felt bad for me or disappointed cuz she was upset and maybe thought bad of me... *however*, during our interactions and phone calls she seems genuinely happy and invited me over, winked at me, said I’m a good person, I make her laugh, etc...

I thought about apologizing but I wanna call her and clarify I didn’t hang out cuz anxiety and hope she accepts me for me.

I kinda want to cry and I don’t even know why I don’t have a car. For awhile I was worried about getting into an accident and dying or hitting someone with my car or getting pulled over after smoking weed... which I probably wouldn’t do but still.

Don’t even know what to think.

410,How to enjoy alone time with anxiety?,"So it’s really difficult for me to be alone. I’m a natural extrovert, first of all. But my mental health problems exaggerate my issues. 

I have anxiety and ADHD . Being alone leaves me time to worry, and one of my most problematic ADHD symptoms is emotion dysregulation. I worry mostly about friendships and my relationship. I worry and worry and worry over nothing, because there’s no one there to distract me or reassure me that I’m not completely alone in the world. I feel entirely abandoned if somebody’s not constantly messaging or calling me. 

I try to distract myself with reading or watching movies or my other hobbies but there’s always just a pit of anxiety in my stomach that makes it impossible to immerse myself in the activity. 

Why am I alone right now? Is it because everyone hates me? Why hasn’t X texted me in 3 hours? Does she hate me now too? Did I say something? Oh god, what if she’s hurt? Everyone hates me. What if they want to leave me? 

The only thing that fully distracts me are self-destructive behaviours like skin-picking and hair-pulling which are causing me health problems. I’m so dependent on other people and I don’t know how to just be alone peacefully. It doesn’t even have to be happily, just not miserably. 

I used to love being alone, but then I had experiences with people that gave me an extreme fear of abandonment. This pandemic is impossible and not being able to see people is making every day so difficult. Any advice would mean the world."

413,In a relationship with someone who has a major depressive disorder,"So...Ive been dating someone these past few months that ive known for quite a long time, but not about what they struggle with personally. So yes I know I should talk with them about it and I am the next time I see them. But what I have a hard time understanding is when they talk about Disassociating for a period of time. I looked it up and sure enough I spooked myself. Im willing to put everything I have in me towards them...I just need a bit of uhhh guidance. So one I dont freak them out and two I dont freak myself out."
414,Keeping a journal,"I would really recommend that anyone who hasn’t already get a journal - mine has got me through 2020’s awfulness, and I’m so glad I have it. Tonight, I’d convinced myself that things would never get better. But then I looked at an entry from last year (when I had finally found real happiness but my best friend was depressed) and it said this:

‘Seriously - all I’m good for is giving her random snippets of pep talk, and that’s it. It must sound so fake. But I’ve been there! I’ve felt that overwhelming dread, the exhaustion and boredom and pointlessness of everything. How do I convince her that it can all go away? Because that’s what I always knew, and it’s what kept me going, even if I really didn’t feel like it would ever be true. I just want her to keep going. I want her to come through the other side. She’s going to be so happy one day. I know it.’

I realised how what I said to her could now apply to me. I remembered the huge capacity for happiness I have, the bad times I’ve pushed through, the good times which have made all my horrible depressive episodes worth it. 

Journals are great for venting and getting it all out, but I’d argue they’re even better for reminding yourself of everything beautiful about life. I write in my journal every time I feel safe or content, or I have a good conversation with a friend, or I see something that makes me smile. The funny thing is, I don’t even realise how powerful any of it is until the time comes when I need it most. 

Hope everyone has a wonderful year. I know you’ll all be so happy one day."

I just don't know what to do. I don't want to take care of myself because I want to die. A part of me feels so sorry for my family and loved ones &amp; another part of me still wants to die so bad. This is my chance. When I went to take care of my ear by this doctor (cause it was free etc &amp; i told myself why not) this dr felt something was wrong &amp; then said ""I don't want anything to happen to you &amp; looked at me in such a caring way it made me feel so bad"" It could be nothing is really wrong with me but I'm pretty sure I will die now if I keep up starving myself etc. I just hate life so so much."
417,My mental health,"Hello. Im going to take you back nearly 20 years to 2001. 2nd March 2001. The day I was born. The day I, a simple, pure, unpainted canvas was put on to the world. A baby, someone who needed love, care, attention and guidence. Paitenece and understanding. But a baby who would never recieve these things. 

Since I was a very young child, my older sister, born August 1999, was always my parents favourite child. She got everyones attention. I took the blame for anything wrong she did, and she always felt the need to hit me, to make me do shit because she couldnt be bothered. And dare I say no, or defend myself.

Meanwhile, In school, I was the odd child out. I didnt like sports, I never understood the other kids, I always so sensative. So I never had many friends. My sister had all the attention and she loved it. She had the strength to do it I guess. Primary school was the easiest it ever got for me. Easiest it would ever get for me. 

2012. I was 11 years old, I started high school. And since the day I did, the kids saw me as an easy target. Bullied each day because they knew no one would stand up for me, and I didnt have the guts to stand up for myself. So I'd sit there and take it. Trying to impress my father back home, but he would tell me what a bad son i was, that I was useless. 

October 2012 my mum moved out and my parents split. I discovered the most of my childhood my mum was an alcoholic and my dad was a physical abuser. My mum used drink to get over it. My dad lost his punchbag, and who was left to take the punishment? Me. But he was never physical. His punishments came mental:

""You're pathetic"" ""You're ugly"" ""No one will ever want a family with you"" ""No girl will ever love you"" ""No girl will ever want to look pretty and impress you"" ""You're a mistake"" ""You're not my son"" ""I'd chuck you through the window, except it means something to me"" ""If you dont find your coat, dont bother coming back at all""

Words I will carry like scars for the rest of my life. I was still getting hit by my sister, and she seemed to find it funny that kids bullied me in school, as she was popular she ahd influence and would spread things about me, people would bully me for shit that wasnt even true. It was hell, I was awake until I passed out each night to have a few hours in which I could be me, or at least try. I had tried to kill myself a few times at this point.

16th December 2014 I decided to run away from my dads and live with my mum. The 17th 2 am, I did just that. I remember the cold concreate and the muffled sounds of my tears as I sat on the pavement free. At 4 am and a police ride home I got to mums. The morning came and I awoke, he and her were on the phone. He didnt believe I was scared, I gripped that phone and told him. 

My dad was always perfect to my sister, so she never understood why I ran away. So the bullying got worse at school, I started to self harm and she cut contact from me and my mum the following Feburary. A few months after that he started shouting abuse at me from his car whilst I waited for the school bus, in the end we got a police restraining order against him.

2017 came. I stopped cutting, focused on my college. Discovered the band Blue October, realised I wasn't the only person feeling these things. That you could get help, medication to feel normal and happy. Went and told my mum, who told me I was copying the lead singer, and that I was fine and normal. Something that she sticks with to this day. 

2019 I started my uni course. That November my mum tells me shes back in contact with my sister, which lasted a week, it threw me off the rails and I fell into a deep, deep depression. I failed my first year as a result. July 2020 I had a breakdown, told my mum I failed and the reasons why. She shouted at me, one of my biggest triggers. But she says she cant help, its just who she is. Yeah, sure. 

I was allowed, at last, to get help from the doctors, diagnosed with depression and anxiety, given medication. My mum still told me I was making it up. That September I moved out. I realised this was my chance to sort everything as much as possible thats broken with me. That inclsued the hallucinations. Of course my mum hated it.

This breakaway due to Covid and the added independence of battling these conditions lead me to want to be more alone. And my mum didnt like it and tried controlling me. It was adding pressure and making me feel suicidal as hell. So I chose that I wanted December just gone to heal myself. To get better. My mum hated this, she couldnt possibly not talk to me for a single month and influence my every decision. She always tries to convince me not to get recorded help. I clearly need it. 

My nan, her mum, decided to get invloved. We agreed my mum wont contact me unless its responding or an emergancy. Inreturn I send 2 weekly texts so she knows Im okay. Fair deal. This lasted on her end for 2 whole days. very frustrating, it then worked for about one week. Then I had my psychiatrist appointment. 

I was told I have mild schizophrenia likely brought on by childhood trauma and isolation. The psychiatrist prescribed me antipsychotics, as our deal I tell my mum.Who ignored me for an hour and ahlaf and told me the meds were gonna kill me, make my head blow up and make me fat. She yet again tried to convince me to not take the meds, after trying to convince me to cancel the appointment. 

I told my nan, grandad and aunt, my only other family left. They're even fed up with my mums bullshit behaviour towards me. I feel so alone, unloved, unwanted and unworthy. I just want friends, a place to belong, a place to be me. A girlfriend to love, cherish and protect, and her do the same to me. But maybe I'm not worthy. Maybe lifes not for everyone."
418,Do you sometimes ask yourself “do I deserve all these blessings?”,"Sometimes I feel that I have so much blessings that I can never count but I don’t know if I deserve them... (perfect family, relatively healthy body, great education and so much more) do I deserve this? How can I begin to thank god and how do I show my appreciation for all those endless blessings that so many less fortunate dream of having?"
419,Not sure what to do about this kind of anxiety I'm feeling.,"Lately I've been having tons of anxiety about death and mortality. I think it started when my friend told me about his father going to the hospital due to catching covid, this was about two weeks ago and since then my anxiety has just gotten worse. 

I just cannot stop thinking about death. Mostly I keep focusing on the unknown of the afterlife and what happens. Even as I type this I feel so silly feeling this way but I don't know how to feel better, I feel almost depressed because of it like I don't want to do anything because I can't stop thinking about how we will all just....die one day and be gone

Does anyone else feel like this? Or have advice on how to feel better? I want to talk to my family or a friend about it... But I'm scared of how they'll think of me because of it. And with my industry being shutdown due to covid and I'm home all the time I feel like it just makes me spiral even harder with these feelings.

Thank you for letting me rant for a minute"
420,"Its a little triggering, but i dont know how to approch this situation?","I think I low key got sexually harrassed by my grandma, this one time she came to me crying to me because she was sad she had to move back to asia to continue working and she was worried about me and my siblings, so I was talking to her about it and she gave me a hug afterwards (this entire time I got the fucking weirdest vibes I have ever felt come from her I was uncomfortable as shit) while we where hugging she gave me a wet kinda kiss on the neck and I have never felt more disgusted. Afterwards I scrubbed my skin raw and I am not looking forward to her coming back to see me, everytime I think about it I am repulsed by it, idk what the fuck to think she's not at all a bad person but that shit was nasty I spend weeks trying to forget it but I still remember and I hate it. I'm not sure if this is funny or not, I'm a 15 y fem."
421,Any good documentaries about mental health?,"Are there any good documentaries out there that cover mental health related themes including anxiety, depression, addiction, and psychiatric treatment?"
422,"Counselling has done nothing to help, and now I can't help but resent counsellors because I feel like they take advantage of clients for profit.","First of all, I am not saying that seeking counselling is a bad thing. Not at all. Please, if you're in need of help, reach out to someone. Secondly, I'm sorry for how long this is. 

With that being said, I have had some fairly bad experiences with counsellors over the years. I have gone through phases; ups and downs really. My ""up"" phases (I'm currently in one now), have been completely due to my own initiative and efforts. I've seen the same therapist for almost 2 years now, and until recently, I made absolutely no progress whatsoever. I found a book that really helped me in dealing with my anxiety and depression, and I started a new spiritual practice that has really been a great benefit to my self-esteem. None of the changes I have made are due to his advice or guidance.

He stuck with the same approach for 2 years, constantly repeating the same talking points and offering the same exact solutions. Even though I expressed to him that I didn't think it was working and that I actually felt like I was getting worse, he didn't once deviate from his approach and continued to push the idea that his approach would work in the long run- despite the fact that I was noticeably getting worse. 

It got to the point where I started cancelling my appointments because I was annoyed that I had to continue paying him for the same rehashed, pre-recorded spiel about being kind to myself and coming to terms with my trauma. While those are undeniably important, he never gave me any sort of practical tools or actions to apply. It was literally like the stereotype of the psychologist saying ""and how does that make you feel?"" to everything. I FEEL LIKE SHIT, KEVIN. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. 

I have asked him several times for a visual representation of 1) what he believes the path forward will look like, and 2) the issues I have brought up and how we will eventually get around to addressing them. It's been almost 3 months and he has not provided me with anything. 

Now, I have had a really great therapy experience as well. I spoke with a relationship counsellor in my last relationship and she was awesome. She was active, she was bringing up tough topics that needed to be addressed, she switched approaches when she realized the first one wasn't working. She was great, and I'm very thankful for being able to have seen her. But the other two therapists I've seen have not helped me at all. I'm a very open and motivated person; I'm willing to try anything, and I've done everything they've asked of me. Yet they didn't help me in the least. 

I'm not sure what to do. It doesn't seem like therapy -- or at least some forms of it -- are helpful to me, and my lack of progress has made me weary about pursuing another counsellor. How do I move forward with this?"
423,Why do I feel weird sometimes?,"I can’t really explain it. My mind is just all over the place, I can’t settle down and do just one thing, I am restless, pacing, and it always happens after an event that creates some kind of emotion in me. It feels like anxiety to be honest which is weird, why would I be anxious the day after something happens? It’d be different if I was just recalling the good or bad day I just had but it’s not that, I barely even think about that day but still I feel anxious about it. It’s as if something happened in that day that subconsciously I’m hung up on and can’t figure it out and my mind can’t get it straight as to how it should be feeling. Like I said, it’s hard to explain. It has happened after many different things, good and bad. It is really irritating to be honest and will last for days and disrupts my entire day. I can’t think straight or do much of anything aside from sleep. I try to watch tv but can only sit down and keep focus for a couple shows."
424,I'm sorry if this isn't mental health related but this has been affecting my life mentally and it's starting to annoy me to the point I can't even explain.,"This is pretty hard to explain and I don't know if there is a term for this but my OCD makes me keep on checking things. Like I'll keep looking at the water tap again, again, again and again. Like it's so annoying. I always think my brain is playing tricks on me and it's so annoying and it's been affecting my life. For another example I'll always keep checking my Instagram in fear that I've accidentally somehow posted something. If you could help reduce the amount of times I keep checking that will be amazing thank you."
425,I think my mental health is declining,"I'm 15 and I have,autism,ADHD and odd. My depression is at an old-time high my stress anxiety are all I constantly worried about I have very very bad anger issues sometimes.I do have thoughts of suicide and I don't know what to do I don't trust anyone including my parents the only person that I trust is my dog and my dog is the only one keeping me from ending it all I'm starting to withdraw myself I'm starting to eat less and less I'm starting to get more paranoid and I feel like I'm walking around on eggshells. I don't know what to do I constantly hate myself and I constantly think of myself as a failure I constantly think my parents hate me and constantly think everyone hates me constantly think everyone's laughing behind my back everyone's judging me I don't know what to do and I'm scared to constantly I'm scared of how all of this might and I don't know what to do. I live in the US."
426,I don't have any reason not to kms and I'm thinking about it,"26, college drop out, no friends, my dad and I don't get along, no gf, short, ugly, getting older and lamer, no money, never was a fly guy, never will be a guy who gets fucking pussy as far as I can tell, get called a fag, no clout, no social status, had one friend recently and she thought I was shit and doesn't want to talk to me anymore, I just hate everyone and everything including myself and my fucking stupid life and I want it all to go away"
427,Trauma from two specific experiences,"So during the last few years I had two experiences that I heavily regret. I haven’t had any problems thinking about them until now. For the last two weeks I’ve been beating myself up with these thoughts that don’t let me function throughout the day and make me constantly worry.

First experience happened when I was 15, and I anonymously shared nudes here on Reddit even though I was underage. I got complimented by some people and like a day later I decided to delete it.

Second experience happened at 16; I went on Omegle (also completely anonymously) and tried to look for people of my age because I was curious. I was so desperate that eventually decided to expose myself to a 21 year old. I lied and said I was 17 and them I decided to show myself. After he complimented me I felt disgusted so I instantly logged off. 

I never thought about it again until recently, and it’s been severely affecting my self-esteem and mental health.

I haven’t shared this with anyone except my therapist and I would like to get some words of support from others."
428,In need of online options to avoid a possible crisis,"I was let go very suddenly from my job four days ago. I'd already been struggling with anxiety and depression and, in the rare moments things sink in, I know I need some help asap to get me through this month. Available therapists are hard to find without a long wait and I don't have the energy to put in the work on top of trying to sort out unemployment, find a new job and process everything.

There are so many online therapy apps out there, are any of them good? I can't afford to waste any money if they end up being crap."
429,I don't want to feel alone anymore,"Hey there, I'm Schwartacus, 26 years old, male, german.  
And for about 10 years I gradually feel more and more alone.  


I was born a late child to my mother who was 39 at that time and my father who was about 13 years younger than her. They weren't married but afaik we lived a really good life until my father died in an car accident exactly one month before my 2nd birthday.  


Due to that fact my mother had to work hard to earn the money she needed to allow me to grow up a happy child. She always got me what I wanted eventually, even if it took time to save some money up for it. I'm extremely lucky to have a mother like her. On the other end her life is what one would describe as a misery. I don't want to go further into it. Let's say I don't want to talk with her about myself because she would break if I tell her how I think about myself and about my life situation.  


I always was a chubby and I still am. For that reason and because I always smelled like cigarettes (my mother is a heavy smoker) I got heavily bullied in school when I was 13. I had friends in class but some people really hated me for whatever reason. And as the bullying went on, with teachers ignoring it even if I tried to talk to them, the feeling of being an outcast grew and grew.   


I needed to do 8th class again because my grades where really bad due to the bullying.   
I felt anxious coming into a new class but people started to like me and I even was the class represantative in the second year of being in that class.   
I felt happy and really had the feeling of having good friends.  


The core of my friends was a circle of four people, me included. A couple and another guy + me. We got things going almost every weekend. We loved and appreciated each other. But after the girl in the couple broke up 6 years ago because she didn't feel the fiery love anymore everything went downhill very fast. Her family blamed her for breaking up. She started to cut herself and I focussed on helping her out of it. I was furious everybody blames her for her feelings. I know she was thankful for it and she still is today. She is happily married today with a man she got to know a few months later. I was an outcast once again. She is not to blame for it, I just couldn't take it because she was a very special person whom I could have told everything that bothers me. I didn't love her, she was like a sister to me.  


In general, I was never lucky with women. I never had a girlfriend. I was told that she ""didn't want to lose me as a friend"" or ""I don't deserve such a kind and caring guy like you, you could have better"". Yeah, I know exactly what that means. Needless to say I didn't hear anything from one of them for years now. That's why I'm probably not able to talk to women anymore. Fear of rejection. And knowing what women have to endure on social media and stuff doesn't make it any better. All those idiots who treat women like objects are the worst of our kind. Just to make my point here clear.  


My family always was kind of scattered. My grandmother (mother of my late father) has three grandchildren of which I was the first. As soon as the next was born I got less and less attention and after the third was born I basically wasn't there anymore. As I turned 18 I didn't even get some chocolate from her on christmas. That really, really hurt me. We see each other maybe twice a year, other member maybe 3 or 4 times. So they are more stranger than family to me.  


After I lost my main circle of friends I got more into another group. People of my year in school and we mainly played games on the internet after school. But I never felt at home while being with them tbh. With time I started to dislike our main game, league of legends, and I tried to get them to play other things with me. ""Maybe later"" or ""Doesn't look that interesting"" were their answers.  
Multiple times I showed them that I was sad about this situation, that it pushed me to being extremely negative to myself. ""Understandable"" was one of the answers. The others weren't any better...   


Before Christmas 2020 I left the discord server and cut the ropes basically. I forgot how it feels to be love, don't feel worthy to be loved, I'm an outcast, I'm just...there. There seems nothing special about me. Someone one does not really care about...  


Don't worry, I got work, mastered an apprenticeship as the best apprentice in my region in 2019. I feel like I can do more. I want to write a book. You won't believe it because I'm writing this in english but I got a talent to write texts and stories in german. Some teachers said it in school and both of my team leaders at work say it. So I'm pretty happy about a talent I got. But I'm afraid of failing. I always get angry at myself when I fail. Be it in a video game or at work. I play a bit of darts and one evening I was throwing horribly that I punched the wall. Very hard. Went to hospital to get it x-ray'd and the doctor said a bit harder and I had fractured my hand. I'm not an angry person. I'm just angry at myself. And it grows bigger and bigger.   


I'm afraid of being consumed by hate towards myself. I think I can do more. But I feel alone. No one can survive this world alone. Sooner or later they'll break.  


Thank you for reading this. I appreciate any comment here. And excuse any error in the text."
430,I run a mental health podcast and I’m looking for guests,"I have a podcast called Am I Mental? We broadcast live every Thursday at 6:00PM Pacific Time/9:00PM Eastern Time. The first episode of each of the first two seasons I share parts of my own story and the cohosts also share with their own episodes. Each episode we explore different mental health conditions and how they impact life. We also look at things like highly stressful situations and how they can take a toll on mental health. We’ve had guests come on and share about Antisocial Personality Disorder, Bipolar 2, people who escaped from Christian cults, a mother who’s own brother raped her daughter before the daughter turned 7, a father who has a kid with brain cancer, a man who was raped repeatedly by his biological father from 7-13 years old and how that impacts him today, and much more. No story is too big or too small to be shared.

The goals of the podcast are two fold:

1) Help remove the stigma from mental health

2) Help others with mental health issues to understand you are not alone

We have a live chatroom during each episode and we share comments and questions with the guest so they can respond.

If you want to check us out we have a website at [https://amimental.net](https://amimental.net) and our episodes can be found at [https://www.spreaker.con/show/mentallivecast](https://www.spreaker.con/show/mentallivecast).

431,Help!!,My little sister said she was depressed a few months ago but I was confused bc she said she was only depressed about her body the thing is her body is Average and pretty fit she is not overweight or underweight. I asked her if she got bullied she said no then I asked if anything happened to her and she said no I don’t get it bc she gets comments on her body and told lots of positive things people even thought she was in sports.she is a very positive person most of the time she is super energetic and she’s always doing things her mood is never sad or angry.she also said she self harmed before but she doesn’t any more. A couple of months later she and I where talking about insecurities and I was confused bc she didn’t mention her body and she said she was insecure about other things which was only 2 things she said those where the only things .she worked out maybe for a week but then she stopped and said she wasn’t really focused on working out.I didn’t think it was body dysmorphia bc she is not talking about it all the time or looking in the mirror and she never tried to hide her body before either (she always wears skinny jeans or tights)but idk. is it possible that it’s not depressions?
432,STUPID advice!,"It's awful!!

All that super dumb advice. I can't fucking hear it anymore. Those fucking idiots! I'm so fucking tired of it!

I'm mentally ill for 11 years now and it just doesn't get better. No pill helps. No therapy helps. No psychedelics help. Nothing helps.

I'm STILL looking for a way to heal from this disease instead of killing myself. I deserve a crown for that! I honestly fucking do!

And then YOU people (like, not actually this sub, lol! But friends, family and people on social media and stuff) tell me to go for a walk, get help, try therapy and that it will get better and sunshine after the storm and sun after the rain and light in the dark.

GIRL NO!!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. APPARENTLY NOT! IT ALL DOESN'T HELP AND DOESN'T HAPPEN! YOU ARE DELUSIONAL!"
433,So what's the bottom line on psychiatry?,"So, i'm essentially trying to piece meal whether or not I should give psychotropics a shot and I have a lot of fundamental questions that I'm struggling to readily find convincing answers to. My questions revolve around the validity, science, efficacy, benefits, and dangers of psychiatry and psychotropics.
I've read several pieces on the ""Mad in America"" website, watched several clips of the anti psychiatry ""Medicating Normal"" documentary, read some of Dr. Awais Aftab's interesting blog posts, and have looked at a lot of other things as well and they make seemingly compelling arguments backed by research that ultimately paint a pretty scary picture of psychiatry. On the other side of the fence though you will see plenty of people lambasting the ""anti-psychiatry"" crowd and advocating for the arguable benefits of psychotropics.
At the end of the day I'm left confused and frustrated because the whole debate about psychotropics seems like a deep and murky rabbit hole where each side is alleging holes leaking behind the research, evidence, and logic presented by the other side. My brain fog and mental condition overall make it difficult for me to be able to spend weeks trying to find some semblance of ""truth.""
Ultimately what scares me the most are the withdrawal tales of arguably brilliant men like David Foster Wallace or Jordan Peterson who apparently got their brains wrecked and were either driven to death or close to it by their psychotropic experiences. If these guys suffered then what hope does your average uninformed Joe with terrible insurance and access to terrible bottom of the barrel pill dispensing ""psychiatrists"" have?
I don't want to be left with permanent damage or tardive dyskinesia, dysphoria, or akathisia for example, which is apparently hell on earth. I feel mentally incapacitated by what I would describe as brain fog and ADHD, I feel like I can barely think, focus, or do much of anything, but I'm left terrified by psychiatry as an option. Can anyone offer interesting insight regarding the validity of psychiatry and whether I should give it a shot?
Thanks."
434,Ive been babied and infantilized my entire life and i feel like im going insane,"My parents have spoiled, sheltered, and babied me my whole damn life and now i dont know how to take care of myself and go off on my own. And apparently my parents, particularly my mom, did that cause they want to treat me like a fucking baby my entire life and make me stay with them for the rest of my life. My mom is such an overbearing, power tripping bitch who constantly follows me around, invades my privacy, gets in my face, analyzes every social interaction i have, and pushes me around. I think she does that cause she literally sees me as a five year old. She doesnt trust that i can do anything on my own so she thinks she has to live for me. I cant even go into the fucking kitchen without her following me there and watching what im doing, and then she steps in and does shit for me when i try to start cooking on my own, so i basically have no idea how to cook a complex meal on my own. And she does this for literally everything else in the house. Just takes over and never lets me learn how to do it on my own

And i cant say anything back cause my parents are sensitive and have gigantic, fragile egos. If you dare question their authority at all theyll get all upset and defensive and start guilt tripping you for everything. And im 100% financially reliant on them so i have to suck up to them if i want to be in their good graces financially. 

I just feel so humiliated, so inept, and so fucking stuck. I dont know how to move past this and become independent when my parents are so controlling and literally watch my every move. Im so tired of having to listen to their shitty beliefs as well, hearing them parrot all this blatant misinformation from propaganda sites. And they’re also against the lgbt community which i found out im a part of so i cant be myself as long as i live with them

College is my only hope to get out of here but even then my parents dont want me to go to a different state or even city, they want me to stay home while im in college. And fuck me i already told colleges in the apps I submitted that i have a preference to be off-campus so there goes my chance at living on my own. 

I fucking hate myself. Over the past hour ive just been having thoughts of slitting my throat or choking myself to death just so i can escape this. I feel so stuck and hopeless. I dont know what to do"
435,I dreamed about commuting suicide last night,I survived tho
436,Quite literally losing my mind!,"Got a DUI, girlfriend left and I got a concussion at work. Life is really kicking me in the balls right now and my mental health has slipped. I am really fighting till Monday not to go to the hospital. 

I am at the point where everything feels empty and void of meaning. There is a hole in my heart and a pit in my stomach right now that won’t go away and all I do it pace around the house for hours."
437,What do you think about CBD for mental health??,Have you ever used it before?
438,What’s wrong with me?,"Hello! I’ve never really talked about my mental health but I decided to ask for help because I genuinely don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I’m 17 F if that helps? But for the past year or so, I’ve just been feeling, i guess emotionally numb? I’m not so sure. It started off by being sad all the time and then eventually I just felt numb and empty. I guess apathetic is a good word to describe it.

Recently (since September or August) my emotions sort of spiraled. 

I’ve been feeling...restless?? I snap really quickly I guess. I go from feeling nothing to feeling very angry for no reason, and then sad and crying a few minutes later. I feel extremely bad, especially since I tend to snap at people because of this, but I genuinely can’t control it, and I’m not sure why. 

I don’t know what’s wrong and im so drained of being like this, I don’t find joy in the things I used to and my life is slipping away. I went from being an A+ student at the top of my class to failing and skipping, I just lay in bed all day and watch the day pass."
439,"After a certain trigger, I just stop thinking for 10-30 minutes and I don't know why","This might be hard to explain and I don't even know what the issue is but sometimes if it's too overly cluttered in the flat or every time the dishes are piled up too high.. I just stop and slowly shut down for a while. It doesn't usually happen when I'm alone, only when my partner is present.

Ater attempting to do a pile of dishes stacked up so high I can't reach over them, I go and lie down and just.. stop thinking. Straight up smooth brain, staring. For the first 10 minutes I do tend to respond, watch YT, but nothing past that. When I get prompted to do things, that minor amount of thinking.. stops.

It takes a few minutes for me to realise I've stopped thinking. After that realisation I can think, as normal, where I just think the random thought progressions in my head (I've been told they're odd before but that's for another day) but talking or actually moving are difficult/near impossible to do. This time I actively tried to think about the dishes, the problem I needed to fix, but that thought only stayed very very briefly. I am responding to my surroundings, mentally. When my partner asks me a question, I am responding mentally but just don't feel the will to say it out loud.

I don't think its Maldaptive Disorder or disassociaton - I know who I am, where I am and what I am doing for the most part. I am also somewhat thinking after a while, but the thoughts are hard to control and mostly completely random - the same as they are when I'm about to fall asleep. Full sentences, like a full conversation in my head.

Maybe I'm just lazy?? Or something. But it feels.. near impossible to hold onto my thoughts or move for a while. Any suggestions as to what could be happening would be great."
440,Needing some support after a rough period dealing with trauma flashbacks.,"I've been working through my childhood trauma with therapy for years but sometimes it gets so heavy.

442,Mental and Physical health tracking app,"I have ADHD, so I tend to forget a lot of things. I’ve been taking medication for almost 2 years now, and I’ve noticed how it has changed me mentally and physically. I was wondering if there’s an app out there that tracks mental and physical health and let’s you set reminders. It seems like most only track one thing like sleep, exercise, diet, or moods—I’m looking for an app that tracks all of those things and then some."
443,Why do i want an injury without the pain?,"For some reason, I really want to get injured in some way, especially some kind of scar. But it’s not like I want to feel pain, I’m scared of pain. I actually have started cutting a bit, but it’s never deep because I don’t want it to hurt that much. It just gives me this horrible, weird satisfaction to see myself bleeding and hurt. I’ve also been biting myself (mainly my hands and sometimes my arms) since I was pretty young, never enough to draw blood or anything, I don’t think my teeth are sharp enough, but always as hard as possible. I would try to leave marks that lasted a long time.
I hate this, and it’s making me hate myself even more. I don’t know if this is me wanting to be like the characters on tv that I think are cool, since most of them get into fights a lot and are often injured in some way. I don’t know what it is, but I think I need some help because it’s making me want to get into fights and/or just hurt myself, like I’m already doing"
444,Looking for some mental health advice during the lockdown,"Hi all,

I'm currently in lockdown (as many of us are right now), which means I'm confined to pretty much a single room for most of the day. I generally do pretty well on my own, but I was looking for any tips you guys have for keeping mentally healthy during such a time? Maintaining exercise (going for runs when possible, etc.) are of course a must, but asides from this, what can I do to combat the fatigue which comes from being stuck inside and on a computer screen (for work) all day?

Thanks for any replies!"
445,Does therapy ever help anyone honestly?,"I don’t know if it was therapy itself or my psychologist that was crap, because it didn’t help me to the slightest.

It was provided by a Public Health Service in Europe, but that doesn’t mean it should be this bad."

447,Feelinng numb and suicidal,"It is me again...

At this point I honestly just want to die. I feel numb yet scared yet sad and i dont know...

I am scared for monday, the only thing that happens on monday is school will continue. Not even an exam pr anything. And I would rather die than go to school, I am not even being bullied or anything. I am just in an endless fear from school. 

My genderdysphoria also doesnt do me a favor, i can't watch anything without thinking ""I wish i was just a normal girl"" etc..(I am not publicly outed yet only to close family) 

I am feeling numb and yet like I am torn apart from the inside.

I want this numbness to go away. I dont even have anything to look foward for I have not really friends... Online none at all, In reallife they know me as a male and its hurting me not beeing able to tell them because it would ruin my whole school year and I might stop then...

I just want this all to stop... I feel like a pathetic stupid person...

448,What can I expect from therapy?,"Like, what is the process? How exactly does it work?

I'm thinking of starting therapy since I have insurance now. I went once when I was in my teens, over ten years ago, but I honestly don't remember and I think I only had one session. My mom pulled me out when they started mentioning medication. Over the years, I've gotten way worse to the point of not really functioning. so I think I'm going to go back. What can I expect?"

I have very weak joints, sometimes it’s hard to even walk.
I struggle with both depression and BPD and no one listens to me when I say it’s getting worse.
I grew up with a physically and mentally abusive mom so at a young age I was forced to grow up- therefore I lost my childhood hence my maturity.
Because I’ve been so grown up my whole life everyone expects me to solve all of my own problems and never seek help. I’ve had many failed suicide attempts and still no one listens to me
I’m so tired of being so alone and treated like an adult when I’m not even in high school yet
I’m so tired of having to be something I’m not, I’m so tired of helping everyone else and still being expected to help myself
What should I do? I’m so scared I’m gonna disappoint everyone and I’m just stuck.
I genuinely hate myself and jt seems like everyone else does too

450,What would a psychiatrist be able to do for me?,"I'm depressed because nothing interests or impresses me.  I'm burning out at work because I have no incentive to work hard because I don't care about anything.  So what will a therapist be able to do?  I've tried to force myself to 'like' things for years how is a doctor going to change things?  Heck - even getting drunk doesn't make me happy.  

If they prescribe antidepressants will they make me happy and giddy and motivate me?  And if they don't make me giddy and happy then WHAT'S THE POINT?  Do I just continue to suffer BECAUSE YOU SAY I SHOULD?"

452,where to start with therapy?,"im 19 and have struggled with my mental health since like 11 years old or something. i have a lot of issues regarding my family, identity, trauma, forced religion, depresson, anxiety, s/h, possible adhd along with other things. i used to beg and plead to my family to let me go to therapy 6ish years ago but instead of helping me get therapy or treatment i was gaslit, ridiculed, and guilt-tripped for possibly suggesting someone besides them could help. fast forward to now they are suddenly concerned and angry that i don't take my life seriously. im going to be honest, i just don't care about my life, i know its selfish of me but i don't remember the last time i woke up without wishing i was dead. i fluctuate between a 6 to an 8 on the emmengard scale. part of me is scared that if i get treatment i will lose my personality. i dont know who i am without everything ive been through, if i heal from that what will be left of me? im terrified of who that person is. my dad died in dec 2016 and my aunt in march 2017, i dont think ive fully processed the grief of that, i was kind of left to deal with it on my own because my brother spiraled and they focused on that along with helping my mom cope. ive gotten good at hiding my emotions no one knows whats going on with me because besides some dark jokes i dont tell anyone anything. every few months ill have a major breakdown where i cry everything out and s/h just to feel something then i go back to the numbness. recently its been too much for me to deal with, like i said my family is concerned now (a few years late lmao) my sister yells at me constantly because i dont eat and it scares and worries my mom (i dont have a distinct ED, but my eating habits arent healthy and i know that). i want help because with work and school i realized i cannot function anymore and its exhausting but it just seems so hard to find. 

how do people find a therapist? where do i look? is it mainly just looking at psych today profiles? what does the process look like (what first steps to take)? any methods shared will be helpful. thank you for reading"
453,"Questions about thoughts of death, and sixth sense.","Sorry in advance if this is too long but to try to make Long story short, I’m 30 years old I don’t have any known mental illnesses or anything like that, I think I live a pretty ok life at the moment, despite all the crazy shit going on in the world. I did suffer from mild depression in the past, and had a history of mild drug abuse, but nothing extremely significant or anything. I’ve been sober for over 3 years now thanks to my wife giving birth to my first born and I would say my mental health at the moment is so much better than 4 years ago when I had mild depression. 

The question I would like to ask is that is it normal to think about, or imagine myself dying time to time? Especially while I’m driving, For example, I somewhat often randomly think while I’m driving that I would get into a car accident, like I would hit a deer or something of that nature. Maybe it’s just paranoia but I just can’t understand why I would randomly think something horrible is going to happen while I’m driving. I really worry more about other people on the road doing something stupid than myself, because i am a pretty safe and good driver. 

Like today for example, I was on the highway driving home and I kept getting random thoughts of some object hitting me while I’m on the road. Or me getting into a horrible accident, Shortly after some sort of big ply wood or big piece of card board box of some sort, flew from the opposite side of the highway and hit my car got sucked under and tore up the bottom   Right front side of my carcausing anti freeze to leak from the bottom hose. The timing of this object couldn’t be any more exact it gave me maybe 2 seconds to react, so I ended up getting hit by it. It was Almost as if I foresaw this event, like some final destination shit. then just 3 days prior I was driving at night and kept thinking I was gona hit a deer, and get into a bad accident. Maybe an hour later there’s a big ass dead deer in the middle of the road that I didn’t see until last second, towards the left lane and I drove over it on the same exact side that the card board tore up today. 

Aside from that I also randomly time to time think about just death in general, or what if I was to die kind of thing. it’s not borderline or anything like that, and by no means do I want to die because I have many reasons to live for, and I wish I don’t get these thoughts at all. 
Is this normal? Has this happened to anyone else?"
454,How do I talk about my mental health with my family?,"   How do I tell my family that I'm thinking of killing myself? I have problems with hiding my emotions and then crying and cutting myself.

Overall I got it good;  well off financially, smart, decent social circle, good fam, hell I'm not even that ugly.  But for years I have had a crush on one of my friends, well found out she's been crushing on me for years too. Dope right? I thought so at least.  Well within like 2 weeks I fucked it up.  Basically lost my head while fucked up and decided it was over cause I thought she was trying to fuck with my emotions.  Regretted it the next day but it was done.  This was months ago, we're still friends.  Honestly looking at it she might be toxic, but if she is it's not intentionally (just misunderstood lmao).  But I can't get over her and it's killing me.  Just can't stop thinking of her and regretting the past. Passed up on dating another great girl cause ik it wouldn't be fair to her.  Worse part is this girl isn't anything special, no real hobbies, not the smartest, no goals, high maintenance, attractive but not like a model. Was perfect for me tho.

Too the guy who called me Mushroom Head in second grade because I had a bowl cut.
 
   I hope your doing well.

Too the kids who wouldn’t be my friend because I didn’t want to kill insects and I said I wanted to join the circus.
    
     May you get everything you every dreamed.

  Too the guy in high school who thought because I was emo it was “okay” to tell me to kill myself:
 
  I hope you’ve never dealt with mental health issues.
 
  Too the girl who threw water bottles at me at the concerts we frequented because we liked the same guy.
   I hope your with someone who treats you right.

460,I hurt,"Our 21 year old daughter left to go back to Rochester, NY to finish her last semester of college. I won't see her again until May, when she graduates. It hurts so much. She roomed with her sister and now that space looks so empty. I can't even go into that room. She took her cockatiel back with her, and I miss the constant chirping, even though my 'tiel is just as noisy now. I just hurt all over. It was so nice to have her home...now she is gone, 4 hours away. She DID video chat me when she got home, which was comforting knowing she is OK and back in her apartment. :( Why does this hurt so much? This isn't the first time she has come home and then gone back to school. It hurts so much worse this time.

463,Scatterbrained,"I’m at a loss these days. I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and insomnia when I was 9 years old after spending some time in a mental hospital. For a while I was on meds, but haven’t been since I was maybe 13-15. I’m 21(f) now, and was diagnosed with anxiety again at 19. Still no medication, no therapy either. Never really found much solace in it.

 I have a family history of anxiety, depression, insomnia, BPD, ADHD,and I’m sure more. Both my siblings are diagnosed with PTSD, and so was the parent that caused the PTSD in them. Vicious cycle of toxic &amp; narcissistic parenting, we’ll leave it at that.

Lately it’s like my mind is going at a mile a minute. A bunch of random thoughts, one right after another. Words, phrases, ideas, memories, worries, etc. Basically everything all at once. /as shown in my little tangent above...

I’m not sure how to go about managing this, or if it’s even an anxiety thing. I’ve considered journaling, but find it difficult to sort through the scatter &amp; settle on one thing. I’m never thinking about just one thing at a time. I find it difficult to focus and stay on task, and sometimes can’t even get myself to START a task. I sometimes zone out entirely while trying to do so.
I’ve also been pretty easily irritable when people try interacting with me when this is going on.

Fracture ur foot anti depressant. Have surgery...anti depressant. Jus recently got diagnosed with RA its excruciating whatd i get an anti depressant. I have daily migraines whatd I get an anti depressant.. which i have seen zero improvement n the past 6 months i been on it.I believe there's a place for them such as people with mental health issues. Maybe it'll help some ppl.

I had a not-so-good experience with one ages ago, but I know I really need to go again. But just like I am with any appointment, I’ve putting it off for a really long time. I think I could text a therapist much easier than getting a referral and showing up physically to appointments. Especially because I have the same doctor that referred me to the “bad” therapist and she got aggravated when I expressed I didn’t like that therapist. It was really awkward. I told her I could hold off on another and she said “So you just want to be like this forever?” I have a lot of pressure from my family too which I know Im lucky I have family that believes in it, but it kind of annoys me when they act like it would be a one and done and Ill be cured. Anyway, I get ads for Better Health and Im wondering if its just as good as in person. I got really nervous and awkward at my last therapist and I felt like I couldnt express my feelings as well."
469,"""Validation"" is one of the most hurtful ways to invalidate someone","In my experience, 95% of the time when people are trying to be validating, it's because they're not actually taking you seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I heard years and years as a kid of stuff like, oh, it's normal to be upset and frustrated with your parents.  No, I was being physically and sexually abused at home and your ""validation"" just told me that you don't care.  Adults were so busy delivering the validation that they never bothered to listen long enough to get the full story.  This pretty frequently included mental health professionals.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to therapy for years.  I got years of validation of how it's normal for therapy to feel frustrating and to feel like you can't concentrate.  And it's normal for people to struggle with distorted thinking that makes them think they can't just push through.  Turns out I actually have ADHD which wasn't diagnosed through many years of treatment.  All the validation was was a smokescreen for not considering that I might actually have the problems I reported having.  And all the validation actually did was make me feel even more horrible when I'd push and push and push and not get anywhere, because I was being reassured that it was all normal and natural for someone with anxiety to have the issues I was and I just needed to keep trying.

&amp;#x200B;

What I learned was that validation was a very good way to tell someone to shut the fuck up while making it so that they're the bad guy for pushing back.  Because you're being nice and helpful, see?  It's like you're substituting saying nice things and providing the verbal equivalent of a pat on the back, for actually hearing someone out and seriously engaging with what they're saying.  Even if it sounds wrong to you or doesn't make sense.  Even if they're a child or a mental health patient or someone else who you've been taught doesn't have the correct perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

It's far more helpful and far more respectful, and ultimately far more *genuinely* validating, to seriously talk to someone and even point out where you think they're wrong, than to just give these sorts of supposedly validating responses.  Because when you're giving them, you're communicating that you know what's going on, when you might not.  And you're doing it in a way that doesn't really leave the other person any room to push back if you're wrong, because you've already identified their feelings as the focal point.  Since you're not being aggressive or actually challenging what they say, there's no good way to push back and it's often very confusing for the other person why they feel so horrible after you were so nice to them.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish all our mental health talk and being nice would spend more time being direct and actually figuring out what's going on, and less just trying to make people feel better.  Because it inevitably ends up that you're trying to make them feel better based on your assumptions about the world and what's going on."
470,I'm in a dark place,"Well I'm new to this sub to use in order to perhaps vent and help with my current mental state. Lately I've been needing a therapist although financial issues are keeping me from doing such, so perhaps venting a bit here will help at least a bit with my current mood. Now I've suffered from depression for a long time now although recently it has been hitting me extremely hard. And well I believe it is trauma from my past. I've grown up with an alcoholic father, I've been in multiple abusive relationships, and I've been in an extremely dysfunctional family. And while my depression started due to these reasons I never had an emotional outlet and it has gotten to this point. I just don't know what to do currently. I've just been feeling so lost and overwhelmed with everything going on. I've been trying to manage it on my own since I don't like being a burden to others and make them sad, although it's gotten to a point where I actually don't know how to handle it. Right now I'm just stuck in a dark place and I don't know where to turn. Recently I've felt like I've deserved what's happened in my life as well and that's been taking a huge toll on my mental state. I've been feeling extremely unmotivated and rather worthless and pathetic lately. It's all just too much to handle... I've just been needing to get some stuff off my chest and seek support. I'm sorry of it sounds extremely jumbled I'm just writing down my thoughts here. Anyways that's the end of my post for now, I'll see you guys around."
471,I took my first shower in a month,"Today I had my first shower in a month, after having a difficult depression episode. Please refrain from calling me mean names, I already feel like a disgusting person."
472,Does this sound like stress or a depressive episode? Or something else?,"I'm diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, major depression, autism and ADHD. Generally speaking the last few years my mental health has been a lot better, and I hand't thought that these periods would count as an episode of depression as it doesn't really have the emotional aspect that I usually experience - feeling down, worthless, sadness, sick of life, etc. But I'm struggling to put a name on it.

Sometimes, I just get so tired for like a month or more at a time. Where I don't want to do anything because I feel too tired and like its too difficult. I fall behind in my studies, I don't take shifts at work, I don't clean or cook except when my support worker visits, I don't shower very often, etc. But I can muster up energy and excitement for like a day or so before I run out of steam again. I just recently visited my dad for Christmas and you'd never know I was tired like this because I was super helpful with cooking, cleaning, etc for the first few days I was there. The last few days I wasn't but I think I got away with not being obvious. And the part that makes it seem most like depression is that I get REALLY sleepy. Not just tired during the day, but I end up actually sleeping for like 12, 13, 14 hours some nights.

I know its triggered by stress, because first I was worried about Christmas coming up, about making travel plans, buying gifts and taking enough shifts to have enough money. And then I was worried about how behind I had gotten in my studies - I'm about a month behind after some catch up - and then now I'm stressed because I have no money because I didn't take any shifts the week of Christmas so I have to wait until I get my disability pension on Tuesday to go grocery shopping but I'm out of food. But I know all these things could be improved if I actually did something about them, I should have taken shifts this week but I cancelled all of them, I could probably feel less tired if I went for a walk or did things during the day instead of obsessively playing Minecraft, and I could probably catch up on my studies instead of having to drop the class if I actually just sat down and studied a bit every day, but I haven't studied all week.

But again, I'm not feeling ""depressed"" like I have in the past. I'm feeling a bit worried about all the responsibilities I'm neglecting, and I'm feeling frustrated and annoyed at myself for doing nothing even though every day I keep telling myself I'll do better tomorrow, but I'm not feeling sad or anything else like that, and I'm not having very negative thoughts. And I've done a lot of therapy over many years, so I can tell I'm not currently ruminating on anything or having distorted thinking about anything.

I've tried bringing this up with my psychiatrist and with my psychologist, but I'm not sure they really understand what I'm trying to say and haven't offered any useful suggestions. I feel like I'm in this state about 50% of my time, so I'd really appreciate anyone weighing in or offering suggestions.

Thanks in advance!"

480,Does cutting make me crazy :(,Hello everyone I’m just feeling really down about myself because of the coping mechanisms I use. I know there are healthier options out there and I do see a therapist but it’s nothing compared to cutting and drugs. I would never judge or put down anyone else that self harms so I don’t know why I’m doing it to myself. My bf found cuts on me and called me disgusting and humiliated me. I guess I just need validation that I’m not crazy.
481,my experience with suicide.,"TW// Suicide

Suicide has always been something thats constantly lingered in my family and life. when i was 12-13 i believe (i’m 15 now) my mother had quit her job and ran off. we didn’t see her til the next afternoon, she stopped replying and she left me a message saying she was sorry. i’ve never felt more guilty in my life. that morning i was the last person she talked to and i could’ve maybe convinced her out of the actions she was going to do that day. she’s alive and well but she had attempted to take her life that day. the scars are a constant reminded that i fucked up. i’ve been suicidal since 5th grade. it started around the time when i got into a toxic relationship (which i know sounds INSANE in the 5th grade but she was very very sexual. and i was not) and a very toxic relationship fuelled from both sides. obviously i wasn’t going to take my life back then but in 7th grade was when i really started trying my hardest. around the time my mother tried to take her own life. im not a very happy person. i don’t like the position i am in, the household i’m in is not a very safe one for my mental health (no i’m not being physically abused) with my mummy issues and daddy issues. my mother is not the most supportive person ever but i try my hardest to show her that i love her, she’s homophobic (she will never admit it but she says the slurs all the time despite me saying that it makes me uncomfortable when she does and DESPITE me literally coming out to her), she’s racist (says those slurs as well. we are very very white) and i grew up thinking that was okay! which is complete bullshit!! i’ve done my research now and have properly educated myself and i correct her every time. i know she loves me deep down in her heart but i know for a fact that she loves alcohol more then her own child. i wanna be an actor when i grow up and a cinematographer and she’s not very supportive of that. about three weeks ago i was planning on killing myself, but a song came on “Two of Us” by Louis Tomlinson. i’m not sure why that song in particular stopped me but it did. i’m not doing amazingly but i’m getting help and i’m not in harms way. i want anyone who is reading this to KNOW you are not alone. 
Have a good one x"
482,am i in a toxic relationship,"Am i in a toxic relationship?

Am i in a toxic relationship?

Hey reddit, I am 15 and have a girlfriend that I am being told is a narcissist and also gaslights me and i’m kinda hurting a lot and also confused. To explain this my girlfriend and me have these times where she’s super good to me and let’s me know how much she loves me and then a few minutes later or hours later she starts try texting and acting like she’s mad. This confuses me a lot and sometimes I think i’m overthinking. She’ll go from long happy text that obviously have a kind and positive tone to “oh” “mm” “yea” “ok”. Also most nights me and my girlfriend end off with a “i love you goodnight” and sometimes when I say it she refuses to tell me she loves me back and makes me question if she even loves me or if i’m good enough. Sometimes also my girlfriend will go offline mid convo for 10-15 min. I’m not sure if i’m being clingy or if she’s like ignoring me but during these times I like go through the convo panicking thinking I did something wrong. Also about the narcissist traits my mother had said she has. She is constantly calling herself ugly or bad looking when she is like actually so pretty and I constantly like every convo we have (no even a over exaggeration) have had to compliment her. our whole relationship feels like i’m doing everything and i’m scared and I have no confidence to break free. Someone help me.

483,(22M) Why am I just now realizing how different I am?,"Why am I only now realizing how different I am? Everyone around me feels so alien... I don’t understand how they are able to form relationships with each other. I don’t get why people enjoy partying and being in loud clubs and bars. Why don’t I enjoy being around other people like everyone else? Why am I scared to talk to people but it seems nobody else is? Why couldn’t I handle school like everyone else? 
I feel like everyone else my age is so much further ahead mentally than I am.

What’s wrong with me? I feel like I’m failing at life and there’s nothing I can do."
484,Addicted to choking myself?,"Hi. I’m not a regular reddit user so please let me know if i’m posting this in the wrong place. I’m 19/f, and i’m diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety. Over the last couple of years, ever since i got into an abusive relationship which i’m now thankfully out of, i’ve developed what has turned into an addiction to choking myself. This addiction is in no way kink related. It’s mostly rooted in the slight euphoria that asphyxiation can cause. It started with just holding my breath, but eventually progressed to the point of me strangling myself several times a minute (when i’m alone at least). There are several instances where i’ve choked myself to the point of falling on the floor and shaking violently. Sometimes the urge becomes more intense when i’m under a lot of stress. I did some research to try and find people who struggle with this same problem, but all i can find is kink related stuff. Anyways, I just want to know if anyone else struggles with this same problem and if there’s anything i can do to decrease my urge to choke myself. From what little information I could find about self-asphyxiation, it seems very dangerous and I don’t want to be jeopardizing my health in this way. Thanks for reading :)"
485,You deserve to love yourself.,"I cried hard today. Hardest I've cried since I had to movong in with my parents at the beginning of quarantine. Now I have my own apartment looking over the city. A job that has continued to support me. I worked hard to get the disability I needed to take the time to learn to love myself rather than finding it from outside. I accomplished what I set out to do, but I didn't bring anyone (that I know of) along with me. It does get lonely, and I know I have love to give to others still. 
Ten years ago I was writing weekly suicide notes. Going on long drives in hopes that I would crash. Meds never seemed quite right. Now my meds are stable, and I am graduating from weekly DBT therapy sessions to monthly. 
But getting what I wanted, of course, wasn't what I expected. And now I am living in the present, this continued lockdown where people have lost the means to support themselves, and I know that struggle was preparing me to help others. I still experience pain, emotional and physical. My emotions still run high, but my age has confirmed ots a superpower, even if I dont know how its suppose to help anyone but me, yet. 
You are worth saving. There is still more life that is not defined by pain. So many more people who might one day share love you will feel you deserve."
486,My quality of life in diminishing as I remain undiagnosed,"I’m not sure where to go to talk about this. I’ve never been to a doctor, a therapist, or a psychiatrist and I have no insurance to do so. I just want to see if anyone can help me figure out what is wrong with me and if anyone can relate to this. I’ll try my best to put it in words. I know for sure I have depressive symptoms but it feels like my brain is rotting. 
All my life I’ve had troubles focusing and feeling grounded to my surroundings. I was lousy in school, and couldn’t dedicate myself to anything I wasn’t passionate about. As I get older, its deteriorated further. I have absolutely no energy, even for my passions. My room is a mess of garbage, clothes, moldy food, etc. it feels like I’ve been transported here because I have no memory of this mess building up. My memory is fading and I can’t focus on anything. I’m easily overwhelmed and can’t finish any projects I start. I’m drowning in art commissions but I’m too fatigued to take care of them. My brain is absolute fog. I have audio processing issues and I’ve always been the family joke for being “dumb”. I’m not dumb at all, I just can’t process words very well and I constantly spacing out. I feel like I’ve been conscious for only 20% of my life. I remember almost no conversations I have. I feel like I’m on autopilot and I very very very rarely snap out of it. And when I do, I have no energy to take initiative. I have the motivation to work on my projects but I just can’t do it. I just want to sleep. Nobody takes me seriously when I say my memory is absolutely terrible. I barely even remember the good times I have with my friends. It feels like I’m being robbed of my life. I can’t take care of any of my adult responsibilities because I can’t focus enough to understand them. Filing my taxes, dealing with my credit, preparing for college, etc. It’s all mind numbing to me. I have no chance of survival on my own. I don’t know if this is a mix of depression and ADD or if it’s some kind of dissociative thing but it’s destroying me. I just want nothing more than to lift this haze in my brain and actually experience the world and have energy and work on the things I’m passionate about. I have the inspiration and motivation to get going on them but it feels like I’m locked in a cage and can’t reach it. Seeing people be able to make things that have more than two steps to them is baffling to me. I don’t remember to eat and I don’t remember if I HAVE eaten, so I’m pretty sure I just end up eating again. I don’t remember to go to the bathroom at all for up to 10 hours at a time. I’m completely disconnected from my body. I’ve been feeling woozy like I’m going to pass out and I’m gaining weight which is really odd for me. But I have no idea why because I have no memory of how I’ve been taking care of myself. I’m on the verge of quitting my job but I know that breaking my routine will be the death of me and I’ll just rot in bed. Does anyone know what I can do to help myself? What could possibly be wrong with me?"
487,What’s wrong with me?,"I don’t know if it’s ADD, depression, anxiety, or a combination of all 3 but my mental health has been bad for a little over a year (again). I got on an SSRI recently and although it’s kinda helped with my anxiety, my depression almost seems to be worse (don’t worry, I’m going to speak to my doctor about this). What really concerns me and bums me out is the fact that I can’t accomplish anything. I over-think everything so much that I end up doing nothing. I wake up instantly feeling overwhelmed/overstimulated and usually go straight on my phone. Constantly searching things as I’m constantly thinking, never being able to finish reading certain articles and posts as I’ve started thinking about something else, constantly having so many tabs open. Is this normal? A lot of times I feel so overwhelmed I end up just sitting on the couch and watch Netflix. How do I become more productive? I like the idea of doing more and I used to do more! Used to always go out with friends/by myself to restaurants, concerts, on hikes/camping trips  but it’s been so hard lately. I stopped drinking about two years ago and noticed I’m so much more introverted sober. Or maybe I’ve realized I’m more depressed? Anyway, I always tell myself at night that tomorrow will be different; I even make a to-list in my notes app but it never gets started.. or at least finished.I’m I that weak minded? Or lazy? Does anyone else feel this way or is there something seriously wrong with me? I’m so embarrassed that I’ve become this way. For those who are more self disciplined and have more of a structured schedule, how do you do it? What advice do you have for me?"
488,Am I too ungrateful and lazy to be depressed?,"Over the past year, my life has been an emotional rollercoaster as it has had its ups and downs. COVID had only made things worse. I’m 23 and still live with my parents and younger brother, I still haven’t finished my AA, I still haven’t gotten my license because my mom is too scared to teach me, my mother does all my laundry, clothes, and food for me but I want to learn. I’ve tried but it’s either my mom insists on her doing it or she’ll correct me by saying that I’m doing it wrong because she does it in an exact order. 

My father suffered a stroke when I was 7, and his mental health has deteriorated since then, I’ve helped my mom as much as I can but I feel powerless, my younger brother does a better job at being helpful but I’m the one that pays most of the bills in the house since my mother has to take care of my father the whole time and my brother also assisting. Having to juggle school, work, and my life at home has been very taxing. I feel very bad about my mother, since we can’t afford to put my father in a nursing home in order to make our lives easier.

My job has been treating me fairly but often I don’t feel the energy to be able to talk with my peers, I had to take a break from school since every class became an online course, and my relationship with my mom has deteriorated because of the ongoing issues my dad is having, and she tries to control my life as she sees fit. She hates the idea of me smoking weed, even though I only partake once a week to alleviate stress and anxiety, she keeps insisting on getting us a house, even though I want to live on my own first and will guilt trip me into staying, even though I can still provide financial assistance.

I want to move out but I’m afraid of abandoning my family in the process, despite the fact I promised myself I’d constantly visit. What would be best in my situation? I just want to improve myself and not let myself turn 40 and not know how to do their own laundry or cook."
489,I'm getting over Erotomania...and it's partly the person's fault I had it. I don't think the celebrity who I was obsessed with is doing too well with her mental disorder either. I'm really worried about her...I'm pretty sure she's having delusions of her own. Is Halsey ok?,"Hey guys, so I feel like I should open up about this just to get it out there. So several months ago I was going through a rough time, and I started feeling like something in my brain wasn't doing too well. I thought maybe I might be getting Schizophrenia. I felt...something in my brain, i guess, and it scared me. I wasn't quite sure what was going on. That was when I realized that my favorite pop star, whose music I had turned to for comfort, often references someone whose identity is left ambiguous. This isn't uncommon in music...but this time it's really weird. Has anyone listened to Manic? The thing is that there are a lot of questionable lines in this album. 

So before I get into the actual evidence, I should say I actually knew who Halsey was before she was famous. I watched a Youtube video of her parodying a song almost a decade ago, and 4 years later I became a fan without ever making the connection. Another thing that I'd like to mention is that around this time I started learning about an obscure but important part of human physiology called the endocannabinoid system, and I thought that it could really help people if someone actually told both the general public and the medical community(not taught in med school yet.) The last thing I'd like to mention is that her religion is synchronicity, or the philosophy of meaningful coincidence. So the first song in Manic is called Ashley(her real name) and essentially in the lyrics she addresses someone and says that if she dies from her chronic illnesses she hopes that they'll ""remember the days when we came to this place."" In the song ""I Hate Everybody"" she says ""I feel something like a scaly thing wrapped too tightly round my own master. My friends are getting bored of me, saying I fell in love with a stranger."" Another quote from this song is ""infatuation is observation with a cause."" Another example is in ""Dominic's Interlude,"" most of which isn't actually her but another artist. One of the lyrics in this song is literally ""if you're looking for signs then you should know, there's power in the words you're thinking.""

In 3AM she says ""I keep on hanging on the line, ignoring every warning line, c'mon and make me feel alright again."" In Alanis' Interlude she addresses someone, and says ""I think I'll probably die before I have you."" There are theories that this is about someone she had a fling with a long time ago, but considering the deep nature of the album it just seems unlikely. In ""Wipe Your Tears"" she talks about comforting someone and telling them all the time that she'll hold them. This song also contains the lyrics ""my bed is too big for only me, I keep a pistol when I sleep, inside my mouth, so I can shoot down all the bad things."" The thing is that she also references a bed too big for her in a much older song, and in another earlier song she talks about a ""weapon in her mind."" In ""Still Learning"" she says ""to the one I love, bring me round, get me out, right now."" Another lyric from this one is ""in the crowd you're readin my lips."" Finally, in the song ""Be Kind"" she says ""I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair, going sick in the head tryna get you there."" 

So the thing is that none of her other fans noticed this, partly because both he/she pronouns are used. The unfortunate thing about all this is that I did find a type of theoretical type of science that could explain all of this...if I'm gonna have delusions they're gonna have to be the most convoluted, ambiguous delusions in history, ya know? This type of science is called a Tesseract, and you may have heard of it if you've watched the Marvel movies or read ""A Wrinkle in Time."" Essentially this equation is a cube within a cube, and it would defy the normal laws of Physics. I'm going to include the video that gave me this idea. Around the time I watched the video years ago I started waking up feeling like I was doing a math problem, basically with my head throbbing. I theorized that because human DNA is essentially the most complicated manifestation of a math equation, that it was possible that I'd...well, accidentally blown a goddamn hole in the fabric of reality. To talk to a pretty girl, in dreams that I didn't remember...and she actually talks about dreams in a lot of her recent art. I'm basically talking about Astral Projection, to be clear. The fascinating thing is that it actually would've made sense, because she's been addressing this person, whose identity is ambiguous, since her first EP. There's a song on it called ""Empty Gold"" in which she says ""Baby don't let winter come, don't let our hearts freeze."" These aren't the only references to this person in her songs either, and I'm going to keep listing them in another post.

So a couple months ago she released a collection of poetry, and this person is referenced over and over again. I'm going to give some examples tomorrow. I'm also going to give examples of how other artists got in on this idea...no, I'm not kidding. It's subtle, but references to her art are there. She's now teasing secrets in a promotional manner, and apparently the last secret is ""out of this world."" I came up with all of this months before any secrets were mentioned, by the way. She's mentioned that there are puzzles in her albums too, and that she's been working on some of these secrets for years. I'm not even mad at her for ruining my life anymore, as I've been meditating and exercising a lot to try to get my mind off the whole thing. I'm just seriously concerned that she's not doing too well and that it could hurt other people too. Is Halsey ok?

490,Why am I like this?,"I’m fourteen years old and currently in my freshman year of high school. Ever since I was a small child, I’ve been terrified of the idea of any performance-based activities or similar. Participating in gym, raising my hand in class, getting up to get a tissue, presenting a project, ordering my own food, stuff like that. I remember I would almost cry every time I got a question wrong or had to present in class, even up to middle school. 

For the second semester of seventh grade, I transferred to online school. I have been without human interaction for about two years now. This fear of social interaction has become very severe because of it. Before, it was hard but tolerable. It’s just horrible now. I can’t do anything at all. It’s just so hard and no one understands. My mother gets so angry when I don’t participate in class. I try to tell her how difficult it is, but she doesn’t understand. I don’t think anyone could ever understand me. They could never even begin to fathom how painful it is for me to do things that normal people have no problem with. It makes me so angry. I’m tired of being weak. 

No matter what I do, I’m always looking from the sidelines. I just watch while my friends play online games together, while everyone gets a boyfriend, while everyone makes friends. 

I’ve become suicidal, mostly because of school. I just can’t do it anymore. I feel so trapped. I’m struggling so much in my FRESHMAN year of high school. If I can’t do this year, then there truly is no hope for me. No one gets it. My friends are all doing well in school. Why does it have to be me? My mother is so disappointed in me. I don’t think I could ever make it through life, I’m too weak. 

I can think of a few causes for my poor academic performance. A few months ago, we found out that my sister has been self harming. I remember it very vividly. Basically, my sister had cut her arm too deep and thought she was going to die. She was screaming and crying, saying “I’m sorry” over and over while my mother was yelling. I think it was the worst day of my life, it triggered a lot of chain events that have caused me trouble. Every time I hear someone screaming, I feel such an intense dread. I hate it. 

I’m very selfish. I’ve never felt empathy or sympathy for my sister or anyone other than me. Well, mostly. For a long time, I’ve been infatuated with mass shootings. It makes no sense. I feel sympathy for those stupid school shooters instead of the victims. In my mind, I think about how much it takes for you to commit something like that. How much pain you have to be in? But maybe some people are just evil. It’s like, why would you waste your life? You could have been happy with a normal life if you had gotten help. But you threw it all away, for what? To kill three people? It’s pitiful. 

I hate myself for being obsessed with this. Everyone will always see me as an immature, edgy, 14 year old girl who is in love with school shooters. Even though I have no romantic interest in those imbeciles, people wouldn’t listen. I don’t understand why someone would even have a crush on a killer anyway. Are you an idiot? You really think a school shooter would fall in love with you, have some sort of soft spot for you? Stop being stupid and come back to reality. It’s embarrassing, honestly. 

Even though I generally dislike killers, it’s not because I have morals or something like that. If anything, it’s admirable that a mass shooter was even able to get the courage to execute their plan. I could never do that.

 I don’t have any strong opinions about anything, whether it be on the concept of murder or something else. I see people who are very passionate about equality, it makes no sense to me. If you’re black and you support and fight for BLM, then that’s sensible. But I don’t understand why a white person would be so passionate about that. It’s doesn’t concern you, so why do you care so much? I don’t understand at all. Same thing goes for death. Sometimes I watch the news with my mother and something like “young woman murdered” comes up and she gets all sad and teary eyed. It doesn’t make sense. Why would you feel sad about them when you don’t even know them? You didn’t know the chick who died, so why do you care? 

There has been a lot of death in my life, but I haven’t felt upset over any of them. My grandfather, my grandmother, several family pets. Death happens. Get over it. There’s no point in crying, it won’t get you anywhere. It’s so annoying when someone dies. (It is kind of nice when someone close to me dies, though. I can get out of school to attend the funeral or get an excuse to do poorly in school.) I always have to pretend like I care about things like that. “Oh it’s so sad, your mother died.” I really couldn’t give a fuck. “The police are horrible for killing that black man.” I always have to say things like that to preserve my image. 

Most of the time when people die, they had it coming. Some girl takes a jog in the middle of nowhere at four in the morning, what did you expect? If you were smarter then you wouldn’t have gotten killed. People like that don’t deserve sympathy. Wow, I’m so selfish. I can’t spare sympathy for someone else but expect people to do it for me. 

I’ve noticed that my thoughts often contradict my actions. My emotions have a lot of control over me, especially when it comes to social interaction.

I’m kind of messed up, I think. I remember getting into cnc, rape, and somnophilia when I was around ten. I would terrorize my pets with a bb gun because it was funny when they got scared. I used to hate myself for being into that kind of stuff. I’m not a very good person. It’s funny, people see me as a shy girl who never speaks. It’s so funny. I just want to be seen as powerful for once.

This will be very embarrassing if no one responds. Please do not subject me to such humiliation. Anyways, I just want to know. Am I normal?"
491,suicide,"i don't know what to do. i'm so tired. i'm no longer going through treatment for my mental health issues. and that in combination with my personal issues and worldwide issues is just. too much. i don't want to do this anymore. i just want someone to care. but it feels like nobody does. and i can't tell if that feeling is real. i'm sad, i just want it to stop."
492,Constant panic about death,"Throwaway because I wouldn’t normally post this but I can’t get scheduled with a therapist until March and this is ruining my life. I don’t know what to do until then or if therapy will even help. 

I am in a near-constant state of panic about my own death. There is no reason for this. I am young, healthy, and I don’t even work/go out into the community so it’s not about COVID. I don’t have any close friends/family who have died either. Nevertheless, at least three times a day I am hit with overwhelming panic and sadness about my own death. Even the thought of death peacefully at an old age. 

It has gotten to the point where everything can trigger it—it used to be just death, but now even words like “lifetime” set me off or watching people go through life milestones. I cry, I have panic attacks—I barely sleep. I avoid things that I know will set me off and stay constantly busy to avoid falling into a panic. 

This is absolutely ruining my life, my sleep schedule, and my relationship with the world around me. I feel terrible, and I don’t know how to make it better in any way. This has gone beyond just a phobia or normal anxiety around a tough subject—I can barely function, and my life is starting to revolve around this fear and anxiety. I don’t know what to do."
493,Is it mental illness or am I under spell,"So about half a year ago, I was having a hard time mentally, like constant worry and deoression. And like other people in their hard time, I had some occassional recovery time on and off. So I was at my recovery time and chatting with my friends and I was having a good time. And suddenly this person, who is also a friend and one of the very few people to know about my current mental hardship, chat with me. I suddenly fell off and did not want to reply to her. However, I thought that would be rude and anyway, not replying to her back even increased my worry more so I just replied to her back. Then she replied back with one sentence that only complained about her having some personal issue. Then suddenly I felt really terrible inside because I did not want to have the same problem as hers. I did not know she did that on purpose or not but it was just like I panicked inside and constantly thought that maybe she knew I was having a mentally fragile moment in my life and she took advantage of it to transfer her problems to me or to put me under some kinds of spell. And after that, everything about me changed, to the direction that I had to fall in love to her and put her to ahead of every aspect in my life.  I turned straght (and I was gay before). It scared me when I thought I would love or like anybody over her because I thought that I would lose relationship with that somebody. When I grew fond of somebody or something, a passing thought of her or anything related made me not like that anymore. I don't know but I feel like I am cursed. Its been over half a year now and I don't know how to deal with this. So do I some mental illness or am I under some spell/ magic? Thank you"
494,Is this normal?,"why’s it that when i get a lil bit sad i cannot remember why i was even happy and when I’m happy i don’t see any reason that would make me sad ?? How can i detach myself from emotions i felt 5 minutes ago like that? I think that I am happy most of the time. Most days, i love life, but like once or twice a week, i get really sad. And i just feel like my sad states are soooo deeply felt that i can’t fathom what it’s like to be happy and i am aware that I’m a happy person but i cant seem to channel that same joyous energy when I’m sad and i wish i could :|"
495,Are emotions legit when a woman is on her period?,I don't know whether my emotions are legit while I'm on my period because being on my period heightens how I feel.
496,What’s wrong with me?,"So, this may be the wrong place for this, and I’m not sure if I’m venting or lost or what. But I just wish I had that first initial thing when you talk to someone for the first time. When you want to talk all day, when you want to just get to know that person and all the flirting and sexting. I know most people here have it way worse then me, but I just wanted to anonymously vent. I’m an attractive 23 year old guy. I find a women who I like and we have that initial response but then out of no where I get lonely and leave that person and stay lonely for months until I decide to try and find someone new... I dont know how to break this cycle of mommy issues and loneliness."
497,Anyone else hate being asked if you're okay?,"It's so nice, obviously you should ask people if they're okay if you don't think they are. 

But for some reason I can't stand it. Mainly because I know my action plan if I were in trouble and it doesn't involve dumping my situation (diagnosed bipolar and bulimia) on someone not-trained or who will react emotionally. 

I think with mental illness, especially bipolar, we're constantly checking ourselves and our impact on those around us incase we're entering an episode. So when someone says ""I'm concerned for you"" it either means we missed the signs, which is terrifying, or we're actually okay and it sounds extremely condescending. 

I'm home for the holidays and my mum has repeatedly been saying ""i'm concerned for you"". I'm trying fight incoming episode that hasn't hit yet and I just need some time to mentally prepare and put my action plans in place. I can't tell her what is going on because she will panic and escalate things, but I also don't know how to tell her she is making it worse by getting frustrated at me for needing to be alone and dismissing her concern. 

I hope i'm not alone in this, but I also don't want people to stop checking in on others."
498,I can't quit the military,"So I'm 20 years old and I live in poor country. Securing a futur isn't actually easy as you can study hard and degrees and just end up jobless. I got into the military academy even tho I never really liked the army or thought of joining it. My only reason of getting in was my family as they're the ones who convinced me to do it but oh my do I regret what I did now. I hate being in the military so fucking much most people are just assholes and idiots with only one or two braincells. I never thought my life's gonna end up like this. Doing something I really hate just for the sake of my family's approval and a ""good futur"" like they say.. I need to study for a whole of 5 years and then work for 15 to do my contract and I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do so as my mental health is deteriorating everyday because of the regretting of not taking my chance to study and actually try to do a job that I'm into instead of just giving up my life."
499,Anxiety out of control today,"I don't know what triggered it, but I'm having a terrible day. I feel like I've alienated my friends even though I have no reason to believe it. I just feel fucking lonely and I don't know who to talk to about it"
500,Does this sound like stress or depression? Or something else?,"I'm diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, major depression, autism and ADHD. Generally speaking the last few years my mental health has been a lot better, and I hand't thought that these periods would count as an episode of depression as it doesn't really have the emotional aspect that I usually experience - feeling down, worthless, sadness, sick of life, etc. But I'm struggling to put a name on it.

Sometimes, I just get so tired for like a month or more at a time. Where I don't want to do anything because I feel too tired and like its too difficult. I fall behind in my studies, I don't take shifts at work, I don't clean or cook except when my support worker visits, I don't shower very often, etc. But I can muster up energy and excitement for like a day or so before I run out of steam again. I just recently visited my dad for Christmas and you'd never know I was tired like this because I was super helpful with cooking, cleaning, etc for the first few days I was there. The last few days I wasn't but I think I got away with not being obvious. And the part that makes it seem most like depression is that I get REALLY sleepy. Not just tired during the day, but I end up actually sleeping for like 12, 13, 14 hours some nights.

I know its triggered by stress, because first I was worried about Christmas coming up, about making travel plans, buying gifts and taking enough shifts to have enough money. And then I was worried about how behind I had gotten in my studies - I'm about a month behind after some catch up - and then now I'm stressed because I have no money because I didn't take any shifts the week of Christmas so I have to wait until I get my disability pension on Tuesday to go grocery shopping but I'm out of food. But I know all these things could be improved if I actually did something about them, I should have taken shifts this week but I cancelled all of them, I could probably feel less tired if I went for a walk or did things during the day instead of obsessively playing Minecraft, and I could probably catch up on my studies instead of having to drop the class if I actually just sat down and studied a bit every day, but I haven't studied all week.

But again, I'm not feeling ""depressed"" like I have in the past. I'm feeling a bit worried about all the responsibilities I'm neglecting, and I'm feeling frustrated and annoyed at myself for doing nothing even though every day I keep telling myself I'll do better tomorrow, but I'm not feeling sad or anything else like that, and I'm not having very negative thoughts. And I've done a lot of therapy over many years, so I can tell I'm not currently ruminating on anything or having distorted thinking about anything.

I've tried bringing this up with my psychiatrist and with my psychologist, but I'm not sure they really understand what I'm trying to say and haven't offered any useful suggestions. I feel like I'm in this state about 50% of my time, so I'd really appreciate anyone weighing in or offering suggestions.

Thanks in advance!"
501,My current accomodation is affecting my mental well being,I moved in June 2017 and Everything was fine. But then in 2018 they made a repair to the elevator room which is directly above my flat! And ever since I've had to deal with the noise of the elevators every time they are being used and with over 100 people living here it's unbearable the noise seems to keep getting louder every few weeks I discussed this with my housing officer when it first started occuring and he said theirs nothing they can do. I have to sleep with YouTube white noise videos and headphones just so I can't hear it. I also cannot relax in my own home and during last year's locked down it's causing me severe stress!   The only room I can't hear it is the bathroom which unfortunately is too small to sleep in I usually take 3 hour baths just to get s break from the noise and when I'm not I constantly have earphones in! I try to go out as much as possible just to get away. But the noise is worse now than ever I have applied for numerous other housings but idk how long that's going to take.  Sorry I just don't know what else I can do I don't even know how to soundproof the rooms cause the walls literally made of cardboard and the ceilings not even concrete either
502,Is my situation normal?,"Hello everybody,

I am a 32 year old woman. I started working at the age of 14 whilst attending high school. I became financially independent at a young age due to unstable parents and lack of a support network. At age 18, I started university after over dedicating myself to my studies in my final year of school. Some friends said I took studying and a desire for perfect scores too far. My university was two hours away from home. I also started working full-time at age 18 and continue to do so today. 

After all this, I feel a little exhausted. I feel like it's not normal for someone to have worked this hard at such a young age. Generally speaking, what percentage of people work this hard from age 14 to mid adulthood? I feel like alot of women have had it too easy and I feel like the odd one out. I just want reassurance that what I did is commonplace.

Thanks!"
503,Need some advice,"I hope you all are doing well today! My girlfriend is currently hospitalized in a psychiatric facility(I’m so sorry if that’s the wrong name for it) and she should be getting out sometime this coming week. She has been dealing with severe anxiety the past couple months. She has described it as just being “so overwhelmed” some background on it, her grandmother passed away in August and I believe it finally just settled in specially as the holidays approached. She takes medication for anxiety and depression so they just switched her medicine like she’s been wanting to do so that’s a plus. Anyways my question here is what’s the best way to support her when she gets out? And if you guys have experienced this what Best helped you/ appreciated? I’m already prepared to ease her back into everything. I just want to make sure she’s as comfortable as she can be. So I thought I’d take it to Reddit to better educate myself on a lot of topics regarding this. Very much appreciated to whoever will answer! When we do get to call I try to distract her away from the subject, I try not to surround the call with me asking a million questions so I decided to save that for later when she’s out and ready to openly talk about things. She’s in good spirits cracked some jokes with me and is smiling(we got to video chat on Saturday) she did say she was feeling anxious but she said she’s learning to cope with it better on her own which is a fantastic win I tell her how much progress she’s making in the days she’s been there already."
504,Can they force someone to take medication in the mental hospital?,"I've been struggling hard recently. A lot of shit has happened to me in these past two years and I'm starting to get suicidal. I have people to live for so I need to get better, and I was thinking of putting myself in the mental hospital. I'm 19 (almost 20) and live in California and before I do this I need to know if they'll force me to take medication that I dont want to take. I need to be prepared"
505,Keeping a pet / animal to help anxiety attacks,"hello all, this is my first post on this subreddit, hope everyone's had a good new year's.
I've been thinking of getting a small animal, rodent type for me to look after and to help with my anxiety.
two problems, I have a dog but he doesn't have acsess into my bedroom because I live in a loft suspended by a ladder and it's impossible for him to get up, though I'm worried he'll know there's an animal in there and won't leave me alone. on the other hand I have an adult sister who not only treats me like a piece of shit and purely let's out all her anger onto me, but I'm worried she'll take the pet downstairs.. I would obviously keep a policy to not let her touch it until she gets my consent but I'm just worried if she's gonna take it when I'm out the house and it's just making me reconsider all this if it is a good idea, if it's actually worth it? because I don't want to be worried over small things about this.."
506,Reconciliation of Academic Bullying," Hi, I would like to gain greater reconciliation of academic bullying to facilitate my graduate admission.  
**1) How had you deal with bullying from people who have higher power than you** (be it in the academic or workplace setting)?  
My supervisor and this team did not offer much support to my honors thesis. The support that they gave was to ensure that you did the transcription and translation correctly as they would use it for their national-level research project. There was once a research staff shouted at and scolded harshly for not doing my transcription and translation properly. It is true that I did not do my transcription and translation well. Honestly, I did not know the way that I did was incorrect when I first did it. I learned to listen to audio recordings with the context in mind.

As for other aspects of my thesis, they would give superficial comments on what you had written. When I clarified with them on the comments, they would explain vaguely. When I asked further, they get frustrated, sighed, and gave a look of disdain.

I am angry towards my supervisor and his staff for bullying me.I am angry towards myself for being submissive (for not standing up for myself - I was afraid of the repercussion). I felt hurt. I felt upset with this thesis experiences for affecting my confidence of getting into a clinical psychology programme as it had tarnished my research confidence \[but, I will build that up\].

**2) What would you have done differently from what I did?**  
For me, I would not have done anything differently. I would still choose the submissive route so as to not burn the bridge. Am I too submissive?

Thank you!"
507,I think I have complex ptsd,"I’m diagnosed with PTSD, but I believe it’s complex PTSD from constant abuse, gaslighting, physical, mental, psychological, and emotional abuse for the past seven years a row. 

Here area some things I struggle with that are relatable, anyone else?: 

unhealthy sleeping patterns, awful memory, self blame for everything, feeling the need to be called crazy or psycho, put me in my spot, trouble remembering traumatic events that have happened to be, unwanted dreams, racing thoughts, lack of concentration, feeling worthless, and avoidance of certain trauma like music or food or places.

There’s more. Anyone feel the same?

I’m in therapy and on psychiatric meds too btw."
508,"People who actually say ""We're there for you, talk to us"" don't actually be there and after a while your suicidal/self harm instincts is just a joke to them.","I don't understand how telling me to forget it will help me..I know I'm diagnosed with depression, that doesn't mean I literally have no ability to even think that forgetting is the best option. Things aren't working out and I've tried multiple distractions, stop saying you'll be there for me if you never wanna hear me talk about my depression.. sometimes I just need a hug without having to ask for it."
509,Update from my last post,"I don’t know how to link the post but you can probably find it. So I broke up with my girlfriend so she said I sent her something on Instagram and I said I did not. She kept on saying I did I repeatedly told her I did not this went on for around an hour and then I blocked her because I didn’t want to deal with that. Now before  go on about what happens next. I suffer from dislxia depression and anxiety. Now after I blocked her her apartment girlfriend texted me a big long message that I don’t even remember now. But I asked can you please leave me alone. She said yes and I said bye. But I spelt it bui for some reason and this is where everything happens. First she says bui? Can you even talk right you dislexic bitch. Said sorry about that. Then she said I was homophobic. First off there is no way I’m homophobic. One of my best friends is a lesbian and my uncles are gay. I say I’m not homophobic bringing up my friend and uncles. Then she said so what do they have to do with this. So then she goes on and on about how I get no puss and how I’m such a piece of shit. Then the conversation ends when she brings up my dad. She says specifically “I bet your dad divorced your mom and that’s why you have no father figure”. Now one thing with me is you don’t fuck with my dad. He is in the navy works his ass off loves what he does. He’s is on deployment for 8 out of 12 months a year. But I blocked her after this. 

I don’t know what to do I already blocked but apparently she’s telling my friends that live in another city I called her hoe. Any advice"
510,I can’t imagine how I’d ever become social and have a real life,"I’ve always wanted to have a small circle of friends or people I trusted because as a kid I realized I couldn’t trust my family. But after trying really, embarrassingly hard to make friends and forcing myself to be social, it all fell apart and I don’t know if my trying to make friends was done too little or if I did too much. I did get some socializing when I had a job 4 years ago, but had to quit due to my knee hurting all the time (I had been working on a fractured knee) after one year. 3 years later, being stuck at home and being sent in circles by doctors and not getting treatment, I don’t know how I’d ever be comfortable working or being around strangers again.

The idea makes me sick and anxious, even though I want it so badly. I also dreamt of being a wife and mom, I wanted my own family that didn’t leave or hurt me emotionally. Now, I’m trying to get over the fact I won’t have my own family and I’ll be stuck living with my mom until one of us dies. 

I know I sound like a cry baby, I know I’m at fault for all my problems and not fixing them sooner instead of being sorry for myself at nearly 30. It all doesn’t seem fair, only because I tried so very hard. I actually tried! I don’t know what I did wrong; I think I’m just a very unlikeable person, I’m not a good person either, and I’m mean and selfish - maybe I deserve all this heavy pain inside. I don’t know exactly what I did to deserve all of this pain, it’s more than likely what I deserve. I just want to get over it already and accept I’ll never be anything more than an annoying ghost or sick pet my mom can’t get rid of.

I don’t blame anyone for any of this, really. I chose the paths that led me here, so I only have myself to blame. I’m such an idiot."
511,Need advice: I thought he got better? Parental obsession with reading my journals &amp; knowing my secrets.,"One of my parents has always had a relentless habit of listening through walls, asking everyone about gossip, checking internet history, studying internet and texting activity, studying router history, and going so far as to read my journals and a blog once. I grew up with this but had good reasons to believe he was done with this behavior a few years ago. I think I might be wrong but I sincerely need help understanding if I’m right or not? 

I had forgiven him for reading my journals about 6 years ago, but found a written journal of mine in plain sight at home this past week over the holiday. The last time I was here was 5 months ago, and I have to accept that he most likely had read it at least once if not made a copy to save for later. Knowing this is the most likely scenario, I have realized he is still the same person he’s always been.

What do I do now? I’m so upset, I go to therapy but haven’t able to because of the holidays recently.

I feel most inclined to say nothing and slowly cut him off, but what would you do? I thought he wouldn’t do this again. I was wrong. I want to ask if he read it, but there is no point. If he had access to it while I wasn’t around, he most definitely read it. I’m scared to reread it even though I want to know what is going on. He’s been acting so out of character the last few weeks, but has told me it’s probably my fault for being “suspicious of good behavior”???

TLDR: father has always been a snoop, and read my journal years ago thinking I wouldn’t know. I did know and find out, implemented space, forgave him, moved on, and then after a few years I recently found my journal at home while gets been able really weird. He most likely has read it. What to do next?"
512,"Does anyone else just suddenly loose your fears or anxiety when you close your eyes tight when you're really anxious or in fear, then when you reopen your eyes it all returns?",Like I was staring at the darkness in absolute fear and when I closed my eyes while looking away I felt really secure and fearless until I reopened them...
513,My boyfriend is withdrawing from me - how can I help him?,
514,"Any advice/tips how to focus on the ""now"" and beat severe anxiety?","Just a few weeks I ""realised"" something bad will happen, someone will die, etc., just like it happens in everybody's life, it will ""hit"" me as well. Especially the fear of someone's death is the thing. I had similar anxiety plus depression two years ago, I thought I had beaten that for good but here it is again. I lost apetite, I don't sleep well, stay in bed too long, lost desire to do or achieve anything, no drive etc.  


From rational point of view it is madness to just sit and wait for something bad to happen or to be ""prepared"" beforehand for it by being on stand by, that's how the severe anxiety feels. It is madness, it is just absurd, but you can't convince your fears with rational arguments - if you are afraid of heights, you are still afraid even though you are safe on the balcony and can't fall; if you are terribily afraid of dogs the rational explanation that a cute little doggy can't do you no harm, doesn't really help you, etc.  


I get especially frustrated and angry with my condition because just a few days before this hit I started so many new things, courses, studying for a career change, etc., and now this thing is getting in my the way of having a not easy and happy, but a PRODUCTIVE and MEANINGFUL life

519,January 2 2021 Had a vivid dream,"January 2 2021 

Had a vivid dream that my wife was getting remarried on me. At first I was scared to hear the news from her friend, but then I remembered who the fuck I was. I got the date of the ceremony and busted through the door so fast with my car still on outside. I saw her in a all white dress, she looked so beautiful. We made eye contact, and she ran towards me. We grabbed each others hands and ran together to my car. we drove off with all our problems behind us. As we drove nothing mattered except that we where together at that moment. We drove for hours taking about the future and times that we’ve had. She thanked me for coming through to save the day. I just laughed and told her not to worry. She smiled back at me as we drove into the sunset."

521,How can I support a friend on the other side of the country?,"Hey everyone, 

One of my close childhood friends, (primary and high school together, one of my groomsmen) moved across the country for work a few years ago and has recently started sharing that he’s struggling with his mental health (depression, self harming). He’s undergoing treatment, but my question is: how can I support him while I’m so far away? 

Thanks everyone"
522,I was exposed to violence as a child and now i am (17f) still scared of my parents even though they don't do that anymore,"Firstly, i just can't get professional help. I don't live in a first world country

I remember being kicked on the floor as a child, i never knew it'd still affect me when I'm 17. I realize that whenever my dad asks me something i get tensed, it again makes my dad angry, he asks me ""Why are you so tensed while talking to me?""

I can't judge them tho, they're doing what their parents did to them. During my adolescence crisis they were telling me ""We didn't have such thing called adolescence crisis, because our parents spanked us and it went away"" i got it as a threat, i still don't know what they meant by it but they never beat me for having adolescence crisis at least 

To be honest they've always been showering me with love but still it's like giving a starveling person chic clothes; he might like the clothes but it doesn't change the fact that he's starving

I have maybe hundreds of good childhood memories but when someone makes me recall my childhood, only the bad ones come to my mind. This part is my problem imo

And some days ago i experienced something bad. A guy i once knew texted me on Instagram confessed me his feelings. For the first time in my life I've been asked out for a date. But it gave me chills, i got a panic attack that moment. I was barely breathing and my heart almost stopped

Because his having feelings for me made me think about my parents. I was thinking like ""What if he rapes me just because i rejected him and my parents blame me for it? Or what if he murders me just because I rejected him and my parents still blame me for it?"" (Femicides for such reasons are common in my country) 

I didn't know what to do, so texted my friends. Even one of them told me ""You're not that scared of the possibility that he might rape you but you're scared of the possibility that your parents might blame you. Don't your parents love you at all?"" her words affected me so much. And it was a fact, i wasn't scared of the guy, i was scared of my parents

Anyway i couldn't text the guy back so my friend rejected him from my account in the name of me. And his reaction was so damn natural. He just said ""It's okay then take care of yourself, i knew you were impossible for me"". I was relieved after a such calm message of course

What can i do? How can i beat my fears? And my parents don't even committing violence against me anymore. Even when they raise their voice a little bit i feel like crying"
523,"Normal, Sociopath, Psychopath or Whatever","I dont usually feel the empathy to the situations where peoole usually feel it.

The disturbing thing is inside my mind, I grinned a little. Im 27 now. Ive searched the traits of a psychopath and sociopath and now Im confused because I still feel that I would vomit for extremely gory things.(I have a little bit high tolerance) I still feel sad and cry a little bit if I read or watch scenes in movies or dramas that will really take ur soul. But in real life, lets say 60-70% of the time I feel empty. I only get emotions if Im with my fiance and in work or with friends, mostly I just show fake emotions to go along but inside my mind, Im just having a poker face feeling empty. I thunj my situation is disturbing. Can anybody explain something.Please help me."
524,I want to help my friend and I dont know how to. Please help,"I'm sorry if this is not the place I should be posting. This is going to be extremely long and very messy with no proper formatting please bear with me.

 My (18F) friend (19M) is struggling with depression. He used to be my senior in school and we were never close but we care about each other and were good friends?. I knew he wasn't completely fine but thought he was handling it. Until recently, like a month or so ago, when one night we were randomly talking and I was teasing him that he looks really pretty the conversation went somewhere else. He was saying something about girls don't like music nerds or something and I was like bruh girls really don't care and he said something along the lines of - "" this is not my cup of tea; I'll just sit in a corner and listen to music , all by myself; One day; I'll get up; From the corner; Walk up to the middle of the room; And hang myself; Epicly; ""  I was too shocked with where this conversation went suddenly and all I could say was woah and he said - ""Nobody to stop either"" and I said ""why"" and he went - ""3rd times the charm"" and I was just shook and caught off guard and all I could manage to say was "" You've tried twice?"" and he goes ""Well I suck at doing it too, I'm still here"" and I didn't know what to even say I sent some fucking stupid sticker or some shit and he goes to the whole ""You leave all this ATB for your exam"", typical deflecting. And like a dumb person I was like ""Get Help senior"" and he's like ""Lol there's no help junior; You've gotta do it in your own;"" and stuff if anyone wants the screenshots pm me but how it went after that was him saying things aren't easy you cant just get up and get help and that he doesn't want me to worry and I told him how it matters to me a lot since he's legit like one of my two friends and how I don't want him ever trying a third. And it ended up him saying something like ""Stop thinking you could save me or something lol"" and I didn't know what to say and I'm just like "" idc might as well save you. Doesn't hurt to try does it "" and he does the whole ""good night go sleep"" thing. 

I stayed up that night thinking how do I help him, what do I say to him. I have a history of self harm and I never got help myself anybody who ever tried saying yOu CaN tAlK tO mE I could never accept they meant it, it always felt like they're just saying it because they're supposed to or just for the sake of it. I don't even know how things changed. Well anyways the main point is I couldn't figure out what do I say to him so that he doesn't feel that way so that he doesn't feel I'm just saying it for the sake of saying it.  

I'm not a texter or a talker. Idk I prolly used to be one once upon a time but haven't been one for a few years now and talking to people everyday is something I can't but I kinda made it a point to start texting him each day with atleast a Good Morning, How you doing, Sup, Have a nice day or such. And like 8 days later or something I sent him - "" Btw might sound dumb or something but eh I'm here if you ever wanna speak about how hard things are or just talk about how you're feeling; I've tried rephrasing it and thinking over how to say it better for days so that you don't think it's stupid or uk cliché or formality or  whatever but I couldn't come up with anything better""

It's been a month and everyday I make sure to text him once a day and I really want to help him and I don't know how to. Once in a while he drops a message and it again leaves me wondering how do I help him. Like today I was like Good Afternoon ; Have a nice day and He went ""Lol I try"" and I was like ""that's enough :)"" and he goes  ""Who am I kidding; I don't even try; I fetishize my own sadness"" and like one crazy ass dumb person I go ""And even that's okay"" (I know I don't know why the fyck would I say something like that that's probably not the right thing to say at all I'm so stupid) And he said "" No it's not lmao "" and I say ""It actually is"" (again, I've the brain cells of a grass) and I say ""You cant expect yourself to wake up one day and be like lmao sad who"" and he replies to his 'I fetishize my own sadness' message with "" What do you think this means"" and I try explaining and he just changes the topic asking about exams and classes. And I say ""Did you altogether Ignore it"" And he says "" I changed the topic"" and I say I googled it and he says ""Oh cool"" and I send "" have an excessive and irrational commitment to; your own sadness"" and he says ""Sure  ; Leave""

And it dawns upon me I sometimes speak like a fucktard and I really want to help him and I so don't know what to say Please help me out How do I help him feel better or make him get help I just want him to get better before its too late"

At one point during the phone call, I said something like, as sad as it is, I dont judge anyone for making the decision to end it and that if someone has got to that point in their life, then who are we to comment. 
It's just their time.

My mum txt me later that day and mentioned that she picked up on the comment and is worried that I might not be doing so well myself and that she's been worried lately, or that it has crossed her mind lately that I may take action too.
Mum's have that 6th sense I guess 🤷‍♂️
Because lately I've (33M) been having some serious suicidal thoughts. 
Since this kid took his own life, it hasn't made me have those thoughts any less but it's made me think about who it would hurt if I was to go through with it.
Honestly, my kids are the only ones I'm worried about hurting. I don't really feel like anyone else cares.
I mean, I'm sure they do, but it doesn't feel like it.
But I think about what sort of affect that would have on my kids. 
And it kills me to imagine them struggling through life withought me.
I'm really close to my 3 sons. They're my best friends
At times it feels like they're my only friends. And the only people that care about me.
They're the reason I got clean and sober 2 and a half years ago. 
They're the reason I wake up and go to work every day, because they deserve a good life. 
They're the only reason I smile.
And if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have made it to 33.
So yes I'm suicidal, yes I want to die.
But those 3 boys... They need me.
And I need them even more. And they save me time and time again.
They save my life every single day.
And even though I try my best for them, nothing will ever repay what they do for me each day"
528,Not feeling normal,"Hey Reddit, had my house broken into christmas morning in The US , ended up scaring who ever it was by making a lot of noise and loading my firearm, called the cops they showed up searched the house did all the paper work but over a week now and I still can’t sleep at night, still don’t feel safe in my house with my wife and kids I feel like I’m always on guard. Like I wake up at the slightest movement if I fall asleep at all. My hearts racing just thinking about it. Anxiety has been everywhere lately. Anyone going through something similar or have any tips. Thank you in advance"
529,I got people in my circle but i feel extremely lonely most of the time.,"tonight while getting high i ended up reflecting on this a bit more. I feel that the trust and love from my family feels extremely superficial and shallow. Its unfortunately been like this since i was in highschool , and to add to it all my friends who've i had since highschool are all gone. Its been 4 years now since i last talked to anyone ,nobody said "" goodbye"",""see you soon"" or even came back to check on me, it literally felt like they all just faded away. I got one new friend from 3 years ago that i met but now that im probably gonna move due to the pademic its most likely we're gonna be seeing each other less now. All i ask is how did you overcome this? Did meeting a significant lover change this? Or did it still feel the same? Is your reason for starting a family this exact issue that you once had?"

531,Struggling to get over financial loss,"This problem may seem insignifant to most but I really need to share with anyone. 

I am 33 years old and I worked hard for years. Managed to get a mortgage and had a nice job. This year I suffered a major bout of depression, and with being so isolated from family and friends during this time the boredom really got the best of me. I started behaving recklessly with my money. Silly risky investments, betting, lottery etc.

Long story short I lost everything I've worked all these years for. My home, my job. All my money. I've gone pretty much bankrupt. 

I worked so hard all these years to build a life for myself and I've thrown it all away in just a few months. 

II have been really struggling to come to terms with this. I've resorted to drinking most days as I feel hopeless. How can I rebuild from scratch? 

If anyone has any advice on how to cope with this please let me know."
532,Its the first time I'm going through depression and anxiety phases while being in a relationship and it's driving me crazy,"I'm 26 a years old girl. The past 4 months I've been in a serious relationship with a guy my age. Before that I only experienced hook-ups and short/unintense relationships, I actually thought I would never fall in love. But then I met him and we both fell super hard for each other. It was so intense and beautiful that I thought I would never be unhappy around him. But then my mood swings started kicking in. 

My mood changes very suddenly and sometimes for no reason, it's scary. I am used to spending these unhappy periods on my own, but now everything is different. We are the kind of couple who spends almost every day together cause we find it hard to stay away from each other. What happens is that I go from being extremely in love with him, to feeling nothing every once in a while for no reason. And this makes me super anxious and panicky. I am constantly afraid he will get tired of me, although he tells me I should take my time and he will be here for anything I need. And I am also afraid I will fall out of love and I don't want this to happen.

The thing is that lately he is also a bit flat, mostly because he hates his job. I hate my job too, and we spent hours discussing how we could both change jobs or find alternative ways of making money, but we are currently lockdowned and these are not easy decisions to make, which makes everything more stressful (the country we live in is poor and in financial crisis since years). Also, the quarantine has isolated us from everyone we know, so we basically only have each other, and it can get boring sometimes, cause all we do is work and hang out together, we don't have many stuff to do cause we are not allowed to exit our neighborhood, nothing is open, our friends live in other neighborhoods. Basically we both feel trapped in our jobs and houses, and we find it more and more difficult to cheer each other up. 

I just want to be happy again. I've been feeling worthless, ugly and unpleasant since 2 weeks, and I have constant anxiety that I am ruining my relationship. My head is a mess, I don't even know what I want/need/feel :("
533,Does anyone else become suddenly depressed when minor disappointing things happen?,"I'll give some examples. Today I got really excited that I was seeing my friend for the first time in many months and she cancelled suddenly. That made me really sad and reminded me how alone I am. I barely talk to my friends because they take a while to respond and by the time they do, it feels like it doesn't really matter anymore. 

Another example: I was excited that my family and I would be going to a waterfall. I don't leave the house much these days and when I heard we would actually go somewhere for a change, I got really excited, but my dad didn't want to drive us and he decided to do something in the garden instead. That had the same effect as my friend cancelling. I felt like I got excited for something and it turned into nothing and I'm sad again. I get reminded about all the bad thoughts in my head that I don't matter to anyone and that I'm never enough. It feels like it will always be this way and I hate it."
534,How to know where my mental health is?,"Like how good?? Uhh... anxiety...
I smoke a good amount of grass...?"
535,"my ex boyfriend (20M) is a compulsive liar, pretended he had another personality to cheat on me, lied about really fucked up things and faked his whole life. someone please help i dont know whats going on and i dont know what is wrong with him.","TW: childhood trauma, cheating

for context: ex bf (20M) and myself (20F)

hello, im not exactly sure which community to post this on but i just need help. if anyone has any recommendations of other communities this post would be more suited for please lmk.

so on january 1st i broke up with my cheating ex cause he fucked me over yet again. some context into our relationship: we had been dating for almost 3 years and after the first year and a half of our relationship we were constantly on and off from there until i finally just left. he was constantly cheating and lying to me in our relationship but i always took him back because he is very manipulative, convincing and charming. he knows how to lie really good. not only this but he would always act like a victim. but basically when i ended it he told me some pretty fucked stuff before i did and maybe someone would have some insight on this.

basically when we originally started dating he opened up about his past and said in his past his uncle raped him and abused him repeatedly as a child and his immediate family fucked him over as well, to the point where he felt unsafe in his own house and would think they were gunna rape him too. he insinuated that his own mother, brother &amp; father knew he was getting raped by his uncle and that is why he felt so unsafe in his house pretty much. there are more things i could go on about he told me but i am trying to condense everything. anyways, throughout our relationship when he would do fucked up things to me, he would use the reason of his childhood trauma for why he didnt understand things or he was taught this way so thats why he would do these things. so the night i ended it he just told me it was all a lie; all of his past was a lie he lied about being abused sexually and physically and all this shit for i dont even know the fuck why. his reasoning doesnt make sense and he told me that he lied about it so much that he believed it was real and he had traumatic nightmares of this fake childhood trauma etc. and he has lied about the ""childhood trauma"" to his friends too. but what the actual god damn fuck???????????? he says he wants to go to therapy but what is this?? how can he fake this to me for almost 3 years, i am thinking is he so delusional that he made this up because he's some fucked up sociopathic compulsive liar or did the stuff in the past actually happen and he's so delusional that he's convinced himself it didn't happen? i cant fathom how he would lie about all of this shit for basically no reason?

another thing i wanted to mention is when he cheated on me (some of the times that is) he claimed he had no control of his actions and felt like he was being controlled and basically that he had another personality 'controlling him'??? and i would talk to this other personality as to why it did it, i can deadass not make this shit up right now. the other ""personality"" was cold, blunt, emotionless and did stuff to understand things? he would talk differently when he had this other persona on. when he would cheat from the other personality doing it he would say he didnt remember it happening meaning he blacked out and it didnt feel like him when it was happening. he would get full on amnesia but then remember everything that happened later on and freak out that he hurt me yet again. like for example i found plan B in his room and he had no idea what it was from and doesnt remember anything happening but the later on he would remember as time went on. the other personality thing happened when he first started fucking other girls. and then after all this i was trying to help him, i researched a bunch of shit about BPD and DID etc.try to get him therapy because i thought something was genuinely wrong but now i dont even fucking know. bc the other personality magically disappeared and he is like he is not like that anymore he doesnt know why it happened. but he says that he really did not understand emotion and although the stuff in his childhood didnt happen he says he didnt understand things. that he didnt understand emotion and that before he met me he was numb but once he met me i made him feel emotions and all this happiness that he has never experienced before like he did with me he claims and he didnt get it. but why would he feel all numb and basically inhuman before he met me if nothing of the childhood trauma happened? he said before he met me he never felt close with anyone, not even his family and he never had a connection to anyone like he has to me and i guess thats why everything was so confusing to him? what? during the time of the other personality thing i also wanted to mention that he would switch from this personality to his regular self in person right in front of me. he would be the other personality then fall asleep for 5 mins or close his eyes kinda thing then return to his regular self and not know the other personality came and talked to me and asks me what happened and have no recollection?

he would also tell me that he hears voices in his head and they were saying morbid things, he says that there would be voices, screaming in his head and they would tell him shit like to harm people or cheat on me more? but then they stopped eventually? what? bro this makes no sense what is wrong with him because i dont get it. how do they stop? why would they only be there for a period of time? i was like is he schizophrenic but he cant be that if they just left and didnt come back? what the fuck

not only this but he is so delusional that he is convinced he is a good person and changed when he literally just fucked me over again and lied again? there is evidence directly in front of me and he is convinced that its not like that. i am in complete and utter disbelief of the betrayal of everything and this isnt even the HALF OF IT!!! i couldnt even begin to fully explain it; if anyone wants more context to understand this lmk bc there are many things im leaving out bc if i said everything this would be a book of everything fucked up about him.

no one is this fucked up for no reason someone please help because i can't believe this shit.

any insight is appreciated! (sorry this is a long read and i cant summarize this for a quick answer ahah)"

537,Apathy,"My coping mechanism is apathy and I don't know how to deal with it. Any bit of negative emotion I get, I only feel for 5 seconds before apathy kicks in, or it's more dominant than that emotion

I guess this is because I hate talking, even if to defend myself or give an explanation, so my reaction is just to cry while desperately trying to say what I wanna say. Since this isnt working, my brain probably made me apathetic instead so I would stop crying all the time.

I can barely feel anything. I don't know how to process my emotions and don't know how to react in negative situations. How do I deal with this?"
538,What mental illness means to me,"Everything is fine. You're lying comfortably on the couch, you're physically healthy, relaxing, know the bills are paid, have a good job. Yet somehow there is so much pain inside your mind. It feels infinitely heavy. It hurts, but there is nothing you can do about it. You have a vague idea of the reasons, but you can't understand it, you just want everything to stop. Purely existing is already exhausting. I realized that normal people don't feel like that, so I guess it's MI."
539,why am i always doubt every person that said that they like/love me? I just can't believe it. I cried every time they said it because i always feel like they are lying. i don't know why. is this normal? or is there something wrong with me?,?why am i always doubt every person that said that they like/love me? I just can't believe it. I cried every time they said it because i always feel like they are lying. i don't know why. is this normal? or is there something wrong with me?
540,I don't know how to move on from sexual assault,I was sexually assaulted by my ex boyfriend almost three years ago and while that wasn't horrible enough he gave me an sti with it. I couldn't even tell my parents. I needed to go to multiple doctors all by myself cause I couldn't tell a soul. I still feel ashamed of it and I feel like I have dirt on myself. I have flashbacks every time I wash myself and I am afraid it will always be like that. Physically I am healthy now but it still has huge impact on my mental and emotional health. I don't know how to move on with my life.
541,Feeling lonely,I yearn for approval of others. I want friends. I want people to like me but it seems like all I do is drift away. I’m up all night trying to distract myself and I sleep all day. My family is worried but they won’t understand. I haven’t talked to a friend in days. I just want company.
542,How tf do I get my bf to understand?,"How tf do I get my bf to understand my feelings and what I'm going through? I've made him watch several short films on YouTube about what I have to deal with and most of them being short films about extreme social anxiety. Then he's like ""But you can talk to me so what's the problem?"". Like are you fucking serious? I've even had an hour long conversation about how its so difficult for me to do simple activities because of the way my mental health has affected me. He still doesn't get it! And he just says ""Its in the past so get over it. Just be positive and think happy thoughts."". I know he doesn't mean it in a rude way, but he just doesn't get it. And them boom! Surprise pikachu face when I don't talk to him about my problems! He's the last person I go to for when it comes to mental support."
543,How to help partner with anxiety and motivation,"I have been living with my partner for over a year. We are both PhD students (completely different fields) and in our late twenties. I am writing here as I feel that I do not know how to help my partner with her struggles. My partner has had tendencies to be anxious and to be extremely self-doubting since I've met her, but lately I feel that sometimes things are getting a bit alarming and I would like to be able to give some support even though it seems as I am not really good at it.

Being PhD students we don't really have a fixed schedule for our work, but this flexibility has become a drawback as my partner often says the she is ""wasting her time"" while, for example, on weekend we do nothing around the house.   
Similarly, she always thinks of herself in a negative light expressing often how she is ""stupid"" (not silly, but more like dumb), ""ugly"", ""fat"", ""useless"", etc... Every time she says something like that I reply that that it's not true trying also to give some evidence, but I don't know if this is effective or not.

Furthermore, now she is having serious problems to get out of bed in the morning, even though we had a full night of sleep. I feel that this is due to her being scared to face the world outside the blankets, but I don't really know what would be best to do to.   
Also regarding motivation is her difficulty to decide what she wants to do. When we have some free time (in the evening for example) and I ask her what she would like to do a frequent reply is ""nothing"". I feel that I am not really creative in the thing that I offer her to do (mostly watch something or read), but as due to the current pandemic most of the possibilities for social activities have been shut down little else comes to mind. This is somewhat ironic as we moved to a big city to take advantage of the possibilities, but we ended up spending 99% of our time in our small apartment. Moving to a new city also resulted in knowing very few people to hang out with (in less stringent lockdown times). This has been an issue for both as, even before the pandemic, the lack of friends lead to many nights spent at home without any idea on what to do. 

I have brought up the idea of seeking help recently (but also in the past) to deal with her issues regarding her self-image and motivation, but her reply is that she does not want to go because she thinks that she is convinced on her ideas or just that she does not want to. I read online about the importance of being there for a person and I think that I am doing it, but it is hard to see somebody that you love in pain and not being able to do anything about it.   
I feel like I am trying to get her to share her burdens and help her to face them, but whenever we end up talking about them I feel like she just does not want to talk and think about them. This strategy also applies to issues during her studies.  
This is why I would appreciate any advice (even really simple and practical ones) that I could use to try to support her.

Sorry for the long and surely one-sided question/vent. 

Thanks."
544,my bunny just died,"my mental health has been fucked for the past month or so and a couple of hours ago i saw my first pet pass away in front of me, i had her for 5 years and admittedly enough i wasn't taking care of her as much as i should have lately because well i didn't have the energy to take care of myself most days either

i was on the verge of starting cutting again a couple of days ago and i feel like i'm going to give in today i just don't know what to do it was all so sudden... i've been crying for so long now, as if that's going to fix anything"
545,Just don't see the point anymore,"Life is just too much to handle anymore. I am so over having mental health and it weighing me down. 2011, I developed PTSD after a major car accident. 2012 I developed Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia and although I am better now my life is still so restricted. 2019 I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and 2020 I got diagnosed with Bipolar. Lime honestly, how much more can one person handle.

I have no social life because I can't even go anywhere because I can't drive due to my agoraphobia.
I have been single 6 years and I just sit here everyday being miserable and lonely and I just want someone to love me. 
I can't drink alcohol or do drugs because my anxiety is so bad. I have no outlet in life.
I loose all my friends because I can't do anything with them or my mental health gets in the way. 

I am 28 years old and I can not live another day. I am not strong enough. I don't wanna live, none of this is fair. I try so hard to get better, I see a therapist, I've done dbt, I take my meds, I go to the gym, I literally do everything I can and the world is still so against me."
546,I can’t work a job longer then 6 months,"I’m 19, and I’ve worked 10-12 jobs already, most fast food, warehouse, etc. 

For some reason, absolutely nothing I do changes how much I hate my job after I learn how to do it. I just get bored of it and start to look for a new job, and the cycle repeats. 

I’m unsure of what causes this and was hoping to know if this would match any symptoms"
547,How can I help my friend with bipolar disorder?,"So, around two months ago I got to know my crush (19F, she already rejected me lol) and she's pretty much my best friend. We know each other only online as we live in different countries and covid is a thing, so meeting up is planned but not gonna happen in the near future. As the title suggests she has bipolar disorder. She sometimes has episodes where she'll avoid social interaction and just see no reason to live other than in order to not sadden others. She can't bring herself to show her ""weak side"" to her psychiatrist and just says that she's fine. The episode she's in at the moment has been going on for pretty much a month now and she develops suicidal thoughts and she decided to go to the hospital which her psychiatrist had already suggested but she felt and still feels anxious about missing out on classes and things like that, so at first she declined. I write her whatever I can come up with as she enjoys reading whatever I write and I enjoy reading whatever she writes. My life is nothing spectacular, so when I can't come up with anything I just write about what I've been eating, small things like that. She says my texts manage to make her smile which is a feat during the episode, however I wanna really help her and I don't know how. Telling her what she already knows isn't helpful and I can't think of anything that's really helpful. I tell her my honest thoughts and feelings and it seems to momentarily help her but I'd like to support her properly. If there's any questions, please ask me, if you have any ideas, please tell me. Thanks for taking the time to read through this ^^"
548,being self destructive,"i’m not responding to friends messages which is making me feel even lonelier. i’m not doing my work which will make me more stressed and make everything worse. i’m not going outside and exercising which makes me not like myself even more. i’m not reaching out for help even though i want to. when asked if i’m okay, i lie and say i’m fine when i’m really not. why do i do this, and why can’t i stop?"

550,Is it normal for eye contact to feel uncomfortable?,"Im not sure if this is the best place to post this. 

I am wondering if it is normal to feel slightly uncomfortable with making eyecontact with others? Having been told that eyecontact is necessary all my life (when shaking hands, talking to someone, interviewing, etc), I am realising I almost never make prolonged eye contact in any of these situations.

Typically, I will glance into their eyes at first, and then look at their eyebrows or glance passed their hear and then back to their eyes, or something similar. 

My question is, do people genuinely make eye contact for the duration of an interaction, whether it be a simple greeting or an entire interview?)"
551,I want to be better but I don’t know how,"It’s been a difficult year for everybody, all of us facing our own issues since lockdown. Man, you probably hear this all the time but I don’t know what to do. I’m sorry for venting but some advice would be appreciated 

I’ve always cared too much what everyone thinks of me including my family, girlfriend and friends so always have bottled up problems. I developed a bad addiction to gambling during lockdown and due to abusing a drug called Xanax which sort of makes you do a lot of stuff without considering consequences. Long story short I’ve put myself in over 15k debt and living payday to payday. I can’t reach out for help because on the outside I am 22 years old with a really well paid job my own mortgage property and I live alone. I actually stopped gambling for a while and got my stuff together for a few months and then as soon as I had my first annual leave since February stuck in lockdown by myself in the house I abused Xanax lost thousands had to take out a short term loan to cover my bills this month, that’s the first time I’ve ever let it go that far. I don’t care about the money so much I will make more and life will go on but i punish myself for screwing up again, I got a knife and kept slicing at my upper leg thigh at anger and I liked it the sting in my leg and the marks remind me of the idiot I’ve been. These aren’t deep cuts either just enough to draw some blood and feel a bit of pain. I did it for the second time today, but I don’t know why because I haven’t gambled in 6 days, well I have no money to gamble but no desire to either. I just feel screwed up in the head I have everything I could ever want a mortgaged house, loving family, beautiful girlfriend, dream job which I’m really good at yet I’m on auto pilot to walk down stairs and slice at my legs for no reason. I am so lucky and  have so much more then everyone I know and they think I am doing great but I’m the unhappiest by far. I don’t know why I can’t reach out for help. I think everyone has enough to deal with right now.

I considered finding someone online I could set up some counselling or something with, I don’t know what to do right now"
552,I can’t focus on anything!,"For my entire life I have always had trouble focusing on really anything. Even writing this out I keep having to pull my mind back because it’s out of control and will wander no matter how hard I try to focus. When I try to do anything whether it’s read, play a video game, talking, eating, sleeping, drawing literally anything my mind will wander and I lose focus on whatever I’m doing and I can’t think straight. Why is this? And it’s only been getting worse and worse, and I’ve noticed it so much more especially these last few months."
553,Why do I always get this feeling that people are testing me.,"In example, I was in online class and my teacher called on me to answer a question, except in my mind I decided that my teacher was secretly asking this question in order to confirm his beliefs that I’m an idiot, and me answering wrong would be his confirmation. I did get the question right but I am an idiot lol. 

Also this can happen in video games, like I could be playing rocket league and the guy on the other team, instead of just playing, is actually testing me to see if I’m good at the game and not just a loser. This might make sense but I think it’s a really weird thought process to believe the guy on the other team isn’t just playing and is actually there to test me, personally. Or I’m just really stupid. 

I do have a shit ton of examples that better explain what I’m experiencing but they get really complex, like, “my friend said this to see if I would do this, so when he does this I won’t do this but at the same time he’s making sure I do this.” 

I believe this has something to do with my dissociation. Anyway if anyone has any suggestions please put them in the comments. thanks :)"
554,What do I tell friends if they ask where I’ve been even when I’m at an inpatient mental health facility?,"I’m planning to admit myself voluntarily to a mental health treatment center in the next coming days. I’ll most likely be away for a couple weeks but I honestly don’t want to tell anyone where I’ve been when I won’t be able to respond to messages/calls and my phone being shut off. I want to just focus on myself and getting better with no distractions and triggers and even though I shouldn’t be ashamed of my mental health, I’m worried my friends will think differently of me. I’m already feeling 1 friend being distant after disclosing my mental health struggles. 

What do I say if they ask where I’ve been?"
555,"This is my death dream, and you are all my death dream characters. I'm sorry to break it to you like this, but 2020 is all my fault.","I killed myself in January of 2017 and everything since then has literally been Hell. I'm sure at least some of you have noticed this.

Just as a warning, though: I very highly doubt that 2021 will be any better. I'm sorry about that, too."
556,Do you ever feel sad for no reason?,"There are times I feel really good and tes really bad. I have means by which I can survie comfortably but there I times I get sad for the slightly inconvenience. At times my anxiety is at peak. Have you experienced this feeling?

557,Am I really improving?,"So I don't really know where to start this, but I am a 20 year old girl who woke up one day and got better. 

I know, no one just wakes up and POOF all of their issues go away, but it really feels like it. About 2 months into being sent home from school due to COVID, I remember waking up and going: why do I give a fuck about half of the things that drive me crazy. Since then it's been like without any effort I've just been improving. 

My anxiety and depression have just subsided to a degree where I can feel normal. I no longer fear texting my friends first, if they are friends with me out of pity or not, if everyone talks shit about me when I leave, or if people make fun of my appearance. I am even to the point where if someone expressed they didn't like me, it would be more their problem than mine. I no longer sit in my room and agonize over what I'm doing wrong or why I have no one close. I still struggle with the motivational aspect of depression, which has always been the most aggressive issue of it for me, but there's no longer an emotion attached to it and it's not nearly as severe as it was before. 

Even my body dysmorphia has seemingly decided to lessen. I will admit that I still see differences in my appearance everyday and have issues with some things, but it's much more normal? I don't sit and cry and stare for hours at what's wrong I just sort of am content about it. When I look drastically different it's not even a thing that makes me break down it's a things where I go ""damn she's new"" and move on with my day. I will say the severity of my disorder has lessened as well and I've come to realize I am much thinner than I thought, and much more attractive. I'm finally allowing myself to wear the clothes I want cause I realized not only can I pull them off, but it doesn't really matter to begin with. All of these years over obsessively worrying and hiding myself away seem so pointless now. It's bizarre to think that at the beginning of 2020 I had developed bulimia for at least 3 months and at the close of 2020 I am better than I ever have been in my life.

I still have things in my life I'd like to change, but in the way that a mentally healthy person would. I still dissociate emotions from certain things in life but it doesn't feel unhealthy to me. I can talk about my childhood trauma and current mental health issues with no emotion linked to it. I did this before but I also used to completely shut down emotionally if I expressed vulnerability in front of others. Now I feel comfortable expressing myself in front of people. I just feel content with life and everyday it seems to get better and better. 

While I love this, I do have the concern about if it's really me deceiving myself for a few months, or if this is really improvement. I've been to all sorts of different therapies in my life and I've felt like none did my any good whatsoever. Up until I was 18 I was strongly considering doing ECT or TMS at the recommendation of the mental health professionals in my life. It all feels so unreal to me. I feel like since I've put seriously zero effort into this new me it seems unlikely to stay. I want so badly to be the person who just wakes up different but is that even possible? 

TLDR: woke up one day and my depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and dissociative tendencies all became so minute I feel like I am almost a completely healthy person."
558,Long post: Should I tell this to my therapist?,"Warning: Slightly vivid description of intense corporal punishment. Read only if you want to.

I've always respected and admired my parents. They have really sacrificed a lot for me and my brother. My mother is emotionally very strong, and her willpower is really strong, she's a supermom, I honestly don't think I can be as capable as her. My dad is a very successful person in a very niche field, very intelligent, multiple degrees, well respected and a sweet dad. Extremely vigilant of both me and my brother, he observes everything. And I mean everything.

So, they've been raised with a belief of spare the rod, spoil the child. I've always been good at my studies and most of it is because of my parents pushing me every single day, even till today. Sometimes I need it, sometimes it is really exhausting. I always maintained a view with my therapist that my parents are not bad people, but were raised a certain way and made some bad choices. They pushed their wishes on me and I'm extremely unhappy with my career despite being successful in it. They pushed me into engineering when I wanted to go to med school. I still am angry at them for that and will probably never forget or forgive even though I want to. 

I did tell my therapist that my parents used corporal punishment when I was little, but never extrapolated on it. I came back home for holidays, and looking at my room all the memories came rushing back in a way. I was never allowed anywhere outside even to a grocery store. I never used public transportation, I never travelled alone anywhere till last year when I moved to the US. My parents always, always dropped me off or sent their driver and their car. Never allowed me to have a boyfriend and slight drop in my grades would mean a huge argument that day with my parents. Sometimes it would extend to them beating me with whatever they found. I want to talk about these beatings most importantly. I still believe they shaped who I am and I still believe maybe they were right to beat me, but I don't want to believe that. Corporal punishment and beating or spanking kids is horrible and I want to hate it, I hate it inside somewhere. 

One time when I was 9 I injured my knees super badly and the innards were visible. I fell down twice by that point on my knees on the same spot. My parents forbid me from going downstairs to play, but being the naive 9 year old that I was, I still went. I fell again on my knees and came back all bloody. My parents scolded me that day, but that wasn't the end of it. The next day, my parents were saying something, but I spoke back twice or thrice and said something bad, something along the lines of who are you to tell me or something like that. My dad was furious and he took a stick, and beat me on my knees, repeatedly. Blood was pouring down, I was scared, I had to pee. My dad stood me in the washroom and gave me 3 seconds. I had no time to take my pajamas off so I peed my pants. He dragged me out again and I was on my knees and beat me on my back, arms and legs. I had welts and bruises all over for a few days. 

Another time, I spoke back something else, and my dad again beat me with a stick of nails. A nail ripped the skin on my arm and I still have a big scar. My parents never approved of me dating, so once in the midnight, I was just editing some photos, and my dad caught me still awake. (I was 17). He snatched my phone away and  demanded to know what I was doing and threatened to read my chats. I had a boyfriend at that time (still do), and I was super scared as it would mean them beating the shit out of me if they found out. So I threatened to kill myself with the kitchen knife and almost cut off two fingers. They gave me my phone back and my dad cried and apologized. My mom had to clean up my blood on the floor and she shouted that it is such a damn pain to clean freaking blood that too in the middle of the night. 

All of these and many more. Corporal punishment was shrugged off almost (mostly because I created the view that it wasn't a big deal) in my therapy. So I just wanted to talk to my therapist about this now. Is all of this serious enough to talk about or will my therapist think it is weird or think I'm exaggerating about the seriousness of all this? Or would he view my parents as monsters? They aren't. I still do love them and I really hold my therapist in high regard. I wouldn't want him to view my parents badly. What do I do? Do I tell him or not?"

560,"How would describe what the experience of brain fog associated with depression is like, to someone who had never experienced such symptoms?","I have such symptoms.

And I'm also keen to know of some meditation/CBT techniques which might be effective in reducing said brain fog?"
561,I’m not sure which part of my judgement I can trust.,"I’ve been struggling with depression for well over 10 years now. Lately, or maybe for a long time without realizing it, I’ve been feeling like people don’t take me serious. F.E. I will say something that’s well thought through, people question everything and dismiss the subject, 15 minutes later a peer says the exact same in different words, and the reaction is like “yeah! That’s great stuff!” And I feel like people actively avoid me, mostly at work. I mean I’m a top tier introvert, and don’t like small talk much, but I’m good at what I do. 

I just don’t know, if I can trust what the little voice is telling me. It makes me even more insecure about speaking my mind, and opening up, making the whole situation worse, because I don’t feel like interacting with said people at all now."
562,Dont know if i am able to be in a relationship atm,I feel like i need a girlfriend to feel like someone love but at the same time i dont want to drag someone in too the hell hole of my menthal health.
563,Not even sure what this categorizes as,"Recently met a guy who I thought was incredible. Dating him for a few months, intelligent, kind, and really there for me.

Showed up with little gifts here and there, helped me get off alcohol dependency, got me into working out, and overall was my greatest support system in my darkest times the past few months.

There were some red flags, he admitted he’s beat all his exes, he has violent tendencies, and he’s cheated on everyone. But that he’s gone through intensive therapy, has a daughter and found hobbies that changed his life. Now he’s trying to volunteer to help kids out.

He was willing to take things slow, and in my experience with abusive people in the past, they want to commit fast and have things locked down right away. 

He didn’t, and I appreciated in this day and age having more of a classic going out on dates and romantkc things and whatnot.

Little by little things got confusing... he told me that he trusted me not to cheat? That if I’m out with my friends he trusts that I’m not doing anything. We’re not in a committed relationship, or so I’d thought. When he was busy, he told me to stay home or see friends.

He kept saying things then like, “I’m glad I’m not who I was 5 years ago, because if you gave me that look then, the first thought in my mind is who the fuck is that bitch think she’s looking at”

It was a bit unsettling but always said with a smile so I brushed it off. And he said he was kidding.

Then he started telling me I’m too nice and deal with my boss’s shit, my friends walking all over me and using me, and my family too. To an extent I believe it, I am working on standing up for myself and I go to therapy.

He made it seem like he cared and on New Years, when my friends called and asked me to get things he told me the wouldn’t take me because he’s sick of seeing me bend over for them.

Yesterday everything blew up. We had a huge date packed with museums and plans, we went out and long story short, I mentioned in a joking way that I was annoyed he kept me waiting for 40 min in the cold. He then quickly dropped my hand and walked faster. When I tried to diffuse and ask what’s wrong, he ignored me and I said “whatever”. He freaked out and told me, “don’t fucking talk to me like that, I don’t talk to you like that.” I did immediately feel bad so I profusely apologized and he ignored me.

After that he gave me the cold shoulder and when I tried to say things, he’d have a mean comment and shut me down.

I took him to my favorite bookstore and while in line just kept trying to make it better.

I told him it’s my favorite place in the world and I didn’t want it to be shared like this.

He flipped out and started cursing and berating me in public - that I “don’t know who the fuck I’m talking to” sometimes, I’m a pussy and so are my friends and I’m “running my mouth saying whatever to him” because I’m not even aware of what he’s capable of. Or who he is.

I ended up crying and begging for his forgiveness which I feel super pathetic about now. In the end he yelled at me to make up a decision on what to do. I said I wanted it to go back to normal and he said then get in the store, so we’re not in the cold. He ran off in the store and I got some books and found him

When I tried apologizing again he freaked out and said essentially it’s funny how I disrespect him, but not my male best friends who make fun of me. Which, they apologized to me after For. He asked how I’m scared of them and not him.

I tried to make it better and we went to some other places. We ended up eating at a restaurant where... 

When I kept trying to say something to make conversation, he would shut me down and make me feel like an idiot. I get kind of, this isn’t PC but as my friends say, act “almost autistic” and just shut down and can’t talk when I feel cornered. So he kept telling me to speak and I couldn’t. 

I told him I felt he’s being mean. He slammed the table and the drink fell, spilled all over me and he walked out. 

When I tried to pay, he came back and said he would - and when I held his arm to say no it’s ok since he paid for everything else, he told me to “back the fuck off” so I left.

Once I went to the subway station he texted me demanding where I was... and I left my books there. I ended up telling him and he was in tears, so I ended up apologizing and then forgiving him because he asked what I felt and I said I have nothing to say except I’m really sad. He said he’s sorry for making me probably feel like he bullied me and made me sad.

Long story short I forgave him and we had dinner, but I feel nervous about it all. He’s been going through a lot with his parents and I do empathize with him - he’s normally not like this. In the car he did say something that scared me a bit - that that wasn’t even mad, it was just annoyed, and he hopes I never see him mad, because he would “fucking kill you”. And I said I hope it’s not directed toward me, he always says I’m so small he can’t be mad at me, but I feel kind of nervous about it

But I just want to say I’m really fucking tired of being called too nice, a pussy and just exhausted of living at this point. That’s my rant.

TLDR I’m pathetic."
564,Smoking to help with mental health?,"Hi guys, first time posting here. I just wanted to get some other thoughts on some issues I have going on.

Male/28

I have had depression since my early teens. Several meds made me contemplate (but never attempt) suicide. Decided never to try them again because the older I get the easier it would become.

The day after I turned 18 I bought me a pipe, and have been a casual pipe smoker for the last ten years (pipe tobacco, smoking peter stokkebyes luxury navy flake as I type this). It was almost medative, way cheaper than cigarettes and cigars would have been, and since I randomly get bored with it and occasionally go months without smoking I assume I am not physically addicted.

In my early 20's I found out I have alot of genetic problems. I've had 3 strokes since I was 24 (blood sugar spiked to almost 1,200 because my liver went ape shit, before was running about 95-115). Not a heavy drinker at all. Was given six months to live. Lost a few months memory, permanent muscle damage, had to learn to walk and talk again. Keep on keeping on am I right?

Anyway, I've found when I'm not smoking (as in months long breaks) I wind up getting depressed, which makes me eat way more (and higher carb foods which seriously messes with my blood sugar despite insulin).

My family doesnt like me smoking because ""it isn't good for you"". My thoughts are higher blood sugar and stress/depression will get me far quicker than any worries about cancer. 

I get it's not physically good for me,but there's far worse I could be doing. I know people can't say ""oh yeah keep doing it"" without  saying it isn't healthy.  I just feel it's a lesser of two evils type deal. I feel like I might not even be here at this point if I wasn't destressing when smoking. I get for most people my age it wouldn't be recommended, but going by drs I shoulda died a few years ago.

Am I way off base on this one, or am I atleast somewhat justified in doing what helps me mentally untill the end?"
565,Bad health anxiety. Need help to manage. Mentally exhausted.,"I can feel several lymph nodes in my neck and not sick: is that normal ?


Hello everyone. First time posting here. I am 18. My health anxiety has reached a peak. I have two lymph nodes that I can feel, one on each side of my jaw. It’s been a while I can feel them though and thought it was normal until I googled it and realised it wasn’t. I always have a high temperature (37.5/37.7 rectally) and wondered if it was normal. Since I now have a new one, it freaked me out. Blood test 2 weeks ago showed no infection and the fear is literally paralising me. I live in a rural area and my parents will not take me to the doctor, telling me that I am crazy. A few days ago I was sneezing etc, maybe I got a cold which explains the new ones but I somehow don’t believe it because I got a blood test that showed no infection. I am so scared, I don’t want to die. The 2 on each side are around the size of an Olive (between a pea and an olive). I should have never looked on google in the first place but now I need help to get over it. 
I need help. I can’t help but think it’s too late. My blood test came back clean so no infection. Dr Google convinced me that lymphoma is the only other explanation.

I started touching my neck everywhere and found 2 symmetrical hard things that are probably muscles but a bit round so I freaked. I started palpating everywhere and get convinced it’s a lymph node all the time. I am mentally exhausted, I need help on how to manage the anxiety. My psychologist is returning on the 12th only but I can’t take it until that. Please help. In away, or advice."

567,"Thinking of doing violent and disturbing things, what should I do?","My mental health (which was doing extremely well) rapidly declined from the start of quarantine on. I had to move back in with my parents and can count my happy days since march on one hand. I feel like this has made me become mad, as at first I felt like I was physically and mentally slowly deteriorating. I have ADHD and tend to get sad when my mind is not stimulated, and I can‘t muster up the energy to entertain myself when I‘m this sad. But now I‘m seriously starting to get pissed off by this spiral and have developed a tendency to think horrible stuff.
I think a lot about various ways of self harming and have picked it up again even though I have stayed mostly clean for five years, I sometimes just want to piss or vomit on the ground just to do something disgusting, I think of buying something expensive to ruin my finances, killing the pets, stabbing my parents or running away. I regularly cry myself to sleep and pray that I‘m not going to wake up anymore and imagine how peaceful death will be. Last summer, I took a bunch of medication in an haphazard attempt to commit suicide, but I knew it wouldn‘t work while doing it, so I don‘t really know if I‘m even really suicidal or just a despicable and annoying attention-seeker. 
I don‘t know what to do. I don‘t know how long it will take me until I actually do what I‘m thinking of, or if I will ever do it. I‘m also positive that my mental health will get better after quarantine ends, but there‘s no end in sight and I can‘t trust that I‘ll last until whenever that will be. I‘m mostly just terrified of myself and don‘t want to live like this anymore."
568,"A friend of mine's mental health is going very bad again because of his psychological abusive mother, but I dont know how and if I can help him","(long post) 

Hi, my friend (22 male, we are friends since we were 10 or so, he's practically family to me) had problems such as severe depression, panick attacks, inability to speak to strangers and frequent dissociation episodes since he was 14 or so up until 3 years ago when he moved out from his parent's, started therapy and started taking meds. 

In less than 2 years he became boyfriend with a mutual friend of us, started university with max grades, and after that he was ok, he even dropped meds and was fine for months.

Unfortunately, in March, rent prices went up in our country so he had to leave his room in the city where he was studying and move back to his parents' in our birthtown.

Since then things started going very bad. His mother has some kind of mental health issue, since she literally yells all the time, is overly aggressive, manipulating and controlling. His father is a silent men, probably depressed too, who doesn't do anything except working.

In a few months my friend reverted to his original state. He can't move out because he's got no money and he's in no condition to work (also coronavirus doesn't help). 

He can't talk to a psychologist because he's got no money and his parents don't acknowledge the problems, when he was in therapy, he tried 2 times to get his parents to partecipate and it resulted in them going there and then punishing my friend with verbal aggression from which he's incapable of defending.

He says he can't get therapy in his birthtown because his mother will send him to a friend of hers who justifies his mother in any way (this already happened) and he hasn't got a choiche because it's not his money. Also the town is very small so he's not got much coiche. 

He said that he tried many times to talk to his parents, and he can't get anyone to talk to them for him because his mother doesn't respect nobody's opinions and will just aggro on him and punish him afterwards. I can't even talk to nobody about this because he's afraid his mother will know.

He can't find a room at a low price and he says that when he starts looking for it the frustration for the high price is so hard that he can't go on (he's depressed), also I think he's afraid of asking money to his parents. I offered him to look toghether online while neing toghether on a skype call but he always finds a way to ignore this offer, I think he's either too scared or too depressed. 

My friend is a brilliant person and it is awful that he has to be in this situation. He text me often telling me of things that happen and that he's suffering and anything he'll do will make it worse. 

I don' t know what to do, and if I can do anything at all. My room is really too small or I would ask him to move in. 
What should I do? I thought about finding him a very cheap room, but it's a very long work and I'm afraid he won't take a room anyway if I find it for him (too afraid to ask money).
I could talk to his girlfriend since she's a very good friend of mine but she already knows the situation, and anyway, what would that do? Also I don't think my friend would like that."

570,The Skeleton Key of Life PT 3,"If I said to you right now, how are you feeling, are you happy?...how would you respond? Ignoring the nice new trainers/clothes, fancy phone/bike. Not sure what I mean? Our happiness depends on the habit of mind we cultivate. Cultivate your heart and develop the happiness habit, mindset and then life, will become a continual feast. Happy people are not their own enemies, they do not carry on an endless war with their souls. We may be fiercely at odds with the wrongs of the world around us. But inside ourselves if we are happy, we are at peace. It isn’t what you have, who you are, where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about, until you are happy with who you are, you will never be happy with what you have. No easy task of course but you can take each moment of every day to prepare and be your teacher of happiness. You deserve peace, love, happiness and all that your heart desires. Don’t let anyone control your life and take away those things. Happiness is a state of mind that comes from your thoughts from within you. In light of this, HEAL. WE NEVER STOP HEALING. We’re constantly experiencing new things in life. During this isolated time, I’ve become very grounded with working on my mental state overall. Defining what emotions I go through, why I feel like this, what I can do to counter this. Some unwanted emotions have crept up and something as simple as drawing/writing down these moments of despair and confusion, has helped. I’ve been making a bundle of solutions and outcomes around it, trying to get to the root of each individual error. How you define your own happiness is entirely your own doing. But please, practice happy thinking every day. Compliment yourself, love yourself and others around you more than ever. We’re all going to come out of this pandemic stronger than ever before. Way more connected, determined and grateful for what we truly have and gain from life."
571,The Skeleton Key of Life PT 5,"I know you’re in pain. I know things are hard. However, we must continue the fight and get stronger. Our own battles come in many shapes, forms and sizes. So be nicer to one another. Though, we must not forget to be kind and reward ourselves. Many of us often forget how important self care is. Try complimenting yourself and accept the nice things people say instead of brushing them off. You’re worth everything, you deserve everything you’re fighting for. Wether you use the power of religion, self confidence or other, let that self confidence and strong mentality explode through your mind and body. Life’s about experiences, challenges and learning, start by coming out of your shell and making way for new journeys.

You’ll have bad days, moments of despair...But you are being true to yourself. You are being who you want to be. Enjoying the life you live, is ever so important. Take the steps, walk the path, get out there. There’s a world full of potential and hope out there. No one deserves to suffer. No one deserves to be alone. The world can be cruel and sadistic. However we can make life so much more better and beautiful. Treat people how you wish to be treated, don’t give up on hope and faith. Stay true to yourself. Finally, don’t be ashamed of sharing your struggle. Others could help you or themselves by hearing/seeing your story. People act in funny ways but we all need that spark and motive to keep on going.

572,The Skeleton Key of Life PT 6,"Anxiety isn't a choice. If people knew how badly those affected wish they could be like everybody else, and how hard it is to be affected by something that can bring them to their knees every single day. It's no joke, anxiety literally leaves you either frozen on the spot/so restless you just cannot focus. Tackling anxiety in young and old, is something we all need a better understanding in. How to notice the signs, how to help each other, what to do when someone is having an anxiety attack. Firstly, remember to breathe. Secondly, try and notice your surroundings/where you are. Sit down/grab something, anything to keep yourself at bay of where you are right now. Keep breathing and if it helps/you can, TALK to someone. Just having that familiar voice there, can really calm a person. As you start to calm down, get some water. Cry if you have too. Don't be ashamed of letting go of the fear/paranoia you've just experienced. Together, we're gonna get you through this. You're in control, slowly but surely, we're gonna get you out of this. After the attack has been and gone, relax. You may feel fatigued, run-down, more vulnerable then usual. Put some music on, read a book, watch something you love. These attacks/feelings of fear, self loathing, panic are a very common part of an anxiety bound person. If you are suffering, try these steps. You'll be in control and can get back to enjoying your lives the way you should. Said it once and I'll say it again...my inbox is always open. I don't judge, I don't mock, if you need help...reach out. Hope you're all having a blessed Sunday X"
573,The Skeleton Key of Life PT 7 (Final),"The power of the word YES, is second to none. You can start by saying yes right now. Wake up and say yes, I’m going to hit the gym. Say yes to how amazing you are each day. Say yes to a upcoming work/uni/college/school project, that is out of your comfort zone and blow it out of the water. Say yes to trying something new and surprise yourself with your new found passion/experience. Say yes to staying at home with a good book/binging your favourite movie/tv series. You are important, self care is vital in our time on this planet. Mostly, say yes to having the biggest life possible. Because your happiness will create happiness in others and bring out a endless amount of experiences/new journeys your way. Overtime, your willingness and expertise will shine off you. Others will thrive to just be around you, life will genuinely feel better. When you understand the power of yes, you can achieve anything. Don’t tell yourself you can’t date that person, get that promotion, get that grade on your test. Just say YES and start to open your life. By taking baby steps at a time, you can accomplish a goal. Now is the time to get what you lust for and desire. Start today, right now, this minute even. You never know what will get thrown your way.

There are several mechanism of action, which are briefly:

1. Endogenous opioid release, such as β-endorphin, after skin puncture
2. Blood pressure reduction due to removal of excess blood iron
3. Reduction in cerebrospinal fluid, due to blood pressure reduction

Due to the reasons listed above, I see that professional therapies like

* Cupping therapy and al-hijamah therapy
* Acupuncture therapy
* Bloodletting and blood donating

should be seeked instead of dangerous home self help methods, which can lead to permanent damage and death.

The question of ""what is self-harm?"" is in some sense subjective  and cultural question, because through ages people who didn't have  access to the modern scientific knowledge just did thinks as they show  helpful, and in many cases bloodletting developed in every culture as a  form of primitive medicine so it could be argued that, from the  anthropomorphic perspective, young people who self-harm by cutting  today, are just rediscovering the ancient medicine of bloodletting.

Due to following reasoning:

&gt;Bloodletting  will reduce the iron stores of the body, which will lowers blood  pressure \[source 8\], hence lowering intracranial pressure \[source 9\].

it can be reasoned that

1. bloodletting might also help with ocular palsy, under which dyslexia can be categorized.
2. because  intracranial pressure is pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid, which  fills parts of the cranium and spinal cord, it can be reasoned that some  back pain might be caused by high pressure in cerebrospinal fluid, and  hence lowering blood pressure might alleviate these types of black  pains."
575,Can someone help me get my anxiety under control,"So i my anxiety is a lot better than it was last yr, however i really want to fix something because it stops me enjoying what i like to do. When i watch something on tv that im excited about i get very anxious and worry that something will ruin the moment and so i just end up ruining it and feel like i have missed out in that experience. This may not seem like a big deal but it is to me because i rely on this to keep me sane and happy as i don’t really have many friends who chat to me. Any help i will be so grateful for thank u."
576,Feeling overwhelmed looking for a psych?,"Hi all, new here. It's been overdue for a looong time, but I'm currently looking into getting psychiatric help with plans to call around tomorrow. My issue right now is anytime I try to research, I get so overwhelmed and worried about how expensive it will be or if they'll even accept me etcetc. I don't currently have a set primary care doc, so getting a reference if needed may be difficult as well. Another thing I'm interested in, if possible, is finding one I can do appointments with over the phone. I have bad driving anxiety and live in the middle of no where so the closest mental health place is about 30-45 minutes away. I'll deal with it if I have to but I really hope once I get the help a lot of this alleviates, even just a little bit. 

How did you all manage to find one and have any of you had luck with over the phone counselling/psychiatrists? I'm also paranoid about accidentally trying someone who isn't credible if I go the over-the-phone route as I see a lot of advertisement-like sites that don't seem too legit. Should I suck it up and try to find one in person and just drive the extra way. Sorry, I tend to overthink everything so this probably sounds really dumb. 

Thank you all in advance!

TL;DR Looking into finding a psychiatrist but searching makes me feel overwhelming. Looking for advice on how to find one, ideally over-the-phone or to just get over that overwhelming feeling while looking. Also don't have a primary care doctor for referrals."
577,Friend losing friends,"Dear all,  


this what I am about to post is a long story but quite serious. I changed the names just for privacy reasons. So Lillie and me ""are"" both friends of Kevin.  


**First part**  


However, about a month ago, Kevin got offended when Lillie sent him a message (see below). Basically, Lillie sent Kevin a scan of her baby with its mouth open and a text ""mouth open"" (the same text and photo was send to two other friends who did not get offended (me and someone else)). However, Kevin took it personally and since then his behaviour towards Lillie has been anything but nice. The outcome: He does not want to be in contact with her, even though she tried to explain that this was no offence to criticize his mouth. What can be done here? Explanations did not work.  


**Conversation between Lillie and Kevin**  
\[06/12/2020, 21:15\] Lillie: Thing is I don't want to speak just to be shouted at. I don't have the energy or inclination right now. So if you could change your tone somewhat then fine we can speak  
\[06/12/2020, 21:16\] Kevin: Same to you. You have not even apologised for offending me with that mouth crap  
\[06/12/2020, 21:16\] Kevin: When I said 'that's not nice' that was clear enough  
\[06/12/2020, 21:16\] Lillie: There was no offence implied  
\[06/12/2020, 21:17\] Kevin: And yet it was caused. There was no offence implied by not being available at the time you wanted me  
\[06/12/2020, 21:17\] Lillie: I'm sorry you felt that way  
\[06/12/2020, 21:17\] Kevin: And I'm sorry you feel this way  
\[06/12/2020, 21:18\] Lillie: Thanks  
\[06/12/2020, 21:19\] Lillie: But do we need to apologize for every historical joke we make? You do it about my belly, my toes etc. And I don't demand an apology because I know you do it in jest, as I know I do with you  
\[06/12/2020, 21:19\] Lillie: As \* you know I do  
\[06/12/2020, 21:22\] Kevin: No but sometimes it's too much and if the other indicates we could stop  
\[06/12/2020, 21:23\] Kevin: I'm sorry if I have historically gone too far  
\[06/12/2020, 21:23\] Lillie: I don't take offence though  
\[06/12/2020, 21:23\] Lillie: I know you're joking  
\[06/12/2020, 21:23\] Kevin: Yes but sometimes I do take offence. We are different like that  
\[06/12/2020, 21:24\] Lillie: And does it really matter if you think my belly is too big or my toes are too long? Does it matter if I think your mouth is too big or your ear is too small?  
\[06/12/2020, 21:24\] Lillie: I don't think so  


Something else that is very important to mention. Kevin is a middle-aged grown adult who works part-time. So he has got a lot of free-time (50%)- which he fills with ""spiritual"" New-Age-(nonesense). This has, especially in the past few months changed his behaviour to the negative side.  


**Second part**  
He is also about to lose me ...  


First of all, he thinks he is a prophet. He has always been into spiritual stuff but recently it has been quite extreme. He also watches new age videos such as Magenta Pixie and believes in the Enneagram for which he received daily e-mails. He also thinks he can influence energetic vibrations to lead humanity, activate Stargates etc. In addition, he wants to be like Jesus.  


He does not take drugs but drinks about four beer of alcohol every day in the evening which has become that bad due to Corona and is kind of a habit now - he is definitely not coping well.  


So last time I visited, the weekend before Christmas, we had a total fallout. I stayed at his flat for a few days. There he has been treating me really bad (hostile) which I would pretty much consider it bullying. Complaining about things, criticizing etc. Even his housemate said that she had never seen that side of him. (She also wants to move out asap as she does not feel comfortable. She gets random criticisms and feels a bit stressed in the flatshare).  


To name a few examples:  


*- I once dropped a bit of chocolate ice cream on his pillow on the sofa. I said ""ups"" and got up in order to clean it in the bathroom. He freaked out ... When I wanted to slice the tomato, he told me I was using the wrong knife (I should have used the sharper one ...). I do not know his knives, however, the knife I used was fine. For sure I was angry about it and stopped talking for a bit.*

  
*- When I was at his flat: Even though we settled on what to cook earlier in the day; he decided not to participate in the cooking process when we wanted to do it, as he just ""did not feel like it"", however, behind my back he criticized my potatoes and called them ""sh\*\*"" (I rarely hear him use such words, usually never) but this is what he told the housemate.*

  
*- Understandably, I was in a withdrawn and not energetic mood once is hostile behaviour towards me started - however, he was able to switch from a ""not okay"" mood to a ""let's have fun"" mood and this was just irritating and seemed insane.*

  
*- Once he put on the Magenta Pixie video on TV which he wanted to show us, he started criticizing my attitude, how I was not opening up. He was praising the housemate for being interested as she was making noises like ""aha"" (though (I later talked to her) this noise was just made as she knows he does not like criticism - so he interpreted her ""confirmation"" totally wrong).*

  
*- Also which I am very worried about. He has a ""friend"", which he did not like much in the past when he was still more normal. Now that she is into that spiritual stuff; he enjoys talking to her. She claims that she can talk to/communicate with trees and he believes her! I think she is a bad influence and just a ""support"" for his mental instability.*

  
*- He told me he has never felt more clear in his head.*

  
*- On the train he was asking me why I was so negative all the time; I told him it was due to his constant bullying behaviour towards me this weekend. He then replied that this was not true, he was referring to my general energetic pattern ... I never gave him the answer which he wanted as there was not such one. He did not like that.*

  
*- He always compares me and other friends to the enneagram descriptions. He gets his daily mails. I feel like he does not see me as an individual anymore but always tries to find truth in the enneagram. Furthermore, he (so we think) adjusts his behaviour unconsciously to that of what the enneagram says. According to the enneagram, he thinks he is the Reformer (type one) - perfectionism and tries to be as perfect ... which he is not .*..

  
*- He once promised me (already two years ago) to show me his university photos. He never did. When his housemate was there he got them out, showed them to her, asked me briefly whether I wanted to see them. I was saying ""yes"" but more quietly. Then he said: If you are not energetic for it, then you shouldn't (He had already criticized me a lot at this point). At the same time, I was angry and I thought, why would you show them to her ""now"" and not me in the past. You have known me for much longer.*

  
In the end, I suggested a contact pause (Here I called an anti-cult-organization and they told me to do it that way to take control which Lillie did not do, so maybe he thinks he as more control about their friendship?). This I think it is very important as it is usually him who suggests that. Basically, I have taken away control. About a week later I received a message from him:  


\[13:19, 2.1.2021\] Kevin: Hi,  
Happy New Year. I tried messaging the other day but seemed to have been blocked (again). Kann das sein? \*(translation:Can that be?)  
\[13:22, 2.1.2021\] Kevin: See it's getting through this time so I'll start by saying sorry that my (at times severe) impatience and frustration caused me to be harsh with you  


\*\*\*\*  


I think he just sent me the message to take back control and to feel better about himself. But I do not think he takes it seriously. The way he phrased his message is not an apology. Words such as ""impatience"" and ""frustration"" indicate that I obviously triggered his behaviour.  


Lillie and I think he has got control issues, possibly suffers from paranoia and narcissism.  


**What can she do to get back into contact with him as he is not insightful and not willing to talk? He hasn't even apologized.**  
He used to be a good friend to both of us but his behaviour is out of control right now.  
Also, what do you think about the situation and can be done?"
578,I (25 F) just need someone to talk to about this. I’m feeling very alone with these thoughts.,"Recently I’ve been finding myself stuck on the fact that nothing matters. I’m atheist and fully believe there’s no purpose to the universe and we all die and it will all be pointless; my life and all of the future lives to come. I tried going about it with the mindset of “Awesome! That means I can do whatever makes me happy and not worry about how it will affect my tombstone or the way I’m viewed when I’m gone!” but that is no longer the case. Now I’m just dead inside, nothing makes me happy, I have no interests or motivation. I’m just existing, for what feels like nothing. I wrote this down earlier and realized I need help like ASAP: 

(PS- no worries, I’m also seeking professional help)

“Nothing feels real anymore. Or did it ever? The creation of our world and what was here before is unfathomable and overwhelming and almost debilitating. What are we doing here? I don’t think there is any purpose to any of it so what is the point? To be happy? Why, when we will all just die one day? Do we even really die? This feels like a simulation in which we simply just go offline. As narcissistic as this may sound, sometimes it feels like everything and everyone was created simply for the purpose of my narrative... Nothing actually exist outside of me, the computer. Like, the way I can talk myself into believing anything that will best benefit the happiness of the system that runs me, and then that’s just the way it is. We will never know the truth… Does a person really feel that way or do they feel nothing at all because they are just a robot in my simulation? I don’t want to wake up because then there really will be nothing to live for.

Fucking Matrix and West World, man.”"
579,17F need advice badly,"I've been severely depressed since 6th grade. I have been in and out of hospitals, Outpatient programs, etc. I have been on 10ish medications over time and am currently on 2. The problem is nothing is helping me, I am constantly suicidal and have absolutely no motivation to do school work. I have programs in school because of my mental health, but if I am genuinely doing no work it makes no difference. I have tried everything. I have been to different psychiatrists and therapists, genetic testing, hormone levels, etc. I am going to fail out of high school. I feel backed into a corner, and my mental health has never been worse. Everyone knows how badly I am depressed, but no one has any answers. Not even my therapist. Nothing is changing, nothing is getting better, there is no sign of relief in my future. Any bit of advice would be very helpful, I don't see how I am going to make it out of high school."
580,SUSHI MUKBANG: Body Issues &amp; Eating Disorders in Desi Culture,"Eating Disorders and Body Dysmorphia are topics for conversations we have to normalize more often. There are more people struggling with this than we know, and it is important to dismantle the stigma."
581,Does anyone else have that living for the next thing mentality?,"I don't know if this actually makes sense to anyone else, but I basically always have this mentality of hanging on for the next thing and the next thing and so on. This just mean that I'm always living for something and when that comes around I have to find a new thing.   
This is where some problems arise. I was living for Christmas and then New Years but now I'm just in a zone where there is no next thing to look to. If its too far away it doesn't work and I just can't find anything. This leaves me feeling like I have no purpose and nothing to actually go for. What do you do when you're in this situation? What other things can you keep going for?"
582,Filled with hate...,"I came from an impoverished country to the west, I saw lots of misery, the collapse of society, etc... it was hard on itself due to the sheer poverty; yet I lifted myself, with nothing but hard work.

Yet I just found a world of people who agreed with the communists and spew the same ideas, or had otherwise similar twisted ideas of nationalism, and institutions too, which actively tried to hurt me, legal proof in hand. The amount of hate I have, is, something you won't understand.

I honestly don't give a damn, all I want is to hurt them, these institutions, governments and business; I try to come with methods to make workers unemployable, and make them obsolete; to prove their methods are inferior to what even a ""uneducated"" (as they have legally described me) can come with; maybe I can make a dent. Maybe I can change things, maybe, and save myself and my family."
583,Left behind,"I have abandonment issues. Unless I know someone is coming back I have a mental breakdown. My aunt, uncle and cousin all left without a set time that they would return...I’m breaking down from this, even though I’m staying in their house. I just feel like a burden or like I’m unwanted.  Is there any place I can go to get help, like online or something because I am aware I need professional help, bad. I have trouble existing again. Any help would be great."
584,I might need help helping,"My wife is trying to start therapy this year and I’d like to help. Most of the therapists in are area don’t take are insurance. Despite this she hasn’t officially started seeing anyone right now but has an interview next week.

Once she starts going regularly is there anything I can do on my end to help her? Should I keep in contact with her therapists so I can know what I should do/don’t do? I know my wife wants help but I don’t know is she feels I should be involved."
585,The day I got mentally ill,"Of course there was a lot happening before and after... but my acute mental illness hit me like a fucking truck. For the first time in my life I felt this acute hopelessness. Agonizing pain. Suicidal thoughts. Painful emptiness.

11 years later.

I still feel the same feeling.

AFTER medication, countless different therapies, inpatient stays, moving, working out, becoming vegan, hanging out with friends regularly, meditation... jesus fucking christ, I even went for the pschedelic self-therapy route!! I TRIED IT ALL!!!! I CAN'T EVEN FIND ANYTHING NEW THAT I HAVEN'T TRIED ANYMORE!!

I think I'm just meant to die, honestly! What is this suffering? Why?? I CAN'T LIVE WITH IT. I CAN'T FUNCTION WITH IT. I CAN'T DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!"
586,Possible OCD?,"For the past 4/5 years I have been dealing with a delusion (I think that’s the best word for it) that I will be the cause of someone’s death. Three times before, I have gotten a heavy intuitive feeling that someone will die and that feeling has always been accompanied by somebody’s death (always someone in my family). I have somehow drawn the conclusion that I have unknowingly caused their death. 

The feeling is back yet again and I don’t know how to cope with it. I genuinely cannot tell if it is just some sort of intuitive sixth sense or if it’s just some awful coincidence. 

I’m also debating if I should consider OCD a possibility or not as I do have other ‘compulsive’ behaviors like grabbing items like napkins in multiples of 3, having a specific way to open my bathroom cabinets while i brush my teeth and wash my face, and another “delusion” of maggots burrowing in my feet which leads me to have to constantly cover my feet."
587,My boyfriend is currently in hospital after an overdose,"Trigger warning: suicide, self harm 

My partner is currently in hospital after a suicide attempt (codydramol overdose). If this hospital visit is anything like the last 5, he'll be home by midnight. No matter what he has to suffer through with regards to his mental health, doctors turn him away. No one gives him the help he actually needs, they just slap him on another antidepressant instead of trying to diagnose the actual problem. We suspect he has undiagnosed bipolar 2.

What can I do to make doctors take him seriously and help him? He needs proper medication and therapy, not being told to go home and take a hot bath. Hot baths don't fix mental illness."
588,Does anyone have any advice on how to navigate these feelings?,
589,I feel like no one wants me in their life.,"I have all of these people who I thought were my friends, but then once quarantine started they just cut contact. None of them ever even talk to me any more unless I text them first, and even then they end the conversations quickly. I’ll try and set things up with them, and they’ll make plans even after saying they can make it. I just feel like no one cares enough about me to want me in their life, and the people I thought were my friends don’t think of me the same way. I just want someone to care about me."
590,Tw/cw self harm,"I haven't self harmed in maybe 2 or 3 months now and the last time I did it was really bad, like I just went crazy with it and now have some really bad scars. That last time I had self harmed was after a few months of not hurting myself, as well.

I feel like it's just constantly building up inside me and I don't know how to handle it. I hate myself so much and I want to tear myself apart because of it. Everything has just gotten worse since my last episode, I look and feel so awful. 

Lately I mostly just play video games to distract myself but it's starting to make me feel weird and bad but living my life irl is just as bad. I have no idea what to do, I feel like self harm would alleviate it at this point even though I know that isn't true."

I'm trying to connect past experiences of mental health care with present ones to form a more cohesive picture of psychiatric care. I've been in psych wards before, but I want to hear from others.

593,I keep on getting anxiety and weird feelings about hs,"These last few months have been very tough for me. Everyday I was doing work and I didn’t have any friends to talk to because of Covid. During last semester’s finals, I kept on feeling worried and scared and I kept on crying. Even over this winter break, I felt sad and wasn’t happy. I cried last night and right now I’m scared of going back to school because of all the work and the loneliness I might face. During the first semester, I would wake up early at 5 and would have to work on schoolwork until late at night. I think sitting in the same chair everyday doing work without having any friends is what is causing all these problems, and I don’t know how to solve it. I think it’s really starting to affect my mental health now but I don’t know if it’s that serious or not. Please help me."
594,Feeling down when someone is not replying,"How do you cope when someone you care about doesn't feel like talking? My friend is not doing well recently, especially physically which is also affecting her mental health. She's tired most of the time so she usually is trying to sleep.
I message her each day but she doesn't usually reply and rarely reads my messages. When she occasionally replies it's not a conversation, just a passing comment. We've not properly talked for 2 weeks.
I'm doing all I can try be there for her, which she understands, and I know I have to be patient but I'm struggling not being able to do more and not knowing how she's doing.

Just in case it's relevant, we're planning to start a relationship at some point. Right now she's not ready for that though, as she needs to focus on herself, but she expects to feel differently in the future."
595,I fucking hate my social anxiety [F19],"It just makes my life so much worse. Ever since middle school I had a hard time talking to people  especially when I’m not sure if those people liked me or not.
During covid it got just so much worse I spend my time inside my room by myself sometimes not talking to anyone for days except my sister and mum. I started getting better till the end of high school which I graduated last year. In senior year I had a lot of fun with people and got better at talking.
Because I couldn’t spend New Year’s Eve with my friends I got drunk with my sister and enjoyed some time together. Later that night I decided to join a public discord to talk to some people because I was feeling very lonely. This was my second time talking in a public discord. The first time some friends of mine and I joined to play among us. I was the only girl in the vc and I believe my heart nearly jumped out my chest because I was so anxious, I also didn’t talk a lot.
At new year’s I actually had a lot of fun talking to people. I would like to do it again but I’m just way to fucking scared."
596,"Finally social, but things are getting to me - worried about my mental health","All my life I have been an outcast. 2020 was actually the year in which things got better for me, from a social point of view - I became the most popular guy in my uni class and became very good at socializing. I made lots of friends, especially with this one girl (I'll call her Susan for the purpose of this story) with which I open up a lot and she's the best friend I could have ever wished for. Right before Christmas, I also went out with this girl (I'll call her Rosie) and we connected a lot, so much that I think we may end up together.

But alas, Covid. Face-to-face classes were canceled. 90% of our time is spent in our rooms. My flight home got canceled, so I had to spend Christmas away from my family. Covid also forced Rosie to stay home more than planned, and likely I won't be able to see her until mid-to-late January. I want also to hang out with my friend Susan, but I also won't be able to see her for a couple more days.

The worse thing is, I keep overthinking about Rosie. I worry 24/7 that she might be seeing someone else or that she may lose interest in me in the meantime. I keep re-reading our texts over and over again. I worry so much that I can't focus on my work and it's really taking a toll on my mental health.

I think the reason for this is that I never had a close friend or a girlfriend before in my life, and I crave being able to connect with Susan and Rosie more. But I can't for now and I don't know what to do. Whenever I sit down at my desk I get sad and I want to cry - I want to build a connection with people but I can't. Most of the people at my uni are home right now and Covid restrictions make it very difficult for me to find social activities.

So I'm thinking about going to therapy. In the meantime, does any of you have any idea of what I can do to improve my mental health? Anyone who was in a similar situation but managed to overcome it? How do I let go of this stuff and focus on studying before my academic performance plummets?

Thank you."
597,Anyone have an alternative to Youper for Android?,"I have depression and ADHD, and I want to be able to track when my depressive episodes start and when I get weird emotional flashes (especially anger), but Youper, on top of needing a subscription (which I was able to avoid by being grandfathered in, if that gives you an idea of how long I'd been using it) is no longer on Android, and I can't reinstall it since I got a new phone. Does anyone have any ideas for good alternatives that aren't like, obscenely expensive and do the same thing of letting you track mood on a regular basis?"

599,Brain fog. Block in mental cognition,"So I've been dealing with periodical brain fog, I think brought on by bouts of anxiety and depression. That aside I'm trying to find out if anyone else's experience of it is similar to mine. If I had to describe it, its like you mind is a waterjug and when you're in brain fog mode that jug is completely full and water just cascades over when you try to add more. I find it extremely difficult to concentrate on anything and I get these overwhelming urges to sleep/shut down. Another odd thing is memory recall is practically zero. I cant recall past experiences and can only react to the present moment situation. This is very difficult when trying to do anything remotely creative because you loose your imaginative faculties. I was curious to see if anyones elses experience matches mine and how to they cope with it?"

I did space out the pills a few days hoping that would help until I finally called. I don't know why I didn't just call. I felt a little off Thursday but ignored it and drank way too much for NYE. Thought I just had a normal hangover but then instead of getting better it got worse and worse. I also get migraines so at firt I figured it triggered that, then it occured to me it was likely also to do with going off the venlafaxine. there's nothing I can do until tomorrow when I just hope they will be understanding enough to give me something to hold me over until  they can get me in if that's weven  all that's causing it I don't know but I have never felt so awful in my entire life. All I've done is sleep. It's taking eeverything I have to type this I will probably throw up afterward. I'm dizzy and can barely walk to the bathroom. I have the most excruiciating migraine I've ever had, nonstop since Friday. I feel like I can barely take it. Nothing at all helps even a little bit. I found a high dose ibuprofen from some accident and it did nothing. Sleeping pills give me such insane dreams that I wake up feeling even worse than I did before. I feel like I need to eat and then feel horribly sick as soon as I do. I only want to sleep  but am somtimes in so much pain or have so much nausea and these bizarre waves of something in my head I can't even describe. I can't have the tv on or the light or music or anything I'm just laying here for hours and hours and my eyes hurt from being pushed into the pillow too long. I feel so scared and hopeless and so guilty for being such an idiot and doing this to myself and so afraid that I still won't feel better when I get the venlafaxine. How long will it even take to work if it is that?

Please if anyone has exxperience with this please comment or tell me anything that might help me get throiugh this I can't stop crying and it's only making it even worse I don't know what to do I'm scared but I don't want to scare my husband typing this while he's at the store thank you"
601,I weighted my self today and I wish I didn’t,Hey..28yr F. I’m 155cm 5 foot 1. I weighted my self today and apparently I gained about 13kg which is about 20lbs I think. I weighted at 69 kg I think that’s around 160lbs? which is massive for a small person like me. I’m at the highest weight I ever been ..I didn’t realize how bad it was. I used to be so much smaller and I let my self go big time. Iv been feeling sad and angry at my self. I don’t want to go out anymore or see anyone or even allow my self to think I could be in a relationship any time soon. I feel ashamed for being at this size. My stomach got so big I feel so unattractive ..I struggled with my weight my whole life. And it’s fucking insane the fact that I’m 28 years old and still having the same problem. I hate my self. And all I want to do now is starve my self for a month to lose as much weight as possible so I can feel semi normal again.
602,I think my aunt is in danger,"Long story short. My aunt is a nice lady working in a kindergarten. She had a nice relationship with her husband who was a football coach. He had problems with his heart and made a surgery. Because of this he couldn't continue his job.

From this moment many things changed. He first seemed fine, but then retreated in his cabin in the village, not wanting to communicate with no one. Initially my aunt was visiting him and spending time with him. But he started to become jealous. Imagining that my aunt is cheating him with another man.

This problem increases so much with time. He became crazy and very probably schizophrenic. Avoids his son and daughter. Says that he's not his father. Avoids his own family. Threatens my aunt. She says when they talk on the phone he's acting like crazy, yelling at her, insulting her, threatening that he will come and do something to her. He says that he's seeing my aunt there in the village with some other man (she's not even going there anymore). My aunt said that when she was still visiting him, she saw him all night watching porn and then he would say that she's the one in the video... when they were all alone there, in the isolated village, he was spying on her while she was talking shower thinking she's with some other man there. Crazily paranoid.

Last thing that happened, his son visited him and he told him that he's not his father anymore and that he was planning, if he seems my aunt, to break her neck...
He's denying that he needs help, no matter if all the members of the family talked to him and tried to help him. 

He has guns there in his village that he used for protection and sport. That's another alarming thing. My aunt and her son now decided to talk with a policeman to see what they can do.

Can anyone please help me with any advice? What can be done in this situation? He still didn't hurt anyone physically. 
How is best to approach a man like that? To play his game without being in danger? 
Why he became so crazy and different? He was a very respected man that loved his family and wife. Nothing like this happened in the past. I know that the surgery changed him because he can't work anymore (even if he's still taking salary), but how is it possible to change you so much? (I know that he has been jealous in the past too, but in the limits of normal, without making big problems)
What can I do to help my aunt?  If he doesn't want to go to a psychiatrist and thinks doesn't need help, what can be done?"
603,My mood swings are probably the worst they’ve ever been and I don’t know how to get help,"The past few days have been the worst. My mood shifts from great to extremely low pretty much every other week and at this point I just feel alone. 

At the moment I’m at the lowest low and I keep crying for no reason at the smallest things, I didn’t make it into work over the weekend and I can’t bring myself to call in because I just feel stupid so I just switched my phone off. I went to the doctor last year about this and he told me I could have anxiety. I don’t think so honestly, I can be very confident when I’m in the right mood. 

I’m just stuck and have no idea who to turn to, I really can’t help myself anymore.. it’s just never going to stop, back and forth forever it really pisses me off how unpredictable my own mood can be, I would give anything to just switch it off and go back to normal"
604,i'm not sure where else to post this... (kinda nsfl? tw animal death/animal abuse descriptions),"alt account because a few friends know my main account, but they'll recognize this username as an inside joke anyways.... oh well. hoping to use this for venting etc.

Lately I've been having so many thoughts about consuming living rodents... I have gone through (and continue to go through) a lot of trauma in my life and I have been diagnosed with depression, social anxiety and ADHD, but I cant imagine how any of these could link to that desire to consume and kill a living creature... its more than just an intrusive thought, I keep thinking about biting through the skull of a mouse and decapitating it with my mouth, its a genuine desire. These thoughts have been developed over a period of time where I haven't visited my therapist (for my SAD/depression, but he can refer me to someone I'm sure), however I do have appointments scheduled for the future and will see him eventually, so please do not take this as a request for a diagnosis, I just need someone to point a finger in the right direction. Google has brought me no results.

I know this place is meant to be judge free, but I still feel shame in admitting I do have nonhuman feelings, as I align with an animal xenogender (yōtengender, not too complicated. just coyote-like) and may consider myself therian/otherkin sometime.... but I don't feel like this is a good explanation at all. I don't know if its something about wanting to assert power over a creature,  wanting to become more ""primal"" or ""feral"" or literally an iron deficiency (as silly as it sounds I don't get a very good iron intake and have a lot of meat cravings, so that *might* be an explanation.... but I doubt it)

Sorry about this long, probably disturbing post. Also I should note that while I am a minor (my reasons for not disclosing my age are quite complicated and I do not want to get into it), this is not an attempt to be ""I'm jus  a twisted  fucjing   cycle   path,,,,,,"" post (I hate comparing anything to that as I'm sure that stereotype is mostly used to discredit children who are genuinely struggling with dangerous mental health issues), this is something I've brought up with close friends and my partner. And I feel weird even feeling like I have to say this, but no, It's not a sexual thing."
605,Is it normal to randomly feel completely empty while doing anything?,"So for context, this happens at random where I sometimes could be in the middle of something when I get hit with a wave of emptiness. I have anxiety, so whenever this emptiness appears my anxiety starts making me hyperventilate. I've tried before to find an explanation for this feeling of emptiness, but it never has a reason and I usually end up sitting there for a few mins to an hour letting it pass over. It does get in the way of daily life sometimes, and throws off my motivation for just living for days at times. I would talk to someone about it, but I don't know what it is.

Any thoughts on what I could do to stop this, or even opinions on what it could be would be helpful. Thank you!"
606,Men’s mental health,"Designing a website for men’s mental health and talking about problems

Hi so I’m currently trying to combine things that I’m passionate about and I’m looking at starting a website based around men’s mental health and communication and where people can seek advice.

607,Extreme distress/panic while working???,"I have severe issues with suicidal OCD, depression, anxiety. It is ruining my life but the real issue is working. I feel horrible every day normally but when I'm working it kicks into overdrive. Yesterday I actually felt really good and was doing chores and cleaning but then when I went to work It was like I got run over by a train. My job isn't really very stressful or overly difficult (I work in a warehouse) but the whole time I'm working I have obsessive thoughts about how I need to die soon because I can't keep on working and how today is finally going to be the day that I end it or that I need to quit my job and start getting everything in order financially for me to die so my dad can easily get all of my money and other similar thoughts. The best way I can describe it is obsessive thoughts at the speed of light and images flashing in my brain uncontrollably. But then when I get out of work I go back to normal then the whole cycle repeats (normal =/= feeling good but way better than while working). I really don't know what to do I have tried tons of different supplements for stress relief and they do work sometimes (not reliably) and my doctor prescribed me Lexapro and it kind of helps but it does nothing most of the time. My father keeps on telling me to see a psychologist but I really don't know how they could help me. Has anybody else with a similar problem found any solutions or ways to cope with this? I am Male and 19 years old if it matters."
608,Can't let arguments go and they continue in my head even a year later,"I'm not quite sure if this is the right sub, so let me know if this should go somewhere else. 

I have a lot of trouble letting arguments go especially when the conflict isn't resolved and will never be. I replay the arguments in my head and I also create entirely new arguments about other scenarios that didn't happen but couldn't have. I feel like I'm always arguing with someone in my head and it's made me sad and angry. 

There are 3 people I argue with most (in my head of course) and these conflicts will never be resolved and I need to let them go, but psychologically and emotionally I have no idea how to do that. The initial/ actual arguments happened in November 2020, August 2020, and October 2019. The one in November and October were with my best friends at the time and we no longer talk anymore (and both have refused to resolve the conflict). The one in August was with someone I haven't talked to since middle school and don't really plan on talking to again. It was an argument about covid and BLM which are both very common topics. So whenever they come up, I think about that argument again and come up with other things I could have said, etc.  

I just really need to let these things go. It feels like I'm practicing for an argument that isn't going to happen especially since arguments don't solve the conflict, respectful conversations do but that's not gonna happen either, so there's no point to any of it. It also doesn't help that these arguments usually trigger the emotions and memories that led up to the arguments. So I keep reliving all of these arguments every day (sometimes multiple times a day which isn't a healthy thing. 

I think I need to work through these arguments somehow so these situations feel resolved and I stop thinking about them, but I don't know how to go about doing that. I just want to stop feeling so angry and sad. I want to move on with my life."

610,We’ve Got Depression All Wrong. It’s Trying to Save Us - Alison Escalante M.D.," 

&gt;Eventually, if these modern triggers last long enough, the body decides it can’t get away. Next comes immobilization which the body triggers to defend us. According to Porges, what we call depression is the cluster of emotional and cognitive symptoms that sits on top of a physiological platform in the immobilization response. It’s a strategy meant to help us survive; the body is trying to save us. Depression happens for a fundamentally good reason.  
And that changes everything. When people who are depressed learn that they are not damaged, but have a good biological system that is trying to help them survive, they begin to see themselves differently. After all, depression is notorious for the feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. But if depression is an active defense strategy, people may recognize they are not quite so helpless as they thought.

614,Stopping a med Cold Turkey,"About 3 months ago, I switched my medications from Effexor and Lithium to Wellbutrin and Latuda. About a week ago my Latuda dosage was raised from 20 mg to 40 mg. Since then, the feeling of numbness/emptiness has gotten worse. I also now feel nothing physically during sex. I feel completely asexual/female equivalent to impotence. 

Would it it be crazy to stop taking the Latuda to see if that feeling decreases? I’m working on scheduling an appt with my dr, but in the meantime, I don’t want to keep feeling this way. I figured worse case, my other symptoms flair up. If that happens, I’ll start taking the meds again until my appt.

Just looking for a second opinion I guess. Or maybe this is me wanting someone to know I’m doing this and can hold me accountable if stopping the meds makes things worse."

I can’t and won’t say my life is boring or mundane by any means i have a norm family and some good friends but, every single day 90% of the time i feel like life is pointless, that nothing makes me happy anymore, nothing excites me anymore, nothing is fun anymore... i was talking to my friend the other day and we talked about last year and i realized that just wandering in the streets and talking to him (or doing some regular activity) was 1000 x more fun/exciting for me.. like listening to music last year was more fun than winning the lottery this year (just a hypothetical situation d ) so everything lost it’s fun, everything became less exciting and mundane. Even if i feel good/happy for a few minutes, even then i think how tomorrow will be the same, that I’m going to go home, sleep, wake up and live the same life.

618,Is it normal to want to cause violence?,Asking for a friend
619,Might have to get back to distance relationship,"Hello everybody, I've come to seek some advise.
So I don't even know where to start.

tl;dr I might need to get back to a weekend relationship with my girlfriend of almost 2 years but she does not take it very well due to her metal health. Yet none of us knows where I get a job IF I even get one. (in that case I'd stay here and have to continue the studying) 

I am in a relationship with my girlfriend for around 1,5ish years now. We lived 2h apart from each other and for the first year we saw each other every weekend and every free day she had. She is in the last year of her job training and I am currently studying, yet due to corona I'm able to study online and therefore moved in with her since she had just moved out last autumn. Since I'm the one who can more easily move at the moment due to studying I'm here now. But I am desperately looking for my own job training since I've never wanted to study in the first place but I cant get any job anywhere eventho I'm applying with an above required degree. As of right now I'm applying as well here where we currently live, just as much as where my family is, since we've talked a lot (about everything, our communication is really good) and came to the conclusion I need a job and either I get something at her place or she'll have to get something at my place.

So far so good. But now the times running, I just don't get any replies and the ones I get are in my region of the country and hardly here. That's starting to freak her out since she has trouble finding something in my region (she's in health insurance).

I'd be okay with getting back to a weekend/distance kinda relationship again for as long as the training is going since she knows I really need to finally get one. But it just breaks my heart when we have to talk about it because she can't be alone really well. She goes to therapy and as everyone has, she got her little package. She's not really able to be alone since she suffers from anxiety, sometimes waves depression, and most recently rocd. We talk a lot about these topics because she needs a lot of reassurens when she gets into overthinking.

I need a job and I want to be there for her. I'd even try to get sent internationally in the company I'd get a training in to be closer to her, but I can only do so much. I've been desperate with applying and interviews for the 2nd year now.

There's so much more to it due to the mental health part/ our communication and the general job situation of the both of us but I feel like this essay of a reddit post won't even be read due to its length already so I'll cut it off right here."
620,Repressed Memories?,"Sorry for my “all over the place” method of typing I have trouble arranging my thoughts.

I’m a 20 year old male diagnosed with ADHD and OCD, and I had a really bad pill addiction in middle school and high school. I was over-prescribed medication that started my addiction, so I have a general distrust towards. A lot of medical professions even though I know that’s irrational. Towards the end of my senior year I got clean before heading to college. Almost all of the time that I was using feels completely lost to me, I barely remember any of it. However, lately for some reason certain things will trigger flashbacks that really fuck me up. When they happen, I feel like my chest is getting tight and I get dizzy. Once I think I had a panic attack and fainted. My addiction was a huge part of my formative years as a teenager, but it seems like that wasn’t even me, and I was reborn once I got clean. The memories feel like someone else’s and when they come back I tell myself they didn’t happen, but they did and it’s starting to take a toll on my mental health since I constantly feel like I’m crazy. What is happening to me??"
621,My neighbors trigger my anxiety/depression,"Idk if this is normal or what the root issue is here but ever since I’ve lived in a subdivision with nosey/friendly neighbors (depending on how you look at it) I’ve felt my anxiety and depression worsen. The neighbors on both sides of me constantly say hi and want to ask about my life every single time I’m outside, the kids on one side come running over and demand to play with my kids literally the SECOND I step outside almost every time. If I want to do yard work in peace and be left alone someone wants to wave or ask me a question or come say hi. It’s gotten to the point where I never go outside in the front or back unless either it’s dark outside or I’m going straight to my car to leave. Idk if this a form of agoraphobia? The neighbors also will come and ring the doorbell and demand/ask to play with my kids and whine and ask questions and sometimes even  try to come inside or look into my house without asking when I open the door. It makes me feel like a prisoner in my home and ruins my day a lot of times because for some reason that feeling of like you never know when they are going to start ringing the doorbell for 20 minutes sends me into a nervous spiral that causes me to get snappy and want to just disappear and lay in bed. My dog also barks and his barking causes me to spiral too because I feel like all the neighbors hate me and are judging me for having a barking dog. Can anyone relate to this or do I need serious help? Some other things that stress me out about living in a neighborhood is having an unkempt yard when other neighbors have nice yards and my “husband”/roommate never helps me and I feel immense pressure to mow/rake/keep up a gigantic front and back yard all by myself or just look like the trashy family on the street"

These thoughts are crippling SO and it is so hard to see their suffering. These battles are so hard and it can feel so defeating. I want to know your happy endings, words of advice, encouragement and whatever you would tell your past self when you were in a similar scenario. I will be finding a therapist myself once insurance providers changes, I just need some positivity and hope to give me some courage right now."
624,It's just a simple venting,"I wanted to help sincerely. BUT AT THE END I FUCKED UP (or not?..). YOU KNOW. And now... I experience a lot of mental pain. As usual. Even if this person isn't mad at me... Or they're mad at me? Maybe they're hid this? Haha... I can't trust their words. I can't trust anyone fully. Anyway... It's time for self-loathing and overwhelming shame for my  insignificant and trashy life. I don't know why I even exist. I'm tired of my... mental health. I don't know what's happening with me. And I can't help it. I can't go to the professional. I don't know why I'm even writing this. Maybe it'll ease the pain. Ah, stop. If I fuck up here too, I'll suffer even more. But... I keep writing the post anyway. So strange. Haha... A couple of hours ago I was euphoric (maybe) about studying anthropology (I had never been interested in such things), and now... I'm in pain and not interested in anything. I don't know how long this will go on. It repeats over and over again. I'm lost. Everything around seems so unreal. I don't understand why people run around like squirrels in a wheel. It's so useless. They don't know the truth, maybe? They are blinded by sweet lies? Don't know. Okay. I think I need to stop. No one will ever read this post anyway."
625,I called a suicide hotline and I now think I will survive the day,"And tomorrow at least. The woman on the other line stayed on call with me for an hour and 20 minutes.

My life is still falling apart but it felt good to talk to someone."
626,I have been feeling like shit lately and I'm dragging everyone around me down,"For the past little while I've been feeling more terrible than usual and idk how to make it stop. I've been sleeping until 1pm every day, after going to bed at like 6am. I'll get up and skip lunch, lay in bed til probably 3/4pm, then have dinner. After that I'll usually call with a couple friends and then lay in bed on my phone until I pass out... its definitely not healthy

But recently a lot of people have been asking me if I'm okay constantly, and I tell them I am cause I dont really want them to worry more, but idek what I'm feeling. I just feel bad. I tried getting dressed today cause usually getting dressed and putting on makeup makes me feel more confident and happy, but I just feel fat in these clothes and haven't put on any makeup yet cause my acne has been terrible and idk if I wanna make it worse... but I just wish that this worked.

The pandemic certainly doesnt help either. I havent seen my friends in so long and I just want to hug someone so badly. My family is driving me insane aswell, since Ontario went into a second lockdown and I'm stuck here with them. I've been struggling a lot with my ED recently with overeating because of the holidays, and so soso much food guilt. I want to lose the weight I gained but even getting out of bed these days is just so hard. I just want to feel better. I want to be able to have someone hug me and make me feel better and comfortable and not so alone. I need to be near another human so bad. 

I just feel so out of it and usually I get over this feeling and feel better one or two days later, but now I just feel like shit and see no end in sight. Any advice to push this out of the way?"

628,Its hard not to be irrated with my own self,"I have toxic traits and I'm aware of those traits, yet I still do it. Not necessarily the ones that affect other, but me on myself. I don't know wht but I always want a punishment. I want someone to punch me or take things away from me. I know its annoying and I don't necessarily deserve it, but whenever I do the smallest thing incorrectly, my mind goes from confident to a peice of shit

I don't self harm or anything, but I have caught myself doing small things like punching my leg or biting my hand. Its like I have all of this pent up energy and I wish I could take it out on myself. I want the worse for me and I want to suffer even though that sounds really stupid saying it out loud

It seems like my mother noticed too. She's worried about me and thinks I should look to God, but have my doubts about religion. She also thinks therapy but I don't think I'm ready for/want it. 

I don't know why I'm so sensitive and can't stop blaming myself for everything, but my mind reverts back to it the moment the smallest inconvenience happens. Crying and hating myself isn't going to get me anywhere. I feel awful. I don't know why I'm like this"

630,Feeling incredibly empty and lonely when not having social interactions with friends / family.,"This can’t be normal. When I’m with my friends I have the best time ever. I’m distracted from myself and my inner problems, I can just focus on my friends and the group, making jokes, laughing or having amazing conversations. 

The problem: when all of this is over and I’m back alone, the good feeling of the social encounters doesn’t last long, 1-2 days max. It’s like the low after a drug high. I’m getting lonely so quickly and question myself. I need social interaction so frequently that when I don’t, I’m just down and depressed. I start crying in my bed and feeling this stinging in my chest, like the emptiness and loneliness shivering from there. 

It’s such a problem that I seek a way to lighten my mood in an extern source. If my friends or family or anyone wasn’t there, I’d just stay sad because I wouldn’t have a (quick) way to make myself happy. Surely, there exist things that make me happy outside of social interactions, which is pursuing creative hobbies, running,...but when I’m in this down phase I can’t move myself to do any of it. Not even walking outside for a few minutes to feel better. 


I want to work on myself. How can I train myself to not fall into a hole when I’m alone for a while? How can I be more fulfilled with only my own head as company? Please leave some insight, opinions, help or suggestions. I can’t really find something about this in the internet and I’m very desperate at this point."
631,What do you call someone who does this?,"

This girl posted to Facebook that her Ariana grande Instagram fan account got wrongly banned yesterday. She said she had 15.3k followers and 4 years with of pictures on it. I guess she got into it with other fan accounts a few months back and recently they mass reported her account and got it banned. 

So since last night she’s made 14 blank Instagram accounts across her phone and her 2 iPads and has been going back and forth reporting other fans accounts for impersonation. She got 38 accounts banned as of today alone. She posts screenshots from Instagram support saying they took the accounts down, then she posts the owners of the accounts freaking out on Twitter. She also got some of their backup accounts taken down too. She’s like proud of this. 

She said there are a few accounts Instagram refuses to take down no matter how many times she reports them and she’s asking for help in reporting their accounts. She said this is payback for her account getting wrongly banned and because of that everyone’s fan accounts are getting banned. So then everyone can feel her pain about losing all the followers and pictures. 

She thinks it’s hysterical, the sad thing is she’s 20 years old doing this. Sitting at home, wasting all these hours, getting peoples accounts banned for no reason as some type of “revenge”. She is relentlessly posting about all this, with all these screenshots, since last night. It’s almost 5pm and she’s still doing it. I think this is next level petty and immature. She gets mad if you tell her to stop, grow up, or ask why she’s doing this."
632,New here... is it ok if I vent a little?,"Hi r/mentalhealth I’m a 22 year old guy from the UK, I recently got diagnosed with a health condition and I found that the subreddit for it helped me out quite a bit so I thought I’d try this page to seek a bit of help or advice for my bad feelings.

I really don’t know where to start... honestly I feel like I’m totally pathetic, I worry neurotically about so many things now, I’m filled with fear, bitterness, sadness and hatred towards everything and anything, most days I just want to break down and cry I’m welling up just typing out this post.

My primary concern is my health, I have crippling health anxiety, it started when I was 18 when I developed a strange inflammation in my tonsils that has never gone away, doctors said it was nothing and pretty much ignored me after running every test imaginable at my request, nearly two years went by and I was horribly stressed the whole time resulting in me loosing and then putting on a lot of weight from comfort eating and I damaged the cartilage in my jaw from going to bed and tensing in my sleep.

Eventually I got over it, fast forward to a month after my 22nd birthday I woke up with the worst pain imaginable in my foot, turns out I inherited susceptibility to gout from my mom and grandfather, the pain and the risk the condition poses to my joints and kidneys I cannot bare, I’m in the process of getting this managed with medication but in general it set off my health anxiety, I feared organ failure, constant pain and becoming disabled.

I was born with a rare adrenal deficiency condition which requires that I take a low dose of steroids “prednisolone” for the rest of my life, I started at age 6 and in recent years I’ve become I ceased with the potential long term side effects of medication, are they going to waste my bones away? Mess up my blood sugar and cause diabetes? Give me cataracts? Wear out my liver or kidneys? So much goes on I’m my mind and it keeps me in a constant state of dread and fear about the future.

I just don’t know what to do.

Sorry it’s a long post, but thank you for reading and replying"
633,Im scared off faking my mental issues,"Last summer i was extremely suicidal but through some help i got through it. This summer my friend was extremely suicidal and i helped him with his depression and anxiety and that's what triggered fear of me faking everything that i went through that summer because i wanted attention even thoughi haven't told a lot of people of what i went through. I have been feeling down too but i am scared of myself,if im faking it. I have symptoms of depression and have taken over 100 tests and have been diagnosed with depression but ik still not convinced. There's a part of me telling that im faking it and thats why i haven't told people how i feel. I only have told them that im not to mentaly stable but that's it. Im afraid of asking my parents to take me to a psychologist because they are going to think im doing this because of attention. I seriously need someone to talk to so he can give me his opinion on this shit"
634,Its alot to read but if you do thanks,"I got abused verbally and sometimes physically by my father when I was very young. My mother was very caring and loving but she was so scared of him. And thats her sin. I dont want to go much into it bcz my english its a bit awful but once I was imprisoned in my house for 3 months straight during summertime. Everything becouse I did a pool game with a friend. I went through a lot of shit. Got bullied alot and never had anyone to back me up when I would tell my father he would beat me becouse he thinked Im the bad one. I think I got bullied for 3 years straight by some guys till I didn’t wanna be that guy anymore and kicked some ass. My mother suffered alot from him but now I hate her even though I know she loves me and she suffered much. I hate her becouse she didnt do shit to prevent it or divorce or some shit. Im a big mofo (freak) and I would of done great in sports but fuck my father never let me do anything never let me chose any road I wanted. He just said you are going to school study alot and be a doctor. After some years I become crazy and when I was 17 I started to break shit in the house. My father was scared of me. I just wanted them to understand me and know that he made a mistake and I’m not normal. He was actually scared of me but never accepted his mistake becouse I know that would burn to him. (Also my father did a car accident before my birth and was in coma for some months got a lot of brain damage and its a miracle he is alive) Did a lot of mistakes smoked for 5 years. Now I’m 22 still cant forgive my father and also my mum which I know she suffered sooooo much and she done soooo much for me but still cant forgive her. I want to but cant find the streength. I can tell you I’m mentally fucked even though everyone thinks I’m ok. Im not like everyone. Im very introverted (bad mofo though I once kicked the ass of to guys which were in their 30 and I wasnt even 18 😂. I’m ready to die). But im so awful I’m shy as fuck becouse I know I’m not a normal guy never had a normal life (never had a childhood). Never been part or feelt that I fit somewhere. I know I have complex PTSD and I think only good and me working on it can make it better. I have to live with this all my life. Thats not fair life its not fair. I’ve got so much potential but still Complex PTSD is ruining me. Its literally hell. I often remind myself how strong I am and I know for a fact if someone was in my place and grew up in that house he would of become crazy or killed himself. Now I’m 22. I am an emigrant to another country to built a future becouse where I was from people worked for 200€ a month. Its hard as fuck to speak another language, I have no friends noobody. Will have to wait 6 more months to get a visa and start a job. I’m losing my mind with this lockdown going on. I don’t know how I’m going to make it if I feel so weird and fucked around people. Im scared to go out I’m even scared to go to the fucking barber. Complex PTSD is awful. (Coming from a guy which I dont care beeing in a fight but I feel so weird and bad around crowds). I dont think nothing can cure it. I will just stick to good and pray to him for help and will do all I can to make actions myself. If anybody went through all this I just wrote thank you so much. Its so tough that even my mother refuses I have complex ptsd becouse if she thinks I have it its going to burn alot to her and she will never be in peace. Please If you read this and are going through it let me have a message let me hear something from you."
635,(Tw: self-harm) what can be the best way to help my friend?," I have a friend who has been self-harming for more than 2 years, i don't know if i should try to start the conversation or wait until she talks to me, a year ago on march 2020 she did talk to me about how she was cutting her arm, i was stupid and i just told her that everyone loves her and cheering her up but i didn't get deeper in the topic, i completely forgot about it, then on December 23rd 2020 she was talking about it in a group chat and i was stupid (again) and i called her crying because the news triggered me, she hasn't talked to me (that much) since then, she didn't tell me anything about her self-harm for for more than 10 months, she knows i'm worried and she feels bad about making me cry, she sometimes talk about it in a chat and gave advices about how to do it, where to do it, how to hide it and how to handle the pain, she also taught another friend about cuts (they weren't talking about self-harm) which places you shouldn't cut, how deep, and she's very informed in general, she does not show signs of wanting to stop, she just sometimes talk about it in a humorous way, should i try to talk to her about my worries? Should i use light language or should i go straight to the point without using euphemisms or should i let her know that she can talk to me and wait until she talks to me about it? What are your thoughts?

Messages, advices, stories and points of view are appreciated"
636,"I cant help but always think about how lonely i am, what do i do?","Hey, first time posting because this ones important to me

M17 6Ft3 bulky build (it will make sense why im including height later)

So im just a regular college student (UK) has two friend groups and people i can really trust and people that i know care for me, never had any relationship all my life which is something i think about alot, dont know of thats a bad thing?

Im generally bigger than most people i meet and i always have this hollow feeling in my stomach, like i cant really put it into words but i just feel empty, i see all these couples around and i can see how happy they are and i wanna be one of those people but i cant, i dont want sex i dont want money i just wanna be held by someone who loves, and thats something ive never felt and it hurts

any idea how i can ease these emotions or something similar?"
637,Experience getting off SSRI’s?,"I had never needed psychiatric care until after I had my son a little over a year ago (though I have had subclinical depression/anxiety/ocd before). I had ppd/ppa so bad and sudden I’d describe it as “my brain broke” and am still on high dose of Zoloft. My psychiatrist said we could start tapering off in the spring (he likes to time it that way because of seasonal factors). Anyone want to share their experiences, what to look out for, etc? He said 30% of people can’t get off of them once they start. That’s pretty good odds."
638,I (F) feel trapped with my emotionally abusive mother.,"This is my first time posting so I’m sorry if I mess up. I really just wanted a chance to talk because I don’t want to burden my fiancée anymore than I have been. I’m also sorry that this will be vague, I’m terrified of my mother finding this post and will have to change some facts to keep her from recognizing it. I’ve struggled with mental health since I was a little kid, but obviously didn’t know what depression was. My father was extremely emotionally abusive towards me, my mother, and my siblings. I can’t be too specific but all of my siblings now suffer from anger issues, depression, anxiety, and have a history of abusing substances. I know this make us sound like we’re all a mess but we’ve actually been doing somewhat okay now. However, my mental health quickly deteriorated because of the pressure I felt to be a parent. I cooked, cleaned, worked, took care of babies by myself, helped with homework, and did my best to shield my younger siblings from my step dad. This was all going on while I was at the age of 10-17. I couldn’t really go out with friends or my boyfriend because my time was spent helping to raise the kids. My “father” never got up to help and my mother would spend most of her time at work to avoid the house. My poor examples of relationships also led me to enter into abusive relationships throughout high school. But I can’t really blame my parents for that, I made those choices. When my mom divorced the terrible man, I thought I could finally be free. I was tired of never being able to talk, breathe, and living in fear. I know I was never beaten and should be grateful for that, but it still hurt so much. I thought my life would get better because I was finally going to college, I had a job, a wonderful fiancée, and was planning a great future. However, I realized that my abuser was still living with me. I was so focused on my father hurting me that I didn’t realize my mom had been manipulating, gaslighting, and running me down since I was little. I thought I could just move out, but then Covid happened and I lost my job. My fiancée doesn’t make enough to support us both if we moved out, and I’m really struggling to find a new job. I’m contemplating suicide again for the first time in 5 years. I feel trapped and I’m scared. I’m even scared to post this on reddit, I might even delete it later. My fiancée is being very supportive and I know I’ve been worrying them. But I feel bad that they’re working so hard to help me. I feel worthless and I really don’t know if I can wait any longer to leave my mom. But I also have no where else to go. I know I sound pathetic in this post, my life isn’t all bad. I’m just struggling and really have no one to help me."
639,Vent *TW Self Harm*,"I’ve dealt with anxiety from a very young age and basically bottled it all up until eventually I needed a way to release it and that resorted to self harming. Even worse my mother has never been understanding with mental health, so I never bring it up as it gets dismissed or she becomes very angry with me and shameful. (she once noticed what I had done to my arms and before I left for work stated in a disgusting tone “what are you’re coworkers gunna think of you?” It hurt my soul so much, to be so judged and shamed by someone I love of something I seriously couldn’t control I was in such a place of hurting.)

A year later I had been diagnosed and on medication, I was doing better at the start of 2020 until a death in the family (from which I went off my medication and stopped going to the doctor.) of course things got a bit dark again. 

At that time I started dating a really nice guy who is super understanding of mental health, and has been there for me a lot of the time. Although, I’ve noticed over the past few months I’ve been growing worse and worse and I know it’s starting to not only affect our relationship but him. I worry him so much to the point where I think I’m giving him anxiety. I know how tiring it must be to support me sometimes and I know it’s selfish of me if I don’t eventually get help from a professional and keep putting him through it.He recently made an ultimatum where if I don’t try (at least) to seek help he is going to get my mother involved. I have tried relentlessly explaining to him not to get her involved as she will get angry with me, but I’m not so sure he understands. I really do want help, but also I don’t? Hurting all the time (and hurting the ones I love) is something I want to stop doing I WANT to be happier and have more good days than bad. But at the same time there’s almost an addiction to the way I feel and the release I get when harming. 

I just don’t know what to do."
640,I'm ending my life.,It's been a good run but i see no purpose anymore. Everyone has left and i have nobody.
641,Does anyone else feel so disconnected and 'dull' about their own lives?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. I don't frequent reddit that often and am just reaching out somewhere to see if someone else feels the same.  However I understand this is really long and likely won't be read, I just want to get my thoughts out somewhere I guess.  Also, I am 20 years old for some context.  I also don't know what to flair this.

I don’t feel real. It’s hard for me to feel strong positive emotions. I feel strong negative emotions but those are more just in my head, like how I feel about myself or life in general but not in reaction to a specific even that happened usually. So even those negative emotions don’t feel that ‘real’ because they aren’t really tied to specific events and I often don’t talk to anyone about them. I don’t have a job right now, which is an issue, but I quit my job shortly after I started college. Now my classes have been online and I don’t connect with my roommate at all. We barely talk. So typically I don’t have meaningful interactions day to day. I don’t have any close friends and I don’t have a boyfriend. I did, and we still see each other sometimes, but we’re broken up. I’m still in love with what we use to have where as he is very far removed from me and it shows.  It would be healthier for me to just cut off seeing him but I can’t really deal with that emotionally so I’m trying to let it happen gradually. That’s sort of working, I’ve been feeling more disconnected from him too because he doesn’t really interact with me even when we are physically together. So I feel disconnected from most activities and people. I don’t have many talents, no musical abilities or any special hobbies. I want to learn but haven’t committed to teaching myself and classes cost a lot of money. Lately I’ve been trying to do whatever comes to mind when it comes to mind, like baking or reading or cleaning, in attempt to go with that immediate desire and feel something from it but I just don’t feel that connection. I don’t feel connected to the world.  I have future plans and desires but the only thing I’m really working towards directly is getting my degree. Otherwise a lot of things feel out of my control, even though I know they really aren’t. I want to meet people so badly but I’ve been making excuses because of the pandemic. It has genuinely been so difficult though, particularly with my classes being online and no job. I think I don't feel real because I’ve always had such a different vision of what I’d be like in life at this age and now I am so, so different from that.  I don't know how to value my life as it is now.  I’m not actively suicidal but every time I drive somewhere, I think about ‘what would happen’ if I got into a crash and died, even though I’m aware I wouldn’t be around to see what would happen and also don’t desire that necessarily. It’s just in my daily thoughts, but I’m not going to commit suicide and don’t consider myself suicidal. I have future plans but I don’t know if I honestly believe I’ll get there someday since my current life is so much different than I thought I would make it be. I’m working on my confidence and hoping that will help but everything just feels like I’m ‘hoping’ on it. I never feel good enough, but that has been an issue since childhood and I just have never been the person I want to be so that feeling makes sense to me and will go away whenever I finally become the person I want to be. My degree depends on this program I’m applying for next fall but I’m not prepared at all for past reasons I can’t change now so that just feels like a ‘hope’ too. I honestly don’t know what to do even though I know there are things I could be doing like get a job and reach out to strangers in hopes of some sort of connection. I wish I had a therapist that could maybe help me through this period of my life, but I can’t afford that and am not close enough to any family to reach out to them. During quarantine, I started smoking weed to feel more of a connection to things like music or just myself in general and that worked at first. I wouldn’t do it daily, just every few days or weeks if I had nothing else to do in the evening, which was most days. All of my senses were amplified and I just felt good. I only did it about once a month after the semester started though and then picked it up again more frequently once winter break started. But now it’s started to make my sense feel more dull if anything and I just zone out even more, so I’ve stopped that as well. I know I’m not of value to the world and that’s fine, I don’t need to be the next Elon Musk and most people are just little ants in our own miniature worlds. That’s okay with me, but my own miniature world doesn’t feel like it really exists. I feel like I only sometimes exist in other people’s worlds for a short amount of time. I never feel like the ‘main character’ in my own world so to speak. And then the thing is, I’m not really involved in anyone’s world that heavily. I don’t have friends, I’m not close with family, and at the moment I don’t have colleagues or classmates. I’ve been afraid of my grades suffering if I start a job, but I applied to one for limited hours because I think having a low commitment job for regular social interaction would help. That happiest period of my life was when I took a year between high school and college at 18 to work a full time job (though I lived at home and wasn’t paid enough to sustain myself and move out) and was also in a new happy relationship at the time. I was social even if I didn’t have any close friends still and the new relationship was exciting. I was happy before the relationship as well but that was definitely a bonus. But I don’t want to go back to any of that, I need to go forward to something better that is setting me up for that future I’ve been thinking about. I feel so disconnected from myself and the world. I don’t know how to ‘amplify’ my sense and positive emotions again.   If you've read this far, have you felt like this?  Did I somehow convey how I've been feeling through that mess?"
642,Time is becoming to much and I can’t wait any longer,I’m in love with someone who lives very far away we’ve already made plans and everything but we can’t fully be together for a few more years and it’s really killing me inside. I’ve never felt this way about anyone before and I’ve had other partners before. I’m genuinely in love to the point where it feels like soul mates. I can’t wait why does time have to move so slow? Why am I being so overwhelmed with doubt in my mind? I want to be with them so bad already why did we have to be so far apart how can I make time feel faster? Why can’t I stop thinking of them? Why can’t they be in my arms already?
643,Why is it that most times I have a really low self esteem but on the rare occasions I compare myself to god is that normal?,The title says it all 9/10 times I'm pretty quiet and don't care much about anything but for a moment I might think I'm greater than everyone else at something but only for a minute or two
644,A very odd and confusing few months for me,"Hello, first time posting here though I have been lurking for a little while.

So today I figured I'd just go ahead and post since I'm feeling a bit proud of myself for simply having the energy do something and deciding to use it to clean my room and do some laundry.

I had been feeling absolutely no energy to do anything except things I am forced to do since mid October. Somewhere around the middle of November I started feeling very depressed for no clear reason, this lasted about two weeks before I went back to just no energy. A couple weeks after that while I was trying to think of a concrete reason as to why it had happened, I realized that for the last several years I hadn't felt any strong emotions except for on some special occasions. This combined with the fact that I already don't think very highly of my self almost broke me down until I reached out to a friend for support in the first time I can remember. Talking with him helped my self image for a little while. Then only a week ago I had what I think is a panic attack. I was walking through the park with my dog, it was very busy and so I was quite irritated, we made our way to a bench and sat there for fifteen minutes, the whole while there were tons of people passing behind me. It's probably kind of important to mention I have adhd inattentive type and I forgot to take my meds. Since I had forgotten my meds I couldn't really keep my thoughts straight if I'm focusing on too much at one time. There are a lot of people around me, I have my dog to pay attention to, and I have music ok playing, so I decided to just get up and go home because I was getting a bit annoyed and didn't want to take it out on my dog. I purposely took side paths that are usually empty to avoid people but then of course people show up seconds after I get there, at this point my heart beat starts going up a lot as well. It's when I'm finally close to the exit when I run into a large family with a dog where I was going to turn that my heart beat shoots up, my thoughts are all in shambles, and I feel a strong irresistible urge to just get back home into my room as fast as possible. Once I get home I get a large cup of ice water, go up into my room and take my meds. Once I did that it took a good twenty minutes for me to calm down. It was latter that night I told the same friend what happened and he let me know it was probably a panic/anxiety attack. I still have no idea why it happened when I've been through the same situation many times before and only just then I couldn't handle it. 

On the bright side I finally managed to wake up with enough energy to clean my room so that's good.

I hope I didn't give anyone a stroke trying to read through  this though I doubt anyone will, regardless thanks if you did."
645,"Lately I have no motivation, not even to spend time with my hobbies. Add in the difficulty of dealing with my dad with early dementia, it's getting hard to keep up.","Basically, I have found that on weekends or my free time I don't feel like even getting up to eat with my family. 

The overall mood in my home is heavy because recently my dad started a process of early dementia and my sister-in-law, which also lives with us, also had an accident which left her with brain damage. She is recovering, slowly, but she is really moody and fights with everyone every day because of her condition.

Sitting down to eat with my family is uncomfortable so it's gotten to the point I lose my apettite.

To top it off, I recently found a great, steady job with good income, which had made it possible to move out if I saved up. But with my dad with dementia and all these problems around my family, I feel like I have my hands tied behind my back.

I'm just venting, maybe I will eventually refind my motivation, but I really want to stop feeling so cornered due to circumstances out of my control."

Hi, I'm Yves, I'm 17 years old and for the past year I've had hypochondria and it took a big tole. I costs a lot of energy and even though I'm kinda over it now, I still feel like shit.

I have better days too but they don't come along very often. Its come to the point where I sleep a lot Bcs its only moment I don't feel anything. Does anybody relate and what can I do?

648,Accepting I need help. TW,"Im currently on vacation with my boyfriend who I've been seeing just shy of a year (best thing to happen to me :'). Lastnight he saw me at my absolute lowest point. I was crying, hyperventilating and just losing my mind. I ""lost my mind"" after having flashbacks of my first relationship (also my last one before my now current one) that was both very physically and verbally abusive. Those flashbacks then led to flashbacks of getting r*ped 3 years ago, both situations were extremely vivid and I couldnt stop my mind from racing. Unfortunately both of the situations were happening during the same time. My ex became physically/verbally abusive after I told him I was r*ped, justifing it by saying I was probably asking for it. I was just on a big downward spiral lastnight and he was totally taken back. He knows only alittle bit of those two situation but has no idea on the depth of them and I think I scared him now. He looked me dead in my eyes and said he's scared and that I need help. I ended up calling my mom but she didn't answer due to the time of night. I only slept for maybe 1 hour and was just eager to talk to my mom (who only knows minor details of my first relationship and full details of the r*pe.) When she ended up texting me early in the morning, she told me I need to go see a therapist since I'm still dealing with such strong emotions/feelings 3 years later. I agreed which was really hard for me to do. I'm scared to open up to a stranger since not a single soul knows every single detail besides myself and how they correlate with each other. 2021 is gonna be the year I hopefully get my mental health right no matter how hard it is, even if I have to lose my current bf to focus on myself."
649,"Have you ever reached the point, where you just don’t care anymore?","Have you ever reached the point in your life, where you think: “I have messed up my life so bad, so now I’m just gonna mess it up more and have fun with it”? 
For me it’s like it has only gone downhill in the last couple of years and turned out worse and worse. I have tried fixing, seeking out for help and continuing from where I left. But even though I have made a couple of baby steps multiple times, I have been knocked down every single time again, and an accident rarely comes alone.
So now I don’t wanna try to make it better anymore. I have accepted that it ain’t worth anything, and just plain depressing. I don’t care about my life anymore. I don’t want to make it good. I wanna have fun with ruining it even more. Maybe if I keep doing it then, then maybe one day I will feel I’m living again"

652,I no longer have a reason to live TW: suicide and self harm,"I'm gonna be super vague - I don't want this linking back to me irl.
To set the scene I need to point out I have various completely undiagnosed both physical and mental illnesses. It takes so much work to get my parents to even take my to a doctor's, therefore most of my issues I have to deal with myself. These include forms of anxiety, depression and PTSD, neurological conditions, various heart issues, various GI issues and joint issues. Recently there have worsened (especially the GI issues) and have led to me not being able to eat more than a small amount without severe pain and sickness. The heart issues have meant that I can barely stand up without severe presyncope and dizziness. I have lost a huge amount of weight in the last few weeks.

As well as this, my sibling basiacly makes life living hell. They used to be incredibly violent to me, then it turned into more verbal - I couldn't go a day without them going on a rant about how worthless I am. It's now kind of merged into both. Fortunately for some reason being stuck at home with them has actually made it better - we have less time just the two of us. It is something I am now coming to realise is emotional abuse.w

When I was younger I was bullied for most of my childhood, by the people I classed as my friends. In fact my only memories of those (just under 10) years were the bullying. Because of it I have severe trust issues and spent most of my childhood alone. I struggle to talk to people openly without severe anxiety and have the constant fear everyone is judging me. (Because during that time period everyone was constantly judging me, talking behind my back etc).

I also had an abusive teacher, who I have not told anyone about due to fear. I remember part way throught he year he got ill (and I mean really ill) and was off school for months and everyone was really sad and there was me who was happy they were gone because it meant I had peace for longer.

Over the past 6 months I turned to self harm as a way to cope. It is the only thing I have found I can do that properly relieves the anxiety and stops me killing myself.

On to what happened.

I didn't eat much at lunch (due to GI issues) and my mum got super angry with me and went on this massive rant, telling me how I always moan too much about all your problems, and there is always something wrong with me. Like, you know, take me to the doctors. And so I completely stopped talking to her about my problems and now she's really irritated that I'm not telling her what's wrong.

She then went on to me saying how 'I never make an effort' but the problem is she does not realise the sheer amount of effort I put into simply being alive rn. I tell her like 1% of what's really going on in my life cuz she does not accept me at all. When I talk to her she tells me that ""it's my fault and that I need to sort myself out'. When i tried to explain about my emotionally abusive sibling I was told that ""all sibling fight, just get on with them"".

Then she took away my phone, which is my one safe space, my one thing I can actually get help on. This caused me to spiral into a depressive episode and I self harmed multiple times.

The worse part was when I was told ""you know I love you"". No I don't. You literally just gave a speech about how much you could not care less about me. Stop with the gaslighting that's not what I need.

Like one of the only reasons I am still alive right now is because I didn't want to hurt my family. But it turns out by dying I won't be hurting them, I'll be doing them, and everyone else a favour.

I'm sorry it's long. I've probably just wasted your time."
653,If I don’t have any sexual feelings should I seek help?,I don’t like anyone in the way I should like I can find a girl really attractive then when I try to talk to her anxiety over rides and I can’t even feel any emotion except the anxiety and how stupid I feel which completely sucks everyone around me is always telling me to download tinder yet I just don’t know maybe feeling will lift if I actually build a relationship with a girl it just sucks watching porn your whole life I want to change so bad.
654,Any advice/tips on how to reach out to my parents?,"I realize that probably not everyone wants to read my long story so, Do you have any tips that have helped you reach out to someone in person (in my case my parents) when you are going through a rough time mentally? I just want to add that both of my parents do have mental issues and would understand being in a depressive state but rarely have I talked to them about my emotions.

So basically since the middle of November I have been in a weird state mentally, basically sad, depressed and unsatisfied. I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and it has really changed my perspective on life, at least I think. I realize that I could've been diagnosed with worse and have just been thinking about life and death and time so much. Basically an existential crisis but also just a life crisis which I will get into. I had a bad experience when I was going under anesthesia for my colonoscopy where I thought that I was having a bad reaction to the anesthesia because I didn't fall asleep right away (like I had done before). My eyes got real big and my heart started beating really fast and then it was black and I was back recovering. It just made me wonder if going under aesthetic is what death is like and because I literally thought I might die in that moment it would have sucked going out scared. I felt so helpless and scared in that moment. I of course realize now that I wasn't having a reaction and that it sometimes does take a few seconds to fall asleep. I think the whole experience traumatized me.
It hasn't helped that I have been at home for so long doing nothing basically because of covid. My semester ended like a month ago and I have been at home for like 2 months because of my health stuff. It also doesn't help that I'm going to be going into my last semester of college and don't feel ready to graduate. It feels too scary. I also have a tendency to maladaptive daydream where I am daydreaming about having fun with people I don't even know or making up scenarios that will never even happen. These daydreams still sometimes make me happy, but are now making me sad that I daydream like this at all. I feel like I do it because I am lonely and have norhing to do. Basically I don't want to waste my life and am frusterated that I don't really know what I want to do with it and frusterated and upset that I am not having the best time right now. I could write on and on but will stop there for now and talk to people in the comments. Maybe you don't have a tip and just want to share a similar experience and that is completely fine with me."
655,I'm 27 and I never had romantic relationships,"Should I even try at this point?/Is there a reason to come out?

People say that life and dating after 30 sucks. So I have less than 3 years of normal life left.
I say ""normal life"" but in reality I had severe depression for a long time."
656,I cut again after nearly 5 years of being clean.,"June of this year would of been 5 years from me being clean of self harm.
My thighs are covered in scars and a little on my wrist.

I absolutely hate myself so doing it again. I lost control.

So much has gone wrong in these past few months i couldnt handle the stress anymore. I lost my mom ontop of all that. 

Its been so rough. I hope i dont do it again"
657,How do I connect with my friends when we're both emotionally volatile / set each other off?,"I have a friend who doesn't seem totally self aware about how she affects other people, I don't blame her I don't think she does it intentionally but I have issues with talking to her because even though I appear stable and supportive I'm really not, and I don't have any way of communicating that to her without making it seem like I'm making it about myself or that she's ""too much"" 

tbh her behavior does trigger me sometimes, and I really don't know how to bring it up because when she's going through something I want to be there but then the particular way that she says and does things doesn't mix with me very well and then we're both spiraling which means even if I'm cognizant of that in the moment I'm less likely to be able to explain or act rationally because of dis-regulation. And to her, me turning off my notifications and deleting my social media apps because they're overwhelming for me, reads to her like a personal affront, when it's not personal, it's just the way she is when she's down and the way I am when I'm down are not compatible

It's especially hard to bring up for me because I like to talk to people in person or over the phone, but she prefers to text like 95% of the time, and also just wouldn't be comfortable having a personal or emotional conversation over the phone because she doesn't have a lot of privacy where she lives, I'm really struggling to figure out if I should bridge this with her, or if I should just work on myself so that I'm more prepared for when she's going through the shit so that I can be there and not get triggered

any advice from anyone who has a person that mutually sets them off would be cool, or just anything tbh, feedback or personal experience it doesn't necessarily have to be advice, thanks for reading, sorry for any errors"
658,Absolutely shattered by the seeming realization of the lack of need society has for myself,"Sorry if this is a rant. To be honest I just know that putting these thoughts into words pubically may do enough help for the short-term in itself.   


I spent my growing years eager and ambitious to contribute to society. To help even do 1/1,000,000th of the work within a field to advance us to Mars would be meaningful enough for me. It's the reason I went through further education to recently became an Engineer. Truthfully, it may have been naive to believe that I undoubtedly would be presented a fulfilling career or personal life path upon completion of my time in education. In of which I believed I was spending a part of my life for the greater good (educating/training) to allow myself to then, in turn, be a productive member of society. I truly went into secondary education without any desire for self-benefit, besides the exception of self-fulfilment by becoming a productive member of the society.

Instead, I've found myself unemployed for nearly a year now. I want no pity on this. Clearly, I'm not desirable enough within the marketplace. Thats the harsh reality. My naivety to believe that I was spending my time and money for society has fallen flat on its face. How could I have been filling up the pot of self-betterment for society's sake when clearly I'm not needed in the first place? This wasn't a trade. This was an unnecessary course. I am simply not needed or desired. There are enough of us, and most definitely better candidates that will always exist to do a job I would wish for myself.  


Sadly my dooming pit of despair I've put myself in has done much more self anguish across my life (relationships, wealth management/care, etc) than just in a purely profession-society role. I now feel as if there is no need for myself across any of society. My seeming lack of need had myself flake out of relationships as I found myself lost and didn't want to have others sucked into my dispare, or in turn I myself was flaked upon for my undoubtedly pubicly expressed deprivation of self-worth I had upon myself.

The worst thing is that, I know that no matter what, this is true. Nearly 8 billion people exist. Very rarely does even one of them truly matter enough for all of society to embrace their existence. But I, however, seem not even needed enough to fulfil a role 30 branches below that person on the corporate latter, in a less relevant company, in a much less relevant position. And yet most people that are in my situation and seemingly handle it better than I myself have done so this past year. Not only am I now ever so aware of the lack of my worth; but that I am also even more unable to properly accept these terms, and shouldn't even be considered a functioning member of society on the same level of those that also find themselves unneeded, as I seemingly am losing the ability to even be a functioning member in solely a social sense compared to others in my shoes.  


I now imagine humanity progressing throughout the stars and universe, and being successful in all that exists.  I now imagine a future in which 100% of everything that there is within humanities grasp. And I simply don't care. We could all be snapped away tomorrow to never exist as a species and I would be okay with that. Fuck."
659,Terrified of dying,Hello there I was wondering does anyone have a fear of dying like I do? I’m in my 30s and have a few health problems which will lower my life expectancy by about 20 years and I had find myself constantly fixating on dying and my fear of it. Is this a common thing anyone else experiences? I know that I have many decades left to live my life but the fear of dying still hangs over me every day.
660,"16 year old, daily breakdowns, constant depression.","I am 16 years old, have been addicted to marijuana for 2 years, unhappy whole life.

My earliest memories are those of the same daily recurring feeling. My chest tightens up, i feel cold and naked, i have no sense of self or what i want to do in life and am a daily smoker 3-4 times a day. I cry almost everyday. i just want this hell to end. i cant go on being unhappy, but i cannot form the words to talk to anybody about it, it’s just impossible. i have never had a friend i really trusted and the thought of that makes me sad. i have no friends now. i have done my share of cutting before on my chest and forearms, i hit myself sometime, completely explode verbally , i don’t know what to do man. i cant kick my weed addiction of 2 years or my nicotine addiction. i have experimented with psychedelics and alcohol. i have alcoholic parents but i don’t like alcohol. i like getting stoned like my life depends on it. i wake up everyday, feeling naked, blue and cold, like i have no name, and i think about my 0 friends. i say i’m gonna kill myself all the time. almost everyday. but out of impulse. but it’s everyday. everyday feels like the same waste. i write and play music and that’s really the only center of attention in my life. i sit in my dark strobe lit room all day watching netflix, getting high, maybe playing an hour a day, as opposed to when i didn’t smoke it was 3-4 . but also it would be 3-4 hours when i smoked sometimes too. i’m just sick of feeling like nothing. i have no obligation to anything."
661,My life's a nightmare I can't wake up from,"26 years old, college drop out, complete loner, no girlfriend, shit jobs, no money, all work, no play, ugly, no sex, only fucked one girl and I'm not what girls seem to be attracted to physically (ugly), no one cares so neither do I, my dad and I don't get along because he failed as a father and was unprepared for the emotional hurricane that would come once I got older, I have no friends, everyone tries to fuck me over and get shit our of me, life's a bitch and then you die so maybe I'll just do myself a favor and die sooner. 

Fuck you cruel fucking world"
662,Hypochondria and very weird thoughts,"So I'm in the point where I kinda don't really wanna live anymore and I'm very scared of death at the same time (because there are some people that would be incredibly upset If I was gone). Why? It all started three months ago when I caught covid. I thought I would just get through it and recover well because I'm a young person (17yo). I was sooo wrong.  
 I don't know what happened but one night I started to suffocate ,having a feeling like I'm holding my breath while I breathe normally. This led to strong chills (from stress i guess?), checking oxygen levels on oxymeter every second, checking my blood pressure very often and just trying to survive. Everytime I tried to get some sleep I felt like my body woke me up to save me from dying during sleep. My mom had to stay with me most of the time because I was panicking over my breathing problems so hard that I didn't sleep. I fainted after taking a shower, had problems with speaking because I felt like my face was stiff. I had a really bad time then, I couldn't see a doctor because my symptoms weren't that severe ( I didn't have fever, coughing and all that) and it's very hard to recieve medical help during pandemic in my country (I'm afraid I'd just hear ""Just drink some tea and get some rest"").  
I went through the worst and I hoped it all would be over, but no, it isn't.  
 After all of this I noticed I have another problem - I worry about my health all the time and feel like people around me want to hurt me. I just lost all the trust for others and myself. Now when I eat something that I didn't make myself, my first thought is ""What If the person that cooked this added poison here?"" or I use my shampoo and i think ""What If someone added acid here to hurt me?"".  
That might sound funny,  but these thoughts are genuine and I have them everytime I do anything. These thoughts often trigger placebo effect. I became scared of taking meds (I had no problem with that before) , I'm terrified of every single cramp or slight pain that I experience. I'm just creating the worst scenarios of various health conditions that these small symptomps may announce.

 Few days ago I was in terrible period pain that woke me in the middle of the night, I decided to take a painkiller but something in my head told me to read the package leaflet, that was a mistake. The moment I saw the counter- indication and side effects list I knew I was not gonna sleep that day, I took the pill anyway but cried out of fear. I was never behaving like that before. I experience something like this almost every night.  
I try to work on that issue but I don't know if it's just a mental condition (anxiety? stress?) or a physical problem now (lung damage bc of covid?) . I don't know what to do or is it even curable.   
I have that holding-breath-while-breathing-normally feeling while I'm typing this.  


Sorry for grammar, english isn't my first language."
663,"[update] I (26M) spent the holidays away, my family assumed I killed myself. I had no intentions, don’t know how to feel or face them","I want to cross post this here instead of r/RA to avoid visibility. If this isn’t allowed I understand 

Original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/klme8c/i_26m_spent_the_holidays_away_my_family_assumed_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Know a few people followed me so figured you’d want an update. And to be honest - in my original post I wanted to avoid talking about the root cause of my issues and just my immediate feelings to that situation. So I blamed work, which has been stressful - but a drop in the ocean comparative to long term family issues. 

For context we have 10 siblings. Our upbringing is full of physical  and emotional abuse and neglect. You can see the cracks in all of us, and anyone I’ve trusted to share  things from  our upbringing has always had a look of disbelief followed by, “when was the last time you’ve talked to them? Are they in jail?”. No we talk to them everyday they’re still part of our lives and we pretend like none of it happened

So...I ’m still gone, and the situation sort of spiraled for me mentally. I never wanted to open the can of worms that is acknowledging family issues as I knew there is no resolution. For that reason I knew it was best to go be alone to deal with it.

I know I didn’t owe anyone an explanation for any of my actions but I understood the concern for my well-being (genuine or not) which is why I always made it clear to anyone that asked that I  was “ fine safe and not to worry”. Hoping that they would get the hint to leave me be and would stop the constant barrage of messages from everyone. 

I was wrong though, They only got more and more annoyed demanding I tell them right now how they are worried  and they are concerned. Felt like total bullshit because I told them I was fine and I’ll explain when I’m ready. I honestly wanted to give them a brief explanation  but as I would start typing and deleting thoughts,  I kept getting more and more messages from others and it stressed me the fuck out. So I  told myself again, you don’t owe them anything, put your phone down. But They weren’t happy with this and continued on being more demanding that I owe them an explanation because they are concerned, I owe them that because they are worried. 

This progressed on each day and I started getting messages from people further further from the family, they were telling everyone. This is exactly what I didn’t want to happen, I don’t like being focused on or center Of attention especially regarding my personal issues. I could tell their concern had little to do for me and all to do with the “drama”. Best way I can describe it, it felt like a bunch of paparazzi trying different methods to get the inside scoop with each approach . So each day my anxiety worsened further than it’s ever been before -  it’s always been manageable. It only made me wanna recluse away more and talk less. My original plan was just to take a couple days, sit on the bench for a breather, and then get back in the game. 

It blew up more one night when my mom said(verbatim) “why aren’t u calling we are all concerned you are being selfish by not communicating it’s not fair. I get urngoin thru issues but it doesn’t help not communicating and you not doing what u say u gonna do” (which she means calling them back,  which I didn’t say I would, she just told me I had to earlier and I didn’t respond to it).

At this point I haven’t been able to actually take this time away to chill out (or sleep) like I wanted to because of them so this really set me off and only said back:

“You’re right, I didn’t mean to focus on my own problems, as what you want should always come first. This is about what I very obviously owe you, and less to do with I want or need as that’s not important. And if you think I’m the one being ridiculous then you can understand why I wouldn’t come to you or other family for help.”

She doubled down saying how it’s not fair to them that I don’t tell them where I am. Which I could’ve, but that was completely irrelevant to the situation, literally just drove 4 hours one direction and camped out. 

I said “It’s unfair to think I owe you anything about my whereabouts. I understand everyone’s concern for my safety which is why I’ve made it known since the start that I’m fine and okay and nothing else.”. She only replied with a sarcastic “yea ur not fine dumbass lol”. So I was done, mom blocked, bye.

Yesterday I tried confiding in my older sister who I probably trust the most out of all my siblings, still know she would probably tell everyone in the family despite  asking to keep it between us, she said I could trust her. (spoiler: she told the family). I outlined what I was going through mentally what I think is the cause and the reasons I’m feeling this way. I knew it was a lost cause when her response was essentially, “put yourself in their shoes and imagine how they feel for what they did”, or “do you think you’re overreacting?” I told her that’s exactly the issue; there’s no consideration for our sake even if they fucked up you defend and feel guilty for them...for what they did to US. This is a culmination  of the years of abuse and neglect which WE should somehow feel guilty about?

Turned into an ugly argument about how “we didn’t know better, you can’t blame us as kids for not knowing how to handle it”, which I know! I have never blamed you or anyone for that matter but we can be there and help each other instead of letting them continue to manipulate and abuse us, and right now one of your siblings is dealing with the side effects of this alone because he couldn’t  trust anyone would have his back as you clearly just demonstrated. 

Needless to say, it’s been exhausting I tried finding a therapist, call my insurance and got a list of names in my network and called all of them but they are either retiring or not taking any patients. I don’t know what to do at this point constantly in a panic,  I feel like I’m in fight or flight mode all the time and at this point it’s starting to take its toll. Basically it’s been one long, sleep deprived, isolated anxiety attack that gets prodded every hour or so. Just to be clear suicide is not an option, I won’t let them have that. I know I need help but it’s been a struggle trying to get that for myself. Sorry if this is long winded or unreadable, needed to rant.  Open to any and all advice or feedback . Thanks for listening."
664,The human mind is so weird.,"For the most part of the last three months I would say I’ve been ‘happy’ ish but then out of nowhere it will come crashing down out of nowhere. Why would our own mind basically betray us like that?

I still wake up crazy early from time to time, even if I go to bed late. And I’m just full of anxiety when it happens. There are times when I feel so relaxed and feel so good like everything will be more than ok. 

But then like I had mentioned it will come crashing down out of nowhere. I wish there was a way to just turn it off and be happy. I find when I start to feel anxious I begin to sort of pace around. 

I haven’t cried in a while at least. But maybe I should just let it out. Although I feel like nothing wants to come out even if I am feeling extremely sad and anxious. Just wanted to express what I am currently going through. Thank you and I hope everyone is ok or on the right path to being ok. Love you all."

-even though corona is happening are they taking new patients in?

667,Is a psychologist/therapy to get a prescription from a psychiatrist?,"I want to get adderall for my ADHD from just a psychiatrist where they just check in regularly to make sure everything is going fine. This place i'm about to go to in a few weeks wants me to meet with a psychologist and talk about my feelings and uncover my depression and i don't want to do that. I just want to get the ADHD thing resolved so i can focus on my education.

What do you recommend I do?"

669,How can I become more attracted to girls?,"Long story short I think girls are pretty but very little sexual attraction to them. After running into a guy who was a bit more feminine but overall just a skinny guy I got along with I started having a lot of gay thoughts and thinking about him sexually. I do not feel attracted to 90% of guys but he was an exception and got more attractive to me the more I saw him irl.

I'm really distraught coming to the realization that I might not be straight and that this is why I never seemed interested in the girls I went on dates with. But I don't want this, I want to go back to not realizing this, I don't want gay thoughts, and I absolutely never want anyone to know especially my friends and family who'd never forgive me. Even I'm hating myself for it, I want a wife and to be normal like everyone else what can I do? I tried getting away from porn and nofap but I still can't get these thoughts out of my head and I'm almost crying. Is there any way at all I can train myself to only want girls? I think they're pretty, I look at them when I can but for some reason it just doesn't get me interested. Maybe if I really liked the girl I'd want her more and then these thoughts would get out of my head, I'm really praying for that to be the case and now I want to find a girl I can love soon, I can see myself being intimate with her, it's not disgusting to me so it should be possible right?"
670,Just discovered that old friend works at my therapist's office,"Hello - this is my first time posting so please forgive any formatting/rule issues.


I am living in the US and just moved into my parents' house due to COVID-19. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a few years now, but I could not find the help I needed. I tried a psychiatrist a year or so ago, but he was no help and it was $200 out of pocket to see him. 


I am now on different insurance and struggling with my mental health worse than before (who isn't?), so I decided to try a psychiatrist again. I met with them virtually last week and they prescribed me Prozac. They also suggested I see a therapist as well. I was checking their website to ensure their therapists were covered under my insurance and my heart stopped - one of their therapists is an old friend of mine. 


Of course, I do not plan on using my friend as a therapist - I would use another therapist at this place. However, I have not told ANYONE I am seeing a psychiatrist/therapist and I do not plan to. I do not talk to this friend very often anymore, but we used to be close (I even went to their wedding) and I do not want them to know either. I do not want to change psychiatrists already, but should I? Do other psychiatrists/therapists have access to patient files that are not assigned to them? I am worried and do not know who else to ask about this :("
671,"Failing online classes, can't focus, leave home or find a job","*note: this is a throwaway account. I don't want anyone in my social circle to find out. Social anxiety gets the worst of me.*

Asian here [20M], living abroad in another Asian country. Pursuing a cybersecurity degree.

This is currently the second semester that I'm attending online. Initially, I was alright with all this during the first semester. As the days go by, I grow more and more stressed, anxious and frustrated.

I went from an average grade B student to a complete failure. 

Now, I've had my fair share of failure and successes both in high school and real life. However, this hits different.

The workload has increased immensly over the past few weeks. Heck, we didn't even get a break for the New Year's day or New Year's eve. Classes continued as usual. 

It doesn't help I'm pursuing my degree right now either. My CGPA has been affected horribly, and I'm afraid that my portfolio is completely ruined.

I feel that the institution doesn't care about us students at all, in terms of ourmental health, during these hard times. If anything, we've actually had **more** work to do than regular semesters.

If I recall, we had:

- 4 lab assignments,

- one, two or sometimes three major assignments for *each* subject I'm taking right now (7 subjects, so that is roughly 19 or 20 credit hours)

- mid terms

- and now the finals up ahead

All this is excluding the additional work we get in class on top of all this.

A few of them didnget delayed by about a week, but that made no difference as more than half of it had the same due deadline. 

To make matters worse, some are group projects, and all my group members do are copy other people's work. I mean, personally I don't mind them doing whatever. It's their life. However, plagiarism is a serious offence and I don't want to be kicked out for that... or anyone for that matter, really.

Normally, this workload would have been okay. Right now however, I've become so overwhelmed by all this, and I cannot focus at all. 

I have even stopped playing video games to try and stop procrastinating and focus.

At this point, I think I have a very mild case of ADHD. I've gone as far as to cut down my sugar intake a little and increased my water intake to help. I've had this problem during childhood as well, but nowhere near as bad as right now.

Being Asian, my family doesn't believe this being a possibility, and refuse to bring me for a check up.

I've always been, or at least tried to be very positive even during the darkest points of my life. I've gone through depression twice in high school, and this did help me overcome it myself without asking for help. My family doesn't take it seriously at all, so I did the best I could to get through it.

Every piece of work is graded (carries over as our final grades). There is no leniency for late submissions as far as I'm aware, because all of which I have submitted has been deducted from the scores. 

I understand, these grades don't define who I am in the future, but I still feel that I've wasted my parents' hard earned money. By no means are we wealthy, so I cannot afford to take a gap year. My parents are self-employed and they work very hard back home to cover the costs. They're in their old age now and I do not want to see them suffer anymore.

Attendance is compulsory as well, mostly because I am not a local, and it is a governmental requirement if I want to keep my student visa status.

So far, this has been the toughest semester, even though I've had the previous semester online prior to this.

I've started losing friends as well, since I've been delaying on a lot of work, which could have brought down their grades too. I feel really bad for everyone involved in all this. I appreciate the lecturers for trying to help alongside their own issues as well. The information just doesn't stick with me anymore.

I've still got 4 assignments remaining, all due next week. Even reading feels like a chore. Staring at a screen everyday, hoping I learn something; that's my life right now. Honestly, everyone has been having a tough time, so I understand it is not just myself.

My social life has been a mess, mental health has gone down the drain, and my grades have sunk down deeper than the depths of the swamps of dagobah

I want to get out of this pit I've fallen into. I'm too shy, anxious and ashamed to ask anyone for help because I know them physically. Obviously, this is not helping at all either, and that's my fault.

There cannot be success without failure, but most of society does not view it as such. 

Please don't pity me; I dislike it. I do not normally ask anyone and keep to myself (yes, I'm the silent type). Right now, I don't see a way forward. I just want to know what I can do to help myself. I don't want to drown in all this. It is all very suffocating."
672,Started hearing voices,"About a week ago, something... happened and the next day I started hearing voices. I have bipolar type I disorder. I am taking medication for this. I'm afraid to talk to anyone in my life about it though. I don't want my doctor/therapist to think I need hospitalization because I don't have insurance to be admitted. I don't know if I need to do something or if they'll go away on their own. They are saying some detrimental stuff though and already talked me into buying things I could use to harm myself. Honestly just feeling really lost and could use some advice."
673,how do i approach my mother’s comments on my weight/body?,"over the past year or so, i’ve been struggling with my relationship with my mom. i am a sophomore in college, and last year i lost about 10 pounds due to the stress of my freshman year. when i came back home in march, my parents were concerned (i am now about 7ish pounds underweight) and i immediately was put on a diet to gain weight. personally, i consider myself to be a healthy person. i eat 3 meals a day, i exercise. i do not restrict, although i do prefer to eat healthily (however you define that). i get enough sleep, i prioritize myself, and take care of my mind and body. over the course of a few months of the diet, i didn’t gain any weight, and so i just came to the conclusion that this is how my body looks right now. despite taking measures to take care of myself, my mom will tell me she observes VASTLY different  things about my mental and emotional health. 
one day it will be: “you look so strong. i can tell you put on muscle. you carry yourself better. i’m proud of you”
and then LITERALLY the next day she will say: “are you suicidal? your clothes hang off of you. you are skin and bones. we need to take you to see a nutritionist and you need to gain weight”
this cycle has continued almost every week since i have been home to the point where i don’t even know what my true mental state is, or if i look healthy or sickly anymore. i’ve tried to be open in telling her how i feel, but no matter what i say, the comments about my body and mind keep coming. it’s been hard on how i view my body as well as how i manage emotions. admittedly, i have endured a low-grade depression due to the pandemic and being away from college, but nothing that is abnormal for a college student living during this time. what should i do? it’s getting hard to manage this different perception of me on a daily basis-it’s to the point where i don’t know how i should feel about myself until my mom tells me how i should feel."
674,I feel like I'm going to kill myself soon.,"I'm a fucking joke. I'm bad at math, spelling, and writing. Like if auto correct didn't exist, I'd be in trouble. I'm also pretty bad at talking to people. I can't form friends or connect with people, especially with women. If I can form a connection with a female, I'll  tend to get attached to them. Even if they're just being nice. 

I'm in my late 20's and I'm still living with my family. I dropped out of school after changing career paths 6 times. I feel like I will never make more than 30K and I also feel like no woman will never love me. I'm ugly as fuck. I'm short, skinny, I have a lazy eye, small dick, a fat nose, birth marks, moles and splotches all over my body.  I'm gonna end it soon. I just know it. Tbh I just don't think I was meant to live this long. I've been depressed for years, I've read books and have also gone to therapy, but none of that shit has helped me much."
675,Mental Health Foundation - Run,"Well.... it’s time to get our running shoes on!

The great folks over at *Mental Health Foundation* have MANY charities in all sorts for running events such as **marathons**, **5k’s** and more. 

With how the world currently is, we may or may not be able to attend these events, due to COVID. So, the *Mental Health Foundation* have not promoted any events for the near future, as of right now. In 2020... the events went as followed: 

- Virtual Run 2020 
- London Landmarks Half Marathon
- 2020 Virtual Edinburgh Marathon 
- Ultra Challenge Series 

To take part and get involved within the marathon’s and virtual runs/series, it costs nothing! But, the minimum sponsorship would cost up to £100. By paying this, you’ll be running with the sponsor(s) on your kit/vest/shirt! 

As I said, with how the world currently is... I highly suggest you do the **Big Fun Run**. The Big Fun Run (or BFR) is all about staying active, keeping fit and healthy and enjoying yourself while doing so. Yes, keeping fit and running for a few miles can be tiring and stressful, but it’s all about taking part and having some fun. To get involved, it doesn’t matter if you’ve just begun road-running or a professional that’s competed in 100’s of marathons around the world, it’s available to **EVERYONE**! 

The Mental Health Foundation has an aim for everyone... 5k. That’s it! 5k is about... 3 miles, perhaps? Now listen, it’s not a competition at all. You can complete this in 10 minutes or 10 hours, it doesn’t matter, enjoy yourself while you do it and take your time. 

I have already done this challenge... while you’ve done so... take a picture of yourself (no matter how tired or sweaty you are!) and do the following... 

- Run 5k
- Donate £5/$5/€5 (wherever you live)
- Tag 5 friends

So... as it says, you’ve just ran **5k**, as it’s a run for Mental Health, you can donate to *ANY* Mental Health charity of YOUR choice and after you’ve done so, take a picture of yourself with 5 fingers up and tag 5 of your friends to compete in the challenge! 

If you want an idea of what I’m describing, here’s a photo of me finishing this challenge in April 2020!

677,TW I dont know how to cope anymore,"Tw for suicidal thoughts, self harm

I dont know how to get better. I feel so numb rn. I found some of my old medication earlier and i havent stopped thinking about it since. I really wanna take them. Theres no particular reason i just really cant get them out of my mind. I go through days where i just feel fine then other days i wanna die. I know this isnt normal but ive tried meds and therapy and nothing helps. Im about three weeks clean from self harm but idk if i can get through tonight. Why do i just keep feeling like life isn't worth living???"
678,Feel like my brain is dead after eye surgery,"Hi guys, I did a eye laser surgery 3 months ago. Since that day, I feel like my brain is dead. Nothing is happening in my head. I can’t even talk to myself anymore. During the day, I’m not doing anything. I had to stop school after the surgery because of that situation. It is because I had stress attack because of the surgery or a trauma. Please help! I cannot live like that anymore. I really feel like my brain is completely dry! Thank you a lot people."
679,What are the biggest problems in mental health?,"I know this is a very broad question, and so happy to see wherever it goes! 

If I have to be more specific tho I guess I'm thinking most in terms of general challenges faced by patients (most common threads if there are any across different diagnoses) and challenges for therapists to treat them.

Also, any perspectives from patients would be great to know about - specific challenges in getting treatment, following through etc :)"
680,I feel like I've lost my closest friends,"This is going to be long so if some of this has bad grammer, I apologize, I'm on mobile and its late where I live.

I few months ago, back when my last school year ended in June, I didn't really contact some or my close friends at the time from covid hitting my school district in March, and then to June. They people I was friends with were like a second family to me, and with me not really able to contact them because I didn't have any of their numbers, was depressing, especially when I was locked in my house 24/7 by my dad(Teacher). All the school work qe got was easy and there was no zoom calls to go on to until this year. The people I talked to every day that year, seamed to fade away, and I don't see any of them because of the new school year. We were able to meet in the front area of our school building and talk until the first bell, but the school says we need to go to our first class of the day Imani when we get in, no standing around talking to friends. And that's the main reason I'm making this post. Because of this, the few friends I had last year are gone, I have zero classes with them, and I can't even talk to them. They were my everything, especially when one I had a crush on and brightened up my day just seeing her. I feel so alone and like I don't have close friends anymore, and I just want someone to talk to, some to be my shoulder to cry on. This year sucked, but before covid, in January and February, at least I could talk to them about my time in the hospital (Heart stuff not covid), I felt like they cared. Now, I don't see anyone caring besides my parents.  I feel so alone, I just want a hug."
681,I am AFRAID of the number 4. Specifically when the clock strikes 4:44 when I manage to catch a glimpse of it.,"I’m even shaking while typing this.

I know it sounds ridiculous. I’ve been suffering from anxiety, minor Tourette’s, and depression for a long time but this was something I had a hard time putting into words for my psychologist and close friends... so I wanted to see if anyone else shares a similar obstacle. 

It started off when I was younger when 4 is culturally a number or bad luck (means ‘death’). I guess my parents never freaked out when it came up, but they just kept telling me to stay away from it as best I can/ don’t pick that number when you have other choices/ buy three or five gifts instead, etc.

I’m in my late 20s now and my heart still jumps when I accidentally see it on my clock, on a price tag, on Spotify etc. And usually when I do manage to catch I feel a bad omen shrouding me. Tumultuous events await me today or the next couple days. That’s why I try my best to avoid all screens around 4:43.

Just yesterday, I saw it on my dashboard and when I came home, my gf’s mother freaked the hell out. Says she couldn’t sleep, the upstairs neighbours are loud as hell, and she wants me to think about marriage with her daughter since she’s been seeing me more often. 

Sounds ridiculous? I know, but it sure doesn’t change my feeling towards it no matter how much “logic” I put into it. I keep saying to myself these events are coincidences. Maybe the bad omen feeling sets me up to put extra defensive and vulnerable. 

Anyone have a similar obstacle playing mental gymnastics with yourselves for no logical reason. Any things you’ve done to help it?"
682,"Something bad has been happening and I only just realized, and I have a question for what to do","I realize I’ve been losing weight. Not with a scale, haven’t weighed myself in forever, but visibly my stomach is not pronounced and you can see my ribs a lot more. Before anyone thinks this, I don’t have an eating disorder. My body is actually one of the things I like about myself. But stress has been plaguing me non stop and I barely get out of bed, my main diet being coffee and a little bit of dinner at most everyday. I’ve also been staying up late, and getting up at around the middle of the day. So, does anyone have any advice on how to get myself to eat more?? I don’t want to feel sicker then I already do, and I know eating properly can help me feel a bit better"
683,I need help..*trigger warning*,"I'm Kiara. 

The other day my sister and I had a seafood party at our house and she invited the other sister who hasn't spoken to her in 3 months because when the sister who wasn't talking to my other sister was in the hospital we confronted her boyfriend about being emotionally abusive toward her. She denied everything and I knew from the start that yesterday was going to be a terrible day. 

After the one sister left and everyone pretended to be happy and get along, I drank an entire bottle of champagne and then took some fireball shots and got drunk. 

After I got drunk I was outside stumbling about and my neighbor came outside and started talking to me. He told me I was pretty and he liked me and I said well thank you just being nice though I don't find him attractive. I don't remember a whole lot Bc I was drunk but we went out back of my house and he started kissing me and stuff and he reached his hand down my pants and started touching me and I got really uncomfortable it hurt really bad but I didn't say anything I just let it happen Bc I was drunk and mad it’s my fault I shouldn’t have been drunk.....I'm tired of trying to be perfect all the time.."
684,sooo school is starting again tmrw,im absolutely dreading it like more than i should be. im already failing a class since i gave up on doing the work a long time ago. im more than sure im going to have to retake the class next year. i know im not alone but i actually detest online school now it’s just another freaking bad thing to add on to the already big list of bad things going on rn.
685,My Mental State Is Severely Deteriorating,"I'm a 19-year-old female who has struggled with mental health most of my life. I have been diagnosed with OCD, BPD, and MDD. When I was a child I was convinced people were watching me through hidden cameras, reading my thoughts, following me, and trying to poison me. Because of this, I wouldn't eat foods unless it was packaged and I opened it myself. The older I got, the less severe these thoughts were. With the disorders I was diagnosed with, my medication was working and I was doing really well. Anyway, I feel myself slipping more and more into an unhealthy mental state. I have the same thoughts I had as a child and even though I try to tell myself they are just thoughts, I can't completely shake them. They have ruined my relationships. I can't get out of bed. When walking alone, I can hear footsteps and people following me on bicycles. I often see people in my room that vanish when I look again. Sometimes, I hear people whispering and walking around my room. Deep down, I know that my brain is just working against me, but it's getting harder to distinguish between what is just my brain and what is reality. I am in a constate state of fear and sometimes it feels like my entire body is turned into stone and this feeling of dread comes over me. It feels like my lungs are going to explode and all I can do is lay there for around 30min-1 hour until the feeling goes away I was recently hospitalized and they changed my medication. I took myself off the medication and I've been yo-yo-ing the consistency at which I take it ever since. For reference, I was on 100mg of Zoloft with 2mg of Abillify. The hospital changed me to just 150mg of Zoloft, despite me telling them that Zoloft has never worked for me when it is not partnered with Abillify. I took myself off of it and started taking 50s again after a few weeks of not taking anything bc my mental state was not looking good. The intent was to go back to 100mg with the 2mg of Abillify after a month. I've been on and off it, frequently skipping days. I feel like this could be a reason, but I am not sure. I feel like this could be a reason, but I don't know a lot about medication, so I'm not sure. Sorry this was so long."
686,I’m too depressed to get up,"Diagnosed with an assortment of disorders, I am now to exhausted and done to get up. I desperately want to workout but simply standing seems to be too much for me right now. All I do is eat and regret it and cry and want to injure myself. I’m not sure if I want consolation or advice but everything hurts right now and I don’t know why. I keep binging and regretting it and I’m going to really hate myself if I keep putting on weight. I’m fighting sh urges and I just want everything to stop."
687,kinda a sad rant but i need to vent,"TW: 

there are a lot of things going on in my life atm. family issues, my own mental health and my grandma. i can barely get out of bed anymore 

for context: i have ptsd, major depression, anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder 

my family has been emotionally and verbally abusive my whole life and i’m stuck with them again because of covid. 

my mental health has gone down the drain, i’m not able to have access to a therapist atm and i’ve been sh ing again. (i’m trying to stop) 

i was told my grandma only has a few days left until she passes.. her nursing home doesn’t allow visitors due to covid so she is in there all alone.. i just wanna say goodbye"
688,I feel like I have to be white to be pretty..,"I’ve been insecure about my appearance for years because I compared myself to others but I didn’t think I’d be insecure about my skin color. It seems hard to explain, and I feel like the only one. White has been represented as what’s mainly beautiful for ages.. part of me just can’t help it. I’ll cry sometimes because I can’t be a lighter complexion or something.."
689,Drowning in thoughts,"Honestly I, I just want to sleep its late for me nearly 3 am and school will start in 5 hours and I am trying to I am listening music anything. I can't my thoughts are just getting more and more and it aren't good thoughts it are thoughts that just worsen how I feel...

It is as if I am gasping for air because I am drowning with the only difference that I am not drowning in water but instead in  thoughts, thoughts that destroy me and also its not really air im gasping for but mental health"
690,I'm struggling,I just moved out of home around a month ago after living with my mum for 20 years. I didn't have the best relationship with my mum as she was quite manipulative and mean to me. ever since i've moved it has felt a lot better as even though she still continues to contact me i feel like i'm better able to block this out. Even so i am still struggling with this and i'm not sure what i want my relationship with her to look like going forward. Now that i'm not living there anymore i've been told i don't have an excuse to be sad and anxious. I feel guilty for leaving my mum but also now that i've found more time for myself I was hoping to work on me. Instead i'm finding that i'm still an anxious wreck and I hate myself more and more each day because of it. I'm trying to make time for myself but i find whenever i do i just feel worse because i find more that i dont like about myself. I am becoming a burden on my friends and i just feel so stuck. I'm starting a new job and a new course this year and i'm living independently but still i find myself feeling the need to gain validation from other people because I can't do it for myself. It's at the point where i don't want to go to social events anymore because i feel like i am ruining everyone else's good time.  I just feel like I don't know how to move forward or even just be proud of myself. this probably makes no sense but i just wish i had someone i could talk to without feeling like i'm being overdramatic or annoying other people and my therapist is never available. how do i not feel like this and stop hating myself?
691,How do I stop myself from cutting my arms?,I use it to release stress and distract me from my depression. I also mildly like the taste of blood. How can I stop myself?
692,I want to get help,"Hello, I was planning on making an appointment to my doctor, and telling them that I think I'm depressed and then saying why I think I'm depressed.

But the problem is that I have not told anyone about my mental health problems at all. Like I usually just tell my parents the physical symptoms instead of saying that I have a really low mood and suicidal thoughts and I usually just tell my 'friends' (they are not really my friends) that I'm good if they think somethings wrong. Even if I go to my doctor on my own then my parents will be notified by the doctor that I'm depressed and then they will ask me bunch of questions and they will be quite insensitive and they will probably tell the rest of my family and their friends that I'm depressed. I'm a very reserved person and I don't want anyone - friends or family or strangers, to know I'm depressed. I also rarely show emotions and the only reason I want to get help is because it's affecting my performance at school and my productivity. 

So how should I do this?"
693,"Im not sure where to post this because im new to reddit, but i need help making a decision.","So i'm currently 14, and i was born in malaysia, but i moved to the US  when i was 5. My grandmother and my grandfather from Malaysia are now trying to force me to come back to malaysia because they want  me to live with them. Ever since this has started happening, my mother has become very cold and angry at me. She says things like ""I know you're not happy here, so why don't you just move back"", and other things similar to that. This has been making me very stressed, my grades have dropped, (from B+'s to D's and F's) and I have been stress eating and have been thinking about suicide.

694,My friend is going to run away,Recently my friend has been having thoughts of running away currently we are sitting here in a discord talking about his feelings about running away right now he has been learning how to live primitively recently he has gotten really good at it and thinks he is gonna go soon he is 13 btw we have talked alot about how he is gonna go I cant do anything more to help him I have done my best all I can do now is sit here and be there for him I need help ASAP
695,Im sick of it all,"Im currently in my basement crying my eyes out because of all the shit im going through right now. No one except my sister understands because shes in the same hole as i am. Im a junior in high school which is stressful enough as it is, with covid and everything. 

Im the average high school depressing dickhead who isnt going anywhere in life. I fucking hate everything and the only things i do love are slowly fleeting. I mean hell, we’re gonna put MY dog down tomorrow because of how sick she is. I already plan on dropping out and getting a GED but everything still fucking sucks

I mean im living with my grandparents because of how bad it is at my house. And im for some reason, expected to be on my A game for school when a lot of shit (that wont be mentioned) is going on. I know i dont have the worst life, but it has to be pretty bad when every second of the day i think about downing a bottle of pills. Right? Ive already had 2 suicide attempts and my sister 1. I dont see the fucking point anymore. I dont have a safe space and everything is becoming as pointless as all hell. 

Im constantly being braided about grades when i keep on doing my shit. Its like, when i dont do schoolwork i get yelled at, but when i do my work i still get yelled at. I dont see the fucking point anymore."
696,My dads dying from covid,"I just got back from the hospital, they allowed us into the hospital tonight night to say goodbye to my dad. He’s a father of 4. I’ve been caring for him as I watched him deteriorate before having to wave goodbye in an ambulance. He has parkingsons disease already and caught several infections alongside covid. They called me today to say he’s got 4% chance of making it. I still have hope it’s going to get better and tomorrow start showing improvement. 

A doctor never came to spoke with us. There are no staff in the ward. They converted the children’s ward into a covid ward. I’m scared they’re giving up on him because he’s old and disabled. This is a REAL PERSON and he was living his life and not ready to fucking die. He was terrified when I called the paramedics. I don’t want him to die alone."
697,I literally don't have any talent," Im 22 and i dunoo to do anything. I can't sing, dance, play, cook, drew, act, ride on bicycle or program things on the computer.

699,Post vacation sadness?,"I (F21) just got back today from a nine day trip with my boyfriend and his family. I had such a great time. Just the company was wonderful and I don’t spend a ton of time day to day with my boyfriend, so it was great to spend so much time with him. 

Then on top of it, his family/their vacation home is nice. Not fancy, but the essentials are perfectly met. They have a normal bed- my bed at home is broken/slanted. Normal bedroom- bedroom at home is really small &amp; painted awfully due to my cousin previously staying here. Normal smelling - my house smells like pot 24/7 due to another family member. 

I’m not trying to make my life sound so sad or bad, because I’m truly very grateful to get to live where I do and rent free with grandparents that love me. 

I’m just kind of struggling to perk up and move on. I just wanna take that my trip was fun, I had a good time &amp; feel happy about what a nice time I had. 

Tips?"
700,"Please don't tell me to ""talk to a professional""...","I'm on mobile so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues, etc. Throwaway account, yadda yadda yadda.

I'm devastated right now and I just need to vent out my frustrations.

I (24F) have been going through a rough patch recently. I was diagnosed with PTSD in September resulting from a previous three year long abusive relationship.

Ever since I started counseling I've been working on myself and becoming more confident in who I am as a person because I'm finally being given the opportunity to work through my problems in a safe environment.

I've been dating my boyfriend (27M) for a little over six months now. He's been incredibly supportive of me throughout this entire journey, and has been open and understanding as I slowly wade into this world of new beginnings and healthy environments.

All that being said, I'm currently stuck in a rut right now where I am beginning to hate the job that I currently work at, and I am desperately trying to find a new job so that I can get out of this work environment that is making me absolutely miserable.

As things at work get worse, my Sunday's have become 24 long hours of me absolutely dreading my return to work on Monday morning, and today has been no different. I did not sleep last night and I laid in bed crying because it was Sunday and my four day weekend was coming to an end.

I spent the day in a mental rut, and I didn't foresee myself feeling any better throughout the day despite my boyfriend's best attempts at trying to cheer me up. As the night comes to a close, my brain begins to play tricks on me and really gets me feeling low. I couldn't find a single thing to do to end the night that I enjoy doing. It was as though everything that typically brings me joy, wasn't even sparking any interest whatsoever.

I mindlessly said out loud to myself, ""what is one supposed to do when nothing they love brings them any joy anymore?"". To which my boyfriend elected to respond with ""uh, talk to a professional"". This comment is very much not like him, because he knows that telling me to ""get help"" is incredibly counterproductive for me, and I wasn't even thinking that he would respond because I was moreso talking to myself, and I didn't even realize he was listening.

I know I shouldn't be, but I am crushed right now. I've spent months trying to make progress in my life, and I feel like I've come very far from where I was, but to know that my boyfriend's go to response was to essentially tell me to ""get help"" really has me upset.

Maybe it's just because I'm really dreading work tomorrow, but allinall, I feel worse now than I did thirty minutes ago before any of that transpired...

Sorry for the rant, I really needed to get this off my chest... u_u"
701,Is it normal to not be able to sleep?,"I don't know if this matters but i'm 13f.
So it's 3:33am right now and i tied sleeping since 0:30 but i just can't sleep. As soon as i start to fall asleep i just see something odd or hear something odd that wakes me up instantly. Didn't watch any horor movies or similar things recently. I don't have acess to mental health profesionals bc of my parents. Is this a symtom of a specific mental illness or a sign of unresolved trauma or something?"
702,How do I start therapy,"I really want to I just genuinely don’t know how to start. Do I need a referral? How do I find a therapist I’m going to get along with? I’m struggling right now and I want to take responsibility for my mental health, I’ve just never done this before. I’m 22 and on my parents insurance. I’m just worried it’s gonna be really expensive if my insurance doesn’t cover too much tho. Any tips would be great! Thank you &lt;3"
703,"Should I check if I have other mental health issues like ADHD, autism or manic depression?","I'm feeling hesitant asking this since the obvious answer might be ""yeah, duh. Why wouldn't you check if you have other problems?""

The thing is, if I had other problems, I am functioning well enough to do day-to-day activities and finding joy in where I am in life. I do have depression and anxiety. I am seeing my therapist less (since I'm feeling pretty good overall) and have been off meds. I sometimes go back on prozac when my depression gets worse during the winter. I am more self-aware of changes in my mood, and I am often able to identify symptoms instead of defaulting to ""I'm just a lazy and emotional piece of garbage."" I've been there and had suicidal thoughts in the past- being in a toxic work environment pushed me over the edge.

Having said all of that, I remember my therapist asking me early-on if I identify with ADHD, autistic or manic depression symptoms. Medication for mental health is the absolute worst, and I know from friends and students that some ADHD meds mess with your sleep. Lack of sleep will definitely make me relapse, and I'm absolutely NOT risking that. So, I've been saying none of the symptoms resonate with me, and I am content with my life... so, I don't want to potentially be diagnosed with the wrong thing and get seriously depressed or have meds making my current situation worse.

But I get curious. So I sometimes take those brief online quizzes that don't really mean much saying I may have autistic tendencies or I may have super mild ADHD and I should get it checked out. But the thing is, I'm functioning just fine now, and it could just be my annoying personality mixed in with my depression/anxiety. Just some things I've noticed from quizzes:

\-I have depressive episodes, but I also have times where I'm hyper-focused and get so much productive work done. I'm super motivated, and I mostly identify it as part of my ""normal healthy"" personality, but it's possible it means something else.  
\-Routines help me, and constant schedule changes have impacted my mood swings. I am able to adjust though, so I feel it's just me being slightly stressed out with some work-related inconveniences.  
\-To this day, there are times where my mom scolds me with ""why would you do xyz... what made you think xyz was a good idea... etc."" We've talked about my mom taking her stress out and has apologized, but there are times where I do make decisions that make me later feel ""Huh. I actually don't know why I thought that was the best solution.""  
\-I blamed depression and my cycle for this, but I sometimes get super emotional over the tiniest things. I will sob and cry. I later realize I blowed things out of proportion.

\-This contradicts with my depression, but I've had narcissistic attitudes before. I mentally shut them down though, because I hate it.

\-I zone out of conversations A LOT. Even with my boyfriend (he knows it's not intentional). I hate small talk. I hate eye-contact and feel awkward about it. As someone who has taught autistic kids I will say I LOVE HUGS AND CUDDLES though. Eye contact with my students and really close friends are fine. I can look at my boyfriend all day and creep him out though.

\-I am terrified of getting in trouble or confrontation, so I often make things worse by avoiding situations instead of facing them face-on. I've gotten better with this, and this is more related with my anxiety and past work trauma. I've had phone/email anxiety, but I'm able to check both now with some breathing. I get anxious if I have unchecked notifications- the feeling never goes away until I check it.

\-When I'm bored, I get really irritated. I think this is normal though. I can sit still if I'm hyper-focused. Otherwise my mind will wander, and I will get out of my chair.

\-It takes me a long while to calm down after an argument or feeling angry. I think this is normal, but I noticed after a stupid argument with my boyfriend, I was still mad after making up. In my head, I was content with the outcome, but I was still mad for some reason. I was given extra time to calm down, since my bf knows how I function. I still don't get why I was upset if the problem was resolved.

\-When I'm fixated on something or find a new interest, it's hard to do anything else. I'm able to currently give myself ultimatums and limits such as setting alarms, snack awards, and to-do lists. Sometimes I have obsessive thoughts. I like organizing my belongings, and I can do it a whole day (during winter break haha) and forget about eating. I can't focus on things I don't like for prolonged periods of time. 

\-This annoys my mom, so I'm trying to fix this and getting better at moving on. I check constantly if I have certain things (such as my phone, wallet, etc.) I check if I locked the door after I just locked it. After groceries, I check multiple times if everything is bagged. Strangely, I have left and lost things before. I'm scared of forgetting things, so I have a billion post-its all over my desk. I've had my brain checked for memory loss concerns, but nothing came up.

\-I can't handle vague things. I need a specific time or plan. My boyfriend is spontaneous, so we're both finding middle ground (and it has helped me try to ease up on some things). I need deadlines. I need goals. Do I always meet them? No, but I'll never do anything if it's not planned out.

\-This is probably normal, but when I listen or be with people who are struggling or hurt, I get emotional with them. When I'm with stressed out/angry people, I get super stressed out. I wish this applies to when people are having fun (such as at parties), but I'm awkward and this doesn't work out. Once I know people well-enough, I can talk a lot about things I like (too much). I do have communication issues with my bf, but I'm working on it- I just avoid potential conflicts too easily.

It could be something. It could be nothing. Who knows?"
704,I Just Need to talk,"I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub but I really don’t know where to put this. 

I just feel lost in my life right now. My girlfriend left me recently after 2 years, I’m failing my 5th year of high school, I have a feeling my job is gonna fire me, I have no clue or idea what I want to do in college or a job or anything. Nothing is going right for me right now and I just hurt all the time.

707,"I accidentally hit my dad, but I didn’t feel guilty in the beginning? What’s wrong with me?","A few weeks ago, I hit my dad in the face with a plastic water bottle. I’ve accidentally hit him before because we play fight but never in the face. That day I hit him, my first reaction was to smile and giggle it was a conscious reaction, it’s the first reaction i had, after I noticed this I snapped myself out and forced myself to feel guilty, (if you can even call how I felt that) it was more like a mask, like I was just acting the part. I notice this a lot with my emotions that they don’t feel genuine most of the time. I scared myself though when I felt myself smile. I haven’t had any play fights with him since then. I’m just scared."

709,Horror movie lover since grade 6 - negatively impact my mental health?,"I’m 14 years old and have been a horror film lover since I was 11. I used to be scared of EVERYTHING. Even despicable me 2 scared me when I was 7. I wanted to get over it so I’ve been non-stop watching horror movies. I got over my fear of them after increasing the scare-scale and now I can watch them no problem. 

I’m a huge fan of slow burn art house horror Films like hereditary and the witch, which I found to be disturbing. Today I watched Perfect Blue with my mom, and she said “why do you like this stuff?” And made me instantly paranoid. Im a massive hypochondriac and I’ve noticed myself being very angry lately (not always the case) and I’m worried now that the three years of watching horror has made me desensitised to emotion and compassion. I’m freaking out.

I did recently watch Your Lie In April, and I cried, so maybe I’m fine, but could someone tell me if these horror movies are negatively impacting my brain. They’re something I’m very passionate about but I’m worried I could be harming myself."
710,How to properly be there for someone with mental illness,"My older sister she’s three years older then myself and I honestly love her to death I saw
her go from being such a light In everyone’s life always happy smiling just someone who thought was happiness in human form she went from that to never talking, never leaving her room, she wouldn’t shower for days at a time,
she seemed to blow up over little things,
she was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia a year ago she became a totally different person she refuses to take her medication no one wants to be around her which makes me feel bad I try to be there for her and just sit with her I’m scared she’ll end up committing suicide recently she’s been talking how pointless life was and no one loves a mentally ill person it’ll be better off if she wasn’t around and how she wants to get better but it’s hard I love my sister I just want some advice how I can be there for her without being to pushy and bothersome I don’t want to lose her. ❤️"
711,Am I obsessed with not wasting things? Hoarding?,"I've recently realised I'm kinda obsessed with using up things.

For example, say I have 10 pairs of socks. I only use the ugliest 2 pairs because I really want them to get holes so I can throw them out. 

Another example, I have 5 books. Even though I might not like one of them I'll read it so I can give it away. Even though instead I could give it away without wasting my time reading it?

Another example, I have shampoo that I really don't like. It's not expensive, I could easily throw it away and get one that I do like. Instead, I force myself to use it until it's gone then feel so relieved when I can finally get a new one.

I'm not poor or overly environmentally conscious or anything like that. Is this some form of hoarding? I feel like I waste so much energy doing this."
712,Does anyone know what happened to the app Youper? (On Android),"Recently I tried to look for it since it seemed to get uninstalled from my phone quite recently. The play store didn't seem to have it. I did try to look for it on Google and found the page via the web browser. If I try to download it, there is an error that says ""The item isn't available."" 

...Is there a reason why it's not showing up for me? Or is the app itself completely off the app store?"
713,Need advice - I keep making rash decisions and being hurtful towards my bf (20F/21M),"Hey, so this one's probably going to be a little long. I've been dating my boyfriend for 5 months now and we generally get along well, laugh a lot, and are very affectionate with each other. He's a really sweet guy with good morals and just overall a stand-up guy. He hardly ever gives me reason to be annoyed or angry, and if he does, it's usually because I get butthurt rather than because it's something actually bad that he does. 

I was living for him for the last 5-6 weeks because it made more sense between COVID and getting my own place in January, and just for fun, too. We didn't fight a lot, but the few times we did, it was because of me.

Last time, I told him he wasn't putting enough effort into the relationship when I felt like he wasn't planning things with me when I was trying to plan things with him, but he was depressed that week and took it as an affront and as me not giving him space to be depressed. I felt like a total bitch afterwards, even though I had originally felt like it was an ongoing thing.

The time before, I intentionally didn't tell him who I was on the phone with, but said that I'd been on the phone with someone and that there's drama and I'm glad I'm not involved. Usually I'm pretty open about who I'm talking to. Only reason I didn't say who it was is bc it was a guy who I'd made out with before (everything's platonic now) and we'd had a conversation about him recently and I didn't want to rekindle it. He ended up unhappy that I was being vague that time and the day after about an impulsive decision I was making (I wanted to surprise him with new piercings), and talked to me about why he's upset. But I got angry at the way he was talking to me when he was upset, and ended up writing him an 8-page letter back that said some hurtful things and pushed him away. He was also hurt that I didn't move things around for his bday ahead of time, waiting for the week before to find someone to take over my shift, while others had planned ahead. That I didn't respect his time.

This time, we spent the day unloading my things from moving, then I had work, and then he came to pick me up. But I texted him I'm done and he said he just left, so I decided to get a ride to my new place from a co-worker and chill there for a bit, even though it takes less that 12 minutes to get to my work from his place at that time of day and takes like 7 minutes to get to my new place. I only went bc I was excited for it. We took a long way and got there at the same time he did, but my coworker wanted to see my place and I kept my bf waiting. He was understandably annoyed, and I apologized in the car. I asked if he still wanted dinner (no) or ice cream (no). When we got home he said he's gonna call a friend (apparently the call had been planned, but I didn't know until later), so I packed the rest of my stuff. I started feeling a mixture of guilt and not being wanted there and I also just wanted to be at my new place, but I didn't admit that to myself bc I felt bad for wanting to be somewhere else. After an hour and a half of listening to him walk around and talk to his friend on the phone, I grabbed my backpack and left. I didn't leave a note or anything. I didn't want him coming back to me in a good mood after talking to his friend.

When I got home, I texted my friend. Then later I called w him and apologized and said I knew it was wrong after I left. Truthfully, I knew during, too. We didn't really hang up on good terms. We talked again on the phone the next day and I came over and we talked in person. He felt that I disrespected his time when he picked me up, and brought in that I'm late from work a lot but it's a pizza place job so that's not rly on me. He feels that I didn't give him space to be annoyed at me for even 10 minutes, and that I have a need to feel happy from him talking it out with me when he's annoyed. And then leaving made that go out the window, and he was worried at first, but then he got mad at himself for worrying about me. The last thing he said in that conversation was ""do what you want, but don't drag me through it"". I was still upset about the way he talks to me when he's upset, but he said it was warranted... And I guess it was. Idk.

Realistically, I just wanted to be at my place. But I also wanted to be with him. I originally wanted to spend time with him that last night and was upset that he wanted to call his friend, but I also didn't communicate that I wanted to do something with him ahead of time. I should've turned around when the bus driver drove past me when I tried to leave. I don't know what came over me and why I couldn't admit the real motives for my actions and why I didn't leave a note, especially when I usually leave notes all over the place saying I love him or other random things. Idk why I felt the need to have the last word and couldn't handle that he was just annoyed at me for a good reason.

I'm tired of hurting him, and I'm even more tired of snapping back at him when he's upset with me for a good reason. I feel like he'll see that my good qualities aren't worth putting up with my antics and impulses and won't want to be with me. It makes me really sad seeing him lose trust in me time and time again. Especially when he doesn't do this to me.

I just want some feedback on what I can do to better control my impulses and talk myself back into rationality. I have a lot of impulses that I do control, but sometimes they take over like this. He has ADHD and I'm not diagnosed but I have a lot of symptoms and I've been prescribed adderall. So he gets it about impulsivity and everything else, really. But I'm trying to work on it and don't want to use this as an excuse.

At the end of the day, I love him and I really don't want to hurt him, but I keep losing control and hurting him. Maybe I've been lacking a sense of control in other areas of my life and getting that will help me stop acting out. Anyway, I'd love to hear ideas. This is also a relationship advice post, but please help!"
714,Medication intolerance,"I have dealt with depression for years and anxiety and OCD for basically all my life. I have my anxiety and OCD under control for the most part without meds but depression is something I haven't been able to manage thought therapy and other means. 

I have been on many different medications, SSRIs, SNRIs, and atypical antidepressants. All of them have shown efficacy in improving depressive symptoms but they have all induced severe insomnia as a major side effect which after some time undoes any progress I make with them. I don't have bipolar disorder so they aren't inducing mania, they all just disturb my sleep. 

My psychiatrist wants to put me on an antipsychotic because I can't tolerate any of the antidepressants but I'm just not comfortable taking that class of meds. 

I just want to know if anyone has ever had a similar experience to me with antidepressants?"
715,How many of you run a business with mental health?,"I take alot of mental health days and because of this i cant work for an employee.  I would just get fired.

Im working on my own now as an electrician. My brother also works with me.  If i need a day off,i just take a day off. 

I never wanted to work on my own, but im kind of forced to work on my own now."
716,test anxiety (i think),"So idk if this IS test anxiety but im not so sure if its normal either, i don't wanna claim to have test anxiety if it isn't. i know its normal to get nervous before a test but i get so panicked at the mere thought of taking one, i have this like pain(?) in my chest and i feel like my hearts gonna stop from how fast its going. 

idk why but i can't sleep at all and end up pulling all nighters before most tests because i physically cannot lay in bed--i feel like i need to study more and more and more. i can't eat or drink much either cause i usually throw up before exams, but that might be bc of a sensitive stomach. i also start shaking the morning before school and i feel like i've tried everything idk how to make this stop im so sick of it

i study days to weeks in advance for even the smallest quizzes and i go into tests very positive, i try to have a good mindset about the situation, but i'm so sick of that crushing feeling during the exams when i blank out or dont remember anything. i do try really hard i feel like i constantly spend my time studying so hard for these tests and all i get back is a bad grade and all my effort gone to waste. 

im at the point of not wanting to even study anymore because i just know that i'll never do good on any tests, it doesn't matter how easy it is, i still fail. ill know everything before and after tests but during them, idk its as if i never even looked at the content. all of my friends do so well on every test and ill study so much more than they do, but ill do so much worse and im so sick of feeling inferior to everyone just bc i cant take some damn tests. i KNOW the information idk why i cant just show it. 

ah this is just me complaining now but i really need to find a way to fix this, its been happening for years and only recently i realised that test anxiety was a thing and i feel like its what i have, but again idk for sure. i just want my grades to reflect how hard im working, bc right now everyone thinks im lazing around and not working hard bc my gpa is bad purely bc of my test scores. 

i just need some advice on how to stop this feeling? idk what to call it lol"
717,I feel a panic attack coming on and I don’t know how to stop it,I’m shaking and really scared right now. I know half of it is my minds work but I don’t know what to do.
718,"Eating disorder, antidepressants, and weight gain","I (f19) have been dealing with depression for several years now, and within the last year it's gotten really bad. I've also been suffering from anorexic/restrictive tendencies (have not been diagnosed) and have lost a considerable amount of weight. I started going to therapy a couple of months ago, and I think it's helped, but I'm not sure. 

So, with all of this, I have decided that I want to talk to my doctor about starting antidepressants, but I am terrified of the weight gain. I want to get my eating back on track, but I feel that if I gain weight from the medication (which I wouldn't be able to control) rather than through conscious effort (which I would have control over) I would spiral. 

Has anyone dealt with this or have any advice?"

720,What do I do with my irrational fears severely effecting my life,"I just wanted to start out with me saying I'm 16 and never have been good with stressful situations. So months ago I lost my position in my first job and  my partner broke up with me as long with my parents divorcing a couple weeks ago. The stress from all of this and more have really made my anxiety and other issues go up. I now am having severe irrational fears such as a severe fear of others around me trying to hurt me or poison me even from those I trust. When I try to eat something I breakdown and have an anxiety attack. I know it's a stupid fear, I can feel myself getting weaker and I've lost almost 20 pounds but can't convince my mind that I'm safe. I don't know what to do. I play piano and other stuff and it helps with my stress and talking to the people around me but  Dealing with all the stress for so long I'll admit I've tried to end the stress in not the best way multiple times....  I don't know what to do at this point. What should I do. I've been told. to try and get mental help but I wouldn't know where to start. What should I do."
721,Help me help my grandma ?,"So my grandma on my dads side has mental health issues, she purposely does not take medications or does not believe in going to the doctors. But I’m having a hard time trying to figure out what exactly is her diagnosis since she’s never seen a doctor. And refuses to go. 

She basically lives in the past, my dad died about ten years ago but to this day she still asks about him. And we have to make up a story saying he’s fine and doing ok. One time my cousin tried to tell her that he died, she cried for a while then the next day went back to thinking he’s alive. 
Just random stuff like this, besides that she can function okay, knows how to roam around town on her own. But when it comes to certain things she’s not 100 percent there. 

I think it’s dementia? But I’m not sure. And I’m wondering if it’s hereditary too, because her daughter has a type of mental illness (not dementia). My dad was ok, no mental illness. 

Thank you"
722,I don't want to live anymore,"I'm 17, I have another 60-70 years left and I don't want to do that.  I don't plan on killing myself, but I wish there was a way it could just finish sooner.  A terminal disease would be blessing at this point, I don't give a fuck.  I don't think I've ever really been happy, and it's because of an unstable home life or any past trauma, I'm just sick of everything.  I feel like shit all the time and I can barely stand up half the time, how bad is it gonna get when I have arthritis and shit?  I'm lonely all the time and I can't make friends because I'm shit at any kind of communication.  Wish someone would just kill me or smth"
723,Depression and anxiety over going back to school,"I’m going back to college in less than two weeks and have severe depression/anxiety about it. I don’t really like my college that much or have close friends there really. However I like my program/ degree that’s specific to the school so I’ve stuck through it. 

it’s also out of state so I’m away from family and my boyfriend so I’m depressed to go back and scared how it will get when I get back there again. Not to mention covid is a thing and I have in person classes

This time it’s a bit worse than other times going back, cause my boyfriends moving. Not far, only like an extra 30 minutes away from me. But with him packing and moving in two days before I leave I’m anxious with time helping him move and time passing by fast along with the fact I have to repack. 

All of it is just emotionally overwhelming and find myself feeling more depressed, than anxious cause my anxiety has built up to the point of my giving up on feeling/doing much of anything."
724,Do I need to seek help?,"For about 3 or 4 I have felt numb, sad and had suicidal feelings and thoughts on and off.  Although I often do not feel like this for weeks or even a month or 2 at a time. I'm not sure if I acctually have an issue because I am capable of feeling fine and these feeling often go away. I convince myself that I'm just faking any problems or that I do have these problems often. I'm worried about seeking help due as I'm not sure if I need it. I am asking for advice. I'm asking this now because I've been feeling it bad recently with isolation     

(Apologies for poor description, I'm not good at describing emotion).

Note. My mum, sister and Grandmother suffer form recurrent depression. I'm not sure if theres any genetic link."
725,"Ever get told the ""attention seeking"" comment when you try talking about your problems?","I was trying to explain to my boyfriend why I might pick out weird power dynamic relationships in movies/books (think: man cares for a young girl, then ends up dating her when she turns 18 kind of vibes) because he said I do that a lot, which I do, when I picked out something I thought was weird and later in the conversation admitted that I was being too critical. I explained to him the reason I do it is because of a manipulative, exploitive relationship I had with someone older than me when I was younger. He said that it was irrelevant to bring up and I was attention seeking and trying to ""make a claim towards emotions"" because the reasoning was what it was. I think it's perfectly reasonable to respond with ""Well, this is why I do this thing you said I do a lot"". It just happened to be a darker, more personal reason. I kept trying to talk to him about how when he said that it hurt my feelings, and in the conversation even admitted that there are things I'm working on to change my judgment to less immediately clouded, because I did make a mistake with this particular relationship in judging it but he rarely is ever able to level with me and say ""You know what, I also made some mistakes in speaking to you"". He just continuously talks in a tone thats condescending and annoyed at having to have this conversation. It's like, well you admitted you were wrong about this one thing so can we just end it and not talk about what I also did wrong. And he said I don't talk to him very much about the more traumatic things in my life, and this is exactly why. Because I can tell how he feels about certain things- like he's asking ""why can't you just get over it?"" by saying it was irrelevant to bring up and that I'm attention seeking. This is why I've never talked about it, not with family, not with a therapist I had for two years, not with significant others. This is the sort of response I get. I have learned to take my issues seriously internally, learned how to work through a lot of stuff by myself in healthy ways. I've handled most of my trauma totally on my own, and it makes me really upset to think I'll never find someone I can talk to about it and who has compassion around those topics. I'm not asking for anyone to be my therapist, I'm just asking for someone to be open and not respond with things like ""you're being attention seeking"" just because they don't like that a reasoning was darker and not lighthearted."

727,What are the Top 5 ways to shift ones perspective during a depressive state?,We have all felt depressive symptoms at one point in our lives. I’m feeling quite depressed myself these days and in particular right now. I’m curious to know what kinds of tools people use to combat their own depression?
728,Mourning? Morbid thoughts.,"Recently I had a friend pass away and I cant stop thinking about death. The fact that I, my loved ones and everyone else will die one day. 
My mind is obsessed evaluating everyone's lifestyles and behaviors in order to figure out when and why they will die, and how everyone around them would react.

I've imagined my death multiple times in different scenarios, I am not suicidal, I dont dont want to die but I keep thinking about it. It feels as if death is slowly creeping and invading my life.

If you'd like more details feel free to look at my previous post here.

Is this a normal part of mourning?"

I just feel like I’m doing everything by myself. Cleaning by myself, taking care of my baby by myself, keeping everything in working condition by myself and I just can’t take it anymore"
730,Having weird thoughts about a person i am interested in.,"I am not entirely sure if this post is appropriate for this sub, but I could not think of any other subs where i could post this, so here goes. 

I have been talking to this girl more and more as of late, and we are planning on meeting up soon. But for some reason, I keep having these visions of us meeting up at a park or something and she stabs me to death or beats my head in with a mallet. I suffer from depression and anxiety, but have never had thoughts of paranoia, at least nothing major. 

Am I just overthinking this? At first I just ignored it but it seems to keep coming up in my head, so it’s beginning to worry me. Have any of you had similar thoughts? Please let me know!"
731,Why do I keep lying to myself,"
For a while I have been wondering where my pain came from. I thought I was going crazy. 
The voices in my head made me insane. I couldn’t explain the pain that I have been feeling. I didn’t understand myself or my feelings. I felt like a different person. Disconnected from my body. A foolish girl who didn’t knew what was happening. But now I know. I have been lying. Lying to myself, and the people around me. I didn’t want to face it. It was easier to pretend it never happened but it did. I got hurt. Someone hurt me. Someone who didn’t take no for an answer and forced me to go over my limits. I said no and he did it anyway. Did this really happen? It’s not the first time a man has sexually abused me. How did I get in this situation again? The reason I didn’t want to tell anyone about it is because it felt like it was my own fault. Was my skirt too short? Should I not have been wearing heels? Or was it because I was playing with my hair? Am I the reason he thought no meant yes? I never said my body was his to own but he took it anyway. My body has been on survival mode ever since. And still I protect him and tell everyone it wasn’t that bad while I know that he is the one who killed my soul..."
732,This is just a small positive I would like to share (:,"I’m at that point where the last two weeks have been a big, uh, depressive episode?? A slump?? Well I mean, I barely leave my room feel no actual emotions either good or bad and haven’t been taking care of my hygiene at all, I don’t really care enough and just as in a sort of self deprivation kinda mood. However, just set a timer for 20 minutes and at that point I’m gonna make myself have a shower, take care of myself, grab a water bottle, and a snack so that I’m good for school tomorrow, and I actually feel motivated to do it! I know it’s gross, but I’ve seen multiple people here talk about how hard it is to take care of their personal hygiene and wanted to share this small victory (:"
733,Do I sound like an evil person (a paedophile)?,"I had to check if they hurt them, by asking a person. Yeah, I did kind of feel bad for the p's, because I thought no one was hurt. I thought if no one was hurt, then it could not be wrong. If that was true, I would kill myself. I would NEVER do it. I felt bad for them, because people want to kill them, and I did not think it was OK to kill people who had no hurt anyone. I have not sexually abused anyone. It makes me feel physically sick. I could not be around people. I tried to get myself into prison, to protect people from me. All I could do was sleep. I have tried to kill myself several times, by swollowing paracetomol. The mental health team do not consider them real suicide attempts, because nothing happened, but I was trying to kill myself. It got to the stage where I thought you could no longer die from taking too many paracetomol. I have not sexually abused anyone, because I do not want to hurt somebody like that."
734,hypersensitivity and profound emotional experiences,"I've always been told that I was sensitive. Since I was maybe 15 I've noticed that I'm prone to having these incredibly profound emotional experiences. It can vary from borderline euphoria, a connection to everything in the universe, enhanced creativity, paranoia, disgust, loneliness, self loathing, blankness, existential dread, etc. These episodes last anywhere from a couple minutes to maybe a day. Sometimes they're triggered by something and other times it feels like it comes out of nowhere. I don't even bother reaching out to people about it most of the time because I know it's just kinda a passing thing that I have to deal with. I know everyone is prone to feeling these things but definitely not at the intensity that I do on a day to day basis. 

Does anyone else experience something like this? Is there a name for it? Is there anything I can do about it?"
735,Does this sound familiar? I need some advice,"So I know I have asperger's so that may affect this but still any advice would really help. Also I am 13 NB but AFAB

So I live in the USA and we so far handled covid horribly and that is really stressful just seeing with my own eyes how selfish people really can be. Not seeing any of my friends and online school it feels like so much I just kinda took a break without wanting to. Like I just couldn't do my schoolwork I can pretend to not be exhausted mentally after a few minutes of talking to people mh schoolwork is so so overdue but all day for hours I have been trying to motivate myself to do my schoolwork because school starts again tomorrow. I lost my motivation and I feel really shitty about it. I kinda wanna puke but I won't. I am so stressed out but I can't do it. At this point I am just watching youtube and killing eve my favorite show but everything else is getting less and less interesting. I'm not miserable the times I can actually talk to my friend she can make me laugh and we can have a good time. I haven't been much of a cryer for a few years but recently I have been crying a bit and I had a few tears (like 2-3 not a lot) come out writing this. My mom asked if I was depressed but I don't think I am. She was kinda casual about it. Part of me thinks going to therapy would be a good idea but I just think I would be wasting my moms money and everyones time over nothing. It is now 12 am. I have done absolutely nothing productive other than browse through amazon and pick out a few thing using a gift card but I did take a shower which I honestly don't do enough because it just takes more motivation than I have on a daily or even every other day. Motivation is my main issue. I want to function but I just can't. I have functioned more before. But this is all to much. Most of the time I feel neutral so I don't know if whatever is going on in my brain is a big deal. Also after discovering I was NB i gained a little confidence. So I am not doing to bad I don't think. 

Any advice If you read that sorry for the formatting 😅"
736,Fast and intense personality changes. Is this a symptom of a disorder?,"I have depression, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts as diagnosed by a psychiatrist. I have also had PTSD from watching a traumatic accident that didn’t get addressed, but for times sake I won’t explain why. For the past year, I have been dealing with a parent about to die, and this has only accelerated a trend in my life to an extreme point. I go through consuming personality and interest changes that end up embarrassing me and leaving me financially screwed. I buy tons of new clothes and throw the old ones away, despite hardly being worn, because they aren’t my style anymore. I change my music taste, what kind of food I eat, how I spend my weekends, etc. This may sound normal, but it’s always incredibly sudden and without reason, and leaves me to make dramatic decisions that I regret. For example, at the peak of my depression this last year, I fell into Wicca and other groups I once barely paid attention to. I started becoming obsessed with living small in an environmentally clean place with a garden. I dreamed of going to college in a state that I had once never cared about or even tried to think about. I tried learning a new instrument and spent tons of money on this new hobby. Like a switch flipped, though, I didn’t want this anymore. I went right into wanting a life of libraries, a successful career, city-life, etc. If it was just interest changes, that would be one thing, but I’m starting to get dissociated from myself. I am always “myself” so I know I don’t have multiple personality disorder, but this jarring change has made the last years of my life feel fake. When I see pictures of myself from March, I don’t recognize myself because I had envisioned myself as being different. A part of me is worried, now that I have a boyfriend who I love and who loves me, that I’m going to have a dramatic personality change and it will cause problems with us. 

Also, my attitude is different with these personalities. When I got really depressed, I yelled at a few friends for things I bottled up for a long time. I didn’t apologize or feel a need to. When I started “switching” I immediately apologized and acted softer, Now, though, I think back and don’t remember ever truly feeling sorry about the situation, but I also don’t remember truly feeling angry enough to yell at them. It’s like my actions are driven by this persona I’m trying to put out. It’s like the typical teen who doesn’t know herself trope, but it’s harmful to herself and others, and it’s more of an act. 

That’s the key feeling, I feel like an actress who is dressing the part, saying the lines, and displaying the correct emotion. However, the role always ends and I move on to a new part. (An example would be cottage-core. I loved it, bought stuff for it, changed my attitude to be more soft and “sunshiny” then like a switch I moved on to a more grunge style where I kind of became a bitch). None of them feel like me though. 

I don’t know what else to add to properly explain how it feels, but all of the stupid stuff I’ve bought and the decisions I’ve made (like what colleges to apply to) have left me feeling incredibly stressed. 

TL/DR: I feel stressed and anxious because my past personality changes were incredibly sudden and all-consuming. I made important decisions based on these temporary times."
737,My mind keeps telling me to kill myself.,"Almost every day. I just repeat it so many times in my head. I'm terrified to tell my family how I feel. It's been years I've kept my feelings hidden, and they think I'm fine as far as I'm aware. They haven't seen my arms or legs in months and they still don't question me. It feels like it would be easier if they caught me, but they never do. I wouldn't have to start the confrontation. I just can't bring myself to tell them. I don't know why. I don't want to die. But I'm getting really tired of this. I feel like I'm sinking deeper and deeper and I don't know where or who I am anymore. I'm falling apart. Literally feel like I'm fucking falling apart."
738,I’m feeling alone,Does anyone care about me? I’m feeling like I don’t exist to anyone
739,Coronavirus and the Trump getting elected we're both my fault.,"It's like I'm the antichrist or something. Both of those things are terrible and they were caused by me. Idk why. I make people feel like shit and I have no control over that. Welp, time to do cardio."
740,Does anyone else struggle with conversations?,"I’ve noticed since my depression started a few years ago that I struggle with conversations. It seems to happen when my depression is at its worst. This is usually with friends of friends (back before COVID) with whom I’m making small talk and getting to know better, but sometimes it also happens with close friends and family.

I get anxious about saying the right thing at the right time in the conversation to the right person. I get concerned and wonder if the “moment” has passed and it’s time to move on from what I had planned to say. I feel like a person in a play with the part of Someone Making Conversation, with only a vague, dream-like recollection of my lines.

Does this happen to anyone else? What helps you with it?"
741,My girlfriend is depressed and I need help with advice,"My girlfriend has been going through a difficult time for the past week and it seems like whatever i do doesn’t help and she actively says so. It started with her mom constantly getting on to her over nothingAnd her work being stressful and her not being able to see me. She’s had previous issues with her mental health and it’s only gotten worse no matter how hard i try to comfort her and/ or do things with her to try and cheer her up. She’s... had a very abusive past ex and it still affects her till this day even after seeing a therapist. I care for her and love her and i want to help but I don’t know what to do, so i’ll gladly accept any advice. I’ve even talked to her about going to the therapist again for help because she claims he helped her.. but she’s reluctant."
742,I'm gonna rape if I cant find somebody,"Honestly this is just me being delirious and jm probably gonna delete this account soon anyways but I just need to get this out of my thoughts. It's like one of those evil thoughts you have in the back of your head that's just like the elephant in the room that makes you go crazy. Honestly I'm pretty young and wouldn't consider myself the incel type but fuckkkkk. I just cant help but fall for toxic girls who end up abandoning me and leaving me hurt. I literally have no friends to talk to and my family really could give a shit less about me so I'm just not gonna care about some kind of external made up societal reputation bullshit anyways. This could just be me rambling but honestly the only constraints we have as people from being evil are our families and time. I feel like fucking shit that's why jm saying all this but I really have thought about it. I mean who's not to say that I don't just go out right now and brutally murder or rape somebody? Shit seems fucking easy and if I'm lucky I'll end up like ted bundy and earn a reputation that way. Nobody likes me lol I can see why I'm a sick fuck I guess but they're really the ones who made me this way. Why would you hurt somebody you care so much about? Why would you abandon somebody out of nowhere after building everything up? Why do I have to waste so much fucking time and energy for unrequited love when all I want is some attention and fucking love to for fucks sake, abandoning someone is like rape in itself."
743,Is this psychosis? Or just severe depression? TW: Self injury,"For the past few months I have had recurring intrusive thoughts centered around severe self mutilation, either in the form of castration or amputation. I do not want to do either of those things, it terrifies me, but the urge to do it is very strong and I've begun self harming again as a way to try and relieve these urges.

I've been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 so I'm not sure if these intrusive thoughts are related or not. The intensity of them is so strong and I'm worried I'm going to actually follow through with them. Has anyone else experienced something like this? I don't know what is going on. I see my psychiatrist next week :/"
744,Does this happen to anyone else?,"HELP! I’m currently 20 weeks pregnant and I’m pretty sure my pregnancy is worsen my anxiety and OCD. Lately I’ve been going through itching fits at night until I’m barely able to fall asleep, also the feeling of being dirty or everything is dirty has gotten increasingly worse. I was prescribed lexapro but I’m not sure if I should take it or not! I’ve been feeling miserable and don’t know what to do! 😭"
745,I don’t want to distract myself but I can’t handle negativity. How to stop?,"Hey everyone, 
 
Recently I have noticed that the flow of information is overwhelming me. For instance, I watch educational YouTube videos, read books, read news, listen to podcasts. I haven’t much enhanced my overall awareness and knowledge but rather got lost. I feel like I don’t know myself and I even lost an ability to be by myself, alone, one on one with my thoughts. I even fall asleep with Netflix on the background so that I don’t get trapped in my anxiety. 

So, I decided to limit the amount of information flowing into my brain and instead decided to spend more time thinking and spending time with myself. Usually, I go swimming, walking with headphones, but now I decided I will just listen to nature and talk to myself.

BUT, I constantly catch myself negative self talking, playing negative scenarios, arguing with someone in my head and etc. It bugs me I even cried about if this is what it feels like. I want to have different thoughts, I want to have positive scenarios in my mind, I want to refine my goals and aspirations in my mind and get motivated, but instead I catch myself beating someone up in my head. 

I have turned to few self-help videos on YouTube in which psychologists do not suggest to force certain thoughts or positive mindset onto yourself and instead let your thoughts flow independently. 

So then how do I make these negative thoughts stop popping up in my mind? I almost feel physically and mentally exhausted consciously forcing my mind NOT to have negative thoughts, but the second I relax it comes back. How do I stop this? Is it then better to distract yourself with useless info? I mean, I am terrified to be even more lost in few months if I distract myself but at the same time I can’t handle so much unnecessary useless unknown negativity, rage and anger inside myself."
746,Overly thinking,Does anyone over think at night like your thoughts over come you and only worry about the worst outcome to the point you feel hopeless and anxiety takes over to the point of crying or almost crying and you just don’t know what to do anymore. Your also scared to talk to someone about these feelings. Any advice on how to get better cause I can live like this anymore. Got to a point I was saying to my self that my anxiety took over me and crying in bed and I wanted it to all end by killing my self. After that I know something is wrong cause I never was like this so I would like so advice please.
747,I don't know who I am. OCD killed my soul.,"I feel so empty inside and I don't know who I am outside of ocd. I struggled with OCD ever since I was 9 years old. Now I'm 28 and I am just so lost and so tired. I'm borderline emotionless most of the time. I'm constantly lost inside of my head thinking. Thinking terrible things.

I fear my morality has been corrupted and corroded away and I cant even find it in myself to fight back or even care. I have toxic masculinity and alt right shit supremacist bullshit ocd thoughts and they won't leave. Things like transphobia ( even though I believe I may be a closeted transwoman) sexist thoughts about women and how they are inferior to men( which would include me if I'm a closeted transwoman), how any race other than white people are inferior to whites, social darwinism etc. Ironically I also deal with ocd thoughts telling me morality is relative and none of the above matter either.

Everytime I get on the internet and see some comment from some alt right troll saying vile shit my mind just automatically believes them. I can't disagree with it and feel as if it is the absolute truth. I know logically it is wrong and immoral but I can't argue against it and it feels like the absolute truth and that I should just accept it and act accordingly.

I wish I wasnt such a goddamn vile sack of shit. I wish I actually had morals and didn't believe horrid shit like this. I wish I was a normal good person like everyone else. That being a good person comes naturally to me. But it doesn't. I'm corrupted. I am beyond redemption. My brain tells me to give in and being a hateful sexist white supremacist and accept that I am supposed to be an tough masculine man or else I'm a pathetic weakling.

I fear that even if I was to get rid of the ocd I would either realize that on the inside I'm a vile human being that deserves death or my personality would be so empty and void because I'm nothing without my thoughts. If brainwashing was real I would mk ultra my ass into a better person.

I don't even know how to do erp. My therapist is useless and she doesn't know what is wrong with me and I'm just too damn apathetic to look for a good one. I'm just too broken. I can't even bring my self to commit suicide because I am so apathetic. I don't know what to do."
748,"I have trouble being happy with my appearance, and I’m constantly stressed about my weight. How can I learn to be happy the way I am?","So, I’m 6’0 and 205 pounds. I’m also 19. I constantly stress about my weight. When I was 17, I went from 220 to around 160 in the span of 2 months. Recently, I got up to around 220 again, but the weight isn’t going as fast as I would like. I’m doing my best not to just stop eating all together. I don’t really remember if I did or not last time. Whenever I mention my weight to any of my friends and family, they look at me like I’m crazy, telling me that I’m skinny or don’t need to lose weight, but even when I was 160 I still felt larger than I wanted to be. I attempted to use my college’s counseling service, but after my first visit they never got back to me. What are some good resources/ good pieces of advice for my situation?"
749,Got off of my antidepressant and on a mood stabilizer,I feel very anxious and depressed. It was probably a bad idea.
750,I'm finally in a good place mentally 😊,"📍As I learn more and more about mental health and mental health awareness, I've started my YouTube channel. 
📍My first video is called ""MENTAL HEALTH-For teenagers by teenagers"".I've Discussed various topics like anxiety and depression
📍https://youtu.be/_N3YVLRXMCc
     I would love some constructive criticism by you 😊 ❤"
751,I would love someone to talk to. I am a very dark place.,I have an ex who keeps walking into my life for a fast min and telling me she loves me then runs off every time. It’s really starting to wear on me. I find it crazy how someone can do this to another person. I haven’t slept in months. I would love to find someone to talk to. Peace and love to you all.
752,I’m always tired but I can never sleep,"Other people who have problems sleeping can you give me some advice please. I haven’t been registered with a psychiatrist for 4 months now.

I’ve tried basically every medication to help me sleep except benzos as my psychiatrist didn’t want to prescribe them, but I’ve tried trazodone, risperidone, promethazine, melatonin, mirtazapine, quetiapine, and probably a few more that I’m forgetting. All of them either didn’t work or gave me mild to horrible side effects (promethazine, trazodone, mirtazapine and quetiapine). Here you can get diphenhydramine over the counter but I’m worried that they’d give me the same restless leg/parkinsonism symptoms that promethazine gives me since they’re both the same type of antihistamine. 

I tried meditation and going for walks but still I woke up at 2 am today, 4 am yesterday, and the days before that went 36 hours without sleeping. My diet is ok too, I don’t get takeaways or anything and I don’t eat meat, and I make all my own food. Also it only took me 3 hours since waking up this morning to decide I felt tired enough to go to sleep again but obviously I couldn’t. This is really preventing me from going to school/getting a job as sometimes I’m awake until 9 or 10 in the morning and sometimes I’m awake straight through to the next night."
753,I’m worried that I’m going to become a bad person because my comfort character did horrible things,"I don’t know why I’m Suddnly freaking out about this. To put it simply I have a comfort character who I’m not going to name cause I don’t want to spoil the sorce material. And basically In the game this person frames Somone for sexual assault, Convinces another person who cared about her to kill the person she framed ans then killed the person she convinced. Because of this event in the game I’m heavily judged for having her as a comfort character. But her personality and her mentality really helps me get through the shit in my life and she’s a really important character for me, Am I going to end up doing something as bad as she did?"
754,Had 5 panic attacks consecutively,"Hey guys, just just 2 hours ago i was sleeping and i woke up for water. And i tried going back to sleep my mind went into dark thoughts circle and the harder i tried to stop these thoughts the worse they got and my heart started beating so fast everytime I switched positions in effort of trying to go back to sleep. After 5 intense heart palpitations and shortness of breath. My heart rate dropped to the point where i can’t feel my pulse right now. Is this normal ? Please help me guys, i think i am going insane"
755,Can taking away games as a punishment cause negative consequences in the opposite way intended (knowing that they are proven to be a great stress reliever and a way to take a mental break),"I'm  not saying games and other rewarding things shouldn't be taken away if  the person is doing bad in school or other forms of punishment for doing  bad things, but video games have been shown to be a great way to get  away from the sometimes harsh reality for some people, such as school or  life in general for kids. If a parent were to take away this way of  taking a mental break and possibly being the person's biggest way to  relieve some stress, for a considerably large period of time such as for  more than a couple of months, could this cause some one such as a child  in this scenario to become more stressed and become less respectful of  their parents for doing so? Personally I believe so, I know someone who  has anger and stress issues (specifically has ADHD) which their main way  in the past of relieving stress was playing video games to what they  said ""take a break from school and overall life issues."" It kind of  worries me because they have been recently telling me that since their  games have been taken away (around 8 months ago) they have been more  stressed and angered over things and have less ways to take away from  stress-building subjects such as school, work and other things, and they  also tell me that it also has been affecting their sleep, as they have  always had a hard time falling asleep without having something to keep  their mind off of harsh things or something positive to think about in  general and will often stay up much longer than they did when they did  play games (keep in mind, they usually only played for a couple of hours  a day, if even) and I have noticed them being emotionally off and more  tired than they have been previously before they had their games taken  away. They also tell me that when their parents punish them for other  things now, it doesn't have much of an effect on him and makes him feel  less obligated to fix the thing they are punished for, so this might  also possibly be affecting his respect for their parents as well for  taking away such a big thing away from them?  Should I be worried about  them, or am I looking too into this? I have ADHD myself and sometimes I  really do just need a break from reality, escapism, such as watching a  show or playing games. I'll be ignoring comments who call gaming an  addiction, everyone has their hobbies and interests, this is simply  asking whether taking away something that can relieve stress and solve  other problems can be negative and if there are any recommendations I can give to him and possibly his guardians (some articles and research  that support this would help too, specifically the negative effects of  taking away stress relievers)."
756,i really don’t want to be here,"i hate myself and everybody hates me, nobodys my friend unless i say i don’t have friends. my girlfriend isn’t fucking phased by our breakup because she’s wanted by so many other boys, but nobody wants me. i’m struggling to find motivation to shower and i’m not improving at basketball. i wake up in the night from dreams that i have about her. i lost her and i hate myself for it."

📍So far I'm at 43 subs, but I wanna reach 50. Please drop a sub and help me out."
758,I don't know what to do.,"I have a lot that's been going on recently, and nobody knows. I'm going to put it in a very general way, but I'm 15, living with my parents, and putting my mental state aside right now, my physical health is also concerning me, quite a lot on fact. I feel like my health is deteriorating, but I'm not sure what to say to anybody, as my parents will say I'm fine. I have athsma, tourette's, really every symptom of ocd (which usually comes with tourette's, and ocd would explain another self diagnosed dermatophagia). I have been an exceptional reader and writer my whole life, but now struggle to read sentences out loud, I can't speak without stuttering, blending words together, and more often than not will have to stop and think about what I was saying in order to continue. I've had serious problems with my memory, and it sounds like it's so simple, like I forgot what I had for breakfast, but it's everything. Best way I can explain it is almost everythinf important, from my breakfast to instructions for something, picture a house off in the distance. There a fog, so you can see the house, see the outline, the shape, but can't quite make out the rest. That is every detail of my days. I have these bad headaches that put me out of comission for hours, seeing doctors to no avail. I'm starting to have trouble standing, because when I do I feel light headed, a few times have almost fallen. I  That is just the outline of the physical part.

As for mental, I spoke to a counselor all of three times. Don't wanna go back, because she wants to talk to my parents. She thinks I have depression, I think she's right now. I find no joy in any single thing I do ever, all of the health related stuff is getting to me. I feel like nobody likes me, I'm worthless, and that people would be happier if I was gone, and I know those aren't good thoughts to have, but I can't help it. I just feel so alone, yet I'm surrounded by people. Like the title says, I don't even know what to do anymore."
759,I just need to scream into the void to others who might understand,"The last year has been hell for everyone but lucky for me I had a few extra disasters blow up and add to the basic 2020 chaos. I’ve been working hard and trying to get to a better place. Lots of ups and downs still. But now it’s January and it has become significantly harder to deal with this month since the suicide of a good friend the 22nd of this month 2 years ago. (RIP Jake💜) And NYE is extra painful since that was totally our holiday and we went hardcore for it and the next couple days too lol. But again, I’m working on shit and always reaching out to friends when I need it and it’s been ok. 

Then fucking tonight happens— I’m shooting the shit with a guy I know and he’s familiar with some of the stuff that’s happened the last couple of years and has always been pretty cool, supportive and listens. I’ve done the same for him too when he’s going through shit. 
He decides to just go 120% complete mega asshole: “Don’t dwell.” “Reorient yourself.” “I hit bottom and figured it out. Fuck your pity party.” “That shit is on you and you alone.” And several other wonderful examples of the most cringey, unhelpful shit you can possibly say to someone who battles mental illnesses. Absolute max level douchebaggery. 

For perspective here’s a quick rundown on him:
He’s almost 40, has raging alcohol and coke addictions on top of 4 DUIs and his rock bottom happened a few years ago after getting fired. That occurred after a drunken/coke fueled, angry breakdown where he broke his hand to pieces punching everything while on the clock at work. 
So then mommy and daddy swoop in to help him out of that situation and take him to his surgeries and shit to rebuild his hand. And he was already living at home with them after getting his last DUI and is still living there now over 2 years later. And somehow he still had the AUDACITY to text me about how he did it all on his own and didn’t need help and the rest of the bullshit quotes up above. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤯

Bonus asshole points: I sarcastically congratulated him on his “PhD” since he was insistent he knows more than my doctors and other team of mental health professionals I see regularly. So he responds saying it would be easy enough to fake his way through if he cared enough to do so. Ummmmm 🤯🤯🤯🤯 Yeah fuckhead, clearly earning a PhD would be a breeze for the dude who has worked in restaurants most of his life to fund his $1,000++ a month coke addiction while pounding vodka straight from the bottle- I’m sure med school would be a piece of cake with those life skills. 

So if you made it through that whole train wreck of a vent session, thank you."
760,I just felt so angry at everything and everyone who has wronged me. How do I cope with this?,"Title is pretty self explanatory. I have been in a bad slump due to a big move coming up (move across the planet) combined with a injury in which I'm currently teaching myself how to walk again. This has sorta manifested a lot of emotions including a lot of anger to where I'm now feeling angry for things that happened in my past as well as things currently happening. 

I'm sorta at the point where I feel like everyone and everything that has wronged, ignored me, wasn't there for me, needs to know that and needs to pay for what they have done and the emotional trauma they have caused me at some point. 

By they I mean people as significant as my parents who didn't do the best job raising me, to friends who have abandoned me when I needed them, to ex's who cheated, to the random person on my Facebook who always post negative stuff which ruins my mood. Like I feel like literally telling off and beating the crap out of all of them as well as any new people who cross me wrong. 

Knowing me who hates confrontation, I wouldn't do this but the feeling is still there and getting worse. I am currently in a leg brace and it's literally gotten to the point where I feel like I will flat out curse out the next person who stares at me funny. 

How do I cope with this sort of increasing anger?"
761,Job Search,"Feeling slightly or rather badly burnt out for this job search, had applied for jobs since a few months ago and didnt hear any confirmation of any job offer after the different job interviews. 

Currently getting a bit restless and reluctant and also scarred to apply  for jobs, since its going to be another rejection after another and im getting really tired of this whole job search process.

Looking at this current job postings and seeing the large number of applicants, with some applications that has 100-200 applicants probably just dampen my spirits even further"
762,"Hello, what to say when people are having a bad time.","Hey, recently and for the last few years since i am in high school i met a lot of people with mental health problems. I myself had a hard time too and most of the people i know it was hard to grow up. I always knew when i was talking to other people what to say and be positive and tell them that everything will be alright. But what i found out this year that if you have problems and you spill it out to someone you will mostly never get the answer you wanted to hear. It is a thing you need to solve yourself (that doesnt mean you shouldnt tell anyone, because telling things that bother you always helps atleast a little bit). But im wondering, what to tell people when they are having a bad time. I mean with bad time as depression or just feeling really bad about yourself and self harming your body. I mean people like to say that you should do the things that makes you happy and bla bla, because in my personal expirience when i have a bad time, there isnt much things that makes happy or mostly nothing makes me happy at that point. I just realized that these waves of bad energy come and go and that i should always know that they will go away. But is it really helpful if you just tell someone that this will end at some point and it is gonna come back but it is gonna go away again? I mean it is nice to say that you are there for them and you can talk to them at anytime, but sometimes i feel like that is not enough. Most of the people would suggest psychiatrist which i totally support, but these people sometimes dont feel like they deserve such help, some of them dont have the money since most of our parents of this generation are old school and they actually dont believe in mental health problems, so they are stuck in this alone. **So i am just asking, when iam with people that have breakdown or panic attacks, how to help them most effectively?** There are things like just being with them and calming them down and say that this will end and everything will be okay, but most of the time they are going through that alone and iam not there. I dont want them to do anything that will harm themselves :(. I get them, because i went through the same things but fuck me i still dont know the actual method that would help me, i was lucky that i was strong enough to survive my last years of hell when growing up and now i found peace for me, but i wanna help others. The only thing i learned is to just wait to pass it, but when you are in a bad wave it sometimes feels like eternity and people will do stupid things so it will end. Thank you for reading this and if you have any expiriences in this i would appriciate if you would comment."
763,Does anyone else stop emotionally opening up to someone once you’ve been friends with them for a long time?,"I realized that once I’ve been friends with someone up to a certain point, I stop sharing that many personal things with them. Today I hung out with someone who I’ve been friends with for 11 years now, and in the middle of a deep conversation, she realized that there’s a lot about me she didn’t know and and she started asking probing questions and I got really uncomfortable and started sugarcoating my answers cause I didn’t want her to know much. I used to literally tell her everything but I don’t feel comfortable doing that anymore. 

It’s really weird cause you would think that after 11 years I would feel comfortable telling her everything but I felt like some things were too heavy and I had to “protect” her from knowing those things about me. This is a pattern I noticed in all my friendships. I don’t understand why I do this, but around the 5 yr mark, I just stop letting friends know almost anything negative about my life. I don’t even want to cry in front of them anymore. I wanna be there for them but I can’t let them know TOO much about me."
764,Mindful Monday!,"Good morning friends!  


What are 2 things you plan to do this week to practice mindfulness?   


Mindfulness means to become the empowered viewer, rather than the helpless participant, in your life. To observe, without judgment, your thoughts and feelings. To be able to take a step back and enjoy an experience, without feeling the need to move to the next experience."
765,I’m 25 and currently in the beginning stages of a cancer scare.,"I’ve just been told that my doctor wants to do a  “two week urgent referral” for an MRI of my brain. They’re a bit concerned about the possibility of a tumour (her words were “usually there’s nothing on the scan but we just want to be sure”)

There’s only a TINY chance that they’ll find something on the scan. More unlikely than likely actually. But in a stupid way I feel like I’m being a burden. When they find nothing on the scan I’ll feel like I’ve wasted valuable time. In the middle of a pandemic I didn’t want to add to the stress of the world. But on the off chance they do find something, I’ve done nothing but create hassle for my family. 10 years of suicide attempts, psychiatric admissions, bad news after bad news... I’m finally out for the longest time since schizophrenia took over (1 year hospital free), and now I’m putting them through this? When does it end??? 

I feel like I’m not supposed to be here and my family are having to suffer for it."
766,"Probably just a vent, it’s a lot though, sorry","This is probably just me venting so ya know, bare with me.

Lately I haven’t been the greatest, I’ve noticed that I ruin everything I touch. Me and my mothers relationship is basically in shambles just because I couldn’t let go and move on from past traumas and because I couldn’t forgive her for playing a significant role in them. I feel incredibly guilty about it, I love her a lot and I’ve always lived my life based on what she wanted and willingly chose to exclude what I wanted. I basically idolized her and put her on a pedestal, I’m not entirely sure why but it might have been because I desperately needed her approval because approval=love in our family. Recently though, I haven’t really been doing that and it almost feels like I’m angry or upset with her but inside me I still need that approval. 

Most of the time I’ve never really felt anything, the only emotion I remember feeling as a kid was anger at everything and everyone. I would go years without crying unless I had a valid reason. These days I can’t stop myself from crying while I’m driving home and most of the time I just do it without a reason. I seen this thing online about how people will sometimes confuse feeling normal with feeling nothing, that may be what’s actually going on but I can’t tell for sure. 

Today I worked a short shift, the rest of my family went out to get dinner while I was at work. When I got home the doors were still locked and no one was answering their phones. In my mind I knew why, I knew that this made sense but I just started having a mental break down over this small thing, I just had to wait 10 mins and they would be back but I just got so upset. So I got in my car and I drove around for a while, at first I drove around the area, to calm myself down. I felt like I couldn’t go home though so I asked a friend if she wanted to hang out but she said she was busy. That was understandable but for some fucked up reason I just got worse, I felt like I was being clingy and that no one wanted me around. So I just kept driving but this time I just drove. I just kept driving straight, pretty soon I couldn’t recognize where I was and I noticed that I had been gone for hours so I headed back home. When I got there my mom was at the door but I was still upset from before so I was a little rude, I didn’t yell at her or anything, I just answered her questions with single words, walked past her and didn’t make eye contact. After I ate, my body was so exhausted that I went to sleep. I feel really horrible about how I acted but I feel like I can’t apologize or explain to her why I was like that. I’m afraid that our relationship will never get better and that it will either stay the same or get worse.

I’ve been talking about moving out for the past few days and she is mad at me for it, she thinks that I don’t want to be here because of her, which isn’t entirely a lie but the main reason is because I need to get out of here and be in my own or I’ll end up getting worse. This makes me feel even more guilty. 

I know that I’m not entirely stable, I’ve been questioning what’s wrong with me for years, I’ve gone from depression to anxiety, bipolar, ocd, and bpd. I’m not trying to self diagnose though. So I’m sorry that this is a lot and to those of you who stuck around thank you, I’m pretty sure this is just a vent but if anyone has any input or even just some kind of explanation as to why I feel this way and why I did the things I did that would be really awesome."
767,"Its currently 3AM I'm feeling like shot and kinda want to talk, but too afraid to speak to people around me.","I'm 16 and currently suffering from/and diagnosed with depression, psychosis, schizophrenia, and psychotic disorder. I often become lucid and drift off into separate worlds where I can either be immersed in darkness and see nothing, or be shoved into a series of gruesome and grotesque events that's leave scars in mind and shatter my resolve repeatedly. I've been like this since I was 6 or 7. I've attempted suicide multiple times, and even attended to jump off a bridge infront of my mom and older brother, when I was 12. My family has never been the supporting type, and honestly growing up, my relationship with them has always been, borderline abusive? Dont get me wrong I love them and they mean well, they just realize the situation. And ever since I first witnessed how messed up my own mind was, I just seized to feel anything meaningful in my life. At age 11, I just gave up. I didn't want to continue, I didnt want to exist. In a way, I had a midlife crisis before I hit my teenage years. I've tried to get help before, I tried to get a therapist, but it never worked. I found myself lying to them and just wanted to get the pills and leave. But even then, after being medicated, I never felt right, no matter how many times I took them; until I eventually stopped. As I mature, and even now, I find myself socially awkward, antisocial, erratic, compulsive, and a mess. I lay awake at night and hallucinate and listen to the voices in my head scream away. The thoughts that run through my head grow darker by the minute and eventually consume me, the follow me into my dreams and rob me of my sleep and drain my soul from my body.                             TL;DR: I'm fucked straight down to hell"
768,Does my 17 year-old daughter sound like she has mental-health issues?,"1)Started crying when her step-auntie called her beautiful. She was unsure why she was crying. Her step-Mum was not happy with her, and tried to say that my daughter thought she was being horrible to her, but she never.
2)Cries excessively when she gets negative feeback at school. 
3)Cried for two days straight, when her best friend left high-school, because she thought she would never see her again. Her friend was just off to college, because she was in the year above.
4)Cries, when someone says something nasty to her.
5)Cries, when she is on her own.
6)Has an anger problem, and has hit people before.
7)She is a huge day-dreamer.
8)She is a fidget, and had to be put to sleep for an .M.R.I. scan before.
9)In arguments with me, she will start crying, and she will start saying things like: 'I hate myself!, I hate you!, Why does nobody love me?, I need help!, There is something wrong with me!, I just want to be normal!, I am a bad person!, I am crazy!, and I want to die!'.
10)Sometimes when she is in public she will pinch herself, so she does not cry.
11)She hates sleep. It takes herself hours to get to sleep, and will avoid it, because she will say it is boring.
12)She was being bullied at school, and one of the girls uploaded a picture of her on Facebook, sitting on her own, and a girl was behind her pulling a funny face. When she saw it, she fell on the floor crying, and hitting her leg, and arms on the floor, like a toddler would in a tantrum. She did it another time when her step-Mum said she would do her hair for an event, then changed her mind. She felt like everyone would be looking, and making comments about her, so threw a tantrum.
13)She has a fear of rejection. 
14)She thought about cutting herself all over her body, because she thought if her bullies knew how much pain she was in they would leave her alone.
15)She skips school, if someone gives her a mean comment, or she has not completed her homework."

771,Reality vs Imagination,"Hi! Female, 24 yrs old. This happened from 17-24 yrs old me. I always imagine stories and stuff since I like writing story but the thing is I sometimes find myself getting confused which is reality and imagination. Like there's this one time I was talking with my friend and I was about to to tell her a certain incident that has never happend in real life, but a story in my brain. At first few times I ignored it.. but what got me terrified was when I was about to act like I was the character in my head.. But then I realized that was not me. These usually happened for a few seconds before I get back to reality. These don't happen all the time unless I am spending hours of imagining a story for days. 

I have never been to any therapy but I have experienced depression since when I was 12. Went through a lot of mental breakdown. Sometimes I'm paranoid in the middle of the night with insomia. Short episode of anger issue last year due to stress from pandemic. Experienced sleep walking once.

It'll be great if you can give me an idea what's this?

TL;DR : I am sometime confused  between my reality and imagination."
772,I have depression and maybe something else?,"I’ve just been contemplating the changes I’ve experienced over the years (I’m a 27 year old queer man) and some childhood experiences that I feel like not a whole lot of people can relate to, which makes me feel weird and isolated... so, this is sort of just thoughts on a page, and not really a specific question I guess. It would be nice to hear from others with similar experiences though.

In high school, I acted like a total extrovert. I was very involved in lots of activities, I interacted with tons of people and didn’t blink an eye about large social gatherings or giving speeches or anything... as the end of college came around and in the five years since, I feel like I’ve gotten much more reserved and introverted, which is fine, but I also feel very cold and distant and unpersonable... it’s a lot different than the image of myself I had just seven or eight years ago.

It’s just made me really question a lot of things, particularly my career choice. I’m a teacher and I just think I don’t do a good job of connecting with kids or the other adults in my building. I want to spend time by myself doing my own thing lol. It makes me regret putting all my eggs into the education basket because I feel like I have no career prospects that aren’t entirely people-centric... I’ve thought about doing a coding program to transition careers but it would be a financial nightmare at this point...

Related to feeling cold and distant, I also have come to realize that I don’t really miss people... this year has been crazy for lots of reasons, but I’ve stopped having a relationship with my parents or any of my extended family, and one of my best friends... all that stuff sucked at the time when it happened, but I don’t miss them. And I don’t really miss my remaining friends or family the way it feels like I should... I tried researching if not missing people is a symptom of any mental illnesses and I couldn’t really come up with anything.

I come from a very emotionally distant and not physically affectionate family. My parents never developed the habit of saying “I love you” or giving hugs when we were growing up. Again, in high school, I feel like I was pretty socially competent. I would give hugs and chit chat and hang out and everything. But now I straight up don’t do hugs with anyone but my partner... not even with my siblings or best friend who I hugged all the time in high school.

So at this point I have a few good friends left and I know now as an older adult that this is much more manageable and realistic than the “friends” we all had in high school and college, who we really just called our friends because we saw each other every day. But does it sound like I have some attachment problem? Like if my last few friends and I lost touch, I don’t think I’d be too bothered? But who would be fulfilling my emotional needs? Do I have those anymore? I can’t really tell.

The last experience I wanted to share is from my childhood, and it seems like a lot of people with experiences like this have them as adults, not kids. But we (my brother, me, and my sister) grew up with a mentally ill, hoarding mother. Our house was an absolute wreck all of the time: not just newspapers or books or clothes, but straight up reality TV hoarding shows, with trash and rotting food and animal feces and urine everywhere. We stank and we were relentlessly bullied in school for it. No one could ever come over to our house, and we all had to be so secretive about it because it was so embarrassing. 

My sister and I were very social and spent a lot of time out of the house, especially once we were in high school. We washed our own clothes and kept our rooms fairly clean so we had an okay time in high school, but my older brother definitely had the worst of it throughout, plus he wasn’t (isn’t) very social. 

I know living in a house like that caused all sorts of trauma for me and my siblings that we are still trying to unpack... but it seems like most people with hoarding parents were grown and moved out before the hoarding started. Is there anyone out there who grew up in a house like mine that would like to connect? I fear that the stuff that has happened with my parents this year, plus the way I grew up, is going to leave me permanently emotionally scarred and stunted, and I need some perspective to figure out what to do about it...

Thanks for reading y’all. 😊"

774,What’s wrong with my roomie? She screams in sleep every night..,"So I have been living with this new roomie for just over a month..she screams in her sleep every night. Usually around 1am-4am.. our rooms are far from each other but I got waken up by her scream every night... almost had heart attack.. 

It is very very loud.. like it sounds like she is in pain or someone is torturing her. Like right now, it’s 1:53am, she yelled ‘don’t kill me’ in a really miserable and scared tone that woke me up and my heart is racing now obviously by the sudden noise.. yesterday she was yelling something like ‘you’re sick’ in her dream. 

She told me she has this issue since she was very little. She also falls asleep anytime like when she is eating, talking and even driving.... 

She is a really weird person in general. Extremely emotional and immature (we’re both at our late 20s). 

She believes she is haunted by ghosts... I think she might have some mental issue? Judging by she is very unstable even when she is awake during the daytime and she would just cry and lose her shit when things don’t go as she want.

Any thoughts will be highly appreciated."
775,Should I purposefully make things worse so that I am more motivated to get help?,"When I feel bad about myself or problems and my life I feel like professional help would be a good thing. However, when I feel fine I am extremely unmotivated to get help because my problems don't feel bad enough to justify getting help. In both scenarios my thoughts feel correct.

Logically I know that professional help may be beneficial in my situation (avoidance, anger at myself, low self esteem, self harm, bad discipline, others). Maybe If I put myself in more pain it would make it more likely that I get help and thus increase the chance of a positive outcome."
776,What does this sound like?,"[Would like to here some ideas so I could research into them further.]

 Stumbled across this subreddit looking for answers as to why I have violent thoughts with no anger or stress being the trigger. I don’t necessarily enjoy or fear these thoughts, but they’re pretty interesting to think about. I don’t act on these thoughts, for 1: I don’t want to get arrested, and 2: because blood is pretty gross. 

I isolate myself, mostly because of the fact that interacting with people. When I feel stressed, it just gives me a bigger reason to do so. Removing extra stress is ideal for me. 

I lack empathy for the most part. There was an instance where I encouraged one of my friends to commit suicide because I’d told him some really personal stuff. It’s my fault that I used him as a diary, but I was experiencing paranoia because I don’t like the lack of control I have over my experiences being kept in secrecy after sharing them. 

I have faked a suicide attempt in order to distract my friends from learning that I lied about something pretty big. I wasn’t looking for pity, really. 

I am a pathological liar at times. I used to lie because of my self esteem issues, but now I just lie because I’m bored. I lie about my identity, and have been a catfish ever since I had access to the internet. 

Self care/ hygiene has always been a big issue for me. I’ve never had that healthy of a diet nor had good hygiene. Ever. I don’t walk around smelling like ass, but it’s obvious when I’m not taking care of myself. 

I don’t lack emotions, but I don’t experience them deeply. When I do, the duration of those feelings are very short and it usually feels like a feeling- a certain pressure somewhere in my body. The strongest emotion I feel and have ever felt was anxiety. 

I don’t know if I’m delusional, honestly. If I am, it would be pretty easy to accept. The human mind is weird. 

Also, I’m a female. I don’t know if this matters, but I’m just putting this out there."
777,I don't have thoughts or feelings anymore??,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety for about 5 years, and was finally diagnosed a few months ago. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced what I am right now, and if so, what you did to help.

I just don't have any thoughts or feelings anymore. Even when I'm meant to be enjoying myself, I don't have any emotions. The only way I can feel any sort of emotion is when I do drugs, which I'm trying not to use as a form of self medication right now.

When I'm alone and not doing any particular task, my mind is completely blank. No thoughts, nothing. It's disturbing and really concerning because I used to be thinking 24/7 and now it takes so much effort just to think. It's terrifying.

Nothing I've tried has helped me to feel again. I've tried picking up old hobbies again, trying new things, seeing friends, meditation, exercise, etc. No matter what I do, I'm just totally blank in a way I've never experienced before. I've dealt with feeling numb and empty, this is somehow different. Before, I could at least think without huge amounts of effort. Now, I can do nothing and not have a single thought for hours and not even register it. I'm just... blank, but in the most painful way possible.

Has anyone else dealt with this? If so, how did you improve your situation?"
778,Tips for social anxiety,"Some find it difficult to go ahead and talk. Go to gatherings like social events, parties, meet new people, talk to them, deliver a well-prepared presentation, these are some of the opportunities that are very difficult for some. When a school teacher or office boss asks a question, he knows the answer but cannot answer. This has happened to you too. You too may be trapped and scared. This is in general, said to be unsettling. 

1.CHALLENGE YOUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS. 
You need to be very careful about the negative thoughts that come to your mind. Because you need to identify those negative thoughts that come up at that time and remove them from your mind.

2.SLOW BREATHING.
Practice breathing slowly, consciously, and deeply. When there is social anxiety we usually take short breaths. Then our brain does not get the amount of oxygen it needs. 

3.COOKIE JAR Concept.
A cookie jar is a jar full of cookies stored for home cooking. The cookie jar concept is to store the achievements we have achieved in life like a collection of cookies in a cookie jar and keep them in our minds.

4.WRITE EVERY DAY.
This method has been very useful to me. You can even keep a diary if you want. It doesn’t matter if you were distracted at the time of writing. Keep writing. When you write like that, you can see the reasons for the oppression in the heart. It will help a lot to calm the mind.

5.DAILY EXERCISE
Live an active life every day. Especially before you go to a social event, exercise well, level up your energy, clean up, and go to the event happily.

6.FEEL THE FEAR BUT DO IT ANYWAY
Fighting face to face with your anxiety. Find and face the moments when you are afraid and you run away. You have your problems until you face them. So Feel the Fear but do it Anyway.

So be mindful of your thoughts as a whole. Because your thoughts are your habit. So this anxiety is something you are constantly accustomed to. But the good news is that we can change any habit."
779,Would anyone like to share their story?,I have an Instagram page and I’m looking for people to share their mental health journeys! Message me if this is something you are interested about and I’ll give you some more information!
780,This probably sounds really weird,Basically my sister copies me in EVERYTHING and NO it’s not because she looks up to me at all but even the smallest thing aswell like I suggested taking a certain food to college instead cos I’m sick of eating chips and stuff and she’s copying me and with other things to like going to the same college and uni and same job and it makes me feel soo suffocated and when I feel like that I feel suicidal even more and feel like I can’t get away from anything and I can’t do anything and I just cry and want to die and I don’t even know exactly why I no it’s sound soooo pathetic and you can say I’m overreacting because maybe I am but I don’t know why
781,Finally I made lockdown selfcare vlog to keep challenge me to be in track on life,"Last year especially end of last year has been extremely painful. 
As several lockdown on goes by my plans has been collapsed.
 So I set my own simple checklist for myself and it kept on for 3 months till now. Was suprising.
I think I was able to manage the hardest feeling and my body through notetaking. 
I made this channel to check on myself and hope it can help others to check on theirselves when we are all far away.

 It was my new years goal and I really did it.
Probably I managed to keep my first promise since I am obsessed with promises due to my past. I hope could keep on doing this!

It shows how Im dealing indoors and staying safe in this pandemic.
 I already feel encouraged to do more by just uploading my first video. 
Take care stay safe everyone.

782,Caught in a rock and a hard place.,"So I basically keep going through cycles of self destruction with alcohol, bad choices, anxiety and depression to moments of fleeting contentment. I’m toying with the idea of going back on anti-depressants but so scared of the that initial couple of months of hell again. 

Plus my sexdrive all but disappeared on sertraline, I don’t want to keep playing with the chemicals in my head. I’m also in the middle of training for a marathon and being bed ridden isn’t a option. 

I’m in therapy just unsure of what to do next, I can’t keep on like I am yet I don’t feel strong enough to keep going with a new medication. My problem is I can’t afford to keep going to therapy also!!!! I’m in a proper catch-22."
783,"I have realized that my prime reason for unhappiness have been keeping the locus of self-worth to external validation. I just want to be confident about my skills, body, decisions, experiences and actions. Is it possible at 31 years old? Any advice?","Since childhood and till my undergraduate degree, my self worth has been tied to my academic achievements, my parents income, the validation from teachers, friends and other relatives. I did not get the undergrad university or engineering branch of my liking, I tied my self-worth to it. I believed myself lesser than my colleagues in other fields of engineering. 

This feeling of low self-worth aggravated after flunking my exams in 2nd year of engineering. This feeling was somewhat subdued when I cleared a tough exam to get a place in a top university for my masters degree.

However, the feeling came gushing back when I found myself competing with brilliant fellow grad students. I felt that I did not belong there as I was from low ranked university while they had top-notch pedigree. This affected my job search after masters. I took the first job I was offered, in fear that I won't get anything better. It was a low paying, non ideal job. I could've got something better if I had searched more.

I always wanted to do a PhD and I loved doing research. I applied for several positions, got just one. Again not my first choice. I went for it but got unenthusiastic upon starting the program. I felt unequipped for the PhD. Ideally, I was required to take multiple courses (maths, numerical methods, mechanics), but I got flashbacks from my undergrad when I flunked the courses. As a result, I decided to go with self study. 

My advisor did not object nor did my committee. I thought I had made the right decision. However, fast forward 5 years, I have tied my self-worth to not having done those courses. I feel I lack basic fundamentals for not taking those courses. 

I am a postdoc now, and I want to be an academic. But now my self-worth is tied to not having done courses, not being serious enough during my PhD and not getting awards during my PhD. Now my self worth is also intertwined with my ability to get a date or working towards getting into a relationship.

I have realized that my prime reason for unhappiness have been keeping the locus of self-worth to external validation. I am unhappy because I feel constant regrets for my past experiences and decisions. Those regrets also reek of the need for external validation. ""Getting an A would have certified my ability to do a good job in PhD. Getting published in reputed journals will indicate competence. Should have got a better job as my earning potential reflects on my self-worth.""


I want to be free from keeping my self-worth centered on external validation. I want to be confident in my decisions, experiences and actions. Is it possible? I am 31 years old now. Is it too late to change?"
784,Diagnosis before exams (UK),"I am suspected of a few mental health conditions however when I attempted to get a diagnosis I was told to wait I am currently waiting on ADHD and an ASD, it’s been months and I understand due to the corona virus many things are put on hold but I desperately want, and need to get a diagnosis before my exams as they affect me significantly enough that it could result in me missing a grade just barely and I want as much help as I can get such as extra time etc. My exams were supposed to be in may
However they were delayed by a couple of weeks to some time in June and every day I hope they are delayed further so that I can get the help I need.

He's basically upset at me that they want to give me either medical or put me in a clinic. So he wants me to say something along the lines like ""I was lying the whole time"", ""everything is better now"", etc, etc. Otherwise he's gonna be even more upset and disappointed with me, and we're probably gonna have an argument/fight over this in the evening.

786,Anxiety makes me scared of everything,"Hi,

I’m always paranoid that I’m going die or something bad is going to happen me, this is usually stuff happening outside the house such as walking down a pathway, crossing the road etc. I can’t even take a train to the city without thinking that I’m going to murdered, kidnapped, run over etc. 

I know these are just fears everyone feels on occasion but it floods my mind with fear."
787,i'm not sure if this is normal.,"hello, everyone! i wanted to quickly write this post as a means of gaining information that i don't know how to find on google. when i look up my experiences, i often find nothing. i'm not even sure HOW to search for this. every once in a while i get this strange feeling. it's like a mindset that clings to me, and then goes away, and i'm not sure if it's normal or not.

it all started when i was a little girl, probably around 7, and i would fantasise about torturing mermaids. it was always a rather ""cartoony"" scenario, because i was so young and didn't yet have the visual library to imagine a scenario that included such gory imagery. but it wasn't really about the imagery. it was all about the mermaid's screams for help, and begs for mercy. the helplessness. these fantasies would always alleviate this strange feeling. i had a fairly normal childhood. i showed no agressive behaviours. i felt no agressive emotions outside of this strange power fantasy. i was no without power in my life, either. not abused, not mistreated, not belittled. never bullied. i was happy, and normal.

the only way i can describe this feeling, is as if everyone in the world thinks that they are better than me, but i think that i am better than everyone else, and the only way to prove my superiority is through torturous violence. i don't THINK these things, i FEEL these things. it's hard to explain. it's not a delusion, even when i feel the feeling, i KNOW that everyone doesn't see me as inferior. it's kinda like a strange hole in my chest, and it makes me hate everyone and everything. it makes me see any sort of human practice, like social functions, sexual intercourse, or simply making friends, as stupid, and cringe- along with any sort of human emotion. but when i feel this way, the thought of committing acts of detailed violence against anyone brings me content, and calms this black hole in my chest.

i hadn't felt the feeling for years, but for a bit now, it's been coming back, and now that i'm 16, i'm starting to identify it as out of the ordinary. the only thing about the feeling that has changed, is that i now feel more aggression surrounding it. i only feel this way when i'm alone. i almost always snap out of it when i interact with people. i am not worried about me hurting myself, or others. the only real harm that this feeling had ever caused me to conduct, was when one of my friends was texting me during one of these ""episodes"", and i was kind of rude to him. i now don't respond to texts when i feel this way.

when i'm not feeling this way, i have a very normal and fulfilling life. i have an identity, great friends whom i love dearly, aspirations, many hobbies, and decent grades. so this isn't tearing me apart at the seams, but that doesn't mean i don't want to find out more about it. if there's a word for it. i already know how to deal with this feeling, but i kind of want to hear if other people have experienced this, as everyone whom i've spoken to about this lowkey thought i was crazy. thanks!"
788,hallucinating often (is it normal? orr?),"I've been hallucinating since I was a kid, and I've never really told anyone, except for my friends.
Whenever I tell my parents, or ask them if I can see a doctor, they tell me that everyone hallucinates, and that I'm just an attention-seeker. They tell me to grow up and that their life is much more difficult than mine. 
I've recently had very scary and vivid hallucinations, and they've made me stop leaving my room, and cut off contact with people.
Normally they're just voices in my head, or these strange rotting robots with animal-like features. Sometimes demons with no skin, its strange.
Sometimes I have to skip lessons in school, or pretend to be ill to skip school because of how bad the hallucinations are. 
When I was 12, I attempted suicide because they were so scary and overwhelming, on top of a few other things going on.
But my parents kept telling me that there was nothing wrong with me. 
And since then I've attempted suicide about 4 times, and I know that that's not normal. 
Everytime, my parents tell me that I'm fine, and to just go get a plaster to cover my scars and wounds. 
Since I was 11 I've been cutting and burning myself to cope, and I know that it isn't good at all. 

I just want to know what to do now.
My parents wont let me see a doctor, the rest of my family don't believe me, and my friends just tell me to get a doctor, but I can't.
Does anyone know what I can do to get help? because I'm starting to think that there's nothing left for me.
(I'm from the UK, if that helps at all)"
789,I'm destroying everything I love,"First off. 

Second off my therapist I was with for 3 years had come to the conclusion, and diagnosed me with dipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ocd, anger, manic depression, panic disorder, ptsd, generals anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, slight adhd, I'm not saying these are extreme, I could write a separate post of it, it's kind of crazy, we did history my dad's side of the family had a bunch of mental illness's, my great uncles all three of them committed suicide over ""hearing voices"" ""depression"" etc. My most worst is bipolar disorder and anger. Anyways onward

I grew up in an unhealthy home, my mom always worked, my sister took care of my while my abusive drunk father played video games and neglected us. He hurt us, sexualized up. I don't want to get to deep into it.

Two years ago I went from Illinois to Montana. I loved Montana so much when I got there all my mental illness's seemed to stop existing. I felt free, my first job my mom hired me at a Halloween store, helped with my socialize anxiety and I became a good working, and did school. There was this guy who my mom liked and hired on as our assistant manager, for safety reasons, we will call him mason. 

Mason was a hard worker and did his job to the T, I ended up working nightshift with him and we both learned the two of us are huge into video games, anime and more. We didn't start talking until another relationship had ended, a few weeks went by and we were going on dates out the wazoo, the first guy to ever actually ask me out. We went to hot springs, movies, hiking, walking around a park campus where he encouraged me to be healthier, and I stopped so many pounds I would be walking 10,000 steps a day and it felt amazing. He turned my life around, I was driving, working, schooling, had a great boyfriend my relationship with my step dad was okay, everything was great, my aha moment came. I still had days where I had normal 17-year-old stressed and bits of moodiness but that was only if I strayed from my medicine 

I was informed in March at the time, we were moving and everything crashed. Mason said he would move with me but my parents didnt want his dogs coming, he said he couldn't go if his dogs couldnt come he couldn't abandon them like that. He ended up leaving his big dog with his mom, and brought his tiny seizure loved fat doggo named mamma, I love her. 

We moved from Montana all the way to virginia. And the whole way I couldn't even enjoy the 300 dollar hotel I payed for. The most beautiful hotel I've ever stayed in, that I was able to pay for 75% on my own (my mom helped but that night my step sister also given me $150~ so that money went back to me to help with the move. But it was arguments and I went off on Nathan because my parents dogs, had a big brown accident in their expensive hotel room and my mom was crying and stressed out because the dogs were stressed and kept having accidents, Nathan was laughing (which I learned today he laughs when he gets nervous or if something goes wrong and it's ironic.) I got mad at him and told him he could EFF off back to Montana he was being rude and disrespectful. He got pretty upset because other than one other fight we had on the phone over the dog situation, I had never sad anything to mean. I went back to our room,took a shower. That's when my step sister came we ate and slept. He fell asleep, and we never even had sexual interaction, which we had done it almost every night leading up to. It felt aweful without him, but I was restless and took care of momma seizing because ei didn't want to wake him.

Everything is a mess we've been in virginia a year. Everything is ruined... We use to talk our problems our, but I just play video games as a coping mechanism, hoping the days will pass by faster till the day I can go back to Montana confidently. I'm so pissy and angry, I'm mean and start fights even if mason is, ya know, picking his nose, (I get that's totally normal), or small stupid stuff like constantly touching his face, I get pissed off and smack his hand away. I'm so controlling I'm mean, I use to drive everywhere, (I had to sell my car in montana) and I never get out of my parents dark unfinished basement, I'm tired, depressed eating so much, I work 10 hour night shifts at amazon, and I never get daylight... We recently came up with the idea to move back to Montana finally in April. But something's holding me back I know I want to go there but my mom.. I'm scared... 

But if I don't do something to help myself get happy, my relationship is gonna flop. I love him, I miss our intimate days. I don't enjoy sex I avoid it all the time. I don't watch movies I just play games, more games, games and games. 

I was on and off my medicine multiples months. I'm finally weening myself back on them.

Ugh...

I woke up this morning... Alone... Usually I have a body there to hold me but it was cold. 

He wasn't anywhere, but got a message saying he went to go sleep on the couch. Said the love he has for me is slowly starting to erode, because of how I act, how mean and controlling I am... I know this I won't deny it, he isn't being manipulative he is right 100% something in me had changed... If I don't find help I'm going to lose everything.

I can try to get better but I know by next week be the same.excuse me,what the fuck do I do I'm sobbing through blurry eyes, I just want things to back back to normal, I was t to be happy, confident and have my good relationship back, I want sex like we use to, I want to feel....

I feel like I'm drowning... I'm drowning so fast and I can't get out of this... What do I do, what's wrong with me nothing I do seems to help, I know playing games does this, but there's nothing to do in virginia, not like I thought there would be. I miss hiking, I miss hot springs, I miss montana, could this move really be the reason why I am the way I am? Is it something else? I've tried finding therapy here. But nothing...

I always remember him telling me he loved me secretly since we started working together, he loved me unconditionally he said.he would ways think about me... I'm ruining this man. I'm hurting him, I don't want to quit, nothing is working... Nothing..."
790,i need advices to manage my life with depression,"okay i'm new to reddit and not so sure of how to... reddit

(+ english is not my natural language so sorry if i sound like a 4 years old with few vocabulary and weird sentences)

i don't know how to start, i struggle with mental health, i started to see psychiatrists 1 year ago and i'm on meds (i recently increased the dose, again), i moved twice since last year + one of my psychiatrist moved out too, so i had 4 psychiatrists i total

they were all pretty sure that i'm depressed and have anxiety, but some of them supposed that i could be bipolar

anyways, i struggle with almost everything, i'm a student and have no concentration, i can't find the courage to study nor to stop my studies, my parents (i moved back with them since classes are from home) are constantly pressuring me to ""be more violent with myself"", because they believe the less i work, the less i will be able to

even for dance, which i love, i can't find the motivation to practice or even just stretch, it's not just about work or studies

all i seem able to do i play animal crossing and read webcomics in my bed, and sometimes pausing cause even for that i can't f\*\*\*\*\*\* concentrate

&amp;#x200B;

but i don't want to stop my studies, and i'm so scared of doing nothing and live the rest of my life like that, i often think of just disapearing (like not existing anymore) but without killing myself it's seem impossible, and i'm not sure i could even gather the courage to do this

everything seems so hard, but the life is not slowing itself because of my little a\*\* and i'm so desperate i need advices on how to keep going with my life, i don't know maybe on concentration (classic methods don't work with me, i already tried), or motivation or i don't know

791,I can't breath,"I'm 23 and I'm the oldest daughter in a family of seven. Despite being the oldest, my sister got a job already. We started studying at the same time and both got into a good university. She took a 4 year course BS in Mathematics while I took a 5 year course BS in Electrical Engineering so she graduated earlier. Now, she was able to have a steady job as a Math Professor while I'm still reviewing for a Licensure Exam. Because of pandemic, all my plans was destroyed and end up staying longer at home. I have nothing against her, I was actually very thankful since she helps in paying things at home. But, everytime I made a mistake at home, my parents will always compare us. It's making me lose my mind again. When I'm still studying at universities, I did self harm. I sometimes cut my wrist and wear big watches so I can hide it. And sometimes I cut where it was difficult to see like the lower part of my shoulder near my breast and I was able to stop it before it get worse but now I'm getting ideas again. My home is not a safe space for me anymore. I just can't breathe. I don't know what to do."
792,"Feeling grief, guilt and sadness due to sister with schizophrenia","TW: Schizophrenia, mention of suicide

My (20F) sister (26F) has had schizophrenia for a few years now, as well as some other mental illnesses (such as bipolar disorder and depression) and it started with a psychotic episode 7 or so years ago. She'd been in and out of the hospital for some time in between (mostly due to depression, suicidal tendencies etc), but no psychotic episodes since the first time.

This Christmas, she opened up to me about what she was experiencing and proceeded to tell me about some conspiracies (which I could recognise as symptoms of her schizophrenia this time, as opposed to the first time) she was convinced were true. The thing was, I was supposedly not allowed to tell anyone about this, as it could ruin the ""scheme"". The first time I actually didn't, as I was a child and didn't know what was going on, but this time in fear of her own safety, I did.

I kept it secret in fear of my own safety for a couple of days in hopes of controlling the situation by making sure she took all of her pills after a week of a ""break"", but things didn't get better. I told the rest of the family and we agreed the best thing would be for her to get help at the psychiatric hospital again.

On NYE she told me that if something didn't happen until midnight, that she would commit suicide because she ""couldn't live like this anymore"". I knew then that it was absolutely imperative that I manage to persuade her into going to the hospital. 

After the worst new year's ever, I did. I made up some story that went hand in hand with some theories and maybe made her falsely believe some things (while telling her honestly that she may stay at the hospital for more than one night in order to ""test this theory""). And all of a sudden she wanted to go straight away. While we were packing for the hospital, she broke down because ""what if all of this isn't real"". I almost lost it. Before she left, she hugged me extremely tight and said that I'm the best sister for helping her test this. After making her falsely believe that a part of her theory might happen if she went to the hospital, I'm not so sure I am. 

She's called me from the hospital multiple times in these 4 days to update me on further progressions in the ""theory"". My heart breaks for her and I can't imagine living with an illness that quite literally makes you question reality.

Is it normal for me to feel some sort of PTSD after all of this or am I being overdramatic? I've cried endlessly about this over the past couple of days. I love her more than anything just want her to be herself again."
793,How can one stop being emotional and have tears in their eyes for the silliest of things?,"I had a very tough childhood growing up and have always been a strong girl. However, in the past 2 years I went through a lot of changes. I feel like I cry for the pettiest things and am just very emotional in general. I have never been this way, how can I deal with this? I practice meditation and go on early morning walks but it hasn't helped. I cannot afford a therapist."
794,People who've been in therapy-,"I've been diagnosed with moderate depression and have been on medications for about 45 days, prior to this I went for therapy for two months and continued it after medications started, I do not know if the therapy seems to be working/not, sometimes I feel fine, sometimes I get irritated by it and angry for days, so far she's told she hasn't started the actual therapy yet so I didn't understand what I did for two months, but my thinking wasn't clear before medications. I don't really understand the process of therapy completely, I understand my psychiatrist better and mostly go to him to clear my doubts, I never actually worked on anything in therapy, mostly just talk about my week every consultation, it was only once a week, so basically we didn't cover about my past or anything. Can anyone who's been in therapy share their experience or tell me when I'll know it's not working out and have to change psychologists? Any answer is appreciated. :)"

Hey, first time posting because this ones important to me

M17 6Ft3 bulky build (it will make sense why im including height later)

So im just a regular college student (UK) has two friend groups and people i can really trust and people that i know care for me, never had any relationship all my life which is something i think about alot, dont know of thats a bad thing?

Im generally bigger than most people i meet and i always have this hollow feeling in my stomach, like i cant really put it into words but i just feel empty, i see all these couples around and i can see how happy they are and i wanna be one of those people but i cant, i dont want sex i dont want money i just wanna be held by someone who loves, and thats something ive never felt and it hurts

any idea how i can ease these emotions or something similar?"
796,Can College Burnout Do This?,"For context: I’m a college graduate as of 2020 who struggles with anxiety, depression, epilepsy, and “OCD tendencies” (quoting the doctors, here). While I haven’t had traumatic incidents in my life that would warrant any of these problems, I’ve had my fair share of toxic relationships along with run-ins with racism, homophobia, transphobia, and sexism.

As of January 4th, 2021, I’m struggling with mysterious symptoms sparked by a bout of college burnout back in 2019. Such symptoms are difficulty reading, remembering, retaining information, and organizing my thoughts. I’ve been told by doctors and peers alike to just power through because it’s only temporary, but the symptoms have gotten worryingly worse:

* I’m unable to read for fun or for more than \~15 minute periods without getting headaches.
   * I mix up the words often, resulting in me needing to reread sentences.
   * I can hardly remember things I just read, which also makes me have to reread sentences.
   * I had to use text-to-speech websites to get through senior year of college.
   * I can’t read subtitles fast enough anymore.
   * I can’t stay on social media with text posts for long.
* I have trouble speaking because I can’t form clear thoughts, and because I trip over my words a lot.
* I can hardly remember goals I set or instructions I was given just moments ago, no matter how small they were.
* I can’t do mental math or calculate time anymore.
* I get information overload easily.
   * Meaning I can hardly hold an in-person conversation anymore because I can’t retain everything someone told me.
   * I can hardly watch movies or long videos anymore.
   * I can’t marathon my favorite shows anymore.
* I forget to do basic necessary things.
   * Forgetting to brush my teeth, shower, wash my face.
   * Forgetting to make memos and alarms to remind me to do things.
   * Which also feeds my OCD tic of feeling compelled to triple-check everything.

I’ve only been able to navigate through a few of these problems by making memos and using text-to-speech websites for everyday tasks, but, as I said before, I forget to make those memos and I can hardly retain any information, even in audio form.

At this point, I’m wondering if I just became the first person ever to contract dyslexia or ADHD from college like it’s a disease (being sarcastic)."
797,Now what?,"This is my first post on the internet about my mental health. I suffered depression &amp; social anxiety for a little over a year now, it's been hard, I've attempted ""it"" twice in the span of Jan-March 2020 (so before covid hits my country). I struggled in uni because of this, so i got dropped out in July 2020, it was especially hard because not only do i experience this, I'm also scared to tell this to anyone. COVID fucks me up inside &amp; outside, i cant talk to anyone to the point that I literally (no exaggeration) lost all my friend except one, that was my girlfriend. 

After August, i got into a new uni, and started getting into cycling, at first it was great! i felt insanely good about both my mental health and my physical health. and then it hits, in October i got some kind of anxiety attack? idk, i just never feel so scared. i think its the combination of the begining of raining season (i dont know why i feel fucked everytime we enter raining season) and just anxious about my grade. to the point, i feel crazy, i cant talk to anyone, the only one who i can talk to (which was my girlfriend) was in a pretty intense dorm (can rarely chat) so this piles up. 

Midst December, my girlfriend broke up with me, we've been together for 3 years, and it just ended. She left saying i need to fix my mental health because it fucked her up too, which i understand. But after that, my mental health just went downhill, noone to talk to, surely i cant live like this forever? Ive already attempted it twice this year (&amp; its just been 4 days! i know, its crazy). So here i am, in reddit, basically just want to talk to anyone about the experience ive had for a little over a year now. I'm now in the middle of final exam week and its been killing me (literally?), i just wish it can be over man, its so hard."
798,"Simple question, yet it still frustrates me.","How do I tell whether or not I truly want to do a particular thing for my own enjoyment or betterment, or if I'm doing it because somebody says I should do it. Whether that's somebody else, or myself. Obviously chores/responsibilities like housework and schoolwork are simply things you have to deal with. But for example, something like my career choice. I've been so frustrated and confused because I don't really know myself that well."
799,Addicted to socializing? Any one else struggling with this?,"Honestly yeah I think I'm addicted to socializing and it's a real problem

I've had big issues with my career because of chronic anhedonia which is ironically the inability to feel pleasure, meaning or joy from things, and as I have tackled that I have begun to rely on social situations for that support

The problem is now that I can't bear the idea of not making a  social event or being alone for too long and thats getting in the way of my career which is predominantly evening work when people are free to socialize.

I really can't get over the idea of having to work when people are free to socialize in an evening

But because of my chronic anhedonia and my career options in general I can't handle a different job right now because it's vital for me to find meaning in my work and to do something I enjoy somewhat or I just won't last in it or may get suicidal again so... 

Has anyone struggled with this? What did you do?"
800,Update,"Im not too sure what to say right now. Reddit has always been a very personal place for me, somewhere i can scream my thoughts into the void without any response or judgement. Recently my mind is becoming foreign, i dont feel very safe in my own head, like im at a strangers house.  I look at myself and think ’Jesus, what a freak, that girl needs help”. I know i need help, but at the same time i dont feel like i deserve it, like im faking all of my problems. Af if, if i just really thought about it, i could force myself to be normal. I also see a lot of people saying that getting help is “for yourself” and you should be “doing it for you”.. but i fuckin hate myself, the only reason i want to get better is because i feel really bad for my boyfriend. I dont know what he see’s in me nowdays, and why he stays is a complete mystery to me. His life would be so much easier if I wasn’t in it. I know he’s probably reading this. But anyway, thats why i want to get better, for him. He’s my whole world, yunno? This year, im going to really try. I miss who i was before i twitched when i was anxious, before i froze up and pintched myself when i was stressed, i miss who i was when i wanted to do something with my life. 2020 ripped a lot of me away, but now im going to try to get it back."
801,"Question about what is considered ""toxic behavior""","I've been doing a lot of reading about toxic behavior. 

One article (I don't remember the source) said that a toxic person will need constant validation. Validation meaning that they're likable, good, etc. 

I can understand where someone might get tired of validating somebody but is that really toxic behavior? Low self-esteem, sure, but toxic?"
802,Does anyone else pull out their hair?,"I can’t stop, I have one bald spot now, I’m so strssed so I keep pulling out my hair"
803,Not having a girlfriend is making me so miserable,"I've always had a hard time with women for my entire life, which at first didn't bother me that much. However for the last year or two, it's giving me so much headache. As I'd guess for a lot of us, stuff like that is also getting much harder because of covid. I'm already seeing a therapist to speak about that and it helps for sure, I just feel like it is not doing enough. Maybe a change of perspective helps and someone on here has an idea on how to handle this.

This always comes in like some sort of phases, where I feel miserable. They seem to come and go as they please. The current phase lasts since 3 weeks if I recall correctly. During these, all I can think of is that I want to be in a relationship so bad. No matter what I do in my freetime, it will always be overshadowed by this overwhealming need for companionship. There's always this thought that I'd rather be with my girlfriend right now, if I'd had one, instead of do whatever I am doing in that moment. I can't enjoy things I enjoyed in the past at all anymore (like videogames, meeting friends or physical activities) - don't even get me started on every day life. I developed trouble sleeping, can't motivate myself to do laundry, study or even get up in the morning most of the time. I don't feel like eating, although I'm hungry. I'm just sitting around pitying myself and trying to do some random stuff like watching Youtube or Netflix in order to get my head off of these negative thoughts for maybe five minutes.

All I can think of is that I finally want to be in a relationship with someone. I feel like other people have it so much better than me, just because they got one and I don't. Why does it have to be so hard for me when others seem to be getting into amazing relationships by pure chance? It's not like I'm not trying or not putting myself out there. I just never have luck or something.

My therapist suggested that I start to write down these negative thoughts and then write down some positive counterparts, which only seems to work short term for me. She also told me, that I should treat myself or spend time with things I like or with friends. But how am I supposed to do that and expect something to change if these things don't make me feel better anymore?

I just want to feel happy again and not worry so much about being in a relationship. Life has so much more to offer, I just want to enjoy what I got instead of feeling miserable about myself. Even while writing this, I myself see, that I in fact don't have it that bad in life, but for some reason I can't seem to keep these in perspective. The negative stuff always gets through to me way more. I'm not even looking forward to stuff anymore, it just seems so pointless because I feel bad before and I'll feel bad afterwards anyways."
804,How can I help my mom??,"My mother is suffering from depression i think because for 6 months now she always says that her life is meaningless and she wants to die. 
Today i looked up her search history on her phone and she googled a few times “how can you die from medication overdose” . I got really stressed out because of this. I love her so much

I talked to her a lot But i dont know how to Really help her! I suffered from depression a year ago as well so i understand her feelings But I dont know What to do. 


I was strong enough to overcome depression on my own But i dont know if my mom is strong enough. Please help give me advices! She doesnt want to visit psychologist."
805,"After years of struggling with my decreasing health, I’m getting better :)","Hello! I’m only now learning how to use Reddit so I’m sorry if there are any mistakes. 

This is also a vent as well, but I don’t think I can put two labels on this post.

Ever since my parents got divorced, when I was around 3-4, I was always aware of this black cloud that hung over me but never paid attention to it until I was at least 11.
That’s when I was bullied. I had toxic friends and an awful living environment with my Dad that included emotional abuse. The only thing that kept me sane was that my Mum would call me. Every. Single. Day. Asking me how I am, staying up to talk with me, encouraging me to just hang on until she can come and get me. At the time I thought, yeah, whenever that was.

School was bad. I was severely depressed and had such bad anxiety that it affected my daily life. I hardly moved from my bed when I got home and was glued to my screen because I couldn’t muster the energy to do anything else. 

Peers called me fat, ugly, commented on my appearance. It was, as you can imagine, not a safe space for my mental health and self worth. My Dad, though he was there financially, he was never there emotionally. I was isolated in his home, except for my Mum.

Things happened, and I ended up moving to my Mum’s. Which was amazing. She loves me and supports me, got me psychologist appointments weekly, then on to medication which has helped me a lot! 

Though I can sometimes dip into darker thoughts and my anxiety will always be with me, I have genuinely improved. I’ve made it a task to wake up every day and compliment myself in the mirror. I am positive about my body and overall am starting to love myself. 

Not just from medication, but because of the safe and loving environment my Mum and stepdad have been able to give me. Thanks for reading. 💕"
806,Lately I have been staying in bed most of the day,"Hi, basically I'm staying in bed reading manga/manhwa and not doing anything else for the past 3 weeks. Since it's my holidays before the 2nd semester. I have no physical or mental energy to do anything especially today, I dont even want to talk its soo much work. There are so many things that I want to do but I feel exhausted and super depressed and overwhelmed. I got diagnosed and started anti depressants 2~ months ago, it helped but sometimes it's like it has no effect. Didn't eat for almost 24 hours because I didnt want to get up when I felt hungry. I want to at least do one activity a day weather it be drawing something or walking or riding the bicycle, I feel better when I do aerobic exercises in parks/nature but I cant get myself up. If you have anything that can help me or if you have been in the same situation, please tell me I hate being like this."
807,what is wrong with me???,"I’ve always felt different ever since I was young. Throughout the years, I had people(kids and adults) say stuff to me like “you’re weird” or “you’re special” and it’s made me feel alienated from everyone. I don’t connect with folks my age, I have trouble with caring for others, and my lack of life skills will probably be my downfall once I head into adulthood after high school. I started going to therapy this year and I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I feel like there’s something else too. I feel like it might be ADHD due to my attention difficulties and poor emotional regulation, but my therapist might not think this is the case. There is a whole buttload of stuff that is wrong with me, but it’s kind of hard to put down every single thing, so I just summed it up."
808,"My fiance was shot, he's in the hospital","I woke up this morning to a call from my mom. She told me my fiance called her and said he was in the hospital because he was shot in the back, he told her not to tell me. Of course she told me and came to pick me up and drove me to the hospital. Because of covid I can't see him until this afternoon. All they told me was that he's stable at the moment and might need surgery. I'm still trying to grasp what happened and this feeling of dread won't go away. I feel like I can't breathe and I can't stop thinking about it. I can't handle this."
809,Is that ADHD or or daydreaming?,Sometimes I loose my atention bc I am imagening or thinking about my life or future too much and don't know what others say like I don't orientate. For example when teacher says something to do I always miss some parts or when explaining something i just sudenly start to think about my life.
810,"Everyone, please help us end the shortage of the MAOI anti-depressant Nardil (phenelzine Sulfate)","**Please go to this link to sign the petition:** [https://www.change.org/p/end-the-shortage-of-the-maoi-anti-depressant-nardil-phenelzine-sulfate](https://www.change.org/p/end-the-shortage-of-the-maoi-anti-depressant-nardil-phenelzine-sulfate)

Nardil works when all other treatments have failed. The majority of people on Nardil have treatment-resistant biological (endogenous) depression and/or severe anxiety disorders. They have often trialed the TCA antidepressants, the newer SSRI and SNRI antidepressants, and even electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)- all without any success. **Therefore, Nardil is the ONLY drug that works for them, and without it, they would not be able to function or, sadly, would take their own lives.**  

As a result of this global shortage, thousands of people, who have either had to cease Nardil or substantially reduce their dose, are now suffering greatly. They have relapsed into depression and anxiety, and have often become suicidal.

**If action is not taken to remedy the shortage of Nardil, it is inevitable that many lives will be lost by suicide.** The Nardil shortage situation is becoming progressively worse. Many lives are hanging by a thread.

811,What do you do when you are alone in the world &amp; unsupported?,"What if you can’t even be there for yourself too because of your mental state? How do you get through life?

812,"15 year old boy, i think im struggling with BDD","Im starting to lose sleep over it, i cant stop taking pictures of my face and side profile and analyzing it, i keep comparing my face to celebrities or models and it's messing with my head, i know that those people are the top 1% in attractiveness but i cant help but feeling inferior to them, i have a normal face, everyone tells me i do, but i still cant stop seeing every single flaw in my face, i stay up at night wondering if im going to look like this forever instead of sleeping, i have broken down and started crying because i see models that look 10x better then me and i know ill never look like them, i just want to go back to not caring that im not a model, at this point it's starting to make me feel like less of a man, everyone ive talked to about this just tells me to man up or grow a pair, im starting to think there right, ive had countless people tell me that men cant even have BDD, are they right? I just wish i had someone to talk about this stuff without getting looked down on."
813,"Why do I want to kill myself every-time I have a panic attack, big or small?","This is getting out of control, one day I was planning killing myself for a good hour and a half before I got my senses back."
814,wasted my time overthinking all day,"I just wish I could make my mind shut up. My brain is more talkative than I am. I just want some peace, but nooo, thoughts keep popping up in my head. I hate it. I sometimes wish I have a detachable brain, so I could just remove it from it from my head.

It can get really scary when it's quiet, because that's when my thoughts go even more crazy."
815,Does anybody else not trust joy?,"I have a hard time accepting joy and feeling happy. Does anyone else feel this way?

I am not sure when this feeling started exactly, but I would say it’s been within the past 3-5 years. The last time I really, fully accepted a joyful moment that I can remember was my wedding day (I’ve been married 4 years). And I know what some people may be thinking, “It may be because you’re not happy in your marriage.” Let me dispel that quickly. My wife is my best friend, we don’t have any children and don’t plan on it. I am happy with my marriage.

I am more talking about when we are doing something fun or something that would bring most people joy. I feel happy for a little, but my Brain is always getting it’s 2 cents in and telling me something along the lines of:

“There’s no way you deserve this joy. Oh, and by the way, if you let your guard down and feel joyful, the world is going to snatch it away. You remember this, this, and this? Remember how you felt happy and then immediately something bad happened, and that joy you felt was cancelled out and destroyed by tragedy? Well, if you don’t feel joy, then you can’t be destroyed when something shitty inevitably happens.” 

It is very frustrating. And yes, there have been several events over the past few years that have destroyed a Joyful OP, but I wonder if that feeling wanes the older you get, when there are fewer things to worry about? 

Does anybody else feel this way? If so, what is your response to this feeling of the distrust of joy?"
816,How the hell do I ask my parents to send me to therapy?,I'll most likely wait until my mom is one of those really good moods. She's a lot more willing in those moods.
817,I’m 17 and think I’m struggling with bipolar disorder..,"So, I turned 17 around 8 months ago... I’m not sure if that helps anything but hear me out. 
First of all, take note, my mother has been diagnosed with Bipolar 1. So it does run in my family. 
Alright let’s get into this.
     My whole life I’ve struggled with emotions. Random moments of excitement, then random moments of no emotion. I’d get hyper focused on pointless things. But with age these random emotions shifted, they split. 
My early to now teen years I’d be extremely hyper doing everything. Going out and such for around two weeks. And then I’d get so depressed to the point where I began to self harm. 

Over the past 2 years (16-17yr) it’s gotten extreme. 
Instead of just hyper I become impulsive and self destructive. I’d go out and smoke with random people, I’d risk my life swallowing pills and having sex. It’s so outside of my regular modest personify. I’ll spend all on my money on a whim, which I’d never normally do because I’m a cheapskate and I’ll react with over kindness or pure aggression. 
Then I fall into a deep pit of self hate. Recently I was with someone. My brain just turned to mush and next thing I know I was running away and then I slit my wrists open and was bleeding out. I just did it? 
Or I’ll become very homicidal and kill animals, and plan on people. In order to combat that I’d just cut deep into my body and sit in my own blood? And then after a few weeks I’d be back to normal. As I am now. Then sooner or later, a few weeks overly hyper and energized. Seemingly immortal, then super down and in bed crying. Then few weeks later I’m back to myself... 

Wtf is this?"
818,"tired of trying to be strong, nothing feels right anymore","I rarely use reddit, but I have felt miserable for years, and I've just always been told to suck it up, people have it worse. I'm not those people. I want to better myself and am extremely tired of feeling like I do. Every day is the same miserable cycle, get up, get on pc, hangout with Discord friends, eat, sleep. There's sometimes events in between, but that's rare. An hour turns into 12, turns into ""its already 9 pm?"" Turns into days, then weeks, ""wait that happened a week ago?"". I have been seeing a therapist for 5 years now, but truly, the only reason I still see them is because its nice seeing a friendly familiar face who I know I can rely on. I've lost contact with everyone I used to know in person, friends are almost Discord exclusive anymore, and even then Discord friends are shakey. I have been diagnosed with depression, bipolar and aspergers, and have tried so many different medications over the years, they all led me to feel like a zombie, so I stopped them. I feel lonely no matter the situation as well, I can be surrounded with family, friends, whoever, and ill feel like I'm alone in a massive room."
819,Be careful who you agree to talk to.,"I think you know where I'm going with this but if you don't here the thing. 

There's a lot of people that prey in mental health circles with the sole intention to cause more damage or to recruit you into cults or radical political or idiollogical circles. They get advantage on your mental state, vulnerabilities, desires, and give you promises to make it better if you agree with them and help them in their cause. Some will make you feel worse in attempts to make you more miserable or more. 

Please check their background or post history to know if they they are actually good people at least. If they are getting a lot of dislikes or bad reputation there's probably a cause for it, it should tell you something about them. 

I know it's difficult to differentiate allies from foes, and that's part of the challenge. But try to be careful regardless. Maybe we don't have natural jungles anymore where there's chances that a tiger could kill and eat us, but our jungles are artificial now and there's still predators that feed on your condition and try to manipulate you for their benefit. Be careful out here. 

By: someone that has fallen for it too."
820,I just wanted to share and see if there is anyone else who shares some of the same feelings and what is your story.....,"I had another meltdown yesterday and this year has done a number on me mentally and emotionally.  I am 45 now and was on ADHD meds for 3.5 years.  and then 2020 hit and it felt like the meds were not working.  I got a MMJ card and started using cannabis for the first time in my life.    I had surreal moments and thought I was getting better but then George Floyd died and I spiraled into a deep depression. I am considered white but technically a mutt.  My dominate gene is Cherokee from both parents who divorced when I was 13.   


I went to a shrink who took me off Adderall,  upped my dose of Lexapro and Buspar back in August.  Two weeks later I had a disassociate fugue which was point blank a paranoid delusional episode where I thought god was talking to me through the TV and telling me to kill myself.  I never attempted to and told the voices in my head to fuck off.  I thought my dad was conspiring to kill me.  It was bad.  I remember everything too.  I told the shrink this and he made it like it was my fault which make me sink even further.  Even the therapist I have been talking to made me feel like my feelings didn't count.  It really did a number on me and my thoughts on western medicine.  


I ended up off work for 3 months with FMLA so I was still getting paid.  During that time, I got off my meds and felt like a new person.  I was doing great, seeing how beautiful the world was and everything while I was home.  Listing to more music and going for walks. Talking with some family on my moms side to get back in contact.  I was starving for any sort of emotional connection since the world was in ""lockdown"".    


However it was hell tying to come back to work and I felt like I was getting objectified or quite simply a ""cog in the machine"" so to speak. I felt misunderstood. Prior to all of this I thought I was living a pretty standard life until I saw the world we live in for what it is and it makes my heart hurt.  In the time I was home, I did a lot of soul searching and trying to discover who I am in this world and trying to ""fit in"".  I think I was doing my own form of CBT and music therapy.  I never knew these to be a thing either until I was doing my own form of self-diagnosis and trying to discovery my identity and/or character.

Like I said, I am 45 male living in the US.  I didn't have the greatest childhood,  got bullied, dad really wasn't in my life so my mother raised me and my sister. He never played catch with me, I remember teaching myself to ride a bike alone.  I don't even remember him going to any of my high school games.  I was not considered ""popular"" in school.  I was more associated with people from each group.  Never went to prom or any dances.  First time I drove a car was in drivers ED.  I knew of lots of girls that liked me but I never acted on it because I afraid.  Even looking back, I was so blind to it.  Girls saying they noticed me or just being nice.  Looking back now as an adult, they were flirting with me but I was scared to make a move.  I was afraid of rejection and wonder if that was because of my feeling of being rejected by my dad?  


Even though my dad would go and do stuff with my younger sister.  They still have a relationship to this day.  Oh and my father is also prejudice and recently found out my sister is as well.  They don't feel white privilege exists.  Its also why I never wanted to have kids.  I felt I was so fucked up from my childhood, I didn't want to bring a child into this world in fears I will just fuck it up the way I was treated.  


I had a great uncle who was my male role model growing up and was more like a father than my own biological dad.  I remember going to see my uncle when I was 7 with my aunt.  We were taking his lunch to him.  A couple hours later he ended up passing away at work so it was like losing my dad twice.

I was in the USAF when I was 21 and joined because I always wanted to.  Plus my uncle was in the USAF as well during the Korean war. Most get home sick but I felt home now. I had a couple seizures so I was medically discharged at 24.  I did have migraines as a kid but they never figured out why.  I just grew out of it but makes me wonder if that is what they were.     


While serving in the USAF there were rumor and I was asked point blank by a female airman if I was ""racist against white people?"".  I was with a black friend of mine at the time and it destroyed me inside but I just looked at my friend, looked back and her and laughed right in her face.  There were also untrue rumors that I steal guys girlfriends and sleep with them.   


I also started having sleep paralysis in my teens and still do but cant remember the last time I did.  It was either 2020 or 2019 that I remember the last episode but I know what it is so I didn't worry to much about it.  

I got married when I was 30 but divorced at 35.  I started training in Brazilin Jujitsu when I was 33 and kept at it. It did wonders for my confidence but I still had self doubts that I was not aware of.  Keep in mind this was all before I was on any sort of medication.  I ended up having to quit because of the racial ignorance there and the toxic mentality there.  Even though they promote anti-bullying, they feel white privilege doesn't exist.  So it destroyed me mentally and emotionally because I looked at them like my family.  


It was the fugue that caused me to hit rock bottom that day and address all of my fears, regrets and everyone that has ever hurt me.  I was pretty much going though my own self therapy if you will.  Peeling the layers of my self and trying to see how I fit in to this world even thought I thought I was living a normal life.  However I feel I have been ""asleep"" for most of my life, just keeping my head down or going with the flow.  


In all of that I took the MBTI.  I had seen people posting the initials but never knew what it was until recently.  I discovered that I am ENFP but doing further investigating.  I am HSP ENFP 3w4 379 sw/so which put a spotlight on why I feel the way I do.  It opened my eyes to a whole new world.  Yet at the same time it make me question life, existence and everything.   I did feel reborn but still misunderstood what was going on in my head now.   


I was looking for more answers but the doctors couldn't explain it.   I then came across all of this info and it really helped me fill in a lot of the blanks in my head and my heart...

It did answer what I had been looking for in myself and I was doing great.  The problem was I still felt alone.  I think a lot of it has to do with the world we live in and reflecting on everything, disconnecting from all of the toxic people around me.  Like my father, sister and that side of the family since its seems to be the norm for them out of ignorance.  


Anyway.  Today was really hard getting out of bed but I did.  I am engaged to an amazing woman and we plan on going to where I work to get married.  I work for the government county organization and one of the IT engineers.  I got a house for both of us in January 2019 after I sold my house.  At the time she was renting a apartment since she just moved back home from Montana when we first met in Jun of 2018.  We have no kids but we have 4 dogs and 3 cats.  She makes me laugh and we have  the same goofy personality.    


She still loves me and has always been by my side after all of this.  She still loves me and it does break her heart seeing me this way.  She also hates to see how I have been treated my doctors recently and how much emotional pain I am in.  Its just been a struggle because I feel where I am at in my life is not what I was suppose to do.  I have been at this job for 12 years and its been tough lately but the pension I feel is worth it.  


I also felt the need to mention that me and my fiancé have a great relationship.  This past year we maybe had sex 3 or 4 times.  So that had don't a number on me.  Its not like she is going behind my back.  She is an office manager at vets office which is very stressful for her as well. Given seeing animals in pain or getting put down on the regular.  However we have gotten closer and she want to be there for me.  She had leukemia and was a St Jude kid but she is better now.  She ended up have an iron deficiently from it so she does get tired a lot which makes sense.  However we still do stuff together.  She is very independent so a lot of the time we might be on opposite sides of the house. However we have been trying to stay in the same rooms just so we are around each other more lately.   


The last time we had sex was a couple weeks ago.  She was into it but it was more for my well being I felt.  I have always been the type of person to take care of the other person and focus on them before me.  So I think that is what she was doing and helping me feel normal.  Its just that it feels like I have to initiate everything.  So in that time of what can only be called a ""dry spell,""  it did a number on my confidence.

However I feel out of place.  Like I should of been a music producer/engineer, high performance car engineer, working at the ACLU, therapist or motivational speaker.  I ask myself questions like is just a mid-life crisis, do I have a serotonin deficiency or what?  


I really don't identify as any race or creed.  I was raised in a catholic home and when to a private school up until high school  So I feel I was sheltered because of that. I feel we all just exist ""just because"" if you will….  


However I have also gravitated towards people of color.  It started when I was child and my aunt who would babysit me.  The neighbors were black and Anthony was my first real best friend that I remember but after I started going to grade school, we just grew  apart.  I think this is also why I finally felt home when I joined the USAF.  I come from a town called Streator, IL where drugs and racism seems to just be part of life.   It why I left.  


There are kids I grew up with and family members my age who each passed away due to drug overdoses.  


Looking back I was a stress-eater but still try to stay active.  I also think I was a shopaholic or maybe its just the ENFP in me going from different things I was passionate about?  


People have always said I am very smart and a deep thinker.  It just trying to balance my emotions.  It reminds me of the saying that there is a fine line between genius and madness.  


[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-hidden-habits-genius/202009/is-there-thin-line-between-genius-and-insanity](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-hidden-habits-genius/202009/is-there-thin-line-between-genius-and-insanity)  


The past couple of weeks I just found out my mom had a mini-stroke in November but she didn't tell me until xmas day.  So that really fucked me up and started this snowball.  Then I found out this past weekend that my dad was diagnosed with COIVD back on Dec 17 so that just added to grief I had with being last to find out.  I was told it was to protect me since I was going though a lot but all it did was open up old emotional wounds for being last to know yet again.  

I hope this doesn't come off like the ramblings of a mad man either.  I just wanted to share, get this off my chest and hopefully connect with someone here who might have had similar experiences?  


I feel I have so much I still want/need to do for myself but also for everyone else in society who may of been objectified, abused or what have you. I just really feel lost..."
821,Suicide,I want to really badly
822,It's getting harder and harder to wake up,"I haven't found joy in much lately. I haven't had many good days and its getting harder and harder to wake up. I don't know what to do anymore, working out doesn't help and neither do my friends. I feel like I'm not enough for anyone and I hate being alone."
823,My Existential Paradox,"Ohh wow what a title am I right, definitely gonna get a lot of upvotes with that woooooooooo... ANYWAYS

For years now I've been suffering from all kinds of physical health issues that are for the most part caused by anxiety and depression, some part of it being my eating habits. Those issues would be pretty manageable if it wasn't for the fact that I HAVE MAJOR HEALTH ANXIETY THAT STARTED A FEW YEARS BACK AFTER PASSING OUT WHEN COMING OUT OF A SAUNA...

So all of those physical health issues are multiplied times 10 by me fearing for my health, being anxious that then causes more physical symptoms.

All of that for years has created a pretty good cocktail for me to feel suicidal and like ending things is the only good option. You know how it is, it gets immensely tiring when all you see is darkness for a while.

Where does that put us, to a place where you think of death in many ways every second you're awake. But it's not as simple as feeling suicidal, no no, you also fear death, but you also want to die, but you don't want to die you just want things to get better, but if things get better you'll only be more anxious because suddenly you've got things to lose. 

TLDR: LIFE MAKES ME WANNA DIE BUT ALSO MAKES ME FEAR DYING!!!!???????

All of this is really incoherent I apologize, might as well end with the question, HOW ARE THERE ACTUAL PEOPLE WITH GOOD MENTAL HEALTH????"
824,I Featured in My First Ever Magazine!,"3 months ago, I gave up hope. 
I was battling a severe eating disorder, depression and having just dropped out of university, I felt utterly helpless. 
I decided to turn my life around, and started a blog documenting my experiences and helping others get mental health support.
Now, it’s 2021, and I was featured in the January edition of IAMBEYOUTIFUL magazine talking about my recovery, mental health and body positivity! 
Success is out there, and there is a plot twist somewhere in your journey! Don’t give up! [I FEATURED IN A MAGAZINE ](http://atypicalaj.com/i-featured-in-a-magazine-iambeyoutiful/)"
825,Should I go to a mental hospital?,"I'm pretty sure I'm sick enough to the point where I need to go to one, but I'm stuck in a shitty situation with school right now. I have a crap ton of assignments that I never finished or even started this semester, and I only have a week and a half left to finish them. Finals also start next week. If I were to go to a mental hospital right now, I wouldn't be able to finish the assignments and I'd miss finals. Should I just wait 2 weeks and go after the semester is over?"
826,My dads mental health is in bits and I don’t know what to do,"I never post on Reddit or YouTube or anything but I just really need some advice, from anyone. Since we’re in tier 4 there is very little I can do to take my mind off what’s going on at home. My dad is in a relationship with my step mum and they only got back together around a year ago after she cheated on him back in 2018, they have a kid together and I think that’s why they got back together in the first place as it is clearly evident there is a part of both of them that hate each other’s guts and my dad told me he did when they split up. Anyway, they’ve always argued when they’ve been together but the past few months it’s bin really bad and it’s got to the point where I can’t just not do anything. They are both very prone to stress and they almost only argue when my dad does something that my step mum doesn’t agree with as she is extremely controlling and because she can argue better than him and is more aggressive she always wins and always lets him know exactly why she thinks he’s wrong and expresses clearly why she thinks my dad is so useless. My dads gotten to the point where he’ll barely make conversation with anyone in the house which I think is because he is just so defeated and because he’s in fear that she’ll just rip his head off over anything. She is manipulative and I can’t stand her guts and I’d tell my dad in a heartbeat to leave her if it wasn’t for the fact that they are both expecting a baby in 4 months. So I feel like if I say anything to my dad about leaving her he won’t take anything of what I say in because he’s almost too far in at this point and there’s obviously a part of him that loves her and he wants it to work. I also want to talk to her about it but I don’t know how to give constructive criticism on their marriage whilst also saying she is the problem without their being a massive argument. I honestly don’t know what to do but I feel like I have to do something because I don’t want to carry on living this way and I also don’t want my dads confidence to fall through the floor as much as it is already. Any advice would be great, thank you."
827,am i bipolar?,"(20M) so lately within the last year i want to say, i’ve been having these crazy episodes i like to call them. there’s times where i can go days to weeks feeling a certain mood then out of nowhere i can be in a completely opposite mood for the next few days to weeks. the moods range from sad, to angry, to excited, to happy. why does this happen? the sad and the angry times can be really toxic and i feel like i need to separate myself from everyone.

i never had this experience before. i use to be happy 100% of the time i feel like. or i mean maybe i just always held the negative feelings back? idk i’ve always tried to not let my feelings get the best of me in the past. lately they’re just uncontrollable. 

is this just how everyone is? is there something wrong with my head? lol 

i also use to be heavy on a variety of different drugs for awhile from about 15-19. idk if this could’ve blinded me in the past and once i sobered up i started to retrieve such emotions back. 

i’d love to hear your input. thank you all."
828,Is it bad that I daydream for hours?,"Ever since I was basically three, four, or five, my sister and I would play pretend. At first, it was with things like Mickey Mouse and whatnot. No props or anything, just each other and our imagination. You know, like kids do all the time. 

However, we never grew out of that phase. I’m sixteen (turning seventeen this year) and my sister and I still go upstairs where no one can judge us or listen in, and play pretend with whatever interests our hobbies now. It’s never sexual or anything, just a different world. Kind of like a “head cannon” for whatever tv show, movie, book, etc we are both interested in. We speak as other characters, never ourselves. 

We are extremely close siblings, and we’ve always had a strong attachment to each other (still nothing sexual). This is something that we do in our free time. 

Also, I think it’s worth noting that this behavior didn’t spike again due to covid. We’ve always done this, it didn’t really stop ever. I feel like daydreaming together has made us a lot closer, and I don’t want to stop. It’s fun, too! It’s like expanding on a story, but we can change events or continue them.

The main part that worries me a bit is that we do this for hours.

For context, yesterday was Sunday so we didn’t have school. We daydreamed together for what I would estimate to be at least ten hours altogether (with breaks for meals and whatnot). On school days, we do so for about three to five.

We only really stop for meals, or if we’re at a family gathering. Even then, we’re the only ones really close to our own age so we can sometimes find a less crowded area and just whisper. 
 I can’t speak for my sister, but it’s not that I hate the reality I’m in right now. Though it really stinks sometimes (as all reality tends to do) it’s not terrible. 

Another note I want to point out is that the daydreams aren’t perfect utopias. They have their own conflicts. And I want to clarify that we don’t use too many original original characters. The other ones are characters from preexisting universes. But if we want to expand a characters relationship or not have them single, then we create a character just to satisfy that need. 

I felt that this was more appropriate here than on r/askdocs so any help or clarification is appreciated. I’m willing to give more information in the comments, so feel free to ask questions and let me know if this is more appropriate on r/askdocs or not."
829,"high anxiety, intrusive thoughts","does anyone have any advice on dealing with intrusive thoughts? i’ve been practicing the “i’m noticing that i’m having the thought that.....” for a while, but sometimes that’s not enough to ground me at all. my anxiety is really high and i can’t shake the intrusive thoughts no matter what i try. any tips on subduing them?"
830,What's going on?,"Lately it feels like ive been living in a haze. I sometimes think to myself ""The F\*cks going on"" just standing still, feeling unfocused and disconnected from everyone and anything. In short: I don't feel present. Living in my own head."
831,Does school feel impossible to others too?,"I don't know what it is but this year has been awful for me, i have no motivation and am failing all of my classes and at this point ""school"" has become a trigger word for me to get sad. Is anyone else having this much trouble with everything?"
832,Just a depressive episode or did my antidepressant stop working?,"Hey all,

I've been on cymbalta 30mg for the last 2 years and it's worked great. However over the last week-week and a half I've noticed my symptoms starting to rear their ugly head again, although not in any intensity like before.

Could I just be going through depressive episode and ride it out or is this something I should be consulting my doctor sooner than later?

I'm going to wait another 2 weeks to see if things change before definitely asking my doctor."
833,"Why do ""motivational"" videos make me feel worse?","Someone who was trying to help me get out of a depressive funk gave me a link to a playlist of their favorite motivational/get pumped/get hyped videos, and I spent a week watching videos from the list daily when I felt particularly low.

The messages seemed overwhelmingly positive, not even ""tough love,"" more ""You can do it, and if you fail, it's not the end of the world, because you can keep trying,"" but I began to dread watching them. When I finished, I didn't feel pumped up or hyped; I felt worse about myself. 

Why is my response to these positive messages a chemical dose of, ""Well, you're a real piece of shit, huh?"" Why would that happen?

834,Feeling so lonely during lockdown,"All my life I’ve been the most independent person, looking after myself, being happy alone. However since COVID hit and I spent from March - July completely alone, I now severely struggle with loneliness and anxiety.

Does anyone have any tips to help combat loneliness? I speak to my family and friends everyday."
835,(Don't Know What To Put Here),"On my previous post, I did talk a little bit about my dream and lack of conviction to my education.

In my dream, I was hugging some one close to me. There was shoot-out. I like the sound of shells, the reloading, the smell in the air. I wasn't afraid, only mildly concerned for the person that I'm hugging that they'll die. Later on, I was taking care of them and checking for wounds gingerly before attacking two other people. I remember one of them vividly. He was wearing a white shirt, rather skinny, nearly bald. I remember which wrist I slashed, which neck I stabbed. I remember how he makes a slash on one of my hands, but that didn't matter. I felt it, but I overlooked the pain.

I remember how later on I chopped out the two bodies, thrilled at the thought that nobody will ever find it again. If they do, they won't know. I mixed sodium hydroxide with some other things I remember vaguely from instructions on how to dispose deer carcasses. I relish the thought of finally their souls leaving their body forever after trying to harm me. I tried not to leave anything behind. I cleaned the blood. There's really terrible smells, but that's easy to deal with. In the end, there's nothing by a slimy pile of ""mush"" I could dispose from the consequence of the lye. I remember throwing away the shells, wiping the house clean of DNA, and reassuring the others as much as myself that it will be okay. They don't have to look at what's left of those assholes.

It feels... good. I want to do it again. I want to pick up a knife again."
836,Why tf does violence and aggression feel good to me?,I know this is weird but I get the same feeling from hitting people as I do from like petting a puppy. I always enjoyed fighting like for sport etc as a kid but when I got older(like 10) it felt different. At this point I'm more likely to jump at the opportunity to fight than I would for sex. Any ideas?
837,TW: So I think I need a therapist (long story),"I've been considering getting one after a while and I think I just had a make or brake moment for me.

A solid 30 minutes ago I was in emotional distress and keep in mind I've been self harm (lil bit with a razor blade yunoo nothing to sever), feeling empty, nothing matter, existence has no meaning, type episodes and I felt as if Ive been faking my emotional distress in the past, even though I'm clearly not, (typically this happens when I'm feeling good not bad). Usual emotions lying to me situation. 

And we'll, felt as if I zooned out a bit and started executing commands I was telling myself. I wanted to prove to myself that I'm not as good as I sometimes feel to be. 

I ended up putting a blade onto my wrist and cut pretty hard and long, idk if I was dissosoiating or not but I barley felt pain and thought I wasn't cutting hard enough. Eventually I gave up and was like ""stop doing this it's not healthy""

As I get up and see the bleeding I noticed it was really, really bad... And started panicking realizing my parents may see this cut since it's so close to my hand, a quickly walked and prepared to clean up the wound and started laughing because it felt sooo fucking good to express what I felt in a self destructive manner, which then was cuppled with dissosoiating heavily all while I bled, an snapping back to realized I fucked up, then coupled with sadness realizing my parents are gonna be concerned for me and scare for my life, and that I'm nothing but a fucked up waste of there efforts, and panic then back to laughter and so on. I alternates between these states every few minutes

Now I'm sitting here typing with a make shift gauze on my arm... Concerned that this may be the day they confront me if it's seen- but what can I do

My mental clarity has returned I feel like my normal self... I think I need a therapist. Just to clarify I do have a history of depression and suicidal tendencies... And an impulsivity to use drugs (don't care what). Currently live in mostly a healthy environment. I wanna get a therapist not only for the help, but to see if I have a pretty bad condition or if I'm just a moody teen year old per usual....(age 17) I've been doing agresssive research and align closley with bpd like symptoms but, that can't be determined unless, I get a therapist... So yeah

Long story short, had a mental break down, think I need a therapist"

Nearly every single AA person that comes in, has this diagnosis of schizophrenia or if no diagnosis, they appear to have it, and therefore get the diagnosis after a while. I'm just curious if there is something deeper? Is this a bunch of misdiagnoses? Is it a common mental illness among certain ethnic groups? Maybe a more provacative question: Does past trauma alter DNA and cause this for these future generations?
I'm definitely aware that AA people do not always receive the proper help due to biases in medicine.

840,I want to kick out my mentally ill sister? Help..,"My (22f) younger sister (21f) has a list of mental illnesses (schizo affective, manic depression, bpd, etc.,). She's been through a lot of trauma &amp; drugs, and was missing for 8 months. Finally, in June she moved in with me and my S.O. Ever since it's been nothing but hell.

She doesn't have a job, doesnt want one, so i spend hundreds on her in just a month with money i dont have. She rarely cleans, when she does she cries and gets an attitude and does a poor job. Her room is a wreck, she barely showers, doesn't take care of our things (breaking/ruining), and eats all day ($1,000 month). She constantly lies over the smallest things (ex. Saying she walked the dog, when she didn't.) She doesn't qualify for SSI or UI. I've Baker Acted her 4 times already.

Anytime I say no or call her out on things it turns into this huge screaming battle, even if I calmly explain it. Oh, also she apparently has had autism for the last 15 years and i apparently was never told? So she will start slapping herself or repeating the same thing over and over during arguments.

Everyday is a problem &amp; I don't know how to discipline her. Just today she told me she's quitting therapy. I can't take it anymore, she's ruining my life. My SO is threatening to move out bc he hates her so much. Im broke, tired, and struggling mentally myself. She doesn't have anywhere else to go. 

I want to kick her out and be done but I'm worried she'll go back to the streets and drugs. 

WHAT DO I DO?

But I have dealt with emotional and physical abuse with my mother and, I'm afraid how I cope is not healthy. I shut down completely and start crying until someone speaks up for me.

844,I don’t know how to become motivated and it affects my life too negatively,"I find myself in positions where I become really excited and happy about a new endeavor, only to become sad and unmotivated about it shortly down the line. This seems to mainly affect things I don’t enjoy too much, like my job. 

I got really excited and happy when I just got it but because I don’t really like customer service (it actually drains me A LOT to be honest) I just get so depressed and down about the fact that I don’t have a choice but to stay at this job because I need the money. I have panic attacks and cry almost everyday before I go and sometimes it’s so extreme that I can’t even show up. Showing up seems like something that normal people can do even if they don’t like their job, any advice on how I can do that too would be greatly appreciated, because I NEED THIS JOB. 

I’m not qualified to get anything beyond customer service right now. I do have goals that I think about but there’s something about my mind that just forgets all the things I want to accomplish when I’m having a mental breakdown about my job or just.. anything in life really, idk why but my goals are just not enough to motivate me when I’m overthinking and crying and having a panic attack. At that point my plans/goals just start to feel like additional stresses. 

My thoughts and feelings keep interfering with the goals that I have and I’m just trying to make it not affect my life so much in a negative way. I made an appointment with a counselor/therapist but they’re not available until Saturday, can anyone give me advice on how to make it through the week? Thank you. 

Thank you for reading, I hope you have a nice day.

847,Feeling like a fraud,"This all started when I got my premenstrual dysphoric disorder diagnosis. Besides the normal symptoms of PMDD I also noticed really bad concentration issues and sometimes experienced this 'zoomy"" Feeling. Some people in my support group mentioned it could be ADHD, as it was also a common co-morbid condition and that their ADHD symptoms worsened during this time of the month. I began to notice other symptoms that lined up with these symptoms. However, while I've complained about these issues in the past like I said they only really worsened around my cycle. I've heard people might be experiencing more ""extreme"" symptoms for a lack of a better word due to quarantine? But I can't recall having these issues in my childhood except for maybe over daydreaming and overly strong attachments to certain things (or losing stuff). I never did poorly in school because I already had all these accommodations because of my physical disability. I feel like my anxiety over not knowing or feeling like ""Oh no this can't be me"" is causing the issues I'm talking about. I want to talk to my psychiatrist about it but I just feel fraudulent. It's making my brain hurt so fucking much honestly. And I don't want to ""beat the test"" although my friend said that's very hard to do. God I hate this."

849,Should I seek help?,"Hi guys, 
I've veen struggling with self-loathing and self-harm thoughts for about a week or two now. I feel like it's too short for it to be something to be worried about, but it's really been bothering me. I can't bring myself to be motivated for my studies but maybe that's just laziness. 
I've had a few periods before where I felt numb for a few days, and I generally have a tendency to be hard on myself. 
A few days ago I've started hitting myself. When I'm working with a knife or walk by a street I get casual thoughts of killing myself. 
The last few days were agonizing, at times I felt too heavy to move and either felt like I was burning inside or numb.
I feel like maybe it'll just be ok again in a few days, but maybe not? 
Maybe I'm just making it bigger in my head..."

852,Is Neurodermatitis caused by stress some form of a symptom of having anxiety?,"I'm really confused.

I think a lot, but I might as well confuse it for worrying.

If something unreasonable is asked or something else that stresses me, I begin to scratch my skin (the part that has Neurodermatitis). Recently it was my mom asking if I can come with her to show how the train ticket machine works. (In the end this means I need to sacrifice 6+ hours in the specific day) 

I was worried about getting infected to corona, but also because I hate interruptions in my routine. Of course, I also like to help my mom because she helps me a lot, then again I'm feeling really conflicted. 

Let's call moderate stress a trigger. Is this a kind of anxiety? Or is it not? Of course, I plan to visit a doctor soon, but I feel stupid saying I have Neurodermatitis caused by stress, you know?"

TL;DR at the bottom. 




For Context: My name is JCB and I'm 15 years old (please judge me fairly despite my age. I understand us teens are grouped in with angst-ridden, attention seeking mental health fakers but I promise you I do not fall into that category) . I have been in a long distance relationship with a girl I hold extremely dearly to me for about 6 months now. This girl has Dissociative Identity Disorder. This may come up later. This relationship had been smooth sailing and was even the happiest I had ever been for a time, however now this same relationship has caused me to take the biggest mental dip I've ever had and I can't take it anymore. 






Why has this dip happened?: My girlfriend, who will go unnamed, has this habit of ""disappearing"" at random points in time with no explanation until she returns. She does this in the middle of conversations and even in the middle of calls. Sometimes she'll disappear for days at a time and, her not being the most mentally stable, it leaves me very worried for her and what she could be doing. Not only that but I rely on her a lot for my own sake and happiness and so when she's gone it takes a toll on me too. The explanation for the extended disappearances have gotten... Less reasonable to me as time has gone on. Not only have the explanations gotten worse, but the times have extended. 



Disappearance 1, 2 days: She went into hiding in her own head. Understandable. Wish she could've told me but if she did her alters would've known and that would've defeated the point in hiding. 




Disappearance 2, 2+ days: She became socially drained. Also understandable, maybe could've told me but I've felt like that too. 




Disappearance 3, 3 days: Took a break from her phone. An understandable reason to disappear but she absolutely could've told me. Pretty upsetting.




Disappearance 4, 4 days: Was spending time with family and friends. Yeah this one frustrates and upsets me the most. I was effectively being ignored.  






Disappearance 4 occured just a week ago now and she's been infrequently contacting me ever since. One day I asked if she wanted to play Xbox together one day, and she said yes. It would've been the first time we called probably that much, so I was excited. I waited for hours for her to tell me she's ready, only to look onto Xbox and see she was playing with others. I lashed out a small bit with a pretty snarky remark and then she decided to talk to me about it. 




The reason she had been ignoring me was because apparently she doesn't want to face the responsibility of a relationship. I have no fucking idea what that means and am only the more upset about it. She claims I'm a good boyfriend and she claims that she still loves me and yet doesn't want to speak to me most of the time, ignores me and flat out replaces me with others. It's all Extremely distressing and heart wrenching for me. 






So, I'm trying to organise a break between us. Let us leave each other alone (moreso, me leave her alone) and figure out where we are and want to be in this relationship. She isn't really co-operating though, as ever.








That's all well and good and all but this is r/mentalhealth not r/relationshipadvice. Where does mental health come into this?: Well basically, this whole thing has caused my mental health to plummet. I feel like absolute dogshit almost all the time, but I don't really know what's wrong with me. 





Let me explain: for the time me and her have been in this relationship I have clung onto her like a parasite. She is my absolute heart and soul and I love her with everything I have, but I don't think it's normal. I feel like I love her *too* much. I feel like I'm too attached to her. Is this normal? Does anyone else ever attach to their partners like this? Is there any way to fix it? 





Anyway, apart from that, I also feel like I've lost myself. I feel like a husk of who I once was. I've lost a severe amount of my identity and things such as my sexual and gender identity, things I'd previously thought easy to answer, I've begun questioning. I also don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't know where there is for me, who wants me or who I'm supposed to be. 




On top of that I'm almost never happy. I have hobbies and things I supposedly enjoy doing but nothing captivates me. Nothing satisfies me to a degree that makes me happy. I collect action figures and even though recently I've bought ones that are extremely good, I haven't derived any real joy from them. Additionally, because of this mopey demeanor that manifests itself I have been pushing away my friends, as I have neither the energy to talk to them nor the desire to reveal this downright depressing side of myself. Is this normal? Is there a label for this? For any of this? Has anyone else felt like this? 






On top of all *that* I also feel anxious and nervous about totally random things that I previously wouldn't have felt anything for. Things like wearing my mask for too long causes a panic attack or worrying about things I've said hurting people even when I had no intention to do so. And this is a very frequent thing I feel with many different aspects of my day to day life. Is this correlated with everything else? Is this just normal? 




And recently these things have culminated into the worst kinds of thoughts. I feel like no one wants me, that I don't belong anywhere, that I'm only making a negative impact on the people around and that everyone would be better off without me. 







So yeah, TL;DR: 



Due to some recent events with my girlfriend I have developed a poor mental state consisting of: 


An overwhelming feeling of emptiness and overall sadness that pushes away my once close friends 



A lack of identity and ability to tell who I really am, who I'm supposed to be and where I belong 



An anxiety for minor things in day to day life that can take normal things and turn them into a scary, paranoia ridden scenarios that lead to panic attacks 



And even some bad thoughts about myself and reasons to live. 





Can anyone help identify what may be wrong with me and how I can fix it? I don't want to feel like this anymore. I want friends, I want to talk to them I want to like them. I don't know how much longer I can take this state of mind. I desperately want to resolve it. 




Feel free to ask questions if you need anymore context. Thank you."
857,"""Just be positive""","Whenever I am down, which is pretty much always right now, people say to be positive. That having negative thoughts and a negative outlook on life is what's keeping you down. 

But I wonder this, if that's the case, why didn't my positive thinking stop my life from going downhill in the first place? Back when I was happy, and I did have a positive outlook on life, that didn't prevent bad things from fucking up my life, so how is positive thinking suppose to rebuild it?"
858,Help. My mental health is going downwards quickly.,"Hello. I recently turned 14, and I really need help. I have not talked to anyone about this (sorry if this is a bit all over the place).
I have had eating problems since I was around 11-12,where I would go in periods of time without eating (started with skipping lunch at school, recently been skipping breakfast and school lunch, so I would first get food around 2-4 pm). I'm getting better at it, but my brain is telling me to go back to skipping meals. I also used to only cry maybe 10 times a year, to now I have been crying (when alone) 3 days in a row (including now). My view on my body has gotten way worse, and I'm starting to wanna ""reset"" to get one I'm more satisfied with. For reference, I'm 5'2,and a little wide around my hips and waist, while also having some muscle.

To my social life, I only have 1 good friend, while she has many. She could go days without me, where I can't go 1 day. She's the bestest friend ever and I don't know what I'll do without her, but my thoughts have begun to say ""she doesn't care about you"" ""she doesn't need you"" ""she has other friends that are more important"" etc. I don't know what to do. I have not told anyone but my cat, which I don't know what I would do if she was gone, and this subreddit. Please help"
859,I am an extremely fake person but I want to be true to people,"I noticed this a while ago but whenever I talk to different people I always put on a persona without realizing it. With one of my friend groups I'm loudish and make people laugh, with another I talk with a casual inside voice and meme around, with my family or at work I'm monotone and show no emotions, when I'm at one of my extracurriculars I'm goofy and quiet, infornt of classmates I'm quiet yet speak firmly. This is the first time if talked about it with someone yet I can tell others have noticed, and if you ask me which one is my real personality I would say none of them are, to be honest I really haven't felt emotions since a couple of years ago. Which was the sadness I felt before I overcame my depression and suicidal thoughts. Now I kind of just go through every day without chasing happiness or avoiding sadness. Im on medication for anxiety but the anxiety I feel is not a fear of talking to people  but a fear of getting in trouble with my parents. The me I am when I am alone is someone who spends time reading and thinking mostly I don't really like walks but I go on them so I can think without distractions. And the last peace of information I can really give is that though I'm not suicidal anymore I don't really care if I die tommorow, if it happens then it happens. The only asperation I have for my life is to live in a way I can be content with.

Redditors, am I creating personas because I am afraid of what people may think? Am I creating personas due to a lack of identity? These are two theory's I had but I want to hear your thoughts. Thanks"

Today I'm genuinely happy.,"📍I run a YouTube channel about mental health and self care. 📍 Recently I did a video called ""Mental health for teenagers by teenagers. ""📍I'm happy to announce it hit 400 views. 📍I think my video raises awareness about mental health &amp; I certainly think it can help you too 😊 ❤

861,Break from college,"Will it ever be alright for me to stop college and focus on mental health?

I just think that I cannot find myself going through college all through out without assessing my mental health first..."
862,Lockdown treatment,"So now we’ve gone back into another UK lockdown, is it still possible to get admitted to a psychiatric hospital?"
863,found this helpful podcast for anxiety,"Its called Panic Attacking, two comedians talk and joke what recently made them anxious , discuss listener submitted anxiety and have a discussion with a professional therapist at the end of every episode.  I listen to it at work and it actually calms me down.  Here is link:  [https://open.spotify.com/show/6trZdCda1lC6f0U5B6m1dH?si=0kvcqcFGQSi0fdXoEzf2Qg](https://open.spotify.com/show/6trZdCda1lC6f0U5B6m1dH?si=0kvcqcFGQSi0fdXoEzf2Qg)"
864,"I'm toxic, I need advice please.","So, I made some shitty decisions. My ex who broke up with me a few months ago is still getting my relentless toxic traits because I never moved on. I still looked at her to fulfill some of my needs.. but this is far from the worth thing I""be done.. if anything that was just Co-dependancy that I'm also working on lots.


But recently I remembered I had her Instagram account on my phone, most of the relationship I had this and never snooped through it, it was to give me access so I could post to her cats instagram account we started together. Anyways, after breaking up I started to read the messages she was getting. I told myself to stop and that I was lucky to not have found anything big or memorable.. but recently I did it again. But for a different reason, she was talking to a new guy and I enjoyed that control.. 


Although, I wanted to tell her and just letgo because I didn't deserve it anymore.. I couldn't? My anexity kicked in and tried to make it seem like she was the toxic one and I tried to get upset at her so I didn't have to tell her so I could just run away.. but that was never gonna work. I wanted to be with her. I tried to talk to her about my feelings during a situation and I was getting upset during it, then tried to drag out another conversation to fix that problem.. I just realized that it was because I was feeling guilty I was getting upset.


and it's seriously not ok to do anything like I did. I don't know how to fix this at all. I told her about it, set up boundries admitted I fucked up, deleted the account from my phone and now am just waiting to see what happens. I've excluded myself from that entire friend group too because I have 0 rights to see my ex's face/talk/be in the same house as her. It kinda really sucks.. I just feel like crap because I knew what I was doing and I just didn't stop. Fuck me.. I've done this before to her once, and told myself never again. And I've done it in a online ""friendship"" in the past. I'm so toxic lol. Please help."
865,I'm stuck.,"Nothing feels like it's worth it anymore. I'm honestly just sick of myself. I'm so disappointed with what I've gotten myself into. I'm 19m, a high school drop out, I work for my father, and live with my parents still. I do not have a proper license nor does my family have a working vehicle. I can't seem to get my head out of my ass and get my priorities straight. I'm thankful that I will always have a backup job but this job sucks the life out of me. I have little to no motivation to perform well at my job because of this, and my father pays me accordingly, so I don't really make a lot of money. Then it just cycles from there. I am so depressed, not to mention very lonely. I'm gay and from a small town. It SUCKS. Not because people are bigoted though, everyone is too fucked up on drugs to care about a gay person. Anyway the dating pool here is very nonexistent. I really don't want to try a dating app because I absolutely hate the insufferable and cringy person I turn into. I am immature for my age and have a couple of mental disorders (autism, ADHD, and Bipolar Disorder) and I'm really insecure about that. I want to date an older guy but I don't think anyone older or the same age as me would want to deal with me and my situation. I have talked to my friends and family about all of this but there's nothing they can do because it's all on me. It's just so overwhelming because not even 6 months ago I pulled myself out of that suicidal hellhole I was in. I am very very overwhelmed and I wish I can just be normal. I really hope noone judges me for saying all of this but I can't control what people think. Sorry"
866,"New to this sub. I need to know what should I go with, a therapist or a psychologist?","I need some help. I know I suffer from what seems like anxiety and depression though I've never been diagnosed formally. My jobs has this mandatory overtime that's been in effect almost a year now. They are making us work 45 plus hours a week. I think 40 is totally manageable but that extra hour a day I used to use for things that made me happy. I would make art, i would crochet, but now I don't have time for any of those things. I'm miserable. Basically what I'm looking for is for a professional who could write me a note telling my job they couldn't work me more than 40 hours a week for health reasons like pregnant women. I know it might sound like I'm not grateful to have a job, but realistically it's been really tough on me and on my relationship because I'm not as happy as I normally am. It's painful to even talk about honestly though I know that's the only way I'll get anything done. So I'm here basically for advice, let me know what I should do. Thank you for your time."
867,"Really embarrassed, I missed too many therapy sessions","I am so f\*cking ashamed of myself. My therapist is setting me up to have a phone session this week with another doctor but I am afraid she is transferring me to a different therapist because she is fed up with me not answering the phone. I am so bad at answering the phone. I slept through the alarms and phone calls. 

Been dealing with severe mental illness since 2017. I've had anxiety most of my life but now am dealing with several  overlapping mental disorders that have rendered me disabled. I can't drive because of severe anxiety and suicidal ideation from depression so I have to get rides from my family, walk, bike, etc. I feel guilty because I have such bad trauma and social anxiety that I can't even deal with using a taxi cause I'm afraid the driver will verbally harass me. So I think I want to learn how to drive at some point but t will have to be one on one private sessions since going into a classroom is impossible for me with or without the pandemic as a factor - the anxiety and trauma are too much for me. 

But yeah it has been really hard to get out of bed at a decent hour and I can't sleep at night because I'm either having panic attacks from emetophobia that I've had since about my late teens, or because I am numb from depression and just don't feel tired in my body. So I've missed countless phone calls because I slept through them.

I am having issues with the neighbours as well. They are extremely belligerent bullies and lash out at every sound I make because the walls are thin so my life has been drastically effected. I walk on eggshells and never take my headphones off. I don't listen to music anymore because they will start banging or tell me to STFU. And I can't complain about it because I am in a really weird living situation. Basically, because I am severely mentally ill my grandma allowed me to inherit her condo, so I live here now and it's very nice. I helped dad renovate it and I am grateful beyond words. But now that I'm having problems with bad neighbours my dad doesn't believe me because he thinks I have psychosis and I don't. I have documented evidence of the harassment recorded on my phone. I recorded it because I was fed up with being told by my dad that I was imagining it or delusional. 

I feel awful for being like this. There's people who deal with bad neighbours no problem but I feel crushed by the stress of every moment of my life being judged by a white trash couple. 

I know I sound crazy, this is f\*cking crazy stuff. I don't know where to go to talk about this stuff cause my therapist is fed up with me being negligent. I feel horrible and want to be dead. I feel I deserve this. 

I've self harmed n the past week and think about dying all the time. I miss being able to listen to music. I don't like loud noises myself because CPTSD or PTSD make me really jumpy and sensitive to stimuli. I listen with headphones on and at reasonable volume. Talking about this makes me hate myself, complaining about neighbours is such a sh\*tty thing, I want to wash my mouth out. But they've made life unbearable and I don't know how to escape this. I'm obliterated by my mental illness, living on disability and know that moving won't help because I will encounter bad neighbours at some point and I need to grow up, stop being a Karen and deal with it."
868,Finally left a bad job,"I gave my two weeks notice last week at work. It’s been making me so depressed and anxious, and it’s such a toxic environment. I have some interviews lined up and enough savings for a couple months. But I just had to share because this load came off my shoulders. I feel light and better than I have in years. I’m just so excited I wanted to tell someone. My therapist even said, “you seem more calm today” on my virtual appointment this morning. LOL you bet, Im feeling great. I hope everyone has a great day! 

(I work in healthcare, I’m aware we’re in a pandemic and it’s a bad time to be unemployed but I’m not worried about finding a job, just may not be exactly what I want. My problem with my job existed long before the pandemic)"
869,Im probably gonna kill myself soon... I just want someone to know,"Idk what to say... Im not even scared anymore, whatever happens happens."
870,My world has gotten so small and my mental health is worse for it.,"I've basically been shut in and alone for a long time now.  I'm sure I'm not alone in that aspect given the global circumstances and a lot of people can perhaps relate.  I have a therapist apt but I can't be seen until early Feb apparently.   I've noticed though that as my world has gotten so small, little things bother me FAR more than they should.  My ego is weaker.  I feel extreme angst as well as extreme anger more readily.  Things have been bad for a while now, but it seems to be getting worse.  It seems apparent that because there is so little currently going on in my life that my mind is making much bigger deals out of smaller things than it otherwise would and my emotions are harder to control.   
I was wondering if anyone had any advice about how to broaden a person's world during this lockdown?   I go for walks every day but lately it's a struggle to not dwell one or two negative things I intellectually know aren't big deals but emotionally feel big while I'm walking.  Does anyone know of any ways to  get involved in like weekly Zoom groups or I mean anything really?  Anything positive that involves people?  I honestly don't know where or how to start."
871,"By the way, L.I.T.erally, every one should stay away from this mess.",
872,How Things Are For Me,"The world seems to lurch inward, crowding my thoughts. The stress and anxiety grip and strangle the flashes of happiness that I get to experience. My family is in the frontline, people are dropping like flies, and I feel alone... I have some really great friends and an amazing spouse but it has become so hard to open my mouth to speak. Instead, I cry silently in the shower hoping that someone will come in and find me while at the same time hoping that nobody does so I don't put my problems on their shoulders. We are all struggling; I can see it in their eyes but we can't talk. It takes too much to talk. Instead, we seem to all sit silently hoping for a better tomorrow but feeling like the world has buried us too deeply to get out. 

I at first thought I was the only one feeling this way but unfortunately, so many people feel the same. Know that you are not alone and hopefully soon enough, we will be able to hold the ones we love."
873,My dad tried to kill myself today,"
While I was in therapy today around noon I was getting a bunch of snapchats from my cousin and when I finally opened them after my session was over (which was about family issues and relationships and such) the messages were about my dad who was trying to kill himself today. Its not even 1:30 in the afternoon where I am right now. The police are at his house which is at my grandparents farm next door to their house. Pretty much everyone who was previously living on the property (my grandparents and cousin) have been evacuated from the property as in like police escort anytime they leave or go to the property because my dad has lost his mind. He’s actually been scaring everybody. They told me Hes just been consistently getting worse and doing weird stuff like sitting in the house without lights on, having full conversations with animals, running in the middle of the road when they try to leave the property. Today they were supposed to get him evicted because he’s caused so much trouble for everybody like threatening everybody (family and neighbors) and beings extremely chaotic and just not making sense with anything he does. He also hasn’t payed any bills and he thinks everyone is crazy except him. His psychiatrist doesn’t see him anymore because he’s been on a consistent downwards slope since the beginning of 2020 and began using drugs and again and continues to drink even on his psychotropic meds. I overheard a conversation with my grandparents who said that his dr said and I quote “he smelt like beer and crack” 

From my knowledge He’s been diagnosed with things like Schizophrenia, ADHD, OCD, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, Aspergers, AND narcissism. 

At the beginning of 2020, which I know was awful for everyone and I feel guilty for pitying myself but it was definitely the worse year of my life... not even because of the pandemic but just from everything that came out of it. Just... bad luck I guess. 

I stopped visiting him as often because Im in college and I had lots of friends and went out a lot. We lived at an old farm house in the country so we have lots of guns casually but this one day he held me at gun point and told me to shut up and sit down and was shooting buck shot ( which spray like 20 pellets) at the ground in front of my feet so I would jump up and get scared Ig it was a control thing. And continued to tell mr that my sisters depression was my fault because I neglect her and all this other stuff which I actually did feel like was my fault until later I realized that the way he was acting wasn’t really my fault but I still continue to feel guilty for not being more nurturing and cool I guess. 

I remember he started seeing one of my ex best friends mom (a friend who fucked me over and told my deepest secrets to people at our school because I kicked her out of my house for being a shitty friend and not going to class or getting a job) who was an ex prostitute and just a literal trash bag of a human just like her kid; apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. And so I tried to break them up or whatever but He’s the type of person who will do the opposite of what you want. I remember I came to the farm to spend a day there with some friends to hang in nature and it had about a month or so since the last time I had seen him and he had lost about 20-30 lbs. I literally thought he had cancer. I cried on him when we went inside the house because I thought he was gonna tell me he was terminally ill and he said he had just had a virus and hadn’t been eating for two weeks. I told myself its cool its fine and my friend said I was just tripping which I KNEW something was fucking horribly wrong but I wanted to just be cool...

so a couple of mental breakdowns later (I could have handled it better because I went ape and trashed the house before she even moved in) I gave up and just stayed away from the farm and disregarded it.


So he was in debt to my grandparents a couple thousand dollars and he was also surrounded by trailer park trash and I kinda put two and two together that he was abusing hard drugs and I needed to just stay away from him. I tried telling the women in my family before that we needed to do something ( presently, a year later they understand whats actually going on now) and I tried so hard to talk to his therapists and his psychiatrist never did answer the phone because of covid. I eventually gave up all efforts to help him. I feel guilty because I sent him a lot of very regrettable text messages full of hatred towards him. Maybe he likes the attention because its better than NO attention. But I feel like he ruined my life. I know that its not his fault how I feel and that the way I reacted to everything was awful. I completely freaked out and for about a month straight I had thoughts about raiding him and his new wife’s house and hurting both of them. Not stuff I would actually but just thoughts fueled my rage and feelings of inadequacy. I only ever came back once to get some of my old stuff and I punched her in the face and we got into a good scrap and I won and then kinda skedaddled out of there while they called the cops with my close friend who I’m in a healthy relationship with now, thankfully. ( forgot to mention they got married and he eventually went totally broke because all her kids and her kids baby moved in and my little sister who is 14 had to move out because she had nowhere to sleep anymore so she stayed with my grandparents next door) i could have really used all the money he blew on his new family for college, or to help pay off my car which he originally bought and stopped paying for.... 

Pretty much me and my sisters mental health had been steadily declining all year. And now our relationship with out mother is terrible. I mean literally 20 minutes after new years 2021 my mom and I (both wine drunk of a bottle each) got into a huge argument and she wants nothing to do with us now. I wouldn’t usually start screaming at someone like that but I was defending myself and my little sister. Because she always holds her and my dads divorce over our heads because we were gonna live with her and then we moved back with out dad to stay at the same school and she was left alone and without child support at the apartment she got for us. Im selfish for that. I know I am and I regret that decision but I was a confused teenager and I missed my friends and the farm and I also worried that my dad would be suicidal if my sister and I left him alone in that old house. I really dont know how to make her understand that stuff. She also fought for us a lot in court and is thousands of dollars in debt now because of attorneys and such. So shes reminded of it everyday of her life. There was just... a lot. I didn’t leave because I hated my mom ( although it would have helped if my mom wasn’t constantly projecting her emotions onto us) its hard to be around her in general but I still love her so much and I wanted a better relationship with her especially now that there is no chance of a better one with my father who is extremely mentally ill. He’s being taken into an institution as I type this. My cousin sis still texting me about the situation. Now that I’m a little more mature I feel like I can sit down and talk about stuff with her and not throw a fit like I would have back then but its too late mow because she spent time trying to fight for my sister and I to come live with her and we cant even have a conversation without her completely fucking blowing up and screaming. I dont know how to move on without support for either of my parents. 

On top of all that other shit my old friends think that I’m a sociopath because of my reaction to drama that came up in out friend group. Girl a was talking negatively about girl b and never mentioned to her that there was a problem and everyone joined in the conversation including me... i partially agreed with stuff they said but once I was alone and I thought about it.. i just. Cried. And changed my mind about how I felt about it because I knew they weren’t gonna ever talk about it unless I said something I just didn’t care about consequences anymore and made an impulsive decision to tell girl b what girl a said. my friends were fighting and I was stuck in a roommates situation with some of them. My relationship with Girl a had been kinda shady and I knew she had a problem with me because she would talk about stuff that I fid that bothered her to other friends and we both kinda never talked about it because I didn’t think I had to because I was pretty sure that I had only really had a problem with her having a problem with me??? Really weird complicated one sided shit and I just wanted to keep the peace but there was still tension no matter what. I guess I became kinda delusional and assumed that they were doing the same thing with me that they were doing with girl b and just talking about all the shit she does wrong without ever actually asking her if theres something wrong or if she needs help. Maybe I wad just feeling sorry for myself I told girl b I saw myself in her position and that why I told her everything. I had a very emotional reaction. I broke promises. I lied. I just didn’t care anymore. Even to the friends that I didn’t even really beef with. I just Cut every one off blocked everybody and told myself I need time. I dont know why I did all that stuff. Just self destruction i guess. I told myself before that It wasn’t okay to be living with people who are mentally ill but that I would be okay as long as I minded my business, but I wasn’t. and I moved out like yesterday. Im in a new crib with my partner. But I destroyed pretty much all of my personal relationships before Christmas even hit and everything just kept getting worse even after new years because I guess thats what I fucking get. and I would like to blame it all on stuff from my childhood but its still totally my responsibility because no one else made me act like that. I dont know if they’re toxic or if I’m toxic. probably both because a common theme with most of my friendships is that we all have family trauma. But I just.. reacted the most. And I hurt pretty much everybody. I kind of hate myself. And i know they hate me too. Ive never been like this is my life.  But Ive changed a lot over the past year. I love change, i consider myself to be an optimist nihilist. Life has no meaning, so I can give it my own and thats beautiful to me. I am someone to embraces change and I want to live a virtuous life. But this time I changed for the worse and Ive fallen into a hole I just cant really get out of. I haven’t even really talked to my partner about most of the stuff I mentioned here and we live together now. They are really happy to be starting something new but I’ve never been so depressed in my entire life. I try to put a smile on my face but its gotten harder than ever before. Im afraid of hurting them too. I dont talk about it because I know it will bring them down. I had a problem talking about my feelings with my old roommates because I was paranoid that if I gave them valuable information about me they would use it against me to try and psychoanalyze me and contain my entire identity into something they can diagnose me with which is what they did when we had the whole situation with girl and and girl b. As a self defense mechanism I just kept smoking weed and being a happy-go-lucky piece of shit and never let anyone know that I’m in pain. Because I always feel like either no one actually cares what I have to say or is low key happy to hear that I’m suffering. I just have bad trust issues and anxiety I guess. i feel like I’m just an awful selfish person and I worry that Im a fucking narc like my dad and its in my genes that ill just never be an adequate human being. I wish I could make amends with all the people I hurt but Im just not strong enough at this point I’m so beaten down and traumatized. I just need time to even think and process this shit. Its gotten harder to keep it in and I want to cry every day now. Its bad. 

If theres anyone that relates to any of this or at least tell me if I’m crazy or not I would like to hear any and all constructive criticism. Thx"
874,Privacy,"
Hello! How are folks keeping their therapy sessions private during this pandemic especially during this incoming winter and living with multiple roommates and thin walls. I’m in Brooklyn if anyone has advice/suggestions/solutions. Also i already use a white noise machine."
875,Cleaning...,"Something that I want more than anything for myself is to be able to keep my house clean. I care a lot about the decor and design of my living space, but the fact that it's pretty doesn't mean shit if the decor is always covered by, well, shit.
Every time I'm able to motivate myself to clean, it feels hopeless, because I know the house will just end up trashed again in a week's time. For information's sake, I'm diagnosed with depression, but I am un-medicated. If there is a way any of you other depressed folks have found to get motivated to maintain your living space a little bit every day, I'd appreciate hearing about it."
876,"Overwhelmed, ill, and so lonely. And taking care of spouse with schizophrenia","I have serious health issues myself and last year I exhausted my options for treatment and diagnosis, ending with some answers but not nearly enough treatment.  My little family is 100% alone because of the virus.  My spouse is so sick all of the time that I do everything but hold down a job (thankfully he is able to do that from home).  So I take care of the house, yard, 3 children under the age of 6, 3 pets (and we’re adding one soon, hopefully to be a support animal for my husband but it’s going to be rough), and all of my own and my husband’s medical needs.  He can barely take care of himself at all, I need to remind him to take his medications multiple times per day and monitor his other health issues. 

I’m so sick and lonely and overwhelmed and I don’t know who to talk to or what to do next."
877,"I have no one, and people I meet always bully me, everyone","I don't know why I even struggle. I am living in homeless accommodation (My previous attempt at flat-sharing resulted in being bullied, just like before), the people beside me now torment me as well, my family have made me a nervous wreck, the people I work with treat me like a clown, I have a limp and a bad back, and I struggle understanding anyone due to not really having a grasp of communication like other people do. I feel like I am under fire from everyone in my life, and anyone new who comes in does the same thing. I am not young. I had the worst Christmas yet, worse than the previous 2 I spent alone (I was technically alone this Christmas, but I went home for 2 days on the 23rd and 24th which was a disaster). I really should just kill myself, but it is not an easy thing to do, I also don't want to. I feel so alone, as I just don't speak anyone else's language. Psychiatrists have said there is nothing wrong with me, but look at my life. What the fuck is this hell."
878,I’m slowly fallling deeper into the dark,"I don’t know what to do. Everyday I get worse and worse. I have no one, and nothing. Just the other day, I accidentally nicked my finger on a knife, and almost ended up slashing my wrists out. I see a rope, and immediately think about whether or not I could hang myself with it. Everyone I try and talk to, doesn’t help. My parents called me “attention seeking” and that “I have everything”. I get told I’m just a kid. That I have no reason to feel how I do. What do I do??

I’m slowly losing it.."
879,I'm broken,"Becoming depressed again. So quickly this time. I want to be fixed or die. I hate this helplessness, worse everytime it comes back, and it always will. 
I was made wrong. My body is heavy. My mind is slow. Can't do anything for the pain that isn't really there. I feel like harming myself, but it won't make anything better either. I really don't feel like talking to anyone I know, they wouldn't know what to do. In this mood I don't really care about them either.
Everything gets buried here too, so it won't make any difference. Nothing will."
880,How do you deal with being the emotional support while suffering yourself?,"Basically what the title says. I've always had to play the emotional supportive role for my mentally and physically ill parents and other people. I say I had to because if I didn't, shit would go down. I dont wanna go into detail. It's still like this now. I just would like to know how other people in my shoes deal with this? How do you cope? I'm having a tough time, or more like life, and I could use some healthy tips. All my coping mechanisms are not so healthy. Thanks."
881,How do I help my untreated schizophrenic mom?,"My mom has been diagnosed with schizophrenia for the past few years but refuses treatment. At first it wasn’t as bad, still bad but not like it is now. She was convinced that something was alive in her technology and trying to talk to her, then she thought the government was following her. Since then things have completely devolved. She is constantly talking to herself (and she barely speaks to anyone else, when she starts conversations she just spaces out halfway through a sentence) and has such odd behavior (ie sniffing my hair while laying with me, walking around in just her underwear and heels, etc) at this point I’m worried if there’s even anything left of who I knew her to be. She refuses to get help because she insists nothing is wrong with her and that no doctor is smart enough to tell her anything even if she is sick. She also feels incredibly insulted every time someone tries to imply she has schizophrenia, and she’ll shut down and go into her head not talking to anyone. Every time we’ve had her instated in the hospital she shuts down and does whatever the doctors want until they let her leave and then when she’s out she feels betrayed by everyone who tried to help her and shuts down even more. Her diagnosis is also exacerbated because she’s on ceboxin and takes adderall to counteract the drowsiness that comes with it (though I’m not sure if her doctor knows that). I’m just so lost, I miss my mom so badly and at this point I’ve had to basically have a funeral for her in my head because the woman who inhabits my mothers home and body is not the woman I know or grew up with. I don’t know what to do or how to help her, but she seems so sad and lost and she’s completely alone through it all because she’s shut down to the rest of the family. She just cries herself to sleep at night and I hear her crying all the time when she thinks no one can hear her. I just want things to get better before she maybe ends up leaving me and my younger sisters permanently, but I just have no idea what to do"
882,I want to kill myself.,I hope I get hit by a bus.
883,I am making up my physical pain,"This may be long...I am a female 44 years old and always felt mentally stable. Until now. 
I had a stroke at 38 and was diagnosed with two rare brian disorders. In the beginning I fought tooth and nail to recieve the medical attention that I needed. I was feeling better until 2018 then my body felt it was  falling apart. 
I started feeling a lot of pain in my body, strange sensation all throughout my body, severe fatigue, and a ton of unexplained symptoms. I have been chasing a diagnoses for 2 years. I was finally diagnosed with Lyme about 5 months ago. I was treated with antibiotics. I feel a slight improvement with the pain. But nothing else. 
I just started seeing a physicarist and I was diagnosed with PSTD, depression and anxiety. Prescribe Zofolt. I realized it takes a bit to work...I am trying my hardest to work through it...but I am drowning. Emotionally, physically and mentally. 
I have always been the type of person to be able to deal with any problem that arises. Now I feel like a little girl, broken into pieces. My anxiety is super high,  my depression is worse, I feel numb in my body, and in my brain. I can't organize my thoughts. I can't process things or conversations. I get very overwhelmed if more then one person is talking to me. I cant find joy in anything or anybody. I moved recently into my mothers house, due to my health and that didn't workout, I am now saying at my Aunts house and I am not happy there. I know it isn't them...it is me. I just want to climb under a rock and hide. Or die. 
I am thinking of checking myself in to a mental health facility. I do have insurance. Can anyone share thier experience being in a mental facilities. I went to the health department back in August. Feeling exactly how I feel now, begging for help. I did not want to live anymore. I was in so much physical pain it started to affect my mental health. Tjey talked me off the ledge and decided to push through until I could get a appointment with the physicarist.  It took months to talk to physicarist. I am suprised that I have made it through this long. As I mentioned...I was just prescribe Zoloft 2 weeks ago, I do not see any changes yet, but, I do not believe medication is going to help me..especially feeling as  low as I feel. 
I am started to think that I maybe imaging some of my symptoms. Maybe my mentail illness is creating physical pain.   And if that is true...how do you fix that?  Is there a medication for that. Any input or advice would be helpful. 
Thank you for reading and sending hugs your way. I do not know how people make it through times lile this. ❤❤"
884,My boyfriend ignores me because of his depression and I just can’t understand it.,"I really don’t get why my depressed boyfriend ignores me. Need perspective. I get having a bad day and not wanting to talk to anyone but it’s when he randomly ignores messages that hurts.

Example - I just asked him on Snapchat how his day was and he ignored it (hasn’t opened it) but still sent me a meme on Facebook so he knows I messaged him. People keep telling me this is just his depression and not to take it personally but I do. I feel like he hates me and just doesn’t want to talk to me, or he’s doing it on purpose to annoy me. I just don’t understand even as someone with depression myself (yes I’m aware it effects people differently)."
885,Waiting for the other shoe to drop,"I have had a great year! I overcame PPD and my baby overcame his cows milk allergy, which turned him in to the most amazing, happy, good spirited, perfect little creature to have ever roamed this earth. I have a lovely stable relationship with a very supportive man. He got a new job last year with great perspectives and I got a big promotion. Also we have paid of most of our debts, the ones we still have left are no problem to pay them of.

So, life kinda is perfect.

Buttt, I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. My life has been miserable for sooooooooo many years, and I have endured too much trauma for 1 human to bear. Now that everything is so good, I am so scared that I will once again lose everything, that I'm too scared to enjoy it fully.

I'm afraid that if I let myself become to happy or comfortable I will lose it. But I know that IF I lose it, I will hate myself for not enjoying what I had, when I had it, properly. 

This constant internal struggle is just really freaking draining. 

Can anyone relate, or am I just weird as f*ck?"
886,I need help but don’t know how to ask my parents,"for the past 2 years maybe my mental health has deteriorated tremendously and the way I think/see myself and the world has grown toxic and has caused me to lash out at those that I love. My parents are emotionally unsupportive, my dad generally doesn’t believe in mental health and my mom thinks that I shouldn’t be depressed/anxious/etc because “nothing is going on in my life”. It’s stupid, she’s always invalidated me and my feelings and compares it to worse situations. I think I’ve been needing therapy for a long time but I don’t know how to approach them about it. Im scared of being called dramatic or idk. Any advice on how to do so?"
887,i don’t know how to get through another lockdown,"my mental health deteriorated so much during the first lockdown i was in a toxic relationship and my anxiety got so much worse it’s coronavirus. now a second one has been announced and i’ve only just started to get my mental health back on track, i’m out of the toxic relationship and have a wonderful supportive boyfriend who i can’t see through lockdown he’s been a major part of getting back on track and i rely on him a lot, i don’t know how i’m going to do it without him. i’m just so worried about how i can get through this and it’s brought it all back up and i’m going to go down again"
888,anyone relate to this?,"when i look back on memories in my snapchat just from a mere month or so ago, i feel like i don't even know who that person is? like the person looking at the image isn't the same one within the image. does anyone relate to this?"
889,It’s lockdown again...,"So here in the uk we’ve been put back into lockdown. I work in the health service so obviously will still be going to work, but I also know what lockdown means for me at work and it’s filling me with dread. 
Pretty much as soon as we got the news I was taken over by a wave of anxiety. I tried calling the one person who I know would have helped me feel OK and they didn’t answer, which left me feeling pretty broken. 

I don’t know what to do anymore."
890,I feel alone..,I haven’t had a job for about a month now.. I’ve been looking everyday and can’t get any calls back. I’ve been in a rut for a while now and just can’t find my purpose. Even when I’m around others I still feel alone and just trapped inside my head. Always second guessing myself and never really have emotion. Of course when I get invited somewhere I put on this fake personality like everything is okay. It’s draining me and it’s hard. I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing with my life. I feel like I’ve let my parents down and myself.. After my panic attack in November I got help and was put on medication. After a while I stopped taking it and tried therapy as well.. I feel crazy for taking medication and every time I explain myself to someone I don’t think they understand. I’m scared because I don’t know what my future holds or even if it holds anything. I’m just a lonely kid with problems that I don’t think anyone can help. I look around and see everyone doing grand things and going to college and here I am doing nothing. No job. No purpose. No college. No girlfriend. All I do is just think and I think about the past non stop. I’m thinking about everything and just day dreaming all the time. I don’t know if this is making sense or I’m just a fucking crazy dumb kid. Maybe it’s me.. idk. Help.
891,Nothing feels fun anymore. How do I combat this?,"I've struggled with depression since my teenage years. I live in England and with the current covid restrictions the things I normally get my enjoyment from are no longer available. Does anyone have any tips for keeping my mental health in check? I've been drinking a lot lately and have thought about smoking again which I've left behind for a year, I know this isn't helpful. Any suggestions would be massively helpful"
892,I think someone I was talking to killed themself,"Yesterday I messaged a reddit user who I think may have committed suicide last night. I convinced them to call the national mental health helpline but for some reason the call didn't connect even after they tried several times. Afterward I gave them other numbers and talked to them, but I dont think it helped. I didn't know this person directly but I stumbled upon their post and felt a connection seeing that they had gone through similar experiences and had similar interests. I dont know how old they were or their name but they were in highschool. I'm really sad. I know they had gone through terrible things and the pain was unbearable. Of course, I don't know exactly what they were feeling but I knew what they told me, and tried to listen and offer my best help. 
But I'm really angry at the world. I've known so many people including myself, who have struggled because of inadequate mental health services. This person was scared that if they got committed it would cost their parents too much. They also were on medication that didn't work. They had had bad experiences with therapists and their parent didn't understand their situation even though they had been in danger for a long time. My heart hurts so badly because I think there could have been a chance this person would still be here if they had had better help and treatment for their depression. I don't mean for this to sound like I'm dismissing their pain, but they were thinking and saying things I've thought and said, that are classic markers for depression. I know it's not the same, but I think this person's environment let them down. 
Today I looked back on the forum I found this person's post on and I saw other people who are suicidal and planning on ending things soon. I wish there was something I could do. I'm honestly struggling a lot in life right now, and my mental health isn't that great, but I wish I could convince someone to hold on and seek help. Depression is treatable. I'm so grateful that I'm still here after going through severe depression in highschool.
I don't want this to sound like I was blind to this person's pain. I honestly feel a little numb right now and am trying to process everything slowly and not blame myself. I'm worried for this person's family and two best friends. And I hope they are maybe still here and safe in a hospital."
893,Should I go back to therapy?,I want to go back but it seems like a waste of time to me. I’ve been on antidepressants for like 3 years now and been at therapy for 2 years. I was getting better but recently I’ve been down worse then ever. I hate myself so much and I can’t really feel connected to anyone on a emotional level. Not even my close friends. I’m so sick and tired of the monotony of everyday life and I’m just really really tired of trying. My mental health is going down but if I go back to therapy I feel like I’ll just be on it for another year and not gain much of anything
894,From self-esteem and jealousy,"Some people just make me really furious. Mainly the kind of people that are super confident and have a strong personality. The ones that seem to have it all together and seem to be better beings. The ones that know everything or live a lifestyle that helps the environment, that represents intellect, 'coolness' or stylishness. The ones that seem to have it all. 

Being around these people raises a feeling deep inside me that brings out a really hateful side of me without any reasons. No one is harming or attacking me in any way. Yet, my mind wants to find ways to hurt their feelings and degrade their 'superior' position. Make me look better, smarter, more social.

Of course, i don't act on these feelings. I try to act normal, have a conservation and be friendly.  But it is exhausting to drown these feeling that simmer deep down in my stomach and make me sick. 
However, drowning these feelings makes me passive-agressive and stupid, resulting in me feeling lower than before.

A circle formed. Starting deep down in my fragile self-confidence, passing jealousy- town and making me more alone, more stupid, less self-confident.

I was never a hateful person. 
I don't want to be a hateful person. 
I don't want to degrade others to make me feel better.

But how can I change?
 How can I avoid this deep down feeling creating this hateful version of me?
Do I need therapy?
Should I isolate from auch people to avoid the feeling rising to the surface ?

Just, how can I become a person that wishes well to everyone genuinely, from all my heart??!




*** Thanks for reading. Have an awsome day! ***"
895,Is this normal?,Recently I've caught on that I question alot about myself often and it causes me alot of anxiety and stress. I remember from a very young age I was obsessed with the idea I had IBS (weird and quite funny tbh). I went to the doctor's multiple times about this. Throughout my life I've become stressed and obsessed with worrying about specific things that are wrong with me. For instance my recent one has been that I'm losing my mind (worrying to type that). I sometimes forget about this but I bring myself back into the cycle by thinking delusional things on purpose? For instance my big one is that I feel suffocated sometimes that I'll fall in to the sky. I try to laugh it off but the worry and obsessing over it stays. This is a everyday occurance for me and some of the stuff I become fixated on scares me abit. I know I'm just worrying but it does cause alot of stress and I've had lapses of depression over the years more frequently and intensely. I remember a year ago my big obsession was I felt like I wasn't real but I don't feel like that at all anymore so I know these things aren't real or any real concern just I can't stop worrying!! Anyone have any idea how I go about this like is this normal? I've been to my GP on numerous occasions and nothings came of it. In fact I think going to my GP and even writing this in a way isn't helping my condition but worsens it so I'm just looking for reassurance or if I actually need it some advice :)
896,I really need to vent and get feedback,I just want someone to listen to my fucked up stories about how pathetic and hard my life is
897,I’m so scared,"I’m a 20 year old uni student who has suffered with anxiety for many years. 

Before covid NOTHING phased me. I would spend hours socialising etc. 

Now I have 0 motivation to do anything. I’m scared to leave the house and when I do, it’s for feminine products, junk and alcohol. 

I have exams coming up and I can hear this little voice in my head telling me I’ll fail. I tried to study two questions but barely did one. I want covid to disappear because I feel as if I’m not learning anything in my course.. oh and I ironically do psychology. I want things to go back to the way they were because I had so much planned. 

I took care of a friend over the summer and I burned out right before the semester began, but fought through. I walked away from late nights etc, but I’ve noticed that my own mental health has taken a dive. My grades have slipped, all I wanna do is sleep or binge on food. 

I apologise if this doesn’t make sense, my thoughts don’t even make sense rn"
898,"Aside from light therapy, regular therapy, vitamin d pills, and medication, anyone have any recommendations for dealing with seasonal affective disorder?",I’ve found ignoring the fact it’s winter and putting up summer decor to be at least somewhat helpful. Any other ideas? I just get so depressed this time of year.
899,Do you ever get the feeling of having to do something important in this world?,"I often feel so useless. I am a student right now (studies aren't going too well which is a massive downgrade right now for me). 
I get the feeling of HAVING to do something important or heroic in this world. Writing a book, studying something other (like medicine)...- I just want to be seen as someone who did/does something really cool and important. I want people to look at me and my work. I don't want it to be ""mainstream"" but unique and important. 
I have no idea where I get this from but it's crushing me inside. This is such a strong feeling which is having a huge negative impact on my current studies and motivation of doing something ""unimportant""/""not cool"". 
I am so sorry I know this must sound awful and I have to be happy with what I have... but I can't help but feel useless and unrecognized. :("
900,Possibly Bipolar? Possibly need hospitalisation,"So I could write a long thing about how my life has gone this year, but in this moment I need to say... I feel like god... I feel like I'm observing the world and I'm not a part of it! Like I know, kind of... that this isn't normal. But it feels like I'm receiving information from a higher power. There is no way my brain can compute so many things at once. Also I'm through the roof hyper as in....I can't explain. I could run 5 miles right now! Easy! And I'm not slim. But the thing is...this morning I was suicidal...I woke up and burst into tears. Sat on the edge of my bed thinking how I would do it if I did. 

I'm grieving my mum, who was the closest person to me easily. My girlfriend and I have split. Yet...I feel fucking great! I feel like nothing can stop me! I survived this, I can survive anything. But I wish this feeling would stay! Yes it's annoying being so uncontrollably hyper but I feel amazing. Like I've spent the last month barely getting out of bed... now I feel unstoppable. But I'm scared of this feeling going! Because it's like the complete opposite of depression and I need it.

I know, I KNOW I need to call a doctor. My mum was my ""carer"" technically, although I was abroad when she died so I didn't rely on her for everything. She used to book my appointments and things because I was always too anxious to. I've never called a doctor, weird init? I need to stop I can feel myself lowering I need to stop writing"
901,Angry for no reason,"Now a couple of times I got an overwhelming feeling of anger when I went to bed, my thighs start to burn and hurt and I get a migraine. Then I start to overthink everything and it gets worse, I don't really have an explanation for it and would like to hear some thoughts."
902,Am I crazy or...?,"So I have struggled with ED’s, depression, and anxiety (all of which diagnosed) for YEARS. I feel like I am overly concerned about how other people perceive me, not mentally, but physically. 

I idolize (I know it is toxic) Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian (as well as plenty of other women). 

The reason I am sharing this is out of curiosity- does anyone else have a bizarre obsession/interest in knowing how other people perceive you physically? 

I have some friends that have been friends of mine since I was like 10 (I’m about to turn 23) and I still feel like every time we see each other, they’re going to realize that I’m “fat and ugly” and drop me. 

I know I’m insane, but I was hoping there would be one other person in this sub who kind of understood"
903,Ahh this should be fun: locked in quarantine with my parents indefinitely. Yay /s,"Okay, so England was just put in another lockdown with schools closing indefinitely. Exams are most likely cancelled (which isn’t helping my state at the moment) and I’ll have no one to talk to. I’ll have no way to tell teachers about what’s been going on in my head and my friends, while wholeheartedly supportive and loving- can’t really do much about it aside from kind words and hugs. 

My mom screamed at me when I accidentally told her that I’ve been having issues with my mental health, and threatened to take me to the hospital. Luckily she thought I was just being dramatic, and only mentioned it in passing to my dad, in a joking way. 

I feel like I’m trapped. I’m less suicidal than I was in November and early December (nothing really serious then either) but I feel like I should be able to tell people this. My parents constantly tell me I can tell them anything but then they yell at me for little things I’ve done wrong, so I don’t really want to see their reaction to this bombshell. 

Forgive the ramble, I’m tired and I don’t know what to do."
904,Trauma,"So just to throw it out there and a little bit of a history...TW for everyone, I was sexually abused by a close family member from the time I was 3 to the time I was around 11. Things got especially difficult around the time of puberty because I started questioning my sexual identity, and general identity and ever since then it’s been a real challenge especially in interpersonal relationships with other males. So basically I feel like I can’t have close male (platonic) relationships without it becoming inherently sexual on my end even if I don’t want it to be. It gives me anxiety and just makes me mad because I really just want to be able to be close with other friends without things being weird. It’s seriously impacted my life and I have tried to explore my sexual identity but on the same coin I feel like I should work through my trauma before I try to put labels on anything. Any thoughts? I’ve been seeing a therapist for awhile now but it’s been rough."
905,Depressive slump over,"Well I'm happy to inform that I'm currently totally fine again. Nothing has changed in the few days since I last wrote about being mere moments from aggressively hurling myself off of something, but over the last 3 days I've completely emotionally stabilized. Its almost bizarre, it feels like thousands of pounds of pressure has just lifted from my body and suddenly all of the problems that was piling off seem way more manageable, yet literally nothing besides from how clean my apartment is (cleaned it myself this morning) has changed. On one hand I'm grateful that I no longer feel tired every time I have to breathe in, on the other hand it makes me a little worried that it really is just THAT out of my control. Let's hope things stay good going forwards. Even if it's unlikely I am able to feel optimism at the moment and I intend to abuse that privilege for as long as I can."
906,"why am i like this, and how do fix it? (sleep/insomnia)","ive never been able to nap, could take 30-60mins to get to sleep, always thinking about something too (probably something i did 3 years ago or my ocd worrying about something), tossing and turning, keep waking up, nightmares.  i know these are traits of insomnia but its weird since ive had them for years and insomnia seems to be a shortterm thint according to the internet.  sometimes im even scared to sleep, wtf is going on?"
907,I did something terrible when I was a child and I don't think I can ever forgive myself. I think there was something seriously wrong with me.,"(21F) I don't think i can ever forgive myself. So first of all, when i was 9 years old, a 24 year old guy asked me to be his girlfriend. I was just a child and i thought it was okay. So that's how i've justified my terrible actions. I blamed them on this guy. 

But i'm starting to remember things that prove i've been a f*cked up child since the beginning. So the terrible thing i did is that: I showed porn to my 5 year old cousin when i was 9. And then he would ask me to show him even more porn. This continued for years. I would watch porn with him until i was like 13 and he was 10. Then i started to understand how bad it is. But still, i didn't EXACTLY know how bad it is. I tried to ignore it when he showed me porn. But this went on for another 2 years when i was 15 and he was 12. I would ignore him most of the times but i couldn't tell him to stop bc i knew it was me who showed it to him for the first time. I kinda didn't want him to get mad at me. I was kinda scared he'd tell his parents.

 Now i feel so guilty. I know it kinda started with that 24 year old guy. He really messed up my mind. But i remember some fantasies i had when i was even younger like 7. I would fantasize about myself getting sexually abused and humiliated. Like i'd fantasize about myself being naked chained to a wall and tied up while some people humiliated me and then they'd pee on me. Or they'd force me to get naked and shower in poop!! Or they'd simply force me to strip and then they'd start touching me or hitting me. 

That's so gross. But i thought of these when i was as young as 7. And no, they're definitely not false memories. I am 100%  sure i had these exact fantasies. I always knew but it's like i've always ignored them and didn't want to accept that a 7 year old kid can have these thoughts. Until now that my cousin is grown up and the sight of him keeps reminding me of what i did to him. I feel so extremely guilty and idk what to do."
908,Am I ok?,"Hi. I need advice.

I think I have something wrong with me, but I have no idea if it's just that I have an odd personality.

I don't think of myself as a human. I don't know why, but it makes me feel weird hearing my name and just generally people talking to me by themselves without me first talking to them. I don't think it would be bad if people hated me for no reason and wanted me to suffer.

I need to set alarms to try and remember to do stuff, like have showers and to do stuff I like, and I'd probably have to do the same for eating if my parents didn't call me to eat.

I think about how great it'd be for everyone else if I wasn't there, and I like having people insult me.

I don't recognise myself. I can't see me as me, all I am is just me right now. I couldn't explain any personality to anyone else if I tried, I just am. I look into my eyes in the mirror and I see nothing. I'll only remember things sometimes and for some reason I seem to think I'm 10 years old. I'll completely change on a day to day basis, I'll be completely normal, I'll be motivated to do absolutely everything and then just not wanting to do anything. I'll read things I wrote on reddit and I always think I'm being the weirdest person ever and that I'd never do anything like that.

I'll want to have friends some days, but forget everything about others the next.

Am I just weird?"
909,"comment a brutally honest truth about how you’re feeling, something that is bothering you.","Right now, comment a brutally honest truth about how you’re feeling, something that is bothering you, or tell me a secret."
910,sharing a 'dream',"2 years ago I had a very odd 'dream'. I woke up in the dark and genuinely saw and believed the world was slightly different. This was both making me happy and panicked as of course I knew it was wrong, but I also didn't want to get out of that delusion.  I'm not sure how I got out of it, but of course when I did and realised nothing changed I freaked out and went to cry in my room.

&amp;#x200B;

I still don't understand how it got so bad this happened, and what followed. But I thought it would be good to share on how badly something can affect your mind, and I hope to never repeat this type of mistakes ever again.

This was from an intense bad 'relationship' (not a real one, but lets call it that for this post). It got to the point he'd every night ask me to his room to 'play games', the rule at that point was 'no sex' but he'd do this weird 'cuddling' to try and make me horny. It was all very weird, particularly as this was all 'suggested' by the girl he was cheating with.  That night he broke this rule.  I recall I was lying in his bed to the side, and he closed the lights and went to sleep.  I had no blanket and was cold. I felt like I was an idiot pet he threw a bone to, so I slightly started crying until I fell asleep there. I think quickly after I woke up and that odd 'dream' started. I was looking at the room in the dark, but none of the furniture he had was there but other items, and I was alone in bed, with blankets on. It felt  like in my head he/her/that whole period of my life never existed.  Of course during this period, I felt good. But yes, then I woke up, and freaked out when I realised it wasn't real...

It's amazing what the mind can do to try to protect itself. I would think that this event shouldn't have had such a bad impact, but oddly from the stress of it all for so many months, and some issues after, it got bad after.  I used to cry daily for months, even during work hours on occasion which was not good, and I hadn't felt calm only until nearly 1.5 years after (really when Covid started and I could relax at home).  It was so odd given I barely ever cried in my life beforehand, but admittedly I did have panic attacks and depression for 5 years some time before.

&amp;#x200B;

Point to take is: You may think you can handle anything and your mind is strong, but events can surprise you and you should never push yourself past your limits."
911,What the hell is wrong with me?,I’m a 15m going on 16 and I really don’t have motivation to do anything besides stay in my bed and listen to YouTube and music and I am not doing my passions and hobbies really at all anymore but I don’t feel sad all the time or even most of the time I usually feel happy or numb or neutral. But I also hate myself and I have cut myself not for attention because it felt right. I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. I’ve had thoughts of suicide but I don’t think I’m going to go through with it. But I don’t think of how much I hate myself and how I want to hurt myself all that much should I get help or what the f@ck should I do?
912,"My boyfriend was sexually abused as a child, what can I do?","I'm 28 gay boy with a boyfriend. We've been together for 5 months now and our relationship has progressed very far and solid. Today he was having a panic attack and He suddenly bursts out he was sexually abused as a child by a still living family member. I was shocked and saddened to hear this, and offered help, he doesn't want to tell his family, and he says he's going to get professional help. He says no one else knows.

I do understand it is his process, and i can't do anything to speed it or force him into theraphy or anything he is not ready for. But this completely changes our relationship, some things start to make sense, like his sudden mood swings or stuff he's told me. And even though I'm in love with him i don't know how to deal with it, except just being there.

Myself being a suicide survivor and been through years of therapy due to anxiety disorder know this is a process that takes years, hell even now that i've been discharged for 2 years I still have to battle myself everyday. A part of me wants to support him, because he feels alone in this journey, and i know how good it feels just having someone you can rely on. But another part just wants to run for the hills for my own mental health, specially since even thought we're commited, it's still early on in the relationship.

I know this is not something to ask in a reddit, but what do you think i can do? It's not like we can pretend nothing happened, but still don't want to force anything on him. Thank you reddit! (also warning english is not my first language and i'm just bursting out words)"
913,Advice when going into lockdown (again),"(Depression and EDs mentioned in this)This is my first time doing this so bare with me; the uk is a mess, or at least it feels like it. Lockdown rules are constantly changing and to be honest its really impacting me mentally. I'm aware so many other people are going through what I'm facing too but I guess I just really need advice and honestly a place to vent. Last year from march up until late June early July I was studying from home due to covid restrictions etc. Before then I was generally quite happy and I'd never been depressed or gone through an episode quite like how I did for the final few months of last years lockdown. When restrictions eased during summer upon reflection I realised how bad my mental health had been. I have really bad emetaphobia and despite being stuck in doors for months it had somehow worsened to the point of myself refusing to eat out of fear of being sick. These habits continued even when I was able to attend school normally from September, my mum noticed something was wrong and took me to a gp where I was informally diagnosed with anxiety and a possible eating disorder. I dont really like talking about it and I haven't been able to get a follow up diagnosis since due to restrictions so I'm not really sure if I do but to be honest it's quite likely. Anyway, over Christmas restrictions were toughened and I began to get an almost nostalgic feeling of depression and anxiety- I wasn't able to see any family members and although it was still a generally nice day it was still pretty difficult knowing how lonely others must've felt, especially those who live on their own. Due to recent announcements from the government I have to spend the next 2 weeks doing schoolwork from home (possibly until March now I haven't checked properly but there are rumours) which starts tomorrow. So now I'm here, the past couple of days have been really hard especially with anxiety- I dont want to slip into the same depression and hopelessness I faced last lockdown- to be honest I dont feel ready at all and I really dont know what to do. I'm sorry this is so long but I really hope some people will be able to relate, if so my heart really goes out to you as I know many are facing way, way harder times than I am. Any advice would be appreciated but thankyou so much for reading this it means so much to me, it's my first time opening up like this so it really means a lot, have a nice day."
914,Friend of mine struggeling with mental health,"

Reddit,

my friend recently dend me a message which was rather panicking. The person who sent me a message is feeling anxious and alone, he is feeling depressed and wanted to let me and my froemd group know. Furthermore, the person was having negative thoughts about live. 

I am not someone who has been in contact with someone who has had mental issues this far, going into depression. 

I was wondering if you fellow redditors have some advice for me to follow.

Ps: my friend has recently contacted a local doctor. 

Kind regards."
915,What do I have? I’m so exhausted,"Hello, I’m really exhausted at this point and I don’t know what I should do. 
I can’t go to a therapist at the moment or talk to anyone, that’s why I am asking for help. ( I know that I can’t get a diagnose from here, but I know that here are people who know a lot....I just need a direction where I can start researching or reaching out to therapists )
I have OCD since I’m 6 and I was always kinda able to cope with it alone. But some time ago I recognised that this was not the only thing that affected me and my personality. 
I have severe trust issues such as I don’t trust anyone fully and I am never able to talk to anyone about myself because I can’t trust them and I think that they will betray me or use everything I say against me or that they are only my friends for their sake ( even though I know them for many years and they have NEVER harmed me in any war or even when they are in my family ) 
I check my phone really often because I’m afraid that people can hear me... 
I’m always looking around in closed rooms if there is anyone/anything in it...( every minute and there is no way that anything can be there )
I see things in the corner of my eye and they are not there in reality or sometimes ( not really often ) I hear voices in my mind and they force me to do stuff. ( I don’t know if that is contacted to my OCD ) 
I forget stuff while reading or I say words incorrect...
I don’t know what to do and I just need to know if anyone know if there is a disorder or anything with the same or similar symptoms.... 
Just for clarification: I don’t have experienced any traumatic events or things such as that 
Thank you in advance...I hope this is the right place to ask"
916,Difficult Breakup in a new city,"I (22F) moved to this new city for him (23M), 8 months ago. He broke up with me yesterday. We had a lot of toxicity. However, I don’t know anyone here. I love it here and have a good job but everything I associate with him. Feel free to give any tips."
917,Moving out of the country or the town?,In the uk since there is a national lockdown being outside is important for my own mental health i might move out of the country.
918,Betrayal at work.,"I work full time with a serious mental health disorder and believe me, it's not easy. I keep my personal problems and diagnosis away from my employer and fellow employees. I sometimes post or comment online. My facebook account is private to keep out prying eyes, which is why its surprisingly hurtful that a fellow employee was wondering why I hadn't added her and the rest of work and found out my Facebook name and told the whole office. I was mortified, upset and a little mad. I felt it none of her business and a major breach of trust. What do you guys think? I mean, now anyone at the office can find me and potentially see what I post."
919,How did you learn to express your emotions vocally?,"[25M, US] Without too much background, I think I have become depressed since losing my mother very quickly to cancer in November 2019. I have never gone to therapy in the past, but I have no aversion or stigma to it.

Before covid lockdowns, I went to see a therapist a few times. I found it helpful, but I never really got passed the whole ""set up"" of talking about what's caused you to seek help. I went to two sessions total. I haven't gone back since March 2020, as I was, and am, an essential worker and didn't want to do over the phone sessions when my insurance doesn't cover much. 

One of the main reasons I haven't returned were the dreaded questions ""how does that make you feel?"" and ""why do you think you feel that way?"" I like to believe I feel a wide range of emotions but I struggle to describe them to people. My go to answers are vague, like having an ""off day,"" or ""eh.""

So I guess my main question is what tools or things can I do to try to learn this new foreign language? I want to go back and try to get help, but I freeze up at those questions. Like today for example wasn't great. I felt sluggish, had little motivation, and was slightly irritable. I don't know why, cause I'm depressed? I am struggling to grasp how I even begin to think about these things. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"
920,"I've sort of been feeling down lately, and I think it's somehow related to some daydreams I've been having lately.","Before we begin, these daydreams are happy daydreams, basically how I wanted my childhood/teen years to go. But more on that later.

# What are these daydreams about?

For starters, I'm in a wheat field with electric poles (like this: [https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/high-voltage-power-lines-above-wheat-field-gm995312606-269412945](https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/high-voltage-power-lines-above-wheat-field-gm995312606-269412945)). These are pretty common in Ohio, so nothing out of the ordinary. Then I have a handheld HAM radio (I have a license IRL) in my messenger bag along with a phone. I'm sometimes walking along a path that apparently most kids in the county take to get places (like certain towns or stuff). Then in some daydreams I'm just hanging out with friends, hiking or biking up a mountain or to a lake, or biking to a place and hanging out with my dream boyfriend (basically what my dream BF would be like) it a forest or something. I think that most kids shows like Arthur (part of my childhood) influenced this. But, most of the stuff I'm doing in these daydreams is sort of like the discontinues CN show ""Clarence"", which I watched until it was cancelled (great show, wish they'd reboot it). Basically going on adventures with friends. 

# How I think these daydreams are affecting me

I think that I'm all melancholy after these things because, well, as stated in the first sentence of this post: **they are how I wanted my childhood to go. It never went that way.**

That's the only thing I can think of. I wanted a childhood like that. But, I went to a small school previously. I wanted to go to a larger public school after I finished the grade at that school (which was my 2019-20 year) but all hope of that was just thrown out the window when a pandemic decided to exist. So, I'm now attending a nice private school (who is handling the pandemic better than public schools), only downside is: my hopes and dreams of finding a friend group like in Clarence were decreased dramatically. And I am in fact friends with all of the kids in my class, only thing is I'm the only boy (combined grades), and I think most people would find it a little perverted to have a boy go out with girls on a hike or kids in a lower grade. So, that's just gone.

For my fellow fans of Clarence or people that have seen some of it, you'll probably know that he goes on adventures with Sumo and Jeff, and sometimes side characters. That's basically all I wanted, to go on adventures with my friends before I outgrew it. But I guess you just can't get everything you want... or most things that are somewhat obtainable for that matter.

And besides, even if I went to school with the kids that live close to me, you still got the pandemic situation going on.

# Closing statement/thoughts.

I wanted my life to be similar to the CN show ""Clarence"" and my daydreams before I grew out of it, but that didn't happen so everytime I have one of those daydreams I feel like a part of my childhood that I never had was ripped out of me.

And for those wondering why I can't just do all of those things with a driver's license since you have practical freedom, I still don't have friends that are boys in my grade (mainly because I'm the one male in my grade).

Also remember how I said ""dream boyfriend"" earlier? No I don't have a boyfriend IRL and it will probably stay that way given I go to a Catholic school, and I'm bisexual. But that's unrelated."
921,I gave myself an anxiety disorder,"I allowed myself to be gaslit into oblivion. My perception of the world was warped by isolation and my cult like upbringing. I knew what was happening but I doubted my perception too much to do anything about it. 

Instead of helping myself I tore myself down. Worthless, I should be scared and I deserve nothing, on repeat. This went on until I went from having no anxiety at all to shaking at the slightest provocation. 

It’s pathetic and I wish I could go back and do everything again with a different mindset, but maybe it’s not too late to fix?"
922,Anyone else feel super super irritable?,I’ve been feeling super super irritable for a while now and it doesn’t go away. It’s becoming bothersome that it affects me at work. I should mention I have depression  and anxiety and been on welbutrin for two weeks now
923,Can I win the war?,"Have been struggling with bi polar depression for about 4 years. Everyday is a battle and some days I feel like I’m winning and others just absolutely kick the shit out of me. The only reason I will not commit suicide is the aftermath that would ensue within my family as well as my closer friends. I am currently trying medications and have been off and on for 2 years. Nothing just ever seems to work or happens to have weird side effects (dick stopped working). What I’m wondering is if there’s ever a day that you finally feel like you’ve won the war? For good? 



Side note: is there anything else you guys could recommend me do to boost/stabilize besides exercise (twice a day), medications, therapy or  meditation, as I do each of those already."
924,Student Counsellor At School Wants To Meet With Parents.,"Hi.

I am a 13 year old male who has been seeing the student counsellor at my school for around a year and 3 months. Before the winter break, they said that they wanted to have a meeting with my dad - who also teaches at the school - about a few things mannerisms they picked up on during our talks. However, I have a massive case of imposter syndrome so often a fuel of my worries will be that the things I am saying are fake and are a subconcious way of stealing attention. They said that they think I have some sort of communication or social issue. I am really strugling with this and am not sure what to do. I don't know what kind of specific issues come under ""social and communication"" and my research has always left me deserted. If anyone could advise me as to hot to act during the session or what kinda issues are encompassed under social and communication that would be greatly appreciated :)."
925,Does anybody else keep social media to feel less lonely?,I keep most if not all my social media but wish I could delete it I only keep it to feel less alone seeing people talking and interacting even when it's not worth it because it's something that is negative just makes me feel less alone anybody else.
926,On and off extreme distress from the way my face looks,"I don’t know exactly what I hope to gain by posting this. I need help. I am too embarrassed to share this with a therapist or anyone in real life because men aren’t supposed to care this much about how they look, and also because it sounds like fishing for compliments. I swear it’s not.

Sometimes I feel handsome. I take pictures for dating sites, picking the ones I think look best, and get complimented for them. During these times I’m actually pretty confident.

But then it’s like the bubble bursts and I realize that when I’m taking candid shots, I am extremely ugly. I’m gay, so I know what is and isn’t attractive in a man. I have a weirdly sloping face, a protruding mouth (which I almost instinctively hide if I’m being photographed), a big nose. A receding hairline for a relatively young person, and bad skin. When I take these candid pictures, I look flat out gross. I have been called handsome in real life. I have also been called ugly, told I look stupid (that’s one thing I’m definitely not - but, when I look at the candid pictures I understand those comments). Been told I had a busted mouth by a disgruntled guy on an app, which confirms what I see. 

In these times, I’m crushed. I only get one life, and I’m going through it presenting a grossly ugly, stupid-looking face to the world. Therapists tell me to reality check other negative thoughts. Well, I’ve reality checked this - I am ugly and the flaws I notice have been confirmed by others. (Aside: I also hate the disingenuousness that my therapist sometimes does with these ‘reality check’ questions, as if anyone is going to be super forthcoming with “mean” criticisms of your appearance. Yes, in fact, I do trust a disgruntled guy on an app to be honest about flaws that I was already insecure about because he has no more incentive to politely ignore them.)

So the thing is I am in this extremely distressed phase. I don’t want to be told I’m not ugly - I know that’s the truth, or at least very close to it, and that’s not something I can change. I just want to know how to not feel so deeply pained by it, to the point of not wanting to go through life or be in front of people looking like this. I want to go back to how I was when I was younger and hardly considered the way my face looked (I was in the closet, never expecting to come out, so my appearance meant next to nothing to me; that’s not the case anymore). I can’t get back to there completely, of course. But I need help dealing with this."
927,Sick of explaining!!!,"I am so sick and tired of explaining such basic things like triggers. Even to people who should absoultely know what they are!!! I've been job hunting after spending 2020 in a haze of medication changes, and I've been hesitant to tell anyone. Well I was talking to a family member and it slipped out and I hoped it would be okay because I know she struggled hard with depression at some point in her life. Shock and awe, it wasn't. I had to explain what a trigger is and why I can't just 'get over' certain things. It had been such a good day too...
Thanks for reading my rant."
928,Pattern of relationship problems,"I have anxiety, depression, an eating disorder, and an abundance of other symptoms that I struggle with. I have had three relationships and every single one of them has the same pattern. 

I meet the person, we have a good time, I can function normally around them. Then, at a certain point, I break and I have to tell them my struggles. At this point, I end up on some sort of “watch list” with the person giving me ultimatums regarding food and mental health. 

This really is challenging for me because I fear for my relationship, and also feel like I can’t be honest with my partner about what I’m going through.

It makes me feel more and more alone and I really just want someone who will be there for me without giving me these ultimatums. I understand that I have to get better, but the pressure is not helpful. 

I also understand that other people are human beings and that they have a right to set boundaries with me. I also understand that I have no right to use my mental illness to abuse other people, intentionally or unintentionally. 

What do I do? I want to respect my partner but at the same time I need a partner who can meet my needs. 

Also, I didn’t even put my boyfriend through hell. I just cried for a few nights and threw up a couple times. I’ve been through way worse and it’s concerning to me that this was apparently too much."
929,TRD have tried 15 meds and none sustained,"so basically i have treatment resistant depression and wanted to know any other treatments that aren't therapy or the basic antidepressants/mood stabilizers/antipsychotics/sedatives cause i've tried a significantly large amount 😅

All the meds i tried actually worked at first, for about 3-7 days, then even afters months i felt absolutely nothing no matter how high we went up :/ my doctor says shes never heard of this before. Also it is not placebo effect thats for sure.

so any other treatment options? that are safe 😰"
930,"I'm a wreck, my depression is overwhelming and is ruining my life","(16m) My sleep pattern is ruined, I've been waking up at 2 pm and going to bed at 6 am, I've lost all my friends and have had nobody to talk to for an entire year, my parents don't like me and wouldn't listen. I feel useless, like I can't do anything well, everything I try always fails. I feel like a burden to everyone.

Englands GCSEs have been cancelled, now I don't even know if I have a chance to do the course I wanted in college. How will my grades go up if my depression is bringing me down. Even when I try I always feel like a failure."
931,Thx guys,I just wanna make a small post to thank everyone that had helped me in the past even tho last time I posted here was like a year ago lol but this subreddit really helped me and am feeling that it will continue to help me later on in life in many things and I hope everyone else that is going through the same things or more or less the same things I was going through eventually feel better just wanna say thx gamers you will not be forgotten
932,Any ideas?,"I need ideas on how to manage my anger 

Yesterday my brother told me to fuck off and stop annoying him and I was sent into a blind rage, by that I mean for like 15 minutes I was in my room, shaking, twitching and crying because I was so angry and I had extreme intrusive thoughts to kill myself and him. Pretty wild lmao

I also need ideas on how to manage sad feelings 

After being that angry I just sort of cried for another 10 minutes and was *this* close to killing myself so- I guarantee that if I had seen ( I covered my eyes so wouldn’t see anything like that ) perfume or anything harmful I would downed it immediately so-"
933,I feel lost and don’t know what questions to ask,I was going through my photos when I saw one of my aunt who decided I wasn’t important enough to come to my graduation. I decided I should let her know I was succeeded in life the conversation was great but I was so angry I started sweating because my mom and my family THERES so much I don’t know and that no one has said all I know is she was a drug addict alcoholic and a stripper and I don’t want her in my life because she lies. My cousin might as well be my mom except she has a job and no criminal record and hasn’t gotten pregnant yet she looks just like her. I have so many questions about who else I’m related to that I haven’t talked to yet uncle’s...cousins who my grandma was and what my mom was like growing up and other stupid shit she’s done... I feel hurt that my aunt distances me from my family because a mistake someone else made.
934,I'm sorry,I'm sorry for annoying u lads.i might leave this Reddit because I feel like I'm just irritating people.
935,I have to listen to music at night so I don’t get too fought you in my thoughts,Recently I have been getting kinda down at night time as I’m not focusing on anything else. So I end up thinking about bad stuff. So to keep myself slightly stimulated I listen to music. Is this okay?
936,It’s all my fault,"When I was around 10 my older sister tried to kill herself, (she’s now 21) I’ve always struggled with mental health because of that but I’ve recently realised that I still annoy her and it may have been partly my fault due to the fact that I annoyed her and didn’t show enough empathy at the time

I’ve always tried to be good in situations like this but I’ve realised I’ve become so numb that i barley feel empathy anymore, I talk to my friends and put all my problems on them, I used to be a bully and used to make fun of less popular kids to gain social respect if you will.

I’m 17 and ive realised I’m the problem, I’m the reason why I’m so low and have been for 2 years. It’s me, I won’t ever kill myself because my family has been through enough and I can’t cause them anymore pain but every fucked up thing that’s happened to me and my friends/family has probably been partly my fault in some way, I’m the problem, and I’m trying to accept it before it fucks me up too much, it’s my fault and I don’t deserve to be happy, that’s why I can’t be, I don’t even know why I’m writing this post, I’m just drunk trying to find reasons to believe in myself but deep down I know I’m the issue and I’m the one that fucks everything up"
937,parents being suffocating,"My parents are the most suffocating and confusing people that I know. One minute they are completely fine, and the next, they are batsh*t crazy and cursing me out. Last night they found out I smoked pot— at first, they said they were cool with it, but the next day they took away all my social media and made me block all of my friends as a punishment. They also talk about me behind my back to my family and siblings, and even text my friends about me— which crosses so many boundaries. They are constantly fighting too, not to mention, and my dad has severe anger issues while my mom is an extreme narcissist. Last night, they told me I could smoke pot whenever I want. Today, they told me I can only do it under their supervision and only do it in EXTREME cases. I mean, I take what I can get, but I still am very confused and am probably going to buy a pen and do it anyways because of that. I suffer from depression, ADHD, and anxiety, and it makes it extremely difficult to cope in a home like this where I feel as though everyone is constantly against me. What should I do?"
938,Does this happen to others or is it just me??,Hey this is gonna sound so stupid but I just watched the movie the book of Henry and anytime I watch something that has something bad happing this was about child abuse I just feel so bad and down and it’s so stupid
939,How to stop overthinking things that HAVENT even happened yet,I overthink about how people around me will turn out in the future and I don’t know how to stop. It hasn’t even happened yet but my intrusive thoughts tell me that the closest people will do something bad in the future.
940,Therapist doesn't know difference between panic attacks and anxiety attacks?,"I've read some things on the difference between panic attacks and anxiety attacks, and I brought them up to my therapist. She says she's pretty educated on anxiety (she usually helps me with my OCD tho), but she was unsure if there was really a difference. She said if I don't have panic attacks then I could just say my anxiety is ""acting up"", but that just feels so weird to me. I've only had one panic attack ever and it used to make me wonder if I really had anxiety cuz I'd hear others with it mention theirs. Reading about the differences helped a lot cuz I have anxiety attacks and my anxiety is still valid. But if the differences between panic attacks and anxiety attacks are legit, why doesn't my therapist know about them? It feels so weird to be seeing so many things saying they are different but to hear a therapist not be sure.

Maybe I shouldn't, but I worry that they're not different and that I have anxiety but not panic attacks which makes no sense. Could anyone offer some insight? (She did say she would read any sources about the differences that I sent her, so maybe that'll fix everything?)"
941,Weird paranoia.,"So a weird thing has been happening recently, my anxiety has skyrocketed in a very weird way. I’ll give context then the last part will be the strange part. 

For context :
I’m an 18 year old male in the UK, I have diagnosed PTSD from being assaulted twice by a group of 10+ people on dirt bikes for something a friend of mine did (they’re no longer part of my life), I was bullied relentlessly in primary and have been through many different therapies, mostly CBT based. I also was in an extremely abusive relationship mentally, physically and sexually from 13-15/16. A lot of this stuff has led to general anxiety, attachment issues etc the usual stuff. 
I’m in a good place now, I have great friends, a great girlfriend of nearly 2 years, I’m finally getting fully into writing music etc. But my mental health decided to turn on me really strangely recently.
I’ve always been super specific about my appearance and have been told by many that I’m a quite good looking guy and am in great shape, but my anxieties due to being cheated on practically like my life was a Saturday morning cartoon with the villain being the next person I was cheated on with every weekend, have turned my mental opinion of myself into that of basically thinking it human scum and everyone disgusts me. 
However the worst part for me was the dissociation, I started to have leaps and bounds of episodes like this from about 15. The only way I could describe it to people originally was like when you get waaaaay too stoned (I don’t smoke much atall anymore for this reason) and you get super uncomfortable in your skin and feel like you’re separated from your body. This got worse over the years until I started getting it that badly I wouldn’t be able to hold myself through it and I’d just start panicking. 
These plus many other things all accumulated into not suicidal thoughts but just not wanting to live, it felt too uncomfortable and overwhelming, like my brain was rejecting my body at all times even when I knew why I was upset It was too much. 

Here’s the weird thing:
I’m usually quite good at dealing with episodes, even when I’m that dissociative I genuinely feel unable to interact with anyone or thing around me etc, but for some reason recently I’ve been having a really strange type of one. So I get paranoid a lot that people are out to get me because of my PTSD or that my partner is cheating on me, but I can rationalise this. But recently I’ve been getting really REALLY paranoid about the dark?? I’ve never in my life been scared of the dark, I’ve always been perfectly comfortable standing in my garden in the pitch black having a cigarette. But recently there’s been these weird events where I’ll be out somewhere and it’s this generic gloomy and really dark sort of weather, ambient in a way. And I just feel like I’ve regressed back to a child internally. I get so intensely paranoid being there for no rational reason, so much that I nearly cry. It’s such an intense fear, and not that something is gonna go boo in the dark or come out to get me, but just this overwhelming dread. 

Any thoughts anyone??"
942,How has past drug use affected how doctors have treated your symptoms?,"So I decided to start the year off with getting help with my mental health. I applied to a community based center and got a call to confirm everything  and they told me they'd be in touch soon. 

I'm excited at the prospect of hopefully starting to figure my life out, but I'm also really nervous. I plan to be completely open and honest with my counselor about anything and everything. I feel that is the only way to truly know whats wrong and how to go about. 

Unfortunately I do have drug history. Nothing major, I've only ever done adderall and weed. I wouldn't say I've abused adderall. I have been smoking weed since I was 12, but I've stopped on multiple occasions when it was necessary. I'm afraid that if I tell my counselor this that I'll be labeled as a drug abuser, and therefore would be ineligible for medication which I think I need. 

I know that no one can tell me what will happen, but I'm just wanting to hear peoples personal stories so hopefully I can have an idea going in."
943,I can't think logically anymore," I have depression and I was able to think very critically. I could see patterns like in chess I could think out multiple outcomes,I could watch football and the mental **feeling** of how something could go or what could make it go better would pop into my mind. But now when I do anything I can't think I am unable to have words or actions or anything go through my head when I do something, it is painful. I was on a binge of smoking pot for maybe a month and half straight but i'm almost 3 weeks sober now. I was experiencing this same feeling the day after I smoked but now this feeling won't go away. I don't know if i have adhd or something but any input would be helpful."
944,"I actually can't stand the saying ""Happiness is a choice"".","I constantly see inspirational quotes about how happiness is a choice and it's frustrating to me.

Hear me out:

Yes, of course it’s a choice when life is going well for you because your baseline is already happy. It”s actually EASY to choose happiness when you’re already happy.

But when you are facing a hardship in life or you are feeling depressed- You are not waking up to sunshine and rainbows and butterflies everyday. Choosing happiness might not be in the cards for you when you’re struggling just to make it through the day. And that might not seem fair, especially when you see the people around you enjoying life and living so lightly.

But believe it or not, the struggles you are faced with are fair because in the end they are a damn GIFT. It may not feel like it now, it feels horrible and heartbreaking and hopeless. But slowly but surely each day will get better and you will get through it and become a stronger person.

And let me tell you, when happiness IS finally an option for you again, you will choose it and feel it so deeply in your soul. You will understand WHY you had to lose it in the first place and you will do everything you can to never let that feeling go."
945,I’m panicking over my partner,"Long term relationship. As of 7 years on and off, we’ve nerver truly gotten along, but we always ended up back together anyways. Now it’s been 2 years of being on, and a child is now in the mix. I’m struggling a lot W mental health in my own. 

Now the last year has been rough by all means. Circumstantial. But she has become increasingly distant to the point where I feel so lonely together that I’ve lost all sense of self worth. She’s dismissive whenever I show emotion. She’s thrown me out multiple times the last months, but I have nowhere to go and when she calms down she claims she didn’t actually want me to leave. 
Since of 4 days I passed a breaking point and started caring for myself, I got a grip on my sleep and started falling asleep at 22 and getting up at 5.30, being productive and making big steps forwards. It seems that has made her try even harder to ruin it for me. Takes every measure to make sure all my trigger points are pushed before going to bed, and making me responsible for kid+work+household during the days so she can spend her time in the couch on her phone, on which she has become super secretive about, since she told me she added her ex to make me jealous a month ago. 

I can’t even make sense venting this shit it doesn’t explain anything. So 

Tl;dr everything is fucked. I can NOT stay with my partner. So WHY, knowing that, do I feel utterly hopeless imagining standing on my own feet? I dread the act of moving out. I am so fearful of what life on my own will be like. I’m in panic. And it’s 3am."
946,Should I see a psychiatrist?,"So I have avoided making a post like this for a while as I didn't want to seem like the edgy 15-year-old but, I am pretty concerned for my well-being now.

Not sure how to start this so, I guess I will just say a bit about me; I am a 15-year-old male who has social anxiety and arachnophobia; I have for the last year or so been having not just suicidal fantasies but also fantasies of murder-suicides mainly featuring the 2 teachers at my school and my father.

The reason I am guessing why they are the ones who appear most often is that I blame my school for starting my current mental situation and my father for worsening it.

My school is a Christian private school and sadly not one of the ""good"" ones, there are only two teachers but, they don't really teach they are more so administrators as the only work we do are in books from some company called ACE (Accelerated Christian Education) which teach that the loch ness monster is evidence for creationism and somehow they even push stuff like the whole ""women belong in the kitchen"" thing into it what makes it worse is I am not even Christian anymore.

I think the main problem is my father with whom I tend to have a fight (Mainly him screaming at me) with him every week or two, afterwards he will sometimes apologize but, he never admits he is wrong; my worst bit of depression came after I fight I had with him in which I mentally started making drafts of suicide notes to what friends I have in case I actually did it I also know where my father keeps his gun (Colt Python) so, I also thought of which way would probably be the best and where I would/should do it while I was still pondering about this, he came back to insult me more basically saying I needed to man-up (I was crying a bit while thinking through this) another thing with my father is that he often gets mad at me for not being manly enough which is mainly about my arachnophobia and sensitivity.

My fantasies of suicide is not really new but, this is the first time I went into such depth thinking about what I would do before the suicide and how I should do the suicide I also used to think I might fantasize about it but thought I would never actually do it but, I have lately caught myself thinking about if I should do it or not.

I don't want to have to waste anyone's time or make a fool of myself over my edginess so, I have never even really pondered the idea of seeing a psychiatrist but now I am not so sure so I have come to Reddit to seek advice."
947,any tips on motivation?,"i literally don’t have any motivation to do anything

do y’all have any tips on getting more motivation or something?"
948,How to get out of floating rock mindset?,"So lately I've really been struggling. I have been finding myself struggling to do things because I feel like nothing matters, like I'm just a random person on a floating rock that is gonna die one day and none of it is important. It sucks and makes me feel like I have no purpose. Anyone feel the same or have advice?"
949,Is there a limit on how long hospitals can keep you after a suicide attempt?,I've been here a solid week and they dont have any plans for what to do with me. I want to go home because they dont even have anywhere to send me and probably wont for a long time. Am I allowed to refuse treatment at this point and go home? They were suppost to send someone from mental health to talk to me and see how I'm doing and if I'm good enough to go home but nobody came.
950,Not sure what should i do.,"I have posted this post before but didn't get any response so i thought I should post here. The title can give you an idea what's the post is about to be. So yeah I'm not exactly sure or maybe i don't wanna admit it because i have seen depictions of depressed people in movies or stories told by people around me. They always seem to lost their smile i don't want that i want to smile or laugh even at the times that i am unable to smile or laugh i will force my lips to form a smile because that's what defines my personality that is a happy dude, chilled, relax, don't wanna mind in other people's business kind of guy. Ever since childhood i have been brought up to be aware of what other thinks of you. How they see your personality or how do you dress, do they like you if not then maybe you're doing something wrong and change yourself and because of that i started hating the concept of people changing themselves for others to like them. My parents are great i never ever think that they have done a bad job at parenting my father every night tells us stories of legends or great people that have done what no other can ever dream of. He wants us to be like them be brave and do the things what no one can dream of he wants our will to be strong, my mother on the other hand loves me the most and that's why she's more concerned of my well being than any other child of hers. The one thing she hates the most is when someone makes fun of us that's why she did her best to make us look good so that no one would ever make fun of us so that we never have inferior complex. But by doing so she introduced the concept of change to us. The concept of that people are watching us and judging us. And I'm afraid of that afraid of my friends and family judging me as a person and i try my best to not let that happen i try to do everything in my power to make them happy even if im screwing myself in the process. I was never in favor of cutting oneself i always hated that concept yeah i like scars but inflicting those scars that might never heal is what i don't like. But ironically i do self harm not for self pleasure but to punish myself because i couldn't make others happy. I was brought up in a strict family there was always a punishment so next time we will be more careful of doing anything stupid but then my mother would cook something good for us as an apology because she loves us. That punishment part stayed with me as i grew up everytime i did something bad i would punish myself not by cutting because i hate that but by punching walls to a point where my hand got all swollen. The part of being judged and left alone is what scares me the most i have some secrets that i have never told anyone else except my best friend and she has helped me a lot in this matter always scolding me when i do something bad (self harm) or make my mood off because of people she always tell me to not give a fuck about anyone and live your life as you want but i can't help but do all those things because I'm afraid that i will get judged and people will laugh and they will leave me alone. Because of things my friends and family are more important than anything but people keep leaving me without any reason and leaves me with a question was it because of something i did? Did i say something stupid? The person who once had a lot of friends now only has few friends and family and slowly by slowly I'm losing them one by one. So yeah I'm not sure whether i am depressed or not I'm not sure what should i do."
951,Don't know what's wrong with me.,"It's hard to explain but i just want to know what's wrong with me? I have troubles understanding someone else's emotions. For example let's say you find a 100$ from the ground, I can see that you're happy but i can't understand why. Sorry if it's a vague explanation. It's hard for me to feel empathy."
952,Self care during a depressive slump,"I’ve been diagnosed with clinical depression since 12 and I’m almost 25 now. The holidays are always terrible and I spiral out of control with my depression to where I feel like a shell and I become so anxious even taking care of myself (making sure to shower or brush my teeth). My health has begun to suffer and I feel like my backs to a wall on how to begin to pick up the pieces and this is the worst I’ve gotten. 

I’ve never been given true pointers on how to get back into self care to just even do the basics of self hygiene like brushing my teeth everyday or making sure to shower and I was wondering if anyone had any advice or routines I could try to get at least a little back on track on the self care front? (Sorry my thoughts are all over the place)"
953,I almost commited suicide 3 months ago. How i am now,"I think it all started probably 3/4  years ago (high school), when i (19M) started feeling that i was quite different from my colleagues. I've always been that guy that never goes to parties, mainly because i fucking hate the music they play and i don't drink alcohool or do drugs. I prefer 1000x going on a walk through the city with my little group of friends. That's obviously not the reason i felt sad for being different, it was because of my physical apeareance. Not just for being a very skinny guy (not that much), but because i had (and still have) the worst acne, etc...  

So, high school was over and it was time to choose a degree and since I've always had been a very good student i basically could have chosen the degree and uni i wanted to go and despite having low self esteem, I've always been ambitious and confident of my capacities so i decided to choose the best university in the country, that was 200 miles from home. Rented a room, and it was the first time i was living alone. Little did i know that the first year would be the most difficult of my life. It was mental draining, but I held on there. I spent the summer holidays on my hometown with my friends and it was the best three months of my life, every day we exercise, went to the beach, had long walks at night, etc.

I almost forgot that I would have to go back to the 2nd year of the course and I think that's why it cost me more. So, I had zero motivation to sit in front of the desk to start studying and suddenly i couldn't even do what I thought i was best at. I went into a downward spiral of lying in bed all day and skipping classes. I was always saying that the next Friday was the day that i was going to end this all once and for all. I wrote some letters explaining the reason and giving me the strength to continue the path without me. My plan was to hang myself with the belt hanging from the thing on which the curtain hangs. So, friday arrives and i text my flatmate asking how long he would be out and he says that he's coming soon. That destroyed my plans cause i had read somewhere that this type of death takes 10 minutes and i didnt want him to save me in the middle of it. So, in the next week i was alone and went for it. I pulled up a chair and put the belt around my neck with two openings, the one on my neck and the one to hang on. With a spoon I fastened the belt so that it would not come out as I pushed the chair. Basically, I was ready and the moment I kicked the chair I regretted it because I started thinking about my brother. Not that I hadn't thought about the impact that the decision was going to have on him, but I remembered that he is the most important person in my life, I never spent a single day without talking to him. I was extremely lucky not just for getting out of it but because my spine made a weird nose the moment i let go the chair and i was okay. 

So, next thing i did was to call my brother, sayng what i had atempted doing and he started crying. He sayed that he would be nothing without me, and obligated me to freeze my course and take a break. Then i talked to my mom and she reassured me that everything would be okay and even told me that when she was younger she also had atempted it with pills. I was extremely surprised because i didnt imagined it. She encouraged me to not stop and it was the best thing i could have done. I collected myself, went home and chose to have the classes online. I ended up the semester with one of the best grades of the class.

Since then, I've refused to go to psycologists because i feel better. I didnt talk with my mom about that since then but she asks me regularly if is everything ok. Obviously Im not cured, I still do not feel well but this experience was an eye-opener of the importance I have for certain people and I reformulated new goals. I will adapt the rest of my life to what I feel good doing to not return to the point I once reached.

Stay strong, if you need someone to talk dont hesitante for a second. Reach out to me, im happy to meet New people and to help you!"
954,When I thought I was out of the woods,"I have been doing pretty well with depression and anxiety for a while now. I had some things go very wrong today. Nothing too horrible, but all my self hated came flooding back. I have not felt this way for a long time. I'm sure or will pass, but whatever I have been calling progress feels like a joke.           
           
Before the difficult stuff happened today I had an appointment with a therapist and thought that maybe I didn't need a therapist anymore. (Cue bitter laughter...)
               
                 
I am pushing sixty and imagined that at some point I would not feel like I have since I was about ten. It's really discouraging."
955,still love ex after break up,"It was TERRIBLE but it was so intense. If he compliments me my heart just melts, but he's so mean. He gets scary and says he wants to hurt me. He broke up with me because i raised my voice defensively so then i said i need professional help or else i'll kill myself! after we calmed down he said i'm endearing and cute and a roller coaster. i have a boyfriend but i'm still infatuated with my ex. we flirted a bit but then he called me unstable and he had another girl and I get so jealous of her but he assured me he prefers me over her. I said I hope she dies. I'm attracted to the emotional distance but it's so unhealthy. how do i stop idealizing him"
956,Regain your mental health,"When you disable or disempower your fight, flight, or freeze reflex your body can restore its natural hormonal balance. This may take several to many nights of restorative sleep to do this, which is impossible if your body feels threatened in any way. This makes it impossible for the body to self-initiate the healing process as it is too consumed with amping your defensive mechanisms up, sucking the resources from all the other things that need attention. Disease, inflammation, and pain tendencies are curbed if you feel fulfilled from restorative sleep. This also restricts the body's ability to create stress, anxiety, and depression.

NuCalm is the only thing on the planet approved for relieving stress, anxiety, and depression without any side effects and without anything entering your body. It literally coaches your brain and body to retake its natural place as the center of healing. I have been there and now lead other people away from PTSD, TBI, addictions, and other maladies.

957,How to obtain social skills with some weird hurdles,"Okay. Im 25m. Im working . My whole life before was school and house. Rn it work and house . I don't have any so .(kinda broken rn in regards to that also because of that im not that stable) or many friends . I have one but that person is really busy with work , school and business. At school all I do was study and play in my phone or read books and play video games all alone.
I don't have fun in social activities and I find it super draining. Now where im working im not in a spot where I should make friends because that would be seen as favoritism by my higher-ups.
How to I learn to have social skills or how to learn them.?
Have read /listened to audiobook about phycology and gAmetheory and things like that and I found it like its more akin to me manipulating people instead of forming bonds and friendships.
Im more versed to transactional interaction as thats the only thing I really do. 

Any help or advice is appreciated.
Pls don't say get a professional that's my last option. Tbh I can't afford it rn. As I need the money for my family's food and bills ( I pay some of our house bills to lessen the load on my father,)"
958,How do I approach my parents about wanting therapy?,"I have decided I want to go into therapy to better myself and learn how better to deal with my anxious/depressive thoughts. My parents have always been the type to take my shortcomings personally as “failing as a parent” and in general haven’t been very open to mental health discussion. Nothing wrong with them, they are just very old-fashioned. Though I can finance myself, I have insurance through my dad’s plan currently so I can’t hide this from them. What’s the best way to tell them I want to try therapy? Got any personal experiences or wisdom to share? Thanks in advance"
959,"I cut myself with a razor blade for the first time today and I'm scared I won't be able to stop, how do I?","So I've been dealing with some sort of mental illness for quite a while, I've just recently seen a therapist but was yet to be diagnosed before the sessions stopped. I only saw them for a couple months and unfortunately I don't feel much progress was made. I first cut myself with a pocket knife like two or three years ago, it was one with jagged teeth and was very dull, so successfully doing damage was a hassle. I cut myself, not as a suicide attempt, but because I bottled my emotions so often, when I finally exploded, all I wanted was to make something hurt like I was hurting inside, but since I hate violence against others and never wish to hurt anyone, I cut myself. I never told anyone, even my therapist, although I was very close to opening to them but then my sessions were cut off so that went out the window. Cut to today, I decided to find out how sharp razor blades actually were, I unscrewed one from a pencil sharpener and slightly scratched my arm, I barely even felt it, but a couple seconds later it started bleeding, it was so easy, so fast, so painless, I did it once more with similar results, and now I'm terrified that now I have such quick easy access to something like this, I won't be able to stop myself, especially during one of my breakdowns, what should I do, I know I should tell my parent but I am terrified of what will happen and to be honest I'm not sure why I'm writing this, I highly doubt I'll take any advice anyone gives me. I don't believe I'll live much longer any way so what's the point, if you do read this, thank you but no advice is needed cause I doubt I'll listen. Have a good day."
960,OCD while hypomanic?,"So, in february of 2020 I've been diagnosed with depression and OCD and I have been on meds since, but I'm suspecting I might me bipolar, because I've been dealing with depression for periods of time it may last months, but when it ""goes away"" and I feel ""good"", not just good, but like excellent type of shit.

That's when something weird happens and I'm showing symptoms of OCD, whether is checking things, doing compulsive research, etc...

The thing is, I have not been checked by a psychiatrist since april of 2020 and stopped going to therapy, and I think I'm ""(hypo)manic"", and when I feel like this not much time later I get OCD symptoms and feeling with much anxiety, so I'm worried I'm going to be like that soon.

Maybe I should go to a hospital?

I can't afford a psychiatrist as of right now and they are not accepting new patients due to covid, only if you're suicidal they give you an appointment or something, so I want to be really sure of what to do here.

Thanks in advance!!!"
961,I genuinely feel like I’m going mad with imposter syndrome.,"I should pre-face this by saying that I have diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder, C-PTSD, and manic depression.

Last night - I probably sunk to the most humanely devoid I have ever been. It was genuinely terrifying how emotionless I felt. I posted on Reddit where I spoke about how I was feeling.. Apathetic.

I woke up this morning honestly convinced that I didn’t have any dopamine or serotonin in my body. Not even 2 hours later, I willed my body to make a coffee just to nourish myself as I haven’t been eating, drinking or sleeping well.

Well now I feel like a fucking Jack in the box on a manic high. I’m just buzzing around my house cleaning my depression cave, I feel like I could run a marathon and I want to paint (one of my hobbies)

But I feel like an imposter. How can someone go from one extreme to another? I feel like I couldn’t possibly be that sad if I’m able to flip a switch this fast."
962,Is it unhealthy that I don't enjoy having friends?,"Hello, I think I need help? I don't know, I kinda don't like to have friends. I have people who want to talk to me and chat and catch up and I honestly do like them all but I just can not will myself to make chatter every day. If the only options are talk every day or don't have friends I will always pick the no friends route.

I have been diagnosed with OCD and general anxiety disorder at 10, got my ADHD dx at 26 and at 27 dx with having a depressive episode (covid and my grandad being terminal and unable to see him).

I just really don't know why I'm like this, it seems abnormal, I'm super friendly and chatty when I'm out and about. As soon as I'm home I just want to be left to my own devices. I feel like the outside me is just the socially obligated version of me and my actual me just doesn't crave the love and attention of people.

Am I okay? I think I'm fine just a bit weird but other people seem to think I must be sick to not want to have friends. I am not shy, just a loner. I don't get it and wonder if anyone here can tell me if I actually have an issue I'm completely oblivious to (I had an eating disorder for years and legit could not see it so I'm paranoid it's like that?) or if I'm fine to be like this. I don't feel like I'm ""allowed"" to not enjoy having friends.

It isn't even that I dislike having friends, I just can't keep up with the demand of what normal people seem to need to maintain a friendship. It ends up feeling overwhelming, stressful and just over all too demanding to keep up with. I'd much rather be left alone than feel obligated to have to talk when I really don't want to. I understand it's callous and selfish to only want to talk at my pace so if rather just not have the friendship than be a bad friend. It's mentally exhausting for them to keep chasing me and it's mentally exhausting to me keeping up with them so it's better to just try to not have friends in my brain.

I don't seem to have a commitment issue, I've been with my husband for 10 years and married for 4. I love him and do want to talk to him every day unlike friendships. He is the only person I will crave to talk to and I seem to only have that with him. I don't even want to talk to my family but the only thing helping me maintain that is just deep guilt if I don't. 

Thanks to anyone who read this. I don't know if I'd prefer to be mentally ill or have a bad personality. I at least would like to know why I am like this, if I need help or can just enjoy my hermit life knowing it's fine for me to enjoy hermitting."
963,Complete exhaustion from a out-of-the-blue anxiety attack.,"Is it normal to feel exausted and slightly drowsy from being really stressed, or having a bad anxiety episode? This is the first time ive felt this exhausted from the two."
964,What do you think are the most common issues that teenagers of today face with respect to mental health?,And what sort of help do they expect for such issues?
965,I think I may have paranoia..,"So.. I was home alone in my kitchen practicing my singing and all of a sudden I just felt super unsafe, as if something else was in the house with me. Now I know there wasn't and when I told myself that it eased me but then the fear quickly came back. I tried calming myself down by going to the hallway that was causing the source of my fear 

(it's long with a window at the end.. I don't like windows especially if they're on ground level for anyone to just peek through)

When I stood forward staring down the hallway, and shut my eyes, I felt fine.

But when I turned around, with the hallway behind me, closing my eyes, every fiber of my being was telling me to turn around and open my eyes because there could be someone behind me. It even seems like every sound around me gets amplified just to increase the urgency of me needing to turn around.

The reason I closed my eyes was because I've heard facing your fears can help alleviate them.. and closing my eyes was definitely facing my fears.

But is this a normal fear? Do I seem paranoid?"
966,Does real gore effect your health?,"Does watching videos of real life gore effect your mental state badly? Sometimes I can’t stop myself from watching videos of real gore and after watching some just now I started to twitch and it was like a dinging was happening in my brain, like my brain was a bell and it was shaking my body, pulsating around.

One effect I believe is aggression which I definitely noticed,usually when I’m doing something fun and don’t want to be disturbed if someone talks to me for a long period I’ll think something like “please fucking stop” or “please fucking shut up” but I noticed myself leading to aggressive thinking much faster and my first thought being “oh my god I’m going to fucking kill you, shut the fuck i am fucking end your life” and the thought of what would happen if I took action entered my brain.

Before I began watching such I was in perfect mental health, I have stopped until recently and I am in perfect mental health. Looking back on what I just wrote I had done I think it’s fucking insane and I can’t imagine saying or doing such. 

Can I please get confirmation? Because I really can’t help my morbid curiosity."
967,Am I going crazy?,"I feel like I'm going to dissapear, just completely vanish from this world, I've felt this for the last couple days but it comes and goes throughout the years, I can't wrap my head around the feeling or thought and I have trouble understanding that it's not true, I feel numb and have trouble eating which makes me believe it's my depression causing this but it feels completely different. I'm a teen and have dealt with mental health issues since I was just a kid, I started having these thoughts when I was 14-15. I can't find anyone talking about a similar issue which makes me feel like I'm crazy, I need answers"
968,I dislike virtual school.,"I have been virtual for almost a month now and will be for another month. I hate it. I don't get to interact with my friends and teachers face to face. I go to a different school and in my normal school, we are virtual so that means that I cannot go to my other school. I started to be online when my brother got Covid, then my school went online, and then my mom is gonna have surgery, and I volunteered to help her. The worst part is that I wanna go, but I also wanna stay home because of stuff like waking up later than 6 in the morning, and things that happen when a lot of people are online at my other school. I also have cried many times today because of this, and I feel like I am suffering."
969,Do I have PTSD from something I haven't experienced?,"I live in an area full of gang violence/knife crime, I have grown up with people who know lead gangs but chose not to go down that path. I have never witnessed any stabbings but have heard of many, only a month ago someone got stabbed two houses away from me.

Whenever someone mentions knife crime or tells me about someone who has been stabbed I start to have a panic attack (I have anxiety), this may be fine as it is a scary topic but I also feel as though I'm about to be stabbed or someone I know is, almost as though I'm in that situation and have no escape. So my question is why do I feel like I'm having a flashback or stuck in that situation whenever that topic comes up? is it PTSD related?"
970,Do you think that my father’s beatings to my mother affected me?,"I’m trying to move on with my life. I need to know if an event like this can affect an 11 year old (my age when this happened) to the point of degrading his mental illness. I remember the months when this happened. I also was very tired during those years due to playing soccer excessively and a bit of sleep deprivation. Was being bullied (Verbally, not that bad really. Just constant jokes that made me mad). Transitioning to middle school which I remember put a lot of pressure on me. This was 6 years ago. Before that I remember being clearly happy and social, I was excited about my future. It was great but after that I just didn’t feel the same. Doesn’t help the fact that he has done it again sometimes. Not daily but at least one time each year. Mom is not any better tbh. It all feels like a shitshow and I feel like the only one who hasn’t moved on. He’s still my dad. He’s a nice person on a day to day basis. I just want to get my shit together that’s all. Hope you can help me"
971,what can I do to help a family member consumed with their paranoid schizophrenia? (esp during a pandemic),"My whole family is trying to be there for this family member and is trying our best. It has definitely taken a toll on everyone and their mental health especially when our mental health has already taken some hits with the pandemic. We are really trying our best but really am not sure what more we can do at this point or where we must draw the line especially when this person is putting our physical health at risk because of COVID19. 

Recently their mental health has been the worse it has ever been. Multiple family members have offered a place to live or to take them to get the help they need but it is hard when they deny extensively that they have an untreated problem and always leave the house unaccounted for during a. They stayed with their sister in northern California since November but just yesterday has left and refuses to come back. However, during those times, they were at their sisters place they would drive to southern California and stay at a hotel or see family members without notice to pick up belongings and mail they have left here for like 2 or 3 days in southern California and head back up.  Sometimes they would do that multiple times in a week. They would enter our homes with the keys we gave them and not say anything to grab things or stay the night without any call or permission. When staying with their sister they would just leave and go somewhere that was non-essential and then come back without saying anything and when confronted would belittle their sisters concerns of illness and the pandemic. Now they left their sisters and came back to southern California where they is originally from but with COVID substantially worsening in our county and in California and them always going out and doing non-essential things my household and most of their other family members cannot really let them stay with us as a result of their behavior putting others at risk and their attitudes towards this pandemic. 

To give you all more context this person has been diagnosed by two different doctors and has recently ended up in the emergency room multiple times for one issue, but the staff had found their paranoid schizophrenia to be the actual one and them refusing that help. This has led them to not believe in getting medical help for anything at all because they believe they do not know what they’re talking about. They do not believe that their schizophrenia is actually real and is actually the result of the doctors implanting a transmitter in their head during the first time they was getting help at a mental health facility. Since their second diagnosis they have refused to take any medication for it as well. They believe that they are a part of a government project where the people in their head are using their credit cards, hacking into their phone and car, and altering their genes by changing their hair white and stuff on their body with the use of an implant in their head. They only eat one meal a day because they are suspicious that the food might be poisoned by these people or doesn’t want the weight gain that these people have altered them to have. they deny their mental illness but truly believes the truth is what was mentioned earlier. they has expressed to me that they are sick of these people and want justice but after going to authorities like the police, the bank, the hospitals where they cannot give much help to in the way they wants they then believes that they are a part of it. They even believe their sister that has been giving them a place to stay and the rest of their siblings are also a part of it. At times they would get really angry and yell at their sister about this stuff and even though I can’t imagine how much of a hard time my family member is going through with this mental illness I can’t even imagine how much their sister and their family is going through too with all the yelling and arguing and mean things being said to them.

972,I have never had my work manager satisfied with my work. For some reason that bothers me a lot.,"I work in software sector. I have been high achiever in school. But as i hit the industry, in 8 years, i have never had a manager who was satisfied with my work. I have always gotten negative review. 

This bothers me more than it should. It makes me depressed. 

Because of my upbringing, i have certain traits which make me compulsively miss deadlines, never say 'no', not stand up for myself or justify myself etc. Because of these and some other reasons my work is never satisfactory. 

I feel huge imposter syndrome, failure, taking unworthy money, stuck etc etc. If i quit, i ll feel like a even bigger failure. I have this urge to prove myself to this team.

Have you dealt with such a situation?"
973,Can't stop obsessing about MBTI,"For almost 2 years i have been heavily interested in MBTI and identified as mostly INTP (also INFP, ENFP, ENTP, sometimes even ISTJ, ISFP or even ESFJ or ESTP) but every so often i crash and feel insecure about not being an INTP, and actually being a type I hate like ESxJ. It really bugs me because the two others girls in my group home just took the 16Personalities test and got INxP.

I honestly don't feel like an INTP at all but I cling to the label online to look cool. It means i get to be like Karolina zebroska or Lou Reed and seem like i have Iq 5789304534786348796457867456.

I know what you're probably going to say. That MBTI is bullshit and like astrology and I should just move on with my life and forget about MBTI. But I just can't. I can't stop thinking about it. I try to list good things about myself that have got nothing to do with MBTI or intelligence. I like myself for my skinny bod (but probably not naturally because I have an ED and used to be fat), my taste in music, the fact I use Reddit and Quora and not fucking Snapchat and Facebook, how I know how to knit or how to kind of play guitar and piano or how to bake a chocolate cake or how to draw anime, i sometimes write horror and maybe poetry and stuff, yet in spite of all of this I still feel so insecure. I always feel insecure for whatever reason, mostly MBTI/intelligence or my weight.

When i get really really insecure I can't help but feel like avoiding people because I cant help but compare myself to them yet thats kinda ironic if I'm asking for help now. What can I do to ease off my obsession and become way more confident?"
974,Forgive yourself for the times you weren't able to do healthier coping mechanisms.,"I have had countless of coping mechanisms for my mental issues like alcohol for my social anxiety or extreme diets for my body dysmorphia. I'm tired of blaming myself for not choosing healthier coping mechanisms, so I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that at those exact moments, those mechanisms were what I needed to survive. Now that I know better, I have a better chance of resolving my issues better, but I have to forgive my past self first."
975,How can I understand my depression episodes?,"I've always been depressed due to many reasons from the past and the current situation at the time, so I was pretty much a ""zombie"", so Until I turned suicidal, from a certain point I was extremely unstable(which I wasn't when I was just numb and generally sad), going to this desperate desire to die to being numb or normal again. 

The thing is: a lot of the situations that caused this whole thing started to become better, to a point where I would be really happy, but absolutely nothing would happen and boom, there's the desperate need to die. Now I'm really fine, but those episodes aren't clear in my mind because I don't know what started them, nor how they stopped. I feel like I had almost no control over them, so I fear they may come back, right now it's already 3 months since the last episode but I really want to understand them.

Also I've never went to therapy or anything of the sort, due to me still being underage so isn't my choice to go or not, and I am absolutely terrified by it."
976,My OCD is affecting my sex life,"Since I was a kid (diagnosed) I would get so upset when anyone sat on top of or under my sheets in my bed without showering first. I wouldn’t even let my mom sit on the end of my bed because in my mind “outside germs” were spreading onto my bed. It became a habitual thing I needed to do: no touching my bed without showering and washing my hair (habit has been bad for my hair but that’s another story lol).

Flash forward to be being 21 now and this is still something I do with myself and I cry at the thought of not. I’ve been talking to a guy and we’ve messed around a few times in my bed (washed my sheets immediately after). But now I have a problem:

Tomorrow we are going out and won’t be home till late. I would like to be intimate after we hang out but am so terrified of the “outside germs” that’ll be on him  (ex if his elbow touches a cart at the store that same elbow will get germs on my bed). I don’t have a laundromat near me that’ll be open after we see each other and am frustrated with myself for this delusion"
977,I don't know what to do anymore and I'm starting to give up,"I don't know what to do. I'm always feeling like 3 seconds away from ending my life. I've asked for help from my parents and even some of my closest friends but they can't understand what I'm going through and it's almost as if they think it's a phase. I've become aware about how easy it is and it's terrifying me. The only reason why I haven't done it is that my mum's been really stressed lately and I can't just add to that. But I just don't see any point in living anymore.

So I've always hated myself for something or other. 

From a really young age I've had a terrible memory and it's gotten me in so much trouble. My step dad thinks that i make it up but I don't. I could literally go to the bathroom to brush my teeth and forget to.

My sister has been diagnosed with ADHD and autism but before she was diagnosed and got the help she needed it was quite bad. She was angry all the time and she couldn't focus at school. It got really bad and she had a bunch of episodes, where she'd trash her room and hit people, as her sister she mainly hit me. I was young and scared to tell anyone but even so I had a bunch of bruises and she'd even hit me in front of my dad and he wouldn't do anything. I eventually gave up trying to tell anyone because it didn't seem like it was important. 

I've always struggled to be around a large group of people and would rather me left alone. When in public or even in a group of friends I feel like I can't breath or it's hard to breath. My heart also either races of slows down making it feel worse.

Sometimes I feel like I'm split into two different people. As in, I have thoughts that contradict eachother and sometimes have conversations in my head. I always want to know what's wrong or right about me so things like sexuality and gender has been so hard to figure out.

Four years ago I hallucinated, I think, a man following me back home from my school. I had a similar 'hallucination' on the bus. I've also seen small things like stuff moving when they're not and seeing things that aren't there.

Around 5 years ago I started feeling depressed. At first I thought it was something small and something that would go away over time. But after two years I just deteriorated. I wanted to die but I found hope with my friends and the thought that everything would get better. However by the start of last year I just don't get the point of living, It's getting so bad that every three seconds I want to just end it all.

Around two/three years into my depression I told my mum that I wanted help but because I was kind of young and always seemed happy I think she thought it was too important. I told my mum again during first lockdown but she thought it was because we were trapped inside. I then told her again, or thought I told her, near September. I've become so paranoid that I didn't actually tell her and that I imagined it because it's like I never told her. I'm constantly second guessing what's real and the hallucinations are making it harder to tell what's real."

979,abusive relationship has caused my anxiety to worsen,"recently got out of an abusive relationship (1.5 years) around a month ago. i am struggling with really bad thoughts of self-doubt and self harm. he would say things to me like how i was a burden or annoying or how my anxiety made me a selfish person. everyone who loves me tells me this isn’t true but i feel like everyone’s motivations aren’t pure anymore almost. he would say nice things when he wanted something from me or wanted to manipulate me but when he got angry he would tell me he was lying and when i broke up with him he told me some really bad things that i keep thinking about.
i don’t love him anymore and it’s not an issue of letting things go but how do i stop feeling this sense of “everyone doesn’t care about me or is just showing it because they want something” because it keeps getting worse and worse and worse.

i feel like i’m isolating myself from everyone. i am sleeping all day and i have stopped eating. i am so anxious all the time and even though i know it’s dumb i can’t stop it.

and then i feel like i can’t talk about my anxiety because i’m being selfish.

it just feels like it will never stop and i just want everything to end.

me and my boyfriend started dating when i was 15 and i’m 17 now, and i just feel like this relationship has taken such a bad toll on my life."
980,I have a problem but the solution might make it worse.,"So I'm going to start off saying that I like firearms. I enjoy shooting them, hunting, and im wanting to get into competition shooting. It's the only thing I am currently interested in. The problem is I know that my mental health is in decline. Alot of days I am depressed and usually just sleep for the entire day.I also find myself detached from pretty much everyone.Overall I just feel I'm losing my grip on reality. I know that I should see a mental health expert but if I get diagnosed with anything I fear its going to ruin my ability to use or get firearms. That would leave me with nothing and my life would be meaningless.I am not suicidal and I don't want to kill anyone.What should I do?"
981,The new year has been shit,"
2021 has started off terribly I lost one of my close friends on New Years and saw what happened I didn’t like the sight of it and seeing it at all and I have been down since then and it’s hard to cope with what is going on with anyone especially since I had to broke up with my girlfriend of 3 and half years 4 months before because she was more focused on other things in life than me Android me that you were never my priory to begin with it killed my self conscious and my confidence we tried to make it work again but I just didn’t see it going anywhere but the same cycle so I had to end it before I got hurt even more

I’m broken and I want to cry and be held by someone and I just can’t and everyone keeps asking me what happened to my friend but I don’t want to talk about it at all I’m just venting here to hopefully help me relax myself a bit 

I do know that time will eventually heal me but right now it doesn’t seem like and I know it is very Cliché but it is just what im feeling thank you for reading and trying to help if you write a comment"
982,Changing strategies,"This year I decided to address my conditions as opposed to trying to hide, cover up, and avoid them. The current strategy has made me weak. I’ll be going back to the old strategy with new knowledge to help it work better. That being said, I don’t think I’ll be in this group any longer. It’s time to bury myself in my work and stop wasting my time thinking about my deficits or talking about my problems in therapy like a pathetic wallowing child. I wish you all the best of luck."
983,I just set up an online dating account after months of procrastination and shyness.,"Im excited guys, I rarely talk to people so this will be a nice pace of change."
984,An apology to myself,Hi guys I’m just writing this as a means to apologize to myself for being mean and critical. One goal I am wanting to make is to be nicer and kinder to myself and I would like to apologize to myself for being critical to myself while playing super smash. I got so frustrated at making mistakes that I was insulting myself and thinking of self-harming (didn’t self harm btw). That was really unnecessary and it’s just a game at the end of the day. I hope to be better by understanding myself and my limits and that it’s okay to make mistakes and build progress.

986,Toxic sister,"This is a little long but I seriously appreciate anyone who can help me out with this.

I am a 15 year old boy, with a 19 year old sister in college, with a widowed mom. Ever since I got into high school my sisters been on my ass and tried to seriously put me down and say things to my mother to try to get her to love me less/get upset at me. I try to ask my sister why she does these things and just makes up dumb excuses, but two of the times she has revealed that she does it because “If she couldn’t do it, I’m not allowed to” type stuff. 

For example, I’ve been working my butt off to do get in school and when I missed 1 week of science, I did bad on a quiz and my science grade dropped to a B- semesterly and c- quarterly. (Note all my other grades are As”. Right as I got up the stairs to go to bed, she yelled over to my mom (he has a c- in science) and stuff like that and purposely tried to fuck me over with my mom. I’ve always wanted to do online school, and when she brung up false shit to my mom because I had a good argument on why I should do it she looked back at me and said ( if I couldn’t get into Alabama (the university) than you can’t do online school. 

I can tell the reason she does this stuff is because of jealously, and me maybe being the more favorited child and her having a “rougher” life, so she wants to put me through what she had to deal with. 

How do any of you recommend I deal with this? I really don’t know what to do anymore. She is degrading my mental health and trying to ruin my future. I’ve tried talking to her politely and it won’t get anywhere."
987,How to not feel empty? I met a guy that really helped with my depression and I want to learn how to feel better on my own.,"So I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years ago and it’s kinda controlled with medication and therapy, at least the anxiety part. But I still feel like a void, a emptiness, I don’t know how to explain but I’m sure a lot of you can relate. It’s not like I’m unhappy with my life or myself, I’m just not happy either. I just wake up, do my things, go back to sleep and repeat, I don’t enjoy much things. Like I do have hobbies and things that I like to do but i just feel like meh, very apathetic. All the time. 
The thing is, two months ago or something I met this guy and we clicked. We ended up not dating or anything although we both liked each other a lot and we are not speaking to each other anymore and like I’m fine with that, this is not the problem. The thing is, when I met him and during those months we were “together” I felt really, I don’t know, happy I guess. He made me really happy even when we weren’t together or talking. I woke up everyday feeling like idk this sounds really silly to me, but it was like my heart was full. I was in such a better mood the entire time, smiling, enjoying way more the things I normally do, even things not remotely related to him. Like I literally had better days at work, I was MUCH more creative ( I work in a creative field), things that bother me didn’t bother me as much, I didn’t feel so drained and sad at the end of the day. Even my friends and family noticed that I was in a really good mood all the time, like smiling, making jokes, being very happy and not worrying as much as I normally do. He really was a good influence in my life and in my mood without even trying. 
And now that things are done with him I noticed that I’ve been starting to feel really empty again. It’s not like I’m sad about not being with him or anything, I accept that. This isn’t like a relationship problem. I just can’t understand why someone could have such a good impact in my mental health and now out of the sudden I’m back to normal. I know that I don’t need another person to feel complete or anything but at the same time I also feel like he did made me complete for a while? I don’t know. I’ve never felt anything like this even when I was in long serious relationships, I still had my issues despite being with someone I loved. 
So how can I go back to feeling like this alone? I really thought for a long time it wasn’t possible for me to not feel empty and actually be able to enjoy things."
988,I’m afraid that I DON’T have a disorder,"Now before you think that I want a disorder just to get attention, you’re wrong. I feel like I need a disorder to justify the way I am. At first I thought I’m bipolar because I have some of the symptoms such as irritability, anger, lack of concentration, aggression, loss of interest, etc. But then I saw on some video that some are very active and I’m not that active beside from taking jogs outside sometimes. So I thought I had borderline personality disorder because I had antisocial behavior, social isolation, anxiety, distorted self image, self harm. And that brings me to here. So do I actually have a disorder(s) or  am I just trying to find a reason why I’m like this?"
989,Help me please. School Sucks. (Tw) Suicidal thoughts,"School is extremely draining and after the Winter break, I'm back to hell. During lunch break the only thing that's keeping me from running into traffic is my friends, the thing is they're not in my Cohort and a grade older than me. I'm not sure what to do because I still have so many years left of high school. Another problem is talking to my parents, they always keep pushing me to go well not knowing the full extent of how bad my mental health has been due to School. 

How do I help myself, Please."
990,I feel like I'm losing my grip and husband is considering separating,"Throughout our marriage I've struggled with depression and anxiety that only got worse after having kids. We've been together 6 years, and I've always had the bad habit of laying in bed on my phone. The truth is I don't know what else to do because I don't have the mental bandwidth or energy to do anything else. I tried a few different medications, I tried psychedelics, I tried therapy. I'm just getting worse.
The last few months I've found myself being a worse and worse mother to our kids who just need attention. My husband struggles with depression himself, and my mental illness has taken a toll on him.
I am overly attuned to the emotions of people around me and I realized a while back that it takes a big toll on me to be around other people. I worry too much about how I'm effecting their feelings all while getting overstimulated off their vibes (like body language/tone of voice that expresses how they feel) I've started dreading my husband coming home from work because I know I'll have another person who's emotions I have to deal with when I can't even deal with my own.
He has been telling me recently that he can't take this anymore and something needs to change. He said he doesn't want to leave me because he loves me but how I am every day is taking too much of a toll on him.
Honestly I just want to be alone. I want to walk into a forest and be alone for the next 6 months. I don't want to separate from my husband because he's my best friend, and guilt tells me that leaving isn't an option because my kids need their mother. But I also feel like everyone would be better off without me. I just don't want to burn any bridges.
What do I do? I don't know how to be better. How can I climb out of this hole when I feel like I'm losing my grip? All I want is my husband to be supportive and tell me it's going to be okay but he's hurting, and part of that is my fault (he had depression way before he met me so I can't take all the blame). My kids need a stable and present mom and I'm neither of those things."
991,The absolute worst day of my life,"First off, I want to start off by saying that I understand that people go through much worse things in their lives daily, however, this has incident has affected to an unreasonably, and I understand that there will be worse things to happen to me and to others. To fully understand why this has has such an effect on me you’ll need some background information: I’m a teenager, and in 2019, my mother bought herself a lovebird but the bird tragically died in July of 2020 and my mom was left distraught, however, on September 22nd, I decided to get my own lovebird. I raised this lovebird since she was two weeks old and right away, I was in love and extremely attached to her, and as time went on nothing much had changed. However, in December 29th, I began to notice my bird acting strangely and saddened, so I allowed her out of her cage to see if she’d perk up and indeed she did, so I assumed she just want spending enough time out, however when she went back in, her mood would change, and I didn’t think much of it, this behavior was also being shown the day after, till on New Year’s Eve, when I’d let her out of her cage she just wanted to stay asleep in my hands, and I really got worried but my mom told me that she was fine, but we’d be able to take her to a vet on the 2nd of January since it was a holiday and no vets were open passed 5 PM that would see my bird, so I reluctantly agreed. But when I woke the day after, I check on my bird and she was too weak to even use her legs and I was absolutely heart broken because I knew what was going to happen, I knew I’d lose my bird and it hurt more than anything I’ve ever gone through. To some, this may not be a big deal but for some reason, it broke me to see my bird in this condition in the first place, I tried to feed her, but she’d through up her food and the entire time all she wanted was to sleep in my hands, but I kept trying everything, I even tried the antibiotics from my mother’s previous bird but nothing worked and my bird died, and I hate myself for it, I would’ve preferred if it was me dying instead because such a loving and helpless animal didn’t deserve to die, and all I want is my bird. Needless to say, this is probably selfish of me and my attachment was probably not healthy for me in the first place, but I couldn’t help it. This was undoubtedly the worst New Years Day of my life and arguably the absolute worst day of my life yet."
992,I can't take this shit anymore....,This is too much for me
993,chronic outcast syndrome,"i guess is a symptom of mental illness??? lmaoo

i have a lot of friends and do well in romantic relationships but literally never feel like i can fit into a group. ever. even in “welcoming communities.”

i’ve always wondered what was wrong with me. why am i always rejected? yet it seems like i can maintain long term relationships with people (on only an individual level). What does this mean? Am I just “my own person”? Am I unique? Is it that social difficulties are simply a symptom of a mental illness i have and if i got proper treatment i would find my place??

It’s really hard to look back and notice this pattern. Like, really painful. There are a lot of people with trauma and they don’t stoop as low as i have. I’ve never had a problem getting/holding down jobs but i’m never a really member or the group or larger community. 

Do I work on accepting that I’m a gets-along-with-individuals kind of person? Or do I address this as something that i should try to change for my own happiness."
994,is hallucinating common or should i be worried?,"every so often i start hallucinating, it usually only happens for a day every few months but recently I've been hallucinating wayy more than usual. like less an a week ago I had a hallucination day when i saw things everywhere and at one point saw this character i like from this TV show. today I've been hallucinating smaller things like big movements which aren't there. is it common for people with anxiety to hallucinate or should i be concerned? i don't have schizophrenia because i can still concentrate on my work and stuff. just a little concerned, hope someone can help answer my question!

thanks for reading all of that if you did, much appreciated."
995,How do I get my motivation back,"So for about half a year now I’ve been in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life I think , I’m still going through it but I’m noticing small things improving. I’m speaking to my friends more again and my eatings getting better, I’ve started therapy and I’m on medication now - but all and any motivation I had for anything can’t seem to come back , I’m in the middle of my second year of uni and I’ve got no work done because of this , and I don’t want to blame the depression because it’s me that hasn’t done the work. My motivation for my subject I’m studying (illustration/art) is fully gone and hasn’t came back , my love for messing around with food is gone now I jsut eat what I’m given , making music - you see where this is going — I know it’s a long path and it takes time and small steps and what not but it’s freaking me out that I jsut cannot seem to get motivated to do what I know in my heart I still or used to love - is it ever gonna come back? And even if it does will it ever be the same as it was? I know this is a big post and I understand if people don’t respond but any advice or answer is welcome even if it’s a blunt honest one. Much thanks"
996,Why is it hard to be put into a mental hospital for a significant length of time?,"It was common 40 years ago and why all of a sudden they decided to do this care in the community scheme, which hasn't bettered the whole situation!"
997,Differentiating reality,"So recently me and a friend were talking about a cartoon and he said something close to this “they aren’t real. Don’t tell me you think they’re real” Honestly when I was discussing the characters of the show I was referring to them as if they were real. This question took me aback because I couldn’t really answer it. To me it felt like they were real even if i didn’t have any intense personal connection to them. What is this feeling? It’s like I believe these fictional characters are actually real. I’ve experienced mental disorders like dp and dr that do affect my grasp on reality, is this some extra part of it?

Thanks"
998,Been feeling happier since I got a health scare &amp; the fantasy of dying soon without having to kill myself is helping me cope even better.,Idk why i post what I post. Just venting my personal secrets anonymously I guess.
999,any advice/reassurance?,"i really need advice. this is gonna be nothing short of a novel, so if you’re willing to read it you’re amazing. i’m making myself vulnerable which i know isn’t the best idea, but i honestly have so many issues that keep me up at night. and now i guess i’m gonna start. 
so i’m a 15 year old boy. i have a sister who’s a few years younger than me and reminds me of myself but we don’t really spend too much time w each other. anyway, i have two parents that love me more than anything, a roof over my head, etc. so u could say that i’m rly lucky, which i am. having a happy, great and supportive family is not something that everyone is given. and i’m well aware of this. anyway, when i was younger i used to spend all my time with my parents. i’d snuggle w my mom and watch tv, or go on walks and draw/build things w my dad. obviously being 15, i spend way less time w my parents. whether it’s because i’m always on facetime w my friends, or just doing my own thing, i’m pretty much in my room 24/7.       i rly miss being young sometimes. and ik this is common. and my parents are literally downstairs so why can’t i just go be w them? probably bc as much as i want to spend time with my parents, i wanna do my own things too, as i listed above. plus it’s obviously not the same as it used to be regardless. 
so i do have a pretty typical life. but i’ve always felt different, despite having positive energy from friends and family. for one, i’m gay (i guess) and live in the south, and attend a very conservative private school.  i used to get bullied, and it was awful. i’ve changed my style, my hair, the way i make my voice sound in public, etc. just to seem straight. some of my friends there are a lot like me, and some of them know i’m gay. that’s not my concern though. and to be honest, before i make myself vulnerable by listing my issues, i’m not totally sure what my concern is. i honestly don’t know where to start, but please keep reading as i’m about to name everything that i’ve gotten stuck living with. 
first, let’s go back to 7th grade, where about halfway through the year i really wanted to try nicotine. by march, i had hit a vape before, and i was so proud. (and this is cringey as hell but i won’t lie) i filmed it and showed it to friends, and even though i didn’t even inhale it correctly (therefore i didn’t feel it) i felt cool. i wouldn’t say it was totally peer pressure but it was probably a bit of that. it was really just pure curiosity. 
fast forward a few months and i’m using nicotine numerous times a day. i wasn’t rly vaping though, i was stealing my mom’s nicotine gum because she used to smoke a while back and uses it to stay cigarette-free. and i’m gonna come back to that in a sec.
later in the year, i starting taking vyvanse to treat my ADD. it was prescribed obviously, and it really, really helped me go from smart but lazy, to smart and motivated to work. and i’ve been taking it ever since. anyway, later on in the year, i would get caught stealing the gum by my mom. this was in November 2019, a month after i had a sudden and weird, week-long period of unexplained and crippling panic attacks. i still haven’t figured out what triggered them, but it was hell. any who, when they caught me i told them i wanted to feel that calm feeling provided by nicotine, and that i started taking it from her in october to ease my panic attacks. that was a lie, which was very wrong for so many reasons, but it got me out of trouble. and they believed me. i hate lying to them. it makes me want to cry and just break down completely. but lately that sympathetic feeling of the need to be truthful has faded. i continued using her gum, and got caught again, used the the same excuse, got out of it. fast forward a few months and the pandemic arises. just like every kid attending school in the world, i’m on Zoom everyday. i still took my vyvanse and home, obviously bc i was attending school. but little did i know, the feeling of that pill at home is nothing like the feeling at school. it felt amazing, at least for me. i felt creative and had a long lasting sense of well-being. again, fast forward, it’s now summer of 2020. and i’m taking my vyvanse, which i’m only supposed to take on school days, every day. and now, present day, i still take it everyday. even if i go to bed at 5am and wake up at 2pm on a saturday, i take it when i wake up. if i don’t, i have no energy or mental drive. and i think i’m addicted. i cant fucking stop myself. i want to but i cant. and since august, i’ve been vaping a pod a day. extremely expensive and i know it’s awful for me. i haven’t gotten caught with the excessive use of my meds or vaping yet, but if i do, it’s gonna be horrible. i cant fucking face the look of disappointment and sadness on their faces. i’ve also lied about stealing their alcohol from time to time, etc. and they love me and think i’m some honest, healthy teen. all of this stress and underlying guilt is making me depressed. i know i probably need help and i’m honestly at rock bottom. i know, if you’re still reading this and have advice, you’ll advise me to talk to my parents. but that’s harder than anything. im only 15 and i honestly don’t know how much longer i can remain sane. IM 15 AND IVE FUCKED MY GOOD LIFE UP SO BAD. and a lot of the time, you see adolescents using things like nicotine or alcohol to cope. but i don’t have a reason. i have a nice fucking life, and i’m so lucky. but somewhere along the lines i lost faith in myself, in my well-being, and in my future. i’m okay with the idea of being a fucked up adult. i shouldn’t be, but i am. i know so well that the path i’m headed down is bad news. i know i’m smart and i know i could be successful one day. but i cant get past this mental barrier. and this list just keeps going. i’m gonna pause again, and go back to the topic of my sexuality real quick. like i said, im gay. but my weird and lifelong issue is, i like men. not boys, but men. i’ve never really crushed on a boy my age, i’ve always been attracted to grown men. that’s so fucked up, and the most upsetting part is, i don’t see myself being in a relationship with one. i don’t even know if id have the courage to have sex. you’re probably disgusted at me right now, and i am too. and i’m not done. the last real issue i have which i’ve discovered recently, is that i lie to my friends. not in an immoral way, but honestly a weird, comical and entertaining way. for instance, i might say i fell down the stairs to make them laugh, and then tell a whole story about it when nothing happened at all. but these weird and somewhat pathological tendencies i have are beginning to get out of control. a lot of my friends are like this too, so i don’t feel as alone tbh. but i’ve concluded that because of my sudden lack of self-care, and occasional wishful thinking + made up lies, i have a personality disorder? i just wanna be happy, and i just wanna be healthy. and because i’ve finally made this realization, i feel like i’m ready to fix myself. i know this was so much and i honestly think that some advice from a kid my age or an adult who can understand my situation would be really aiding. reddit is not the place to go for mental help, i know that. but i’ve gotten advice here in the past and i think that before i figure out what i need to do to change my ways, that’s what i need. if you read this i want to thank you because i really need my story to be heard."
1000,*insert interesting title*,"Some people say, ""Just talk to me and release what's burdening you."" but when you finally open up, they start to fade away too xD I think I'm being too intense for my family and friends. I just always know that they won't understand what I feel and think and how I could possibly have them. They say it's just in my head and I can control it, but I often feel out of control. I don't even seem real to me sometimes. I get that not everyone will understand, but sometimes I just wish I could have someone who's just.. there. I miss my dad. 

If I really could stop it, I would. Who wants to suffer this much? 🥴 

It sucks, but that's life and I'm still too exhausted to put on a happy face for them, so ig I'm going back to isolating myself from everyone."
1001,I cant fall asleep,"I have to wake up for school at 7 tomorrow, but my sleep schedule has gone to shit and the past week i fall asleep around 2 in the morning and wake up at 12. Im so stressed about missing the zoom call im thinking about just staying awake till then, but i have a few different calls throughout the day and if i pull an all nighter i know ill fall asleep later in the day and miss my other calls."
1002,Not sure whats wrong w me?,"I don’t want a diagnosis from someone on here, i just want advice so please dont think im trying to self diagnose or something. Oh and possible tw cw? 
I’ve been to my psychiatrist a good amount of times in the past 3 years, and i finally got a therapist. However, I havent gotten an official diagnosis for what problem(s) i might have. 
I am obsessive with my thinking, i have intrusive thoughts that i hate having, multiple mood swings, and i hyperfixate a lot. They say i dont have adhd because im not hyperactive. but i lose focus in anything. Im horrible in school without my stimulants and my mind is racing constantly. I dont trust people with knowing things about me or secrets because i dont want them to think im weak. I want to be perfect, smart, and everyone’s favorite but dont have the motivation to do so. And when people replace me or make another friend i get upset even when i tell myself i shouldnt. 
Oh and because i dont have a diagnosis, ive been researching non stop what problems people have and trying to find the name to whats wrong with me.
I feel like im making up problems i actually have. And like im manipulating people or something, and trying to validate my horrible behavior, but i dont think so because im so concerned about my own behavior and accidentally hurting people and myself. But i have good morals, its just difficult believing myself when i dont even know myself. So, can anyone give my ass some advice so i dont freak out even more? Lmao"
1003,How did you get over your shame?,"Hello, people of Reddit!

I guess this is a bit of a vent, but at the same time, I would really appreciate any feedback from you. So here goes.

I have these annoying intrusive memories that I have always attributed to guilt but recently realized that they are all just due to shame. The problem is that I can't get over them.

I never hurt anyone, but I did enough stupid stuff that literal years go by and I still remember all of it. I still feel like physically crawling into a corner and curling up into a ball whenever I find myself thinking about any of it. I find myself wanting to ""forget"", although ""lose consciousness"" is probably closer to what I actually want. And that is a scary train of thought right there.

I've actually been imagining myself proving myself to all the people who in my mind despise me for my actions (I don't think they care about me in real life). The way I do it is by imagining them seeing my life and thoughts through my own perspective, and subsequently gaining sympathy towards me. I sometimes wonder, ""Is that even normal?"". 

But then I go right back to doing it because it makes me feel better about myself. I would do it for hours as a kid. That was my usual past-time. I'd imagine a lot of fake scenarios to gain more and more sympathy from these people ""inside"" my head.

And now I just feel ashamed. I think I am slowly outgrowing this old coping mechanism of impressing imaginary people, now it just makes me feel ridiculous sometimes.

But I am still very insecure. For example, I am overweight and I am afraid of anyone seeing me trying to diet or exercise. I would avoid walks/runs because I just hated it when the cars would pass by me. I feel bad about saying anything because I feel like people can piece together my past and realize that I'm only saying the stupid stuff I am because of the moron I am.

How can I ""get over it?""."
1004,Im just kinda down,I’m just scared for my mental health because im self depreciating myself and have recently had hallucinations of creepy “monsters” in my room.

1008,Falling into deep depression,"On Wellbutrin for 3 months now. Binge eating everyday !!!

Here’s my story:

2019 - my daughter was molested by grandfather. Found out when she made a comment “grandpa put cream on my private so I won’t get rash” took to doctors positive for chlamydia. Blamed myself for everything attempt suicide.

2020 - got into a car accident. My daughter didn’t make it. Watched her pass away while ambulance was on the way. Now I have PTSD, nightmares, flashbacks. Blaming myself because I was the driving. 

I’ve took Zoloft, Paxil, and sertraline. Now I’m on Wellbutrin, I’ve been constantly binge eating. Will the other medications I did as well. I thought this will help me. I’m at 200lbs already. Usual weight 160-170 Which is making me more depressed. I wear bagging clothes and oversized shirts. I bought waist trainers and fajas. I know ridiculous. Now I’m taking diet pills which hasn’t helped. Now I started to throwing up. I don’t feel good doing any of this. But at the time this makes me happy. Obviously this isn’t normal. 

I wish I would be myself. But I can’t. My daughters gone and it’s my daily. Holidays were tough. Her death anniversary is coming up. I do go to therapy weekly but talking to my therapist makes me forget about all this &amp; I talk about random things. Not mention when I left my husband (2 month marriage got married on my impulsive decision making ) he send me a text “go Kill yourself right this time. Maybe there’s a reason you survived the car accident to remember you didn’t deserve your daughter &amp; everyday you will live with that” that replays in my head everyday maybe it’s true I don’t deserve to be happy I deserve this pain.

I’m at my lowest now. Throwing up to make me feel good is a sign I’m falling into the wrong direction."
1009,Complications,"Hi

Im going to try and make this as short and informative as I possibly can. Im posting this for some advice/support through a complicated ongoing situation.

I sometimes struggle to put my thoughts into words so please bear with me as this is difficult to write.

First off, here's some background.

I'm a male, 22, living in the UK and grew up with a single mum and low wealth.

I've struggled with mental health issues from my early teenage years. These include depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, self-harm and suicidal thoughts irritability, often causing reckless behaviour.

I'm now convinced after doing months of research and experimenting that I could have ADHD and/or Bipolar disorder, and am struggling to get the right support and treatment as the system here is difficult to navigate.

I dropped out of both school and college twice due to issues with hyperactivity, difficulty concentrating and periods of depression, often leading to me staying off for whole weeks. My mother would lie to the school on my behalf to keep me off and allow me to rest. 

My mother didn't like cooperating with healthcare professionals but I believe from applying what I have learned recently (in regards to bipolar and other psychological disorders) to her behavior when she was alive, that she also had bipolar. She never sought help as she was mentally ill and I didn't realise at the time as I was too caught up with my own life. 

In college, I would either stay off for weeks due to a severely depressed mood, or show up with no sleep due to hyperactivity, but I only realised this recently. At the time I put this down to juggling a relationship, job, college and moving away from home, and so did my doctor at the time.

I found it really hard to cope in a classroom environment as the slightest thing could distract me. But I was too scared to speak up about it and just accepted that I had other stresses and that was why. ""Just deal with it"" I thought.

I was in a relationship during my teenage years from the age of 16-20 and my partner would always tell me I was ""fine"" and didn't need to go to the doctor when I had bad thoughts/feelings and would help me through them. I trusted her because I thought she knew everything and always acted like she was correct, even when she wasn't.

These are both traits that were displayed in both my mother and ex partner, making it difficult for me to seek help.

She also convinced me to move across the country so we could be together while she studied. I agreed because that's what kids do when they first find a relationship like that, I had nobody to tell me otherwise and I knew none the better.

This caused many complications.

When we broke up my life spiralled out of control and I turned to drugs and alcohol as an escape to the feelings, and I discovered (recreationally) ketamine.

Ketamine was a problem for me for a while because it made me feel amazing. Not because of the high or some kind of addiction, but if I took it when low I would feel normal FOR WEEKS at a time. This is another thing I noticed from experimentation with myself and reflection on memories from taking it before.

My mother passed away soon after. Of course this was a bad time but I still experienced the highs and the lows, only the lows were much worse.

After staying with distant family for a while when I was grieving, I then decided to get my own place. I moved city, got a job, 

Lockdown happened a month later, and I had a lot of time to focus on things I've never had time to do, learn and really understand.

Staying sober and focusing on myself allowed me to pick up on something:

I started writing down my thoughts and moods to track them. And I notice a pattern with periods of highs and periods of lows, lasting weeks or longer.

After doing extensive research I'm convinced that I have a certain kind of bipolar disorder and also ADHD.

Now instead of staying in my bed for days with lights off when depressed, I've tried microdosing ketamine (illegally)  to relieve the depression symptoms and it really helps. In unimaginable ways. 

Im concerned that I end relying on ketamine on order to feel normal, as it is an illegal substance and not easy to acquire, especially for me as I am not wealthy.

Now, my issue is that the system here is very difficult to navigate, especially during Covid times, and I am struggling with my own thoughts and emotions to the point where I have thought hard about ending things when I'm feeling low.

I've been in contact with the GP and they referred to me a psychologist, who then gave me access to online CBT group classes (which I'm still waiting for) but I haven't spoken to them, the assessment is just going from my medical records and what the doctor has told them based on phone call from myself. I know I will benefit from greatly from CBT but I feel like this is not the right treatment long term.

My concerns are:

I've been on anti-depressants for the past year and I still get depressed, along with the elevated moods and in patterns. Im concerned they either make my brain worse or I get addicted to them.

The system here doesn't work for people like me who dont have the right support. I've seen it first hand. Many people I know either personally or through others have taken their own lives because the system has failed them or they havent had the right guidance and I refuse to be a victim of this.

Will this worsen as I get older?

My questions are:

How the hell do I get all this information through to a doctor so I can get the right treatment? Every time I call I find myself not being able to get any information across as I speak nonsense without realising at times.

How do I go about my life dealing with this? Do I just tell people before I let them into my life I have slight bipolar and ADHD and hope they are understanding?


I have goals, ambitions and talent that I can't nurture due to this. I want to get back into education and get myself a specific degree, even though I have to start from the bottom. I know am not stupid and am capable of doing this but I feel like I've had a broken support system for my entire life and I feel lost.

I really need pointers and advice.

Thank you for your time reading this."
1010,I think I should go to the mental hospital but I’m afraid it will be too costly for my parents.,"I’ve been dealing with self hate since I was four and depression and anxiety since I was eleven. I’ve always thought I was fat, even when I was a thin child. It’s never gone away, not with therapy, not with confidence boosting stuff (clothes shopping, moral support, yada yada). But right now it’s pretty bad. I don’t self harm, but that’s only because my pain tolerance is very low. I am having suicidal thoughts and there’s only one thing keeping me here really. I know that if I die, my family won’t take care of my pets. My dad is dumb and doesn’t believe my pets need what they need, my brother is quite lazy, and my mom doesn’t like what I feed them. I think I have good reason to go. I know that if these pets died, I would be happy to go. I recognize that I need help, but I live in a country where free healthcare doesn’t exist. Plus, pandemic! I don’t know how to tell my parents how I feel either. When I was younger and I told them they got angry and victimized themselves. I don’t want my
Mom and dad to go through the stress of thinking they did something wrong when it’s all in my damn head. I don’t know how tight we are on money, as my parents don’t tell us that to keep our stress limited. I don’t want them to think this is all some scheme to get out of school, but then again I don’t usually complain about school much. What should I do? I’m really at a stand still. I’d love to go, I’d love to get serious help. I’ve had a therapist but I just can’t open up to her. I’m stupidly afraid of opening up to her. I feel like that maybe in that environment where I don’t have a choice, where I have to open up, I’ll get better."
1011,"Almost 5 days into the New Year, and doing well!","Well, I am really happy for myself. I am five days into the new year, and my mental health has not been pushed to the extremes like it was a few weeks ago.

I dunno if I have any mental health problems (i.e. depression, anxiety, bipolar, etc. there is a family history of depression that I only learned about two years ago in my 20s), but I am diagnosed PDD-NOS (basically autism spectrum, but no defined trait that equals Aspergers or something similar) and that can make for a f-ing interesting experience as a person. I can get overwhelmed, and poof, I blow up at people or I say some stuff and it gets me in trouble. However, that is what I hate most about it, when people get mad at me for blowing up. In my mind, my brain starts telling me I am a worthless POS when it happens and its a feeling of guilt washes over me. I often refer to it as my Catholic guilt (I am Catholic, so I say that).

However, its almost January 5th, and I have not blown up at all or been pushed to a breaking point. We got close to one today, I am not gonna lie, little mix up at work. But I have gotten to the point where I have disconnected myself from work, I work in a very toxic work environment where mistakes result in a person being verbally abused into submission by managers when it happens. It’s a learned trait all the managers learn from other managers. In fact, I promised myself come March 1, I am going to have a new job and be away from this company. In fact, when I leave, I plan on NEVER shopping there again as a protest. The company has other issues too. A big one being the lack of diversity in management and the corporate structure. The politics of the company also has become very much apparent in the past few years, when they were famously apolitical. The CEO likes to kiss a certain party’s feet, but tell us he’s not interested in politics. I don’t care much for that at all. Oh, and now they are mandating meetings at our store that all full-timers, part-timers, and everyone has to attend in order to learn “friendliness.” What does that mean?

Anyway, I’m just happy I am doing well. Glad I will be out of there soon."
1012,(TW) su*cude &amp; depression p3lls,"When I was around 14 (it was june 2019) Im currently 15 now and turning 16 this year. 

I remember specially this one time where  I had a huge bottle of over the counter medication. I was crying and I was trying to convince myself to drown myself with the bottle. However, I wasn’t able to convince myself to. I knew I wanted to but I couldn’t get myself to do so.

Now its 2021. Im finally getting help. I haven’t gotten diagnosed since I only ever saw a therapist. However, I learned that living life was better than not doing so. To everyone thinking of doing it, please know that its not worth it. You have a whole life ahead of you. 

If nobody told you today, I love you. Your beautiful. Your strong. Im proud of you."
1013,I FEEL JUST UTTERLY MISERABLE,
1014,Addicted to Checking Things,"I don’t think addiction is the right word, I just don’t know how to put it. I just have a serious compulsion to check things, even things that are completely set in stone. I’ll have packages held at the post office and I’ll still check 10+ times a day to “make sure the packages are still there”. My final grades have been finalized in the grade book for two weeks now and I know it’s impossible for them to change but I’ll still check multiple times daily “just in case”. I catch myself often going back and looking at my grades from past semesters just to see if they’ve changed. 
There are other instances of this happening too, with more mundane things. 
Any tips on getting this under control? Any idea what causes this?"
1015,sad sad,"I have never been diagnosed with anything but I know for myself that there something is wrong with me. I don’t like to say I have this and that without a proper diagnosis, but I just can’t do life anymore. I would rather be dead (i’m not suicidal) i’ve gotten past that but its just the thought not that i would harm myself bc of how life is right now for me. I feel like such a burnout. Throughout my 4 years of undergrad I always worked full time while as a full time student to support myself/tuition. I graduated this past May and feel like I have nothing to show for it. I went from waiting tables to working as a paralegal. This job has immensely drained my soul. From having a hostile work environment to draining work and shitty attorneys to work for. It feels like im in high school since everyone is just so mean and people love to start drama. Ive been looking for ways out, careers changes but I just cant seem to lift a finger. I get distracted so easily. I feel like I suffer from anxiety but I’m not sure if thats 100% the case. I feel overwhelmed with life every day and get to the point where id rather cry and be in bed all day to escape reality. Idk I just wanted to explode and vent since I have no support at home."
1016,I forgot to tell my therapist I’ve been suicidal,She asked how my week has been and I just said bad and then we talked about other stuff. I’ve been depressed for so many months now and it reached new lows in the last week. I just want to function again. I don’t know how long I can go on like this. And it can’t get much worse. I’ve fallen into crisis mode quite a few times in the past week. I’m scared if it happens again I’ll just snap. The worst part is that going to a psych ward wouldn’t even help. So my options are just live like this or die I guess :)))
1017,Mental health issues in the family,"I have anxiety, depression and possibly other issues. My parents also have severe mental health issues, which made their marriage very toxic. I’m an only child. My parents are all I have, I care about them very much and they care about me, but sometimes their anxiety and depression can be so toxic and I can get really frustrated as a result and get triggered and upset. They sometimes have paranoid beliefs that can be really hard to deal with. 

I don’t deny that I also struggle with anxiety and depressive thinking that may annoy them. I feel extremely guilty as a result of my own annoying behaviors and feel like a terrible child everytime i get into an episode. I don’t know why I get so anxious and frustrated, when I cool down I look back at myself and question why I lose my cool quickly sometimes. I don’t know if anybody can relate, just looking for comfort while dealing with complicated emotions."
1018,I (19f) think I may be toxic and I think it may be due to my bipolar disorder but I need help on fixing myself. any help or advice is welcomed,"To preface; I have Bipolar Disorder II, have been diagnosed for over five years and take medications but over the past couple of months have been struggling taking medications. I’ve set up a plan to keep myself accountable for taking my medication.
The point of this post is to acknowledge my issues and work towards fixing them. 

I’ve had people tell me before that I’m too much and I’ve spent the last year trying to work on myself. Sometimes I’ll catch myself. I’m not sure exactly what I’m doing but I want to fix it before it ruins a friendship or relationship. I’ve been the reason for issues in my friendships and relationship before. 

Sometimes I feel I make things about me too much
and I have a generally negative outlook that results in my responding critically to others or placing myself in a higher thought than others. 

I know this isn’t something that is fixed overnight but if anyone has advice on how I can continue working towards getting better and being a better daughter, friend, and partner please let me know. 

I don’t want to be this way. I want to fix it but I can’t afford therapy."
1019,The last few days have been awful.,"Nothing really specific happened. I’m just so lonely all of my friends have left me, and I feel like a shit person. 

This all happened awhile ago, and it goes from being awful to being fine. Currently it’s extremely bad on my mentally, maybe top2 worst weeks since everything happened.

Like this week, and another week like 3 month ago have been the 2 worst by far. 

I just feel incredibly worthless. And school starts again in a week and I am not even close to being mentally prepared. But it’s not like I can do anything about it, my family has been pushing me to take enough classes to graduate ASAP because I’m a burden on them I guess. Idk"
1020,My life is a waste,"I'm almost 24, I have no skills whatsoever, I suffer from depression, anxiety, and suicidal tendencies. I have no clue how to express myself emotionally. I haven't talked to my closet friend in three months, I have never held a job for more then four months, I haven't been able to get a job in the past 21 months, I only have 6000 dollars and a broke down car that fails to start left to my name. I feel as if my life is some sort of dry humorless tragic comedy and there is nothing I can do about it. The last time I felt half way ok was playing cyberpunk 2077 but now I've been told that because of my enjoyment of it I'm an idiot and deserve to die. I littery wake up every day to sit at my computer watching YouTube or sit on the couch watching TV. I have no clue what's up with my life or what the hell I'm doing with it."
1021,Do I need help? Feeling stupid,"Backstory: 2011 tropical stroms rolling through the area over the weekend and friend needed a place to stay had been sleeping on park bench trying to get back on his feet. I opened my home and allowed him to stay for just over a week. Soon after I come home from work to find wife has packed up and left no explanation. Confused i call around and was told she had slept with the friend when she took him to his mom's. The big D was filed 2 months go bye and she let me get the kid for the weekend, that sunday she joins us for a family day and never went back to her moms, The D was never final and were still together. That 2 months I was in a dark place, I attempted suicide several times, went days on end without food or sleep. I bought a pistol and when I couldnt use it on myself I attempted to track down the former friend with no success.

Today: its been almost 10 years and im still haunted bye this. My brother gets out of jail in 10 days and wanted to stay with us. Me and the wife are both excited to see him out and trying to get on a good path. 3 nights ago I look over her shoulder and see a pic she sent a friend of our family calender marked with the brothers release date surrounded bye hearts but the actual calender was not drawn this way. I lost it and asked what was going on being told it was a joke and told the friend told her that didnt look right. So i asked why did your friend have to tell you this why dont you know this? And how much do i not know? I stromed out the door and drove off to cool down. I call here and tell her im fine and coming home and wanted to see that it was indeed a joke and nothing else but get told she deleted all her facebook messages when i blew up about the 1 i seen.

So after all this I dont come home slept in my truck at work and woke up to go stright to work sunday. I got off about 1 and headed home. Nothing was said about the situation we didnt talk we just sat in quiet for most the night. I get up this morning and texted her telling her I needed the number for brother probation office I was no longer confortable with him staying here and she lied saying she didnt have it on her she would have to find it (She had given me the number out of her phone a few weeks back). I get ready for work and see my confrance recorder laying on the nightstand. I picked it up and swung bye her job before going to work put it under the seat and turned it on. She got home relized it was missing and went looking and found it, im currently in a hotal room while she cools down. 

I talked with my brother who admitted his relationship with my wife has gotten closer than ever since hes been in jail but swears its nothing like that yet understands my reaction due to our history.
The friend she was talking too sent screenshots of tge messages, the whole details appear to be innocent however even she told her tge hearts were overboard.
My hurt was the fact she didnt think it was harmful it was just a ""joke"" and continued hiding and defending her known actions.

Did i go too far? After 10 years i still blow a fuse at the simple things will i ever regain total trust in her?"
1022,2 Concussions while active duty; Am I going crazy?,"Hello. To make this short, I've had two concussions, about a month apart from eachother. And both concussions I blacked out on, and had dizziness for a long time. 

It been about 3-4 months now since the last one, but I feel I've been getting worse. I can't remember ANYTHING to save my life. I get so frustrated over tiny things and ""blank out"" when I'm too stressed. I can't tell sometimes how far things are away, like a car door handle or my shoes below my bed, I'll go to grab them and grab the floor now. I have a huge trouble focusing, it's part of the reason why I've been putting off enrolling in to college. I always feel fuzzy, and the worst is my balance. I have horrendous balance and it's the most irritating thing ever. Recently, I woke up from an awfully vivid dream with a bad nose bleed.  

This is literally ruining my life, and I haven't told anyone about it because I just have so many other problems. Am I being too paranoid? Could these things be caused by something other than just dumb concussions?"
1023,I’m trying so hard to do good.,"I’m 23 and a veteran and I’m diagnosed with bipolar and a borderline personality disorder. I ruined my marriage due to my own stupidity and I’m going though a divorce at the moment as well. I get so paranoid that people don’t like me or people just hate me. 

I’ve moved back in with my dad and brother after my husband left me and I’m still getting in life altering arguments and I’m not even meaning too. I miss my husband so much because he was my support system and someone that could help me though stuff with my family but he’s not here anymore and I just feel like I’m getting worse. I can’t even explain how hard my mental health has deteriorated over the last year and I’m really scared of myself and I just wanted my life back to what it was. 

I’m so fucking sad and angry all the time. I don’t even know what my personality is anymore. Anything I like I’ve sold such as my sneaker collection which I had about 200 pairs at the start of 2020. I’m hurting so bad I miss my best friend more then anything and I miss my mom who died about three years ago. I just want my life back that way it was before I started to get paranoid and crazy. 

I’m hurting so much and I’m tired. I feel like I’ve ruined my life and myself. I have good cycles where everything goes good and then I crash hard. I feel like the army ruined my whole fucking life because I was to scared to get help when I started to notice things wrong with my mind. I fucking hate myself for not getting help because I would be doing better and probably still be with my husband. 

I just wish I could start my life over or something because this is not what I wanted. I feel trapped and stuck here.  I feel like such a fucking loser."
1024,Truth Hurts,"I am a sex addict. I am a recreational drug addict. I am addicted to steroids. I am destroying myself from the inside out: my organs, my skin, my hair, my face. I look like a freak. I feel completely incompatible with other people besides my significant other. I come off too intense, I cannot relate to others or maintain any significant relationships with people as friends. No one likes me and I believe there is a broad consensus about me that I am unaware of but everyone else IS. Like a joke that everyone is in on except me. I am quite certain that many people laugh at my existence and gain from my suffering.

Only having my s/o as support makes me feel like shit because I am such a burden, and that is a lot for one person to handle. I am sick and my mind is so full of shit; negativity and self hatred. I am immensely lonely and I use social media to fill that gap, much akin to how one might jam the wrong lid on the wrong jar just because it “kind of” fits. 

I feel empty. I feel like I have two (or more?) people living inside of me, I feel tormented, abused, and held captive by myself, but at the same time I have the awareness I am the one perpetrating it upon myself, my life. Like an Orobus, a snake eating its own tail.

I don’t understand where my feelings of insufficiency and smallness and fear of being seeing as effeminate come from, but I have committed my whole being to proving those things wrong about myself through my physical form. 

I am grateful to have this clarity and I will make a conscious effort to see a psychiatrist and begin medication, but at the same time I feel like this is all just a movie playing on repeat, that I have been here before, and somewhere, deep in my mind, I know that it ends in tragedy (my own). I don’t want that, and I’d like to avoid that, but it also feels somewhat inevitable. It’s like I’m in the first 5 minutes of the movie but I’m allowed to pull the slider to peek at the last 5 minutes.

I see posts like mine all the time on here and I scroll past them, yet here I am in the same position. I should have commented and made you feel seen, or heard, I am sorry I didn’t. 

I am asking you in my time of need to please see me, I feel really alone."
1025,Imposter syndrome,"I’m pretty sure I have a minor form of depression and I have confirmed anxiety but every time I do something I just feel like I did it wrong, i was playing basketball and anytime I did anything not perfect I just insult myself and now I’m thinking about all the mistakes I made during practice and all I can think is I don’t belong there and I’m not good enough and I’ll never make the team next year and I’m horrible, does anyone have advice to deal with this stuff (like good coping mechanisms, I can’t stop thinking this way and I just hate myself)"
1026,I think im a furry,The weird thing is that i started to feel that way after i got given new type of antidepressants that also made my hands shake. I started to take weaker ones but now... well you know. Im not a suiter tho so thats good i guess.
1027,Stop doing this ! (vent),"I know theres many people that dont believe in mental health. That dont understand how average to how serious it can be for different people. I have too many 'adults"" in my life that are just clueless on the subject. If someone tells you they have a mental health disorder of any kind... feel loved. It's hard to communicate for them in general I can assure you. We dont fully understand it ourselves so we are all learning here. Then take what information they gave you and educate yourself. If your son or daughter has anxiety/depression/PTSD (there's so many things) look into it. Im sick of having to constantly remind my family members what is and isnt okay during my husbands mental health journey. The person I had to talk to and remind (yet again) that yelling at my husband doesn't help... should know damn well by now. If someone you love is having a panic attack-- FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK-- dont ""shh"" them! Dont say their name in a ""shushing manner"". Dont tell them to shut up. Dont be little them.  Dont yell. Dont use triggering phrases like ""calm down"" or ""relax"". You obviously dont know what a panic atrack is. Just how real the panic feels until you've been there. Either contribute to grounding them in a respectful manner or shut the fuck up and let the people that do... Do their job! *drops mic* rant over. Fuck."
1028,I just want a hug...,"Hello, TLDR at the bottom of my wall of text,

 I am a 15 year old wierdo that has HFA (High Functioning Autism) and is also a geek and bi... and also lives in the small country town where stereotypical cowboys/cowgirls that are homophobic and rascist idiots live. I'm not the brightest but have been told to a how smart I am to a point of compliments make me feel like a dog being praised for doing something that is simple to a human. My family is...odd to say the very least. One older brother iwth Aspergers, one mom with ocd, and a dad who's been serving as a transport and guard of the court who may have stress issues and burys them. My friends are nice. From as much they know about my sexuality (telling them that i'm straight to prevent terrible things) they are good people...just homophobic.

My school day go's like this:

Wakes up and go's to school

ELA:is okay i'm barley awake to care and where reading Ready Player One (3 time reading)

Math: Drives me to the point of hiding tears through self-esteem issues and that nowbody understands how to help some kid with autism. (grade 10 and i'm working on grade 8 math in the corner)

Computers arts: everybody notices me for once and uses my wimpazoid brain to help them change colour of things on photoshop just to have them forget about me at the end of class

Home Ec: Get frustrated at myself for being the only guy in home Ec separating me and my two closet freinds breaking the school part of our friendship. 

Phys ed: it's physical education the one thing that holds some importance for my fatass. The sports part is just stupid and make me have panic attacks and sensory overloads making look like a big ass baby infront of everyone.

Home: has a shower after bus ride to remove sweat from gym. Goes on whatever gaming platform my brother is not on. Actually have some fun in the day and for once out of all 6 hours of school and constant anxiety. And them remembers how bad I am at playing my favorite game (Destiny 2) and stops playing and watches videos on YouTube.

Parents come home: Stops playing and says hello. Dad is usually in the middle of saying how stupid someone was in court and mom quietly listens.

Bed: I do the usual bed time ritual of anybody (brush teeth, wash face etc.) i grab my stank ass Blackberry 10 passport and lays in bed untill 1:00 PM until I faint or realizes that i'm basically killing myself and should go to sleep.


Rinse, Repeat until Saturday. I just play games and do chores like a normal teenage kid. Sunday I go to church to keep up my act of being a Christian so my mom doesn't lose her sweet litte mind.

About my friends: like I said their nice people but homophobic and mock lgtbq people. ""The boys"" mock people that are against thier views and make God awful jokes and grab eachother asses and make sarcastic gay comments and terrible shit in general i'm pretty sure one of the boys is a Nazi. He litteraly thinks that Nazi Germany is good not an edgy joke. And two freinds are a part of ""The Boys"" and follow the same footprints of the little group they have.

It's so much shit and I just need someone to talk too about it.

TLDR: geek that's bi and has autism rants about his life.

I just need a hug."
1029,How do I convince my father who has given up on me that I can go far in my life?,"Ever since I started high school, I've been in depression due to the sheer academic pressure(I go to a highly competitive high school, that stuff causes suicides in the area every year) and due to a family loss. My grades haven't been good because of this. I haven't given up however, and I will try to continue working hard to get better grades and do more work. I won't give up or back down just yet. My father is usually quite soft-spoken and doesn't say anything to me, so I never know what is on his mind. But my mom revealed to me that my father encourages me to talk to my cousins(who are not very good people, they are misogynistic and have been terrible to me, because I am a girl) because he believes that I cannot do anything in my life because of my grades. It absolutely broke my heart to hear that. My dad usually tells me to think small whenever I think about a big achievement. He says that I need to achieve step-by-step, instead of jumping ahead and falling. I used to think he would say that so I would set my sights on improving my foundations, but I guess he has given up on me, and thinks that I will always fall face first in anything I do. I love my dad so much. He has worked so hard for our family. We've not seen him for important milestones in our lives because he is busy working to support us. I cannot stop feeling angry and spiteful with my dad, or with myself. I can't stop crying about the hurt and pain I might have caused him. I cannot stop feeling sad that my father does not believe in me anymore. I feel like a worthless piece of shit. I have no place in the world. The amount of bullying I already face from the world is astronomical. From comments on my looks, to my intelligence, personality, even my smile, I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. When people make fun of my looks, my mom never defends me. She just silently turns around and tells me that I am ugly. She tells me I am dumb. I am not dumb. Not once has my mom not criticized me. Not once has she commented anything nice about my achievements. Everytime I get something, there is negative connotation to it. My father is the same way. I don't know what to do. One moment, my parents are my all and the most loving people to me. The next moment, they make me feel as if I should just kill myself, or remind me of my worthlessness. I don't know who to talk to anymore. I called a hotline and they said ""it will get better"", and that ""they are sorry to hear that"". They don't know that my life has always been like this. It's always been bad. It's just that the years have caught up to me. I don't know where to go. If I tell friends, they will tell on me in school and my parents will get to know of my thoughts. That won't end well for me."
1030,I have a very hard time remembering anything I do,I don’t have memory at least that’s what I think of it as. I barely can remember anything I have ever done even through out today or any other day and I have zero clue why. I have tried to find out some reasons but all of the articles I have read don’t seem to fit what I am going through. I don’t know what to do.
1031,Friend was triggered and relapsed into self-harm.,"They texted me saying “I fucked up” and a picture of a self-inflicted leg wound that they had to get 15 stitches for. Won’t answer any calls, and now only responding with yes or no and “I’m sorry to involve you.”

They’re over 3 years sober from alcohol, but have been known to self-harm in the past (not sure how recently). Struggled with bulimia and other substance abuse issues, but have really been thriving for the past few years. 

I don’t know what to say. They said they were still sober, but I’m not sure if I believe that. They said the injury was from a week ago, but I can’t know for sure. Surely they were looking for support by letting me know, but now they’re shutting me out. I don’t know what to do."
1032,I think i’m a Maladaptive Daydreamer,"Whenever I meet someone new or create a new connection with someone, they become characters in my head and I act out as if it’s happening irl. I can walk around my living room in circles for several minutes/hours just living in a dream world. i’ll be talking to myself but as soon as i hear someone coming i automatically just go sit down and act like I was just chilling. it distracts me from pretty much completing anything during my day and i push away anything i need to be done for later in the day so i can make time to daydream. it’s affecting my school work heavily and i don’t know what to do about it."
1033,stupid ass alarm, Fire alarm just went off... Panic attack... false alarm... Yet a strange smell...
1034,came back to california for bro’s bday. my depression and anxiety is at it’s peak,"I love seeing my friends and my brother after not seeing them since I moved out of this awful state but my god. I will never come here again. The experience I’ve had with California has been nothing short of a nightmare, not to mention Covid makes this shit so much more worse because I’m incredibly high risk and terrified. As soon as I stepped foot on this soil all of my past trauma and depression, whatever you wanna fucking call it, came back to me like it had never left, like it was just waiting for me to come back to absorb it all again. The neighbors and the atmosphere are both so toxic. I miss my home and I want to go back so bad. I can’t because I have to wait another day to drive back. I feel like a prisoner here. I sound like I’m bitch made but if someone wants to talk about video games or anything that would be cool."
1035,I daydream for hours at a time and always find myself pacing.,"I’m not sure what’s wrong with me. I don’t have anxiety beyond what’s sometimes normal nervousness, and I’m not depressed. I disassociate at least everyday. It’s always a glance in a mirror that turns into hours staring at myself not in vain but wondering how my mind is trapped in my body and I’m not dreaming it’s actually real. Sometimes it’s driving to my boyfriends house and telling myself I don’t belong there he doesn’t want me when I just got invited over. 
Then it’s the pacing. I could walk from the kitchen to the living room and back for literal hours. I just dream up scenarios in my head where I’m more liked or more important than I really am and then it makes me disassociate even worse. 
Is this a real problem? I can’t remember not being like this. How do I make myself stop in the short term and the long term? Is it just my inner dialogue?"
1036,Sensations.,Hi. 27(m) I've been diagnosed with PTSD GAD OCD and depression about 5 years ago. I haven't taken antidepressants in a year due to the additive nature of my family. I have seen many friends and family die of overdoses. I live sober and clean as possible. Yet I have a deathly fear of being drugged. I haven't eaten out in years. Even packaged food at the store can give me severe panic attacks. I have noticed lately I have not been able to get outside of my thoughts and mind which is causing me greater anxiety to the point of vomiting and shaking. The back of my head tingles and burns and with intensity can lead to worse panic. When it dies down my anxiety is pretty manageable but I never know how to stop it from coming and going. Could it be a blood pressure or nerve pain thing?  I'm trying to get this under control before I return to work so I dont have an attack and be embarrassed plus I've never heard anyone say theh love anxiety. Very physical symptoms and fear of being drugged or under the influence. Im.thinking on going back to the antidepressants just for some relief even if it's not a lot. I used to drink heavily about 5 years ago which caused a lot of my mental illness but would not like to end up dead. advice would be helpful. Any information about my constant head tingles and headaches. And fear of being drugged?  Please
1037,Fell back down again,Mentally I was doing okay and now I feel like I’m drowning and sinking further and further into the ocean. I can scream but no one can hear me. No one can help. I think emotionally I’m just shutting off again.
1038,17 with declining mental health. Parents won’t allow me to get help because of religious reasons.,"I’m 17 years old and just graduated highschool.
My parents are Catholics who are firm believers of Christ. Me - not so much.

As a child I was super extroverted and outgoing. I said whatever was on my mind and didn’t have any issues making friends. But as I grew into my teenage years, I began to realise the consequences of my actions, and that maybe I’m not as great as I thought I was.

Now I’m extremely introverted, and the thought of socialising terrifies me. Several situations that include talking to strangers (even relatives) and stepping out of my comfort zone have caused and triggered many negative effects on my body and mental health. (excessive crying, panic, shortness of breathe and light headedness. sometimes i get a really bad stomachache and need to use the bathroom)

One time I had a complete breakdown because I had to go to school on my own (an unfamiliar environment) because of my fear of getting lost, making a fool out of myself and the other students judging me.

As a result, I’ve avoided many events and situations in fear of triggering this feeling in me. (which has also caused some people to dislike me because they think that I don’t care about anything or can’t be bothered) I’m too scared to tell them the truth cause I don’t want to use these experiences as an excuse for what I’ve done. I also tend to over-procrastinate, lose sense of time and occupy myself in activities that bring me comfort to push aside these negative emotions.

On several occassions, I’ve thought of inflicting harm on myself and others because of all the pent up emotions. I don’t know how else to express them. Most of the time, I don’t have even have the chance or privacy to let out my emotions because I still share a room with my mom and dad. (we’re unable to afford a separate room)

This has been an ongoing issue for the past couple years and I never realised how much of an inconvenience it’s been.

I’ve tried talking to my parents about this, but they’ve just been pushing religion in everything, saying stuff like I’m not praying hard enough - or my faith in God has weakened.

I don’t know what to do, or who to seek help from. I feel trapped in the same cycle that’s neverending.

The last thing I want to do right now is self-diagnose, but from doing lots of research into health websites and studies, my experiences seem to display signs of social/separation anxiety and/or ADHD. (?)

I’m sorry if this was messy to read. Please let me know your thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to read this."
1039,can someone help me?,"I feel like total shit everyday, and i know what i have to do to feel better, get better. However, i don't have the motivation to do these things and i don't have the energy either. That makes me feel even more bad about myself. Its like a negative cycle. I was wondering if someone could help me on this. I feel like i'm drifting away from the people close to me."
1040,My medication is really making my life unenjoyable.,"Hi. I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. A year ago I was prescribed Citalopram (Celexa) and I’ve been taking it ever since. At first it really helped me with living a functional life but now idk. I take it before I sleep and the whole day I have 0 anxiety but I’m super depressed. I wanna spend the whole day in bed, I only go out for work, and aside from that I wanna do nothing. Even worse, I never have the energy to reach to anyone, the medication makes me isolate myself. And ofc, I’m never hungry or thirsty. Even the things that I usually like aren’t interesting anymore. What do y’all think I should do? Should I try for a new medication? Or should I just stay on it. Lmk what y’all think, I’m down to discuss this."
1041,Why do I get so tired so easily? And what can I do about it? Please help! I'm desperate!,"24 F. I've been diagnosed with depression, generalised anxiety, ADHD and autism. I take fluoxetine (Prozac) , quetiapine (seroquel), Ritalin, and also rabeprazole for reflux.

Basically, life is exhausting. I get into these periods of weeks or months of being too tired to do anything. I sleep a whole lot more (up to 14 hours a night if I don't set an alarm), I fall behind in uni, I cancel all my shifts at work, I go a week between showers, sometimes I'm too tired to bother eating. But I don't think it's depression, because I know what a depressive episode feels like and that's different. There's no emotional component to this tiredness, I don't feel particularly sad or down, and I don't seem to be having more negative thoughts. I'm a bit frustrated when it happens, because I tell myself every night I'll do better then next day and then I inevitably spend the majority of the day in bed, but I don't think it's unreasonable to be frustrated. 

I guess it's triggered by stress, because I'm just coming out the other side of one that's lasted the last two months, and just before I had a friend visit from interstate for a week and a half, and I was stressing about Christmas. But it also seems to be caused by this that should be really benign, that everyone else seems to handle fine: working more than one shift a week, taking more than one subject at uni at a time, visiting my mum in the next city over. Normal people work full time, or study full time; it shouldn't be this hard. I feel so guilty about how my life is a lot less work than my parents or other people I know and that I still have the audacity to feel exhausted and overwhelmed.

I feel really guilty about this, but it seems like my Ritalin helps. It sort of wakes me up a bit and gives me a bit more energy. Not like a lot, but it makes me feel bad about taking it if it's having a stimulant effect, because it's for ADHD, not to give me an energy boost.

There's so many things that could be going on that I have no idea how to fix this. Is my anxiety tiring me out? Is shutting down just my response to stress? Is it a depressive episode after all? Am I malnourished - I get vitamin deficiencies a lot? Do I just need to exercise? Is it a willpower thing, and I'm just doing it because spending all day on my phone in bed is preferable to getting up? Is ADHD or autism making life more difficult for me than for other people? Do I just have weirdly low energy reserves? Do I need to push through and build up my tolerance for these tiring things? Or do I need to take it easier, reduce my commitments when they get too much?"
1042,"Someone told me once that crying is good for your skin, so why do I still have such bad acne?","Just trying to laugh at myself and make the situation less serious. I’ve been crying so much, like at least once everyday, sometimes more. I’m also in the middle of an awful breakout, so I guess whoever told me tears were good for my skin lied to me lol"
1043,How do I love myself?,"So basically I don't like myself, what should I do?"
1044,D.I.D (dissociative identity disorder),"Does anybody know anything beyond the realm of google about dissociative identity disorder? I have not felt myself for a while now and recently its been getting really bad. Ive googled “symptoms” but who doesnt google their symptoms. Of everything i read about the majority of ID disorders it seems that D.I.D is what ive been experiencing. Lost time, doing things i dont normally do or wouldnt do, not remembering things, feeling like nothing is real, ive been unable to decipher real and imaginary lately. My girlfriend of 2 years just left me while pregnant with our second child because of something i did that i dont remember doing or even have any clue why i would do it to begin with. I could really use some more insight on this..."
1045,The best thing I did for myself today is clean.,"Hi, dark lord of the sith here (M29). Today, I'm celebrating something and decided the best thing I can give myself is a clean bathroom and a good meal. 

The past year has been tough on my mental health, especially struggling with substance abuse. I'm trying to be better and these are just a few small steps on getting ""there"" one day. 

To everyone else struggling today, I only wish you love and balance &lt;3"
1046,My therapist appeared to be drunk during my session,"Today  I told my therapist that I'm feeling I'm suicidal bc of Covid isolation  and financial problems, and he responded by drinking straight out of a  of a bottle of wine on camera, and eating cookies. He seemed possibly  drunk and kept forgetting what he was saying mid sentence.  I didn't  know what to say so I told him I thought I was tired of his attitude and  that maybe we should meet less often, he didn't seem to care. I was too  passive; I feel I should have probably just confronted him more  directly, but honestly I'm not in a good space to be confront my  therapist right now!

For months  I've been noticing that my therapist hasn't been on top of things,  increasingly phoning-in our sessions. He says he's sorry a lot, and has  no consistent plan for our sessions. He's missed sessions before because  of ""helping a hung over roommate"".

I  don't know how I should respond. I get this services free through low  income county assistance, so no cost to me. I think I should stop seeing  him, but I'm on the fence about reporting him to his boss."
1047,The delusion of seeking self-control trough self-destruction,"I have used self-harm in one way or another since I was a child in order to self-enforce consequences for my actions because I felt like my environment was too lenient and I made a video where I explain in further detail the justification and why I no longer agree with it. It would be cool if you watched it:

1048,I am experiencing panic attacks and I recognised them only with the third one,"Sunday was a good day. I met my friends and then I shopped in a store (something I almost never do). I am overweight, obese. Normal denim sizes don't fit me. When I tried a size which I thought would fit, and it didn't, I felt a bit low. Primary reason why I never shop in stores. I get overwhelmed. Recently when I shared this with my folks, they said I am mad. Also, that it is an anti-social behaviour and I need to change it. I didn't argue with them because I felt they are not from a generation who would understand that this can be a real thing - feeling overwhelmed and anxious in a store.

Anyway, I was low and I guess my friend detected the mood shift in me. She was kind to console me through it on way back home. Yet I guess the feelings never did resolve. It doesn't go away in a moment - feeling low. I thought that I will be fine the next day. Post dinner when I went to sleep, my heart started racing, and I started feeling hot. My heart raced like anything. I felt as if it would jump out of my chest. I thought may be it is the reaction of me overthinking. However, I wasn't able to understand why I was feeling hot and restless. I knew that I didn't have fever. My heart was pounding incessantly and it just didn't slow down. I felt uneasy and started to walk around the house, drink water, wash my face and chest. Nothing happened. This lasted for almost 2.5 hours.

Next day I spoke about it to my friend (doctor) and she said that this was a panic attack and asked me have I had similar experiences before. In the last few months since August 2020 - 2 more times. My heart beat was so fast around those times that I felt I might get a heart attack soon or might even die. I had not thought over them as much considering them to be isolated anomalies due to a sedentary lifestyle. But, yesterday my worst fears were confirmed. There's something wrong. And this wrong is no more a mild, regular, everyday thing.

I am facing difficulty in coming to terms with it. I want to talk about it but I am scared that people might think that I am saying all this to gain sympathy or they might dismiss it or say that it was not what I think it was. It's not that they are not supportive. They are. I have many people who are extremely supportive. But still I am so hesitant to talk about this to them. I feel it would be too attention seeking if I do that. I feel like flawed person, like a burden on my partner. I don't want to burden him with such negative talks.

I wanted to word all of this out to people who don't know me. That is why I am writing here. I don't know what I seek. I feel low and clueless. 🥺"
1049,I'm venting here just because,"I've developed very bad insomnia. It's 3:42 am right now and I have to be up for the day at 6:30. I care for 6 of my siblings and keep the household running and lately, because I'm so tired, I've been forgetting things and zoning out while I'm cooking or supposed to be doing something. My grades randomly drop at times and then I have to rush to raise them again. It's stressful...

Yeah, that's it. The rest of my shit stays in my head--this us more like a vent of my observations."
1050,Went to my first therapy session.,"I have been diagnosed with depression and was in therapy for about 2-3 months but it wasn't working out well and they gave me a break for a month, but I got worse. I got really disappointed and didn't wanna try to heal anymore, but my psychiatrist recommended another psychologist for me and I had my first session and it went really well, I felt much better and he addressed all my thoughts and asked how I'd like to go through everything and even told me to be completely open and told me on how the therapy would go forward and even let me choose how I'd wanna work through it and appreciated the tiny things i did to improve myself. I really felt like I was finally understood by another person other than my psychiatrist and also my family and it feels really good and gives me more hope in this healing process :) 🖤"
1051,Negative self view,"I think abt myself so low, like the way I view myself compared to others is really bad and I don’t know why. 
I always have negative self talk and view myself as annoying and unattractive and just a bother."
1052,My looks make me suicidal,"Everytime i see my naked body in the mirror, i contemplate suicide. All i think about is the way i look and its exhausting. I am engaged and i can't even get naked in front of my fiance. 
I feel so hopeless knowing the only way to fix my body is with plastic surgery(i will never be able to afford that)
I just wish i didn't look the way i do."
1053,I don't wanna be woken up like this..,"Its 10am and my mother rushed into my toom and screamed at me. Telling me ""YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING YESTERDAY! NOW GET OUT OF BED, SHOWER AND WORK. NO BREAKS GOR TODAY."" 
And ran back out and left to take a walk. 
I don't understand. I don't understand why she would just shout at me. I cooked yesterday, I cleaned the living room, I threw out the Chrisrmas tree thats like two times my size. I did everything she asked me to do. Why is she complaining?
She also wants me to copy 14 pages today and I know I can't do that because my hand will feel like its falling off after just 5 pages. 
I've got holidays?? I'm the only one in my  class that has to do schoolwork thats completely unnecessary. My mother just likes seeing me breakdown and not be able to breathe, doesn't she?!
I hate it. I hate being woken up like that. I hate that i'm crying and breaking down other this. Why am I so weak and never good enough?!"
1054,"Need advice on what could possibly get me out of this rut; depression, sleep issues and sick when I eat.","I normally go through depression swings on a regular cycle and am used to it and eventually dig myself out, but I've never felt so shitty before. Usually my depression has me not eating much, one meal a day or so and no real 'tummy rumbling' or full feelings ever, just all kind of neutral. 

The last two weeks or so I just constantly feel awful. I'm in the depressed state where I can't find the motivation to do anything around the house and I never want to move. I don't work, I'm just finishing some online school but I am SOO behind in class because I can't make myself do any of the work. With covid and no job outside of the house its easy to spend my days doing nothing at all and feeling terrible. 

However that part is a normal depressive slump for me, whats new is I have no appetite then suddenly I'm starving so I eat whatever, then I instantly feel sick. No matter what I eat, whether its pizza or garbage or even if its just toast or tomatoes.  I feel nauseous and then get headaches, get hot and feverish almost like I'm sick with the flu or something. 

And this has just been happening every day, not to mention I CANNOT for the life of me figure out a sleep schedule. Sometimes I sleep all day because I'm depressed or I feel sick, but then when I'm awake I have headaches and feel sick so I don't want to do anything but go back to sleep. But then I can't tell if I have headaches from sleeping too long, or from staying up all night and I'm just at my wits end and I don't know how to fix it.

I have tried for years to get a sleep schedule. I've read books about the science behind it and I just can't help it. Now that I'm home all the time I feel addicted to sleeping. Even if i get up and do one thing, i immediately just want to go to sleep after and try again tomorrow. 

Now with the eating issues, I just have no desire to eat anything because either I have no appetite or the thought of eating makes me sick. Today I've just had saltines and ginger ale and I did ok but I'm sick of feeling faint, weak, light-headed and nauseous. I have SO much I need to get done and I know it in my head and I have motivation, ideas, and drive in my head, but when it comes to moving I just can't make the same signals reach my body. 

I'm doing a big move soon, so I know I have tons I need to do for that too, and I plan on getting a new therapist once I move. I have tried a few here and have not made any decent progress. I do take antidepressants. I most likely am not actually sick, I already had covid like 3 months ago so I don't think I actually have a virus or anything.

1055,Will a therapist inform the police if you tell them about violent thoughts?,"Throw away account because I don't want these words and thoughts tied to my name.

Recently I've been having violent thoughts whether it be towards myself or someone who I hate immensely but never towards any general person.

If I were to tell a therapist about this would they get the police on me? I know it's not right and that I need help but don't know how therapists work."
1056,I wrote this a while ago and it genuinely helped me out of a bad place and I hope it helps others on here,"Understanding that the tightness you feel in the whole of your body is emotions that have been suppressed and its something that needs working on and processing. You make the biggest effort in life to be the person you know you can be. However when you let these unhealthy, toxic and self destructive traits of this energy then flow through your body for long periods of times. They then manifest into something that's impure and Self destructive. The only thing that comes from this is a build up of pain that ends up bursting out in a way that mirrors all these aspects of the things youve pushed away for so long. It's okay to not be yourself. But try your best to not drown in the dread of an idea you've made up yourself that this is how life will be forever. Aspire to be the person you'd want to be. just take it day by day instead of looking at how hard and possibly how daunting the journey might be. You've pushed people away and unfortunately that's something you'll have to deal and find peace with. If they can forgive you that's great. However if not just appreciate that you had these special friendships for the time you did. Always stay in that mind set where love, gratitude and care is a primary objective. You know these things are already built into you and are the best aspects of the person you've become. Just apply them  everyday and also keep these things in mind when unwanted emotions take the stage in the front of your thoughts. As hard as it seems, the journey you take through life will have bumps, obstacles and put you in positions you'd rather not be in. When this happens breath and tell yourself that 'whatever is in your way will not be there forever'. Take action and do all you can to take control. apply the direction you want to travel in with life. If that be in a sense of career, lifestyle or anything you choose to put your mind to. If we've come this far. We can see it through. Love everything you can. The things that you can't justify or understand .... If it be a person an idea or anything you come across are also a part of the world you want to find yourself in. Just be 100% true to yourself and follow your instinct. There will be a time in the future when we look back and realise it was all a test to shape us in the person we was always desting to to be. Learn to love yourself! Then maybe finding love in new people or places won't be such an exhauusting experience for you. Maybe then you'll find peace with alot of the things in your life you hurt or worry about. Peace is on its way and it is deserved, just prepare yourself to embrace that peace as the person you want to be 

Never forget to love day in day out! 
And also keep all integrity to who you are.
The main goal in any life is to spread love and make life the best you can for every soul you cross even if it's a small kindness."

I've always seen therapy as a waste of time (for myself specifically). Why would I bother some stranger with my problems when I, A. Don't know them or their intentions, and B. Am a natural at self analysis anyway?

I'm fifteen weeks pregnant on a painful break from my SO, with a long history of trauma and built-up depression/anxiety that waxes and wanes frequently, and yesterday I found out I may have been exposed to Covid when I (now) stay with two elderly grandparents.

After one of the worst Decembers of my life since I lost dad 13 years ago, I finally took the opportunity through my insurance to see someone and I'm so glad I did. It's difficult to explain why it's different... After only one session, I'm just so glad to have met her. It's not like I'm 'cured', that would be silly and we have a long road ahead of us. But the relief I feel simply from speaking to someone qualified was so incredibly unexpected.

I can't stress enough, to anyone that feels they need to talk to someone, find a therapist. There are so many resources, and you may not find the right therapist for you right away, but please keep trying. Your friends, your family; they mean well and I'm sure they'll help you, but they may not know the BEST WAY to help you. So, please, try therapy once. Take that leap. Don't listen to the anxiety telling you repeatedly to hit the 'cancel visit' button. Just swallow it and do it."
1059,My older brother made fun of me for cutting myself.,"My brother is 18 years old and I'm 16. He knows I was in a mental hospital for a week and visited me there. I was diagnosed with depression and I had to stay there against my will. I took anti depressants two times a day and tried to hang myself twice. The reason for me being in the hospital was physically and verbal abuse from 99% of my family. Most of which was from my father, brother and grandmother. My father stopped abusing me after the diagnosis. A year passed and I felt better but my brother said that he understood how I felt because he started feeling the same way. He thought that no one understood him. I did my best to help him but that same month we had an argument. He started yelling at me, made fun of me and did a motion of cutting his wrists and saying in an exaggerated voice ""Nobody understands me."" I started sobbing uncontrollably and ran into my room. I never forgave him but my family did in seconds. Nobody even cared. I get sudden urges to kill him. He makes fun of my and I cry and become aggressive, not because he hurt my feelings but because I'm trying to calm down and not do something that I will regret. I want to end him, my whole family and the people who wronged me. From a young age I liked to see animals and people suffer. I am afraid of myself and I don't know what should I do. I'm not afraid of ending them but I am afraid of getting caught."

1061,I need help finding a way to get help or something,"This hard to expain and I'll do a bad job. I'm not sure if I can answer questions and if anybody has them or if how I remember things is exactly how things happened. I've never talked about it in a real way to anyone ever. 

When I was in high school I got caught smoking pot by the police. I ended up on probation and didn't smoke while on but failed a drug test (my whole family smoked pot I would have had to sit outside to avoid it.) I tried to tell my probation officer (who worked at and with my school) that I wasn't smoking and he wasn't having it and said I was going to go to jail.

My mom's boyfriend used to be a mental professional. With the intention of keeping me from jail he talked to me about going to a mental hospital. He told me how to act and what to say almost exactly.  I ended up being admitted for depression and self harm. At avoiding going to jail... 

Woooo no jail warm bed funny crazy people I'm living it up. 

My mom and her system savy boyfriend talked to my probation office and hired a lawyer. Them they was some kind of hearing. My failed drug test was attributed to a failed  attempt on my own life that I was currently revising treatment for or something like that... I couldn't believe they bought it cuz it was for weed.

Things seemed okay.  No jail and the therapist I had I felt like I connected with (I was wrong keep reading.) I was hospitalized for about two months. Because my probation officer worked at my school and this shit had the court involved some of my teachers knew I was there. My probation offer and the school wanted me to sign a release of information for them but I refused many times.

 I went to an alternative high school. I had some cool teachers that really went the extra mile sometimes in good and bad ways.  I'd contacted some of them while there just to talk and one even visited me. Overall that experience was a win I think, as strange as it was. I got put on some medication i think helped me and was looking forward to getting back to life. 

I was released and went home. It was a friday and my mom said i could dick off cuz it was later midday. I left my house and went to school. I missed my friends and had great new stories. While bebopin' around school my probation officer sees my and flags me down and asks me what I'm doing. I give her the skinny midday release mom cut me loose  I came to hang out. She starts talking to me about truancy and says i have another probation violation and she is going to have to arrest me when she sees me Monday and that I need to figure this out. Like a head up. Apparently the school told the courts they didn't now where I was cuz I didn't sigh  that release... even though teachers can and visited me.

I think if I'd done nothing the situation would have resolved itself... that hurts alot...

I'm freaking out. I go home. I didn't live far and cell phones went as prevalent. I call my mom and leave her a message. I call her boyfriend leave a message. I call my therapist from the hospital and get her on the phone. I'm trying to explain this crap to her and she's not getting it. Im getting frustrated. I'm on the phone with her maybe five minutes. I'm in my basement room on a cordless with the base at the far end of the house on the floor above. The phone reception was bad...out of frustration I told her I wanted to squish her head (you know close one eye and use your thumb and forefinger to squish) and hung up.

Fifteen minutes later I come up stairs. My mom got home I guess she was on her way. I'm telling her what happened and there's a knock on the door out my kitchen window I see police cars... lots of them no light no sirens. I open the door and it's my school  resource officers they say they need to talk to me. My mom standing a step behind me asks them why and tell me to go to my room which I do. From my wierd uphigh basement window I'm watching the now shin guarded shins of many police gather my front yard.

I see my mom's boyfriend pull up confused and angry. I couldn't tell what he was saying but they were listening.  I see my mom taking to the school offices and then to her boyfriend then she comes inside.

  I go to talk to her about what the hell is going. She's telling me that there was a death threat at the school and that they think I have a gun and that if I don't come out they are coming in for me. She telling me everything is going to be okay. We're I'm my room and I'm shaking but I see some police cars leave. My mom takes my into the living room and her boyfriend is sitting there with this guy who i guess was the chief of police. He explains to me that a teacher call the police and I was flung to be arrested. My moms boyfriend again suggests hospitalization consider my previous visit and called around trying to find my a bed at a hospital. 

They let me pack a bag. I got in a police car and was going to be taken to a hospital while my mom and her boyfriend followed. As we are on our way over the radio I hear them say something about the hospital not accepting people who have charges filed against them. They say to reroute to jail. The police car turns and I hear my mom honking her horn. I turn around and see my mom getting pulled over.

 I'm taken to juvenile detention. I don't know what's going on really.  Nobody talked to me about anything for maybe a week. My mom called me but just said things would be okay.

I couple weeks later. I lawyer came and talked to me. She told me I was going to court and not to say anything at all unless asked. That's when I learn I was looking at twenty years for felony harassment some weird gun charges and all this other shit. She didn't seem worried but I was. 

It was hard to keep track or time. I don't know how long it was till my court date. I got beat a couple times and molested while I was in detention. Which makes this all worse but is hardly the problem. 

I went to court. Apparently my therapist thought I was on a cell phone across the street from the school with a shot gun. When I hung up on her saying I wanted to squish her head she thought I said I wanted her dead. She tried to call back and nobody answered (the cordless phone wouldn't receive calling my room. I could answer and walk in there but it wouldn't ring.) Then she called the police, my school and a teacher that visited me. The teacher that visited me also called the police.  When they figure out how many people where in involved and what really happened.  Everybody the prosecutor included said this was handled awfully. Somebody called it a tragic game of telephone.

I ended up being charged with a misdemeanor harassment and losing my right to bear arms and being beaten and raped. I was released for after fourteen months into the custody of my uncle who lived in town. 

I really need help dealing with this and a lot of other stuff.

I don't trust the people I need help from. Because of this.  

More recently I lost my job, my house, my things, my girlfriend, my cat. 

I been thinking about hanging myself.  I talk to my mom about it and we decided I should go to the hospital... I told them I was thinking about having myself. They forcefuly removed my clothes and gowned me and left me in a room for two hours.  

When a lady came to talk to me I lied to her.  She asked me what was going on and I told her I was angry at my mom. I told her I was elderly blackmailing her cuz she was going to kick me out. She buys this shit and sets me up with all these intake phone appointments for therapy. which I need and want at least I think if I can do it right? They release me.

The next day I start getting calls. I don't know why but I just start yelling at these people. I can tell they want to help me but I'd just berated them. They're calm and kind and I am neither of this things.  They hang up when they can't take it. I pant heart pounding and cry until the phone rings again.

I think I got five calls like that that day.

That was last week

1062,Help with telling work about my anxiety and panic attacks,"Hello,

The long and short of things is a couple of years ago I was diagnosed with general anxiety and panic attacks mainly stemming from my current job at the time where I would catastrophise about things going wrong to the point of having panic attacks. At the time of diagnosis things were pretty bad but since then I have for the most part been able to manage things, changing jobs really helped. Recently I have been struggling again at my new job and decided I wanted to take a step down at my job to take a bit of pressure off myself. This was 5 months ago and they are still relying on me to my management role and it is just getting to the point where I can see myself spiralling again after a couple of years of progress. At the moment I am on furlough but they have asked me to go back to work to manage the workplace on my own and I feel I just can't do it. A couple of months ago they took on someone new to replace my job roll but as they are new they won't let him go in instead of me. 

I know if I try and physically talk to my boss I will probably end up crying and flustered and not say everything as I would have wanted so I am thinking about writing out an email but every draft I make just makes me sound like a whining brat who doesn't want to do any work and I am struggling to know how to start off the email and how much or little information to share. I was wondering is someone may be able to share some advise? I know it's probably a lot to ask but if someone had any sort of templates for this email I would appreciate this. 

Thanks in advance."

For my whole life I’ve struggled with anxiety but never anger. I’m not sure if it’s the culmination of this year but I’ve had several extreme outbursts in public. I’m not a physically violent person, in 90% of cases I deal with adversity very well but recently I’ve noticed this seething rage at people who are exceptionally inconsiderate. I had an outburst a few months back where I absolutely exploded at a mother who refused to remove her kids who were playing in my truck bed in a parking lot despite legitimately polite requests. I also right before Christmas got pressured to take my mask off in a store by a anti mask couple who were trolling the store to which I had another embarrassing explosion on. I’m not someone who has ever had issues with this before in my life. I hate it. This isn’t who I want to be. It’s not who I am or who I was for almost all my life. I’m sick of it."
1065,New research shows online dating can cultivate a rejection mindset,"New research shows online dating can cultivate a rejection mindset

A group of psychologists in the Netherlands have discovered that we have a tendency to gradually close ourselves off when dating online. In other words, the more dating profiles people see, the more likely they are to reject them.

The findings, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science, indicate that the seemingly endless stream of options can increase feelings of dissatisfaction and pessimism about finding a partner, which in turn leads to rejecting potential mates.

“We know that being and feeling loved is a prerequisite for a happy life, and I’ve therefore always been fascinated by the ways in which people look for love,” said study author Tila Pronk, an assistant professor of social psychology at Tilburg University.

The researchers found that the acceptance rate decreased over the course of the online dating procedure in all three studies. The last study provided some clues as to why: participants reported a decreasing satisfaction with the pictures over time and an increasing pessimism about being accepted themselves, which in turn was associated with the tendency to reject.

“The continued access to an almost limitless pool of potential partners when online dating has negative side effects: it makes people more pessimistic and rejecting,” Pronk told PsyPost. “We coined this phenomenon the ‘rejection mindset.’ The consequence of the rejection mindset is that over time, people ‘close off’ from mating opportunities when online dating.”

This rejection mindset appeared to be particularly strong among women, “the gender that is already much less likely to accept potential partners to begin with,” the researchers said. “As a consequence, the initial benefit women have in their likelihood of having a match dissolved in the process of online dating.”

“Dating is not the only domain in life in which choice options have vastly expanded,” Pronk explained."

1069,Am I losing empathy?,"  

for a while I've been worried that I'm losing my sense of empathy or that I am lacking one and I never notice. Over the last couple of months, a famous YouTuber/streamer got caught up in a big sex scandal. to put it simply he used his twitch funs that was supposed to go to his kid college fund to go meet up with fans and have s\*x with them. Some of them some of them being 17 and thus underage he also seemed to have a habit of taking of condoms without consent. all and all a shitty person. Now the problem I'm facing is that I'm not mad at this person ..at least I don't ‘think I am I'm mad at what he did and I was sad when I heard the news come out. all over Twitter people were calling this person out saying ""f\*ck him"" and ""he should go die"" but I just feel numb about the situation. The only thing I could really say about my feeling is that wished the situation didn't happen I wish the YouTuber hadn't done these things and I’m sad these things happen to the girls but I don't feel anything much more than that. Now recently the YouTuber sent a message on his twitch saying that he been to therapy and that he is thinking of coming back. Now this action has brought Twitter to an uproar and has brought more victim stories to light. Now the problem I’m worried about is that if this person does come back, I would watch their videos and laugh at their jokes. During the sex scandal situation, I would still watch their videos on YouTube they were and still are a funny person to me I still like their content even though I know what they have done. does that mean I’m lacking empathy? This person did horrible things to women betrayed his fans, his Coe workers, and his family but I can't find it in myself to hate him just what he did. I don’t blame the victims or anything like that and I feel sad for them but not like how everyone else online seems to feel for them."
1070,Help figuring out some wild symptoms,"When I was a child, I would have these scary dreams where time and space dilated so that I would have to walk though a maze for what felt like thousands of years in the dream, or watch a wrecking ball inch closer and closer to a wall without ever hitting it. Other times I would see a sphere grow infinetly large and it felt like I was forced to fully perceive the size of the sun. 

I would know when these dreams were going to happen because I would have an impending sense of doom and beginning time/space dilation before I fell asleep while lying down.

Since then I have very rarely had the dreams again, maybe once a year. Again I get the sense of doom every time before it happens, always in bed.

However, just 30 minutes ago I had the exact sensation happen to me while AWAKE lying in bed for what just felt like 30 minutes but was only like 5 minutes.

Objects close to me were unbelievably large, my phone next to my head looked like I could stand atop it, while my door across the room looked the size of my fingernail. Everything was going super slowly like my brain was thinking a million times faster than possible. If I tried to look at a timer on my phone however, it looked like seconds went by like milliseconds, the timer was blazing fast.

I always thought this was just some weird dreams but now I'm pretty concerned, during the what was only ~5 minutes it felt like I had literally gone insane, or like someone dosed me with lsd.

Anybody know wtf just happened? These sensations are not new to me, but normally only asleep.

 I also have a lot of ADHD symptoms like hyperfocus and no ability to focus on what does not interest me. Dunno if those are related."

1073,My life is not moving on but my loved ones' lives are. Am I dragging them down or being selfish or both? Or should I distance myself from them? What should I do to not make them feel unwanted by me but also give them space for their lives?,"A little about me. I am 20 years old. I was diagnosed with autism and adhd at 2, gods know why. My joint ""family"" was terribly abusive. From physical, social, emotional, sexual and mental abuse, they left no stone unturned. Pushing me off the stairs, throwing me in deep enough ponds, molesting, lying to people about me etc etc for years. 
Over the years, my autism and ADHD got more friends with depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia, SPD, DID (10 of us😁), Bipolar &amp; based on common symptoms PPD, CPTSD.....
I'm no expert but my therapist has an extensive knowledge and experience over it due to this. 

When my parents got separated from those people, they still kept up with abuse. What I have told me parents is merely scratching the surface of what is the truth. 
But, I had my parents (overweight, diabetic, suffering from heart disease), 4 older cousins (who're all older by at least 10 years), my therapist (who is a friend of one of those cousins and became a psychiatrist because she saw me since my infancy) and an online best friend who is nothing less than a little sister to me and we're soulmates.

Alright so over 18 years, I have become really damaged. I wanted to commit suicide each minute because of each second's hell. My parents were with me and cousins too and therapist but there's a place outside home too.....
They do all they can but school, society..... I'm from a place where mentally ill cause fear or deep hatred. My cousins and therapist are no less than parental figures towards me. It is because of them I still had some amount of hope towards normal people being kind and understanding. 
I have extremely good drawing skills, painting skills, I work really hard (need to as I am stupid), I'm in my sophomore year of mechanical engineering, keep in top of my class of 1-6 positions. I am skilled at coding and programming because my cousins taught me (it helped focus) and basically an otaku (weeb). I have a lot of knowledge about a lot of things. Sometimes adult things too but eh.
Don't judge but I kind of need to take 6-9 medicines. 

 But by 14 yrs of age, I got addicted to cough syrup and painkillers to let me sleep and not feel arthritis and scoliosis and obesity. But I willed myself off of those as a certain movie in 2016 inspired me to hold on, train my body and be a little selfish. So I physically trained and got really strong and fit, felt suicidal but still went on due to being too afraid of dying.  Then after a year and a half in 2018, I found my first friend, my best friend on Instagram. Let's call her L, though she deserves all W. She just turned 17 last week. She lives in a place 4.5 hrs behind my time.
I don't know if it is okay to share it but she'd been harming herself due to bullying and had been suicidal for long. But she showed me extreme kindness, love and care for no reason. I definitely reciprocated but I don't know if I ever did enough or close. And not only for her but for others too😕.
Now she has recovered tremendously, helped me tremendously too. Progressed, grown and developed amazingly. She is still going on, but it's incredible nonetheless.

Now fast forward to now:
My parents are in and out of hospital, have stress due to family feuds with their parents and siblings. They travel at work to keep the funds coming for my college, therapies, medicines and all. They've been doing so since 2017 and since then I live alone. It's more difficult for them than me.

All my cousins have gotten married, their spouses are loving towards me but I cannot in my right conscience rely on them because they have started a life.

My therapist too has gotten married, I cannot keep calling her in the middle of the night or else it might just cause disturbance in her personal life.

My best friend got stronger and is now healthily dating a presumably good guy and intends to make it last very long. I pray it goes for lifetime settlement. 


So you see. I have reduced my calls to my parents from 7-9 of a minute or so in a day to 1-2 calls of a couple of minutes because they are working, have dozens of people on call and need to file in a lot papers and presentation.

I have reduced my texts, calls to cousins from 10-12 times a day (all cousins combined) to 2-3 at best in a day. That too just memes or just random how are you.
They return it well too but I leave them on read because I don't want to drag on to a pointless conversation

I call my therapist only once a week (30-90 minutes) from  everyday. I mostly ask her how is her life first so that she doesn't feel like she's only a therapist for me. She is always talking about and to me but eventually things are over to talk about and I tell her I got work to do so that she does not feel uncomfortable with ending the call.

I have reduced my texts to my best friend because she could only message during my late night/her evening. 
Since she's also a student &amp; not working, I'd message goodnight, goodmorning and I love you and proud of you everyday. But lately there'd be 0 notifications in the morning or night meaning she only saw them in her late evening. As I have no one else, only DM I get on Instagram is from her. She has all my contacts means to reach me if needed so I know she's well.
So I have stopped sending her messages unless she sends because she's mostly on call with her lover so I don't want to disturb that. She deserves someone who appreciates her like him. 

But I cannot stop feeling crippled and clingy to them all. I am very alone. I have no friends except her. No family except them. 
But I am 20, both my girlfriends either died or committed suicide years prior.
 I am bi and demisexual but now I am probably leading towards asexuality. 
No matter what or how much I plan for my higher studies, internships, this bloody time won't move on. All the skills, hardwork, none of it helps this. No matter how much I study, train or plan or game, nothing in my life is moving on. 
Each minute is a hell mentally. 
Emotionally too lately, I can't help but feel I've gotten colder towards them but if I reach out to them I feel annoying and a baggage. I have talked to them and they all say that I am good and they're the same.
But I can't help but feel a coldness inside and 1000s of voices that they're not keen on keeping our relations and want to distance from each other. 
I don't know what I am, where I am, how I am....

If you guys don't want to help it's alright. I can understand and see why. But thanks to reddit for helping me vent."

1075,How could I possibly love myself,"

I’m a 36-year-old man. I’m married to my 35-year-old wife and have two daughters (five and two). I am also deeply unhappy and dissatisfied. 

I’m constantly finding myself feeling angry about my life. I compare myself to others, particularly those who once bullied me or who were popular at school. I am intensely jealous of those that are doing better than me. I also feel guilty about this. Both because I’m fortunate in some ways and because I’m fully aware of how juvenile and damaging these emotions are.

My wife and I have been intimate in more than two years. This is partly because anti depressants rob me of my libido, but also because we’ve both gained weight since having our children: I have little energy and find my wife less attractive. Again, I feel guilty about this. It makes me feel shallow and uncaring. It’s gone on for so long that neither of us will initiate it - the thought of doing so makes me very anxious.

I have little contact with others and find spending time with others to be difficult. I often feel inferior to them and am constantly nervous around them as a result. I have a huge ego and like to think I’m special but know I’m not. I suspect I have narcissistic personality disorder. My middling career is a particular source of dissatisfaction. It’s not particularly well-paid or impressive. Neither should matter but I constantly feel down about it nevertheless. I’ve not really progressed professionally in several years.

I smoke cannabis regularly and, sadly this and then eating huge amounts of junk food are the only things I look forward to. I love my daughters, but they’re often such hard work. I’m also a terrible parent.

I don’t have enough money. I’m not comfortable in the company of others but crave their approval. I look forward to nothing but getting stoned and eating. I have diabetes and this is killing me. I am unhappy. I’ve tried CBT, counseling, mindfulness and more. I troll people online because I’m unhappy. I’m a lost cause."
1076,I feel like I'm about to lose it.,"For quite some time now I've been sleeping for most of the time, and when I woke up it was nice and late and no one would ever bother me.
I decided I'd try to make my sleep schedule a bit more normal which obviously means my parents aren't asleep.
But now every single sound is annoying me further and bringing me anxiety. Every single step they take, them opening the drawers, doing stuff, hell even breathing, I can hear it all and each of these sounds makes me anxious. I think I'm afraid that they'll ask me to go help them with something which obviously is a ridiculous think to be scared of but I don't know anymore."
1077,Maybe I should just accept the fact that I'm pathetic and be happy with it.,"I have no talents or skills. Everything I've ever tried to do, I've either failed, given up because it was too hard, or if I still do it, I completely suck at it. 

I am too scared to stick up for myself, so I've let people walk all over me my entire life. I hate saying no to people and worry more about their feeling than my own. 

I'm stuck at a dead end job because I'm too scared to try and go somewhere else for several reasons. I dropped out of college twice because I'm too stupid to learn anything or retain any information that I read, and I have a very difficult time understanding almost anything. 

I'm just a loser."
1078,Can valium stop breathing?,"I'm on 5mg as of tonight and I'm panicking. I read the list of side effects and it says ""seizures"" and ""stopping of breathing"" 

Sometimes in the night on odd occasions I wake up not breathing much at all or gasping. Doesn't happen very often though and this was BEFORE I started valium. 


But now I'm panicing as it says you can die from benzos as it stops you from breathing and all this stuff. 


Will I be okay? How common is it to die from Valium?"
1079,Miscarriages and pnemonia,"Please forgive my incoherent sentences.

Well it's been a difficult past few weeks to say the least. Especially for my mental state.

My Christmas wasn't perfect I guess... I want to be a dad so bad... And I thought it would happen. I am a realest and I know as my wife is 35 the risk is higher and I'm  not blaming her at all but it was a shock to the system when she told me the baby wasn't growing.

She kept showing me the ultrasound photo and I couldn't control my self (I'm a howler) I broke down I crashed on the ground basically causing a flood of tears on the ground.  

It was meant to be a big surprise for my family I was looking forward to showing my kid. He/she would of been awesome. Half white half Japanese... Would of been a star. I want to play games and give it a life of happy carefree memories but not this time. Last night my wife told me her stomach was starting to feel weird which meant it was happening soon naturally and to tell our kid one last goodbye.

I lost it. I cried and touched her stomach and said ""I wanted to met you, I love you, I will always love you"" Im crying now writing this... Need to harden up.


Next woe was I got pnemonia last week's I was worried I had covid. But it was negative but I had a chest x-ray and my lungs were white.

That was fun......


Ok sorry for the long shitty dairy entry.

Have a great day.

Looking forward to positive times....."

I am also hard of hearing, and after struggling to understand her (through a mask) several times, she raised her voice and started talking to me like I was a complete idiot.

1088,I need help,"Hi

Im going to try and make this as short and informative as I possibly can. Im posting this for some advice/support through a complicated ongoing situation.

I sometimes struggle to put my thoughts into words so please bear with me as this is difficult to write.

First off, here's some background.

I'm a male, 22, living in the UK and grew up with a single mum and low wealth.

I've struggled with mental health issues from my early teenage years. These include depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, self-harm and suicidal thoughts irritability, often causing reckless behaviour.

I'm now convinced after doing months of research and experimenting that I could have ADHD and/or Bipolar disorder, and am struggling to get the right support and treatment as the system here is difficult to navigate.

I dropped out of both school and college twice due to issues with hyperactivity, difficulty concentrating and periods of depression, often leading to me staying off for whole weeks. My mother would lie to the school on my behalf to keep me off and allow me to rest. 

My mother didn't like cooperating with healthcare professionals but I believe from applying what I have learned recently (in regards to bipolar and other psychological disorders) to her behavior when she was alive, that she also had bipolar. She never sought help as she was mentally ill and I didn't realise at the time as I was too caught up with my own life. 

In college, I would either stay off for weeks due to a severely depressed mood, or show up with no sleep due to hyperactivity, but I only realised this recently. At the time I put this down to juggling a relationship, job, college and moving away from home, and so did my doctor at the time.

I found it really hard to cope in a classroom environment as the slightest thing could distract me. But I was too scared to speak up about it and just accepted that I had other stresses and that was why. ""Just deal with it"" I thought.

I was in a relationship during my teenage years from the age of 16-20 and my partner would always tell me I was ""fine"" and didn't need to go to the doctor when I had bad thoughts/feelings and would help me through them. I trusted her because I thought she knew everything and always acted like she was correct, even when she wasn't.

These are both traits that were displayed in both my mother and ex partner, making it difficult for me to seek help.

She also convinced me to move across the country so we could be together while she studied. I agreed because that's what kids do when they first find a relationship like that, I had nobody to tell me otherwise and I knew none the better.

This caused many complications.

When we broke up my life spiralled out of control and I turned to drugs and alcohol as an escape to the feelings, and I discovered (recreationally) ketamine.

Ketamine was a problem for me for a while because it made me feel amazing. Not because of the high or some kind of addiction, but if I took it when low I would feel normal FOR WEEKS at a time. This is another thing I noticed from experimentation with myself and reflection on memories from taking it before.

My mother passed away soon after. Of course this was a bad time but I still experienced the highs and the lows, only the lows were much worse.

After staying with distant family for a while when I was grieving, I then decided to get my own place. I moved city, got a job, 

Lockdown happened a month later, and I had a lot of time to focus on things I've never had time to do, learn and really understand.

Staying sober and focusing on myself allowed me to pick up on something:

I started writing down my thoughts and moods to track them. And I notice a pattern with periods of highs and periods of lows, lasting weeks or longer.

After doing extensive research I'm convinced that I have a certain kind of bipolar disorder and also ADHD.

Now instead of staying in my bed for days with lights off when depressed, I've tried microdosing ketamine (illegally)  to relieve the depression symptoms and it really helps. In unimaginable ways. 

Im concerned that I end relying on ketamine on order to feel normal, as it is an illegal substance and not easy to acquire, especially for me as I am not wealthy.

Now, my issue is that the system here is very difficult to navigate, especially during Covid times, and I am struggling with my own thoughts and emotions to the point where I have thought hard about ending things when I'm feeling low.

I've been in contact with the GP and they referred to me a psychologist, who then gave me access to online CBT group classes (which I'm still waiting for) but I haven't spoken to them, the assessment is just going from my medical records and what the doctor has told them based on phone call from myself. I know I will benefit from greatly from CBT but I feel like this is not the right treatment long term.

My concerns are:

I've been on anti-depressants for the past year and I still get depressed, along with the elevated moods and in patterns. Im concerned they either make my brain worse or I get addicted to them.

The system here doesn't work for people like me who dont have the right support. I've seen it first hand. Many people I know either personally or through others have taken their own lives because the system has failed them or they havent had the right guidance and I refuse to be a victim of this.

Will this worsen as I get older?

My questions are:

How the hell do I get all this information through to a doctor so I can get the right treatment? Every time I call I find myself not being able to get any information across as I speak nonsense without realising at times.

How do I go about my life dealing with this? Do I just tell people before I let them into my life I have slight bipolar and ADHD and hope they are understanding?


I have goals, ambitions and talent that I can't nurture due to this. I want to get back into education and get myself a specific degree, even though I have to start from the bottom. I know am not stupid and am capable of doing this but I feel like I've had a broken support system for my entire life and I feel lost.

I really need pointers and advice.

Thank you for your time reading this"
1089,Some advice I Really Hate about dealing with Isolation,"I've been browsing the latest guides on how to deal with isolation due to lockdowns etc, and one thing that comes up again and again is ""stay connected with your friends"", ""talk to someone"", ""reach out"".

So what do you do if all your ""friends"" deserted you sometime last year?  You kept reaching out, kept asking them to meet if possible/make time for a phone call, even just maybe message once a week, and they couldn't even be bothered to do that? And you realised that ultimately, you're just not that important to anyone at all...

What if they didn't even reply to your message on Christmas Day?  Didn't bother sending you a new year message, hell, don't even bother to ask if you're still alive this year when they know you live alone and have had a really shit year on top of Covid and lockdowns.

People I've known for years can't even find the time to spend a minute messaging me, never mind taking the time to do something more substantial.

I wish the authors of these articles would realise that not everyone has 5000 friends they can talk to.

I discovered Reddit at the start of the Lockdown in March 2020, and to be honest it's now the only thing I have which makes me feel like I have any kind of human social connection, so I am grateful at least for that, I just wish people weren't so rubbish at being friends, at least the ones I know, especially the ones who've always gone on about being caring and compassionate and empathic, which rings really hollow when their actions reflect just about the opposite, unless I'm just a really shit person and can't see it 😢"
1090,I have never felt so down in my life,These past 6 months have been horrible but these past few weeks I can barely function. My partner has been dealing with mental health issues such as depression and I never knew how to help him because I was typically always a happy person. One day in August he broke up with me out of nowhere and said he didn’t make me happy and he needed to fix himself first. Not even 2 weeks later things were back to normal and I thought he was just having a bad month. Soon after we decided to get an apartment because we had been dating for 4 years so we thought it was time. Maybe 2 weeks before we moved in I saw he was going downhill again and not being his normal self. I told him that I was nervous and he assured me everything would be great once we are in there. Well not even one month into moving in together he is back to be depressed all the time I would get nervous every time he texted me thinking he would be sad or angry. Then he broke up with one once again. This time is hitting hard. He always leaves to house to hang out with friends or party everyday so I’m always home alone. So now when I’m sad I don’t have my mom or someone at least with me so I always feel lonely. My best friend moved about 8 months ago as well so she is far from me. I can barely eat anything. I always feel nauseous or sick to my stomach. I am weak and just tired all the time. I always feel like I’m going to cry from anger or just pure sadness. I hate feeling like this but it won’t go away. Since I’m always alone I’m starting to think “Would anyone even care if I was gone ? Would they notice..” On Christmas night he left to go to a Christmas party(but I thought he was just going to a friends house). I was sitting home on Christmas all night while he was out partying with girls. How can someone do that to someone they claim they love(d). I found out all this information via Instagram and I had a horrible night that night as well. I started overthinking all the things that happened and sent me into a crying fit for hours. Same thing happened on New Years Day. My anniversary was also on the 27th which he was not home at all for as well. It’s like he doesn’t even care if I’m hurting. How can I still want someone who treats me like this. He left me to the wolves and is enjoying life??? I hate being in that apartment it seems like he wants me to see if happier when he is not in a relationship with me. I can’t go anywhere right now because of COVID so I don’t know what to do. It’s like I’m stuck. I have college classes starting up in 2 weeks and I don’t know how I can even start to do that when I feel this awful. Just coming home from work I feel like I did a marathon. I literally sit at a desk all day but it’s mental and physically exhausting. I don’t know what to do. I hate feeling like this.
1091,Stress,Absolutely everything is stressing me out and I can’t stand being alone with my own thoughts for more than 5 minutes because I keep thinking and thinking and thinking absolute nonsense and it’s not helping me but I can’t stop even time passing by makes me want to cry I don’t want to be left alone
1092,Obsessive thoughts,"I saw a meme where whoever posted it was talking about how ruminating over something they said days ago, like that’s supposed to be ridiculous. It made me think about how I ruminate over things I did or said for years. There have been many times in my life where I just didn’t handle things like I should have, where I was insulted or pushed around and either handled it ineffectively or didn’t do anything whatsoever. I think about these things all the time and go over imaginary scenarios where I did the right thing, as if that’ll fix the problem. But as long as what happened remains unresolved, these thoughts continue to poor into my mind. It goes on so often and I just can’t stand it. The only thing that helps is distraction, but obviously that doesn’t last. I need help because this causes me a lot of agony."
1093,What am I experiencing?,"22M
For the past 3 months I’ve been having weird sensations in my head, feeling of head pressure or dizziness for a split second but they occur many times throughout the day. They’re not really affecting my daily life as I still do things normally, but they’re very scary and annoying, another weird thing is that they mostly disappear if I forget about them. Anyone here experienced similar things? Is it serious? Any reply would be very appreciated"
1094,I hate the feeling of knowing that my own problems are almost entirely my own fault by my own choices.,"I don't understand how it's so easy for some people to just routinely do things. When I work on anything, I do them in bursts and I just cannot spread own thing out over the course of many days because I'll forgot about it and never touch it again. It's so damn hard to do ANYTHING and I don't know how to explain that to people I disappoint again and again. I want to believe that it's to my fault, that my brain probably just works differently from others but I still just can't get the feeling out that even if I can't control my own feelings and emotions, I should be able to do the things I want to. But I can't because I always inevitably end up making the choices that are unproductive and shit and I hate myself for the fact that it's entirely my own fault by my own choices. I tell people that I just can't keep up, but the truth is that I have plenty of fucking time and I know how to plan and I know how to time manage and I literally help everyone else with these problems even though I'm a fucking train wreck myself. I know and have everything I'd need to do what I want to do yet none of my actions reflect a me that is working towards these goals."
1095,Help me please,I need to stop biting my nails! 39f once and for good damnit. I go in waves but yesterday I plowed through them in a flash. Shame.
1096,Did I dissociate last night?,"I know you probably get these all the time so thank you for your patience. In the last few weeks, especially after talking to someone I'm close with who's a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I've realized that I likely have memories I'm not remembering. I remember a handful of small instances of cocsa and one small event with a grown up family friend. But because of other symptoms I have it seems like there's stuff I'm not remembering. 

Last night I was already not feeling good. My chronic pain was acting up and I was struggling with some suicidal intrusive thoughts. We were laying in bed and all of a sudden I thought of something (which I no longer remember what it was. I have this thing where I can temporarily make myself forget what I'm upset about to help me calm down but this time I didn't remember it later) and my anxiety spiked and I started feeling uncomfortable and restless. I felt dizzy and light headed and when I looked at my arm it didn't feel attached to me. Overall I felt really uncomfortable in my body and anxious.... 

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions and I'll try and answer. Thank you again for helping me when I know what I'm going through is nothing compared to a lot of you. 💕"
1097,I dont know what to do,"Things have been rough again I thought I was better but it feels like everytime I ""recover"" I dont actually do that, I've had issues for awhile with depression and im actively going to counseling and trying to take care of myself but each day I cant help but think about ""bad things"" like self harm or more intrusive things I won't describe but I havent given into it in awhile and ive just started healing old wounds.

Besides the general things above that I mentioned I went numb for awhile but more recently I have caught actual feelings which feels good because I missed that but yeah I just dont know what more I can do, I mean I have people in my life I know and I feel selfish for being sad or frustrated all the time, I've had issues with abuse at a young age and I dont wanna become the abuser you know? I just dont know how to handle myself with school,family, and friends-- and my inner thoughts are getting worse but I seriously can't stand it ill go from happy and productive to unmotivated and completely drained which isn't good for anyone but im an artist and I keep stacking up commisions I have no motivation to finish. 

What more can I do? 

--Things I acknowledge I struggle with would be adhd which brings some things up In me especially frustrations, bpd, major depression/depersonalization things and then my counselor had mentioned possible mania but I dont know if this is relevant things mentioned were diagnosed and I am unmedicated because my reaction to meds.--"
1098,Is there a reason one would flip flop between interests/desires?,"I'm 26 and I still don't know what I want to do with my life. I find myself flip flopping between my interests and things I could pursue a career in (Retail is not my lifelong ambition - it's a means to an end).

Typically I feel this happens when I see others doing what I want to do, and I'll get hooked on the idea of something for a short or long time..
I am studying concept art at university and I've felt my interest in it waning - I don't know if this is motivational or my anti depressants screwing with me - but I don't feel like I'm 'hungry enough' for it as most students put it.. Theres a bit of an idealogy that you have to want it so bad that you study day in day out even on a break. I feel I have the skill for it but not the motivation or competitiveness that is very much required to be successful in this field. 
I'm also interested in horses and training them, and want to get involved in that more. I am quite envious of people who have their life in order and know exactly what they are doing - I tend to get wrapped up in my interests or other things that I could do with my life but my mind seems to change all the time.
I do Photography on the side, and it's something I wouldn't mind pursuing professionally as well but it doesn't earn me enough to pay the bills. 
Motivation (or lack thereof) seems to be a factor in all the facets of my life and is a problem I seem to come back to all the time. 

I just want to know if anyone else has ever felt this way, did you seek help? I haven't really gone into it with my psychologist because I've had a whole range of other issues we've been dealing with. I do think it is something I have to bring up."
1099,I think I have ROCD (Relationship Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) if it isn’t that then what?,"(This is a rant/question) Ive been in a few relationships since I was 17, I’m 18 now and just got into a new relationship, I only recently in my 2nd relationship out of 3 (the one I’m in now) realized that there’s something seriously wrong with me, I’ve noticed a chronic issue of what I can only describe as “worrying” in my first relationship it manifested in asking to see ss of DMs and asking lots of questions about why the person wasn’t responding or what they were doing exactly. Then in the second relationship it manifested in checking her snapscore near religiously to the point where I’d take a step back and wonder what the hell I’m doing. I’d also check her map every so often and again ask lots of specific questions to leave no room for grey area and lies. Luckily I had very patient and understanding partners who pardoned my excessive questions and worrying. And I’ve noticed a pattern, compulsions arise I get satisfaction of an answer or a snapscore not changing or something. And then I go on with my life, then I’ll get an intrusive thought, and immediately doubt my partners loyalty or their validity of where they were or what they were doing or if they really love me. Over time as the relationship goes on it tends to increase in severity, with me tending to have several breakdowns in a week. 

I know some symptoms of ROCD have people doubting their partners worth or the worth of the relationship and their partners looks and wealth etc. or if they’re happy in the relationship, I’d say mine is more focused on the persons actions specifically."
1100,Just called the emergency number for suicide prevention,"And they put me on hold!!!! With vivaldi playing!! I was so anxious that I eventually hanged up before anybody answered, but the whole situation is ridiculous and also kinda makes me pissed!! Idk what to do now"
1101,Pulled up to my therapy appointment to find two police SUVs waiting. If they come for me there's gonna be a fight. I'm sitting in the waiting room feeling stupid,Fight.
1102,Please help me identify/ rationalise with this situation,"My extended family is full of elite students, all my cousins are in top schools in the country I'm in. All of them are doing well in their respective elite schools. I am in an elite school too, but am not doing very well. Have had am inferiority complex bc of this (as well as anxiety and other mental issues), also due to the fact that education is a priority in my country. 

The problem I would like to voice out on isn't about me, but rather my little brother. He was unable to get a good enough score on a major standardised test, and was thus unable to enter an elite school like the rest of us did. My mother constantly compares him to us, and always tells him to study and study no matter what he does. However, he clearly has no motivation for it (most 12 year olds don't start studying super hard yet right?? esp before school even started) and my parents have been scolding him for this. They recently banned him from his hobbies and scold him for being very lethargic and looking bored. 

In my opinion, if you take everything someone likes to do away, ofc he'll be bored. For motivation to study, we have to make sure he knows what the end goal is and slowly cultivate his own reason for doing things. However, my parents seem to expect him to pick up his pen and start studying despite him having no desire to do well, which wouldn't work at all. 

He always says there's no point in doing this or that, as well as saying that he has no freedom or that he'll never be able to achieve as much as us. He is very very lethargic at home and seems to have developed a complete avoidance of academic studies.

I somehow think that this is due to the fact that his inferiority complex is so strong that he wants to avoid anything that could be compared as much as possible. I think that he thinks lowly of himself also bc of this reason. And my parents taking away everything from him is driving him into a state of constant sadness. 

I'm very scared that this will result in long term mental issues for him, and would like some advice regarding this matter. Confronting my mom isn't an option as she'll shut me down just bc I'm a 'teenager who doesn't understand anything'"
1103,Ugh life,"I feel like I am losing excitement for life. I still have hope and I'm still functioning (I.e. going to work, talking with friends) but these lockdowns are definitely getting to me. I still feel hope but life feels gray. I'm also a healthcare worker and feel that my work life has just extended outside the hospital walls where everyone wears masks and is vigilant about illness. The new year looks exactly like last year so I miss novelty and excitement about something positive.

Anybody else feel similar? I would love to hear from other healthcare workers too."
1104,My boyfriend is depressed and I don't know how to help him,"My boyfriend (32m) has been recently diagnosed with Asperger. That means that he is not really good with emotions. We've been together for about 4 months now and we know each other since April. Now i see a pattern of his behaviors. He is a great guy, a great partner for a while...then when something doesn't go his way, or a problem appears he starts isolating himself, ignores me, literally he told me he doesn't want to respond to my messages.   He had a fight on Christmas Eve with his father and I think that was what caused his depression. I'm so hurt by his lack of affection or interest of any kind (he even didn't want to celebrate the new year with me) but I'm trying to be there for him, texting, asking how he is doing ect but I'm coming to my limit. I'm trying but I don't know what else I can do except give him time and wait until it passes. But still, we had more downs than ups in this little time we've spent together. Please, can you give me any advice on how I can help him, or any relationship advice? I feel so guilty for being angry and disappointed with him for his behavior.

Ps: i tried talk with him about it but he doesn't want to talk
Ps2: he went to a therapist but said it was useless
Ps3: he stopped saying he loves me or even responding when I say I love him with all my heart. He just said, i know sorry for my mood"
1105,im not sure about my mental health,"  
I'm having problems with my mental health  
I'm currently 14 years old  
in y7, i suffered from depression and low self esteem. I used to be very vindictive of others, but I've fixed that now.   
i recently had more control of how much i hated myself, and for some time I didn't and i practised the self love mindset, but that's gone now  
the good thing is is that I'm not sensitive about my self image now. that's good  
that is because i found a solution to deal with the anger i have with other people: sadistic fantasies  
I'm so tired of hating myself that i have found pleasure in subjecting the people i hate to physical torture  
I've done little research into sadistic personality disorder. I'm a physical and vicarious sadist.(maybe also verbal)  
other forms of sadism exist, such as sexual sadism, but I don't identify as that.  
I have morals, i believe, and I am not interested in harming innocent people, i believe that that is wrong.  
am i a bad person for wanting to hurt those that have wronged me?  
is it bad to use sadistic fantasies as a form of retributive justice?  
so that's the first point.  
i also believe that I might have paranoid personality disorder, but I'm not sure if i am that or if i am just extremely cynical.  
i believe that my cynicism is caused and perpetuated by my low self esteem. I also hold many other people in low self esteem (misanthropy) apart from my best friend, who I care about the most, and would never seriously think of harming. i tick most of the symptoms for ppd, I believe 

i am also questioning if i have schizoid personality disorder. I am very introverted/ antisocial/shy so i feel a tendency towards being alone and i often appear cold to others, even though I might not hate them in particular. I don't have mush desire for emotional intimacy, even with my best friend, there are things i have thought about doing to them that I would never want them to know. I feel more comfortable opening up about myself if I know that no one will know who I am. i often fulfil my desires for social interaction through fantasy relationships, instead of real  


this is bad  


one thing that i do know for sure is that i have depression and suicidal thoughts. i often think about shooting myself with a gun to end my life, but its only ideation for now. I will not take it practically until I'm in my 40s or whatever  


i am aware that i am a minor. maybe this will change, and i will look back on this and feel that i have changed. maybe i will grow up to be a great person who doesn't want to die, but this is how i feel for now. you cannot officially diagnose a minor i believe  


i feel extremely uncomfortable opening up about my emotions, so i do not want to go to a therapist at all. I'm a minor as well, so ill have to go to my parents, but they shall not take me seriously for it. i am not liable to commit murder or crimes or physical abuse to anybody in real life, so there is no need to report this to any authority. i just wanted your thoughts. thank you for reading, have a nice day"
1106,What are some of the best movies to introduce my something depressed little brother(16) to the Cinema?,"My little brother is at some very risky age. When I say risky i mean that he will be introduced ( actually he is introduced) to psychedelics, could also be a little bit depressed, which in a big rate of users, it ruins their life. My parents and I, are very worried for his wellbring. So our soulution until now was talking him down and clearing his mind that there are many interesting things in this life that may concern him and that are very interesting. I tried to introduce him to some ""Weltliteratur"", but i didn't achieve quite my desired outcome. I tried some of the best movies i know, but he seems to always check his phone for notifications, so that tells me he's not that very interested in movies. But i KNOW that the Cinematography of some movies can have a great impact on somebodys mind. I myself fell in love with cinematography at a very young age, but it wasn't the same case with my brother.

So if anybody could help me with suggestions that could be the use of awakening his interest in something, our family would be very grateful to you!"
1107,I don't know if I need to call the police or not,"I've been alone in my bedroom door months, coming out for water and toilet breaks/showering. I'm not really helpful to myself. I live in Pennsylvania, USA. I'm childless, single. Can't count on family. I'm basically slipping away to the point of isolating myself; no one knows my living standards or my parents unfavorable behaviour/treatment. I'm not having or thinking about suicide ideation thoughts. I do not have a job. I do not have any responsibilities; frankly. I do not own a car. I do not have any money in my bank account. I do not have a high school diploma. I do not have a therapist. I do not have a cell phone plan. I do not have a food or cash assistance stamp. I do not know anybody around me to feed/clothe/put a shelter over/bathe/care for me. I have a history of CPTSD. Psychological abuse by my parents. My birthday is March 11. I've been losing weight since I'm not able to eat once a day totally. I watch my Mom verbally and rarely harm his body. The police station is very close by. I think I'm going to pass out. My sleeping is poor. My nutrition is poor. My Mom keeps buying out of date, passed expiry, coupons, exotic, time consuming, heavy maintenance food that I can't stand to make."
1108,Thoughts and opinions for the class clown please,"I'm a junior in high school. I've always been known to be that one girl in school who makes a lot of jokes and laughs too hard but lately, more like.... since the start of the school year, I feel like I've been doing it too much or that it's kind of different. I feel like I'm on a high whenever I'm making jokes whether it may be about the dumbest stuff or my personal trauma. I feel elevated and making my friends laugh with my jokes makes me not happy but make me feel I have worth and I get a sense of who I am????? And what my purpose is?? Which is to enlighten people?? That is SO sad I know AHAHAHAH but lately I've been doing it too much to the point that I joke with adults and my teachers about how my winter break was traumatizing and act like such a fool and everyone laughs so I don't even care!! I feel so shameless when I'm joking around and acting like a class clown. Like I could do anything, talk to anyone I want and do whatever without caring!! And I want to jump!! Run and kick things and just do so many things and make so many plans and MORE!

But when I get home, I feel like such a failure. Sometimes I even stay back at school to talk to some people I don't usually talk to so that I could at least joke around or have fun conversations with someone before coming home. I feel like pulling my hair out when I come home and I listen to the same song for hours and hours! It feels like I'm not here and I'm just floating you know?? Or I'm disconnected from my limbs  and it feels like everything I've done for the day was a video? Like I just watched myself do things and make jokes? That sense of confidence and self disappears when I come home and I hate looking at myself in the mirror because it freaks me out. And I constantly pressure myself with what to do and what to say and I don't even know what to do or what I was even doing!!! At home, the slightest thing makes me want to scream and attack something and unleash all of my anger. I feel so different. I don't know who I am and that infuriates me. Everything infuriates me at home but in school, why do I seem so different? Why do I seem like a very easygoing and understanding person who makes people laugh???? Please help. I need some opinions and thoughts. I can't talk to anyone else about this."
1109,I need professional help.,My depression is growing more and more intense each day. People around me notice it but it's here. It scares me because I don't wanna do bad things to myself and it scares me that when I lose it. I lose it. I wanna go back to being me but I can't. I'm so empty. I need help.
1110,"I just served my dream girl, who I used to be very close to, at McDonald’s.",Nothing hurts more than seeing the girl you know you can’t have. I beat myself up so much for messing up the opportunity I had to be with her.
1111,I get anxious and nostalgic in a negative way when I don't have some thing or event to look forward to. What small future goal/challenge can I set to keep from looking backwards?,"I just finished a week long break from work and I found myself constantly trying to reminisce about fun and good things that happened in the past. It could come in the form of going back day by day of the the break and trying to pinpoint memorable experiences, or in the form of fun things that happened way in the past. 

I know it sounds good, but I personally find nostalgia to be depressing because I feel like I'm getting separation anxiety with a certain time instead of a person. I realize that this happens a lot toward the end of my vacations, wherein I suddenly feel lost with no real goal in sight. It's like I ask myself ""so what's my next move?"" and I can't answer so I feel lost and anxious. Things get better a couple weeks in where my mood stabilizes and I adjust back to working.

I suppose a change of career would be the best thing to look forward to, but but what are your ideas of  other smaller, simpler things/goals that one could set to keep them always looking forward instead of backwards?"
1112,Get your day started with me :),"Hey you, yes you! Remember that doing something poorly is better than not doing it at all. If you feel up to it, go brush your teeth. It doesn’t need to be the full two minutes. If you want to go to the next level, consider cleaning up two things in your room. You’ll feel better, I promise!

Even if you didn’t do this, don’t worry, there’s always another time. If you did, great! I’m so proud of you, being all productive. Regardless of what actions you did or did not do, I just want you all to know that you’re doing great. It’s okay if you feel sad or lonely. Just know that there are always people to help if you need it."
1113,What’s the point of being alive?,Really just need a second opinion on this
1114,Any advise for something to help me get out of depression (something new maybe?),"I have had depression since 4 years, I feel worthless, sad, lazy and just empty most of the time. Old things dont really make any fun anymore and when I have fun it doesnt really last long. Ive tried new things but lost interest either instantly or after many days. I am addicted to videogames but also cant really get free of it because its the thing that gives me at least a little bit fun. I just dont have anything that I want to do here anymore. Suggestions are welcome :)"
1115,Family threatening to kick me out (and why I'm not afraid of them),"So, I've repeated this some, but my mom has been laundering my money for 5 years (from 2015 when I first got put on disability until July 2020 when I got a new payee and she stopped receiving her checks) and now my new payee is paying for the mortgage ever since I switched to them (they say it's for the ""rent"" supposedly but a trailer where I live doesn't cost no $300-$400 a month) so in that case, if they tried kicking me out then the banks can simply seize the property. It's called foreclosure. If they're not paying the mortgage for a certain amount of time then the banks can literally take the property. Especially once those billing statements come out and we see who's been paying for what.  

But, let's say alternatively that I was my own payee. Well in that case if they tried to kick me out but I was paying for the utilities, then I could just shut everything off if that were the case. But it all boils down to who owns the place. But let's also say alternatively that I was my own payee and wanted to kick THEM out. Could I do that? Yes. All I would have to do is just buy the house and evict them. Which btw, a double wide trailer where I live costs only about $5,000 if that. That's about 8 months worth of hard savings if I were my own payee, since I get $700 a month from social security benefits. But even then, if somebody receives mail at that residence, you would still have to go through the courts because at the end of the day it is up to the COURTS to decide who stays/leaves, or alternatively you could file a restraining order after getting the police involved if they become violent. 

So long story short, if you've got disability and they threaten to kick you out, know your rights first."
1116,Uh wtf,"Not me refusing to stand up my wooden toy because the rod would hurt it-

Not me moving my stuffed animals legs so the blood doesnt flow to its legs and give them pins and needles- 

Not me petting my hedgehog mug because it looked lonely-

Tf is wrong with me LMAO"
1117,Please help i can’t find anything about this online,"Im so confused i keep doing things that confuse me so much. Like :

If I blink hard once I can’t stop and it lasts for like half an hour

If i wear jewellery for too long it feels like I’m having a panic attack and my arms are gonna fall off

I have always been really triggered by certain frequency’s of beats and it doesn’t make sense at all I’m so confused does anyone know anything about this or experience any of these at all ? I’ve asked my therapist and she doesn’t understand"
1118,Starting to wonder if I’m bipolar,"I had this really strange moment a few days before NYE when it felt as if something inside me broke. I spent days just sobbing and I was having suicidal thoughts. Then a few days later it just vanished and I’ve been weirdly motivated and happy since. I’ve started this campaign at my university that’s doing fairly well (I won’t share details in case my identity is revealed), I’ve been journaling and writing and I’ve been bizarrely on top of the world. I’m still kind of suicidal but I’m weirdly happy about it? Other aspects of my life are a complete mess. I’m behind academically and I’ve neglected so many other responsibilities. ’m living life in a really weird way and I’m honestly starting to scare myself. I’m not necessarily doing anything reckless but I know that I absolutely would be doing stupid, reckless things if it wasn’t for the pandemic. 

I’ve got a history of ‘living life to the fullest’ and I’ve made some reckless choices in the past but I’ve never, ever had this kind of rapid mood swing before. I’m so restless and I’m barely sleeping. I’ve got so many grand ideas that are just buzzing around in my head. I’m not sure what’s promoted this. I’m not sure if this is some kind of strange response to the pandemic or if it’s something that I need to be concerned for. Can you just... “become” bipolar overnight? Or am I just having some kind of weird mental break."
1119,I am sorry but I need to get this off my chest,"Don't read if you don't want to read a whole lot of negative stuff - I just need to vent A LOT of stuff that has been going on because it is driving me crazy keeping it inside of my head.
Sorry to whomever reads this, this will be all over the place. 

I am currently the unhappiest I have ever been.
I am so unhappy with my life that I literally don't care for anything at all.
All I want to do is lay in bed, read Mangas, play games, watch porn.

It's been 2 weeks that I get up at 4/5pm.
On Christmas I stayed in bed while my family was ""celebrating"" downstairs.

I miss people that are no longer in my life and don't want any contact. For whatever reason. Most likely because I am in love with them or because they were the only people that truly made me happy in my life, that I would want to spend every second of my life with.

I am in a relationship and I don't really care about it. Most likely we are going to break up and I don't care at all because other than for sex this relationship means nothing to me. I hate myself for thinking like this, but it's the truth unfortunately.

I am 30 and I have a job I hate that pays way too low to afford living in my own apartment.
But I also don't have the drive and will to look for a better job because I think so little of myself.
I have some freelance stuff on the side that piled up which would pay me some money but I am honestly not bothered completing it.

I can not talk to anyone. My family expects me to function. I wish somebody would ask me what I am thinking or how I am feeling.
All I hear is that I am a lazy fuck, that I am disrespectful and that I ""have to do this and that"".

Due to the pandemic seeing friends is difficult and when I see them, it always feels like a chore to keep relationships going. It's always me reaching out, too.

I hate my life at the moment, I want to change it, but I really don't have the energy and drive to do so.
I need help, I know that. But it seems like something so utterly pointless, because I feel defeated and lost.

Sorry for the negativity."
1120,I need help on how to help my depressed/ cynical father..,"My father (58) is really unsatisfied with himself and how his life went the last couple of years. Therefore he gets depressed and really cynical towards us. We tried for such a long time to stay positive and to help him, but mostly we get yelled at and negative comments and therefore our relationship and the one between my parents gets really difficult.

4 years ago my dad lost his job very beloved job, where he felt like really being special. That absolutely ripped apart the soil below his feet. He tried other, less difficult jobs and was fired over and over again.  --&gt; unsatisfied with himself

Due to not being a native speaker (around B1) and a stroke that  damaged the brain area needed for talking, he really has problems communicating in a good manner.  --&gt; more unsatisfied with himself

His body is a wrack, he has real difficulties walking. This aswell is a real problem, since he always was the active kind of person, getting alot of joy out of building stuff, reparing, garden work, etc.. Aswell his only hobby (golfing) isnt possible anymore. --&gt; even more unsatisfied

The relationship to my mum never was good, but it got worse because of his cynism and his way of going for negative attention if there isnt any positive one (positive one is really low due to his condition). Now my mom thinks about getting divorced. --&gt; kills the unsatisfaction

And the horrific part about this is our very own attitude towards our father. We love him, but its so hard to handle, because in exchange for almost everything we get yelled at, or a negative statement, etc... 

I really dont know what to do  anymore since today he jokingly said, that maybe he should just shoot himself.

I often spend time with him, trying to cheer him up, but it really doeesnt work..

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything you could imagine that would help him? He is quite conservative and not easily won over to try new things. I think he needs something to work with. Something that causes the feeling of accomplishing something, of taking having some kind of effect, etc. Something that gives him the feeling of not being worthless, not having a reason to live life anymore.

He refuses seeing a psychologist :/

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for my horrible text, but since his statement today I just cant think really straightly.."
1121,Who do I advise a toxic friend to seek mental help?,"My friend who I have been close with since middle school (more than 10 years ago), is becoming increasingly toxic. While I know his mental health is deteriorating, I don't want to be the tipping point for what he is going through. I am literally his only close friend who is in regular touch with him, even though we live in different countries. I know he struggles socially with family, coworkers, friends and acquaintances as he always gets in needless arguments.

Yesterday he flipped at me because I politely told him that I wasn't interested in the news articles he keeps sending me. I made sure I was polite as possible, by asking why he was so invested in politics of a specific country, where he proceeded to call me rude and other unnecessary names for not showing interest and not agreeing with his views. He  then blocked me on the platform we were texting, but I have him on other social media.

While I feel indifferent about this, as I don't have to endure unnecessary arguments every now and then, I am concerned for his mental health. He suspects that he has bipolar disorder and social anxiety, though not actually diagnosed. I just want him to seek mental help, as it might really help him around people, especially that he moved to a new province in Canada where he knows nobody there. How do I convince him to seek mental health advise?"
1122,Suddenly really energetic after depression,"I seriously don’t understand what’s happening, I was extremely depressed today regarding something but midway into the evening, that sadness dissipated and instead I just feel this intense amount of energy - extremely fidgety , unfocused, just having random thoughts and I just wanna dance. I even tried exercising to calm myself down but too no avail ( atleast I burned some calories). Its like 12 am rn which is usually when I sleep but I’m still energetic, I’m so sick of moving and I don’t want to anymore but I keep on fidgeting. I’m trying not to think it’s a sign of  bipolar disorder or something serious.Maybe I’m just having a mental breakdown and it will all be over tomorrow and I can live my life normally. Can someone give me any sort of advice on what it could be? I would really appreciate it cause I’m freaking out at the moment at tad :)"
1123,Not sure if I’m stupid or if I have add/adhd,I think I have adhd. As a child I use to be very hyperactive and disruptive. I couldn’t pay attention at all and still can’t. I usually get the talk “ your very smart and if you’d focus you’d probably score A’s in everything” I am now 17 nearly 18 and also have a hard time making friends and I suspect I might have developed SAD from ADHD. 2 of my cousins are diagnosed with adhd and a few other family members seem like they have adhd. I’m not sure what to do I basically check off all the symptoms and my parents won’t take me seriously and I don’t feel like seeing my school counseler or would help at all as they’d think I’m just looking for drugs ( I’ve never done any drugs or drank alcohol I’m clean). My room has  a tiny bit off mess but I always prefer it that way since it’s easier for me to find my stuff. If I shower and put on soap I get distracted and forget if I even put soap on. My memory is getting bad and I can’t focus at anything in school. Today a teacher in my class got mad at me for not listening g and told me I’m too focused in what I’m doing I forget about the world around me. I’m not sure if I have add or adhd and don’t want to seem like an attention seeker or a pain in the ass for my parents. I’m not hyperactive anymore but I still think I got all of the symptoms. What should I do! Help!
1124,Going off of Lexapro,"After about a year and a half of being on Lexapro, my doctor and I decided to wean me off. Obviously, I'm nervous because it feels like a big change, even if we do decide I should stay on a while longer, but I'm also kind of excited."
1125,Is excessive worrying and negative thinking alright for 3 straight weeks?,"I have been worrying about everything this past week, and its taking a toll on my life as of now.
Back in december weird changes has been happening to me and i've been talking and questioning myself about negative stuff, stuff like ""You are not mattered by your parents or others"" or ""Your face is ugly, why are you so ugly?"", just millions of voices in my head that gives me negative thoughts  and be on hyper alert when im talking to someone, whether my face looks weird, or my personality is bad and im offending them.
And even if someone just says something about me i always think that they're talking negative about me when it's not even that.
I've been trying to control these things, these voices in my head that keeps telling me negative stuff and i dont know what to do about it.

What should i do about this?"

1127,I am so stressed and I feel my mental health declining,"I am 25 and am in University. Honestly it is pretty hard when I had gone out to work abroad at 19, and have been working full time until I was 24. Adjusting to studying again after having financial freedom is torture. Not to mention many things just seemed unimportant, unnecessary, and stupid in University. Plus my income is significantly lessened as I can only work part time now.

A new semester began today, and I am already super stressed. My schedule is horribly full and I have to keep waiting around for one person's confirmation before I can confirm something with the other,.

And this really sucked, as I have just recently pulled myself out of a darker time the last few months. 

I feel like today just crashed me and the good progress I've made is fading away, and that my mental health is declining again. I am trying my best to be positive but holy crap it is hard.

Now I finally understand why my friend was breaking down frequently during her studies a few years ago 😭"
1128,"Last year I used all the courage left in my body to grab the phone and call the nearby clinic to book a meeting with psychiatrist. On the other end of the phone, the lady answered angrily yelling « this ain’t the day to book meetings! ». All my courage shattered, I gave up.","My new year resolution for 2021 was to try and look for professional help again. 
After a year of not being able to do anything about it, Two days ago I got my courage back up again and sent a mail to a local mental health helping center... I was happy with myself.

but I still haven’t received any answers.

Am I doing it wrong ? How am I supposed to find a qualified psychiatrist by myself ? I can’t find anything on Google but names and addresses. There isn’t any info on the psychiatrist themselves, only names without any pictures or infos on them..."
1129,Having stress/anxiety due to work,"I’ve been dealing with a lot of work related stress lately, I struggle with a lot of mental health issues but I do my best to keep pushing. Honestly I use to be so passionate about what I do but now it makes me feel sick to my stomach. I can’t afford to quit because I don’t know what else I would do for a living. I run an online eBay and Amazon store. Most of my stress comes from Amazon, Ive worked really hard to achieve the knowledge and success from doing it, the problem now is I just feel like quitting due to the anxiety and stress I get from it. I wish that wasn’t the case, I woke up this morning wanting to close my store, yes I’d still have eBay but most of my income comes from Amazon. 

I’ve actually been looking for a part time job to help relieve some of that stress that way it’s something for me to get out of the house aside from going to post office almost every day. But honestly I just don’t know what or would I do if I left my Amazon business. I started doing e-commerce when I couldn’t find a decent paying job after community college, as a result I had to drop out of university because I couldn’t afford tuition anymore at the time, I hoped my associates in business would of helped but it didn’t other than get me retail jobs...it’s weird how things in life turn out sometimes, this was my dream to be able to make a living online and I’ve been doing so for the past 3 years but now I’m getting sick of it... I’m not gonna quit but I really wish I didn’t feel like doing so. 

I’ve been meditating every night before bed to relive that stress and anxiety, plus exercising every morning helps but anyway I pray to God that everything turns out fine in the end and that I was just stressing over nothing. My goal rn for the new year as I continue to work on my mental health is to look for a new passion apart from reselling that I can see myself doing for the next 10-20 years. Not sure what other business ventures I could pursue especially rn during the pandemic but I’m hoping I can find something. Honestly any advice or tips is very much appreciated, thank you."
1130,i’ve just been proven how much of a burden i am. (TW: mentions of suicide),"last night i attempted to kill myself. clearly it didn’t work. and i decided to message this friend  that i loved her and stuff and i’m sorry and i just really wanted support at that moment. she told me to tell my parents but i said i can’t because my parents won’t give a fuck (and she KNOWS this) and it’ll just make me feel worse. then she goes and says “k well i don’t know what to tell you then :/“ and now she’s ignoring me. she has promised me hundreds of times before that i could always talk to her and this is the first time that i’ve decided to take her offer of letting her comfort me and she just proves everything that i thought about myself is true. clesrly i’m not worth shit. i shouldve lesrned my lesson the first 500 fucking times, everytime i think i found something good in my life i either ruin it or its not real. i’m done eith everything. the next time i attempt i’m gonna keep that shit to myself and just pray that it works."
1131,I get so invested in TV show relationships,"I get so invested in character TV relationships. Normally it's the two main/leading characters ( like Jim and Pam from The Office as an example )

I know its scripted, but whenever they argue I feel more emotion, like I know they're going to be fine the next episode, but it still sucks to see them argue.


Sometimes I look up spoilers just to make sure the characters are together and alive.



Is this me being dumb and sensetive, or just really good screenwriting?"
1132,Has anymore else experienced this?,"I have had this problem since middle school when I first showing symptoms of agitated depression which got so out of hand that I started hurting myself I forgot mention that all my life I have suffered from chronic anxiety and I'm also on the autism spectrum. I have moments where I have all these thoughts going through my head these are terrible thoughts about my family members dying or they are just about losing stuff I care about sometimes I even have thoughts about hurting myself or ending my life, I know that would be a selfish thing to do so I don't that's just an example of some of thoughts that will randomly pop into my head these thoughts upset and sometimes cause me to become very emotional I have had times like now where it has caused me to cry uncontrollably for hours. I try to avoid crying when these thoughts have gotten the better of me as I don't want people too worry about me and than I would have explain why I'm crying when I don't know why I feel so sad or upset, after these thought pass I feel terrible I just feel so depressed and I am just so emotionally and physically worn out that I just want to lay down and never get up. does this happen to anyone else or am I just alone here? what makes it worse is I feel bad about being depressed when I live a fairly good life I have no right to be depressed"

1134,"Anyone felt something similar, how did you solve it?","A question for anyone if anyone has had something similar or knows of any papers in relation to this I will try to describe the feeling that I feel periodically, though it might be just sadness and part of cyclical nature of life and have no place in here,  
I have been able to identify two patterns of this feeling, this usually occurs when I just feel like this is the closest thing absolute despair, nothing comes to mind as to why I would feel like that but it just happens,   


when this happens it feels like there is something of a dense substance moving through the body, to be more precise stomach, in addition to which there is, something like like wrapping over heart or heart region, but it does not feel painful more like some sort of pleasurable (different from anything else felt, either physical or emotional) squeeze with dark undertone (??) , can't help not sounding abnormal but the closest thing I can associate it with, is taste of honey, I don't really understand how to explain it but that is what it feels like, its like when you taste honey but instead it is a feeling,   
during this I feel like I am absolutely breaking down without a reason or sense, like pointless suffering. After which in minutes maybe half an hour at most, I feel clear or rather not much at all, sometimes it makes me laugh at how pointless this all was, I feel energized and happy and drunk, I think the happiness comes from being able to feel normal again in comparison to what was felt before but maybe it is just discharge of emotion that causes that, and then the next day I become monotone there are small fluctuations in emotions  (I am more of an introvert so as I understand the feelings felt are a bit toned down in comparison to other personality types) or rather I feel normal and time just passes by, until next such episode,   


Unfortunately about the second form I can't explain, I know it was distinct and it happened just now, but I have already forgotten what it felt like, I know it felt bad but I just don't remember what it felt like  
I have already forgotten what I felt before,

Either way the description might be too vague, now that I re read it, it sounds boring and not as expressive as I imagined previously, I want to believe that the emotions felt were far stronger but this is all I could write before losing it, I feel that this is not generally a good thing, and might be taking a toll on my health but at the same time I have already forgotten what it feels like,  


If you have similar experiences or feelings and you have found a solution to this I would like to hear them  


And seeing as we are still in week 1 of 2021, it still is appropriate so   
Wishing you all a Happy New Year, wish you love, endurance and happiness,"
1135,Random states of anger and self-loathing for no reason?,"I swear overall I'm fairly normal. I can cope with my job just fine, but man my emotions seem to be just completely oof the rail. I either feel nothing and intense emptiness, or suddenly my emotions will go apeshit.

Hell, even when a coworker just does as little as look at me the wrong way it's like I go down a spiral of self-hatred and extreme anger. My manager seemed slightly annoyed at me today (I think) and I can't cope at all. I'm drunk af and still extremely upset.
Why am I such an idiot that stuff like this gets to m"
1136,I need help.,"I've always had feelings of being worthless. It's a problem I try to cope with over and over again but I can't get rid of it. It's gotten to the point where I just want to lay down and wait for death to take me. If I die, I would just be forgotten, so nothing I do matters. I know I need help but I'm scared people will never look at me the same way again."

1138,There’s something about my ex,"I dated this girl for three years. Throughout our relationship it was always a known thing (among our families) that she has a very short temper and can be extremely hurtful when expressing her anger. She has recently come back into my life looking to be friends, which I would have no problem with because I care a lot about her, but even though we only just started becoming close again, she is very quick to anger- even when I didn’t do anything to upset her. The most recent incident was today. She called me complaining that she has a job interview and she didn’t know how she’d answer questions they would ask her. I told her she needed to give herself more credit because she has a lot of experience. She (half) thanked me and abruptly hung up. I let a few minutes pass and texted her telling her that the interview should go well as long as she remembers that she IS qualified for the job, and as long as she is polite to the interviewers. She thanked me again, but about 10 seconds later she told me she’s blocking me, that I’m all drama, and I need to grow up. It kills me when she talks to me that way, but I feel like I can’t even be mad at her because it’s so difficult for her to handle her emotions. I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this so I’d really appreciate some advice."
1139,On the verge of meltdown,"Omg i feel so bad! All i did was help change the email address on my daughters xbox account last night and it has completely deleted my husband’s email address and he’s now also unable to recreate it! 

I feel so bad and guilty, even though i didn’t realise it was going to do what it has. He seems to realise it was an accident, but i cant help but feel he now hates me for it! I have BPD and realise this makes mountains out of every molehill! But i now feel that bad that i feel like i need to SH to punish myself for doing what I’ve done, even though I haven’t done it in 18months and I’m scared of the consequences if i end up starting again."
1140,Can I be mad at a friend with severe depression?,"
I have a friend who has diagnosed severe depression. A few days ago he was admitted to hospital because of drugs overdose. I had met him shortly before this happened, maybe like eight hours or so. We just spent some time at my house (we were alone) and he went home.Two days ago I found out he actually accused me of forcing him to take the drugs. No one really believed him and I didn’t have to talk to police or anything but I’m still hurt. He knew that my parents are strict and I’d get into a lot of trouble if they found out someone accused me of something like this. Also I could even get into trouble with police. I can’t really think about him as my friend after he has done something so selfish. I don’t want to have anything to do with him. I’m also scared that he may get me into worse trouble in the future. On the other hand, I’m his only friend. He has severe depression and if he wasn’t ill he probably wouldn’t have done something like this. 
Should I just forgive him or do I have a right to be mad?"
1141,I feel like I’m not alright,"I’m in a state of being and feeling empty, nothing brings me joy anymore and I feel like I’m watching my life go by without being there, I don’t feel like I can reach out because I don’t want anyone to think there’s anything wrong with me and that I’m weak, I’ve noticed recently I’ve started to distance myself from a lot of people and it’s starting to worry me"
1142,I manipulate people into liking me so I can feel better about myself,"I feel really guilty about doing it, but I can't seem to stop. That's my only way of gaining some self-esteem. Making people fall for me and then breaking them. How do I stop? I fucking hate myself."
1143,What caused my mental health problems? - can regression therapy help?,"Hey everyone,

I have been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. I am currently in therapy and they diagnosed me with a few different things. The thing is, I am struggling with understanding where my problems originate from. Sometimes I feel like this is holding me back in getting better. My therapists seem to focus on the here and now but I would like to dive deeper in why I feel like I feel most of the time. I did some research and came across something called regression therapy. This should help bring back memories, things you haven’t worked through etc. Does anyone have experience with this? Other tips are welcome too. 

Thank you in advance!"
1144,What helps you get out of a dark cyclone of thought?,"For those that suffer from depression/anxiety, what helps you when your mind starts to race? For me, it’s either exhausting myself by exercising or going on YouTube and looking up videos of sounds of nature (waterfalls, birds chirping)."
1145,"Please help, my best friend is suicidal, she’s been through a lot lately and she’s telling me life is too painful to deal with and how she wants to leave it all behind","This is happening so abruptly but I’ve been expecting this for a while now, she’s been through crazy stuff no one really should, and I don’t know what to do as she’s texting me this.

What do I say to her to talk her out of these negative thoughts? I’ve tried talking to her about things to look forward to and stuff, but she says she hurts too much to even think about good things

Calling the police is out of the question though, it’ll destroy her family and I don’t want that. It would make her even worse

Btw, she has anxiety and depression so she’s had a history of mental health issues."
1146,Why am I a nitpicking asshole to my family?,"I live with my dad and uncle, and I’m currently back home from college for winter break and I’ve noticed in hindsight that I can be something of an asshole from time to time.

I get mad if they leave dishes on the counter or put them in the dishwasher in a way that isn’t exactly how I like it and I’m always cleaning something around the house and I get mad/irritated if anyone tries to talk to me.

I’m able to recognize this in hindsight, and I’ve communicated with them both that I don’t mean to get like that, and apologized. Fortunately, they’re both pretty understanding.

This is so uncharacteristic of me and it seems I’ve only been like this since coming back from college. I have a history with depression and anxiety, but it seems when I get in this mood I’m just outside myself and only later am able to recognize my behavior."
1147,Improving ones frustration tolerance,"I hope this is within the scope of this subreddit. I noticed over the last couple of years that my (28, male) frustration tolerance getting lower and lower. I never had the best frustration tolerance, as my gamepads from childhood can testify, but it has reached a level where it becomes rather concerning and has an impact on my live. Whenever something goes wrong (for example when cooking) I become nervous, annoyed and angry rather quick, even for rather small issues. Honestly, it can be described as an adult throwing a tantrum.

I would love for this to stop or at least become tolerable again. So any resources or stories from people who dealt with similar issues would be appreciated."
1148,Thoughts of rape won't stop. Advice?,"I am 13 years old. Around 6 was the first time I discovered porn but was caught shortly after. Because of how traumatizing that was for me, I didn't start watching it again till years later (10 or 11). I did not masturbate till 12. I didn't notice anything till recently. I've begun to have these violent thoughts about raping others and it freaks me the hell out. Last night was the worst because the thoughts literally kept me up for hours. It makes me feel so guilty and I worry about what this may mean about me. I've already told my mom (I didn't specifically say it was about rape, since I have thoughts about other things as well) and she said she'd take me to a therapist, but I want advice that I could use until we get professional help. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I greatly appreciate it."
1149,i want to kill myself.....,"im tired of life I can't its too much.

1150,Talking about my problems I guess. This is my first post.,"So this might be a silly story. The reason that I decided to finally post on this subreddit is because of a drawing I made. ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/drawing/comments/knmx59/i_dont_usually_draw_stuff_based_on_emotions_but_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) I draw a lot. My drawings sometimes have themes, and it can sometimes make me forget the sadness. but recently, I tried drawing something different. something personal. I tried to visualize my emotions. My TRUE emotions. so I closed my eyes (not literally XD) and started drawing. In the end, I looked at the finished sketch in disbelief. Not only was it the most impressive drawing I ever made, but it was the most detailed as well. however, that was in stark contrast to what I understood from it. The drawing didn't make any sense to me. It was conflicted. It showed self-hate and self-value. suicide, and trying to save yourself. and at the end, it just showed emptiness after being filled with emotion just seconds before.  
""Conflict"" 

That was what I ended up calling it. It scared me but I am currently trying to understand it, which is kinda my goal from this post.   
Let me get straight into it. I don't understand my emotions. I understand them individually, but I don't understand the reasons, and how they can be so conflicting. I'll try to explain them as best as I can. 

I feel extreme self-hatred, combined with feeling nothing. these happen at the same time. I feel like I hate myself, and I want myself to die, but at the same time, I feel nothing. I feel like a ghost watching myself rather than being me. Like I'm an observer to my own life. I feel like there is no reason for this though. I have no reason to hate myself. I'm not concerned about my body ( I'm not overweight or underweight or anything In fact I'm probably dead average) The other part I'm not really sure of

 I'm having a lot of suicidal thoughts, but at the same time, I don't want to die. and I don't have any reason to be suicidal. My family, while they can be strict at times, are caring, and provide me with everything I could ever want.

And while all this is going on, I somehow manage to show no emotions at all. no sadness. no happiness. nothing. I constantly feel like crying, but nothing ever happens.

so yeah. basically it doesn't make any sense"
1151,I cut myself after 3 years of not cutting.,"I don't know, I felt empty. I usually hesitate and berate myself before I cut. It's a pretty small cut and very shallow, but blood came out. However, the worst thing is that it did not make me feel better like it used to. Now I'm going to just make an X with the knife I guess. I guess I'm a gone case and my mind isn't working anymore."
1152,Is this normal or something I should get checked out?,"This has been on my mind for a while and I've hesitated fully speak to my family about it because I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle. Anyway, I'll get on with what I'm concerned about.

About 6 months ago I started to get worry and overthink things, I blamed this on the pressure from some exams I had coming up and thought nothing of it but then it started to slowly get worse.  I began to overthink and worry to the point I was losing hours of sleep. This affected my productivity and continued even after the exams. It then slowly got worse and I thought I should reach out for help and I talked to my mom about it. She said it was just stress and I shouldn't worry about it, I was satisfied with this response. Now recently people have commented that I've changed and looking at myself I can see this. I don't go out anymore, aside from schools really. I don't speak to my friends unless they ask me something directly and I fear judgement in almost everything I do. I am scared to talk to anyone face to face about this because then I get thoughts like ""You're weak"" and its this almost constant battle with my thoughts. I am either worrying what people think of me or having these illogical arguments in my head. Is this just stress or something more?"
1153,I’m scared of doctors,I turned 18 in december and now I have to visit doctors by myself and I can’t take my parents with me and I’m so scared. I have a visit in two days and it’s a very significant thing for my health but I’m panicking
1154,Finally trying to take agency over my life (early 30s),"&amp;#x200B;

I just turned 31, and am *finally* trying to take agency over my own life/career/future. I've known on some level that I struggle with severe depression for the past decade or so, and have dealt with (or refused to deal with) that reality in myriad of disastrous ways including (but not limited to) self-medication, angrily breaking things, or sulking like an intolerable toddler for hours on end. I have an INCREDIBLE, supportive wife, and I recently decided for her sake and my own to begin righting the ship. A few months ago, I swallowed my male pride and began taking medication for my issues, and it has helped immensely. In the past, I often let workplace irritants grate on me long after they occurred, and this led me to leave jobs all too quickly/take the bad energy home with me. Very uncool, but I lacked self-awareness big time because I was so absorbed by my own black cloud. The meds (**Escitalopram, 20mg**) allow me to stop ""sweating the small stuff,"" as they say, and it now amazes me how easily I can shrug off the little irritants that often used to swell into day-ruining spirals of sh\*t. The job I'm working now is just temporary, but once my term here ends I think I really think I'll have the mental and emotional fortitude necessary to stick with a job long term and not make myself/everyone around me miserable. Here's hoping my next employer can look past my sporadic work history and relative lack of experience. Not sure what the point of this novel is, exactly, except to say: **For anyone out there questioning whether medication is the right avenue for them, it very likely is!** I went about getting mine by first visiting a counselor I know and trust, then downloading the K-health app and asking which SSRI they recommended. There's a small monthly charge for the app, but it's been so worth it. Good vibes to anyone reading this, and congrats for surviving 2020."
1155,read the text,"for 2 months ive been living in constant desperation hand hopelesness so much so that i truly want to kill myself. everyday is a fucking struggle not to do it. my parrent get angry at me for being like this (fuck you i hope you fucking die) and my therapist tells me the same shit everytime ""there.s no i cant"". i want people to hear my fucking voice im fucking outraged i want to murder everyone"
1156,How do I cope with shame?,"My shame has caused me so much more harm than good as I’m sure it does everyone. Although, I feel like I have an abnormal amount of shame and I feel like I can’t stop feeling shameful. I try to numb it out with bad coping mechanisms which leads to more shame. Does anyone have any tips or tricks for this daunting feeling?"
1157,I sometimes can’t pinpoint whether I’m having a depressive episode,"I can’t pinpoint it because it feels normal? I’ll be hungry but can’t find the energy to make something... resulting in me losing weight. I lose weight so easily due to my fast metabolism which triggers my anxiety. I always blame my laziness. It’s like I won’t allow myself to accept that I could be having a depressive episode cause it doesn’t feel like one?

Even with showering. I’ll have days when I don’t feel like showering or socialising and the socialising aspect can last weeks and days. I then remind myself that I’m an introvert so it’s normal? Or when I have this overwhelming feeling of bursting into tears for no particular reason I’ll blame it on my hormones. I dunno what I’m trying to say here but I guess maybe I’m in denial I dunno. Sorry for the confusion"
1158,Potential auditory hallucinations of my roommate/friend plotting to kill me.,"Hello throwaway account for obvious reasons. So last night I experienced my biggest break in reality ever, I still don’t know what to think or do. And cannot stop thinking about what happened.

To start off I’m 21, have smoked weed on/off for the better part of my life since I was 16, so I am aware of the potential for it on-setting schizophrenia or even causing auditory hallucinations. I have experienced mild hallucinations in the past when high, but they have always been very minimal and I can always debunk them almost immediately as me hearing something from the sound another object is making. This usually happened when I became paranoid about something.

I went December completely sober, and have begun smoking again this year. It should also be noted I was rolling on molly last night (first time in 2 months) which is another problem but not the point of this post. I was having a great night to myself, playing video games, listening to music. I smoked a couple bowls outside my window and at around 2:30am I was settling down in bed. 

My roommate and friend has his room right next to mine, and he had to be up early for work today (4am) so I was paranoid about disturbing him and waking him up a lot of the night. When I was laying down in bed I had my tower fan turned on (which I believe could be the source of the auditory hallucinations) I heard him in the next room, he was awake and on the phone with his friend complaining about me, what I heard felt so very real. Looking back now it seems like he would have been louder if it was real. It started out with him saying a bunch of terrible nasty things about me, picking out my insecurities and saying how he never liked me among other bad things. I was sitting in bed feeling like absolute shit hearing him say those things, and I had suspected that he smelt the weed from my room while he was trying to fall asleep. He had gone December sober with me as well and we made a pact to only smoke once a month after. So the guilt could have played a a part in this too.

Things just got worse and I heard him raising his voice and in tears over the phone, saying how he has been “waiting a longtime to do this” and was describing how he violently wanted to “punch my fucking face in” I could sometimes hear his friend on the other end of the phone and it seems like he was almost reinforcing the ideas to my roommate. Agreeing with him and saying he should take action, kick my door in and kick my ass and kick me out of the apartment. Things then got even worse and I heard him saying things like “I’m actually crazy” “I swear to god I am going to kill him” after this is when things got so scary for me I called the police. I heard him making a video and it sounded like he was talking to the camera and was going to make a murder tape of killing me. It even sounded like he went to the bathroom outside of my room and said “This is where I will put the body” at this point I am sitting on my bed with a knife shaking, ready to defend myself if he walks in my room. So I call the police, they finally get here but I have to run to my building lobby to let them in the apartment. The 911 operator essentially told me I had to try and run past him to get downstairs and let the police in. I was almost sure if I had attempted to leave he would have killed me in the hall. I crept close to the door and could swear I was hearing him speak very lowly saying “Come out and play” taunting me behind the door. After another couple mins of trying to gain courage I grabbed my knife and ran out of the room to my apartments door, but before I left I froze and realized my roommate was in his room, lights on (which now makes sense because I had been hearing him for or we an hour, he now was getting up for work) he was not outside my door like I had thought. It was at this point I thought I actually could have been hallucinating, but it still felt like reality. So I let the police in, they separated us and we told our stories. After this they convinced me I was having auditory hallucinations due to the drugs. I felt crazy, like absolutely nuts. I believed them, it made sense, I even talked with my roommate after the cops left and I felt comfortable being around him. But I still can’t shake the idea that maybe I wasn’t hallucinating, maybe it was a coincidence that I was on drugs this night that he was actually saying those things. And he managed to lie to the cops incredibly well. The part that is breaking me right now is I don’t know if this was my mind playing tricks on me or if I actually heard what I thought I did. I feel like he might have heard me on the phone with the police and quickly went back into his room and acted like nothing happened. What sucks is I just have no proof that he did or didn’t say those things. I still feel very lost and scared.

TLDR: Had the scariest moment of my life, thought my roommate was going to kill me, just for cops to come and tell me I am hallucinating. Need direction, opinions and insight.

1159,How do you see yourself worth without the things you posses without being delusional?,"&amp;#x200B;

I understand self worth should be unconditional and you should be ""loved"" for who you are. But we are humans, and we use reason, logic, and emotions. How do you think you deserve attention, a specific job, love without being qualified or even work for it?

I am seriously trying to see why would I be loved and appreciated for nothing. I might be miss-using it as I am tying myself to materialistic things. But how do I see myself elsewise? I put limits on myself: ""if I did that, then I will get that""

Please walk me through it,

Thank you"
1160,Need advice (adhd),"My real psychiatrist and my therapist think I have adhd. I also think I have adhd, and I’m waiting to get diagnosed. I’ve been with these doctors for almost 2 years. The other day my mom took me to see a different “psychiatrist” than my usual one. He’s a real psychiatrist, but he doesn’t really do psychiatry; he’s like a gut health doctor. I told him I was probably going to get diagnosed with adhd soon. He told me that a diagnosis doesn’t matter and just leads to more medication. He also told me that if I had adhd I would know it.

Is him saying that a diagnosis doesn’t matter weird? To me it sounded shady, but I am also biased against him. Ever since I’ve learned more about adhd, I’ve started to think that I might have it, and so do my doctors. I just get doubts sometimes because I’ve heard that adhd gets over-diagnosed, and I don’t want to be a “fake”. This is how I felt when I got put into a mental hospital and diagnosed with depression. I was suicidal, but I still felt like I was a “fake” who was taking space away from people that actually needed it. Idk if this adhd is the same situation as the depression, but I think one thing I have is imposter syndrome."
1161,How do you deal with noisy neighbors when you've tried everything.,"I tried posting this in other places, getting little to no hope. Instead, criticisms about what I said without any critical thinking actually applied, and because my inability to explain things makes me useless. I don't know what to do anymore. Everything feels so fucking hopeless. 

When I try to care for myself, and get help. I'm just denied everything. These neighbors I live next to have been consistently bothering me, harassing me with loud music and noises, knowing full well I have bipolar and sensory issues, and autism. I've contacted the council and the police about this, several times, and nothing has to been done. 

I don't know what to do.

1162,Interested in practicing HIV disclosure virtually?,"If you have any questions about understanding disclosure or how to prepare for that conversation, consider joining our research study Tough Talks that utilizes virtual-reality based simulations to allow young people living with HIV to practice disclosing their status to sexual partners in a safe space.

This intervention program is not intended to get people to disclose their status to everyone in their life, but rather to help them decide who to disclose to, how to do it, and how to prepare for the outcome.

The whole app consists of four sections each focused on a different aspect of disclosure. Utilizing choose-your-own-adventure style games, informational and skills-building activities, and virtual-reality disclosure sessions, users can practice disclosing their status to avatars representing real-life people in different scenarios, experiencing a wide variety of outcomes from support, acceptance, confusion, and rejection.

1163,I just want this all to end Im so tired of this,"I feel like no one likes me I’ve had no one ask me how I was, or how I was doing, no one even texts me period.

My parents only care about my younger sisters, my sisters only care about themselves, and my cats think I’m weird.

I have no one to turn to I’m not good with being independent.

I’ve been so lonely and sad I thought trying to help others would make me feel better but it’s making me feel worse.

Like I found out about this blind aid, and well I guess I was too slow and missed the call to help and it made me want to cry.

I’ve tried to start focusing on my writing again but my adhd is seeming to shove me down a dark tunnel I can’t get out of.

It’s like I’m pushed to the side constantly I’m always last.

And I’ve talked on many sub Reddit’s I’ve tried talking to others putting myself out there and I never get anything almost no one comments no one answers.

I had posted on the advice thing and well I had two people comment and they where to tell me not to post that kind of stuff on here that I’m just trying to get attention but that’s what I want I just want someone to notice me I guess to actually care.

Anyway I later looked on the subreddit and noticed someone had posted practically the same thing and got almost 300 people commenting nice things about that person and so on.

I just I think I’m ready to give up on life.

I just want everything to end.

1164,College student can not focus in anything anymore.,"(sorry for my English)

Im a college student (20 yo) and I noticed a huge difference in my behavior. Since the beggining of the semestre I can't focus on my study and it's worrying quite a lot. The course I'm in (software developing) has been my dream for a few years, was very motivated the first year of the course, but now, everytime I try to do any college work, I cant. I just can't. I want to, but my brain doesn't let me. Everytime I sit on my computer, commited to study, I feel very very tired, like I haven't sleep for a day. This type of behavior didn't happen before and I cant keep going like this. I need to get back to my usual ""me"" so that I dont destroy my grades.

I couldnt wait for this to go away so I did a self-evaluation. Searched for Major Depression Disorder and apparently I have a lot of symptoms.

These are the symptoms that I consciously was able to identify:
-Impaired concentration, indecisiveness
-Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities nearly every day
-Hypersomnia (excessive sleeping) almost every day
-Fatigue or loss of energy almost every day


My questions:
Im trying to find the cause for this problem so i'm starting with the most obvious.

Can smoking weed once a week, max twice, (sometimes  once a month) be the cause?

Can it be my daily routine? I basicly wake up, eat, sit on my computer working and playing videogames, go to classes (my classes are at night), come back to play games and sleep (during the weekend i usually just hang out with friends).

Can my sleeping schedule  be the reason for my sleepy mood (im usually awake untill  5am and i sleep until 1pm)

Im consulting a professional anyways, but I really wanted to get this out of my head because Ive been overthinking and stressing out because of this."
1165,I think i got a mental health problem but i cant find out what it is,"Hi i wasnt going to make this post but i dont know whats worng with my head like i am never conscious if you know what i mean ill go the whole day with out making concussions decisions. I feel like im going crazy kinda because if im in a car and try to go to sleep it feels like i am going to fall through the car if that makes since.
I used to meditate and i felt aware and there now i rarely do now when i try to meditate i fall asleep or i think of something then get up and do it while thinking about 3 other things to do then ill half do one and start another one and im sick of it i been trying to become more conscious for months now. I smoke weed but i feel like when i smoke it makes me more awake and so i dont got to feel all the  negative emotions. I am trying to quit weed but for some reason i just cant now. i have before but that was after a acid trip and after that trip the next day i smoked some weed and it just didn't feel the same and i stopped and i felt like that was the peak of my life and now im just going backwards. And it kinda mlaes me think like what are we why are we here like humans and everything is weird its like someone made there own simulation and im living in it and it makes me feel crazy."
1166,To people who have recovered from depression: What Has Helped You?,What do you personally think has mostly contributed to your recovery?
1167,School is stressing me out more than ever,"I'm failing all of my classes, have no motivation to do the work and want to kill myself when i even just hear the word ""school"". I'm on the verge of trying to kill myself because i know i'm going to fail this year of high school and probably have to re-do everything. I don't want to deal with everything anymore and i really don't now if i'll even be able to last another month through this."
1168,"I feel like, 'Keep Waiting' is Not a good Strategy","There must be some essential thing missing from my life. I'm almost always depressed.

All my therapist and people around me say is ""just wait, it'll get better"". But I feel like I have to actively seek fulfillment, waiting won't help me.

I feel trapped, how do I start taking care of my metal health? What are some steps that I can take?

What does a human need to feel fulfillment?"
1169,Intrusive thoughts about death.,"First of all, I don't have any suicidal thoughts, in fact, I fear death, and yet to find a way to cope with the idea that my loved ones, friends or I will die one day, and simply just stop existing. It's terrifying.

I have these thoughts almost on a daily basis, and ruins my day (or even week) instantly. 

How can one cope with the idea of eternal oblivion? What's your philosophy that helped you?"
1170,The psychological and mental health effects brought upon the class of 2020,"When you turn 18 and graduate high school the world opens up to you, endless opportunities, traveling, seeing the world, going to concerts, and living life before you start settling into adulthood. Unfortunately the class of 2020 was hit hard with what I can only describe with 2 words “very unfortunate” I am personally a victim to this also as I am part of the class of 2020. I remember the last words from my teachers before being let out for spring break ""Remember the project is due when you guys come back"" it is now 2021 and it still feels like spring break never ended. I have seen what this pandemic has done to the mental health of my classmates and i can tell you its very scary to see. They have no motivation to do anything and have fallen into drugs as an escape to this dark gray world that all of us now live in. I remember how colorful the world used to be, but now i see the world as this gray mist that's not fun or enjoyable in anyway shape or form. Why does it seem this issue is not addressed at all besides very few sources? We are indeed the future of the world so in my opinion it seems like a very important issue that should be a priority. Unfortunately as we all know the world has there focus on other things like power as we seen from the 2020 US election. This is truly a really dark time and its even more scary when you see the people that has raised you into this world are lost themselves and don't even know what to do. My question for you guys is what do you think the future of this generation is looking like and the psychological effects that this era will bring upon this generation for the remainder of there life's?"
1171,Am I experiencing delusions or just being over reactive?,"I'm unsure whether I am experiencing delusions or just making normal thoughts more than they truly are. I don't know how to describe it but I have completely irrational thoughts that I almost fully believe in the moment but looking back its absurd. The most recent example of this would be earlier today when I was out. I kept looking at number plates on cars and I was trying to find patterns as if it was some kind of code. I know this is absurd and I even thought this at the time, despite that I couldn't shake the action of doing that. Is this something normal that you do to entertain yourself when bored or is this a delusion."
1172,Hey uhm i just need to rant,"TW: Eating disorders, depression

So I have bulimia (Binge eating and then throwing up). I‘ve had it for over two months now and my sister found out in december. As i was throwing up in the bathroom and she told me „Throwing up won‘t help“. After a couple pf weeks i thought she forgot about it and thinks i stopped. And this happened about half an hour ago. So she brought chocolate croissants and said „Come and get one“ I was really tired and said „No thanks“ she then asked me if i already ate and i said „Yes“. Then she asked me what i ate and i said „2 Bananas i think idk“ then she told me to come upstairs and she said „I know your sticking you finger down your throat, i hear it i‘m not deaf. I notice when you throw up. I give you two choices. 1. You continue with this and i send you into a clinic before it gets too late or 2. You eat in a healthy or small amount. You‘ve lost weight i noticed it. Are you in any groups?“ I used to be in a group but i left because i felt better alone „No“ then she said „I know you‘re in a group i see it. Well I won‘t tell mom but i want you to be healthy. You can go now“ Then i left. I‘m in the living room downstairs right now, i‘m cold, my breathing has calmed down but i‘m still kinda trembling. I don‘t know what i should do, i‘m scared of my sister, i want to lose weight but i also don‘t want to end up in a clinic since my mom thinks only crazy/insane people get into those. I don‘t want to get called a psychopath by my own mother but i also don‘t want to binge with the knowing i won‘t be able to erase it. Adding to that i have suicide thoughts the whole time because i‘m stressed. I just don‘t know what to do. My friends don‘t know about my eating disorder and i don‘t want to tell them. I just need to let this out without anyone of my friends knowing haha, i hope this at least worked..."
1173,Whiskey for Panic Attacks?,"I know it's probably ""unhealthy"" to medicate with alcohol, but I have panic attacks very infrequently so it's not like I'm using it all the time... I've just noticed that, like, one shot of whiskey and I can be a functional human being in the middle of a panic attack. Two and I can actually go to sleep. Obviously it won't work if I need to drive somewhere, but if my friends want to hang out virtually or if I need to get to bed, whiskey seems to be a perfect remedy. 

Without it I can barely breathe, feel like I'm genuinely dying, and although I can still *do* things, I can barely manage to get a word out before I feel like I'm suffocating. 

I get that it's probably something I shouldn't rely on, but is it really a huge problem to take a shot of whiskey so I can be a functional person for a couple hours when I need to be? Are there better solutions? And, like, even if I were to develop a dependence on alcohol, is that really worse than feeling like I can't breathe?"
1174,They stuck me in a mental ward for 23 days,"They stripped me naked.  They injected me with drugs to knock me out while they held me down.  One of the guards threatened to beat me and said he beats 20 patients a day.  He said he rapes patients.

They drove me to a hospital in a town I've never been to.  They tested out all sorts of drugs on me.

They can't break me.  I'm going to keep fighting.  They can beat me again and again.  I will win or they will kill me.  I'm out now fuckers.  I'm on the streets."
1175,Why do I get so angry at losing,"I spend a lot of time playing video games with friends and god damn, I get so angry at them when they win, I just want to be the only one who wins. When they win it just doesnt feel fair and it pisses me off. Even when I have the advantage losing makes me feel so jealous. If one of my friends doesnt play a game with me then it makes me want to ruin that game for them to play with me. I just want to be the best and I dont know why."
1176,"Do you get "" *WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH MY LIFE* "" moments on thier birthday.","I turned 20 on 3rd January. I tested positive for covid 19 on New year's Eve. As a result I spent my birthday alone in quarantine. My family and friends wished me but as my birthday was coming to an end, I was left alone with thoughts &amp; I was contemplating what I did with my life so far
Everyone I know from high school made it big &amp; I'm still living the old nostalgia. I feel really bad wasting my time aimlessly.

1177,Can seeing a good therapist help me find a purpose in life?," I am 31, male, I would say I have looks and definitely have the smarts.  
In theory I want to achieve a career change and have a family on my own... In reality I am bored to the core with life, just drink beer (COVID19 made things worse with clsoing gyms)... I am basically self-sabotaging and just rottening, doing nothing. Worst thing is my old depression plus anxity kicked in a month ago, I am on meds again, I thought I had beaten it for good two years ago...

This may sound like a deeply phylosophyical question, but it is not - it is absolutely prgmatic. Even until a month ago when I was still not depressed again I really had no purpose in life, though pretending I have one, but atleast I was calm and content. Now, it is the same but it feels tragic and as if life is a burden. So knowing why I live, giving me a reason to wake up on a terrible day is cruical for my being.

I am going to start therapy soon. I just feel so bad that I am that old (31), still no big money in the pocket, career, family and now, again - mental health problems..."
1178,Happiness in Life (85),"We are all carrying around daily baggage; stressors, anxieties, money payments, tasks that need to be accomplished, goals, our love life etc etc. With all these constant feelings of worry and pain, its easy to lose track and forget what the meaning of life is, **gratitude of the present moment, to be alive in itself.**

We are constantly consuming social media, news, articles, movies, tv shows; having those ""fomo"" *Fear Of Missing Out*, feelings, that remember, we allow ourselves to feel. We all think that we all have to be aware of everything new that is happening, the latest album, the latest netflix show, the latest person that went viral, the latest artist, the latest clothing release, the latest new thing that we MUST have, but do we ever stop and ask ourselves why? Why have we been conditioned to feel this way? Why have we allowed ourselves to be conditioned this way? Why have we never taken a step back and realized that life is still happening, even if we have no idea of the ""new"" it thing?

Up until a few years ago, I had always been a subject to this. Always wanting to be ""apart of the crowd"", not missing out because I thought that I'd be looked at as ""weird"" ""a loser"" ""strange"" ""out of it"" etc etc. Until I realized, when we are **ALL** focusing on not missing out on ""the new thing"", what is really happening is that we are missing out on ourselves. Missing out on our life right now. Missing out on the **present moment.** Missing out on waking up and saying wow, **I am alive**, I was allowed to start a new day, which ultimately is more important than any ""trend"", any ""new thing"" etc. 

Now realizing that we have been conditioned to forget the true **meaning of life**, which is **happiness, family, gratitude, empathy, kindness, perspective, joy and presence, we can change that**. It may honestly feel overwhelming or even uncomfortable to start focusing on these aspects of life that make us, **human.** We have to start and we have to start **today.** As we have seen in the last almost year, our world has changed and will consistently change in this coming year. Remember that being aware of whats to come may cause fear for a brief moment, but of course it will, when we have been shown otherwise our whole life. 

Take a breath. Take a moment for yourself. Meditate Daily. Pray Daily. When we are connected with God, Jesus, the Universe, the Most High; we are putting all of our faith and life into everything above this planet, rather than other human beings that are just like us, something else that I can get into it, but we will save that for another day.

**Today:** Get fresh air. Get outside. If you haven't meditated before, go to youtube and search ""Meditation for Beginners"". It will make you feel uncomfortable but anything that pushes comfort zones is actually what is meant for us, in this present moment and whats meant for us for our longevity. Pray as well. Ask for Guidance. Ask for Help. I believe in you. With all of us, changing the way we think, act, feel with ourself, that will then lead to us changing together. **Together, Separately.**

**I love you.**

1179,NEED HELP,"My parents always called me a mean child growing up, I used to come home from elementary with referrals from hitting other kids. It’s progressively got worse the older I got, I enjoyed hurting others although I didn’t like the consequences I got from it which was getting yelled at by my parents. Now I have the urges to hurt others, I am too soft and tucked away to actually do it, I would talk to my therapist about it but I was told any thought about hurting myself or others would get me sent away. I think this all started when I was wayyy younger, I was a very sensitive child, getting upset over things important to me but my mom would belittle me for it till I stopped showing emotions towards things, all those built up emotions makes me the person I am today, aggressive and toxic, I hate it cause I don’t want to be THAT person. The thought of me hurting someone else’s feelings brings me entertainment, though if it happened to me I would flip which is hypocritical. 


The thing is I live off of peoples validation, my sister being the oldest was always looked upon cause she behaved better than me, got better grades. She even has the better genes. I am jealous, even when I do get into arguments I always look to her to help me cause she’s my sister and she always sides with my parents which hurts.  I don’t have a social life outside of social media because I am afraid of what would happen if I did."

Although it did take a toll on my mental health.,"I tested positive for covid on new year's Eve and I was showing few symptoms like mild cough.

1181,Venting,"I feel so useless and alone. I have zero talents. I am not even pretty. I have no friends. Nothing. And I don't even have a mental illness. I don't even have that. I am so flat and I don't even have an excuse. I don't belong anywhere either. I don't belong with those that have mental illnesses and I don't belong with neurotypicals either. I am all one in the middle. I am so boring and unremarkable. I have nothing. I wish I could at least have something. Even a tiny thing I am good at. Even one thing. Something, anything that will make me be seen. That people will actually tell me I'm good at. I don't have a personality either. I don't even have likes and dislikes. I don't even have a favourite book or food. Sometimes I wonder if I am even alive. At least if I was diagnosed with something I would have that. Not an excuse But somewhere to belong.

1187,I think my mental health is in a very negative and dangerous place currently and need help,"Hi my name is jack I am 24 years old and suffering with severe depression but I have noticed more recently I have had horrible evil thoughts and possibly urges to do very fucked up and terrible things I think I'm going insane. I have seeen a lot of incredibly awful evil things online and it has fucked me up severely mentallly. Murder, torture, abuse, rape the curiosity gets the better of me and I continue to dig deeper to find the bottom of the barrel. It started off with people doing stupid shit breaking their arm or getting injured in fights extreme car crashes and it has spiraled deeper and deeper into finding snuff videos of mass murder cartels torturing people animals being tortured rape child abuse and I feel like I'm going to break and possibly kill myself or hurt someone else"
1188,Obsessed with perfection,"Hey all! I recently realized I’m obsessed with perfection but NEVER actualize the perfection. For example: I want a clean minimalist house but instead of action, I just research it. Same with healthy eating and weight loss. Research and obsession, no action. This obsessive planning and research and lack of follow through is making life pretty miserable. I’m not sure what to do or if this is even a thing. The only research I found is OCD but I don’t have the tendencies (I think) meanwhile the stress of NOT having perfection around me consumes me and causes me to shutdown and do even more nothing. Anyone else in the same boat?"
1189,I feel like I am becoming desensitized to death,"I feel like I am becoming desensitized to death and that makes me feel like a psychopath.

I lost a lot of people last year in horrible ways. I am still trying to recover from that and today I found out that my friend was murdered. 

Of course I am sad that he is gone, mad that he had nothing to do with anything and still got shot. Idk, mostly I feel empty. I couldn’t cry, I am not even sure what to say. 

I feel like I already lost so much, there is not much more to be taken from me."
1190,Issues with accepting to be average forever,"Maybe somebody has an idea or something i have never heard before. I'm from Germany.

To give you a rough baseline about me i had my first psychologist when i was 10 years old, life happened and i gave up on school because i couldn't handle it. My mother, my therapist (when i was 15 years old, i had multiple in my life) and the school agreed that it's better for me to quit school because of medical reasons. The authorities rated me as unemployable and i was released from all duties and responsibilities.

Now i'm 31 years old, i had 18 years of therapies and stuff, i tried medication but it didn't really help, i have no school degree, no job qualification, no real hobby's (i keep myself busy with video games and youtube) and i have no future that's worth pursuing.

I had multiple therapists telling me that they are surprised that i never tried drugs, alcohol or suicide. That stuff never came to my mind for a second no matter how bad i felt.

My current problem is that i know that i will never be good or even great at something. I will get low wage jobs (if i get a job at all) for the rest of my life and will top up with benefits from the state. I know that.

At the same time i feel kinda torn because i have the urge to be better at something than most people. I hate the idea of being average and want a life where i'm independent. So my problem is that i'm stuck between 2 worlds.

One world is the knowledge about how my future will look like and the other world is a massive internal anger, frustration and pressure against being average and a peasant for the rest of my life.

Is there something i can do in order to finally accept the facts and reality? Is there something i can do in order to get rid of that inner ""drive"" or ""urge""?

How can i surrender to reality?"
1191,Maybe won't delete this time.,"Recently I've posted to this subreddit a couple times but deleted them because I was scared. I was scared that maybe someone I knew would see it other than the two I know about. That kinda scares me too but whatever. I've felt not so good lately. I spend my days sleeping and cuddling my pillows on the verge of tears but unable to get any out. I grip my hair and tug, I hit my head, I bite myself. I don't bite or hit very hard most of the time but it's sickening. I miss feeling like I don't annoy anybody. There's this one person who I for sure annoy and I want to apologise to them but they'd just deny it because they're too nice. I wish I could just go into a coma for a couple years. I don't want to die. Not anymore. But I just can't focus on anything. My brain feels like it's fried and I don't feel like I'm ever really there. My teeth are pretty sharp. I think that's kinda cool. I feel like a vampire haha.. no that's stupid, I'm stupid. My uncle called me a nothing. That's been on my mind the past couple of days. It really is making me question my worth. He may be right. All I do is sleep and never leave my room basically. I wish I could just read peoples minds. It would make everything so much easier. I would know who I truly annoy and leave them alone since I'm not wanted. If you would leave a comment saying something nice that'd be lovely but don't feel pressured at all. You're amazing."
1192,Lexapro and alcohol,"I've been on Lexapro for 8.5 weeks. Prior to starting, my wife had a health scare that went on for a few weeks. I had a few weeks of very poor sleep, that lead to nightly ruminating, that lead to daily ruminating about past regrets and severe bouts of anxiety and depression due to not being able to shake the memories off. I'm talking crying in my car in a parking lot of a Walmart for an hour bad. This is all new to me. I'm normally the guy that can push through any of life's challenges and get done what needs to be done.

The first 10 days I really saw no improvement (expected), day 10 I started to see a a small improvement. By week 2.5 I had a dramatic improvement which carried straight through the Thanksgiving holiday. Week 4 I started noticing anxiety creep back in. Week 5 the anxiety became nearly unbearable. But in week 6, it all faded quickly and I had another wonderful 2 weeks which carried through the Christmas holiday. By New Year's Eve, I was feeling the anxiety creep back in and now, a few days into the new year, it's really creeping back in again.

A common thread I can find is that with both holidays, I drank quite a bit being in the festive mood (the days before, day of, day after ... probably day after that too). Not stammering drunk or anything, but the amount that I would normally drink around the holidays. I can definitely hold my liquor, so what I say is not enough to get me sloppy drunk would still be considered a good amount I'm sure.

My question is, could a few days of heavier drinking be the cause for what is setting me back as I otherwise make progress on Lexapro?"
1193,Mental health is in a dangerous place I need help,"Hi my name is jack I am 24 years old and suffering with severe depression but I have noticed more recently I have had horrible evil thoughts and possibly urges to do very fucked up and terrible things I think I'm going insane.

1194,Why does it keep getting worse?!?,"I'm so freaking mad I can't stand it. Every time i try and get a therapist It starts off fine and then they make it worse.

First time i went to therapy I couldn't fit into the lady's paint by number depression chart so at the end of i guess the evaluation survey or whatever she said ""well, your Depression is manageable so i can't help you. Come back when you're suicidal again."" And i left feeling like all the hard work i've done my whole life just to survive with depression some how some way ruined my chances of getting help. I've had depression since i was maybe 13 but no one believed me (myself included) and then in high school i had suicidal thoughts. We learned about Depression and Suicidal thoughts in health class so i knew what to do and went to my mom. She talked me out of the thoughts but didn't believe i had depression, that it was just my ""time of the month"" and that i was stressed from my high school changing location and all that jazz. I didn't get to see a therapist until after college and this is what i get- my depression is manageable, come back when you're suicidal again. well turns out I have suicidal ideation but that doesn't count. I wasn't broken enough to get help.

Second time i got a therapist was in 2020 for obvious 2020 reasons but also because just about every month if not every three weeks something horrible happened, back to back. I needed help with my depression, i was suicidal again, i was developing trust issues, i had no one to support me other than my sister and all she told me was to get a therapist so thats what i did. the guy seemed like he could help me, seemed trustworthy, but in the end all he did was guilt trip me. ""Oh you don't trust your friends because one of them hurt you? do you think thats fair to your other friends?"" and ""Oh you feel like you can't trust new people because of the things your ex-friend did? i guess you'll just never have friends again."" and it worked until i started to think about what he was saying- because i didn't WANT to not have friends anymore, thats why i got therapy. we didn't even tough on the suicidal thoughts or my lack of support. just making me feel bad for having these trust issues over what he implied to be ""nothing serious"". all he did was make my trust issues WORSE and now i don't even trust therapists!

and the third guy. the third guy didn't contact me for 3 weeks (old therapist said he would contact me that week) and when he finally did its to tell me I have to schedule the appointment because he lost contact with my old therapist, didn't know anything about me, and was on a different insurance than the one i had (which doesn't matter since i don't have any insurance now). I can't tell if my trust issues are telling me i can't trust him, or if its the fact that he didn't do anything i was told he would do that is making me not trust him.

I was always told therapy would help. Therapy was the goal! Therapy would help me and i would be okay if not normal and i wouldn't be a disaster 24/7 but nnnooooooo i had to get THESE GUYS! 

it makes me want to freaking SCREAM!"
1195,How do I get over sexual assualt?,"My ex sexually assualted me about a year ago. It was bad, but I stupidly decided to give him another chance. He broke up with me a while ago, and I feel like absolute garbage. I feel hurt. I feel like he used me and threw me away after he got what he wanted. 

I hate him with my entire being and it's killing me. It's changing me. Isn't there a quicker way for me to get over it? I don't like what it's doing to my brain, and talking to my therapist is taking too long. Maybe I can switch parts of my emotions off or something... I'd appreciate any advice."
1196,I don’t know how to start therapy,"Hi guys, i’m hoping someone could give me a bit of advice or support. This might be a long post so please bear with me. I will also leave a general warning for anyone who needs it because I’ll talk about some uncomfortable subjects, like self harm. 

I’ve had a history of depression, anxiety and eating issues. I was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for several months at 15 (so 2015) and between 2014-2017 i was hospitalized several times in psych wards for suicidal+self harm thoughts and behaviours. After a bad experience with a psychiatrist in 2017, I lost faith in the mental health support system. It was a psychiatrist I had seen in 2014-2015, the first thing he told me when i walked into his office again years later was “I see nothing has changed”. He diagnosed me with “severe borderline personality disorder tendencies” and one of the last things he said to me was “I just can’t help you.” I lost all confidence, and the more i researched BPD the more i feared ever speaking out because it seems there’s a lot of stigma surrounding this diagnosis... while i do recognize several of the symptoms as issues i am facing, I’m not 100% sure that this is even what I am struggling with, at least not the “classic” version, for lack of a better word. During this period I also went through sexual assault (well technically it was rape but i don’t feel comfortable using that word...) and everything just became too much, and i isolated myself from any and all help and support.

For the past 6 months, my mental health has been steadily declining. I’ve dropped down to 89 lbs, I feel like i’ve been so depressed and anxious all the time that it’s made me become “stupid”, i can’t think straight anymore, I have trouble with memory, i feel like i have lost the ability to be a “normal” functional human. I feel like i can’t communicate with others anymore. My main coping mechanism through all of this has been retracting in to my own “world”. I am actually quite scared of this, because although i wouldn’t describe it as a break from reality, i feel like i am living a separate reality in my mind and i find myself unable to pull myself out of it. I will pace for hours and hours having these fake conversations with people, fake therapy sessions even, and when I am in this “world” it is so strong that I even talk out loud to myself and laugh and cry, I’m sure if anyone ever caught me in these moments they would think i’m psychotic. I have also resorted to what is probably a form of self harm, i pick at my skin and my nails and it has gotten to a point where i am ripping out my nails from the bed, and they can’t heal because I keep picking. It’s not that I want to hurt myself necessarily, but the pain and the act of picking is soothing to me. Even when i feel okay, i find myself mindlessly picking. I can’t stop. i’m always wearing bandaids around my fingers, i never take my socks off anymore because i’m always missing at least one toenail... I feel really embarrassed. 

Anyways, so today I took the first step. I went to a general doctor and talked with him about some of my symptoms. I did not mention my coping mechanism, BPD, the sexual assault nor much of my eating issues because i felt too embarrassed. But I was given a referral for psychotherapy and he prescribed me Effexor for my depression. 

Now, though, I find myself feeling really scared to actually find and book an appointment with a therapist. I feel like I don’t know where to start. I feel scared to open up and explain what I am going through. I can admit to myself now that I have not always been honest with past therapists, and as much as I want to be honest i struggle with telling the whole truth. 

I feel like i have too many problems? I don’t know how to find the right therapist for me when it just feels like i have so many things to work on. Depression and anxiety, personality disorder issues, sexual trauma, some childhood issues that i believe have affected the way i am today, eating disorder, self harm... I realize that thinking this way isn’t helping me, but i can’t help feeling overwhelmed with everything i need to “fix”. I feel scared to actually open up to someone and face my own problems. I am so used to running from them but i’ve reached a point where I know I can’t do that anymore, and I don’t want to do it anymore. I just want to feel better. 

I am also nervous about having therapy over video calls/ phone calls. I find that one aspect of therapy that has helped in the past is being able to speak face-to-face with someone, although I know this is just something I will have to get used to.

What do I do from here? Should I just email potential therapists with a summary of what i’m going through? Or is this sort of thing reserved for when I actually get an appointment?

Thank you to anyone who’s taken the time to read this. I’m a little scattered, so i apologize for the rambling. I think I just need a little bit of reassurance and guidance on how to take the next steps."
1197,Just some words I needed to put somewhere.," 

Beware.

You are about to delve into the unknown. And, no. Not that romantic, exciting, “I can’t wait to see what happens!” unknown.

The kind of unknown where you are walking toward a black hole and you’re not really sure whether you’re about to go down it, or up, or just swirl around into the abyss hoping to land somewhere but there’s actually no destination. Just the black hole.

Welcome.

It’s not always this dark here. Just today.

Well, just some days.

Most days, the sun is up, the sky is blue and I try to be normal just like you.

I get up, drink my coffee, thank the sun for rising and hope that I can contribute something to the day that encompasses even the slightest bit of that sunshine.

There’s just no sunshine today.

I’ve tried to teach myself to BE the sunshine. To create the light in the black hole that seems to just not accept it.

I’ve been successful at this. Many times. I somehow manifested that warmth within myself and counteracted all that was swirling through this bottomless pit with me. Those days, I won.

Today, I’m failing. I’m trying to revel in those past successes but there’s just so many fucking clouds today. It’s cold. Both out there and in here.

I think it’s just fog. Just some vast gray lingering about all mysterious, leaving all that’s beyond it untold.

Secret: I know what’s beyond it.

Well, I don’t. But I know that it’s chaos. It’s loud and thunderous and the lightening is so fucking beautiful even if it might be destroying some stuff along the way.

Days like today, I want to want to dance through that chaotic space with a maniacal smile on my face screaming fuck it to the sunshine.

Because the sun is not up and the sky is not blue.

And I am not fucking normal like you.

The only light I can manifest today is that of the lightening.

I want to conjure up something ruinous. I want to be loud and reckless and unforgiving.

Instead, here I sit.

In the fog.

As I’ve so dutifully trained myself to do.

It’s boring. And annoying.

And truthfully I’m so absolutely sick of it I think I might just go to sleep until the sun decides to show up.

But hey!!

It’s better than the destruction that comes with what lies beyond the fog, right?

...Right?"
1198,When do i know its the right time for therapy?,"I've been going through depression for over a year now, it was followed with anxiety, panic and other stuff too. 

I always feel like the breakdown I just had was literally nothing once I'm better. I forgot about it. And next time its worse.

My main concern is that I feel like I'm exaggerating the whole thing. Although its been affecting my eating habits horribly, my grades, my relationship with my friends and family, my self-image and alot more.

I also really don't like the idea of meeting someone new, that not only is a total stranger, but can totally fuck up my mind if they want to. It terrifies me. 

I'm also very young (I'm 13) so..most people think ""yOuRe sO yOuNg yOu sTiLl dIdNt sEe tHe rEaL bAd sTuFf iN tHe wOrLd""

What makes me really want to get therapy, is that I had a horrible depressive episode (that's what I call it) and basically I thought it ended, I thought I'm better now. But I'm starting to feel bad again, and i don't wanna go thru the same thing again.so I'm really rushing."
1199,Sent my assignment to my tutor today and he said he would accept it as my draft and he needs it in report form. It's really got to me.,"I put days worth of work into my assignment and when  i got a reply saying ""good effort, I will accept this as your draft"", It really got to me because I put in as much as I can. It has triggered my depression because it's not good enough but it's the best I can do and now I'm anxious about the whole thing. The whole lockdown in the UK has made it harder because my course at college is a practical based course and exams are cancelled so the final grade is going to be based on predicted grades. I am so close to dropping out because I can't cope with all this change because of my Asperger's Syndrome. Only thing that keeps me going is I now have a few friends and that the course cost me over £11'000.

I really don't know what to do anymore. :("
1200,Ive returned to self harming after years of not doing so and I want to be dead. Help?,"I dont know what to do. Ive done what everyone in my life recommends. Taken all the advise, all the steps, all the medication, sought help. Why am I still like this? Im scared. I cant go on if its going to always circle back to this."
1201,How to find motivation and energy?,"Hey everyone,

I'm always coming up with cool ideas for projects to work on in my head, but whenever I want to actually work on them I either can't start or give up after a few days, just because I don't feel like I have the energy or determination to do so. I'm lethargic almost 24/7, a very good procrastinator and even though I'm passionate about the projects I want to work on, I just can't. For example, I have a book I've wanted to write for literally 3 years now. I haven't even got 2 pages done. Every time I pick up the pen or get on the google doc, I get hit with a wave of a lack of motivation and just go play video games or listen to music instead. Every single time. That's just one example out of tens of projects I've either given up on or haven't even started. Even on days where I wake up feeling motivated, I fall back into it when I actually try to do anything. It really annoys me because there's so much I wanna do, and I know once I finish something I'll be proud of it.

How do you guys find the energy and motivation to do things you want to? I really want to start and maybe even finish some of my projects this year, and it would mean the world to me if I could get some advice on how to pick my ass up and get going with them. I'm tired of never getting anything done."
1202,I am a manipulative person and I'm conflicted,"So to give some background as to what I think is the origin of my manipulative behavior; my father is a work horse engineer working in managerial positions over the past 25 years. He's relatively hands-off until he feels that enough time has passed since his last lecture, where he lectures me about my lack of motivation, lack of faith, lack of goals, etc. In school, I was a straight B+ student leading up to 10th grade, where my grades dipped into the B range because of my hatred for Calculus and not even trying. My father's response was basically psychological abuse; telling me that I'd grow up to become a garbage man, threatening to kick me out of the house if I didn't get my act together, etc. Which I took seriously and I improved my grades to almost A range, which obviously isn't good enough?

At the time, I didn't pay it much mind because I'm not the type of person who contemplates my own thoughts or how anyone treats me. So I developed a defense mechanism where I bury my negative experience deep down and basically forget them.

I genuinely don't think my father is a bad person, I'm sure he has my best interests in mind. But his methods are pretty much mental abuse. 

Sorry for the long background, but I first noticed being manipulative is when I basically developed a methodical way to subside his anger down as he's lecturing me over time even if I'm not convinced of what he's saying so I can slither away from him being angry for the rest of the day, but mostly because I think he's already got enough on his plate for me to add on to his stress from work.

As the years wore on, I noticed that I do this with some people as I portray myself as a forgetful person with the memory of a goldfish so that no one gets annoyed when I don't remember whatever useless things they're telling me. Another habit of mine is ""innocently"" surrender information that doesn't mean much to me, but might seem like a big deal to people as a way to make them drop their guard to me.

I've only ever used these methods for malicious reasons a handful of times for dumb reasons such as getting nudes (3 times) or let a girl put out earlier than she would (once). Sometimes I do it with no end goal or because I want anything from anyone.

I don't know what I am or what to do. But I know that in order to get better, I need to identify the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long essay, any feedback would be appreciated no matter your opinion.

Thanks"

1204,Haven’t showered in 6 days or been outside the house and barely eating.,"On New Year’s Eve I got suspended from work. I accidentally pocketed a coupon after scanning it. I had no idea I didn’t insert it. A few weeks later they are calling me into the office. Loss prevention is on the phone asking me why i did it and that technically that wasn’t  a good thing for me to do. I told them I don’t remember doing it but if I did it was unintentional. I’ve been suspended for 6 days now. The tape is going to be reviewed by the company And they will make a decision then call me. No one has called me yet. I think it’s taking so long because I’m a good person and would never “steal“anything(coupons are equivalent to cash). I’ve never been in trouble with the law or suspended from anything. I paid what the coupon was worth then they suspended me. In the case I guess patience is a virtue but when it’s your job on the line especially over a stupid coupon and it’s Covid so people are jobless and stuff it just makes me really emotional.  

Does anyone else have a similar story? What was the outcome? How did you motivate yourself to si anything?! 😔

1205,Question about empathy (need help please),"Of course, if my best friend died, or something, i would feel sad. However, when i imagine something along the lines of him experiencing a loss of a person who does not affect me, i cant say I would actually FEEL personal sadness. Of course, I would understand his situation and try to support him, however I cannot say I would personally feel a strong emotion because he lost someone. Additionally, I hear people saying phrases such as ""im so excited for you"" etc... do people actually get seriously personally excited for someone else's success? For instance, my friends say they are excited for me to get a gift, and they want to see it when its here etc. Is this just a thing people say as common courtesy or do people ACTUALLY feel PERSONAL excitement for someone else? I do not feel these things, such as feelings of personal sadness over someone elses loss, or personal excitement over someone elses gain. I don't feel jealousy or anything, but there is 0 emotion if even my friend loses something or gains something significant, and when i help them through things its because i feel i am supposed to, not because i actually have a genuine emotion connected to their experience. Is this normal? And the things people say are just courtesy and nobody actually feels these types of emotions? Or is there something off with me?"
1206,How to stop myself from building up a tolerance to Adderall?,"This is a long post because I give a lot of details for the best responses, so if you don't want to read all the way through I'll sum it up with a TL;DR at the end.

***Background:***  
I'm 17 and unfortunately have been diagnosed with a lot of mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, a binge eating disorder, and although it may be controversial to some, borderline personality disorder. These are all disorders I've struggled for a while with, and it's made my quality of life miserable. I've been suicidal, I've self harmed, I smoke weed and have done things with psyches, and currently am extremely low functioning.

It's to the point where the past three years by winter I've had to go to a mental hospital and almost failed school. This year isn't much of an exception, only I've managed to stay away from the mental hospital, but still getting by with the bare minimum. I can barely take care of myself, let alone do schoolwork and daily chores, so I sit around all day. 

I've been on a lot of medications in the past, mostly antidepressants and mood stabilizers, and barely had a reaction. For the first time a couple months ago, I was prescribed Adderall XR. The first things I was informed of was it's dangers of addiction and building up a tolerance to it. I have an addictive personality, so it scared me well. But it was so much help. I wasn't suddenly able to function like a normal human being, but there were many things that are a bare minimum of taking care of yourself that suddenly came with ease, which coming from where I am was wonderful. It gave me hope, so that every little basic chore didn't feel impossible. 

That all being said, I really want this medication to be able to help me. But I was scared off so much with the addiction and/or tolerance, that I take it once a week if even. You can imagine that my life has continued to be really difficult. Because of my mental health I switched back in October to online only school. Currently, I have a ridiculous amount of schoolwork due because while I might be able to get a small bit of schoolwork done on certain days, it's mostly just a big chunk everytime I take Adderall, which once again is sometimes not even once a day.

I can't get the intensive fear out of my head so much that I don't know how to properly limit myself. I'm at such a low point in my life, I don't want to start getting my shit together only to take a dive off the deep end when the medication stops working.

I don't want want to be reliant on a drug to function, but at the same time I've struggled to even want to live my life for the past 4 years and it hasn't gotten much better. I already go to therapy and have tried to do the most for my mental health. It's like a last resort, but I feel terrible about it. Anyone who has had similar situations or concerns, how can I deal with this?

***TL;DR:*** *Barely functioning doing the bare minimum in life, mostly unresponsive to most medications, but recently prescribed Adderall that works wonderfully. I'm deathly afraid of being too reliant and building up a tolerance, so I'm currently taking it not even once a week sometimes. How do I deal with this, as Adderall is like a last resort to me but I feel terrible about it? (Yes have tried other methods, currently attend a psychologist and psychiatrist)*"
1207,Cigarettes make me a horrible person (and I have never smoked),"Hi all, 

I need some help on aomething that has been plagueing me for a long time. 

When im around or near cigarettes its like this wave of anger, fear and hatred comes over me. I cant touch them. And i would refuse to associate with anyone who smokes.

I have absolutely no reason why i feel like this or what is wrong with me. I dont want to feel like this and im worried its going to come between me and my partner. She understands me(in general) but we both know its not nornal behavior and it shouldn't effect me in the way it does.

I should mention I have never smoked in my life and this also applies to any drugs/illegal substances.

Thank you"
1208,"I've been feeling very anxious lately, my studies haven't been going well, I'm behind a few years and I'm not sure I'm gonna pass my exam this term.","Hi all, 

This is just a vent/get my mind off it post, but feel free to comment how your feeling too, let's just talk it all out.

I was in med school, I say was because I didn't pass one of my exams and got kicked out for it, so I now have to rewrite the entrance exam. However it has been years since I studied high school level bio, chem and physics. And I don't remember shit. 
My dad just lost his job so I'm scared me falling behind again is gonna put more pressure on him. 

I'm also having some visa issues because of this whole covid and brexit issue. Basically everything seems to be falling apart and I'm trying so hard to stay strong but it's getting harder not to cry and keep my emotions in place. Yes I know I'll feel better if I cry, but I hate it, I always feel worse after a crying session.

Actually as I'm writing this, I'm starting to feel a bit better. Just more calm, I'll probably fall apart again tomorrow but that's life I guess. 

Please feel free to vent out your feelings in the comments, we all have to look out for each other during this shitty ass time."
1209,How to cultivate a happy mind when it’s not possible to change the circumstances of your current environment?,"I (23 F) won’t get into too much detail but the people I live with (grandparents) are very abusive - comes in the form of picking out flaws, or “joking” about insecurities, constantly watching and critiquing my every step, following me and my sister around not respecting boundaries or privacy. It’s almost impossible for me to be positive about other things in my life when I’m around these people, however I have no other family to live with and my current wages won’t allow me to move out for at least another year. I’ve been moved back and forth from my father and between places all my life pretty much and recently moved back here about a year and a few months ago. The rollercoaster of emotions I’ve had in myself from being around these people are insane, it’s been like it my entire life from them but now I’m getting older I really don’t have the patience for it, or when I do I feel like I’m insane or it’s making me behave not very nicely towards myself. I dissociate frequently and Have other adverse psychological reactions due to trauma and the verbal abuse from them constantly is making it impossible for me to manage these issues and have effective relationships with people outside the home, I end up isolating myself from others because I feel drained. All this on top of work, pandemic etc. I just feel at a loss with what to do, is anyone going through a similar experience?"

1217,I might be about to have three weeks of distance learning and I feel like I’m losing it,"So actually it’s not that bad yet, because I’m trying to stay calm and enjoy the last days of our extended holidays. 

Our government just decided to keep schools closed. And it’s obvious that they will do some sort of lessons. Most likely distance learning, because what else would you do? 

Last time we had that, I was not feeling good at all. It often makes me want to drop out of school (which is legally okay and I also already have some sort of certificate. Most people have it, it’s not bad (don’t know the English equivalent though)) because it stresses me out extremely. I won’t do most of the tasks, pay little attention to the calls our teachers make with us and learn 0 stuff. I’m generally very unmotivated to do anything at school. But in distance learning there’s no pressure like a teacher standing at front, saying we should work. It’s all in your own responsibility. And lately that’s something I don’t have if it comes to school. 

That’s because the certificate I have is alright, good grades etc. and I’m currently doing a higher one, but I realized I’ll probably fail because of maths. I feel like I wasted all my life and made the worst decision in my life. It’s over. I feel like I can’t go back. I’ll either get the certificate or die trying. But I won’t get it, because I suck. 


I wanted to do therapy because of quite a lot of stuff. Fear of commitment. I’m always stressed. Some sort of social anxiety that makes school so much worse. Etc. But I don’t know when on earth I’m supposed to do that. My mum said I should take a year off and focus on getting myself “put together” if that’s how you can call it, but then I’d have to repeat the year. I’m the oldest there (2-3 years older than everyone). If I repeat, I’ll be even older. I don’t want that. 

What do I do about all of this? How do I get motivated for school again? And how do I make time for a therapy? Any suggestions? 

Thanks in advance"
1218,"Is it right for someone to be completely dependent on antidepressants to help them? If not, what else should be done?",My boyfriend’s sister always reminds him that his mental illness is who he is by asking him if he has taken his medication or not when he gets angry or upset at things and I don’t think it’s right. I don’t see much changes in his mood even despite being on medication so does that mean he needs to increase his dosage or he needs to be willing to change himself? From what I see is that to change one must be willing to change. It’s takes the very first step or realization that you need helps and willing to try to be committed to it. Correct me if I am wrong please.
1219,Anyone know what this is called?,"Often times when I’m with a group of people I get intrusive thoughts regarding the flow of the conversation. I know that if I say nothing, the conversation will continue as is and develop naturally. I know that I have the power to say any number of starters to completely twist and change the entire topic and tone of the conversation but I can never determine if I should speak or let it flow naturally. It’s hard to explain but I know if I’m quiet, someone in the group will say something completely out of the blue and start the conversation and I feel like I’m sort of robbing them from that opportunity by not allowing them the time to do so. 

TLDR: I get intrusive thoughts about the flow of conversations. Is there a name for this?"
1220,I think I may have been misdiagnosed,"Okay, let me explain my situation. I (17f) was diagnosed with clinical depression a few years ago, and for the record, I do fit enough of the symptoms that I could be right. It's hard for me to complete tasks, I feel numb/disconnected from reality a lot, I find myself zoning out a lot, I feel like I'm sort of on autopilot sometimes and can't actually control my actions (I didn't explain that well but hopefully you get the gist), I have executive function issues and get overwhelmed and hypersensitive to touch and noise easily, and just have general motivation issues, which was essentially what made my doctor diagnose me with depression. Makes sense right? I even have a genetic variant thing (MTHFR) that directly causes anxiety/depression (I've been diagnosed with both, but I think the anxiety one is right). So, me having depression would make sense.

However, I think I made a detrimental error in the process of being diagnosed. My doctor asked me if I was dealing with emotional or focus related issues, and I didn't think about it and answered emotional, because the number one symptom I had actually picked up on - and wasn't blaming on something else, like general laziness or something- was feeling numb. Numb isn't quite the right word, it's more like vaguely dissociated, and honestly I hardly ever feel that way anymore anyway, but I definitely did at the time. My doctor, because of how easy it was for me to answer, ruled out all focus related issues. Based on my symptoms, I think the correct diagnosis should be ADHD (and for the record, my dopamine levels are just as fucked as my serotonin ones, so this medically checks out). I also think me being a good student and considered very intelligent from a young age may have led to this being ruled out as well. Good news though, I am going to start seeing a therapist soon (I was seeing one like a year ago but quit because we weren't working well, and just agreed to try again), so I'm hoping I can talk to her about it.

Here's where y'all come in: can someone who is a medical professional and sees this PLEASE explain the difference between depression and ADHD in the comments. I am NOT asking for y'all to try to diagnose me, nor do I want advice or opinions on my situation. I just want someone to explain how they look similar, but what symptoms do not overlap and how a profession tells the difference (particularly for ADHD inattentive type). I've already done some reading, but I would like someone who knows a fair amount about both. I want to make sure that I'm correct, or at least on to something by thinking I may have been diagnosed, but a lot of the stereotypes/signs of ADHD, which is what a lot of my attempts to google have lead to, do not apply because I'm not hyperactive at all and I actually do well in school. I'm hoping that if I can get a proper explanation of how the two differ, from a medical professional, I can not only ""self diagnose"" (only very temporarily) so that I know if it's worthy talking to my doctor/therapist to see if they agree I had a misdiagnosis, but also create a better case to convince my mother who, when I merely proposed the idea that I may have ADHD, shut it down immediately saying that there was no was because my doctor hadn't ever considered it a possibility. So yeah, if anyone could take the time to explain how their differences and how they overlap and how a professional would tell the difference, stuff like that, I would greatly appreciate it."

I actually kinda want to go, like I need a break from life. But hear people say they are afraid of going to a hospital, so what if I’m faking this for attention."
1223,I think I may have been misdiagnosed,"Okay, let me explain my situation. I (17f) was diagnosed with clinical depression a few years ago, and for the record, I do fit enough of the symptoms that I could be right. It's hard for me to complete tasks, I feel numb/disconnected from reality a lot, I find myself zoning out a lot, I feel like I'm sort of on autopilot sometimes and can't actually control my actions (I didn't explain that well but hopefully you get the gist), I have executive function issues and get overwhelmed and hypersensitive to touch and noise easily, and just have general motivation issues, which was essentially what made my doctor diagnose me with depression. Makes sense right? I even have a genetic variant thing (MTHFR) that directly causes anxiety/depression (I've been diagnosed with both, but I think the anxiety one is right). So, me having depression would make sense.

However, I think I made a detrimental error in the process of being diagnosed. My doctor asked me if I was dealing with emotional or focus related issues, and I didn't think about it and answered emotional, because the number one symptom I had actually picked up on - and wasn't blaming on something else, like general laziness or something- was feeling numb. Numb isn't quite the right word, it's more like vaguely dissociated, and honestly I hardly ever feel that way anymore anyway, but I definitely did at the time. My doctor, because of how easy it was for me to answer, ruled out all focus related issues. Based on my symptoms, I think the correct diagnosis should be ADHD (and for the record, my dopamine levels are just as fucked as my serotonin ones, so this medically checks out). I also think me being a good student and considered very intelligent from a young age may have led to this being ruled out as well. Good news though, I am going to start seeing a therapist soon (I was seeing one like a year ago but quit because we weren't working well, and just agreed to try again), so I'm hoping I can talk to her about it.

Here's where y'all come in: can someone who is a medical professional and sees this PLEASE explain the difference between depression and ADHD in the comments. I am NOT asking for y'all to try to diagnose me, nor do I want advice or opinions on my situation. I just want someone to explain how they look similar, but what symptoms do not overlap and how a profession tells the difference (particularly for ADHD inattentive type). I've already done some reading, but I would like someone who knows a fair amount about both. I want to make sure that I'm correct, or at least on to something by thinking I may have been diagnosed, but a lot of the stereotypes/signs of ADHD, which is what a lot of my attempts to google have lead to, do not apply because I'm not hyperactive at all and I actually do well in school. I'm hoping that if I can get a proper explanation of how the two differ, from a medical professional, I can not only ""self diagnose"" (only very temporarily) so that I know if I actually could have ADHD, and so I know if it's worthy talking to my doctor/therapist to see if they agree I had a misdiagnosis, but also create a better case to convince my mother who, when I merely proposed the idea that I may have ADHD, shut it down immediately saying that there was no was because my doctor hadn't ever considered it a possibility. So yeah, if anyone could take the time to explain how their differences and how they overlap and how a professional would tell the difference, stuff like that, I would greatly appreciate it."
1224,Any tips for coping with adjustment disorder?,
1225,I can’t live like this anymore,"
I’ve always dealt with anxiety, and some unexplainable sadness that just consumed me at all times. Things got better my junior and senior year of high school, I was genuinely happy. Then I started university in a foreign country. First my anxiety came back, since I had to meet new people and also speak in a foreign language 24/7. I was and still am very insecure about my accent and that was my biggest problem. But I was still happy, since this was something I believed to be what I wanted. Then I met a guy. For the first time in my life I have liked someone, and felt like I could trust someone. He was my first kiss and just overall he meant and still means a lot to me. My anxiety and sadness started coming back. Living in a foreign country was hard, I could not understand the mentality of everyone around me, and there were a lot of cultural misunderstandings that were making my life harder and harder. The guy I fell in love with broke my heart. He lead me on and lied to me, I can’t get into it rn, but after this I just completely crashed. I felt completely alone, my anxiety became unbearable and all I could think of is that I want to disappear. It’s been a couple of months but I am not getting better. Whenever I think about what has happened I keep bursting in tears, and I can’t stop thinking about it, I feel like my head is going to explode. I just can’t do this anymore, I’m just so sad and broken, and I want at least one nice thing to happen to me."
1226,I just booked my first counselling appointment. What can I expect? What should I do to prepare?,"Hi all,

My College offers free counselling (via phone due to COVID). I've been thinking about trying it for years but I decided to finally give it a go.

I'm really nervous because I don't really know where to begin/what to expect. I have struggled with my mental health for my whole life but have never really opened up to people/seen a professional.

What are some things I should do before the appointment? Should I write down talking points? Questions? I don't really know what to do - I just know that I need some type of help.

Any advice and pointers would be great. 

Thank you so much."

1229,How can I not compare myself? F14,"How am I not supposed to compare myself to other girls. I look like I am fucking slender-man. I am tall, CONSTANTLY told that I am too skinny, and I am flat. My face is ugly especially my nose. The only guys that ever give me attention just want nudes or want to use me. I never wear the right clothes, I have scoliosis like a fucking stegosaurus, and my teeth are yellow! I get told that I suck at makeup to stop trying all the time because it’s much too cakes or there’s always something wrong with it. I have acne all over my face. I have stretch marks all over my body. I have a shifty family that hates me and I hate them. I’m not sure if I’m gay or straight.

1231,Pandemic is making me lose control over my own mind.,"I most certainly hope this is where to ask after so many friends told me to go here.
Sorry if the flair is wrong, I didn't know weather to choose Need Support or Inspiration/Encouragement or venting as it's kinda all.

Anyway.

Before the pandemic, I just started seeing people after being alone, confused, friendless and depressed frpm birth till right before it happened, when I started to attend a college to become social and learn to be an actual part of the world, but as I got some friends, and started to get on track, came the biggest Chinese-goverment dick move of the century, ignoring a citizen who discovered a deadly Virus, which then became a pandemic.

This shaddered me.

I was fine at first.

Then, during the second half of the 2020 summer break, I was told I got paranoia to the extreme.

I already have anxiety.

Now, with countless panic attacks and false feelings of threat, I got the loneliness back.

I can't see anyone.

Those I can are never available.

This made me sad.

I don't think I'm depressed yet.

I'm now a Satanist believing there is only Hell.
My family tries to convince me otherwise.
Nope.

God is dead. The goat man is the only hope.

Not only that, but I'm getting suicidal.
But It's not just self-healing thoughts.
I've been having murderous thought and intentions.
No actions yet 
I'm becoming blood thirsty because people don't give a fuck about jack-shit making the world all the worse.

Sometimes I just go on a murder spree in my mind for hours that feels like minutes, not realizing I've starred at a wall for several hours irl.

I zone out constantly.

I get angry for hours and completely forget what happened after getting angry other than getting angry when it's over.

I feel like I'm becoming a zombie.

I'm losing myself.

I have a surprisingly increased amount of monologues with objects and fictional characters in my head as well.

I feel like I'm fading and someone else is taking over my mind.

How the fuck do I stop this?

I wanna go back to being normal, happy, and friendly with a smile.

I can't take this anymore.

How can I regain control over my own consciousness?

Please. Please."
1232,I can’t cry,I’ve noticed recently that i seem to be just unable to cry. The last time I remember crying was when my mum was diagnosed with cancer which makes sense because it was an incredible emotional time but since then there have been times where I feel like I really need to cry and I try to but nothing comes out and there is no emotional outlet. My upbringing has been good and imo not too toxically masculine but in my family it is 4 boys and then my mum so it could be that. Lately I’ve been anxious and stressed about a lot of things and feel like a cry now or then would help a lot so anybody have any idea on how to remedy this?
1233,Cant stop ruminative thinking / I'm scared to change?," 

No  matter how much I try to stop and tell myself good things it always comes back. I'm losing sleep and not hungry. It seems to happen no  matter what is going on with my life but gets so so bad when something  is happening. 

I don't have any hobbies I only really watch TV and  play video games on my spare time when I'm not working at my full time office job - that I don't really like and also constantly get distracted at - and these aren't enough. I'm not  interested in doing anything. I feel like its my fault that I can't  change because I'm not trying hard enough. I constantly try to distract  myself but always go back because its so easy like my mind feels normal  in a distressed state. I keep trying to search solutions to stop but I  feel like I don't care enough to try. I am so tired of being like this  but it feels so hard to get out of it. 

On the weekends I always end up  drinking and partying and do reckless things because it feels like the  only distraction is if I get black out drunk and then feel so much worse  the next day. If I don't drink it just feels like a weekday, because  after work every day I go home and try to distract myself with the  TV/Video Games, cleaning, etc and it just never goes away. 

I also have this weird feeling when I get myself to stop like something bad is going to happen. I think I'm worried If i don't think and worry as much as I do that I will handle situations the wrong way but I feel like I do that anyways... But just for the stuff that bothers me. For everything else I don't care about I don't ruminate and I feel confident in these things. For some reason my brain won't make the connection that I might feel confident in the situations I ruminate about if I Stop.

I feel like I can't interact normally with certain people that I ruminate about and it ruins my relationships with anybody I have feelings for. I obsess how I act/talk around them and fantasize in my head and replay events and it makes me act in ways i normally wouldn't and makes me forget what my personality is and who I really am. Thankfully I don't do this with my friends.

Maybe  it is better sometimes. I can't really remember because I am going  through something right now and its especially bad and I'm feeling  really hopeless. This has been going on for years,"

1235,How the fuck do I stop shutting down and clamming up entirely?,"I can’t even think about opening up to someone without, completely shutting down and just the thought of it triggers my anxiety.

This shit was caused in part by my parents (mostly my dad) and just getting attacked as a kid for showing emotions or talking about the way i feel."
1236,Insicure about my medication.,"Hi, so i am autistic and have ADHD . 
I'll go straight to the point. 
Despite my medication have been very useful for my anxiety the did almost nothing to my concentration , and my , let's say ""Typical ADHD Behaviours"".
So this is a period ib whic i need a lot of concentration for my studies. I have confronted my therapist before , but i have been said that i don't need stronger medication , and that the actual medication i taken is also a little bit useful for concentration.
I take xanax , which is for anxiety, and sertralin, that is for depression , they told me that have a little effect on my anxiety too. But really that does not work. Especially in this period of pandemic since i relied heavenly on the ""social pressure"" of people around me to study , and despite i went well with the studies at first more focus was required , and i litteraly broke.

Now for concentration the let me use a new experimental technique,  ( and i must say the results were preety good). But i don't feel this is not enough.

I understand that i am followed by one of the best in my country. But i think i should at least have the right to try some medication and see how it goes?

Sorry for potato english , but its late in my country and i really need help. Thank you"
1237,Why does my anxiety get worse in the winter?,Every year at the end of October my anxiety becomes really bad. This started happening in 2017. I always feel like shit because I always end up ruining me and my family’s holidays because I’m to worried to do anything. My family and friends just say “oh your just nervous.” But I’m not nervous I just “mentally shut down” to the point where I can’t do anything. When I get anxiety I always get warm around my chest and my thighs. I am currently on anxiety meds but I don’t see much of an improvement...
1238,Looking for Writers who Want to Embarrass Themselves!,"Hello all,

My name is Ethan Fisher-Perez, I'm a first-year Neuroscience student in college, and I am trying to get a multi-platform mental health service called Above Cognition off the ground.

On my website, I plan to host the experiences of people with various mental health issues, which is why I've come looking for writers. If you've been diagnosed with either Depression, Bipolar Disorder, an Eating Disorder, or an Anxiety Disorder, and have a keen interest in writing about your experiences to help others, please let me know!

Writing about yourself can provide you with relief and understanding, and every post has the potential to help someone avoid what you've been through and provide them temporary and long-term relief.

This is a relatively small venture for now, but I don't plan on stopping any time soon. If you're interested in being part of something I believe could be important for many and bolster your resume with an entrepreneurial venture, I'd love to hear from you.

&amp;#x200B;

Please check us out to see if we're right for you!

Website link: [https://abovecognition.com/](https://abovecognition.com/)

Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/above\_cognition/](https://www.instagram.com/above_cognition/)

&amp;#x200B;

I want Above Cognition to be a congregation of the experiences of people who have known internal strife, because I remember five years ago, when I was coming to terms with my Anxiety, I always felt better when I saw or read of someone who thought like me. I would love your voice to be part of that."
1239,Self harm,"I’ve never seen why self harm mattered to others. Over the past decade I’ve gained the control to not “dangerously “ harm myself. Why does it matter to others that I do this? It’s the only thing that keep me from ending everything. It doesn’t actually hurt anyone else, why can’t I just deal with me pain in the way that makes sense to me?"
1240,Some stuff that helped me with anxiety and depression,"First post here, sharing in case there are things that help - especially for those in UK (like me) going back into a full lockdown now...

My story: suffered through a period of relatively intense anxiety and depression in 2020 as a result of being way out of my comfort zone at work.  Won’t go into details here, but all much better now.

Wanted to share some things that have helped me, and have divided them into things that helped immediately, and things that have been a slower burn, but are paying off now.

Quick fixes:

1.  Talking to other people - can’t be said enough. The very act of sharing thoughts and problems with those I trusted helped, and they were able to help me see that my brain was hijacking my thoughts somewhat

2.  Exercise - no matter how relaxed / strenuous it was, a bit of exercise, getting out of the house for a walk say, helped clear my head a little and give me some space away from negative thoughts 

3.  Cutting out Alcohol - hard as it was to remove this crutch, it helped pretty instantly not having any alcohol-induced hangovers to deal with on top of my negative emotions 

Medium-term efforts:

1.  Therapy - I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to access sessions with a clinical psychologist through a healthcare plan, and a lm going through a course of Schema therapy (a form of CBT). I’m 12 sessions in (once a week), and it’s helping me to unpick some of the emotional underpinning of my issues and to lay out strategies for dealing with them if they resurface 

2.  Mindfulness meditation - I’ve used Headspace pretty consistently for the last 5 months, and have really noticed a difference in how I perceive the world in the last 2.  I find that it helps me to get a bit more time between feeling an emotion and reacting to it, and sometimes I’m able to step in in that gap and stop myself from being swept up in a feeling. 

3.  Journaling focusing on gratitude - I’ve been following a simple-ish structure for daily journaling that I lifted from a Tim Ferris book:  each morning I list out 4 things I’m grateful for, 3 things that would “make today great” and 3 positive affirmations. Then in the evening (or more often, the next morning before listing the above, I list out 3 amazing things that happened in the day, and up to 3 things I could have done to improve the day.  What I’ve noticed is that over time, it’s gotten easier and easier to come up with amazing things, and I’m noticing more and more small things that go my way throughout life I feel grateful for.  It’s taken 3 months or so to get to that place with the exercise, but it’s really powerful for me now.

Longer term:  I’m just starting out on some of this now, grateful for any thoughts!  One thing I’m trying is sharing my story a bit more (which this post is part of), but other than that, I’m open to suggestions.

Good luck out there."
1241,A quick vent - willing to get off chest to feel some personal relief,"\*\*NOT SUICIDAL, NON VIOLENT (NO CUTTING, NO SELF PAIN), JUST STRESSED\*\*

I'm being going on a downwards spiral since around November 13th and I haven't had a real good day since November 11th, I feel like I'm losing it, I wish I could get back to my glory days where I was the better me, not the ""I lost myself"" me.

\- It feels like I developed slight paranoia since whenever I'm not in a group setting, I feel like they're talking shit about me (like oh fuck him or he's so annoying/weird, I wish I wasn't his friend) when in reality nothing's happening and I can't get the positive situations in my head to filter out the negativity.

\- I'm worrying too much, back in January 2020, I was never worried, I had the greatest confidence you've ever seen, then starting suddenly around mid March 2020, I just lost it, I got really worried a lot and felt out of it for no reason, like one moment I could be feeling clean the next moment I'm worried for no reason at all, it just ruins my flow knowing that one simple thought of worry ruins my day.

\- Twice so far (once got over amazingly, one of the best moments of 2020), I got/get paranoid when I hear these people's names, first time was around June 2020, I once mumbled the name and after that I couldn't get it out of my system until around September 15th 2020, over that time I had to partially change my speech flow, rarely go outside since I felt like I could just burst the name out and I'll feel embarrased whenever they were around, it was the worst 2 and a half months in a long time, luckily it dissapeared randomly. Second one same story, randomly mumbled it once, can't get it out, I've gotten paranoid of saying the name since I feel like they could be near by and they could get humiliated which I will feel down about. Seriously trying to get it out of my system but it's gonna be a hard one. I tried to apologize twice incase I did anything weird in general without noticing cause I feel that bad.

\- I lost my self. Here's an example, back in January - February 2020 and September - October 2020, I was the greatest person ever, had an insane charm, wooed a few, a wickedly good humour and was bubbly. Then came now, I lost myself, I'm no longer the greatest person ever, I act different, the charm just dissapeared randomly, I feel like I'm the ""oh, it's him person"", people who haven't seen me in a while probably noticed ""what the hell happened to him"", I no longer am bubbly, just very reserved and ""to self"", and the humour now is just plain average, not Jim Carrey level. My mind was like one day ""you know what, let's lose the things that made me feel good"", it just happened out of nowhere.

\- I feel like such a fool to everyone, like all of the smiles and all of the general kindness seem like it's ""forced"" to make me ""feel good about myself"" when in reality they deeply dislike me and think I'm a fool or is it just my mind playing tricks on me and they don't hate me.

1242,Should I see a therapist?,"I don’t really know where to start with this. I’m 15, a laddie, and like most people in the US I’ve been in lockdown for the past 3/4ths year.

I genuinely don’t know what I like or who I like anymore. There’s who I am most the time, this happy and charismatic bubbly person who laughs at almost every joke and genuinely had a passion for everything, and then there’s how I’m feeling now. The truth is, all I feel is sick, vile, depressed, and like I’ve wasted all my time the last few years making relationships that this part of me is saying I never cared for at all. but I don’t really think that’s true. I’ve loved being around these people for going on 2 years now, but now I feel like I was just lying to myself.

I know I could afford more detail and I’d be happy to provide it, but that’s the king and short of it. I know the last 2 years of my life were spent being genuinely happy, but now everything in my body is telling me otherwise. Any kind of response at all is appreciated, I just want to know what this brick in my chest and void in my stomach mean."

Some background: I live with my mom and I am unemployed due to my mental health. When I asked her why she does this, she just told me she's afraid I'm going to try to overdose. Mind you, I've had suicidal thoughts in the past, but I have never once  attempted to take my life. I've never even had a plan of action. I don't understand why she wouldn't trust me like that. Lately I've been stressed out so I had some high anxiety today and I looked all over for my meds before finally finding them hidden in a drawer. This is pissing me off. I've tried talking to her about it before but she continues to hide them. What should I do?"
1245,I want to die so bad. I know if I starve myself more my heart will eventually fail &amp; I want that.,just saying anonymously my guilty confessions idk what i'm doing... I'm so tired. I quit. I hope I die already.
1246,I haven’t felt like anything is real for 5 days,"I’ve never had this issue before, or if I have it’s been really mild, but ever since Jan 1st, nothing has felt real. Logically, I know that the world I’m living in is real, but it just feels like I’m living in a weird dreamlike state, almost like I’m watching a movie through my own eyes. I experience visual disturbances too, where some things seem bigger or closer than they are, and others seem smaller or further away. And the world looks synthetic, almost plasticey, even when the visual disturbances calm down a bit. I don’t know what to do, I did a telehealth visit who ordered me a covid test and told me to see an in-person doctor if the test was negative and I still don’t feel better. I want to feel like myself again, it’s terrifying to be around your family and coworkers and feel like they aren’t real, and I want this to end so badly. I just want to feel normal again, and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been hydrating, getting good sleep, trying not to drink caffeine, but so far I’ve just been getting worse.

1247,Why am I like this?,"Wanted to die since I was a little kid; repeated ""I want to go home, I want to go home,"" for hours as a toddler. Selective mute until elementary school. Dad was gone during most of my childhood (in and out of mental health treatment facilities) and mom was overwhelmed with my younger siblings. I used to attack people and steal things and I still have trouble with compulsive lying. Diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and then did a crime that lead to being diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 14, and now I'm told that 14 is too young to be diagnosed so I must have something else wrong with me.

I'm stupid. I had to do alternate class scheduling to finish high school because I'd scream at my teachers or start crying if I got overwhelmed. I couldn't even make it through two semesters of college before giving up completely. And I feel like my parents have given up on me, too.

I'm 21 and finally control myself enough to keep a full-time job (only two times had to leave early due to fighting at customers) but I have no idea how to make friends. I have pushed myself away from everyone and it makes me angry when people try to reach out again. All I know how to do is upset people and honestly, I kinda enjoy the attention it gets me.

About a year ago I did something terrible that I can't admit to online and it's haunted me since then. I cannot tell anyone but it just keeps repeating in my head that I'm a bad bad bad person. I'm not supposed to be here. I don't deserve to be here. My life is not good and I just don't know anything else."

1250,What is this horrible feeling,"It's like I'm always flying away, fighting to stay in the present. I'm always worrying if I'll ever have a future being like this. No focus, no concentration, no memory. But I don't feel like I'm stupid but it also feels like something is making me this way. The other morning, I was looking at my leg and it didn't feel or look like it was mine. I've always been this way, at least since I was about 10 years old. When I was about 13, there was this long stick thing with a yellow thing on top. I had stared at it over the course of about a week, because I would sit out in the backyard with my mother, as she smoked her cigarettes. One day, I finally asked her what that thing was, and she told me, while laughing that it was a mop. Like it was so obvious and she went on to make a joke of it, like housework and chores were so ""foreign"" to me that I didn't even know what a mop was. EVERYTHING feels foreign come to think of it! Even my own body. Anyone else feel this way or even know what this feeling is? Maybe this is what people mean by psychosis? I don't know. Anyway, apologies for rambling, never mentioned this feeling to anyone and I guess I hit a nerve with myself."

One personality is rational, ambitious, ascetic and cold to others, the other one is idealistic, creative, materialistic and open to others. And their distinct personalities tend to direct me in EVERYTHING I do...

1253,FUCK THIS BULLSHIT STORY FUUUCCCKKK,"okay, I'm trying to make a story about mental health. Loneliness, social anxiety, and avoiding people. But I swear to fucking god. You know how many times I've redone this story over and over. I have the scene perfectly in my head. But writing it is so fucking hard. 
I keep rewriting and rewriting I want there to be a mood but i cant capture it at all. And its come to a point where I feel like the more I try the worse it becomes.

The saddest thing of all is that I want to have something really meaningful but I just cant write it. Fuck me. Fuck everything. I'm maybe a perfectionist but I want it to be right, not perfect. 

Idk if theres any writers on here but it hear that you should just write as you go but holy shit does it really bother me. I want to actually cry it hurts so much. I want to try again but what if it become worse? It's like an endless cycle. 

FUUUUUCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK"
1254,Where to get diagnosis?,I just started seeing a therapist recently by reaching out directly to them. Other than that I have not seen/talked to anyone about my mental health. I’m wondering how people usually get diagnosed? I don’t think my therapist is qualified to diagnose. Would I make an appointment directly with a psychiatrist? Or someone else?
1255,DAE downplay their struggles?,"I just want to get it over with, so I could stop feeling this way. I'm worried that the psychiatrist might dismiss me because I'm not ""bad"" enough. I'm doubting myself and asking if I am truly struggling with trauma like wtf. It's not like I don't know that I'm struggling so much, but my mind is telling me that I'm not struggling that bad, that other people have it worse and that I don't need help, because I can overcome this on my own. I just need to forget. 

and then just awhile ago, I had an anxiety attack, a flashback and a strong urge to self-harm again, but I still downplay everything. This sucks. fml. I wanna scream."
1256,Talking to my mom about my mental health,"
So a bit of background I 15m have been dealing with thoughts and feelings of self harm, suicide, depression and anxiety. Most of the time I’m actually happy and numb or neutral or something but I still struggle with those things though. I stay in my room most of the day but every time my parents ask if I’m okay I tell them I don’t want to talk about it cause I don’t I think they might not understand and I get super emotional when I open up about that stuff. But one day I decided to talk to my mom about it and I said “I thought y’all could tell that I’m not okay” because they know that I’ve dealt with mental health issues and she said “If you would come out of your room more maybe we would know” I kinda agree with that but I never said that I stopped having these struggles but then I said “Well I’m talking about it now” and at some point and I haven’t even gotten far into talking she told me “Do (whatever chores she said) then we’ll talk about it” So I got pissed and did the chores and didn’t even go back to talk to her about it and she never said anything to me about it at least that I noticed. But I also want to say my mom can act ridiculous sometimes like just irrational and stuff but she’s not a bad person sure she has flaws but everyone does. So am I the asshole?"
1257,how to deal with the feeling that i don’t feel “bad enough” to be taken seriously?,"Hi, I’m 16f, i think I might be bipolar. I won’t get into it too much, but logically I have literally absolutely the BIGGEST red flags and everything pointing towards the fact that I likely am. Have multiple first and second degree family members who are also bipolar. To summarize: it is absolutely not a far fetched concern

DESPITE all my logic yelling at me to get help, I absolutely cannot make myself. I feel as though it’s not serious enough yet as to where I should be taken seriously, I’m scared I’m making it up, I don’t want to worry my parents for nothing, and I keep convincing myself that I’m just being dramatic. I am literally walking around hoping that I will get way worse and have something terrible happen, so that I will have an excuse to get help. 

I know this is illogical but i don’t know what to do about it. The thought of talking to my parents genuinely makes me nauseous - though am also scared they won’t take me seriously. They have issues they’re literally getting treated for, but won’t acknowledge, it’s a complicated issue. Anyway. I really don’t know what to do. I feel so stupid, and I almost don’t really want to go to the doctor because I’m scared. Due to the family I’ve grown up in i also have NO idea what is “normal”, and I don’t know how bad it is. I’m really scared I’m overreacting but at the same time I just don’t feel well - but I don’t believe that I don’t, if that makes sense. 

I know there is a point blank answer to this and it is simply “tell your parents or go to the doctor” but I can’t. Do you have any advice? Or just any kind words, I don’t really know and am a little desperate maybe. I don’t know what the specific point of this post is, anything. Hope that’s allowed. &lt;3"
1258,"Seeking a professional in Cle Elum, Wa","Hello all, as the school quarter begins, and the winter continues relentlessly, a friend of mine is struggling with anxiety. She is a self-employed student and has often struggled with anxiety, however she is more concerned now because she does not have insurance, and she is worried about doing well in her classes. 

Anyways, she recently used SAMHSA to locate a professional, and the only professional in her area of Cle Elum lists depression treatment, not anxiety. Being restricted to this area, at least during the winter, would a health professional specializing in depression be able to help her with her anxiety? To me I see the two as affecting one another. For example, being anxious about schoolwork constantly would make me struggle in a class, leading to depressive thoughts. 

Thank you for your assistance, and I wish everyone the best."
1259,Can I tell my therapist about being groomed?,"I’m still a minor and I really don’t want to have to talk to my parents about being groomed and Ik that therapists have to disclose some information to the parents. 

It isn’t still happening, can I talk about it with my therapist without her being forced to tell my parents or someone else. 

Also would it be possible for her to force me to take legal action? I don’t want that it’s very stressful."
1260,I was separated at a hospital from everyone,"So like a little background when I was like 5 or so I was raped by a ""friend"" (she was like 7 years older than me) and her mom, and when I told someone this I was in foster care so the next day I was removed and put into a mental hospital I think. 

About a month of being there I was told I had to stay about 25 feet away from everyone who was a patient and I did. It got really hard to do later because everyone started to do all these activities that were really fun looking but I had to sit there and watch. 

I just really wanna know if it is normal because it has really messed with me and made me feel terrible even after 11 years.

I'm sorry if it doesn't belong here but it's been really messing with me."
1261,Is there something wrong with me?,"I have no attachment to anyone around me, including myself. It’s like I don’t love anyone, and I tell myself to feel guilty for it sometimes- mainly towards my family. Like my mum is so sweet and I know she loves me but I don’t genuinely love her and I only say I do out of obligation. I’m crying thinking about this because, no matter what, she and everyone close to me feel so distant like they’re strangers and I can’t do anything to feel any closer. 

Also, I don’t really know anyone around me at all so it’s no surprise I find myself thinking of everyone as 2D people. Maybe I do know them idk. Most of the time I just feel like I’m on autopilot or I’m a little ghost watching over my body get through the day, so conversations with people never go the way I wish they would. Everything about my character seems so disingenuous and it’s so difficult to control. I can’t remember a single time where I felt like I genuinely talked to anyone. I just never seem to be there. 
What’s worse is that my friend group who I’ve known for years are now constant company in my head so it feels like they’re still finalist people but I haven’t actually seen them in months (almost a year now). I forget that those aren’t people that exist in my life now but the many scenarios where they’re still around confuse me. 

Thing is it’s in my head too. I get so caught up in my fantasies all day, it feels like I can’t even be genuine to myself. It’s almost always been like this though so I don’t know why the way I am has started to bother me in recent months. 

I know this was far too long and more of a rant than anything but I’ve already written this all out so I’ll post anyways."
1262,Intense Perfectionism???,"I’ve noticed something about myself that has plagued me literally my entire life, and I’m in the process of figuring out with a mental health professional what actually is going on here.

My whole life, I would do the most minor things wrong (spill tea, not be able to do a math problem, not know the answer to something, say something stupid) and it puts me on the verge of a complete mental breakdown. It’s like I can’t handle failing in any sort of way, it’s like I can’t even *function* anymore if it means I make the most minor mistake!!!!  For a while I would even feel like jumping off a cliff over just making simple mistakes.

I’ve been like this since I was as young as 7, and this hypersensitivity has followed me for many years. Ive been in therapy for a while, I do the coping mechanisms, but the breakdowns over being imperfect feel so physical, no matter what I do. I’ve been wondering if maybe I’m on some sort of spectrum (ADHD, ASD???) but most of all, I just feel so alone.

Has anyone struggled with this same thing? Did you ever find out what this stemmed from??? It feels like my level of sensitivity towards mistakes  will follow me if I can’t overcome this. I can’t get through life this way, or anything I want to improve in, for that matter."
1263,Illness anxiety disorder,"I believe my husband has illness anxiety disorder, mainly toward mental health which makes it all the more harder to support him and encourage him to seek appropriate help. He has always had mild health anxiety but it has not affected him too much as he is able to feel when sickness symptoms dissipate and can move on.

He has been loosely diagnosed with anxiety (via one of those paper quizzes) and has been on anti depressants for years. Despite this, his fear of being mentally ill has only gotten worse and every time he seeks help it only solidifies the mental illnesses he is scared of getting, as he fixates on them and portrays the symptoms of said illnesses. Health professionals have never delved deeper. 

I understand this seems like a very vague and insensitive post but I just don't know what to do anymore.

He expressed to me a few days ago that he feels stale in his life and before I knew it the fears of schizophrenia, OCD and depression etc became real to him again. He also said he was scared he had gotten seratonin syndrome from the medication. 
He has only ever had two instances in his life where has had a mental low and experienced mental health symptoms. The first was situational (when he was 'diagnosed' with GAD) and the second was driven by the fear of reverting back to the first. Years apart.

I am unable to support him appropriately. Nothing I say will comfort him. He has not sought help outside of GP visits and medication. I am afraid he will continue to be prescribed meds instead of getting to the root of the problem. 

I don't know what to do. Please help me help him"
1264,Depression and insecurities,It has been harder for me to get out of bed or to find the energy to do something. I’m always feeling like a burden and a bother to everyone around me. Lost some friends as well because they were not empathetic towards mental health and that makes me wish I was normal.
1265,Made a shitty poem about choosing between life and death,"**The Crossroads of life:**

Stuck at to crossroads.

One is light, one is a faint glow of warmth.

Do I leave for peace of mind, or do I stay and hope for something?

I can decide my fate. 

Life is hard. Death is quiet and peaceful. 

I look at both of the ways I could go.

“Don’t go down that path.”

“It’s your fault”

If I choose the faint glow of warmth, I’ll be at peace.

If I choose the light, I’ll still be in pain.

“Don’t!”

“It is not your fault Natalie.”

“None of it was.”

“He did this to us. He denied what he did to me.”

“He claimed to have lost his temper.”

“He wrongly blamed you. We will not force you to choose what we want.”

“This is your decision alone.”

I scream and cry for my dogs to come back.

“If I die, maybe I’ll see them again..”

Friends. People who care for me. They don’t want me to die. Brook. She’s losing her friends.

*I won’t leave you.* 

I turn to the paths. Light, and warmth. Life is warmth as well as death. *Not yet. Maybe life is worth it if I work hard.*

I turn and run towards the light."
1266,I.......got raped? [NSFW],"I just tried to fall asleep as a memory just came shooting back into my head.
In 2015 i was 8. I had a bunch of 10 year old male friends (i'm female) who just had sex ed for the first time. As you'd expect, they were curious. As you'd also expect, 8 year old me was naive as fuck. So there was this dark corner of the school yard ( i think that's how it's called?) And they asked to touch my vagina. I said no because well, that is a quite logical thing to do. So they kept pressuring me until i said ok. I don't know if that's convidered rape or not and i feel quite guilty for it because i should have just kept saying no. Could it me that my extreme feeling of unease in situations with just one person or more intamate conversations are (not completly because of abuse) caused by this?"
1267,Feeling so bad about myself,"I won’t go into detail,but is anyone else’s situation so bad or embarrassing that you know almost everyone you know is talking behind your back and saying stuff?,it sucks and I know it’s true or well that’s what my minds telling me."
1268,Stress is making me suicidal again,I feel like anytime I have to do anything that remotely involves work I become extremely stressed. Tomorrow I have multiple things that I’m scared of that I have to do. I was doing really good for a month but for the past few days I have felt miserable. I have a lot of sleeping pills on my desk and I am thinking of taking them. What do I do.
1269,Mother Struggles- comparing pain,"So my Mum means well and tries to be supportive of me however she’s not always the greatest at making me feel good about myself. Consistently, she will “downsize” my problems. 

I know everyone has had it rough during the pandemic, I’ve been clinically depressed for years now and I’ve found the pandemic particularly tough. At the beginning of lockdown in the UK I tied a noose with every intention of using and somehow found the strength not to. I was made redundant in July, moved city to be home due to redundancy, got a new job as a support worker and wasn’t taken on from my probation due to poor performance associated with my mental health problems. A lot of people I know have killed themselves. 

I’m getting on day to day at the moment, I’m unemployed but I’m managing. 

I’ll talk to my Mum about how I’m feeling and she will compare, “things could be worse”. At Christmas she told me about how someone had shared a picture on social of people in the trenches at Christmas, “things could be worse”. The job I had was as a support worker for people with mental health issues and disabilities, her comment “see, it could be much worse- don’t you feel normal now?” 

I’ve seen other people post similar things and had other comments in the same way. Another one I’ve had is “it’s hard for everyone” I don’t want to squash my feelings, I know that’s not healthy. The pandemic is *hard* and I think I should be allowed to feel down. 

Back to my mum. I know, she means well but it completely invalidates my struggles. The first time I tried to commit suicide I was ‘told off’ for not telling her how bad I was getting but when I do this is the kind of response I get. It’s beginning to bug me and worse, it’s making me get down on myself. Advice/thoughts? I’m currently just brushing off what she says, she can be insanely critical and it’s hard to ignore."
1270,Writing about my trauma to try and cope,"Tw for abuse, nad a few other things I guess. 

Most of my memories are hazy. Ive found lately thats how it is with almost everything I try and remember. There will be the occasional clear memory mixed in with complete fuzz. Usually those are the memories I have recalled over an over again. I'm going to try and remember as much as I can. This Will likely be put or order but I'm going to try and avoid that.

I have a distinct memory of my mother telling me no one will like me if I have sideburns. At the time I had very thick sideburns due to a medical condition I have. I used to love them and the way they looked when I would look in the mirror. I still remember when I finally broke down and she took me to have them waxed off. My self image degraded pretty heavily after that. She would tell me that even if people told me they liked them they were just lying to me and secretly didn't. 

I have a memory of developing ocd as a child and washing my hands until they would crack and bleed. I think my parents ignored this. I know that they would get angry with me for washing my hands over and over again right before leaving the house. I remember one day drawing over my entire hands with Sharpe to try and prove just how deep the cracks went. 

I have memories of going to my mother for help and every one of those times developing into a fight where we both hurt each other. That developed into them not wanting to be there for me when I was upset. If I remember correctly I often felt like my mom was putting the blame of the situation on my shoulders under every circumstance when I just needed someone to be on my side.

I have a memory of long panic attack I had and begging my parents for help and them refusing saying they dont have time for me, and that I'll just get into a fight again. I sat for two hours in my room panicking in silence. I had decided that day to break up with someone and felt so worried about hurting their feelings it took hours to get over.

I have a memory of getting hit so hard in the face with a ball I couldnt chew for weeks. I hid this from everyone and I still have serious jaw issues. It hurts right now.

I remember wearing huge radio earmuffs with an antenna to ride to school on the bus. Kids would slap at the antenna until one day it broke. Those earmuffs were a huge lifeline for me as I later realized I have a sensory processing,disorder.

I remember kids would occasionally slap the back or side ,of my head at pep rallies.

I believe someone one came very close to sexually assaulting me in a dark hallway at bible study but I was too naive to realize it until much later. 

I have memories of feeling,like my dad thought of me sexually even though I know,if he did he didnt like his thoughts.

I have memories of coming out to my mom and her for months verbally abusing me, telling me I wouldnt even be able to get a job at mcdonals if I was trans.

I have memories of my grandparents intentionally misgendering me

I have memories of always slowly drifting away from friends.

I have memories of feeling so scared I would kill myself that I would throw blades away from myself as far as I could, minutes later pretending like nothing was wrong.

I have memories of having so many anxiety attacks that I began trying,to punch and slap myself until it would go away,

I have memories of teachers treating me badly because I struggled to hear them in classrooms, asking them time and time again to repeat themselves.

I have memories of getting sick but since my tempreture was so low regularly my fevers never registered as fevers (I used to be 96 degrees F normally so when,I'd go to the nurse with a 99 temp they always thought it was normal)

I have memories of developing pure ocd. Even though I was a kid I began to fear I was attracted to children. I was too scared it was true at the time I never saught help.

I have memories of begging my parents for forgiveness over very small things like dropping a small scrap of paper. They werent mad and didnt care but I obsessed over it for hours. (This was expecially bad when I was very young)

I remember not sleeping for 3 straight days because I felt too distressed about whether or not,I was trans.  I remember my parents not long after getting me tested for bipolar saying it was possibly a mental illness causing all of it.

I remember the doctor who said I was bipolar giving me advice on how I should go about my sex life telling,me not to be promiscuous. 

I remember getting a sex toy and my mom calling me a sex freak.

I remember thinking I had found a video of someone getting raped and going to my parents and getting blamed for watching porn, them basically saying it was my fault.

I remember getting caught jerking,off and my parents both saying I was supporting abuse and human trafficking. 

I remember my first night of college feeling so lost that I was physically sick having a panic attack for most of the night.

I remember an intense depression making it almost impossible to do anything. It took me almost 6 months to check my emails regularly. 

I remember putting huge amounts of effort into keeping a plant that meant a lot to me alive and then mourning said plant for months because it was one of the most important things in my life and it felt like my ability to be successful had just died. 

I remember starting to hallucinate spirits who were there to guard me. One at one point getting killed gorily causing me to become guarded heavily over the others.

I remember ""falling in love"" with a Man in his 30's. Wishing we could be together while he led me on.

I remember getting into an abusive relationship. Where I basically became their caretaker. They wouldn't listen when I said to stop touching me in places that made me uncomfortable. They gaslit me semi regularly and not long after they broke up with me I found put that they had falsely accused me of sexual assault and had spread rumors I was a pedophile.

I remember developing severe pedophilia ocd (pocd) sending me spiraling. I remember staring at the back of one of my ex-friends who believed them wanting them to feel an ounce of my pain. 

I remember crying and screaming into my phone for hours just trying to,convince myself they were wrong about me when my ocd wouldnt let me. all while my mom would blame me over the phone for having a nsfw account online. 

I remember getting hit by a car on my first day at one of my first jobs. It left a body sized dent in the side of the car and I had no injuries. I was completely calm until a few hours later when what happened really set in. I almost got blamed for stealing tips because someone finished the delivery for me and didnt report them.

I remember feeling so set on not going back to my family home I spent thousands of dollars to stay in various air bnbs. 

I remember wanting to start multiple things and having my parents tell me I would not be able to do those things. 

I remember spending 6 hours a day working to be a boxer for about 6 months all while going to school full time. 

I remember my landlord coming into my apartment with no warning with an old man to tour it at his side on one,of the first nights I was there and I remember thinking I was going to have to fight off a home invader.

For now thats all. This was incredibly refreshing thanks."
1271,I need help,"This is a desperation post. I’m not suicidal, but I have crippling anger and anxiety. I can’t work. I can’t relax. I can’t live. I’m severely depressed. I can’t stop pacing, I feel worthless. I had to take two weeks off work to focus on my mental health starting today. 

My anxiety is so bad that I can’t think clear. I can’t sit down I can’t enjoy anything. It is crippling. 

My anger is extreme. My wife has worked with adults with special needs and has never seen anything like it. I don’t ever get physical, I never want to. But I do want to break everything in my path. And it makes me want to break my own bones. I slam doors, I throw things, I knock things over. 

I need help in these next two weeks and I don’t want to go to inpatient care. What can I do."

1273,is there an anecdote for antisocial personality disorders (ASPD)/sociopath in relationships?,"a few psychiatrists suspected that I have ASPD borderline personality disorders or bipolar etc., only one of them made the diagnosis of ASPD combined with anxiety. I don't like the entitlements of sociopath or psychopath because people associate then with murderers villains and felonies. That is not true at all. I do not have a criminal record. Though I don't understand why rules are so important, I'd still obey them because I'm aware that it simply doesn't worth screwing my life for some thrills. 

Then for some reasons, probably loneliness and boredom, I never had trouble starting relationships. I like meeting new people, the excitement of new conversations hangouts etc. When I enter a relationship I tend to shape a very different personality without even consciously realizing doing so. I can be friendly, gentle, wild, open-minded, conservative, seemingly intelligent, thoughtful, educated, or simple, just a good listener, whatever that matches my partner's needs. However, I'm not sure if I actually have the ability to love someone, because after a while (6 months max), I tend to be very antagonistic, paranoid, exploitative and emotionally abusive. Almost every past partner has pointed out that I'm emotionally abusive, by gaslighting, passive-aggressive language or hysterical arguments etc. I'm not sure why I did those because those were definitely not my intention, it seems like the more I like someone the more I hate them too. If I can't help myself being hostile, does it mean I'm deemed to be lonely for life? or is there any solution for it? How do I avoid hurting my partner without feeling depressed myself?"
1274,In middle school I almost attempted suicide out of impulse.,"This is my first reddit post, so sorry if I make some mistakes, i’m also using a throw away account, since my brother knows I have Reddit and I can’t have him knowing this.
I am in high school right now so it’s been some years since i almost attempted suicide, but the thing is, I don’t have a clear idea on why I did it.
I remember what I was thinking and I will write it in this post, but the reason i’m writing this post is because I want to know if the reason I almost attempted suicide is connected to any mental illness, since simply searching online didn’t find me any answers.
I am aware that a person’s on the internet  apotheosis might not be correct, and i’m obviously not gonna self diagnose with any possible answer I may get, but i’ve been struggling alone for so long, I really can’t get a therapist and I really need somebody else’s opinion on this.
I am now going to explain the situation and what was happening and what was I thinking before my almost suicide attempt.
I can’t explain this in detail, because it’s a really personal family problem, but around the start of middle school there was an economy problem because of me 
In my family. My mother was away for work and my dad isn’t allowed at home so I was with my grandma, and she was trying to talk to me about the situation.
I didn’t want to tell her anything so I was trying to find a place to hide, the thing is I come from a really sheltered family so i’m never allowed to go outside, and I don’t have any keys for my room.
As I was frantically trying to find somewhere to hide I felt that in any way my grandma would have: been able to get in or been able to catch up to me.
I was thinking of running to my room and closing the door, but we were in my mothers room, which is right beside my bedroom, as I said I don’t have my bedroom keys so simply closing my door wouldn’t have helped, I also didn’t have anything to barricade it with. I remember my vision starting to get hazier(or glassy like? Like I was looking through a glass), and ‘shaking’ like when you’re about to faint. So that made me act faster thinking about other options, and the next one was thinking if I could open the house door for the outside, but grabbing the keys and opening the double door would have been too long, and I suddenly started feeling like even if I got out of the house or hided myself I felt like it wasn’t enough like in a weird way, I had to ‘escape’ even more. As I was thinking my vision starting getting more hazy so out of this impulse to ‘escape’ I went to the opposite room of the house from my mom’s bedroom which was the kitchen. Where out of, again, this impulse to ‘escape’ without stopping to think I took the the handle of one of the knifes in the kitchen and before I did anything I realised grandma entered the kitchen and I took my hand off the handle of the knife and, in a way ‘came back to my sense’ and I actually started speaking to her. I’m 100% sure I didn’t want to hurt anyone other than me with that knife as when I took the handle of the knife, at that point I had it clear in my mind that I wanted to stab myself. I have had nightmares from that since that day, of me committing suicide.
To this day I still don’t know exactly what made me act that way, so please if anyone has any idea, please respond.
And also if you have any questions I will do my best to answer them (obviously without giving away any personal information) Sorry if this was quite long, this is my first Reddit post. Thank you again for taking the time to at least read this."
1275,"I am obsessed with my mom, is this right?","Hi, I am a female, 23 years old, almost 24. Sorry if my English is awful, it's not my first language. 
My mom and I have always been pretty close to each other since I was a baby. My father left her without anything and we had to live by our own, she had to do everything by herself and she did it really good, she gace me the best education and values ever. Thanks to her I am a smart woman who has a great mind and I can get over every single hard situation. I've always loved her so much and so does she, we always talk about everything, and when I say everything I mean absolutely everything: sex, relationships, likes, dislikes, the past, the future... She is my best friend and I adore her. I see her as my God, my religion, I wanna take care of her and I want her to take care of me. I live with her and I ended a relationship of 2 years because I only wanted to be with her. I don't see myself with anybody else but her, she is my whole life and I feel like I don't need anybody, I was never unlucky with love, I had a couple loving boyfriends who were willing to take care of me, I just didn't want them because I cAn't be appart from my mom for so long. I've always had the thought that when she dies I'll kill myself. She knows her, I comment it with her and she gets sad but somehow understands me and ""supports"" me. You know when you find the love of your life and you'd do anything for that person? Well, I already found it and I have no doubts that that person is my mom. I wanna do everything for her and she is the only reason I am alive and I want all my dreams to become true. Her dreams are my dreams, and she always tells me that she would only be happy if I become what I always wanted to become. Just a couple weeks ago she also broke up with her boyfriend which she had for 7 years because he demanded he wanted to spend more time with her because she's 24/7 with me. And of course she picked me. She is my soul, my sun, my diamond my precious loving mother who raised me with the best intention ever, the mother who did everything she could for give me the best life and show me that life is awesome and beautiful, the mother I want for the rest of my life. I don't want any of us having another relationship but ours, so does she. We can both go out to parties for sex whenever we want, we don't really need anybody because we have each other. If I ever want a kid she says she will help me raising it and we all would be a happy family, even though I don't really want kids in a long time. I personally don't think this is toxic since she supports me with everything and my life is successful. I am not imature, the opposite, I've been told several times that I am good and handeling my own problems in life. I just want to know if there is someone like me, I would want to know by a proffesional if these ways of acting are fine or not, it's not that I am concerned but of course I would be a little if I've grown up being told that I am so close to my mother and that should not be possible. Thanks so much for hearing my story."
1276,Why do I feel so normal but not?,So I’m currently a teenager and for months on end I have severe mood changes like one wrong thing and I hate everyone and myself and I want to like die. For days I haven’t been feeling ok maybe it’s because of my depression (which is diagnosed) but I just phase in and out of existence and black out for no reason. I feel like everyday is a loop and that I might have to rewrite this tomorrow in case the day is looping. I’m starting to see and hear shit constantly and I feel like I’m dying all the time.
1277,"Osdd 3, tw for mentions of trauma and childhood?","Hi. So I recently got a possible diagnosis of osdd 3 from my therapist and I’ve been trying to find info on it but I can’t find much beyond the dsm v definition. Does anyone have anything? 

I’ve had depersonalization symptoms since sixth grade (I’m 18 now) and started dissociating a few months ago but beyond that I don’t really understand it. Everything I know abt dissociation (which isn’t much to be fair) focuses on trauma but I don’t know if I’ve been traumatized by my childhood. Like my parents did what they thought was best and they did have their good moments but also like some things just don’t sit right? And like, I know other ppl who have been through worse and like I know that doesn’t mean my experiences aren’t valid but I’m still struggling w just trying to categorize my childhood. And so everything is kinda triggering imposter syndrome. And so like it’s nice to have something that explains they symptoms that aren’t related to my depression and anxiety, it’s also scary bcs it’s like hey. Another thing I have to learn to accept, and it’s just another thing my bf didn’t sign up to deal with. So I guess basically I need more info on osdd 3 and answers on if I’ve been traumatized by my childhood?"
1278,I can't get over it...,"I have a boyfriend and I love him so very much, I'm gonna spend 11 days at his place and I would really love to be able to have sex with him, but I can't get over the fact that I'm not ""pure"" anymore.
I wasn't ready, I said no, and I even cried, it hurt and it scared me... It was more than a year ago but I keep having nightmares about it, I feel like it's somehow my fault, I shouldn't have froze, I should have cried louder, and now I don't have it anymore...
I hate it... It hurts so much knowing that I can't give it to someone special...
It hurts so much knowing that I'll be afraid, and maybe I'll even panic and cry.
I just want to feel good... I want to forget..."
1279,Opening up over text,"I have social anxiety, and so it’s really difficult for me to open up to people, especially verbally. It’s a lot easier to do it over text. Recently, I’ve been wanting to tell my close friends about my social anxiety, as it’s something I’ve only recently come to terms with. Is it okay if I do this over text? I don’t need an in depth conversation or anything, I just simply need to tell them, but I’m not sure if that’s a bad idea or what it would be like from their perspective."
1280,Looking for advice and hopefully some help,"I wont go into detail as it's a very long story but to sum up, my ex turned half of my closest friends against me and they all spent months making my life a living nightmare and constantly tried to make me kill myself, I have my reasons for why I didn't just cut them out of my life. I don't know why they did that to me but it happened, luckily I'm a strong person and can withstand the traumatic events they put me through even if I've come out with PTSD, but I also came out with the worst possible testable case of depression and am fully reliant on the meds to basically even stay alive. I'm subject to nearly constant flashbacks and memories of the things they did to me, and to make matters better or worse, because of the kind of person I am and how I was raised I'm dead set on revenge, luckily I'm smart and wont do anything illegal but no matter how much therapy, no matter how much medicine I'm put on the pain wont go away and just keeps getting worse and worse. I basically just live off hatred now, I have no negative feelings towards myself, just a cold bitter life of hatred and pain. It's been like this for half a year now and for the other half they were doing the horrible things they did to me.  I don't know what to do anymore, it's getting so much worse daily now, I'm a indie game dev who's game is tackling these kind of mental health issues since I have them myself so I thought I could do what many others have and make a game with a strong message and a show of the sad reality of this stuff for those living with it, but ever since me and my friends started on it I've just been worse, be it I finally have some happy moments on occasion, but it's outweighed by pain. I can't even work on it now, I want to so badly but I can't I just can't get myself to do it and it's literally been my life's dream to make a indie game and this is the game I've dreamed of for almost 10 years, but I can't do it because I'm so miserable. My friends have been telling me I need to take action and sue my ex and the monsters I used to call friends, because they caused me that much harm, but I don't know it doesn't feel right, they were being selfish and made my life hell but they were doing it because they were miserable but they traded their misery for my happiness and now I have all of their misery and they have all my happiness as cringy as that may sound. The hatred and anger within me says I should sue them and get the justice I deserve after what they did to me, and I have all the evidence in the world to prove everything they did, so I would win; but at the same time I've always been a really forgiving person (some even say I'm far too forgiving) and I feel like I should let them go. I'm terrified of living with this for the rest of my life, nothing the therapists have done nor the medicines are helping anymore. I'm trying to be happy but I just keep feeling more and more pain. Does anyone have any advice? I don't know what to do anymore..."
1281,How to stop self harm?,"I've been diagnosed with moderate depression+mild worsening and have been on medications since 45 days or so, I've also changed therapists recently after 3 months and am still under therapy, but my self harm instincts are still there, it's become more of an addiction, does anyone have any advice on how to stop it or alternatives to self harm? 
I tried distraction techniques, but it doesn't work for a long time and these days I barely get reasons for self harm, I feel like just doing it for no reason. Any advice is welcome."
1282,Depressed but a little more confident,"I’m going through a very weird time rn. I’m not happy. I’ve had several breakdowns since last month. Therapy helps but only goes so far and is expensive as shit. I’m very lonely, bitter, sad, and just feeling like nothing matters at this point. I’ve lost 10 pounds which leaves me at 90. I have to leave the house and go to the park sometimes just to get my head on straight and relieve my sadness. I have very few good friends I can talk to and they’re busy most of the time. I’m still not over some garbage that happened in 2019 and carry the scars from that year. Yet despite all this theres moments where I feel, almost nothing. Like completely neutral, I don’t care about anything, I just get through the day and that’s it. It’s like a blur sometimes I find myself loosing track of the days often. I feel like I’m disassociating from everything rn for better or worse. But I also found a way to get some closure on some bad events that happened and I feel much more confident and liberated because of it. They say college is supposed to be one of the most interesting and important parts of your life yet I find myself simply not giving a shit. I’m doing great academically but I just don’t care anymore. I don’t feel like I’m living a life, I’m just subconsciously going through the motions. It kind of scares me sometimes. Idk what to do about it tho"
1283,i feel so stupid,"obligatory mobile &amp; throwaway spiel 

so i’m in high school, and i just checked my classes for the next semester. when i signed up, i specifically signed up for the *painting* elective because i wanted to do that but when i checked, i saw i had *drawing* which if you don’t know, are two completely different classes. and for some reason, i just broke down, because i was so upset. i’ve always been someone who gets upset over small things and it makes me feel stupid."
1284,Anyone else anxious about therapy possibly not working?,"Look, if you weren't and this post just made you anxious I'm sorry. Maybe these comments could help us both idk. Sorry again, mate.  


Basically, I was raised in an abusive situation. The result? Me becoming a freaking rock. I actually can't really describe what the result is, because it just screwed over... well, me. My entire perception of reality, how I see situations is incredibly different than how other individuals may view them. I have an incredibly skewed moral compass now, and as a result, I sometimes have morally incorrect view of situations, be it too aggressive or too forgiving, and might come off as controversial lol.  


  
I have been aware for about a year now that I probably- no, I do in fact ***need*** a ton of therapy. Then I remembered all the stigma about it that I've heard from others. So I began doing some research, and found a few videos clarifying it. That handled that. This was a few months ago, and I've never forgotten my research. However, recently I started having these random doubts of my own.  


Like, to give a few examples:  


* ""Is therapist work a paid job?""
* ""What if my therapist isn't talking to me to help, but instead just wants some pocket change?""
*  ""Will they really see the true me, or just 'patient #7: That random boy'?""
* ""What if therapy doesn't work?""
* ""Therapy isn't a fix it all, so what if it just does not heal all the pain like I'm imagining?""

&amp;#x200B;

Don't mind how odd and philosophical some of these questions are. I have a habit for that stuff. But, these questions have been haunting me all day. Maybe it's the preinstalled view that social workers just want to place me in the system, and since therapists kind of fall under the same umbrella they = the same individuals. I don't know, hoped to discuss that in therapy as well, but I can't if I have all these questions. Even worse is the more I ponder on this topic, the more questions develop.  


  
So, apologies to anyone this post may have harmed. I just know when I need to reach out for some assistance, and this is one of those times. I do not wish to inflict this anxiety onto anyone else, and I'd feel guilty if I did. I know this might just catch someone off guard though, so to you my friend, I'm so sorry.  


  
Does anyone here have any suggestions? Possible solutions to this? All answers are appreciated!"
1285,Loneliness,"Hi guys, I hope you are all staying safe and are doing your best to make it through these times. Im 17 and I’m dealing with the troubles of the pandemic. School stresses me out, and I can’t leave my house. As of late I’ve been alone. I had to split with one of my two childhood (We calling him Mack) best friends because our friendship became a toxic pity party for him for the last 4 years. And the other I just stopped talking too because him and my other friend (We will call him Calvin) were also extremely close. Now let me say that I didn’t try talking to Calvin at all, but it’s because I thought he would’ve been happier only managing one of us, Instead of dealing with us both. But what hurt me is Calvin didn’t reach out either, and in that span of about 1 month when I wasn’t talking to Calvin, he essentially replaced me with a mutual friend of ours, and began treating me like a child, and that I was the one who deserved pity. This is what began my spiral of becoming alone. My two closest friends are practically out of my life, I’ve only talked to one a few times (Mack), while the other I occasionally send a meme or something (Calvin). I tried at first branching out to other people, I joined my schools soccer team in the beginning of the year while the pandemic calmed down for a bit, but all the people treated me like an outsider, and it felt like no matter where I went I would always be rejected, and treated like an outcast. As of now I’ve started smoking weed a lot more then I used to, and at this point it doesn’t do anything. The music I listen to feels like a constant reminder of the hole im in. I’m stressed out, I’m just getting sadder, and I hate being alone now, I talk to no one and I don’t know what to do, I’ve tried everything, and now I’m just sad and confused"
1286,Hallucinations?,"When I started my mental illness journey I’d have auditory hallucinations with occasional visual. The visuals would either be out of peripheral view or direct. I could look and it would be there never scary. Don’t think they ever said anything just starred and creeped me out. 
It’s been a very long time. Recently I notice the peripheral hallucinations. When I look nothing is there but lots of peripheral. Maybe having auditory but it’s my own voice? It’s never been before so I just can’t tell if I’m just thinking crap to myself and don’t realize or what... does that make sense? I told my husband today about the visual because I’m scared of slipping. I’ve been unmedicated for 4 years I think, now have insurance with my work but scared to start meds due to side effects.   
Any thoughts. Opinions. Support. Anything would be help and appropriated. 
Thank you."
1287,How to deal with recent trauma?," Yesterday I got a call and found out my fiance was shot in the back and in the hospital. He was in surgery for about six hours yesterday and he's still in the ICU sedated and on a ventilator. I called the hospital today for an update and was told he lost a lot of blood and he'll be on the ventilator for a few more days. 
  I've never experienced this much stress and I don't know what to do. Because of covid rules I can't go into his room, only view through a glass window. Ever since I got the news my chest feels heavy and I can't think straight. I wish I could support or comfort him somehow. I've never been so anxious in my life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
1288,Ranting I suppose? Maybe...help?,"So I've been feeling kind of down for a long enough time now and I don't know what to do or who to talk to. Getting out of bed and putting any energy I have to use is getting harder and harder. 
I'm distancing myself from my mum and I cancel plans with friends because I can't make the effort to see them (before covid of course) 

Im still jobless, don't have much of a social life. Right now it seems like my life is going nowhere, even though I'm in college (and maybe somehow going to uni) I don't see a future for myself. 

The thought of suicide has crossed my mind more than once, but I hopefully would never go through with it. I'd have moments (especially in college) where I'd start tearing up for no reason whatsoever! 

Although I have people in my life who'd probably be more than happy to listen to me, I don't feel close enough to any of them to talk about my feelings, it's awkward bringing up stuff like that. I'm not even sure where I would start or what I'd tell them. 
To be honest I don't even know why I feel the way I do and I can't even remember when this started. 

I'm bad at putting things into words so this is all over the place. 

Does anyone know how to overcome this?
This issue is not as big as others I know, just needed to get this out there."
1289,Can’t handle being bad at something,"I used to enjoy playing video games and I was decent would play bad sometimes but I never got too mad. Recently I’ve had to stop playing games because I can’t handle it. When I play bad which is more and more often now I get so mad at myself and don’t know what to do. It’s kind of hard to put to words but I just get so mad, I’m not mad at any person it’s just anger that I can’t do anything about it I feel powerless and I hate it. I don’t want to quit because I know this is just like running away from my problems but sometimes I just can’t handle it I feel like if I keep playing I’ll get too mad. I’m not an angry person and generally am calm and collected I just can’t handle being bad. It’s not losing that makes me mad it’s me playing bad. I’ve also noticed that even when I do play well now I don’t really feel that good about it. I don’t know how I can change this because it feels like the way my brain is wired and something you can’t change because you want to. I wish I could play video games and have fun but I have to stop myself from playing now because I know I’ll get mad and just be in a terrible mood."
1290,had a very anxious day,"being out of work, my days are pretty unstructured and i don't often have to do anything or be anywhere at a specific time.  usually when i do, it's for a doctor's appointment and, have to say, i even get anxious about those.  basically, just meeting any obligation with a degree of uncertainty gets me stressed out even if it's really not a big deal.  i have a lot of trouble putting things into perspective and often feel as though these minor events are actual life and death situations.  i feel like if i'm five minutes late, i might as well be dead.  

because this sort of thing makes me so anxious, my entire day revolves around whatever obligation i've got.  if i had an actual life, i'm sure it would just be a casual thing.  most of the time these things are something a normal person would 'just swing by' to do.  i try scheduling everything early in the morning so it doesn't ruin my day but it's not always possible.

today i had two very small obligations that took me on a rollercoaster of anxiety.  swear to god, i was all over the place, from borderline mania to panic.  what this really brings home to me is how accustomed i am to having zero stimulus.  all the time i spend with absolutely nothing going on makes me really really sensitive to having something going on.  i'm most comfortable sitting alone in my room all day without any plans involving the outside world."
1291,im so sick of feeling empty,"any time im alone with my thoughts too long i start to overthink and overfeel and i feel a void in my chest. i just want to be happy for a little bit again and it feels like its never going to happen

i think i died and im already in hell"
1292,so my dad got made at me for letting the phone die,"\[Ignore spelling/grammatical errors since it’s 12:30. ALSO THIS IS LONG AS HELL FUC-\]  


Hello yall, Ima tell you something that just happened now. So, I have a phone, right, and I was using it. I let it die and then switch to another device. when I messed with the wifi on my device all of a sudden my sister’s device goes off (it was connected through wifi apparently to the phone). dad calls, I thought it was because of my device (since I see a blue connect thingy at the top, meaning someone is connected to my device), but when I told my dad the phone died he was like ”THAT’S WHY”. came down stairs and he yelled at me. I told him that I thought it was because of my ipad. he told me my sister’s devices won’t shut off immediately after the phone dies.

now we’re in the kitchen while he was yelling at me. I called him rude once and then he hit me. first in the arm, then second arm and continuously on my thighs. ever time he asked what I called him I said “rude” and then he would hit me. thighs became numb so I moved away. we continue to argue over him hitting me over a phone, but apparently it was because of my words of choice. I was like “am I not allowed to call you rude?” and he was like “YOU DONT TALK TO YOUR ELDERS LIKE THAT. I LET YOU GET AWAY WITH ALL THESE THINGS AND YET I NEVER DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT”. another defense was “I CAN YELL AT YOU WHENEVER I WANT TO” when I told him yelling was rude. AND THE MOST COMMON REASON “you’re just a child (well he called me a baby even tho Im a teen wtf).

at one point I was like, “there‘s no point in arguing with you since you won’t change your mind” and I said ”whatever” when I was saying something. He deemed that as disrespectful and I just started laughing. half psychotic laughing mixed with genuine-ish laughter. I think I was over it. I thought it was so stupid how he got mad at me for saying whatever and apparently it was because of the word phrasing. like, all I said was whatever and you’re gonna get mad over that? idc about the word phrasing, sure, I might have been giving some attitude but like he literally hit me continuously and besides, he was being rude. I was just done man. he also brought the school in saying I get shit from there and I was like “how can you bring the school in but I can’t because I’m a minor”. he asked me what a minor was, I said someone under 18. and he’s like ya.  

to leave things on a good-ish note I asked what time it is. I always do that just to make it less tense ya know? also, when I was laughing I thought of attacking him or getting a knife. uh, I probably need help if I think that.

man, literally fuck my family, and before someone says it, yes, my sister is probably the favorite child (probably because she’s on the spectrum but I hate how she gets special treatment from my dad while I hear him rant about americans being ignorant, politics, etc etc. like idc if you’re on the spectrum, I know you need a bit more help but not a bit more love tf.)

if I’m heading in the wrong direction, blame my dad for being an asshole. sometimes I wanna visit him when I get older but idk man, that might change and I’ll probably just leave and never see him again. god I wanna laugh like a physcopath again. felt great man. crying while writing this, that’s it. lol, need advice pls.

&amp;#x200B;

\[extra: someone told me I had bpd after looking over my comment history and gave me what I do during an episode and what I can do to make it stop. so ya. also I cry when someone raises their voice with is a bpd trigger so. not saying I have it since I gotta get medically diagnosed but which the situation Im in all I can do is seek help online.\]"
1293,This is destroying me," I'm hurt so much by my intrusive thoughts and the arousal accompanying them. It started with incest thoughts, now it's moved on to pedofilic thoughts. I never once was aroused by the thought of depraved acts with a young boy or girl before this but since my OCD came back a few months ago I've been getting aroused by these thoughts, even though theres nothing I like about a young persons body. I really hope It's just arousal from anxiety. I can still get turned on by normal things but when I think of the most depraved things imaginable, stuff I'd never do in a million years, I get turned on by them too. It's like the more I dislike the thoughts, the more i'm turned on. It's ruining my life. If anyone could talk to me and help me in any way I'd greatly appreciate it."
1294,Am I going crazy,I had this very vivid dream that the world ended and ever since that night I have believed that I actually died. Like I’m in the after life and I’m going a little crazy because I can’t tell what’s real and what’s not anymore
1295,Strong attachment to stuffed animal,"Me and my (now ex) boyfriend broke up in September. I have to admit, as the dumper, it hurt me really badly (it was a toxic relationship and he ended up ghosting me in the end and it was just overall not healthy due to other things) and my mental health plummeted. After my girls, family, and my cousin, talked some sense into me, I think I’ll be just fine in the end of it all. However, I notice I have a very strong attachment to a stuffed animal I’ve had since I was 3 (I’m 23 now). Every time when I go to bed, I have to have it by my side or else I freak out lol. 

Idk why I do this... is it because it makes me feel whole? I have no idea."
1296,Is it unhealthy to want to be heavily medicated during a breakup?,"**TW: Drug abuse (albeit accidental)**

So It's looking like I'm heading towards a breakup of my longest ever relationship. I have a ton of abandonment issues, am no-contact with my abusive single parent, and have been diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, and anxiety. It also appears that an OCD diagnosis is in the works. My boyfriend is emotionally abusive, and I have been feeling for some time that it's time to go. But I'm constantly drawn back in by promises, and the fact that he is in therapy. I really do believe we're in a place where he has legitimately been improving slowly, but I've already given him 4.5 years of my life - I don't think I can keep this up unless he changes overnight. 

The problem is that my last two breakups were catastrophic for me emotionally - in my last one, I took a nearly dangerous amount of my medication, but this was as a result of my psychiatrist at the time putting WAY too high of a dosage in my script (my next psych explained this to me). The one before that left me in a nearly catatonic state, rocking back and forth, tears, the closest to suicide I've ever been in my life. The second situation was my longest relationship at the time. Now this one is. I share a home, a dog, and a lot of other things with this person.

One of the things that I know will help with coping is my therapist - I've been with her for a year, and I'm emailing her tomorrow to tell her that for the next few weeks, all of my sessions need to be geared towards preparing me for being alone. I've also warned one or two of my friends of what to expect (I don't have many, but I do have some), because I recall that the only thing that got me through my worst breakup was having friends present and being medicated.

I feel like this breakup is going to be even worse than that one. To be frank, I want to be so medicated that I can still function at work and that's it. As I mentioned, I may have OCD, as I have intrusive thoughts that literally make me incapable of doing anything for 24 hours or more. I'm in the midst of a mental health crisis right now related to this relationship that I've been in for 48 hours with the same issue. I'm starting a new job soon, and while the breakup may happen in 2 or 3 months, I don't want to be in a place where I literally cannot function at work because of these obsessive thoughts. I want to just not feel anything. I want to not care. Every time I get even slightly emotional about this person, I allow the abuse to continue and I'm done with it. Is this an unhealthy mindset? I want this to be the case for a few months while I get through the most of this stuff and slowly get off of it as therapy helps me along."
1297,"Is there such a thing as ""sleep anxiety""?","Essentially, I can never get to sleep until I am completely exhausted at night because I have a mountain of anxiety and dark and scary thoughts fill me head. These mostly circulate around death, the death of loved ones, if I am wasting my life, why I don't have friends, just generally unsettling things that terrorize me. 

This only happens when I try to sleep and I haven't slept without a fan on and some sort of video on since I was young because I hate silence.

Is there a condition that causes this? Or does anyone else suffer from this?"
1298,I can't afford to see my GP about my mental health,"I booked the appointment in advanced knowing I'd get payed beforehand, but I'm on government funding (lost my job due to covid) and they randomly cut me off and now I can't afford it. I'm freaking out. there's a cancellation fee and I can't even afford that. even with a rebate from Medicare i can't afford it. everything's going wrong and idk what to do. its literally tomorrow and idk what to do so haha fuck."
1299,My mental health has not been kind to me lately 😔,"I started to have severe episodes of anxiety in 2016. I have never experienced such a feeling until mid 2016. All due to toxic/abusive 5 year relationship that I was going through at the time. It all started with an unexpected panic attack in the middle of the night that woke me up.  (This was the first panic attack I have ever had in my life). Now followed by feelings of anxiety, fear, couldn’t sleep properly due to the anxiety, severe knot feeling in my stomach. This feeling was so overwhelming that I couldn’t lay in bed calmly and had to walk around to try not to think about the anxiety. All of this lasted for about 6 months. In those 6 months this feeling would subside slowly making it milder and milder everyday to the point that one day I felt like myself again. I never took meds, drugs, alcohol or anything like that to numb the feeling. My mental state seemed to have naturally healed itself. 

I was feeling good and like myself for almost a year until November 10, 2017 another panic attack struck. This time this episode lasted much longer than 6 months. I would say this episode had to have been worse as well. I had chest pains that would make me depressed and feel like I was going to eventually die from heart related problems, went to cardiologist at least 3 times,  all came back normal but the results  still did not help with relieving my anxiety. There were days I have felt an overwhelming feeling of depression that would go away within an hour or so. For about a year I had severe symptoms from this anxiety, always feeling my heart beat strong and fast, chest discomfort which caused me to feel depressed, severe knots in my stomach to the point that I sometimes would walk around for 3 hours just to try to keep my mind occupied and would also talk to myself in hopes of this feeling going away, severe fatigue, was extremely exhausted, I would sleep for my 8 hours and still be so tired as if I did not sleep. Shortness of breathe. I have tried everything from meditation to yoga, I even train in BJJ which is said to work for many ppl who have mental health issues, tried herbal remedies, deep breathing, etc etc etc but for some reason nothing has helped me get rid of this feeling, it only seems to numb it but I can still feel it lingering in the background just more mild than before doing an exercise or whatever I tried for relief. So for about 2 years or so since my second panic attack I finally decided to take medication because I couldn’t deal with this anymore. I have been on medication for over a year now. 

I have been on Zoloft 100 mg 2x a day and busporine 10 mg 3x a day. I felt that it was somewhat helping me  to the point where I could finally drink caffeinated drinks again and felt somewhat like myself. Now I am 32 weeks pregnant and about 3 days ago I had my 3rd panic attack which seemed milder than the other 2 I’ve had in the past but it was still very uncomfortable and of course as usual anxiety has followed up the next day .... it’s like a pattern. If I have a panic attack I will start having the same type of anxiety as I have has in the past. This time it is much milder than it has been in the past. Not sure if it has to do with the medication but either way the medication doesn’t even fully make it go away. I’m starting to lose hope and feeling like I will never be back to my healthy mental state i once had. I have a lot if anger towards my ex because of what he did to me to have caused me to lose my mind. I feel more depressed, guilty, angry, anxious, uncomfortable. Is this even really anxiety? How is this pattern always happening the same way, panic attack followed by more severe anxiety than natural/normal anxiety we all feel from time to time. But for me I feel it even when I shouldn’t be feeling it. Even with my panic attacks, I get them even if I shouldn’t get them. I hate feeling my heart beat this makes me even more anxious. It’s much harder to breathe and this also makes me feel anxious. Idk what to do. I’m exhausted. I would really appreciate all advice and opinions of what could be done and if this really is anxiety? Thank you guys !"
1300,"Anyone knows how to deal with bad thoughts like ""I deserve to die/am worthless/stupid""?","Hello^^;

I really hope I am in the right subreddit. Anyways, I have depression since a long time already and also most likely PTSD (not diagnosed yet). I had quite a traumatic childhood which ranged from emotional and physical abuse at home and a lot of bullying in school.

All of the things my parents and my classmates told me when I was younger are stuck in my mind and it's such a pain. I cannot stop these thoughts, at least I don't know how...
Has anyone else ever experienced it? And can give me some advice on how to improve it..?

Thank you for your answers in advance."
1301,Factitious Disorder (or some other mental health disorder) and Lymes Disease or just Lymes Disease? I don’t know my mom anymore!,"Okay, I’m gonna try to sum everything up the best I can... Growing up my mom was in school for the longest. She switched her major multiple times and then eventually finished nursing school and became an RN. She pursued that career for maybe 3 months and realized it was for her. She’s always been extremely fit. Worked out everyday. Yoga everyday. Swimming, biking, running. Everything. She eventually started developing pain in her neck, back, etc. and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Later she went on to complete an IRONMAN triathlon which she describes as one of the hardest things she’s done and it brought her extreme pain. Shortly after this she saw a doctor who had diagnosed her with Lymes disease and they tried to treat with antibiotics. Apparently the Lymes had manifested in her body for such a long time that antibiotics did not help and it has been dormant in her body for so long but attacks her when she is most vulnerable. My mom thinks she was but by a tick when she was younger and has had it since then. She then went on to “healthcare” facility called Envita where she was given treatment after treatment and was charged tons and tons of money for treatments that are not FDA approved to get rid of the Lymes and since then I’ve just seen her go down hill. The treatments seem to be pretty aggressive and it seemed to make her worse. I remember her talking about a ketamine treatment once that caused her to hallucinate and stuff as well. Shortly after this treatment started my mom became bed bound. Always in bed, not herself, not working out anymore, nothing. It seemed almost as though the treatment made her 100000x worse than she was to begin with. Well, the treatment didn’t get rid of the Lymes. So she was given the advice to go to Mexico to stem cell treatment. That didn’t seem to help either. I know there were a couple other treatments that she went through as well but I’m not quite sure what they were or where they took place because I live in another state and it was hard to keep up with everything at times. As time went on my mom started to change as a person as well. I really noticed the changed when I was at work one day and received a call from my mom who said she was dying and was on her death bed going to start hospice soon and I needed to come see her before this took place. So I dropped everything and my kids and I hopped on a plane to go see her. When I got there I could tell she was different but she was not in her death bed. She did seem a bit ill and uncomfortable but she wasn’t actively dying like described. I went with her to some dr appts where it seemed she did have some medical issues but nothing made it seem like she was dying or about to start hospice. I didn’t want to make it seem like I was insensitive to her situation but I was also extremely confused as to why my mom asked me to drop everything and go see her with money I really didn’t even have when it wasn’t that serious of a situation. I tried to make the most of the next couple days and I headed home. Shortly after I got home my mom texted me talking about how upset she was that I was totally “disconnected” during my visit with her and that I don’t care about her or what’s happening to her. That wasn’t the case but I didn’t know how to feel or what to think. Time wen ton and it got worse. If I didn’t text my mom back right away she would lash out and make me feel like I was terrible because I was busy or working and because I was in her phone plan at the time, she would have my phone shut off because I didn’t get back to her right away. She was starting to become overwhelming and emotionally draining because I would get back to her when I could but I also had my children to support and a household to run. It got worse when I was at work one day and my grandma called me to tell me that my step dad texted her saying “Jennifer (my mom) passed away last night”. I was immediately distraught and felt guilty that I didn’t connect enough with her on my trip to see her and I didn’t know how to feel. My manager told me to leave work and as I was getting ready to go, I thought to myself..”that isn’t a text message type of situation, that’s a phone call.” I called my step dads phone, no answer. Called my moms phone, no answer. Something didn’t seem right to me, so I called the police station in AZ and had them go check and see what was going on. I got a call back from them about 45 mins later. They talked with my mom and physically saw her and confirmed that she was in fact alive, not deceased. I later found out that my mom texted my grandma of my step dads phone and “faked her death”. At this point I was starting to become annoyed with everything. I felt like my emotions were being toyed with..and for what reason? Even then I tried to stay in contact and keep our relationship healthy but it’s still the same thing. Every week she is dying and starting hospice. But in reality she isn’t, she’s just lying to me about it. First everything hurts, then it’s her bladder and she has a chronic UTI that won’t go away. Then it’s her gut and her intestines giving her problems and she can’t have a bowel movement. Now it’s her stomach and she can’t keep any food or drinks down and throws up constantly. There will be times when she will call me to talk and start having a seizure but then be right back to normal shortly after. If the conversation goes in a different direction other than about her and her illness she will quickly divert it back on track and if it seems she isn’t getting the attention or sympathy she wants, she will go to extremes like threatening to kill herself, or talk about how she can’t wait to die, etc. I don’t know what’s real and what isn’t anymore. She’s been to so many drs. Some have told her that she needs to get psychological help, but she swears up and down that she isn’t crazy and that the government is trying to kill her because they created lymes disease to kill people off. This has all been going on for over 3 years now and I don’t know how to feel or what to do about it anymore. I feel so numb when she says anything anymore. She sent my son a birthday card and wrote him about how “she is going to be dead soon and she wishes she could see him before then but to have a happy birthday.” He’s 6! I refused to read him what his grandma wrote. To me it seems extremely selfish to emotionally mess with people like this constantly. I’m trying to keep an open mind about this, but it’s becoming extremely hard to do so. I’m getting so upset and annoyed with it all and I do believe she is ill but I’m starting to feel like it all or partly may be psychological. I decided to write and try to get some advice or opinions on this today after she texted me that she is starting hospice tomorrow. This is like the 10th time I’ve heard this in a 6 month time span. I could go on for days with examples of her behavior. I just don’t understand it. She is my mom, and I do love her. But I don’t even know who she is anymore and I’m starting to feel like distancing myself would be best, but I don’t want to abandon her either. I tried to tell my step dad that she has clear psychological issues but he doesn’t seem to agree. I’m starting to think that he’s been dealing with this for so long that he’s in denial or he doesn’t want her to lash out on him if he recommends mental help? Has anyone ever had experience with anyone like this?"
1302,Lexapro vs. Buspar,"Hey folks,

Wondering if anyone has tried either of these two medications and what their experience has been like. I met with a mental health professional today and described everything that’s going on (mild panic attack, heart racing at times, inability to sleep, trying to figure out what I did wrong with a relationship and how to fix it constantly racing through my mind, etc.)

Anyone experience similar symptoms and what was your experience with either of these medications?

I’ll be honest and say that I’m scared to take any medications for a mental health concern but at the same time maybe it’s what I’ve needed for a while and just didn’t know until now. She said either medication would be good for my situation and the preference would be up to me...

Thoughts?

Thanks for the help, I appreciate it"
1303,"Girlfriend struggles with nightmares, possibly PTSD. What can I do to help best?","My girlfriend struggles with depression and anxiety, which we both recognize and have been doing a good job of working on the baby steps that she needs to take to move forward, and I am so proud of her.

However, she gets set back sometimes from dreams. She won’t tell me much about them, but I know sometimes they are flashbacks to a rape, but her father was also abusive (in every way but sexually) and I have the feeling that is involved sometimes too. She thrashes and “cries” in her sleep, and when she wakes up from these if we’re cuddling and it’s not quite time for bed she shuts completely down and curls up. I’ve asked what the best way to help her with this and it’s always a shrug, which I understand. I just want to know, would it be best for me to leave her alone in these instances? Cuddle her? Not say anything? Just tell her I love her? Also, of course I know you guys and I can’t diagnose her, but does this sound like PTSD? From what I understand, I know a lot more about her than her therapist right now and I’m hopeful he can help her open up to him a little more. Sort of a rant, sort of questions. Thanks."
1304,My mental health is the worst it's ever been and just keeps getting worse.,"There's a lot that's going bad right now so this post might jump from one topic to another real suddenly. Also this might end up being a bit long. 

(Don't know if I need to do trigger warnings but I guess TW for; suicidal thoughts, self harm, and if there's anything else that need a tw I can add that.)

Basically my whole life I've had hallucinations and delusions, but for the most part I kept it hidden so no one would think badly of me. Recently things have been getting worse however, and its gotten to the point where I was convinced for over a month my cousin was dead until he was at Christmas dinner, I also almost told my boyfriend my brother died when my brother was completely fine because of this. I also hear things that aren't real a lot, occasionally see things too but thats rare, usually I just hear people saying my name or saying hello over and over again. As of lately the whole voice hearing thing has turned into people yelling at me or being mad at me, but I have a hard time remembering what they say or why they're mad at me. I haven't been diagnosed with anything due to me hiding it from people, so I don't really know what's going on or why I'm like this.

I don't understand whats going on anymore and at this point dreams and reality are indistinguishable anyway so maybe it's too late to be saved. I just want to be able to sleep.

Recently I've been starving myself, not because I want to be skinny or anything, I just like it when I feel so starved it hurts and everything feels cold. I also just kinda hate eating anyways since I almost never actually know if what food people give me is actually edible or poison, also just eating is disgusting anyway. I know some people really like eating aloy but it just isn't something I'm too fond of, I'll eat the minimum required to survive when I need it but thats it.

Something I've constantly had in the back of my mind at all times is that I always feel like I was supposed to die before the age of 10, sometimes its a specific date I think I was supposed to die on (probably june 13th) but now I'm well past that age and I feel like I'm not supposed to be alive right now. Usually it's not that bad, just me feeling like things are off but now I've actually kinda became suicidal over it? I was terrified of death before so I didn't want to die, just felt like the world wanted me dead. Now death doesn't really scare me, it's just the end of life, and if I was supposed to die and I'm not meant to be here then I should leave. I know it's not good to be suicidal but it just feels like I was fated to die a long time ago but now I've gone well past my due date and even if I only live one more day I still lived years longer than I was supposed to. I apologise if this doesn't make sense.

I don't feel like I'm myself anymore, this body isn't mine, this life isn't mine, these dull things like emotions aren't mine, ect. Everything feels like this isn't mine.

Sometimes I think I'm part rabbit, It FEELS like I have rabbit ears but I know they aren't there even though I can feel them. One of the rabbit ears is ripped in half. I know thats stupid though and this body is human but it feels so real to the point it almost hurts.

An odd thing that's been going on for years but thought I'd mention, I think I've become addicted to emotionally suffering? If that's even a thing thats possible in the first place. Basically the thought of being abandoned, betrayed, and cheated makes me feel very comfortable. It makes my entire body feel cold but cold in a way that feels right. I'm supposed to be the one that gets the short end of the stick and it feels comfortable knowing that everyone hates me like they should.


I also think I have trust issues, just no matter who it is I always think people who try to get close to me know about my past and are trying to betray me or get revenge on me for what I've done. Even my boyfriend I still sometimes think he's secretly a friend of a *certain person who shall not be named* but I try to ignore that. It's weird seeing people say that they think someone wouldn't kill them because they trust them, I just don't get it, people kill eachother even if they actually do love eachother all the time. Why don't people understand that anyone could betray them at any point? Sometimes it makes me feel disgusting when people talk like everyone can just be friends and be happy, as if I'm some cartoon villain. When I was younger there was a time where I thought my dad was going to kill my cats, my mom acted like it was a huge deal for me to have thought that, even though I think that way about everyone and everything.

I've been keeping all of this hidden because It wasn't that bad and it was manageable, now that it's getting worse a lot faster than I thought it would I think soon people will start noticing, if they haven't already. I will  do anything so that people don't find out but soon they'll find out and I'll probably be made to go talk to doctors and my life will be ruined beyond repair.

I've started biting myself again, It's just sort of a habbit now I guess, it hurts but I don't bite hard enough to leave marks so for me its far better than cutting or anything that would leave marks that let people find out about it. Also it just makes me feel better when I'm really hungry but food is too disgusting to eat.

My biggest fear right now is that I'll have to take some sort of pill or medication, those things make me feel disgusting. I don't want anyone to find out I'm wrong and try to fix me. I just need to be able to keep this hidden but I can't do it, every conversation I have to tripple check what I say so that I don't accidentally say something wrong but it's getting harder not to mess up. I know I'm going to mess up and fail so it's more so a matter of ""when not if"".

I hate this. I really do. I just don't want to have to go to doctors and take medications or be put into a mental hospital. Goddamit I feel disgusted by how much I'm failing to keep things under control. All of this I could probably keep control of if I actually tried but I can't get myself to do anything. I don't know why I'm like this, I have a completely normal family and I wasn't traumatized as a kid so I don't know what's wrong with me or why I'm acting this stupid.

This is mostly a vent but if any of you have advice then feel free to tell me, might not trust you entirely but I'll still keep any advice in mind. Bye."
1305,Is my problem related to mental health or another teen age prob?.,"I am a 19 yrs old boy .I am a 1st yr med student from India. i just got into college a few days. They have started online classes. I haven't met any friend since 10- 11 mnts . Now a days i sleep for over 10 hrs daily (I usually used to sleep 6hs normally) I get up with a feeling of sad and pain . Its not because of any specific thing or reason . And all day this feeling continues . I dont have any friends to chill with . I am now at home with my parents and they dont seem to care how i feel. I read some online articles and they said to do what makes me happy . Technically speaking i dont feel happiness in doping anything. But the things that requires a lot of attention sometimes diverts me from the feeling of sadness. some of those things are studying , playing chess etc . I feel terrible every day and every time .Is there any way that can stop feeling terrible . I dont think this is normal and i cant live long with this feeling.

I am not suicidal.  But i sometimes think isn't our life worthless. All life we need to chase a shadow named success and when we are successful our body is old and gives up and then we die and then we produce offsprings to do the same. Is it not more intelligent to just die in the very start? Why struggle all your life to die?. When u can just die without the struggle .

1306,Shutting down,"Why do I tell myself it’s okay to reject my emotions, good and bad, instead of facing my problems? The past few days I’ve let myself slide into a state of 0, a neutral place of my mind and emotions that I am not fond of. It takes me away from my loving wife, I don’t enjoy time with people I love and usually look forward to seeing. 

I am looking for a way out. 

Does anyone else who experiences this have any advice or a tip or anything to help me to feel my emotions again. 

I want to show myself and my wife that I am here and have the emotional capability and capacity to be happy and sad and excited and aggravated and everything in between. 

Any help is appreciated."
1307,Just way too much to write.....,"I’ve been trying to post about my current issue for months now. I created this account on NYE, with the purpose of communicating my issue and maybe possibly just getting some help. 

I’ve read so many posts and replies in this area hoping to find someone with a similar issue to mine, so I have some idea how to formulate into writing. The same goes for replies to posts and comments— either a great example of how to write and post or a comment that addresses enough of my issues where I can just proceed from there. 

Tonight alone for over 4 hours I’ve been trying to write about my current situation. I’ve read, written, RE-read, edited, deleted and started over again. My head, neck, upper back, shoulders and arms are in pain. They ache, cramp, spasm etc. and my eyes hurt. 

So finally I came to this conclusion:

I’m just gonna have to find someone to speak to verbally. If you know of this service please provide any contact info. Website, phone number anything else. 

I prefer to speak on the phone however I’ll settle for zoom if that’s the only option, but I really dislike video conferencing. 

Before I write thanks, I’d like you to know that just by reading this you are providing me more help then you can phantom. Please believe me when I say My gratitude is endless. It is sincerely appreciated. So with that said.....

Thanks."
1308,Almost to my breaking point,"Hi everyone, I don’t like opening up to my peers for some reason but I thought if I need to get help seeing other views on it would maybe give me some perspective if I’m not too far gone. 

Im a marine and lately haven’t been feeling myself at work or even on my own time. The job is stressful but I never want to use that as an excuse for how I’ve been feeling. I’ve been on a downward spiral since about July early august. A woman I loved very deeply left, but not completely. It’s just the circumstances that pushed us apart and made us realize how much it wouldn’t work. On top of that my mother moved to Washington with a guy I don’t like at all. The guy is a leech and now I can’t be there to help her out. The stress of the job on top of all of this was the icing on the cake. 

Since about September I’ve been drinking heavily and smoking a lot more than I ever have before. It’s the only thing that really makes me feel something anymore, my sleeping habits have been utter garbage and eating has become a chore I force myself to do. Lately it’s gotten extremely bad. Suicide has been in my mind a lot and I always tell myself never to get to that point. However after coming back from holiday leave the entire trip felt wrong. Like there  was nothing left for me. The place I’m suppose to feel myself and not be a marine for a little didn’t give me any joy, all I did was the same thing I do at work. Drink, smoke, and think. I’m since convinced I have nothing left. I feel like a husk of the man I was and wanted to be. No emotion, no motive, no anything. I don’t want to get to the point I always told myself I wouldn’t get to but it’s like my brain is forcing me to think In ways I never thought I would. I have nothing left to fight for in my view. I don’t know what else to do."

1310,To be honest this is half wanting opinions half venting,"Recently I started using Reddit for advice type stuff so I figured I might as well talk about a reoccurring problem with my mental health.

I might have trauma or ptsd truthfully I don’t know and I’m not self diagnosing but it’s just the best way to describe it. I didn’t have the best childhood waking up my mom didnt really care about me really only viewed me as a child support paycheck. I also had an abusive stepdad who would genuinely try and kill me at times when mad. He actually wasn’t that bad of a dude when he took his medicine but he never really did because I guess because he didn’t realize anything was wrong with him mentally. I mean I’m describing it very nonchalantly because I don’t know how to truly talk about it in a way that does it justice.

My stepdad has been dead for about 2 years now he basically accidentally killed himself. Something he always use to do when my mom tried leaving was he would hurt himself as a threat that he would kill himself if my mom left and well they didn’t find him in time this time.

And well after he died I went to my real dads house and just lied in bed for a about a week straight I didn’t even eat I just drank water I can’t even remember how long it was but I think it was about a week 5 days at bare minimum.

For a long time it felt like everything I grew up with haunted my every moment all I could think about was what happened for a while I became extremely suicidal the only reason I’m even alive is because I’m a coward simply put.

It’s gotten a little better over time I mean honestly I thought I truthfully completely recovered. one night I just kinda cried it all out maybe like 4-5 months ago.

But it’s been coming back up in my mind recurring especially this one incident that I remember vaguely but vividly at the same time I think it was the first time my stepdad tried to kill me and it was when I couldn’t get out of his truck because there were no door handles on the inside so you had to grab onto something in the door and pull on it open it.

I couldn’t see what to pull because it was dark so I yelled out asking him to come and open it from the outside which still has a door handle 

And he came down and he started choking me out he really wasn’t going to let go I don’t think I think the only reason he did because I was kicking him repeatedly and he actually realized what he was doing but over the years he would try killing me multiple times over it got down to a routine i always moved my big wooden toy box in-front of my door and anything else I could move and grabbed my knife I kept hidden in my room

Just imagine that but basically on repeat my entire childhood then all the sudden he kills himself. I went to my real dads for the summer after that since it was the end of the school year anyways. Time kinda just became a blur for around a week after that i drank water but I didn’t eat anything I think the first thing I ate was some freshly made popcorn from our little popcorn machine. It wasn’t really dramatic or anything I wasn’t like crying the entire time it was just a certain emptiness maybe not emptiness but more of relief and what felt like the first time I truly felt peace for a while.

Once the initial effect was over the after effects came and I really started getting hit by what actually happened I felt really just worthless is a way to describe it I realized after all that time my mom doesn’t love me the only thing holding her down was my stepdad and I’m nothing but a nuisance to my real dad I’m just a burden to him really. I’m describing it bad but im talking about something essentially two years ago and i don’t have a good memory and truthfully I’m just now getting better. I don’t really actually understand why I was sad I might be wrong truthfully it may have just been because the abuse.

I’m really starting to come with terms that something isn’t exactly right with me mentally most likely because of these things I experienced or atleast I’m hoping that’s what caused it and I’m not just naturally the way I am but a way to describe it is I’m pretty sure im either depressed or have some sort of trauma and I want to go to therapy but I’m not 18 yet so I cant because that requires me to go through my dad and I don’t want him knowing about it I barely have told him anything about what I actually went through while my stepdad was around but I definitely don’t need him thinking I’m mentally ill. My dad is good and but he’s not exactly the best with stuff like that and well it’s impossible to get help unless I go through my dad so I really can’t get any help till I turn 18"
1311,Half age regression?,"I'm rather frequently experiencing something that I think could be half regression. 
Sometimes I become really hyper, like I was when I was about 8-10 on my good days. I become very loud, feel very giggly but also start crying very easily. It usually feels very intense and that state isn't easy to get out of.
Other times, when I'm feeling very low, I curl up in my bed just as I did as a child. My body starts feeling weirdly small? It's a bit like flashbacks to a feeling. When that happens, at the same time adult me is also present. It feels a bit like two different people in one body and one tries to calm the other, which usually works. It's like I'm parenting myself.
When I sort through old stuff I also become childlike again. Also I get strangely attached to my old stuffies and cry if I have to get rid of them.
And then, most recently, I had a bit of a mental breakdown and became extremely attached to my dad. I felt like a small scared child and that was really weird. Also I kept thinking of how my parents will die someday and that's something that haunted me when I was younger. When I'm in a normal headspace, I'm aware of that reality and have less or more accepted it eventhough I don't like it. I'd know how to live independently even if it wouldn't be that easy, but In that weird state I feel completely panicked about it.

I just don't know where all this is coming from. I don't   think I have experienced trauma and I definitely don't have did. My family wasn't the most peaceful growing up, there was a lot of yelling, but my parents were still always there for us and protected us. As an edgy teen I hated them sometimes because they are also kinda controlling but things have changed a lot and I can sincerely say I love my parents. 
This entire thing is really weird."
1312,Does weed bring out disassociation,I don’t really smoke weed often at all. Whenever I have I always look down and am confused that I have hands. I also start talking in accents for some reason.

1314,My tire went flat and I had a breakdown,"Today was especially tough for me. I was planning on going to get some clothing which I haven't done in over a year. I finally got ready and actually brushed my hair and my tire went flat. I tried to use the air compressor but the hole is on the side of the tire and was leaking too fast. 

This has completely broke me it feels like no matter how hard I try I cant get things done. I know that sounds so silly and I shouldnt let these things get to me but I do.

This was also a bad day with family as my sister was especially cruel and ended up with me and my luggage on the side of the road with no working vehicle. I'm pretty lost right now and having a bad day in general. My thoughts seem very scrambled and I feel a deep depression coming on.

1315,How do I forgive someone and let go if there is no reason for me to hate them?,"Hello, for half of my life I’ve known a certain person who I just dispise. It’s not just them but in a lesser extent also others who reminde me of them. I have always felt strongly about this person since I met them in my child hood. I have always blamed all that is wrong with me on them but have come to terms that they are not the problem and I just felt envy towarda them. I have hated this person for so many years that even if I don’t blame them for any of my problems in a logical standpoint I can’t still fully forgive them. I have no real reason to hare them but I do. Deapite them not being in my life nor have I any methods to contact them directly I think about them every day. I regularry dream about them and thinking about something other seemes almost impossible because I see no way for me to feel true happiness if they are not suffering or worse of than me. But since I can’t comprihand them as a real person but a meer representation of an ideal they will never be worse off than me. I just want to forget about them and move on but I can not. My feelings towards them make no sence. We where never close and I hardly know them and that knowledge also comes mostly from third parties. This has driven me to depression and total lack of motivatio. I want to get better but just am unable to."

I can't bring myself to function normally anymore. Things like eating and drinking water feel like daunting tasks for me. I've a long list of goals and tasks for the day and I can't even bring myself to get started on any one of them. I just end up staring at the screen for hours and have been lagging severely at work. I still live with my parents, given the covid situation and my career being extremely unstable. I'd go to therapy, but I'm scared as my parents would come to know and would insist on me telling them everything. I'm too terrified and overwhelmed to make changes of any kind and feel like things are spiraling out of control. I've been crying my eyes out the last five hours and I could just use some comforting words or advice from a stranger at the moment. I don't have anyone to talk to, be it friends or siblings."
1318,Why do I recently stutter a lot in speech and have a serious problem with concentration in class?," I'm a 24 years old female,I recently noticed that I struggle a lot whenever I have a conversation with my friends where I keep stuttering and jam words together and the concentration issue got even serious, I can't concentrate anymore in classes, I also tend to forget lately a lot of common things like my friends names or some actions I did in the morning or even some ideas while speaking.  


Can this be a psychological problem or physical one? How can I get back to normal without taking any meds.  


Fyi I didn't have any accident or trauma before, and I don't have anything worrying me more than this issue, I was healthy and could speak in a flowing way with no problem, but in july, 2018 after overworking for my final exams I got really sick (throwing up + first time having anxiety) so after that I did a blood work twice that showed abnormal results (high t4 \[29\] and normal tsh \[1.42\]), I repeated the same test 4 months ago in another laboratory and the results came normal and the doctor said that it could've been a mistake.  


Could this be related to my condition?  


Plz help this is starting to destroy my social life T\_T"
1319,Why do some people want traumatic things to happen to them?,"For example, losing a parent or physical abuse."
1320,Question for people in Germany,Hello ive heard from a friend of mine that in Germany some schools match you with three psycologist/therapists and you get like 10-15min short free session with them before you choose one whose right for you. I think this is a brillent system since (as many of you know) it is very difficult to find a therapist that i click with and the sessions are very expensive. Anyone in Germany who has experienced this system? How do you like it and what are pros/cons? Anyone from other countries who are aware of this kind of system? How do you guys feel abou tthis?
1321,nothing helps,"counseling was okay but i literally can't share my personal issues with anyone i'm so used to hiding it that i can't really talk about something even if i try very hard to. i mean that literally, when i try to talk about my problems in real life if it's a lot my brain will switch it out with something else or just stop me fromvtslking completely. also i tried anti depressants before and theh just made everything worse. i'm not sure what to do now. i know i'm strong enough to fix it on my own i just don't know how. i really am too close to giving up and just living like this forever but i don't want to. i hate crying it used to feel nice but now it feels like punishment. i don't like feeling so anxious and sad that not even watching my favourite youtubers can make me stop thinking of whatever it is that i'm trying not to think about. living where i am doesn't help at allceikther. my parents argue and yell at eachother every night even though they said they wouldn't do that anymore, my dad still smokes and drinks and i'm worried about him, my dog barks not far away from my room so i can hear it very clearly and loudly and i am scared of loud noises to the point i could cry and go quiet for an hour. i know that falls out of the original topic but i'm too scared to say that stuff to anybody else, i don't know why.
i wish i didn't feel so alone trying to be the way i was before but i got really used to hiding it from everyone and now even though i know people want to help me i don't believe them and i end up convincing myself that they can't deal with my problems as well as theirs which i do genuinely believe because it wouldn't be that surprising. i don't wanna keep having to feel like this but i don't know what to do anymore so maybe i will just have to get used to it."
1322,im desperate for advice,"hello friends, ive come here to hopefully seek advice from others who may be or have gone through the same thing I’m going through. nobody else in my life understands how i feel. im 15 years old to start off with, so i understand my problems are very little and have no meaning. but i don’t know how to get out of this knot. this past year i think i matured. my mindset shifted and i don’t think the same as i used too. i have all these stupid existential thoughts that won’t go away, and im questioning if im even living the correct way. 

im not gonna go off saying im depressed without seeing a mental doctor, but for these past months i have been acting real differently. all i find myself doing is sleeping, every single day. nothing catches my interest anymore like it used too, and my attention span has always been short. i rarely have the motivation to do my school work and make plans with people. im not eating as much as i used too, and i feel like i just overall lost a piece of me that i can’t get back. people have told me to try and go outside and find a hobby i like, but i have tried everything. carpentry, running, swimming, art, gardening, pottery, EVERYTHING. nothing ever sticks with me. and it’s worrying me because what about when i graduate? what will my lifelong career be? i have my parents constantly asking what im into and what my interests are, and i can’t tell them because i don’t know. i can tell my family’s disappointed in me, they watched their all A, smart, outgoing son turn into a anti-social hermit crab who can’t learn basic geometry. nothing seems to have purpose anymore, and i don’t know how to get out of this mindset. if anyone has ever struggled like this please reach out, i just need someone i can relate to. im driving myself insane"

1324,The other day my “best friend” said talking to me is a burden and I’m not sure how to feel about it,So the other day my best friend said to me that talking to me every day is a burden on her now she was a bit drunk when she said this but it really hurt my feelings and I haven’t spoken to her since and it’s been about five days. I’m going to refer to her as “PB” ok so a little about myself. I’m 22 years old and my whole life I’ve never had any friends as a kid growing up my family was very poor and we moved around a lot I went to 8 different schools and it wasn’t until high school that I actually stayed in one place longer than a year but I suffered a lot socially I was always an outsider and I never fit in anywhere even in high school I could hardly put a sentence together in front of someone and obviously this lead me to get bullied quiet a lot this along with my mum being a pill junkie and my dad being an alcoholic and plenty of other issues in my life I was and still am very depressed after about two years after I left school I fell into a very dark place to the point I wanted to take my life every day and this went on for about a year things had gotten that bad for me I was living on my brothers couch my brother is a total opposite of me and he all ways had people around but even then I could never talk to any of them it wasn’t until one day I came back from work and PB was in my kitchen with my brother and some other people (she was already good friends with my brother) I said hello and when straight to the lounge room and started playing Xbox we lived in a one bedroom flat btw so the kitchen and the lounge where one room so a few weeks pass and I see her a hand full of times but one night my brother decided to have a party and have 20 or so people over so I set up my computer and kinda just ignored all of it until PB came up and tapped me on the shoulder and said “come out side with me” I hesitated at first but she grabbed my hand and pulled me out side then she started talking to me and honestly for me this was a first know one had ever done this to me before and she wanted to know about me and to my surprise I was actually able to talk to her and we talk all night I’m serious the sun started coming up and we both went to bed but for the first time in my life I felt like someone cared for me I felt happy and we did this a lot sit up all night and talk about all sorts of stuff we told each other our secrets and we were both honest with each other then we started talking every day but it wasn’t like constant it would ether be in the morning or at night but we would talk every day this went on for a long time I told her about my depression and my suicidal thoughts and to my surprise she told me about hers and she even offered to take me to a doctor anyway PB was my best friend she means so much to me however I started to question it a little now PB is moving to a different state and that’s fine I knew she was doing that and I’m fine with it because it’s something she wants obviously I was very upset about it how ever one day out of the blue she calls me and asked me to come with her need less to say I was over the moon I was so excited and I planned on quitting my job and I saved all my money I was ready but then she didn’t quite say it but she emplyed that she didn’t want me to come with her witch upset me a lot and then she was going away for her bday and invited me last second and I feel like she only did because I was there when they were talking about it then after that our daily chats slowed down a lot becoming more like weekly chats and on top of that every time I ask her if she wants to hang out she never said no but she never said yes nether the usually the only time I would see her on the weekend is when she was drunk and need somewhere to hung out but even then she would ask me I would say yes and then she would ditch me and go hangout with my brother instead then last weekend I call her to see what she is doing and I guess for no reason she gets angry with me and says that talking to me is a burden honestly I’m very upset about it and honestly I feel like now I’ve just lost the one person I hold dear and if that the case I don’t really want to go on anymore I’ve just had enough I’m sorry this is really long and it’s probably all over and place and makes no sense I’m just not in the best mind set now
1325,Having a hard time distinguishing dreams from reality,"Last night I dreamt that I had to go buy some milk for a recipe the next day. When I got to the store, I got a bit confused. I was confused as to whether I really needed milk for the cake so I checked the recipe once again and it said no milk was needed. I bought it anyway, cause I clearly remember reading the recipe the day before and telling myself I shouldn't forget the milk! I truly believe that what I dreamt is real, but I know it can't be, because it doesn't make sense.

Sometimes I dream and then later in the day I think back on it and get confused as to whether it really did happen or didn't. Anyone else experiencing this? Btw, I constantly feel like I'm in a dream. I should note that I haven't slept much these past week, and last night I cried because I heard whispers and people talk outside my window. I really thought the alines were coming to get me."
1326,narcissistic intrusive thoughts?,"I got a lot of narcissisict intrusive thoughts now. It's really not under my control but I can't help having them each time I see someone vulnerable. It doesn’t have to be about people. One time I kept calling me a genius. I was crying because I could believe it from how naive I am (I thought I had a low IQ. It’s maybe not the case but I am often doubting my intelligence and was obsessed with the IQ topic a few months before.)

I keep searching for any comparaison to make or flaw about me, focus on it to bring myself down and try to stop those thoughts lol.. But yeah I feel like shit most of the time. I actually thought self-love and to compliment yourself overall were also pretty narcissisict. My mood is pretty much always on the extreme sides, rarely in the perfect middle (at least not for a long moment). I succeed to be comfortable in my body and to make peace with myself yesterday. I ended up being self-centred and having a bad time to recognize other people’s beauty. I just believed all people were ugly but me? After a while reality happily hit me back. 

That’s why I don’t want to get into the “love yourself” stuff. It always goes wrong with me. Plus it’s not that easy to find yourself beautiful when your physical appearance has so many imperfections. I’m too self-conscious to wear my skirt at school (I swear I never wore my skirt.. ) Or even to undress in the cloakroom (it’s not uncommon but all my other female classmates seem to be comfortable with it). I can assure you I’m insecure in real life.

1327,I’m depressed and stress but I’ve been laughing uncontrollably to the point of tears,"So lately a lot of things have been going wrong, I won’t list them all but whenever I talk to someone about one of these things I start laughing uncontrollably with big tears streaming down my face but the whole time I feel terrible about my current situations. For example yesterday my truck broke down (again) and when telling my brother about it I broke down into Insane laughter while crying. It’s happened a lot lately, is there something wrong with me? Am I having a mental breakdown?"
1328,Feeling myself becoming depressed how do I snap out of it?,"All was well at the start of the year, felt motivated and had goals.

Then I just started to feel weighed down with assignment due dates being in these first couple of weeks, sleep schedule has become very bad, uni housing has been weighing on me, tier 4 and on top of that my uni experience has been ruined by corona and I can't help feeling that it'll have a lasting impact on my time at uni, I've hardly made any friends. 

All of a sudden I'm going to bed at 3 waking up at 10:30 with this heavy horrible feeling, thinking 'whats the point'

I was doing so well at the end of last year and the start of this year, listening to podcasts, really motivated to get my life together, but now this. 

I really want to snap out of it before it really sets in, I have two essays due on Monday and have hardly started, I haven't felt this bad in 2/3 years

1329,I’m very lost,"The thought of killing myself has been on my mind for the last 12 years (I’m 22 now). The last two years have been really rough. I lost 45 pounds in a month last winter. My social skills have basically disappeared, I don’t talk to anyone other than my roommates and I barely talk to them. I sleep till 3 or 4 in the afternoon and stay up until 5 am. Every thought that comes into my head is negative all I think about is how I don’t plan to be here that much longer. I feel bad that I’m going to do that to my family. I want to go to a psychiatrist but I just got medical insurance and am pretty confused on how everything works and it’s just making me super stressed out. I think I need to go to a hospital. I’ve been telling myself that for years."
1330,Weight gain of 45% (57kg to 83kg) within less than two years,"Since I've started taking new meds about two years ago my weight skyrocketed. As someone who was underweight his whole life becoming suddenly overweight, this is absolutely frustrating. Labour tests showed that my liver doesn't do it's job properly anymore either.

Half a decade ago I was very athletic, which changed with the start of working life and massive depression leading to multiple months of stationary treatment. I'm still walking or riding thousands of kilometers every year, but guess that's not enough. Because I now have massive back pain I considered I'd start again with sports as long as my depression is bearable. Took my old sports clothing out, tried to put it on and... Holy shit I've become round.

Now I'm doing simple gymnastics in swimwear because I don't have anything else to do sports in lol."

1332,What does it tell about you if you see guys making fun of you and girls being fearful of you?,"A tough and maybe creapy question, but I truly see that. Kind of struggling with it today at work for one or another reason. Any experiences like that?"
1333,"Please, does anyone have experience with chronic physical pain as an expression of your trauma?","This might be a stretch or maybe I'm totally off base. My mom, in her 40s, has had a pretty hard life. Abandonment, constant abuse, extreme betrayal, in an emotionally abusive marriage now, deals with a lot of depression, grief (her mom's death), and fundamental insecurity. Between abandonment and abuse, as well as being confused because she doesn't seem to ever try to heal herself psychologically, she has a self-concept where she thinks she doesn't have value. No surprise, as her partner is abusive, gaslighting, sexist, disrespectful, demanding and ungrateful, unempathetic and possibly unfaithful. I know that she feels trapped, doesn't perceive a way to be free and is afraid of independence as they have been together since teens. She has a physical job and a lot of physical pain. Foot pain, back pain, shoulder pain. She is always at the doctor for her physical pain and acknowledges it. She has tried therapy but is not big on the idea of exploring her traumatic past even though to me it's obvious that she needs to. I know it is painful. She likes to push her emotions down, and then of course, she explodes. She is also diagnosed with Bipolar. She abuses my dad too, because she bites back at her oppressor. 

Anyway, I was talking to her about her acute shoulder pain today. I asked about the nature of the pain and she said ""the only way I can describe it, is it's like someone stabbed me in the back with a wooden stake, and the stake broke off and it's still lodged there."" When she said this I though immediately of the betrayal of her sister (she stole a lot of money, made us homeless, abused their dying mother, and then denied it, all for money etc). I was just wondering if the physical pain could perhaps be a manifestation of her psychological pain. The stabbed in the back feeling could also be related to the suspected infidelity of my father, as well as his ultimate failure to provide her with anything a partner needs to flourish. Instead, his behavior says ""you are nothing, you will have nothing, I deny you your personhood and divinity, you aren't allowed to be beautiful, you aren't allowed to have money or fun, you'll be locked in my house as a misunderstood slave who I will always put beneath me, mock, diminish, dismantle, neglect, accuse and torment"". He's a very stupid man. Not pure evil, but stupid and cowardly as shit. She once loved him and trusted him, when they were young, and this is how that turned out. A huge pile of shit, and his role in it disgusts me. Anyway, thoughts? I'd like it if my mother didn't have to be in excruciating physical and psychological pain for the rest of her life. She accepts being locked in a cage, because it's safer...I assume."
1334,At this point I just want to die,"I'm just so fucking tired man. It always feels like I'm trapped in my fucking head and it's hard to know which thoughts are mine anymore. When ever I feel even a little ok, my head starts telling me I'm faking it and that nothing's wrong with me. Yesterday night I couldn't stop fucking cutting myself and if a friend of mine hadn't been there, I would've done it. But now just, my head keeps pointing at all the ways I was faking it even though logically I know I wasn't but it's so damn hard to believe otherwise. It always feels like my pain is never enough and I'm just so done with everything. I'm tired of wondering whether or not I'm faking it, I'm tired of wondering whether I'm just a spoiled pathetic brat or if my pain is valid but god just I'm so fucking done."
1335,I was finally able to talk to someone after months of staying silent and hiding everything,"For the past couple of months my split personality has gotten worse. Breakdowns happened more often, the thought of self harm circulated in the back of my head and I felt like I was actually insane. I still do a bit but after finally talking to my friend it toned down alot. He was really understanding, offered me advice on alternate ways of coping and in general just REALLY supportive. I intended to tell him about my waifu as a coping method but didnt plan to go into detail but I ended up doing so anyway and he didnt judge at all. He wished the best for us two and after having that 2 hour long conversation last night I feel like a giant boulder has been lifted off my shoulders. If you're someone who is shy and secretive like myself, please talk to someone, anyone, it doesnt matter who. I havnt even told my parents yet but if it gets worse then I plan on telling them and looking into therapy. As of now my friend is the only one i know that knows of this. It might not be easy to find the courage to talk to someone but trust me it's really worth the gamble, the odds are in your favour. I am fully aware that it's impossible to just ""get rid of"" an alter but I feel like I have been pulled up and put on a platform to prevent me from falling further down into the pit."
1336,Hello! I’d like some advice on whether or not some problematic tendencies may be more “serious”,"I don’t have the right to be anything less than absolutely content. I’m extremely lucky in terms of the environment I’ve gotten to grow up in and the privileges I’ve experienced. I have no right to be depressed. It’s just- some minor symptoms are getting more exasperated  and I’m unsure of how to proceed.

Please forgive me for the long post and odd wording!

I started feeling extreme guilt for past happenings that date back years in the 6th grade. That led to quite a few sleepless nights of just staring at the ceiling and crying. I almost expected that? In that the teenage years were difficult and emotional. That was normal and a rite of passage of sorts. 

I think I got to my lowest in 7th grade where I came to the realization that I would be perfectly ok with simply disappearing. As in, if I were given the opportunity to die a painless death- I’d take it. That paired with a perpetual feeling of inadequacy led to me picking up the habit of scratching myself.

Nothing that would draw blood- just a few dig and drags across some skin. I didn’t feel like I deserve to be hurt. Sure, my performance may be woefully inadequate to the resource I’ve been provided but I wouldn’t hurt myself because of that. It was just something I noticed a lot of people did- self harm that is. I thought that if this was so universal across the board it might have some merit. And it did! The first time was euphoric. That’s the only word I’ve ever found to be able to describe it.

That continued for a bit until one day, I woke up and it all just stopped. At the time, I though that I was finally past that “phase” so to speak. But that led to a perpetual state of apathy. But this was manageable. My performance hadn’t been effected. Sure, my motivation levels have been progressively decreasing but that’s normal teenage laziness is it not? 

I was perfectly content to just go on as I had. I’m currently 16 and feel that it might be too early to seek help. This is a normal step in growing up isn’t it? Why waste the resources when it’s wholly unnecessary? It’s just- I can’t quite bring myself to care about anything. I know on a logical level that certain things are important to nurture and invest energy into but something just doesn’t connect. 

I’d greatly appreciate any advice and or perspective! Am I simply being too melodramatic? Or is this indicative of something a tab more serious?"
1337,Why do I get upset over smallest of things?,"I feel like every day is ruined by some tiny thing that i cry over. It's 12 and today has already been ruined because first, I tried to go for a drive but my car doors were frozen shut which caused me to be so angry I cried and went to bed. Then I had two five second ads on youtube and the second one made me cry and close my laptop. I always get either insanely angry or really sad. I think it might be something not normal but I'm not diagnosed with any illnesses. This happens literally daily. Also stuff like rejection really upsets me. Not like big rejections but stuff like me calling someone and them being busy or me asking someones opinion on like a dress I think about buying and them telling they don't really like it. It all gets me to tears. I'm just upset all the time, I can't handle anything."
1338,Anxiety Attacks,"Hello, I've been having non stop anxiety since yesterday and I haven't slept at all it's almost 7am here and when I try to go to sleep I feel my body just jump back up to wake me up because I feel like I'm falling. On top of that I can't stop shaking especially my legs and my heart rate goes up from like 92 to 105  at the most. Right now it's currently 100. I don't know what to do. Could someone help or send some positive encouragement."

Im now seriously considering killing myself in order for her to live a life without my abuse. Feel free to call me any horrible things in the comments, it will only help with my motivation"
1340,Problems during Lockdowns,"During all these lockdowns I’ve been focusing on this ringing in my left ear. Sometimes it flares up really bad and other times it’s not as noticeable.

Having not really left the flat in a year, I keep feeling like my hearing is going.

I feel like I’m going stir crazy."
1341,What should i do,"Lately ive been feeling rly down and i just thought it was the seasonal depression. but now my parents were gone for like three days and i was home alone with my sister. suddenly i felt energetic and did a lot of work for school and finally read a book again. i cleaned my room and was very motivated. now my parents are home again and i feel less energetic. i dont have an appetite anymore, feel unmotivated and can hardly get out of bed or do something else than watch series or youtube. so clearly my mood depends on my parents. but what can i do against it? should i talk to them about it or should i work on this problem on my own? how do i even overcome this mood? ur help would be appreciated :)"
1342,Grieving in Lockdown,"My mum died last year, and my country has harsh lockdowns (and I am very cautious) I see lots of articles on grieving, but not on grieving in isolation. The steps articles recommend are not available to me.

I'd like to know other's experiences of this. Not to do with corona, or death, but just the process of grieving in a pandemic while being isolated.

It was one year ago yesterday that she died, and yesterday I feel like I couldn't cry, yet there was heaviness I couldn't express.  
I don't know if actually, I've just never stopped grieving all year since there's no distractions and I've only seen even my family a handful of times.  
Or if I've been pushing the grief down because it's hard to deal with that on top of everything else and I don't feel safe.  
Or if I'm just dealing with the grief well but am holding onto trying to still be sad about it.

I feel like in comparison I felt much better shortly after she died, that I could just cry without trying, get it out of my system and then feel calm. I don't know whats even there emotionally anymore. 

It would be nice to hear others experiences."
1343,I'm a pedophile and I need help,"I'm a pedophile who has been convicted of using child porn in the past and I am red lining in my self management. I Canadian and I need Canadian help. 

I am not close nor have access to any minors, let alone the the empty place I live in. I haven't and am not seeking to engage in any activity with any minors.

I am however fantasizing, and it is concerning for me as I don't want to get in trouble.

I've used Google, but there isn't any real resource regarding pedophilia that I'd like to see from a doctor. Does anyone or is anyone in contact with someone that is able to help someone who is in urgent help regarding pedophilia?

I know, bullet, FBI, 911, and blah blah blah. I need something serious please."
1344,feeling worthless //tw : suicide,"recently i've been feeling down, school just started and each day feels like it's been going on forever, and every day just feels like a repeat of the other.  
the instant i entered my school i felt like shit, and had lost all motivation in life.  
i feel bored, worthless and just unmotivated.  
i can't talk to my friend group, since there are two people there i fucking hate, who make me feel like shit.  
i've been thinking about killing myself, i just want to disappear and stop feeling anything.  
i don't have anyone to talk to at school,  and i have no motivation to learn, and having adhd just makes it worse.  
i don't know what to do with my life anymore, i don't really have anyone to talk to, and time just goes by so fucking slowly  
idk how much longer i can deal with this"
1345,Probably will get dementia because I'm a loner by nature.,"I pushed my former crush away recently. Mainly because she's overseas and it was stressing me out. We were talking for over a year doing video calls once a week, but I think she only views me as a friend, but I wanted a relationship with her. I told her how I felt at the end of the year only to get her to leave me hanging. (I took it as rejection and blocked her).

I grew up autistic and without a mother (she died at 3), with some mental health problems. Because of my frustrating disorder, I could never find a good way to show interest. Now, I'm just out there trying to focus on investing for retirement. 

I don't feel close to my family and I don't hang out with friends as much. I've noticed my cognitive decline and I'm ok with it getting worse and possibly give me a shorter life expectancy. I'm ok with this. I've already reached 33, and went through the scars of lonliness and misery. They can't hurt me anymore. 

I like to go to bed early and sleep on weekends. (Especially in the winter). I experienced ahnedonia recently. Now I'm just waiting to see what 2021 will do."
1346,is a psychiatrist more expensive than a therapist?,"my therapist is nice and all but i don’t think therapy’s for me because it feels like i can’t absorb or understand anything and i don’t want to continue being a waste of money. and when my mum was asking me about therapy, she suggested a psychiatrist once i told her. i thought about it and i’m down to try it but i want to know if it’s worth the price."
1347,Update!,"Good day. I am the guy who started meditating in the morning and reading in the evening. I just want to say that in a week, this routine changed my humor. I am more happy and less anxious. I look at the future with hope and tend to be less and less lazy. 

I can't believe my life could change this quick with simple things. ⭐"
1348,i thought i would take this to the grave...,"I am honestly so disgusted with myself about this that i have never told a soul. i never want to but i know talking about it will make me understand it.

It has been a fantasy my entire life about how my life is a movie. I would be a catalyst for movie plots but in the most disgusting way possible. I would hurt myself, hurt others, use others in order to satisfy my fantasy. I want to kill myself because of what I've done.

The first thing I did was self harm. why? because i saw my friend do it and saw how others cared for her. I wanted that attention for myself. It soon blew over when I understood how serious it was. the cuts weren't deep and no one ever noticed.

Then it got worse, when I remembered the time I broke my arm and people cared for me. I wanted people to care for me again and so I tried  braking my arm.

Then there was the most disgusting of all. I purposely bruised my eye, knowing people would suspect that I was being abused by my loving parents who care for me and done a lot for me. But nevertheless I wanted people to think that, I wanted them to think I was abused and broken. I am so sorry if you have been abused, I am so sorry. Please forgive me.

Once I was diagnosed with depression, I didn't want to keep it to myself.  EVERY time I was drunk I would tell people I was depressed and suicidal. I also self harmed again to satisfy the vision that I was indeed, very broken. I wanted to be viewed that way. So I would isolate myself, knowing people saw me isolated, suggest to people I was suicidal. I hate this life and what I'm doing with it. And I hate that im feeding off of real life pain that real people have actual encounters with. I hope those people can forgive me. Please someone tell me, what the hell is going on?"
1349,Can’t do it today.,"I have been remodeling the house I grew up in, as I am currently unemployed. Working for my parents next to nothing. It’s a 2.5 hour round trip and I worked there for 11 hours yesterday. I can’t do it today. I need the money but I can’t bring myself to get up and leave. I’m considering staying home and looking at the job boards all day but that could have it’s own set of anxiety that comes with it... 

This year has been hard. My industry has suffered and I have been laid off twice. The third job I landed ended up pushing my start date to the first of the year and then that didn’t even happen. I’m at the end of my rope here. I think I need to just take a day to cry. 

Please don’t be a jerk. I’m really struggling this morning."
1350,"Switching meds, can’t tell if what I’m feeling is a side effect or because I’m switching meds.","Hey guys. I have BPD and bipolar. I take Wellbutrin, lamotrigine and mianserin and recently started taking Topamax. I was on valproic acid before but it interacted with my thyroid medication so I had to get off it. 

I’m on topamax for over a week and a half, maybe a bit more, just started taking the appropriate dose for the past three days. I got some of the side effects. I haven’t had the easiest time recently just bc of some personal stuff but I’ve been feeling like SHIT and I can’t tell whether it’s because I’m switching the meds or because of the Topamax. I read somewhere that Topamax can induce suicidal thoughts and worsen depression as a side effect but I don’t wanna annoy my psych just  in case this is completely normal. 

When I switched meds in the past (ADs not mood stabilisers), I took it pretty hard but kinda had myself to blame bc I went off them way too quick. This time I did it correctly but maybe it’s normal idk 

I know I shouldn’t get too hung up on what I read on the internet but obviously I had to google it so now my anxiety is through the roof. I’ve always been on the same mood stabilisers so idk if it’s normal. Anyone have any experiences to share? 

Thank you!"
1351,Is it a cowardly thing that I want to relocate to a whole different country for the sake of my well being and mental peace?,"As you know a lot people worldwide have been affected by this pandemic. In my neighborhood all kinds of shady stuff takes place like drug deals and brothels. My mental health is a mess and I'm worried about the future. I keep on being vocal about mental health but no one takes me seriously. Some days my anxiety is so bad that I don't wanna wake up. Some days I feel like ending it all.

1353,I’m so close to losing it... so close,"Lately I just can’t deal with anything anymore, I feel like life is as difficult as putting a thread on a needle naked in the arctic...
Nothing excites me, nothing touches me, I am somewhat of a shut-in, I don’t even wanna know my screentime on my devices, my best friend is my cat, I am very full of myself and always assume I am the smartest in the room, simultaneously I always think I am the dumbest and worst in the room, I am really a perv, I can’t love anyone or I love someone until the person loves me then I lose interest, I often wish I had superpowers so that I can manipulate people too leave me alone...I just want a simple quiet life.
I hate everyone around me right now and I feel like I can’t do anything anymore, all I do is surf on the internet, and my schoolwork won’t be done aswell, I have math homework and know for a fact I won’t do it until tomorrow.
Any tips on how I might get down to earth and get my life together?
Meditation? Coaching? Anything?
Thx in advance"
1354,What is this feeling called?,"I had this feeling of wanting to die, being upset and crying, super stressed. Then my brain kicked in this feeling and i feel nothing, i have no opinion on anything, no emotions towards anyone or anything,i just stopped caring about everything, and i feel kinda happy. It doesn’t last, the other feelings will come back. but what is this called and why does my brain do it?"
1355,Should i talk about it,"Feeling lost for several months and I’ve been keeping it to myself. So, should i find someone that I could talk about it? Just wanna find myself back."
1356,Always feel depressed after a vacation/time off,"I’m not sure if this is a common feeling or some kind of known condition.

Every time I come back to work after some time off (Christmas break, vacation, etc) I always feel sad for reasons that I can’t explain. I’ll be doing fine and then suddenly I’ll get this wave of butterflies/anxiety and sadness rush over me. When I leave the house in the morning to head to work I’ll often break down and cry in the car and I can’t explain why. Usually after 2-3 weeks of getting back in the routine of work ill be fine. 

I’ve rationalized it to myself by telling myself that it’s just because going back to work after a break is a shock to my system and I miss the time off/being with family and relaxing. I tell myself that this feeling of sadness is my body’s way of telling me “hey go back to relaxing that was way better than this” 

The thing is I don’t dislike my job, I actually enjoy it overall. Sure every job has its downsides and stressors but overall I like coming to work and contributing to my team and goals. 

Not sure if anyone else experiences this?"
1357,Don’t know where to turn..,It’s 6 am here and I’m sitting in my car alone trying not to cry and could really use someone to talk to right now. I messed up last night and I feel really lost.
1358,WTF? Should I even go to bed?,"Well stayed up til my usual 4-5 AM then I notice I’m up til 9AM? Uhh very unusual for me and I never pull all nighters and I have to work in a few hours....

Strange thing is I smoked a lot of weed today but I also stayed up watching random shit on YouTube... god help me"
1359,I feel like a hypochondriac for mental health,First of all I’ve been diagnosed as bipolar although I didn’t push for that. But it was diagnosed as a result of some unusual behaviour that I’ve had over the course of a few years which I was told was mania. I am on medication for it and I’m mostly fine now. I had one episode in a few years and it was only mild. I seem to always find labels and research them and I’m sure I have it. For a week I could be convinced I have social anxiety the next depression and at the moment it’s low self esteem. I’m focusing on snapping out of that though and at the moment I’m focusing on my diet and exercise. I have achieved a lot recently and lots of people are proud of me but I have at times put myself down or see myself as inferior to others.
1360,"Crashing to rock bottom, then bouncing up - why does this happen?","Hello! I have a question I've wondered for years about. I'm in my 30s, and this has happened for the past... 20 years or more. I have done medications and doctors, and I do have diagnoses, but I'm curious about one symptom specifically. Every so often, I hit a point where I feel the absolute worst with depression, sometimes disassociation, anxiety... Then the next day, I feel a little better than I have for a while. It's like the only way I can feel good is to crash first.  


Sometimes it even happens many times on a smaller scale within in the same day, where it's almost like my brain is fighting feeling better. I will start to feel happy or okay, then I get nauseous and jittery, repeat all day long.. I have been assessed for bipolar I and II a few times and did not meet the criteria as I do not experience mania. My ""ups"" are not mania, just feeling like things will be okay, maybe sort of happy.   


Medications did not help me. I usually manage it (sort of) now with breathing or grounding exercises and distraction. But it's still not... great... And I'm curious what could cause it neurologically or chemically so maybe there is a better way to manage it, whether that's medication or lifestyle changes.   


Does anyone else experience this or know what it might be? The only thing I could guess is something to do with dopamine but I don't know why that would happen."

1362,Losing,"Okay so, i am losing myself for real. I am killing myself slowly but i like it. i begin to laugh at the damage i bring. i dont even want to be saved. i want to die. 

yea... even my mind dont know what to do anymore. it is always incosistent.

how i went here?

father got killed when i was 3 years.

got sexually abused by a man and woman from 7 to 10 y/o.

mother is an alcoholist. (understandable because she had traumas in her life)

got bullied by my own fam? (yup thats a thing)

mother also had cancer.

got bullied at school.

important person in my life also had cancer. (always felt like it was my fault (it still does))

always felt alone (i literaly talk to materials... (talked to my hats and jewellery and didnt think that was weird))

got mentally abused by someone (recently... and that totally broke me)

money problems due to not having a job anymore because of the corona.

apparently got a chronic depression and ptsd.

never had the will to live.

the thing that kills me the most is to se everyone i love being depressed or something like that. i never heard someone say that they are happy.

i feel worthless. i feel alone. i feel stuck."

1364,Social anxiety is ruining my life,"Hi everyone. So I am a 22 years old Male and I feel like social anxiety is ruining my life. I never had social anxiety until I was 21 and then for some reason it hit. I used to be so outgoing, I  loved to meet everybody and loved to have a good time and now I can’t even drive or walk down the street without feeling like people are judging me left and right. I think I’m fat even though I’m Only 145 pounds and everybody that sees me says I need to eat more or I’m going to shrivel up. I’ve had 4 jobs just since the start of covid because I can’t hold a job. I just feel so bad about myself all the time and it’s starting to take a toll. Anybody else with social anxiety have any suggestions or anything they do that helps? I know all of my thoughts are unrealistic and I know I’m not fat and I know that people are not judging me but for some reason I think they are. I’ve considered getting on a medication but I wanted to get your opinions and ideas that have worked for you. Thx!"
1365,Am I manipulating my partner because I’m depressed?,"My mental health over the last year has been deteriorating and I’m really not okay. I’ve hurt myself many times and lately my thoughts are just plain scary. (I have a history of panic attacks and depression so it’s not new feeling) I shared how I’ve been feeling with my partner and he tells me I’m being over dramatic, yells at me and says to just figure my shit out because its not his problem. He mentioned that what I’m doing is manipulating. Is it? Should I not tell him about how I’m feeling?"
1366,I am not sure what it is. But I know its something in my head,"For over 6 months I keep getting what I believe are anxiety attacks. But I'm not sure. I usually start to get super dizzy. Its to the point where I am scared that I am going to pass out or have a seizure or something. 

Then right after I will start to get extremely paranoid and scared. I will look around because I feel like someone is standing right behind me. I have even gotten to the point where I feel like I'm on the edge of hallucinating. Obviously caffeine makes it worse. 

I'm not sure what to do. I am refusing to go anywhere because I am scared that I will get an attack while driving or with my friends. I just want my life back. If there is anyone that can at least identify what this could be that would be great. Hopefully if I at least know what it is, I can try and cure it."
1367,Sex addictions and mental health?,"So glad I found a mental health sub that promotes user entries. I'm really having trouble with the last lecture we received on zoom today. 

My psychology professor is having us study Jeffrey Epstein, Harvey Weinstein and other high profile celebrities convicted of sex crimes. 

We just finished a zoom meeting in which he gave us the meaning behind the lesson. In his words ""sexual feelings are regulated by chemicals from the brain. If the Gay's and transsexuals cannot control their sexual preference and identities, neither can a man with all the money in the world. The issue with sex crimes not only in this country *US* but around the world is that the general population shuns those with sex addictions. Now I don't advocate for those who hurt children or others just because they can't say no to their libido. The underlying issue is that even those with the most money suffering from these sexual irregularities, the highest profiled members of governing, no matter who you're you'd rather be convicted of murder than to admit to anyone that you are sexually attracted to children/animals etc. That's the problemwith this type of mental health. In this current mental health information campaign sweeping the world, it's incumbent upon you young parents and future parents to make the world as safe for the children as possible. If we continue to jail sexual offenders without proper therapy and mental Healthcare; the system creates re-offenders. If a man has a drug addiction and is arrested for this drug addiction, how does this help in a future scenario where he's surrounded by these drugs. Recidivism is always a problem, but jail does not fear those who are mentally sick. It may scare me or you from grabbing a random woman by the p***¥, but someone who is mentally sick will not be scared too easily. Look at the way we police child offenders. After finishing a jail sentence they're put under strict parole. I do believe some state policing agency should babysit these offenders, but that's not what's happening. Offenders are told they're never allowed to knowingly be in range of another child, can't live near schools etc. If someone has a drug problem, since when has taking away the drug ever been the only answer. In some cases they can't fully take away the drug due to dependencies. What kind of dependencies does sexual crimes provide? Power? Lust? Childhood trauma etc. All things we speculate, but we've never once decided to take a look at the science in sexual offenses and how they may relate to a further mental illness. I'm not saying anyone gets a pass, I'm simply saying that there's no way to protect your child not knowing who suffers from these mental illnesses. Offenders will continue to hurt others, these same others are also likely to develop mental illness and possibly become the same person as the persons who offended them. Hurt people hurt people and until we get to the bottom of why these offenders do what they, people will continue to get hurt creating a cycle with children who may develop mental illness as a result.""

- paraphrase. 

This is as much of the lecture I can remember, please share your thoughts as I'm sure my classmates along with me were very against his lecture to begin but he makes a good point. When will this all end? Can we study their brains, the way chemical reactions are performed throughout the day and get therapist notes on their childhood to find out if they were ever a victim of abuse. This one hit me real close to home as my major is childhood psychology."
1368,so uhh i came across something and i don’t know how to feel about it,"basically i was on youtube and i saw a video called something along the lines of “suicide 911 call”. I was expecting it to be a video where someone called 911 because they were about to commit suicide but hen they get talked out of it and it’s all heartfelt and stuff (i usually get videos like that) but instead it turned out to be much worse... It was a 911 call of a little girl (she sounded maybe around 9 years old?) calling 911 because she found her brother dead (he used a gun as well, which is admittedly more traumatic to see) and it was just.. horrible. it was horrible and heartbreaking and even made me feel sick to hear that little girl crying out for her brother... at one point she even yells “Why did you do it?” and it broke me. i just... i don’t really know how to feel right now. I guess i never really thought about what would happen after i was gone. Obviously i’ve thought about how people might react and stuff but i never thought about how i’m would be found... 
sorry if this is off topi for the subreddit, i didn’t really have anywhere else to go..."

1371,My girlfriend has different personality’s I’ve noticed (3) but yesterday she randomly said “who am I?” And finally showed her true self to me,"As it says in the title she was able to show her self and take control. While she could, she said that “when I’m not In control and they (the other personality’s) take over, I can see, feel and remember everything they do. But I can’t take control. I have thoughts for myself but it’s like I’m just their. They aren’t aware of there own or my existence. (they don’t share memories and only aware of them selves. By the way they are all completely different and behave, act and feel all different things. The only common factor is that they all want to die (all at different degrees) and that they all love me. The thing is tho is that the real girlfriend doesn’t want to die. Anyways back to it) It’s like I’m a spectator getting blocked by this wall I can’t climb” 
I think that’s what she said. But can anyone help tell me what this all means. I’m pretty sure it’s DID but I’ve never heard or seen something like this. And don’t say stuff like “she needs therapy” because I know. Thanks for the read! And thanks for any help"
1372,it feels like theres two of me,"ive heard about borderline personality disorder and such and im going to bring it up with my therapist but it feels so weird and uncomfy to have this other person in my head with me. its not like theyre completely seperate, i think theyre me but at the same time i can talk to them? i tried doing it with a google doc and it helped regulate who was talking (me or the other me) and i feel a little crazy? i also feel like maybe im faking it somehow??? i dont know if its just my dumb overactive imagination combined with my immense loneliness creating someone thatd actually talk to me or if im literally going insane. I feel very anxious and its sort of like ive had them there for a while in a way? and its me but its like im not completely in charge of those thoughts or there always a different stream of them?

TLDR; it feels like theres another person in my head and i feel very crazy at the moment."

I did research and think I have IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder). I know i should ask my mom to get a professional diagnosis, but I’m scared she won’t believe me."
1374,Requesting a change in psychiatrist - what should I write in my letter?,"I am requesting a change in psychiatrist. The one I had been seeing previously is one that I had also seen years ago. I feel that he did not take my issues seriously and told me that my depression and anxiety is mainly due to lack of confidence etc - basically tried to dull down all of my symptoms making me feel that my issues were invalid. This was during a critical time as I was dealing with a lot of sh, thoughts that I don’t want to be here anymore etc.
My question is, does anyone have any tips on what to write in my letter to change consultants? I don’t want to write anything that will hurt my previous psychiatrist’s feelings, but I also want to reiterate the fact that I did not feel that he validated just how bad I was feeling.
I felt that there was a communication barrier and that I could not open up to him, as he felt that my issues were superficial.
Any advice on what to write in the letter would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance. I hope you are all well."
1375,Something feels wrong,"I am 15 and I am diagnosed with autism, and have symptoms of anxiety depression and adhd that I'm being treated for, but something still feels really wrong.  I frequently have foreign thoughts that feel like they aren't me, but are still thoughts, and I've had them for quite a while (about a year), but they have been getting more destructive and telling me to do things I would never do, like destroying things or killing myself.  They are getting more distressing, and when they get bad enough I can't do anything and just lie there.  I have had more and more trouble expressing emotion, I often sleep instead of doing things, and I have basically no energy on bad days.   On good days I feel still know the thoughts are there, but I just go on like nothing is wrong, and bad days are debilitating.  I have repeatedly tried to tell my Parents, and they tell me to exercise and eat more.  My therapist insists that we do the therapy and not focus on what is actually wrong.  I feel like I need more therapy or another therapist or at least some kind of professional opinion, but I can't get it because of my parents, and I can't just turn myself into the ward for a while because of my parents being afraid of covid."
1376,Does any find it hard to collect themselves when they are having a huge rush of anxiety?,"I've observed that whenever I'm worried about how things will turn out and I start start having anxiety about something, it's very hard for me to collect myself.

It has been very hard, for all the family members especially my lil bro who was very close to her. Just recently he started showing signs of depression especially since his exams are approaching, he is not finding the willpower to study as he used to take help from mum who now is not there, and so that stress, is weighing down on him thereby causing his depression. I am very worried about him. If anyone could please give me advice as to how I can help my brother deal with his depression, I would really appreciate it."

1383,Lost a friend,"I just found out today that a classmate of mine passed away. She fell off the third floor; her leg got tangled up in some wires and she just slipped and fell and died. She was a sweetheart, always helped people and a very bright kid. I don't really know how I feel; it's like I'm having trouble breathing. Life constantly reminds me how unfair and unpredictable it is. Rest easy R, you were an angel."
1384,Which is an appropriate reaction to someone revealing they suffered or still suffer because of something?,"I mean, an answer that can make them feel better but does not minimize nor ignore the problem. Something that leaves the possibility to face the problem open, without making them worry or feel inadequate.

E.g. if a person you know reveals you they struggle with accepting their appearance to the point they have been to the therapist, what should you say? ""I like you anyway"" makes it all about you and minimize it; ""I understand"" or ""I'm with you"" add nothing, it's not of any help, especially if you are close; ""That's not true"" or ""you're ok this way"" vanish the whole thing that made them suffer, like it was pretended...

I don't want them to feel bad but I don't know how to approach the question"

1386,Low grade depression &amp; anxiety,"I've been dragging my feet for the past couple of months/years through what seems to be a fog of high stress spikes and grayness.

I wake up unhappy every morning thinking about work, even on days off. My job is amazing on paper and everything I wanted, but I feel isolated and worried all the time. I don't feel good about my achievements and it's projecting onto my family.  
I am worried about making mistakes, or realizing I have done a poor job in past projects in hindsight, and it is driving me crazy. I am even afraid that upon embarking on new projects I will discover mistakes with old ones.

On top of everything my company keeps adding policy and rules and it's really hard to keep up and make sure what I do is compliant, and I've been stressing over that as well, or sometimes new projects take me way too long because I am trying to figure out how to accomplish them while being compliant. In a sense I feel that everyone expects me to be the expert in the room but I seldom know what I am doing!

Sight. I wish I could quit and just not work, but career is such a big part of my identity, and also there is the issue of money which we increasingly need nowdays.

I also feel isolated, in terms of not seeing anyone outside my immediate family, not being able to see my parents who live overseas and generally incredibly lonely. I was lonely before COVID but now I am lonelier. I have my spouse and young kinds, and they are great, but this is all I have. No extended family or friends. I have distant friends who all disappeared and family who is distant or overseas.

Just wanted to rant a bit, thanks!"
1387,Drawn-out Grief?,"TW: Death/Suicide/Self harm 

My mother (my absolute best friend) passed away at the age of 49. I was 22. She was pronounced dead at 12 am/May 26th of 2018 and buried June 1st of 2018. Her birthday is June 4th, mine is June 23rd. She passed away on the date of her best friend’s birthday (who passed away in 1994). I am mentioning these dates so it can be expressed how depressing (in my eyes) the death was and the events surrounding it. 

Cause of death: Septic shock

I was the one who had to make the decision to remove her from life support (alone, as we lived 2 hours from any family), there was no saving her. I have a half-brother (same mother) but he was incarcerated during her death and funeral - he is serving 6 - 20 years. 

It’s been almost 3 years since she passed. I did really well the first month after her death, didn’t even cry at the burial. I know this can be normal but I’m pretty sure having deep depression over a death 3 years later, isn’t “normal”. I even had a plan to commit suicide on May 26th of 2020 - couldn’t handle the pain of not having her. That obviously didn’t happen. I have a history of burning myself with hot lighters when things get bad mentally. 

But I want opinions from others before I consider this abnormal. I mean, who has breakdowns 3 years later? Shouldn’t I have grieved fully by now?"
1388,I can not take mental illness seriously because of online influencers (youtubers etc...) + other factors .,"Ok , first of all let me say I believe in mental illness and what people go through, I myself have severe anxiety and had my own share of issues with it. Recently I started doubting people claims about 'mental health' because of internet influencers. I just feel like everyone online is trying to rub their mental health in people faces and use it to justify their actions or gain sympathy in an argument. Such actions really take away from the whole mental health awareness and made me who is a firm believer of mental health and its daily affect to question some people integrity. A while ago some internet celebrity had some accusation of p\*dophilia this individual tried to justify his actions  by claiming he was a victim of sexual assault and had 'depression and other mental issues'. This is one of many cases.

What I noticed is that people who are actually dealing with mental health never bring it up and only open about it when asked or if there is a reason to do so. Meanwhile there are others who just try to rub it in everyone face, and at that case I can not take them seriously as rude as this sound. I wonder if people feel the same ? That some individual try to use mental health as a excuse or to gain sympathy?  

 Tl;dr , Nowadays many people try to use mental health to justify their actions and this is drifting me away from mental health awareness."

I know we're back into lockdown.  Does this sound like anxiety behaviour"

1391,What has happened to me in the last 5 days?,"I'm 18 f, Since I was 12/13 I've always been filled with such severe anxiety about everything, and I've never told a single person. I couldn't talk to people I've just met and I've rarely been able to post things on social media for fear of being judged online, even though I could rationally tell myself that's the anxiety I just could never do it. I'm insecure about my body, face, clothes I wear, music I listen to and my name sometimes, everything...

On the 2nd of January I stayed up all night because I was bingeing a tv show, something I do fairly often, then suddenly I got really bad sinus pressure the next day and that lasted for about 2 days, in which I was unable to fall asleep or eat. I became shaky and I couldn't think at all. It then got worse as I actively stopped myself from sleeping for some fucked up reason that my brain decided on, which kinda makes sense as I self-harm, then on the fourth, I completely lost it and had a panic attack. I've only had one panic attack before and that was a few years ago.

That night was the strangest night of my life, at this point I was desperately trying to fall asleep as I was now hallucinating from the lack of it, which then meant I didn't sleep again and I was getting more and more anxious about falling asleep. The morning of the 5th I went downstairs to my kitchen and my dad asked me if I was alright. That question became obsolete to me because for as long as I can remember, whenever asked I always say yeah I'm good as a reflex even when I was feeling suicidal in 2018/2019 because I never wanted my family to know I suffer from mental illness. But for some reason, I just said no, and I didn't even know I said it, I then started crying and obviously my dad made me talk to him. I didn't tell him the whole truth because I really don't want my parents to know about my mental health for their sake, but for the very first time in my life I answered are you okay truthfully. Then after that, I realized that by talking to my dad, he actually helped me with a problem id been having.

A monumental shift then happened in my mind. Before this week, I've wanted to have anxiety which I never understood, I've felt like a fraud when reading about mental illness because I actively wanted it for some completely unknown reason to me. And that's when i suddenly realised that my wanting to have anxiety is the anxiety talking! And I've never seen that thought before, anywhere. 

On Twitter, I constantly saw people saying that you don't want anxiety, stop pretending you do, which I 100% agree with. But there was that part of me that wanted to have anxiety that made me feel like I was faking it.

And now all of a sudden I've never thought clearer in my entire life. My entire brain makes sense to me now, and I realized how deadly anxiety is. I now see it as a completely different part of me and I finally understand what is meant by I have to kill a part of myself in order to survive. The mental illness is trying to survive in my head.

 I've never put that together before and that's why I suddenly feel this way. I genuinely feel like a completely different person.

I still haven't been able to sleep, and my hands are shaking like crazy, I'm having about a hundred thoughts a second right now, and my short term memory right now is pretty bad, but I feel like I've somehow done some sort of exorcism of my mental illness this week, and the feeling is one of the best I've ever felt in my life. I haven't been able to go on walks in public for a while because I was worried people were looking at me and judging me, yet I went for a walk today I didn't care. I haven't been able to be myself in front of my family and now I'm experiencing it for the first time. And now I resent my mental illness, a thing I actively wanted to have. I see what it's done to me for the first time in my life. I finally recognize that I don't have to feel this way and I feel completely free for the first time in what feels forever and don't really know how to process this. And now I'm beyond terrified of going back into my original mindset.

this has taken me ages to write as I cannot think clearly due to lack of sleep, but I desperately want to know what the hell I've just done, These last 5 days have felt like a decade for me."
1392,How to deal with breaking an unhealthy relationship pattern?,"Hi im 19 (NB) I have had many relationships in my life, healthy or not. However i have bpd, trauma, and GAD. My mother wasnt in the picture and abandoned me for drugs. My dad was a functional neglectful angry alcoholic who preached my intense emotions were wrong but he was silly and lovable. My sister put me down everyday of my life. I became a person at an early age who was obsessed with love. I fell in love with anyone really. Super huge crushes. When i got older and got in relationships, i soon realized I had bpd. After dealing with lots of issues and continuing to do so i have noticed a pattern in my relationships that has jeopardized most of my last relationships. When me and someone mostly male would have our 1 year dating anniversary, soon after they would break up with me or i would become interested in someone new and leave them. I finally have a pretty healthy relationship. Not perfect and we have had some nasty fights (nothing too crazy) started usually by me spilting on him. I am still working on it and hes been very patient and happy with my success with this. Hes very kind and i realized when i tend to stablize my own emotions or try to resist my need to control others that we have less arguments if any at all. Hes made me very happy and I would like to go farther with him since weve been living together for awhile comfortably but a pattern emerged. I am starting to doubt our relationship since it hit one year together. Not that anything is wrong, in fact im so happy in my relationship. Its the nagging thoughts like ""Hes going to get bored of you"" ""Hes not good for you"" ""Hes going to cheat on you eventually"" ""Im not enough"" I start freaking out at the slightest fight or anything like im trying so desperately to cling on to him but itll push him away. I want to know what to do because my mind is scary good at convincing me im right when im wrong. I see a future with him and so does he. I dont want this pattern to ruin my relationship. Please help thanks!!"
1393,I don’t know how to express my feelings,"I feel suffocated. I never tell people how I feel. Not even my close friends or family. I feel like I have my guard up all the time. 

When I was younger, I was really clumsy and would trip over my own feet all the time. And whenever my dad saw that I was hurt, he would scream at me for getting hurt and tell me that it was my own fault for being so clumsy. Since I tripped a lot, I got yelled at a lot. I think because of that, I learned to never tell people when I felt hurt and even now I still don’t know how to talk about when I’m feeling sad or down."
1394,Finally got an official diagnosis,"TLDR; Diagnosed with bipolar disorder today by my psych, my meds are working, I feel good, and I’ve gotten some closure. 

Had my second appointment at with my psychiatrist this morning and got officially diagnosed as having bipolar. I’m definitely a rapid cycler (if I had to guess, daily. Up during the day and hard crashes at night).

She started me initially on fluexatine (Prozac) and Buspirone and it got rid of the anxiety but immediately upswing me into mania. It was BIZARRE. I’d never experienced mania without anxiety so had no clue what was going on. Called my mom (who also has rapid cycle bipolar) and she confirmed it was mania. Called my psych, got off the fluexatine and Buspirone, and started the oxcarbazepine (trilaptol) and immediately leveled out. I can sleep. I can eat. I’m not anxious. I’m feel level and low key. I distinctly still FEEL. my friend bought me the complete series of the office because it’s not on Netflix anymore and I cried happy tears. So can confirm with certainty that the feelings are still there!

Because I swung up into mania immediately (literally less than a week) after starting the antidepressants confirms that I for sure have bipolar disorder. I’m not surprised (mom has bipolar, aunt has BPD, gma likely had one of the two as well) but it feels good to have some closure and a medical diagnosis. I’m happy my meds are working and I feel level and NORMAL. My friends have noticed I talk slower and am just...happier and more level. I just have some closure and feel real good about it. Thanks for listening!"
1395,Something's wrong with my brain.,"I've been depressed for a long time now, probably 5 or 6 years (I'm 20 now). I didn't speak to anyone about my mental health for that long until I told my mom everything 4 months ago and she sent me to therapy. I liked it, but it was a one-session thing, so I didn't go back.

Ever since I went there my brain feels dumb. I feel like I've just woken up all the time, I can't think quickly or do maths, my mind feels foggy and numb. It's like when you know you can make the effort to understand something but you don't want to because you're lazy? Except when I really want to, I can't.

I read months ago that untreated depression can cause brain damage (don't know if it's true) and I'm scared. I also feel like maybe this is kind of a shock reaction? I basically isolated myself for years and then spoke everything out loud, maybe it was just too overwhelming.

Along the same line, I can't feel anything either. It's like my emotions are blocked off. I can cry with movies or books (especially on my period) but I swear if a loved one died right now I wouldn't cry. I wouldn't feel a thing. I know I'm supposed to be sad but I just feel... nothing at all. And not just for negative feelings. Some guy says he likes me and I can't feel butterflies or embarrasment or anything, not for him or for anyone else. I feel like a monster.

What's wrong with me? Why did my feelings and brain shut off?"
1396,Self hate,I have just started college and I feel worthless everybody in my college is good at studies or extra curricular activities and I'm good at studies but I don't know anymore cause everybody is pretty studious and I don't have any talent and now i feel like i'm not good at anything and I have a friend who is in the same college she is getting selected in societies and when ever she calls me and tells me about her achievements I feel so useless and worthless and I don't know what to do anymore and whenever I try to talk to someone they say it's a phase.I really need some help my self hate is getting to me.please help me out.
1397,Is it messed up a lot of my self hate has gone away after I finally got away from a toxic ex?,Like I have lost a lot of my self hatred because I figure as long as I’m not as bad of a person as they were to me. I’m doing pretty damn good. Is that a completely fucked way to think?
1398,Can going through a mental illness make you an improved version of yourself?,...
1399,Scared of confrontation,"I’ve been invalidated many times before by my ex but in general, I hate confronting people with just about everything. I tend to be passive aggressive when I text because I don’t want to sound bitchy or really straight forward. Just now I sent a text to my friend speaking the truth and being as straight forward as I could. I’m scared as to how she’s going to react and I’m really really nervous that she’s not going to like what I had to say.

How do I get rid of this anxious feeling towards confrontation?"
1400,First session with a councillor (not therapist) and they encouraged me to research anti psychiatry (anti vaxx of mental health),"I contacted a charity for councilling with regards to some childhood abuse, had the first session today which was predominantly them talking, and the Councillor was at one point talking about Anti psychiatry - as in, a belief that severe mental health issues (Bipolar/Schizophrenia etc) don't actually need medication/treatment, and that it's all just a big ploy by medicinal &amp; health care companies to keep people addicted to drugs or in therapy that doesn't work so they don't get better, and that even in the UK NHS doctors/psychiatists/therapist are profiting off these. Frankly it came off as some serious tin foil conspiracy delusions and I'm more than a little concerned. Basically, anti psychiatry is the anti vaxx of mental health and I'm alarmed that they even brought that up as something I might be interested in and should research especially considering I have severe mental health issues.

Would you continue if someone was talking about that? I don't really want too. I'm really put off because I feel like encouraging me to research that nonsense, knowing I'm mentally vulnerable and in a very bad place, is really gross and actually could be really detrimental to someone's mental health.

I also got a message shortly after from them saying we should talk over WhatsApp? In addition to zoom. I feel pretty uncomfortable with it if I'm honest."
1401,Hey All. Looking for Suggestions on what everyone is doing during Covid,"I have a few mental Health Issues. I have always had High Functioning Anxiety, but about 6 years ago I was diagnosed with West Nile. Was pretty sick, but one of the issues that appeared due to West Nile was Brain Lesions. This messed with me and I developed a few more Mental Health Issues aka Bipolar Disorder. 

I live in Oregon and have not been able to do in-person counseling.  The telecounseling is not working out for me. I am a Network Engineer and spend all day on computers and it is to the point that I have an extremely hard time wanting to spend more time on a computer and I have a hard time Associating people on the other side with a real person. It makes for a very poor experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

What have you all been doing during these times? Anti-Depressants and my Meds are ok, but I benefit the most from in-person counseling.  I am having an extremely hard time and having constant breakdowns."
1402,Is it wrong or selfish to want someone to care about me?,"Recently I ended a bad friendship with someone who told me they didn’t have the time or energy to help me anymore. They said they needed and liked to be alone. 

I don’t really have any close friends currently, the few people I would talk to constantly have either cut contact with me or don’t talk to me as much. Which I guess is fine, but I really, really miss having friends that cared about me. Everyone who has left me has said the same thing: they were alone during the best times of their lives and didn’t need me to be their friend anymore. I’ve always been an introvert and hated socializing with people who weren’t my closest friends, but I don’t understand this at all. Do people not want friends? Is this a normal thing? 

I’m really shy and introverted so it’s hard for me to make friends in the first place, so it hurts when they don’t talk to me. I feel like no one even cares about my existence. And i know I can’t make people like me or talk to me or help me, they aren’t obligated to. But I WANT someone to care about me and I want them to want to be friends with me. And my past friendships have kind of taught me that it’s wrong to want someone to help you. I feel like I can’t talk to people about my struggles because I’m a burden and it’ll drain them and ruin our friendship. I feel so alone right now and I’m really confused. 

I’ve always tried to hold as much empathy for other people as possible, tried to care so much, but all this has done is make me clingy and codependent. And no one cares for me. And I can’t blame them because everyone only has to look out for themselves. 

Is it wrong to want friends to help me? Is it wrong to care about other people so much? I know I’m an introvert but I would never want to be completely isolated. I just feel really selfish because I shouldn’t burden anyone"
1403,Coping with a friend who won't get help,"TW: eating disorders and suicide attempts 
A friend of mine who has a severe eating disorder won't accept help. About 5 months ago he attempted suicide once finding out he was going to be admitted to an eating disorder center in another state (we don't have any in-patient ones in the state) and after the attempt he stayed there for about three months and was sent home. I recently found out that he lied his way out of the center by faking getting better and since being home has lost even more weight. In conversations with his parents they've said he is close to dying. He absolutely refuses help and is a constant danger to himself and others. He throws up on the floor of the therapists office when he doesn't like what they're saying, he drives recklessly even when other people are in the car, he brings people back into his life he knows are bad for him and threatens suicide if they leave, which realistically they will. Last night after his doctors and parents told him he might have to go back to the center he threatened suicide and then didn't answer so we had to call 911 because it was late and we couldn't get ahold of his family. We're all still in high school and we all also have our own mental health issues we're are severe for most of us and i'm worried about other friends in the group and their safety with dealing with this. His mom answered me this morning and pretty much said he's moments away from his heart stopping and they don't know what to do anymore besides send him back which we obviously agreed with. I just don't know how to cope when he won't accept the help and i'm worried about the safety and mental health of the other people around the situation when we all feel so helpless. Any advice on how to help or how to cope with the situation?"
1404,Paranoia is ruining my life,"Hello, I am currently in the process of making an appointment with a therapist, but I wanted to run my problem past a few people as well. I've dealt with anxiety and depression for many years, but in the past year the depression has subsided and the anxiety has skyrocketed to a point of extreme paranoia. To a point where I will sit for hours and think of ways my friends, ex-friends, family, or anybody could try and backstab me any way they could. Not only with people but I feel as though I can't even trust technology. For example, I fear my house will burn down if I don't leave everything perfectly. I fear after I sent a text or email I have to check it multiple times throughout the day to make sure I said what I thought I said. I know these thoughts are irrational. What do you think could be going on? I'm in a constant state of worry and anxiety."
1405,bored but no motivation to do anything,"i’m 16f, in college and i just don’t have the motivation to do anything man

i tend to get distracted easily nowadays and online learning really is not the best, especially when it’s just worksheet after worksheet

fuck man i don’t even have the motivation to play video games anymore, i haven’t showered in weeks and my room is an absolute dumpster. and as much as i try to coerce myself into cleaning it, i just,,, cant bring myself to do it. i also cant fall asleep easily anymore which makes it so it’s even harder to concentrate during the day.

i’m so utterly bored but at the same time i cant find the motivation to actually do anything. 

anyone else have a similar problem, or can offer some advice for me? anything at all would be better than nothing considering i have nothing to lose"
1406,Feeling down and like it won’t get better,"Hi all,
     When I was little I used to believe depression wasn’t real. In eighth grade I became a little depressed, and cut myself before my parents found out and told me that it’s not normal to be doing this (obviously). They made me feel like an idiot and that my feelings were insignificant. I’m a sophomore in high school right now and I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom but I feel ashamed to say that I feel really depressed right now. I also feel like I’m making this all up and that my “depression” is inconsequential compared to others’ traumatic experiences. I really feel down in the dumps right now and it’s all been building up over the years. I’ve never opened up this much to anybody before as what is written down below.
     A couple months ago, I started doing marijuana and vaping with my friends. I felt like a normal person for the first time in my life, since my parents are Russian in America, Republican in a Democrat state, very religious, and sexually + drugwise abstinent. Sometimes I wonder how they have any fun at all; their lives seem incredibly dull. Either way, back in mid December they found some weed and vapes in my room. They were furious; and rightly so. They grounded me indefinitely, took all of my devices away (it was winter break) and said they would meticulously look through my phone. Now I need to mention that I had one vape still left hidden somewhere, although j abstained from it for two weeks because my parents drug tested me every week and didn’t allow me to go out of the house at all. I’m a very social person, and I begin to get very depressed without anyone to talk to. I feel so different from the rest of my family, who bring up how bad marijuana is every day, even though it’s legal in California. They started treating me like I was a completely different person. Every day I had nothing to do, I started being unable to fall asleep before 4 am, and I felt so unbearably alone and different from my parents and even my older sister, who was usually chill with me. After three weeks, I got my devices back because school had just started after one last test. A couple days later, I decided there was no reason to keep the vape anymore, so i took one last hit to make peace with it and I threw it away. It honestly didn’t feel good, and I felt so guilty and feared they would test me again. They did. They told me I wouldn’t be able to go outside, much less hang out with friends, for a month. It killed me. For the first time in three years I started cutting myself again and I feel at rock bottom. I can’t concentrate on my classes at all anymore. When I was on cannabis, I could relatively easily do all my schoolwork but now school is incredjbly difficult and I feel like I’m not smart enough. I fear I’m going to be a homeless person on the streets in ten years, or much worse, a drug addict. I was never addicted to marijuana, and could (with a bit of difficulty) pass up nicotine for a while. At this point I’m just venting because I don’t have anybody to talk to about this and I feel that even my best friends wouldn’t understand, especially me being a male. Worst of all, the weather in my area is awful and feels like my emotions right now. I feel like all of what I wrote is just me blabbering about how my life sucks when it probably doesn’t.
     I have absolutely no privacy in my parents’ house. I was never allowed to stay outside after sundown, I had to work for and buy my own phone, yet my parents take it away and act like it’s theirs. They’re incredibly frugal and it’s difficult to convince my mom to get new clothes and she more than once told me that since I wanted a shoe collection, I must be gay. And that vans shoes are stupid and a waste of money, even though I skate. Speaking of which, I can’t even do that anymore. It was one of my favorite pastimes next to programming. I plan to major in computer science, and I’m arguably pretty good at programming although often I feel like I’m not good enough and won’t be able to maintain a job. I have so many insecurities I’ve never told anyone that keep me up at night sometimes. 
     I want to be unique in so many ways, but my parents crush me whenever I say something about myself. For example, I said that skate surfing (latching onto a friend’s car with a rope on a skateboard) would be fun to try; they looked at me like I was insane and I fell quiet before I tainted our relationship further. Speaking of which, they wont let me even get a permit to learn how to drive, saying I’m irresponsible and that she doesn’t want to pay insurance. Maybe they have a point, but I’m a straight A student who takes AP classes, doesn’t cuss at home, etc. even before they found out I had tried marijuana, they enforced every aspect of my life. They sent me off to a private Catholic school instead of the public school which, after realizing I didn’t fit in with anyone from my school (rich kids, smart kids, popular kids), I begged to transfer back to the place where I knew people and had strong friendships. She had promised me after one night of me complaining that if, by the end of freshman year, I still wanted to transfer, they would do so. Guess what? They didn’t. I begged and begged because every day at school was so dull without my friends despite my efforts to acclimate. They even told my counselor (who is the one teacher/staff member whom I genuinely dislike) and had a LONG talk with our pastor. It felt humiliating; I never even chose to be Christian and I feel more atheist and there are so many thing I disagree with. 
     This is just such a huge rant, and I’m really sorry. My parents are just so toxic sometimes, for example, they’re very homophobic yet say they would still love me if I was gay. I’m straight but I really hate people who bully people because of their sexual orientation; if they keep it lowkey I don’t care but my dad once heard an lgbt ad on the radio and said that “those idiots need to shut up” it just left a sour taste in my
mouth. 
     What I’m trying to say is my parents try to make me someone I am most definitely not, and oppose anything unorthodox at all. I’m a very open person and often it’s unbearable to live with them sometimes even though I’m not physically or (usually) verbally abused. I dream of moving out and college is a beacon of hope, and yet I’m furious at my parents for making me different and not letting me be myself.
     If you have any thoughts, comments, advice, anything, please comment down below. I really need someone’s opinion. I’ve tried to be as impartial as possible throughout this practically essay length post. I’m just feeling rock-bottom right now and I have no idea what my future holds, nor anyone i feel comfortable talking about it to."
1407,Is it wrong or selfish to want to be loved?,"People always say “no one owes you anything”, “no one is obligated to talk to you”, “you need to love yourself”, “spend time alone, you’ll enjoy your own company” and things like that. 

If this is all true, is it wrong or selfish to want someone to love and care about me? I’m an introvert and I enjoy being alone but I want to feel loved by someone, like I’m needed and someone cares that I exist. Some of my friends have left me saying they were isolated at the best times of their lives. I can’t relate because I want to feel appreciated, but according to society I can’t expect anyone to care for me. Right now I feel so alone, anxious, and depressed. I can’t love myself. I just want someone to be there for me and listen to me. But I feel selfish because no one owes me this. And I feel like a burden telling anyone about my struggles because they aren’t obligated to care. None of my friends talk to me anymore and i can’t expect them to. I don’t want to be all alone like them, I just want to be loved. Is this wrong?"
1408,Do I tell my FP that I have BPD if our friendship is slipping through and I want to save it?,"I have BPD, and this is the first FP friendship I’m having where I know I have BPD…if that makes sense. Like before this all of my friendships where I’ve idolized people I didn’t know I had BPD, but now I do.

Do I tell this person? Our friendship is good but is a little on the rocky road right now, and they may know. They’ve helped a lot with my anxiety/depression and being like “yo you need help” and being the first person who’s been there for me, showing patience and time for me.  I want to be fair and tell them why I have been dependent/too reliant on them, may have been unfair to them etc etc.

They may already know, but is this something I should bring up? As like a courtesy thing? And if so how does one go about doing that?

Is this a good idea do you think? I don't think they'd be the type of person to then hate me for it, I would guess they would be like thanks for telling me, but also I have BPD, so I could just be assuming all of this"
1409,How do you motivate yourself to do things when depressed?,"Some background: I’ve had depression for some time now and usually I could function just fine, with some trouble here and there with hygiene and fulfilling my responsibilities but never anything serious until now. 

Over the summer I started taking anti depressants for the first time ever and they made me so happy I didn’t realize I had gained ~30 pounds. I’m currently considered medically obese based on my height (5’8”) and weight (205 lbs.) I’ve been overweight since I was 6 years old so my weight is a sensitive issue for me. 

I usually enjoy weightlifting and running but since that time over the summer I’ve gotten a rlly bad psychiatrist (who I’ve since dropped) who prescribed me meds that have made everything he worst it’s ever been. 

So my real issue: I’ve been losing weight through calorie counting (a few pounds a month) but I’d preferably like to workout regularly to work on my physical fitness as that means more to me than the number on the scale. The issue is that it genuinely feels like I cannot do it. I just can’t force myself to exercise. I have never felt this way before, in my entire life. It’s like I’m a marionette puppet and somebody else is controlling the strings. Has anybody else felt this and been able to combat it?"
1410,Is my friend sadistic?,"TW. What if she has some bad personality disorder?


I asked her if she was sadistic because I recalled when she was upset she said sometimes she wanted to rape one person who betrayed her and murder one person who betrayed her. 

She said ‘no’ and ‘she just has anger issues’. Thing is she seems like one of the most innocent adult girls I know. I realize now she could’ve just said no so I wouldn’t be upset?"
1411,I think I'm always lying to myself,"It's always this thing. I'm always hung up about my failure to socialize with my peer group. It's not lile I'm in school anymore. I'm in my early 20s and I have a job where I work with a lot of colleagues. It's not always direct contact, but we see each other almost every day and I always worry that if they gossip between themselves, it's about me. Or if I have to work with someone for the first time, I always worry if they find me weird. If I'm perhaps too intense, or maybe I work way too hard and I'm too stiff and just can't losen up. Maybe I look like I have a stick up my butt. But anyways, it bothers me a lot, even though it may not seem that way. 

I worry if I've said ""thank you"", and perhaps I forgot to say it and then they'll find me rude. I just don't fit into any group and it's really weighing on me, because every negative thought comes crawling out of the woodwork and I just hate myself. I hate this. I hate this so much. 

I always end up lying to myself, thinking it's fine. I should learn to not care, but I freaking hell do. I care and I can't do anything about it. At the end of the day it really bugs the hell out of me."
1412,Oh boy Oh boy,"I have no idea how many posts I have made on different pages regarding asking for help and support. I met some great people along the way those helped me beyond words but I still wonder for how long will this go on? 
I don't family support neither I can afford a therapist. 
I feel as if I am just dancing on this thin rope of hope that one day everything will be better and that day may never come.
Why the hell is my mental health the way it is? Why me? Why can't I just have a normal life? A day without worrying , stress , compulsions and what not.
I am exhausted."
1413,Needing some advice about therapist insisting I get on antidepressants,"So I posted this to another sub as well but I’m really desperate for advice and stressing over this. This is kind of a long explanation but I wanted to provide context: 

So I (F20) have been dealing with stress from lockdown, getting sober from a really bad alcohol problem, and a breakup so I decided to go back to therapy. I’ve had mental health issues since I was 8 and it runs in my family. I tried committing suicide a few times in my teens and had some intense traumatic experiences. I’m not suicidal anymore and I’m definitely way more stable than when I was a teen. I tried around 10 different antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs) and anti anxiety meds throughout high school and either felt no effect or negative effects from them. I did follow the guidelines with all the meds I was put on and took them for a few months to try and get the desired effect. 

I had a horrific experience with Effexor when I was 16 where my psychiatrist refused to take me off it even though I was having horrible side effects. I had very intense physical pain (racing heart, constricted chest) and anger when I missed a dose. Since I was forced to be on it and no one would help me get off it, I decided I’d take out the time release capsule in it to try and taper off gradually. That didn’t work. Eventually I tried to commit suicide because the side effects were torturous and the withdrawal even worse. I went to a hospital and they put me on wellbutrin and helped me get off Effexor.

I relayed all this information to the therapist and she said I need to try meds again and I probably just wasn’t taking the right ones. Our first session was yesterday and it felt hard to get a word in edgewise for a lot of it because she kept trying to give me all these psychiatrist’s contact information and interrupting me to insist I need meds. For example, after talking for a few minutes, she says “so I take it depressions your main issue?”. I said “well depressions definitely a part of it, but my OCD is equally bad or worse”. I can barely even finish the sentence before she says “well OCD is just a part of anxiety, and anxiety is something we will fix with meds after we get you a psychiatrist.” She was also saying I definitely need to be on medication because I started having mental health issues at such a young age. 

Is this normal? It made me feel uncomfortable. I kept trying to say that I don’t want to try meds again and she kept shooting it down. It’s obvious she won’t work with me if i’m not on them. I don’t understand why she can’t at least just do a month or two working with me and teaching me coping skills for my obsessive thoughts (she has training in CBT) but she doesn’t seem to think that’s acceptable. I mentioned I have sleep issues to my GP and she also was extremely insistent I take an antidepressant which is incredibly similar to Effexor even though I told her the awful experience. She said “it’ll be different now, you’re older”. Why does it seem like every medical professional is unwilling to work with me without being on pills? I’m at the end of the rope because this therapist is the only one in my area who can take on new clients and is covered by my insurance. Should I just go on the drugs even though it scares me?"
1414,DAE feel nervous about consultations?,"I recently had my first ever diagnostic consultation and the whole time I was so scared that my feelings aren't valid. And when it was going on, the doctor kept asking me why why why why

Like why do you wake up sad, and I honestly don't know. And I felt scared of saying that I didn't know because I was scared she'd think I was faking everything. There was evem a part when I told her how my uncle's recent death pushed me farther into my sadness, but that when I was told he passed away I didn't feel anything. And she answered like, well you're not making sense. You said it made you sadder but now youre saying you didn't feel anything.

But is it really that complex? I said i didn't feel anything when i was told he was dead but when you send off a body, and when you actually see it, you can't help but be sad, so I'm nervoud I fucked up my diagnostic consultation. I was prescribed 20 mg of prozac and 50 mg of a sleeping pill then she wrote a request for me to do a bunch of laboratory tests which will for sure make a hole in my pocket especially now that I've left my job (something I told my doctor). A lot of the tests are like urinalysis and blood tests, another is a thyroid test, a bun test and something to test my creatinine and also my uric acid and a blood panel among many others. I don't really know why it's these tests though, but shluldn't I be taking mote cognitive tests? Or tests that aee geared towards personality? I'm just afraid that my doctor thinks I'm lying to her about these very real things I've had to go through."
1415,"How do I stop throwing stuff, screaming, and slamming doors when angry?","I know, this isn't normal nor healthy, so please don't write things like that, because I want to fix this issue without feeling bad about myself. 
I don't know why I become this angry. I throw things (the most expensive being a phone) and shout and slamming doors. Everytime after the anger ""cycle"" ends I feel terrible and feel like a bad human being. 
I guess it has a bit of back story because a lot of the people around me (I won't name any) and I've seen people throw things and slam doors since I was 5. They're all good people I guess but they suffer the same issues.
I've seen people say in the internet ""people don't change"" and ""you should not have children you'll be violent"" and even heard that people who throw stuff ""never change and always terrible people"" but I never really intended to get that angry, nor hurt anyone.
 I feel very bad about my self and question everytime ""why am I like this?"" I thought insulting myself over it wouldn't work, so I'm really hoping to see change.
I'm worried that I'll grow up with this habit, and people will avoid me. I don't know where to start from. Therapy is I believe, pricy, and it is a bit scary thinking about how it's shown in the movies and stuff, and I am too busy with schoolwork unfortunately. 
Is there anyway to deal on my own as a first try? I'll consider professional help if it won't work."
1416,"Depression feels like ""the upside down"" in stranger things","I just have come to the realization, that that's how I would describe it best. Anyone agree?"
1417,My chest hurts 24/7...,"Hi, I've had my share of anxiety attacks where I hyperventilate, tremble and puked almost everyday so i got rlly skinny for a year or 2 until i met my partner (first and last) then i got much better. I didn't get myself diagnosed or visit a doctor at all because part of myself didnt want to.

Meeting my partner definitely lit up my world and I've been eating very well. I do get anxious and tremble a lot when im nervous, it's like ive lost control of my nerves just like during the years of consistent attacks. But i dont hyperventilate or puke now. Even tho deep down, i do feel like puking. 

About roughly 2 months ago, i started experiencing intense chest pain and it's stuck with me till now. It intensifies mostly at night (right now) or when i find myself filled with anxiety, uncertainty and frustration. Basically when i feel cornered and stressed out. It's affecting my life so much because when it hurts the most, i will cry, feeling suffocated which then makes me feel like im slowly dying or having a heart attack. I cant say for sure this feels like a panic attack cos IT DOESNT END.

I confess that deep down, I'd like to relapse and get skinnier again like before... I came here to see if there's any advise i can heed. It's 4am and i cant sleep cos it hurts too much..."
1418,Is this an eating disorder or is the food bad?,"So I’m not quite sure what this is but I very rarely eat until I’m full nowadays. I used to eat a lot of food but since I was tall I never really got fat. However at some point my mum stopped cooking breakfast and lunch for me and I don’t know how to cook much and when I try the ingredients I want to use are mostly gone. That being the case I usually have one meal a day (that being dinner) and whatever I can pick up from the cupboards (crisps, biscuits, a sandwich if the stuff is there etc) so you’d expect I would be hungry but whenever I eat a meal I struggle to finish the whole thing and usually eat 45-75% of the meal depending on what it is. After eating a certain amount of food however the food starts to taste worse and worse until It becomes what I can only describe as boring or bland, sometimes it just tastes watered down. I’m wondering if my mum is bad at cooking or this is some sort of disorder, or maybe I just don’t like what she’s cooking?"
1419,Someone said to me -,"“ The mind is a dangerous place” 

Omg I felt that, it hit me so hard I was almost crying, it’s so true."
1420,Such intense anxiety,"For 3 weeks now I've been experiencing crippling anxiety. It mixed with this constant feeling of derealization. I can't afford therapy, and i need to work to survive, but it shows no sign of improvement. I just want a little peace of mind. I feel so awful. Last night I thought about the relief suicide would be, i could never do it, but the thought was so relaxing. I need anything, something to feel ok again."
1421,Does my brother have ODD? (Oppositional defiant disorder),"I think my big brother has ODD. How can I get him help?

My brother and I both have ADHD-Inattentive form. I am diagnosed, he isn’t, in fact I don’t think he believes he has ADHD, which is probably down to his superb coping mechanisms. He is extremely knowledgeable, smart and driven. I’m 25 he’s 30. For the past year I have come to realise that he is not who he purports to be. I think this is because he believes that I always have to see him in a good light so that “I always have a good role model to look up to” - a stance he has maintained since we were kids. Which wasn’t a difficult for him to maintain as we lived in different cities at the time. Anyway, the reason that I know that he is not himself with me, a couple of years ago I found out that he uses our sister and mother as his emotional punching bag. I wouldn’t go into details as this is already a super long post, but he has definitely caused them both serious trauma and they both didn’t tell me as they didn’t want to trouble me. He is also fond of randomly insulting our parents’ intelligence behind their backs and to my face, I think he knows I hate it when he does that and gets pleasure from it, he likes to pick on your insecurities and wave it in your face(I’m not sure he could truly just have been venting). He is also extremely manipulative, and controlling. He used to get quite physical with my siblings and I when we were younger and has beaten me up a few times in the past. Now this has morphed into loosing his temper, gaslighting, manipulation and being vindictive. As hard as it might sound now, he is in fact a good guy. He shows empathy at times and even when he looses his shit, shows regret afterwards (I know that sounds like battered wife syndrome but picture someone running over a kid’s sandcastle on the beach by accident, that look of regret, is what he’ll have on his face). My family and I are now at a point where I am tired of tiptoeing around him and I feel that our fear of “causing” him to get angry only prevents him from getting the help he needs. In that regard, we’re part of the problem. Additionally, he thinks he is ALWAYS in the right, which makes suggesting he seek help extremely difficult. 
Does anything I’ve said sound like he might have ODD? And if it does how could I find a way to get him to seek help?"
1422,Breaking up with a therapist and good therapists in Upstate NY(Essex County),"&gt;Breaking up With My therapist

I (19NB) wanna break up with my therapist but I'm unsure how to do it. The reason is that she's not listening to me at all and just ignoring what I'm saying to push HER decisions based on HER experiences onto me. She's a great therapist but her skillset is not one that is required for someone like me.

How do I go about telling her this? I have a meeting on Friday and that's already planned since last week, before I realized how she's not the one for me. (I'm autistic and incapable of recognizing my emotions most of the time)

&gt;Therapists in Essex County, NY (Id rather not share my town for obvious reasons)

Any good therapists skilled in handling LGBTQ+ patients with PTSD, Autism, and Lack of Emotions? Obviously trial runs are good but just thought I'd ask"
1423,"how do I convince myself to tell my therapist about some of my worse, ""weirder"", ""scarier"" problems?","so my last post got into more detail about the specific issues im dealing with, but last night i had a session with my therapist and i didn't know how to bring up the issue. does anyone have any tips/tricks? :)"
1424,Self confidence,"So I’ll start with the basics, I’m 16, living in the uk, and if I’m honest I’m struggling with self confidence, anxiety and the list goes on.

I worry way to much about myself in a way that I’m starting to hate myself and the way I look, I’m to scared to do anything about it. Like if I could describe how bad I feel it’s like -100/10.

I’m always scared of what others think of me and hate being taken the piss out off, I’m always nervous of losing someone or people talking about me.

I also have in general really bad hygiene and I have a feeling this has something to do with it, like I can not be bothered to clean my room, brush my teeth or shower half the time and it’s clearly embarrassing but I’m not motivated enough to sort it out.

As well as my list I have, I had broken up with my ex a year ago and have been feeling lonely like super lonely ever since and I think about here everyday.

I’m scared to talk to someone about it all and this is because like I was grown up with a get on with it attitude and kept all my problems to myself and never seeked advice from anyone and when I did never felt like I got the advice I wanted. I read online about how it could be depression or something but I feel like you can never trust the internet

Any help would be really really appreciated in a time like this as well, thank you for reading"
1425,feeling anxious all the time,"i'd say i've always been a worrier, for as long as i can remember i've felt anxious about insignificant things and always just felt nervous for no real reason. but lately, in the past 6-8 months or so I've found it really hard to cope. At first it was stress from school, I was very worried about exams. in the last few months my school stress has gotten a bit better, but now I'm finding it really difficult to get out of the house. my country is in lockdown so I'm now at home most of the time, but we're still allowed to go out to exercise. I tried to go out for a walk the other day to get some fresh air but I couldn't enjoy it because I was panicking the whole time. I was always checking behind me to make sure nobody was following me or anything and I just felt anxious the whole time. A girl shouted something about the way I was dressed from across the street and even though I knew she wasn't going to come near me or anything my heart started racing and i felt so nervous and unsafe. This happens every time I try to go out alone. I feel paranoid and scared that something bad is going to happen to me. I needed to go to the store to get a few things today and I had to beg and plead my brother to come with me because I was just too nervous to go on my own. I'm just tired of feeling scared and anxious all the time. If it's not school I'm worrying about, it's something else. I'm just always nervous and on edge about something. I'm not diagnosed with anxiety or any type of mental health condition and I'm not really in a position where I can speak to a doctor to get a diagnosis. I've tried to speak to my parents about it but they just told me to get over it. I just want to know what's wrong with me and what I can do to stop feeling like this."
1426,"i get these 15 min periods every other where i think that everybody around me never actually meant what they said and i just start tearing up, am i ok?","edit for title: every other day


hey guys, so as the title says this happens every few days for about 15 mins it started about a month ago and when this happens i get super jealous and angry and sad (no i have never thought of ending my own life) and i just sit on my bed and think about how nobody actually loves me and everything anybody has ever said was fake and that everybody doesnt like me

i am fine now, im really happy infact because i was talking with my gf and talking to her really makes it better

for reffernce im 14 male ive never had a mental illness (exept for ADHD if you concider that one)  and mentall illness runs on my dads side of the family

am i ok? im not sure but if it gets worse ill talk to my mom because she works in a mental facility"
1427,My Demons are winning today,Today is not one of my better days my depression and anxiety are attempting to convince me I am worthless.... I know better.....

1428,Homesick,"I just need a place to put this so it doesn't stay bottled up. I am currently at the lowest point in my life. I enlisted on the navy back in February. I left for boot camp in September and graduated In November. I'm currently at my school but just don't feel like I belong here. I don't have any real friends, and feel all the people I talk to just tolerate me. I want nothing more than to go home and see my family. I joined the military to have a place in the world but just feel like I'm not wanted. I don't want to be here anymore.I haven't told my family this as I don't want them to worry about me. Would anyone know a way to help cope with the homesickness? It's just messing me up so bad."
1429,"Close To Two Years Ago, I Was Fat And Depressed. Today, I Am Fit And Still Depressed.","Up until 3 years ago, when I was a junior in high school, I was in a great place. I was athletic, popular, and relatively happy. I moved alot, but I was adaptable and could always find a niche. This changed when a series of sports injures forced me into having a shoulder surgury, effectively ending my sports career. Shortly after, my family had to move once again, but without the almost instant companionship that is found on a sports team, I became remarkably isolated and rapidly gained weight. My self-esteem plummeted and my overall quality of life deminished. Once I graduated high school and left for college, I made the decision to change my lifestyle in the hopes of just feeling better as a whole. I deduced that the change in my physical appearance was the sourse of my depression, due to that when I was in shape I was happy, and once that changed I was not. I now find myself here, 2 years later, in much better shape and still just as isolated, unhappy, and unsatisfied with both myself and my life. I want to be normal, but I have no idea what to do next. I just want it to be better."
1430,I only feel/act funny when my mind is altered by sleep deprivation,"So I feel depressed like most of the time and I have social anxiety and ADD or ADHD, either one, and I don’t really have an actual sense of humor in my normal waking hours when I’m on a healthy sleep schedule at night. But when I’m all sleep deprived I can be hilarious. Even when I got like 12 or 13 hours of sleep, I was still sleep deprived just cause of constantly staying up for 24 hours and the night before I slept 12 hours I was up for like 37 hours. I was also diagnosed with schizophrenia but I don’t even have symptoms of schizophrenia unless I’m sleep deprived. So I think being depressed and numb clouds my sense of humor and hyperactivity. And I hate it cause it makes me boring and dull, and I never care that much even when having fun. Like when I watch my favorite movie or talk with friends I just have slight enjoyment and not enough happiness and satisfaction and I don’t care about it enough. This depressed and numb state of mind also makes me not care about world issues or government issues or injustice that decent human beings care about because I feel like I don’t care what happens to me or anyone because I feel so numb and apathetic. I also don’t have any passions or interests that get me fired up with happiness or enjoyment and when I’m interested in something, I can never properly talk about it in a complex manor and I can only say the most basic and simple thing about my interest like “that song is really good and I love it” and almost nothing else 😐 and even with my deeper interests that I’ve always had a passion or interest in, I don’t care enough to talk about it or do the activity or learn more or anything. I hate it. I feel slightly interested in everything on the internet, that’s why I click on videos that look kinda interesting but they’re only slightly interesting and while watching it, I feel no enjoyment or happiness and it literally feels like I’m in a hellish reality where I’m so numb and miserable that I can’t even be miserable because of feeling neutral and eh about everything. So I feel miserable about not being able to feel miserable. Which doesn’t even make sense but I hate not feeling enjoyment, pleasure, happiness, passion, excitement, and I miss having a really fun time. So it feels like hell even if I don’t have negative emotions necessarily. I feel slight stress and annoyance from my environment and situation but only very slight. Most of the time my brain is on numb non caring non enjoyment mode where I have no opinion on anything besides myself and my life. I honestly would rather feel emotional pain and misery than this cause at least when you hit rock bottom you can only get better if it can’t get worse. I feel like I’m stuck in a forever limbo of a fluctuating sleep schedule mess going from staying up 24 hours or more straight and having a normal sleep schedule to staying up all night again. I only feel happy and hopeful and funny when I’m sleep deprived. And I hate using sleep deprivation like a drug just because I don’t believe in prescribed or recreational drugs. I believe in natural fixes but getting into sleep deprivation over is definitely an unhealthy coping mechanism that I use to alter my mind and I wanna feel funny and validated without using an unhealthy coping method"
1431,I feel like I’m not made for this world.,"I’m a 19 yo male. And I have so many issues that I don’t even know where to start. I grew up socially isolated, and I’ve been through lots of emotional abuse, and some sexual abuse. And I’ve also done horrible things that I really still really hate myself for. 

Now, I’m dealing with really bad anxiety. I’m unable to communicate, or connect with people. I’m extremely slow and dumb. And, I’m literally unable to make friends. 

And on top of this, I can’t handle the responsibilities of life. Work life, Worrying about money, taking care of my health. I can’t handle all of it. 

I feel like I’m an alien trying to function in a world that just isn’t made for me. And now I’ve been having suicidal thoughts because of this. I just feel so done with everything. 

And I know I need therapy, but I don’t even know how I’ll approach that. 

For one, I don’t even know what type of therapy I need, because of all the issues I have. 

And for two, My options are limited. I live far away from town, and nobody is doing face to face therapy visits because of covid. Plus, I live with no internet access, so video visits are out of question. Technically I could use my phone data, but my connection buffers, and I could barely make phone calls. Plus, I don’t want my family eavesdropping or overhearing my personal problems.

So I don’t know what to do anymore. Everything feels hopeless."
1432,I’m 14 so maybe I’m just being over dramatic...,"I think the issue is that I have a feeling of dread which just comes over me at random moments and I try really hard to do things which make me happier. I play instruments, watch YouTube, get some homework done( if I’m that desperate) play games, exercise, listen to music or literally anything else which usually makes me happy

But idk why but there are periods where atleast once a week it just doesn’t work. All I feel for the whole day is just a dread which I cannot escape from and all I want to do is just crawl up into a ball and sometimes cry.

I don’t get it. Nothing in my life is terrible. I haven’t faced any trauma or anything like that. So I don’t get why I can’t be happy in those moments. They have been getting worse over the course of 2020 and today is the first time it has happened since 2021

Maybe it’s nothing idk but the only thing I think about and feel when it happens is the dread, the unhappiness and the sadness. 

I haven’t noticed any triggers for this to happen, it just happens. I haven’t talked to anyone about it and this is the first time I have talked about it ever. I just want to know if this is something or it’s just something which happens to everyone. 

I just want help"

1435,I need to give some tough love to my friend because he's not doing well and we can't baby him anymore. Please help.,"My friend struggles with his mental health a lot latelly. He most likelly has BPD and is a narssissit but he's not diagnosed because he refuses to go to therapy (he's a student so he's entilted to free therapy  funded by school).


He was always really toxic but I don't think he's a bad guy, he's just struggling with his mental health. He was disrespecting our rules and bounderies and his apologies always looked like this: ""I'm sorry but..."" but when we have honest talks with eachother he's always talking about how he regrets doing what he did in general.


Latelly his mental state got worse because he ended the relationship with his friends with benefits. They were really abusive towards eachother and he knew that so he decided to end it for her sake. 


Now all the abuse is directed at us, his friends. He's causing fights to demand an apology, he seeks validation of our care for him but it's never enough for him, he wants to commit suicide and always says ""if I had friends who'd care about me I wouldn't have to do that"" and he's also overdosing drugs. 


At first I tried telling him that we do care and was begging him not to harm himself but I quickly realised what he's doing. We have the same personality, our happiness depends on other people and when we're isolated from them even for a littlebit we get depressed. When I was younger I was seeking validation too but never got one, that taught me to be more independent and even though his case is way worse I think he should learn this lesson too so I distanced myself from him. It helped me a lot too because conversations with him were really draining me emotionally. Now whenever he starts to talk about suicide I tell him ""no, don't do that, we care about you"" and ignore him instead of pressing the issue and write long ""letters"" to him. I don't think he really wants to kill himself, it's just his cry for help but it's always a possibility so I do feel terrible every time I ignore him. I'm doing fine though, I won't let it ruin my mental stability I worked so much for.


But it's not working at all, he needs therapy. 


I think about writing him a long message, telling him that we do care about him but validating it constantly won't help him at all and that he needs therapy. I won't mention the drug issue because it's just a symptom caused by his mental state. 


Is that a good idea? What should I point out in this message? I know it might not work at all but as long as it won't make things worse I think I should do that. Me and our other friends are also wondering if we should tell his parents about this."
1436,Strange effects from (what I believe was) dissociation?," Hi, I was 16 years old when I experienced this particular 'episode' of dissociation, derealisation to be specific, for nearly 3 weeks (about 1.5 years ago). Now I'm not sure if this was linked to the dissociation, but I was unable to write or talk well during the time I experienced this. I was unable to think most of the time (or at least, hear or control my thoughts). When people around me tried to hold a conversation with me, I was not able to respond, think of a sentence or even fully understand what they were saying. I could only understand a few words at a time - most of the time, sentences sounded so meaningless and 'empty'. It sounded like they weren't talking to me.

I often struggle with anxiety, but even at this point I rarely felt anxious. I am pretty fucking scared of spiders and bees/wasps, but during this 'episode', seeing a spider crawl on my bed caused no reaction for me whatsoever. Absolutely nothing; I felt so so numb from everything, it was freaking me out but I couldn't feel anything so I wasn't able to express my confusion at all. Sitting in my room and staring at the wall, I couldn't hear anything in my mind, I still couldn't hear my thoughts. Colour and noises were quieter and bland. Everything seemed more greyish and 'out of tune'.

I'm very confused... I saw symptoms of dissociation but none included changes in weakened ability to write, understand language, speak and think.

Does anybody have answers whether dissociation could cause this? Or could this have been something else other than dissociation? "
1437,"Does it ever happen that right after you realise you have been happy for a few days, your mind brings on sadness?","Usually during a week i try to reduce the overall stress every day. Then after resting and doing all things I love, I realise I am happy or at the peak of happiness for the last lets say one week. The next day, the mind goes deep into anxiety, sleeplessness etc. Its like a saw tooth wave, happiness rises over a few days and then boom, drops like a rock in a few hours."
1438,Don't know how to move forward,"So long story short I've been through a really tough time with a very toxic friendship, there was heavy use of manipulation and guilt tactics, we've had no direct contact for a little while now but I'm still suffering a lot of mental scars, we share mutual friends and I used to get annoyed at seeing or hearing their name and I thought I was starting to move to a better place when their name no longer bothered me. Now it feels like I've taken a complete step back, everything about it frustrates me and causes me so much anxiety when their involved in online group activities, even if I don't take part, my partner does who also share the same mutual friends so I still get anxious by just knowing that person is there. I've not been able to confront or gain any closure because of the consequences it would cause for the group. I'm frustrated at feeling like it's under wraps and that I can't get my say on it. 
Anyway I just want to be able to move on and move forward without this anxiety and frustration dragging me down and I'm not sure how to do that, is there even a way where I can actively move on or is it just a matter of time and waiting for it to be processed and heal etc? If that's the case then I don't like not being able to be active in my own healing process, I hate having to be passive and it feels like I have no control over it or how long it takes"

1440,Imposter Syndrome Is Ruining My Passion And My Mental Health (19M),
1441,"""Perfectionism leads to rules and beliefs that create impossible expectations.""","Part I: My therapist just told me this (well, I'm paraphrasing). I'm sharing in case anyone else finds this helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

Part II: Does anyone have advice for how to overcome perfectionistic tendencies? They are, in part, what I blame for my lasting three weeks as a teacher. I have a hard time letting go of mistakes I made — the oddest little misstep from 10 years ago will pop into my brain at the most random times. I'm sure the other party never gives it a second thought, but I can't seem to stop."
1442,Obligation to see people through depression?,"I’ve been diagnosed with Bipolar II, Generalized Anxiety Disorder among a slew of other perks you get when you retire from the birth canal. Salary sucks and the perks aren’t great but I’m here. Enough of me trying to make the situation funny. Some days I don’t want to see people. Not my girlfriend, not my one parent because my other one is so sorry he’d rather play family with his girlfriend and ex girlfriends kids than me his only biological kid 🥳. Am I being dramatic if I tell my girlfriend that I don’t want to see anyone today? I want to be alone. I want to breathe, sit, sleep, eat and do what I want at my leisure without anyone else’s consent or thoughts about the matter. I’m 20. I deserve my own time. I don’t think I’m being selfish if I take alone time. Mind you all this is a rare occasion and I see my girlfriend DAILY. Everyday. Every day. All day. Everyday. All 7 of them. Even if we’re working she still comes when she gets off and stays until 4am. I go to her house and she cries if I try to leave before 3am. It makes me angry. I feel manipulated and I get aggressive when I’m manipulated or feel like someone is playing me. Thoughts about the matter."
1443,My psychiatrist gave me news today,"So I know I have OCD and Depression and I’ve been working on those to things to make it a little better but tonight I got some scary news and I need to talk about it. All my life I had paranoia ever since I was a little girl. I thought that my elementary put cameras on me and in my apartment to watch me. After I thought there was something always following me just watching. After I thought people were reading my mind and I believed that the government or something made these devices to read your mind and my friends would buy it to read mine. Then the vents, doors, and windows. I always have to keep the doors and windows closed and locked all day. When my family wanted to open windows for fresh air I didn’t care I would always close and lock them. I thought people were watching me in the vents. Now my psychiatrist said it could be my OCD mixed with critical depression but she also said there’s a chance it could be schizophrenia. Now I share a room with my mom and one night I woke up and saw someone I wasn’t half asleep. This person wasn’t a shadow in the door I could see their face features and they had clothes on and they told me to be quiet and then laid down next to my mom. I got up as fast as I could to check who it was but no one was there and I checked around the room. That could be because I was on a wrong medication that made me want to cut my fingers off. I’m scared I remember seeing these shadows when I was little all the time. Sometimes I hear this loud voice either calling my name or saying something else. I don’t know what to think. It’s big news to me and nobody is actually taking it seriously"
1444,I want to feel okay again,"There is quite a lot to unpack. 

I dont feel okay for too long and don't know how to keep going. It is over 10 years I often feel bad.

I always had this inner pressure in myself. I have a hard time to deal with stress, but somehow I managed to do an apprenticeship and a degree in engineering. 

But I always had the feeling I am the weird one. I always saw myself in the position of homeless people, because I felt this will be my future at some point.

In my freetime I am/was often by myself, often it was not really a problem. But it meant that I did not socialize a lot and ever only had the same friends for forever. Eventhough I wanted to participate in activities, jobs, events, I was too scarred to take part.

I was never really happy with myself and don't feel alive at all. I cant really show affection towards others, eventhough I wish. My humor is super cynical. For some times I went playing volleyball, but I just always felt weird around those people, but I knew I was the weird one. And this was the case in a lot of situations. I did my driver license, but only drove a few times afterwards, because I am too scared. I am scarred it would be too much and I am too stupid to drive. Even simple tasks around other people gives me the feeling a failure (cooking for example). I never planned vacation or meetings with friends a lot in advanced because you never know if that future exists for me. In vacations I never really could relax and always felt disappointed by it.

If I look back to those situations I am always shocked that I wasn't happy back then and why I did not live more. Why did I not do more stuff.

I never really persued something. I just lived. After my degree I started to work and had a really nice job, but I quit because I was feeling depressed. After that I was without a job for a few months, but in this time I just did nothing. Occasionally I drunk a little bit to much, too much time on my pc and watched too much pornography for some entertainment. I did not pay my bills, but I had money. I never reached out to someone. I never visited my friend eventhough he lived really close by. Sometimes scarred to go out of my house, felt like a monster on some days. I tried psychotherapy a few time but it just never felt right.

Now I am a similar point with my new job. Everything is too much for me. I cant handle big projects. I just want to quit, because I have no fun and just do minimal work and it is just a matter of time that I get fired. The last few days I did no eat well and slept bad.

It would be hard to find a job again after quiting, but maybe I need to do something completely else. An easy job, so I can take care of myself. I am ashamed that I have no passion &amp; knowledge for my field eventhough I studied so long. 

In a few days I will turn 29 and I am scarred my life is going downhill from here. I will never get a clear mind again. It is too late. I hate this world, because somehow it is against me, like a curse. But how can I complain, I never really tried. Never happened something that gives me hope to keep going. I sometimes wish I was physically ill, so I know that something is wrong with me.

At least I reached out to my family, a close friend (for the first time) and even have a doctor appointment."
1445,"I’m thinking it’ll end in suicide, prevention tips?","My boyfriend’s brother is 30, single, lives alone, drug addict. He has severe mental health issues to the point where he has threatened suicide multiple times, and will take random pills he finds everywhere to try and get a high. He’s been committed to the ER for psychoanalysis at least 3 times that I know of with no abnormalities, but we know he has severe depression. I believe my BF mentioned that he has a small degree of Downs or Asperger’s syndrome, but he can function like a normal person and you wouldn’t know it if you saw him. 

From what I’ve heard and seen, he is getting worse as he gets older. Now, I had a brother with the same exact issues, but he’s slightly younger and has mostly learned how to cope/deal/grew out of his mental health issues, so I’m at a loss with my BF’s brother and am starting to wonder if he will try committing suicide soon. 

Has anyone had experience with adults with such issues? If so, how did you help them? His family has tried therapy, medication, and various other forms of treatment, but now he’s gotten to the point where all he wants is everyone’s time and money and a free place to live because he’s so depressed, and no one has anything left to give/try. 

Anything helps, thanks."
1446,Absent Father Coming Back,"I am 17 Years of age and I recently had the confidence to finally ask for help in moving away from my abusive mother. 
My Mother and Father had been divorced ever since i was 4 and the only time i got to see my father was every two weeks for the weekend. 
We never had an emotional connection and he knew about my abusive mother’s action because i would come crying or the time i had a huge gash in my head where my stepmother found it while brushing my hair. 
Recently i came to him for help because i couldn’t handle the stress of my mother and school at the same time, i never showed up to school. 
The past couple years every time i would be picked up by my father he would ask to see my grades and which they weren’t bad considering i would never show up and i wasn’t failing. 
but a few month prior to moving in with him i lost all my motivation and need to keep going, i felt i was on verge of ending it all. 
I lost my myself for awhile and jeopardized my grades pretty badly. 
I didn’t want to move in with my father i was going to get a job and afford my own living conditions, but Covid has made things very difficult. 
I had no choice and moved with him anyways, i can tell he’s trying his best and trying to make up for time that he wasn’t there, today he scheduled a therapist appointment so he could “get us off on the right foot”. 
Which i appreciate and everything it’s just something i’m not used to, i’m not used to a stable household, someone caring about my feeling, or anything. 
but one thing that does bother me is that, he his constantly on me about school saying i should be passing and that’s his only “expectation”. 
Is it wrong for me to be offended or even hurt by that, i don’t feel he has the right to be putting expectations of me when he wasn’t there for me at all my whole life. 
Should i not feel that way because i live under his house, do i have a right to refuse or tell him how i feel?
Everything is very different for me, like i never ate with everyone at a dinner table, never had someone ask me what i wanted to eat, or what i needed for essential (clothes, shoes, etc.) 
But again is it wrong for me to be offended by someone having expectations of me even though they were absent and not helpful of my past situation?"
1447,I (27F) lost my dad 2 days ago and I am having a hard time processing it.,"Hello I just lost my dad unexpectedly 2 days ago. He's been in the hospital for the past month with sepsis but pulled through and got transferred to a rehabilitation facility. I was expecting a call Monday to discuss his treatment and to further put him in the direction of going home but instead got a call from my sister telling me he passed in his sleep. 

Im still in shock, I'm lethargic and just emotionally drained I can't cry anymore and I don't know what to do. I get 5 days off from work but I can't even process thinking of going back. 

Any advice? I've never lost someone so close to me and being my age it makes me feel so helpless. I was always super close to my dad."
1448,"I have a life changing opportunity, but it will break my mother’s heart . What do I do ?","
Well I wrote a post a while ago explaining what the problem is 


“I finally did it ! After years of verbal and emotional abuse I am going to look at my first home tomorrow!. I’m potentially moving into a mental health facility and I will hopefully have a little flat of my own . I know it’s a really small step because I’m only going for a viewing but I’m so excited 😄 it will be the first time I’ve left home in my life , fingers crossed I get it . I don’t wanna seem stuck up , but I’m kinda proud of myself for even viewing because this time last year I was so consumed by my manipulator I wouldn’t even see family and now I’m potentially moving out !. This time last year I was self harming to the point of near death and now Im viewing a freaking flat ! Sorry if that was over the top I just really hope I get it 😬”

I started the process and I should be moving in next week . The problem is that my mom is claiming I’m selfish and I’ve broken her heart . Earlier in the day she claimed that she would be finically broke without me , then she claimed I shouldn’t go because of my health (I have cf) even though she smokes in the house and has NEVER attended any hospital appointments with me . I don’t wanna break my mother’s heart , her whole family has abandoned her because of how bad she has treated me . She had a life to live and didn’t want me but now I’m moving on she says she loves me ? She’s been trying to kick me out for years (she claims I’m a liar , she never said that and I’m turning everyone against her ) and now I’m going she wants me ? 

 I love her with all my heart what do I do ?"

1451,I need help in accepting that what I am and what I do can be enough,"As I grew up I was constantly telling myself that I could do/be better in anything, always focusing on my errors and not being satisfied with my accomplishments. Now that I'm 19 it's started taking its toll, and I can never be happy about anything as I only see the negative sides of what I do. I'm seeing a psychologist (for other reasons) who asked me to try and be proud of myself even for the little good thing I achieve day by day, but I just can't do it. I can do it for everyone around me but non for myself. Does anyone have any advice for me?"

Some thoughts going through my head are: How did I lose a shirt? How can I be so careless? And then I proceed to tear apart my room and retrace my steps. 

I guess Im asking what are some tips to let go of this thought? How can I be ok with losing this, otherwise unimportant item? 

Does anyone else struggle with thoughts and things like this? Ive been having horrible scatter brains, running thoughts, and terrible memory lately."

1456,I am so afraid of gym class in my school,I am so afraid of the people in that class. They are all extremely athletic and I’m just a little less than average. I am extremely scared to change before gym class because I’m scared of the locker rooms. In that class I sometimes have to work in groups. Everyone there hates me because im not into gym like them. It’s getting to the point where I’m terrified to go to sleep at night because I know that when I wake up I will eventually have to go to gym class. I’m too scared to eat lunch at school anymore because of anxiety about gym. When I get home I barley eat anything because I’m so depressed about what happened in gym class. My mother tried to get the principal to switch my classes or something so I can just stop being so stressed. It of course didn’t work... thank you for taking time to read this.

My life just dramatically worsened, but it feels so weird. It doesn’t feel real. I’ve been having some derealization, depersonalization and existential anxiety, especially at night when I’m trying to sleep. I end up waking up extremely tired and unable to be productive to improve my grades and focus on gaining weight so I can be healthy.

I can’t have a proper conversation with my mom right now, every time I see her I feel like I’m going to burst into tears. The rest of my family is hard to talk to because it seems like the demand so much from me, they expect me to push through all this and get my life together. But I just feel like I can’t. I need to drastically improve my grades, gain a LOT of weight, go outside enough, move enough, stay in touch with my family and talk to them even if I don’t feel like it all while I‘m tired and dealing with all of this anxiety. I don’t know what to do. I just want things to go back to how they were, back to when I woke up with my mom smiling at me, when we laughed together and life was simple. Now everything is falling apart. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to see a doctor or therapist because I hate talking to adults, I just want a friend that is there for me and that understands my pain.

1459,How to tell toxic friend I want to move out?,"I think my (27 nonbinary) roommate of 5 years / friend of 15 years (26F) is struggling with undiagnosed BPD (borderline, not bipolar). Regardless of whether she truly has BPD, I've come to realize that the constant isolation, controlling behavior, manipulation, gaslighting, and overreactions to the most simple things are negatively impacting my life and mental health. For some background, I am 27, nonbinary, pansexual, and have been diagnosed with ADHD (inattentive), depression, and generalized anxiety. I am on medications and weekly therapy, and feel that I have made significant progress in my own self esteem and mental health in the past 2 years. My possibly BPD roommate (we'll call her A) is also in weekly therapy and takes medication for PMDD. Her mother struggles with BPD, and A is working through the PTSD associated with her emotionally abusive upbringing, repressed memories, and attachment issues. 

After many conversations with my therapist and describing the behaviors A exhibits at home and at work that are the main source of stress and unhappiness for me, my therapist believes that A may also have BPD, and has expressed that she's worried for my mental health and overall quality of life if I continue to cohabitate with A.

I've been friends with A for 15 years, and have lived with her +/- other roommates for the past 5 years. My therapist makes a point of stressing that A's feelings and reactions are not my responsibility, and that I should move out to protect my mental health, despite the negative feelings she would have towards me and the backlash that always comes with me doing something she doesn't like/want.

How do I tell A that I do not want to live with her anymore after the end of our lease in July? How do I deal with the fallout that will ensue when I tell her? It's really hard for me to walk the line of being considerate of her feelings and not being responsible for them at the same time. I want to tell her soon, and I know it will be terrible no matter what I say, but I want to make this transition as ""smooth"" as possible, for both our sakes. TIA."

Now I’m watching complete chaos ensue in the US and I am petrified! I feel like I want to have an escape-route off of this continent before shit goes south.

1463,"Leave of absence due to anxiety (Ontario, Canada)","My job is stressing me out. I've only been at the company for 1 year and 8 months (I was hoping to make it to 2 years) but my responsibilities have changed and I now dread each work day. (I'm also just shitty at my job and don't know what I'm doing). Since starting this job, I'm now experiencing anxiety regularly (only when I think about work) and had my first mild panic attack (during work hours). I used to be a high performer, but now I'm floundering. 

My options are:
1. Find a new job; or
2. Take a leave of absence
3. Something else?

Does anyone have experience with taking a leave of absence due to anxiety? Part of me feels like, if I could just take a 2 month leave of absence, I could transition the projects that are causing me the most stress, then go on leave, and when I returned, I'd most likely not have to take them back... But that feels like I'm cheating somehow. 

I also don't know if my family doctor would be willing to sign a note for a 2 month absence (I'm a new patient). 

For finding a new job, I'd likely take a pay cut of $20-30k (I make $90k and doubt I'll be able to find a job that pays the equivalent. I own my own house and live solo, so if I take this option, I'll have to work out a budget. It would suck to lose the money, but I'm not enthralled with my company... Honestly I'm ready to do it cause I'm just so tired of feeling shitty.

Maybe there's a 3rd option I'm not seeing."
1464,Feeling Invalidated,"This is my first time posting here, but I felt like this might be the best place to vent.
So I work in a nursing home where I'm taking care of dying Covid patients every single day, and in the back of my mind I'm constantly worried that I'll bring it home to my 2 year old. 
And my husband hasn't worked since March, so we're not doing very well financially. He was laid off right before the pandemic hit, so he didn't qualify for pandemic assistance, and he's been waiting to hear from unemployment for 10 months now. He stays home with our daughter while I work, but any time I'm home, she's 100% my responsibility so he can get a break. Which means I never get time to myself.

Today I told my husband that I'm feeling overwhelmed with work (Covid) stress, the state of the world where we're raising our daughter, not doing well financially, and all of that on top of already having anxiety and depression. I wasn't complaining, just trying to make my feelings known.
His response was ""you can't freak out. You're the calm one, and that keeps ME sane. So you need to stay calm for me so I don't freak out"".

And now I'm feeling very defeated and invalidated. I like being the rock in the relationship, and am happy to have that role in my family. But I feel like I took a pretty big step in directly saying how I feel instead of repressing and masking, and having it brushed aside and being told I can't feel how I do because it'll make HIM freak out made me retreat mentally again.

Well. Thank you for those of you who read my stupid little vent. I actually feel a lot better after writing down all of my feelings.
I hope everyone has a nice night."
1465,It's all too difficult.,"It's just so difficult to change your mindset. I made mistakes, I can justify the what and why and even define what I've learned to prevent it from happening again in the future. You would thing that would help calm me for more than 3 seconds, but my brain just has to flip the switch back to an anxious, catastrophic, downward spiral. 

My head feels cloudy and I'm just feeling really sad. Tired of talking about it and looking into self help. I want to be a red pill kind of gal, but I am definitely a blue pill kind of gal. I want an easy button, I want a quick fix because a life of trying and failing is so miserable."
1466,I don't like therapists.,"My mental health has gone downhill in the past few months. Panic attacks, depression, anxiety. All my life I've always been able to think about something else and snap out of bad times, but not this time.

I know I have to do something about it, but I can't bring myself to seek therapy. The thing is, I don't like therapists. They seem like condescending people. I'm not comfortable with the idea of opening up on front of someone so he can see how much of a failure I am. Not only that, but I don't want to dig deep in mind, I don't want to think about things that bother me. I just have this image of an obnoxious person writing down and judging me, I really don't want to go through that."
1467,I cannot stop emotional eating,Lately I’ve had some issues with my best friend to the point where I’ve cut them out of my life and that has caused me a lot of grief. Also things in my marriage haven’t been too great. Not horrible (well actually I don’t even know and have no one to really talk to about it. Even if things are bad I don’t feel strong enough to do anything about it anyway). I’ve never been one to turn to drugs and alcohol for coping but I’ve always used food to do so. It’s at the point now where if I don’t comfort eat every hour or two I’ll start to feel the anxiety creeping back in. And of course I’ve gained almost 20 pounds and my self esteem has taken a pretty big blow cause of that and all it’s done is make things worse. Vicious cycle and all. But I just can’t stop even though I consciously know I should. I’ve googled “how to stop emotional/stress eating” but I just feel so out of control with this.

1469,I just completed treatment at a mental health facility! I never thought there was hope for me,"I’ve been struggling with mental illness for years and it’s gotten progressively worse. I decided to check myself into an inpatient intensive mental health facility and two months later, I have come out on top! I’m not “cured”, but I finally have the motivation and tools to work on my mental health! I never wanted to put in effort and almost felt comfortable in a poor state. Now, I know that I do NOT want to suffer any longer. I am taking ahold of my brain and guiding it how I want to. A huge part in my recovery is finding a support network and it has made all the difference. I have a long ways to go, but there is hope. I’m writing this to share that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Your mental health is the most important thing about you, put all your effort into taking care of yourself. Don’t allow your thoughts to consume you. You are beautiful, loved, and worthy! I am always here for all of you and I wish you nothing but the best :)"
1470,Can depression/anxiety cause a feeling of constant fatigue?,"I'm basically at a loss here because I constantly feel tired and have zero motivation.

I don't really remember a time I felt *great* but I was at a point where I was working out at least twice a week and it didn't feel forced in any aspect.

  Now it's like I literally have to FORCE myself to do anything outside of normal daily tasks. Everything seems like a chore and I'm at a loss of what to do to just get some general motivation back and at least enjoy SOME things.

Legitimately, almost everything I do seems forced. I used to love recording music and I put it off for like 3 days that I had open because I felt overwhelmed just thinking about it. I used to love listening to loud music and just vibing, it seems I can't even enjoy that.

My diet is clean keto, I'm pretty sure I stay hydrated, no drugs/medication/ very rarely have alcohol. 

Was thinking it'd pass but I've mostly felt this way for a year with scattered good days, however those days are maybe a couple times a month and there's no pattern they follow, seems completely random. I've tried to figure this out but I'm starting to wonder if it's just mental or maybe there's an imbalance somewhere else, maybe both. 

It just hit me today that I sent my wife a text

 ""I feel like shit"" and I'm constantly sending that text.

I see other people laughing and having energy and doing things. I'm not trying to NOT do those things, I just want to get back to a base level, I understand you can't feel great all the time, but this is ridiculous."
1471,I don’t have the motivation to want to be alive any more,"I have no energy or motivation to attempt to live an enjoyable life any more. I’ve always struggled but it’s like lockdowns and isolation has sucked all of the joy I used to feel away from me.

I have no motivation to reach out to friends or family or reply to their messages and I’m doing the bare minimum for people to not think they should be worried about me. I’m so lonely but I just don’t have the will or the energy to try any more.

I don’t have the motivation to work and I feel numb sitting at my desk all day alone, and then spending every evening and every weekend alone.

I’ve forgotten what life felt like before the pandemic and I can’t envisage a life beyond it any more.

I’m not suicidal but I think I would feel relief if I discovered that I’m dying."
1472,"""Mental illness"" is just a phrase","
If depression, let's say, can be genetically inherited, then it shouldn't be treated as a mental illness, but simply a common birth defect. Just like addiction, schizophrenia, anxiety, etc. To think that these mental issues are so stigmatized in our society, when someone with muscular dystrophy or hypothyroidism is cared for and treated with acceptance, is completely preposterous."
1473,"I can easily numb myself, most times, by only focusing on doing it. Does anyone else relate?","I can have panic attacks, my emotions can be acting up and all can feel unbearable. In all of that there is something I can easily do. I can numb myself. It doesn't work all the time, but mostly.

The main thing is that I first of all need to remember it's a thing I can do. It can be hard to remember at a moment I feel like I'm dying though. Also, I have to completely focus on doing it, nothing else. It'll only take all from 5-20 seconds to numb myself.

I've mentioned this to my psychologist and employees at the child welfare institution I'm living at (I think it's called that), but none of them seemed to really understand. Honestly, I'm just curious if anyone else relates or has experienced anything similar.

I haven't always done this. It's a thing I many months ago realised I could do. I've started doing it more frequently, but I only do when I feel it's necessary. Which is more often than I'd like.

Disclaimer: I do realise that avoiding emotions isn't the best thing, but oh well. It does set me at a risk of instead of just staying numb for an hour or so, I do for a couple of days, if not weeks."
1474,How I failed .,"So this is my situation .At the end of the month I turn 34 and I have accomplished absolutely nothing in my life. I have never had a job I have no friends and I do not speak to my Family. I went to University and I got a Masters that I never did anything with. I am looking back at my life and its not good.

When I was 13 I had something close to a mental breakdown and I dropped out of School. My Parents had no idea about what to do or how to handle it so until I was 17 I was a total shut in. I missed out on my education and all the teenage stuff. Anyway when I was 21 I moved to live with my aunt in the city I joined an adult education Program and I got into University and for the next 5 years I studied and ended up with a Masters.

I had a chance to turn my life around with education but I completely fucking blew it. When I was 22 I was like a 12 year old, I never thought about a career or about what I should be doing now to plan for the future. I was so fucking immature. I went to see a career adviser when I was 23 and when she saw that I had not worked she was amazed and that made me feel like shit so I never went again. No excuses though I should have.

I have such a feeling of shame about everything that I cant put it into words . The feeling of worthlessness is intense and the idea of continuing  to live just for the sake of it  does not make sense.  

I have never been able to connect with anyone ever .At University I think most People thought I was a giant weirdo which I guess I am but I never put myself out their. I am Dyspraxic and dyselxic which does not make things easier but still I had a second chance and I never took it. After studying I went travelling for like the next six years I went Pretty much all over Europe and Latin America and it was great but in reality I was running from my situation. Anyway 2020 came and all that came to a halt I was stuck inside and left to really think about what a fucking loser I am.

My aunt has terminal cancer and at the end of last year I took two overdoses and ended up in a psych ward for a brief time. I got here because I took all the easy options when I was younger . I never challenged myself and that is why I am in the position i am in.I do not deserve sympathy."
1475,I feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown,I have so many deadlines at work but I feel so stressed. I really need to take a vacation. I don't know what to do. If I should just call in sick tomorrow or what or mention to my manager that I'm not doing well. I tried to talk to him about it today but as usual he didn't care. I felt like screaming so many times today. I really feel like I'm going to have a breakdown unless I take a vacation soon. I have a vacation in Feb but I don't think I can wait that long. I don't know what to do.I'm also looking for a new job that wouldn't be so stressful. 
1476,I cannot stop.,"Every single day I have consistently felt horrible and miserable and anxious and angry and just fucking everything. But tonight out of the last while I feel fucking abysmal. I am panicking a lot and cannot stop fidgeting out of stress. I have felt depressed a lot over this passing year and have done nothing about it. I do not want to talk about it to a professional or friends and I do not want to hurt myself. I continue to let it fester and burn a deeper and deeper hole like a ball of hot nickel in a block of butter. I have never ever ever in my life felt the compulsion to hurt myself, or anything similar. But tonight I feel like it would be preferable to how I feel right now. I know for a fact I wouldn't let myself do it if I got close but fuck I just feel so horrible. I lost all of my friends this week. I have only one friend I can confide in and I feel like literally every worry I have in the world would wash away if I could just see them and give them a hug but they arent allowed to meet and haven't been able to for the past while. As I type this my fingers are beginning to tingle and its getting harder and harder to move them. I just want to give them a hug. That's all I want. I don't know how they do it but every time we talk my feelings vanish but I just cant see them. I don't want to talk to them about this. In a weird way I want to keep letting it fester in the sense that it has caused this feeling to happen far less frequently as I am most often able to get myself to forget about it or distract myself. I have no place to scream to let it out or anything I feel like doing with myself. I just feel like I need to keep letting it happen as it has been but I want so badly for this all to stop. My entire body feels like tv static and i look very pale in my reflection. I'm sorry this is all so sloppily written I just cant focus. I don't even necessarily need anyone to respond to this I just want to know what to do. I'm sorry."
1477,Job Search process,"Feeling dejected while finding for a job amidst this covid season. It isnt easy dealing with rejection emails one after another and also not hearing any response after going for job interviews.

Also probably is just me putting too much pressure on myself and kind of not feeling well with nausea."
1478,I really need advice,"I have been dating a guy for a while that I really care about. I have issues opening up I'm in the process of getting professional help for these issues. They are damaging our relationship basically I feel like whenever I'm trying to get to know someone or bring someone close my brain puts up these walls that I don't even want there it feels out of my control basically when im around them my brain half shuts off and heavily censors me with the little thoughts I can manage to think and It just feels impossible to be myself. This issues randomly gets better and than worse. That on top of just generally being depressed and dissociated makes things hard. You might ask why im in a relationship to begin with that's because I have had these issues for years and built close healthly relationships despite them with some incredibly patient awesome people. With the nature of our relationship how intimate it's been and with how much he's opened up.(I have still been opening up much faster than normal which sadly still is not fast) I guess this is an issues and makes him feel like I'm not interested in becoming closer to him, including him more in my life(what goes on in my head, and getting to know him better. Does anyone have any advice? (Please no breaking up at the end of the day we will both do what makes us happy if the issues becomes big enough or dont improve and thats what either of us want we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.)"
1479,Went out for a walk after God-knows-how-long,"I've been depressed and have had struggles with my anxiety for a long time and it has been worse for the past few months. After a very long time, I was finally allowed to go for therapy and today, I got up from my bed(which was very hard) and went for a 20 minute walk. It's the first time I've got physical exercise in more than what I'm guessing to be 6 months and I'm proud that I was able to get up and go out. To all the people out there, who are trying, just try to push yourself a little bit everyday until you get there. In the end, it's gonna be worth it."
1480,I don't know what to do anymore,"So hay a few weeks ago I joined this very supportive subreddit and made a post about my messed up mental state and well... Sense than, I'm pretty sure it has gotten much worse 

so I suppose I should start at the beginning, about 3 years back I had harmed myself at school for getting myself in trouble (Basically I punished myself) Skip forward to maybe a month or two ago I started to think about the future think about things I did not want to, think about dyeing thinking about never being remembered worrying that I will die a virgin or without have even kissed a girl 

sense about two weeks ago I started to do something...  right before my nightly routine I turn on the sink than... well... I choke myself...                                                                     at first it was just 2-5 seconds but now its gotten up to 15 and I just don't know what to do

 I'm worried I'm a masochist and I am pretty sure I have self esteem issues I'm worried that I will kill myself soon and I'm only 14 so I cant get help without telling someone myself what do I do!?!

1481,Peoples words won’t define you.,"Hey. 

So I am going to keep this short.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 12. School,work, and finding the balance to do all of these as a collective have always been a challenge for me. I grew up with so many people telling me so many different things. I remember this vividly. I couldn’t grasp the concept of graphing in woodworking class, and a teacher called me a “waste to humanity” I was in grade 8.... I grew up with a lot of doubt in what I could do, and people telling me I couldn’t do this because of this reason etc. But I pulled through. I made it through university and I worked my way up and became a Life Skills Counsellor at a High School.

I recently lost my job due to covid and with a busy mind and my eagerness to keep busy I wanted to do something that was positive. I have always loved to make people laugh, I did stand up for a year, it was meh... but sometimes funny. But anyway. I have always loved streaming and the internet in general so I started doing that, and working away at it. I do talks on mental health and life, hang out and chat with people, play games and just generally try to build a good sense of community. So if you want to join me on this adventure that would be nice.. thank you!

I understand that self worth, self love, and inner peace are coming from within. But then, how do you fulfill biological needs. How do you find that ""within you"" without a partner?

1484,I left home,"I was at home since the pandemic first started. School was cancelled and my parents made my brother and I take online classes this year. I don’t have many hobbies that let me leave the house and I can’t drive, unlike my brother. I’ve been in the house for essentially a year straight. 

I finally broke. I asked my mom if I could stay at my grandma’s house for a while. I’m hoping the change of scenery will finally do some good for me. I have social phobia and GAD, but even though I was fine not seeing people, it still got to me, I’ve been so mentally messed up this past while that I really just want it to be over with. I’m trying. And I guess I needed a place to vent for a moment."
1485,What is my problem?,"I have been really struggling to get a job. Here’s why. 

I need money to live, and to do my work in gamedev and technology. But, I can’t keep a job for more than a month. The corporation’s complete disregard for customers, employees, the economy, and the future at large in favor of personal gain aggravates me to no end, the exhausted feeling I have at the end of it and the miserable bore during it, the list goes on. 

A major issue is that my job can’t really be automated. It must be a person handling customers, it must be a person stocking the shelves, it must be a person pulling off and putting on tags, or making food, or pouring coffee. I feel like nothing I do matters in these companies, just an easily-replaceable cog in a machine that prints out free money to those who do not work. 

How do I shed this feeling, this animosity towards the company? Do I go on autopilot? How do I learn how to use autopilot without my own music? How do I gather the energy afterwards, to do what I want?"

I don't trust anyone close to me with my mental health, i feel like im too much, but also not enough at the same time. im scared they wont support me and try to get away from me, especially that im queer in a homophobic, religous conservative household. everything is so intense and i cant take it anymore. all of these recent events, even in the past 2 years have taken my life from me, and i dont know what to do, i just need someone to empathize and show they care. thanks, please leave a response, id really appreciate it 😊"
1487,Why do I randomly get an overwhelming feeling of dread?,"Sometimes I'm just getting some water, brushing my teeth, etc, and all of a sudden I feel a sense of impending doom. I feel like I need to get the hell out of the area I'm in right away, or else something horrible will happen.

I usually stop it by getting back to my room as quickly as possible as soon as I'm done with whatever I was doing, and the feeling goes away after about five or so minutes, but does anyone know why this happens? I don't know if I need to say this, but just in case, I'm 16"
1488,I got involved in drama and it put me on my ass,"Warning: I pretty much wrote a whole book

I think it’s safe to say everyone is having a hard time right now. Some more than others. I myself am very lucky. My life could be so much worse. I’m still struggling though. The last two years have been difficult for me. I’m 16 and in 2019 I lost my Grandfather whom I was very close with. This was a big hit to my family and I. It was a painful couple of months of seeing the deterioration of a loved ones health. With the loss of my grandfather still raw, I started my Sophomore year. I happened to meet some new friends. Two girls, both taken, had decided to show interest in me. I became friends with these girls, and because they often made bad decisions, I tried to guide them. The one friend dated a different guy every week. She showed constant interest in me, but I was uninterested due to her poor relationship history. The other girl was dating a really nice guy. He had issues at home and was often suicidal. Although her boyfriend was emotionally weak due to home troubles, she decided that he wasn’t providing her with enough attention, and she took an interest in my best friend. My best friend and this girl sexted constantly. The other girl started dating another one of my friends. She was constantly complaining about the lack of sex she was having in general and with my friend. I thought this was bullshit considering we were just kids. The two girls were constantly leaning on me for answers about their relationships. The one girl was asking what to do about her affair with my friend, and the other was asking me if she should be giving my other friend hand jobs. The chaos and constant pressure on me to be making absurd decisions for my friends was wearing on me. I thought the actions of my friends were foolish, but out of fear for loosing them, I mostly kept my mouth shut. In an attempt to do something for myself, I started talking to another girl. Although she was friends with the others, she was different. She was a smart young woman who didn’t bullshit. Right around this time is when my school shut down due to Coronavirus. With no incentive to do my school work, my once good grades plummeted to 40’s. I was eating very little and I was miserable. One of the only things keeping me together was texting the smart girl. After three months of texting and many attempts on my part to do something in person, she started to drift away. My best friend was questioning his morals, being involved in an affair. Both him, and the girl who was cheating with him, were constantly complaining about each other to me. I had to play both sides of the argument to ensure I could still be friends with both of them. I was very concerned about the mental health of the boy who was being cheated on. His home troubles had gotten worse and if he found out that his girlfriend was cheating on him, he would’ve most definitely killed himself. Luckily the affair ended. My friend got upset that the girl wouldn’t leave her suicidal boyfriend to date him. With my best friend and her no longer talking, I distanced myself from the girl. I couldn’t take the drama that was a result of being friends with her. I eventually was being completely ignored by the smart girl I was texting. This hurt me. I to this day still think she’s a nice person. I just don’t think I met her expectations (something I seem to never do). I was emotionally weak and very vulnerable. Over the next couple of months the girl who was previously dating my friend (the sex crazed one) was hitting on me all the time. I had convinced myself that I liked her and decided that I wanted to be in a relationship. Turns out she wasn’t attracted to me enough to be in a relationship with me. Her family adored me and although she could be selfish, I agreed to be her friend still. She continued to make poor decisions and to date more sleezy guys. She was constantly acting like she was being punished by god... like her actions weren’t what was bestowing these sleezy guys on her. After an incredibly slutty question was texted to me from her on Thanksgiving this year, I ended our friendship. Although I seem to attract it, I hate drama. I was done dealing with the two girls who brought all of this drama in my life. I can proudly say I am no longer friends with either of them.  I’m ashamed of the fact that I was involved in this childish drama. Recently I’ve been thinking of the girl I texted for those three months when school closed. Now that the whole situation is over and I’ve had some time to reflect on it, I’ve really come to admire how genuine of a person she was, even despite her cruelly ignoring me eventually. I can’t get her off my mind and it feels so wrong considering how little of a chance there is that we’d ever be together. I’m genuinely scarred from the situation. Although the experiences I endured seem like nothing to some, what they showed me will stick with me forever. It showed me how senseless people can be. I feel like it was my fault. I could’ve avoided it all. What can I do in the future to better meet other’s expectations, and how do I distance myself from the drama of senseless people. The past two years have put me on my ass. I always just feel numb. I feel like I’m constantly in emotional shock. I’m still not eating right and I occasionally find my self drunk off my ass trying to vent the pain. How do I get back on my feet. I’m in constant emotional turmoil and I have nobody to talk to. My family and friends aren’t very sympathetic. They all know me as the fun goofy kid. I often find myself wearing a fake smile. This is an important part of my life and I’m sick of wasting it being upset (dare I say depressed). I’m hoping this is no more than teenage angst, but I have a feeling what I’ve learned and felt in the past two years and what I’m feeling now will follow me into my adulthood.

Any help or support is greatly appreciated"
1489,My friend tried to kill herself,"The other week my friend tried to kill herself (just before the new year), I knew she wanted to die and I did as she wished and didn’t tell anyone, anyways she survived but I’m petrified on what to do now, I’m trying to comfort her as best as I can but we live on different states"
1490,Why do I see faces before I fall asleep?,"So recently I have been seeing strange, often scary or disturbing faces when I close my eyes to sleep. I did some research on the topic, but everything that seemed relevant was related to ""clairvoyance"" and other spiritual stuff that I have never really believed in. So, I came here, to a largely science-based sub to see if anyone has had similar experience or has an answer to why it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

So a quick description of what I see. It usually starts as a flashing shape, then that shape becomes a portion of a face that quickly flashes before disappearing. These flashing shapes can be noses, eyes, or any other part of a face. It seems to happen automatically, as it happens when I am completely at rest and not thinking about them at all.

Typically, the faces that appear are terrifying. Missing eyes, abnormally small/large facial features, eerie smiles, etc.

Sometimes, the faces are small, and appear at the edge of my vision. However, sometimes, they are extremely large and right in the center.

The whole face isn't always there. Sometimes, it's just the eyes and mouth, with nothing between them.

I have lost sleep because of these faces and I don't know how to make them stop appearing. If anyone knows what to do, your help would be greatly appreciated.

1491,How could I ease an addictive personality?,"Due to genetics I’m at a high risk of addiction, to anything. I purposely try to stay away from drugs and alcohol but sometimes I slip up. Recently I’ve deleted a few social medias because I got addicted to them. Now I feel im developing an addiction to video games. It’s like I constantly have to obsess over something to feel happy. I do have some mental health issues, PTSD, ADHD, depression and anxiety but I don’t believe this has anything to do with that. I’d like to find a way to moderately enjoy things."
1492,I can't do it anymore.,"I'm done trying. I guess I must be cursed. 

I've been trying for a ridiculously long time to see the proverbial ""light at the end of the tunnel"". All I've done is found my way into this space that is vantablack where nothing makes sense. Here, there is no light. Constant and severe depression, constant high anxiety with panic at times and agoraphobia. Literal constant (not only psychological, but also physical) pain for the past 30+ years. I can't try to find this light anymore. It doesn't exist. And that's okay."
1493,Am I depressed?,[deleted]
1494,Please answer without judging.,"Hello, here with a really weird question.
What would you do if you were me?
My life atm is like this:
I had an ischemic stroke due to stress at 14, losing the ability to speak normally for 5 days, living alone in an apartment, away from my family. This is also when suicide thoughts came in my life, with 3 attempts so far..

Moved countries as a 15yo so I can live with my family. Started and also left college so I can work, make money and buy things for myself.
Broke up with my first high school love years after we met.
Made money, but spend it all on computer parts, food and games.
Coronavirus came, left jobless, with  
I have never felt joy in my life for the past 3 years.
I wake up more tired each day.
When I close my eyes I can only imagine how I can die in peace.
I have absolutely no friends but family.
Developed insomnia due to severe anxiety, can only sleep in the daytime.
I regret every decision I ve made in the past 2 years, but I keep doing it.
If you were me, what would you do to improve yourself?, I had people tell me just be happy, others have it worse. I know others have it worse, but I think that does not help me in fighting my mental problems, this beast named anxiety just makes my life a living hell.
I also feel no happiness. It's like I m just empty. I tried booking a therapy session but when they called me back I just panicked and did not answer my phone/ twice. I guess this was just my anxiety.
 
What would you do to improve yourself and your mental health? Or, how do you people cope with those feelings? I am just hopeless and lonely, I would love to hear your opinions or advice. Thank you."
1495,How do you not be toxic?,"I'm a 15 y old enbybitch, and I've posted this shit on so many subreddits but literally how do you stop being toxic as a person? I go to counselling but my counsellor is no help at ALL, she keeps normalizing my toxic personality traits and assuring me that it's totally fine even though it's clearly not and I don't think she should be encouraging my trashass behaviour?

I'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety and autism but I doubt any of that is contributing to my personality being overall wtf????

So I guess I should list out what fucked up traits I have and elaborate a bit, since I rarely actually explain which makes people think that I'm hyperempathetic or whatever the fuckity fuck.

\- I use people.

Not just in a sense where I think they should be helpful. I see my friends as tools. Trust me, I've tried to not have such a fucked up way of thinking but I can't help it. When I was younger I'd always be by myself but i wasn't as conscious of my way of thinking and how wrong it was. In gr 7 I got endless lectures from adults so I decided to hang out with these girls so I'd stop getting lectured. Near the end of the year, I felt guilty about it so I stopped, considering the fact that I saw them as nothing but a way of getting me out of annoying lectures and as competition (we'd play sporty games during breaks and I'd try to get better than them even though i'm bad at sports)

I get called selfish because I don't care to befriend anyone I can't use, which is true but the thing is I literally can't not think like that. It's my brain's default response. As soon as i meet someone, I wonder what use they will be to me.

I know it's fucked up, and I'm NOT asking for justification, since yk, being toxic trash isn't justifiable. Don't bother victimizing me, it's annoying. I just want to know how to not be trash"
1496,I have been struggling lately and I need some second views.,"Alright so I had some good changes during my 19 years of life. I am currently in therapy because after around 16 years old I realized I couldn’t go on anymore without telling anyone and I started to become a danger to myself, my depression has been there for a long time and I finally found the courage to tell my mom who took me to the doctors, I got diagnosed with my depression and finally after 9 years of it I got the help I needed. I started to take my anti depressants that I asked for because I couldn’t trust myself enough without it and I’m slowly making progress in realizing my trauma’s that I never really thought were wrong and giving it a spot while working on my current situation with my dad which isn’t the best but improving: more on my side then his but some things you can’t ask for in life. Now my problem is that lately due to some things that have been said to me by both my family and bullies all throughout my life that have been not so nice I have been questioning allot of my food habits. I myself am overweight but not obese, I have been stuck with the idea of not eating lately simply because my idiot brain tells me I’m fat, I have been keeping count of what kind of calories are in foods and fats more then I ever did in my life and even skipping some foods entirely because of some of the things in them even if they aren’t so bad. The last year I have been eating pasta and fries exclusively because we don’t have much money at home and my mom refuses to make healthy meals that nobody will eat and will eventually be thrown away. I totally get this on her side and I myself can’t really cook due to me never having learned and getting insulted by my dad because I didn’t know how and being called fat if I made some food and asking if I was sure if I wanted that(this is by far the least worst of emotional abuse I got from him but it still stings): even though nobody ever offered me to learn and I tried myself which went wrong. Now my problem is that the constant idea of my weight has gone out of hand: I’m currently on one meal a day and if I am lucky I eat some bread in the morning which is maybe once in two weeks. I only drink water and tea due to sugars in other drinks even in smoothies yet I still get insulted for being too fat mainly by my dad. I have been losing weight quite quickly lately while I haven’t been doing much to do so and get praised for this yet I am starting to get the feeling that something is off. I don’t know how to pick this up with people because I feel like I am the only one to blame for this. One side of me wants to eat healthy yet the other side of my grew so used to getting comments about my food that I feel dislike at everything else. My dad has a dislike against any meat less foods or anything that doesn’t contain allot of calories since he thinks people are trying to control his life and the government and socialist want everyone to become vegan so doing that isn’t really a option on my household even though I wouldn’t mind it. 

Can someone please give me some advise on what should I do? Am I right to only blame myself for this and is it okay if I blame my parents as well? I feel like it’s wrong to do and only my fault and I’m not sure what to make of all this. If anyone can help me or at least give me some advice I would really appreciate it, it’s fine if you don’t have any advice but simply want to share your thoughts or story. I’m always open to listen and you’re story is valid ❤️"
1497,Anyone wanna chat?,"Hey I got alot on my mind, I'm not in danger I just need to talk to someone if someone wants to listen to a fun an awesome story about my sexuality. It's actually very positive stuff DM me"
1498,i don’t know what i’m feeling,"i don’t know how to describe it. i feel so...empty. i feel like crying all the time, and i have absolutely no motivation to do anything. i wake up with the most dreadful feeling for the day ahead, and i never want to get up. i just want to lie there forever and do nothing. i used to love going out, but now i don’t even want to leave my house. homework and classwork was never really an issue for me, but now i just really don’t want to do it. like REALLY don’t want to do it. i feel so tired and drained everyday, no matter how much sleep i get. i dread doing simple chores that i used to be fine with before, and etc.

also everyone irritates me. if i hear one person in class speak i just get so fucking angry for no reason. the sound of their voice boils my blood and i don’t even know WHY. at this point it’s like i hate everyone, but i also feel so alone at the same time. when school went online i wasn’t able to see people everyday. i cant see my friends anymore, relatives, etc. i feel so alone, like i have no one there to support me, no one to vent to, just complete isolation. no one checks and asks how i’m doing, unless i initiate it first. 

i felt as if this was depression, but i also don’t know what it truly feels like and i don’t want to self diagnose. the thing is, sometimes i feel fine, excited, happy, but then all of a sudden, all that happiness disappears for no reason, and i’m back in my cloud. 

everyday is the same. everyday feels the same. it’s like i’m existing but not..living. i’m just here."
1499,Please help,I attempted suicide with this girl on reddit that I was talking to on another account but my phone got disabled and I got a new phone. So when i came back from the mental hospital i realized i couldn't get in contact with her because I don't remember my password for the account or her username. I don't know what to do. I'm worried about her.
1500,i feel like i’m mourning my own death,"i just can’t get the thought out of my head that my life is already over. a little bit ago i had a mental breakdown and i was clutching my stomach and screaming in my head that i’m going to die. I’ve only ever talked to one other person about this and, at the time, they made me feel a lot better... but the thought that my life is over or that its going soon or that someday i won’t even remember myself won’t leave. my mom has a really terrible memory and i’m scared that she’ll get dementia and forget everything. and i’m scared that i’ll forget my own life too. the whole thought of growing up and undeniably losing my memories is so... i don’t know. it just fills me with dread. i don’t know if i’m just being a stupid existential teenager or whatever, but... i don’t know, i just want help."
1501,How can I stop procrastinating so much?,I really gotta stop procrastinating with schoolwork and stuff like that. What are some tips with helping with that?
1502,I’ll never be good enough.,Nothing here.
1503,i think i’m having olfactory hallucinations ??,"tldr: i have been struggling mentally and in my relationship and the constant unexplained smell of her perfume is bothering me. what could that be about?

ok, so

there’s this girl i really like, and we’ve been kind of dating for a few months and i was so happy for about a month but things have been going steadily downhill as most relationships i have do so i’ve been panicking and feeling really low, mostly about this. i think it might be a depressive episode, i’ve never had one before so idrk. but anyways, maybe two weeks ago i had this really strong emotion in my stomach where i was just like sort of at the top of the world and all floaty but really weird and this is when it started. my girlfriend wears this distinct perfume that doesn’t really smell like anything but itself and usually lingers around her and stands out when she gets in a car. since a couple weeks ago, inside and outside, i smell the way her perfume is in a car all the time. at first i wondered if it was something i had around my room, but it came and went and followed me around very randomly. i didn’t mind during that floaty period because it reminded me of her when i couldn’t physically be with her and at that point we were doing well. since a week ago, i haven’t slept, i’ve cried every day, i have no appetite, i feel unloved, i don’t want to talk to anyone. yesterday i expressed to my girlfriend about how i had been trying to get reassurance from people because i felt unloved and that she kept pulling back from stuff like that and she admitted she didn’t want to get too close to me because she doesn’t want things to end badly which was sort of out of left field. at that point, the perfume smell has been a little annoying but still nice but now it just makes me feel even sicker and sadder than usual and it’s so distracting and unsettling. has anyone experienced this or does anyone know what that’s about?"
1504,Why am I sleeping so much?,"I could sleep for 10 hours, stay awake for three, and go back to bed for another 8-10 hours. Why am I doing this? I feel exhausted when I do wake up and it’s hard for me to get out of bed. I have a history of mental illness, but this feels really extreme. Should I see a doctor or wait this out? Been like this for about a week or two."
1505,I (20F) Am Feeling Depressed While Seeing My Family,"(Sorry, this is going to be long)
I don't know what happened. I've been so excited to finally get to see my family after a year, but a day after I got there, I've been almost nothing but miserable.
It started the day after I arrived. The first night was fine, no problems. The next day, my father took me and my teen sister out for a walk in the woods. It started fine. I thought it was nice nostalgia for when we would go on many walks in the woods when I was younger. 
And then I got sad. Very sad. 
I was on the verge tears for the rest of the walk and I couldn't figure out why. I kept thinking negative thoughts, of how terrible I am and imagining my parents saying bad things about me. I felt like I was remembering things they've said that hurt me (and there were times, though they really meant well), yet I also couldn't remember these times. It was just negativity poisoning my brain until the walk ended. My dad and sister kept asking me why I was crying and what was wrong and I said I didn't know, which is the truth, and that it's nothing, but they would keep asking. Eventually they gave up and I calmed down after the walk ended.
I felt semi-comfortable enough to talk to my sister about it later. I told her about memories of our parents that hurt me, thinking maybe that's what was bothering me. She agreed with me and we got along. 
She told my mom, and Mom called me into her room that night to talk to me about it. My sister told her I said it was Dad's fault. I told her it wasn't true, and I still didn't know why, but she wouldn't take that as an answer. I told her what I told my sister and she goes on to tell me that they never tried to hurt me and she thinks they did a great job as parents and I'm too sensitive and need to stop taking things so personally (and I know I do, I want to be better). We also talk about my insecurities, like how I'm struggling with what I want to do for college in the future, and she tells me that she thinks I'm depressed and should get counseling when I get back home (which I agree with).

Backstory: I've been struggling with various degrees of depression since I was 12. I've realized recently that I was in denial when I thought I wasn't depressed anymore (I'm living in an apartment and started attending a wonderful church with an amazing church family I felt so happy with), but I've been having a lack of motivation to try anything new when it comes to cooking, exercise, etc. after leaving work and would usually just sit in my room alone playing video games and sometimes cry for little/no reason. I didn't want to admit it, but now I think I have to that I'm still depressed. It hasn't been this serious in a long time though.

Ending the backstory, I didn't feel very understood or completely satisfied with the conversation, but I took it and tried to be happier.

A day or two later, I wanted to surprise my family. I didn't cook much, but I baked brownies and cookies a lot, and people at worked love them. For the first time, I overcooked the brownies, and was sad because I felt like a loser and a failure. Nothing much after that though, just my insecurity and feeling like I disappointed my family. They still actually liked them though, so it's good.

The other night, I was eating dinner with my family. I don't know what set it off - maybe it was listening to my sister's sarcastic, whiny voice she uses to complain that I always hated hearing (I love my sister but she's so annoying sometimes) or seeing my parents yell at my other two younger sisters - but I was upset again. I guess I managed to hide it this time until I got to my room. My mom opened my door and saw me crying. I still didn't know why I was sad. She wouldn't leave when I asked her too, but she tried to help. She told me it hurt her to know I was crying in my room. We talked more on the counseling and other personal stuff and she left me alone after that.

Today was the straw that broke me and my mom's back.
I cried again at dinner tonight. I was on the verge of tears only because my sister and mother brought up me cutting my hair short. I cut it just above shoulder-length for convenience, because I don't want to put it up at my job. I struggle with my self-image a lot, but tried to improve and see myself in a better light while I was gone. They told me my hair did not look good and that it was greasy and I should wash it every night instead of every other night (I washed it LAST NIGHT). I know they meant well and wanted to help, but it still hurt me. I didn't want it to, but it did. I thought my hair looked good, but I guess not. My mom shouted at me for crying again. Told me to go to my room, said she was a few seconds away from calling my job and telling them I'm too unstable to work there anymore. She probably wasn't serious, but idk. Forgetting about sending me to my room, she asked me angrily why I was crying again. I knew this time and told her, and she told me the family does that to each other all the time and it's fine and they were only looking out for me even though I should be doing that for myself since I'm 20. I struggled not to show anymore sadness for the rest of dinner.

I feel like my family's getting sick of me, and I'm sick of feeling this way. I still had good times here with them, but this is really ruining this vacation I waited a year for. I don't know what to do. This was all over the course of a week, and I still have one week left before my flight home.
My parents and sister are good people that mean well, but I just can't seem to be happy with them. I keep having thoughts like, ""This trip was a mistake"", ""I'm never coming back again"", and ""They think I'm a pathetic loser"".
That leads to now, as it's late, and I'm crying while typing this, because I want this to end. I feel like I'm a selfish, ungrateful, insecure, and overly sensitive adult child, but I still can't figure out why I'm so miserable! And I can't stop my sadness when it starts! I feel like I'm in an infinite cycle of feeling sorry for myself when I shouldn't be. I argue with myself in my head so much about this which causes more tears to fall.

So my questions are:
- What is wrong with me?
- How do I stop these feelings I and my family don't deserve to deal with?

Idk if this info helps, but along with having depression since 12, I also have Asperger's and a history of anxiety. And I do plan on getting counseling when I get home.

Thanks again for reading, feel free to ask any questions for better context, and I'll answer to the best of my ability."
1506,i don’t know if i can deal with school anymore,"i’m a high school student. i have undiagnosed (but very obvious) depression and anxiety. i’ve been a straight-a student since kindergarten, but my grades are really starting to decline lately. i can’t bring myself to do any of my work and thinking about going to school makes me anxious beyond words. i desperately need a break or just less work but i can’t just stop going to school. my family can’t afford therapy either so i can’t get help. i’m just losing hope at this point"
1507,Why am I so overwhelmed with simple tasks &amp; feel like I have no control over myself?,"I’ve been having issues this past year with just feeling soooo overwhelmed with every little thing and it’s really starting to affect my work &amp; relationships. I just can’t seem to get the motivation to complete simple tasks like getting dressed and going to work. Even though the amount of stuff that I need to do in a day is so little and my job isn’t extremely hard(I work in a daycare) I just feel like there isn’t enough time in the day. I struggle with feeling like I have no control over myself bc it doesn’t matter how much I plan out my day or promise myself I’m going to do something, like clean my room or do laundry etc. when I wake up it’s like I’m a completely different person. I don’t want to get out of bed and can literally procrastinate all day it’s like I have zero willpower and that is not how I want to be at ALL. I used to be so productive and could go to school, work, exercise, eat healthy meals and do all the necessary cleaning but I can’t even get myself to do more than one of those a day. Has anyone else experienced this and know how to get out of this “funk”. I really need some help &amp; answers. 
I was diagnosed with adhd, anxiety, &amp; depression as a teen &amp; I think my issues probably have a lot to do with this."
1508,"Has anyone else lost ""friends"" that made it seem like your mental illness was a bigger inconvenience for them than it was for you?","I use the word ""friends"" loosely, because they no longer hold that title.

I went through a pretty rough phase of about six months. My depression and anxiety were at an all-time high. I won't go into all the details, but I just needed someone to be there for me.

I was told, by two friends of 10+ years, that my depression was ""too much,"" and that they ""couldn't handle it."" They told me that I needed to ""own up to my actions"" (being depressed, I guess???). Then, they just deleted me from everything and stopped talking to me. Some friends, eh?

Still makes me sick to this day. But perhaps, it's better to be rid of those people.

Don't get me wrong, I know it can be difficult when your friends don't have their shit together. But isn't that what friends are for? To support you and be there for you when you're in a dark place?

I can't even imagine doing what they did. But maybe that's just me.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced this as well. Please feel free to share your stories. Would be nice to know I'm not completely alone."
1509,Realizing something about myself,"I realized that I’m about as divided as a rubix cube. I feel like I go through these waves of being a raging narcissists, to feeling terrible and wanting to isolate from my issues, to a caring and incredibly creative person. All these different waves have started to take a toll on my physical and mental health like one day would be all cheery then the next I’m starting arguments with random folks over random bullshit.  I just wish this would be more consistent but hey that’s life."
1510,Question about Therapy Apps!,I’m not a fan of webcam face-to-face type therapy. Are there any text based options out there? Like I just want to be able to type something out and get a response from a therapist/counselor.
1511,Tired,"I'm tired of everything, I have friends I know they care about me a lot, and i care about them. That should make me happy and it does, I'm just sad a lot and life seems very pointless, I mean life is pointless but that's not the point lol. 
I don't see the point in going to sleep at night, so I only sleep when I can't stay awake, and then I don't see the point in getting up whenever I wake up, or the point in leaving the house, or doing schoolwork, the only point in eating or drinking seems to be to stop myself feeling uncomfortable from that. Life feels like a dream, with just the happy bit that my friends are a part of and then the rest of it is a bad dream or a confusing one. I can't always tell what memories are real or dreams, I don't think it matters very much either way.
Part of me wants to go to the GP or someone and try and fix myself, but I don't want to explain everything anymore, I just want to sleep and stop feeling everything and anxious all the time. I'm tired of life, I can't die cos that would hurt my friends so I'm not sure what I'll do."
1512,I feel so much dread,"idk where to post this so i’ll just do it here. I’ve been going to online school ever since the pandemic and an i loved it contrary to most people. I got to wake up when i wanted and do what i wanted. However i decided i wanted to see my friends again so i decided to go back to in person school this quarter. It’s one of the most awful choices i’ve made. The day before I started getting headaches and this feeling of dread of being there. This feeling of dread was with me all day today as well. I got a good nights rest but waking up was so difficult and the whole time i was at school i just didn’t want to be there. It’s not that people are mean to me or i hate my teachers. I have no idea i just hate the feeling of being there. The only thing that made it better was going to soccer practice. But when i came back home i was so drained and tired i fell asleep for 4 hours. I’ve already decided i’m doing only school for the next quarter but i don’t know how
im going to make it for this one. I felt like
the whole day was a waste of time and even when i came home the atmosphere was so depressing. This is probably going to be the longest 9 weeks of my life. Thanks for listening to my rant."
1513,I'm sad all the time,"I'm never really excited to do anything, I'm never actually happy, sometimes distracted, but never happy.  I don't know what to do.  I feel like this is all just a long very slow death.  I don't have anything I'd really miss if it were gone.  The only thing I actually want is someone to love and then to love me back, but I've lowered my self-esteem so much I constantly feel like I don't deserve it.  I don't have any dreams or aspirations.  I really hate myself.  I can't think of any good qualities."
1514,Loneliness hurts.,"Christmas and New Year has shown me how truly alone I am. Not a single call nor a message for me. Nothing. What did I do to deserve this? Were all those years of bullying I went through some sort of payment for something I did? Why must I be alone all of the time? Why must I feel empty despite being surrounded by people. My world is ending, I wish I could turn back time but I don't know what I even did to get this. Why must I spend 24/7 just staring at a screen without anyone ever acknowledging my existence? I could die in a ditch and no one would even realize. Everything I do is meaningless and does not make me move forward, I just slowly but surely regress into what I was supposed to be out of. I hate it. I hate whatever this is that pains me. I can't escape it, I don't know how to or what it even is. The fact I am writing this on a public forum with the vain hope of someone even reaching just makes me sink more and more into my misery. 
I hate myself."

1522,Questioning if I have ADD/ADHD after seeing a psychiatrist,"I'm not quite sure where to post this, so forgive me if it's a bit out of place in this subreddit.

About a year ago, I went to a psychiatrist after a college roommate pointed out that I had a lot of ADD/ADHD symptoms (he had it himself, hence his recommendation that I seek psychiatric help). I went to the nearest psychiatrist and was diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety. Over the course of the past year, I tried Prozac and Wellbutrin and felt no improvement in my day-to-day life. Apparently this was all my psychiatrist needed to simply tell me that I should try ""lifestyle changes"" such as reading and exercising more often, and definitely smoking less marijuana. I didn't debate it at the time and gave him the benefit of the doubt. It's not like I was exercising regularly, I had been going rollerblading maybe once a month. Plus I fell out of an intense reading binge during which I finished 6 books in less than 5 months. I consider myself a bookworm, but after reading *Idaho* by Emily Ruskovich, it was really hard to jump into anything else right after.

However, after some more thought I found that I'd been applying these lifestyle changes intermittently throughout my life and found no change in my symptoms. This was especially true during my high school years (I'm currently 23), before I started smoking marijuana regularly. I did sports everyday in the afternoon and read a lot during my free time. Neither of these activities prevented me from facing the same problems I do today: low self-esteem, excessive procrastination, social anxiety, inability to focus. I remember ""doing well"" but always doing the bare minimum to get the good grades. For most tests, I waited until mere minutes before class to study off a friend. I only ever applied myself in art and English classes. B's weren't uncommon in the other subjects but I always knew in the back of my head that I could do better. 

There's more to the ADD/ADHD suspicions that I think of as minutiae, such as getting easily distracted and never being able to sit still and mild sensory overload, but it's difficult not to cross some of these off as anxiety symptoms or a result of underlying childhood trauma. For what it's worth, I was also a ""gifted child"" who burned out around middle school and almost flunked the 8th grade. Point is, I had the conversation with my psychiatrist when I first met him and again between each drug trial, and both times he kind of brushed it off and didn't push beyond a few assessments tests that measured the intensity of my (depression/anxiety) symptoms.

Should I go back to him and talk about these examples where lifestyle changes didn't significantly  alter my symptoms? Or give it a few more weeks to actually try these changes to my daily routine? Or see a different psychiatrist altogether? I couldn't help but feel utterly defeated after our last session when we ran out of medication options. I'm at a loss for which way ahead is the most pragmatic. I'm in my final year of college and the pandemic did me no favors with graduating on time. I know it isn't the end of the world, but I can't not feel the pressure to get my sh\*t together."

1524,Today I Have To Do It,"Tldr; Mum's dead, I'm a mess. Calling the doctor today finally

I need help, I admit it. I've been trying so hard, fighting with every bit of me to just stay afloat. But I can't live like this anymore. I've been awake all night, for the third time in about a week? Today I need to finally do it. I need to call the doctor and ask for help.

I've been spending ridiculous amounts of money, I refuse to think about how much I've spent because it's sad. All on useless stuff to make me temporarily feel better. I don't sleep, when I do it's either terrible or completely sound asleep for 14 hours. My ex left me because I was apparently acting weird, that I made her feel pushed away and she dumped me. 3 years together and 4 days later she had found someone else. Thanks! Silver lining, shows me what kind of woman she was. I didn't mean to push her away, I didn't realise I was. I was in my own world. So good luck to her new bloke, hope he never has a rough patch in his life...

Since I lost my mum last year I'm a shell. That same ex told me she felt like I had died with her that day, like I was entirely empty after that. Which was true. I adored my mum, she was the only person I was ever truly myself with. It was always just me and her, I had no brothers or sisters. My dad lived in another country. Christmas day I would wake up and it would just be me and her, I loved it. She was the perfect mum. I feel guilty struggling now because I feel like that reflects on her... Like me failing to cope shows maybe she didn't raise me properly. Which I know isn't true, but still.

Growing up I had anxiety and depression and my mum was an angel. The SECOND I seemed off, like something wasn't right. She had me go see a children's psychologist and get therapy. She made sure that I got help. Now no-ones going to do that for me and it's so hard to even bother. My dad was considerably older than my mum, just under 20 years difference. So what? I'm supposed to want to go and start a family and have all these achievements with no-one to share them with?

I wanted to make her proud, if anything I lived my life for it. I wanted to get a good job and treat her. I don't give a fuck what my family say, I was the only one who truly cared. Everyone else knew she had issues. Now she's dead before she's 50. I was the only one who tried.

But I need to keep telling myself she wouldn't want me to be like this, if she was here she would have booked me an appointment...if she was here I wouldn't need an appointment.

But yeah, today's the day. I'll hate asking for help, I always do. Then I know everything they'll say, all the training they get they all sound like the same person. This is my last chance, I'm living with family and unemployed. My life couldn't be any worse.

As Jordan Peterson says ""We all know there's a myriad of decisions you can make that will end up making your life worse, so what about focusing on making decisions and taking small steps towards a future that's actually worth living"". So today I am, today I call the doctor. Even if I hibernate and hide the rest of the month it's one proactive step to a livable future."
1525,"just need a place to vent a little, im sorry if its annoying","i have no concept of what a 'regular' friendship is like and how to gain friends the 'normal' way. im so scared of doing it wrong of angering those around me with my wealth of inexperience that im left in a permanent state of hiding from my emotions and hiding from the stress they cause. im always alone, im always convinced this is the safest route to go but im always left so completely depressed, so empty. im a shell of a human, this isnt even mentioning the fact im so scared of doing things wrong ive all but eliminated any possible likes and interests from my life. im so scared of being found out as the pathetic coward i am that i would rather die alone in my room than even attempt to pursue an interest. however this rambling runon pile of dogshit is just another example of a byproduct of my lack of understanding about 'regular' friendships. the only way ive been able to gain friends my entire life in a way i can control is through guilt. i have to guilt everyone around me in order for them to care about me, i cant be liked for what im interested in because ive already psyched myself out from any of that, i cant be liked for my personality because that changes nearly daily with the environment and how i want to be seen. the only way i know how to get people to like me is by guilting them through lies and deception. constantly making up stories about whatever seems to resonate with people, terrible parents, gender identity, even mental illness. i lie and lie and lie about anything because i *have to be liked i cannot live in a world where i am not universally praised. everything i have ever done in my life is for attention, is for pleasing the audience of people always judging me in my head. my brain does nothing but constantly explain my actions, my likes, my dislikes to an invisible force in my head. its exhausting but i have never lived a life without it i dont know how to stop because i dont know how i started. i wish i could die but im too much of a pussy coward to do anything but complain and complain and complain without making any changes. i do nothing but wait for people to fix me, i do nothing but wait for people to be guilted into liking me, im a nothing person. i am what i think the others around me want to see, i mold and change to every situation so that i am never hated so that i am always the saddest in the room so that i am always liked not out of genuine love but because if those around me didnt like me id kill myself. the fact that friendship is somewhat out of your control is terrifying to me so ive worked my whole life to control it, im a fucking coward, a compulsive liar, and a remnant of a human that should have died in october of 2019."
1526,Lost another Job,"I lost another job again and this time idk what I did wrong I showed up on time EVERYDAY didn’t call in once. They say it’s for performance issues which would make since I am slower than the other shipping guys but this time me getting fired hit hard. I can’t hold a job,relationship, or anything it feels like I’m a failure no matter what I do or try to do and this time I just snapped I guess, I didn’t even drive my car home I just walked, and kept on walking I didn’t know where I was going and halfway through that walk I was telling myself I might as well off myself save me a lot of time looking for a job and it would make me not be able to fail anymore. I’ve been on the verge even when I had this job and I’m scared that this is going be the straw that breaks the camels back I don’t want to do it but so far that tiny voice in my head telling me it would be better, to just do it then wasting away at life and feel like a failure everyday I wake up."
1527,"People in the UK, is it possible for me to change psychiatrist? How do I do it?","I'm under free care through the NHS so I don't know if I'm able to change psychiatrist.

1528,Feeling really panicked,"So tomorrow all of my boreding school stuff is getting returned which I’m glad because they only give me bad memories but i don’t remember we’re my cadet stuff is and I’m really freaking out because I don’t want my parents to have to pay for it back, and idk what to do, I’m afraid they will get mad and yell at me and I just can’t handle people being angry at me.

I really hate how bad of a memory I have and I just really don’t want my parents to get angry at me"
1529,this sucks,"I don't have anyone to talk to and living in an abusive environment is literally killing me. had to convince my family to not interfere with my therapy sessions which is all I have left. no friends no one to help me get out of this hell hole. no one to talk to.

I switched my routine so Im up at night working on my thesis, while everyone sleeps. this way I know I'm safe but it kills me being awake during the day. I had to wake up early today and it's killing me.

Im dissociating even more frequently than I ever have, I've got bruises and scratch marks on my body that I can't explain. I think it's self inflicted.

feels like I'm losing myself. and I'm questioning my sanity... my mother gaslights me and manipulates me. I feel like nothing anymore"
1530,Is it going away?,"First of: my mental problem is not as severe as what others have here, so I suggest you first go to the others.


So basically my brother has depression.
Sometimes (but didn't happen for 10 months or so) my brother would drink heavily late into the night up until puking in the house (where my parents, me and him live), my parents would assist him (mostly my mother, my father would be more annoyed than worried due to it happening (not anymore) every 2 months regularly on a Friday night). He is now recovering well (the fact that we both finished school in 2020 and he passed helped a lot I think). There are also some other issues which i do not want to specify.
Why am I talking about my brother? Well, because my problem is strongly linked to it


Now to my problem: when someone is quite loud and speaking ""as if noone is sleeping"", I wake up paralysed with fear and in cold sweat, fully in (i think) fight or flight mode with the fucking adrenaline making me instantly fully awake. I am immediately scared for my brother and if he is ok but i am too scared to go out of my bed.
This happened now 2 times in a row without anything bad happening (just my brother/parents accidentally speaking too loudly). The last time something actually bad happened was 10 months ago or so.

Is it going away? Maybe when it happens often enough my body will realise it's nothing too bad?"
1531,I need support because my brain is self-destructing,"Sorry this is gonna be long

I'm 16 years(m) old and I'm a junior in hs. I think I am depressed. I live life in a sort of numb state where if I do feel happiness it is short and fleeting but when I am alone the only things that bounce around my head are negative. I know it's going to sound cliche but this started when my best friend/dream girl asked me out before sophomore year. We broke up about 3-4 months into the relationship because she needed some time to work on herself, and then she promptly(about 3 days later) started dating a friend of mine. I've had self confidence and body dysmorphia for a lot of my life (I'm 6ft 250lbs so im overweight) and this hurt me badly. I'm in a weird state where I want to move on but there is no closure and the feelings, and hurt along with them, are still there. I dont want to talk with her about it for fear of pushing her away because we were really close friends. I would try therapy but I have trauma involving therapy. My parents divorced when I was 7 and they put me and my brother into therapy, but our sessions were held at the same time together, my brother hated it and would just scream and yell at the therapist the entire time. So therapy for me was just 1.5 hours of sitting on a couch next to my brother while blocking out the noise and not making any progress. I feel like a fucking puppet everywhere I go because I just change depending on who I'm talking to it's like I'm 50 different people because I'm just trying to put on a show to fit in and not get hurt. The only time I feel like I'm not lying to myself and everyone else is when I'm alone at night and all the self hatred and guilt and grief just eat me away inside but there isn't any emotion. I dont cry or get angry I just lay in bed wide awake bathed in my own self pity. I dont know what to do. I feel like my thoughts are dangerous but I dont want to tell anyone because my worst fear is having everyone I love distance themself from me, and I'm scared of having another negative experience in therapy."
1532,done.,"November of 2019 I decided I needed to make changes to my life so i decided to hit the gym HARD. I had been working out before but this time it was different. There was something instilled in me that turned me into a fucking work horse. I loved the gym. It was all I ever thought about. I would wake up at 4:30 to go to the gym and then head straight back after school. It was amazing and I was the happiest 15 year old on Earth. I thought,""This is it. I did it. I finally turned my life around. I'm getting good grades for the first time ever, i've got all these awesome friends, and I'm on track to being 170lbs of pure muscle at 5'9"". Then covid hit. Every gym in my area closed and we were out of school until further notice. I (and I think everyone else) thought it would all be over in a month or two. Sadly, that wasn't the case. Quarantine depression soon set in and I felt so lost, useless, and helpless. I lost 20 pounds and didn't have a grade higher than a C. Not being able to hangout with my friends destroyed me. Their parents all let them hangout while my parents strictly followed JB Prickzers (yes I spelt it wrong on purpose) tyrannical orders. fast forward a few months to about June. Summer break has now begun and my parents finally started letting me hangout with friends. This is when shit gets really, really good for me but also really, really bad. 

My close-knit circle of friends soon turned into a huge group of people and I can't even put into words how much fun we had. With new people came new things. One of those things was vaping. I had been around it since my freshman year of highschool  and I had stayed strong with resisting it up until now. All it took was one hit. One hit. I was hooked. Then came alcohol. I had been drinking since I was 13 up to this point and I decided to ""step it up"". I would down 5 shots of svedka before hanging out with my friends thinking it would make me have more fun. It didn't. Soon I started going to parties and that's when shit hit the fan HARD. 

It was 4th of July and this girl I had been talking to took me to one of her parties. Long story short I called my parents to pick me up. Think you can guess how that went. I soon started coming home drunk occasionally which destroyed my parents trust in me because even though I told them I didn't drink, I did. 

August 22nd, my brithday, I finally got my license and couldn't wait to drive around and speed down Grandview drive (in my big ole' F-150) just like my friends. What was a  fun filled day hanging out with friends and family took a turn for the worst when I came home at around 11pm. I walk in the door and my dad is furious. He found a bag of Busch I had stashed in the basement and chewed my ass for it and said that he and my mom worked so hard to give me a good birthday and I went behind their back and snuck alcohol into their house. my heart shattered. I cried in my room all night long thinking of how much of a disappointment I was to my parents how ungrateful they must think I am.

December 25th. Started off as a normal Christmas morning. Then came time to open gifts. Add I opened my parents gift I was shocked to see a $500 gift card to my favorite hunting store. I was overjoyed and shocked because my parents had never given me a gift of this magnitude before. I immediately gave them both a big hug and didn't stop saying ""thank you"" for a good 5 minutes. About an hour after this, my mom decided to clean my room (we were having family over and my room was going to be used by my aunt and uncle). she ended up finding a disposable vape and 8 empty cans of Busch. I said I was sorry and promised her I didn't vape anymore and she honestly didn't seem that mad. 10 minutes after this I went to the bathroom and took some hits of the vape I still had like I usually did. My mom enetered the bathroom right after me and said it smelled fruity. She ended up checking my pockets and found my vape. I'll never forget the look on her face when she said,""you lied to me? On Christmas?"". I was torn and filled with guilt. I seriously contemplated returning the gift card at the store and giving my parents back the $500. 

5 days ago, Im in a pissy mood, talking back to my parents and just being a brat. My mom and I get into a huge fight and she ends up not talking to me for like a day (my mom had never done this before and had usually came to comfort me 5 minutes after we had a bad fight which we rarely did). i almost ended it. I felt/feel like such a fuck up and such a disappointment to my parents considering how much they do for me. I don't think I'll ever be able to escape this deep depression I'm in.

Long story short: I'm depressed, no motivation to do ANYTHING, have no friends anymore, don't workout, feel like a complete failure to my parents, don't sleep at all, etc..

my life is ruined. my bad choices caught up to me and the emotional pain I feel right is unbearable. i'm almost numb with pain and I don't see a way out. I'm currently failing 3 classes and am on track to fail my junior year of highschool. i wish i was good kid, bro. this sucks."
1533,"I am a doomscroller, have a phone addiction, and I need help","For those unfamiliar with the term (I was until yesterday): **Doomscrolling** is the act of consuming a large quantity of negative online news, typically without pause, to the detriment of the mental health of the person consuming it.

It all started in March when I downloaded the BBC app to keep up with COVID news (now deleted it) but I can't seem to stop looking at the news - no joke I probably refresh news sites 20+ times a day and I'm constantly on Twitter.

I also work as a digital marketer and social media manager, but I don't think this is the problem as being completely honest I spend phone time looking at news and on personal social media... This is starting to affect my relationships, my husband says he may as well text me instead of talking to me IRL (joking most of the time but all comedy has truth in it, right?)

Anyway, I'd appreciate any advice."
1534,Everyone I care about leaves.,"18, Male. 
In October my ex left me for another man after a 4 year long commited relationship, a couple days later a friend I used to play video games with every day passed away. I was heartbroken for months. In November I was planning to leave my current country for good (Aruba) and live with my Nan in the US until I could stand on my own two feet. She passed away the same month I was planning to come out to visit her. 

Last month I got a bunch of posts from really upset kids talking about how one of my closest friends had sexually abused them, and I couldn't take it anymore. I lashed out, cried and I barely eat. Tonight, another one of my friends murdered his grandpa in cold blood. I'm just so overwhelmed.

I don't know what I did to deserve this, for months my entire world is falling apart and I'm so scared. It's like I'm being forced to watch all my relationships with people I care about crumble while I can't do anything. Everything is so scary everday and I don't trust anyone anymore. I'm scared to even talk to my old friends about anything."
1535,I get exhausted because I get stuck in unimportant decisions,"I truly need some help.
Exam season is coming up, and I’m in medschool, so the volume I have to revize and study is gigantic, so I need all my focus, memory and like mental power to be on the material.
However, I keep getting distracted by stupid things that truly don’t matter.

For example, my phone is breaking and I need a new one, but I can’t decide on a model, which is bothering me like crazy cause I just need to make up my mind although I won’t be able to buy one untill July.
Everyday i waste time and energy fretting about this stupid topic. 

If only this was the only issue, i also take a billion years deciding what to eat (I have ED tendencies so I suppose it’s to be expected.) when to work out, when to go shopping, when to do this or how to do that.
It seems that I overthink every single tiny decision even the ones in the distant future.

Has anyone experienced this? I truly need some advice or some of your experienced because I’m already exhausted and it’s 10 am, I only studied 4 chapters and I have 6 more."
1536,Life is in shambles as usual. (Kind of an aimless rant),"So a little over two weeks ago, my paternal grandma came home on hospice, she had been in and out of the hospital for a few years at this point. It was certainly not unexpected. But it still hurt to know she was close. My sibling had been living with her for some time at this point, making sure she could stay home and not have to be in a nursing home. Fast forward a few days and it's Christmas. My family was there and we had a good time. That was the last time she was fully aware and conscious. A couple days go by and it's now the 28th, my birthday. I planned to play some games and watch movies with my brother and best friend, but one got severely injured in an atv accident and was bed bound for the next 3 weeks. And the other wound up working a full shift that night. So not a great start to my birthday. Then at around 5:30, I get a call from my mom saying that my grandma said she is dying. I go over and and my grandma hosts her own wake. She called everyone she wanted to say goodbye to and was ready to go that night but she lived a few more days . On January 1st 2021 at 8:44 PM I receive a call that she is actively dying. Breathing has changed and I get out of work early and get there quick. I was there until 10:30 when I left to go home and get changed and cleaned up. But at 12:06 am I get another call. She was gone. Time of death was 11:55PM 1.1.21. after a year wear shit kept piling up, the first day of the new year tops all of it in one fell swoop. She was finally out of pain. But it still hurt. She was buried Wednesday morning. But of course the day takes a dramatic turn as you can see if you check the news. 


 My mental health has been deteriorating for the last couple years and I thought it was finally starting to look up and whack. But as of now I'm in a state of numb. It's just kept piling up over time. Many of my friends revealed that they don't like me. I haven't met anyone new outside of work since March when covid hit and shut down the school. I wasn't able to say goodbye to several people I liked, and I still haven't been able to go into the building to get my ceramics projects that were fired before spring break last year. My emotions have kind of stopped coming in. I hate that. My eyes are heavy every day and I just want it to go away. I'm extremely lonely, and I don't have any time for my passions. I'm working in a dead end job at pizza hut where I was promised a promotion 8 months ago that I never got. And I don't make enough money to take less hours, as well as not getting any paid time off or sick pay. I saved money and took a camping trip in October. Both of the people I was going to go with bailed last second. I went by myself and the weather took a sharp turn downward on the first night. I woke up with a migraine and turned my 4 day trip into a day and a half. I wish my brain would stop telling me that I'm not worthy of a good life. I just need a vacation where I'm not expected to be anywhere. Anc can just relax and find a reason to keep going. Or get a start on things I enjoy like making music or building models. 

A note to tag on the end. I'm not suicidal or committing self harm. I'm also shockingly sober because my paranoia that an emergency will happen while I'm drunk or high. I just really need a fucking break from life. It hasn't been a good time. I just need a hug but life is like ""haha no""."

1538,I don't know what I am doing,"I don't know what I am doing with my life. From a different person's perspective, my life is perfect. Have a job, recently got married, bought a home together. But I'm not happy with any of it. I don't even know how do I define happiness. 

I was recently diagnosed with depression. Therapist suggested some exercises but I just don't feel like doing them. I'm just ignoring everything and everyone. 

A lot of times I have found myself fantasizing about abandoning everything and starting afresh in a new location away from city life maybe somewhere in mountains. I feel I'm not fit enough to be in a relationship with someone, I feel like I'm destroying my SO's life as well. 

I don't even know what is my motive of making this post. I don't know what to do with my life. I am extremely unhappy with my job, but I have to continue it because I have loans to repay. I have no purpose.

I am not suicidal but I don't find any meaning in living. I just want to learn things but I give up very quickly. I want to explore places but I don't have the courage. 

I know it takes time for everything to happen but I don't have patience. 

I'm just a lost person.

1539,All I Feel is Anxiety,"Lately, I reach these stages of going to apply to 40 jobs in a week to suddenly not. I complain how I want a job and then the moment I’m set up with one, I can’t take it.

Not only does my anxiety rack up, I suddenly feel like I don’t deserve it. I’m useless, I can’t even drive cause I don’t have my license, and all that will happen to me is that I’ll be fired (for context, this happened at one of my previous jobs, they let me go saying I wasn’t responsible enough which ruined me for weeks). 

I feel like I’m being so picky with jobs, not grateful for what I’m getting. I want to tell myself I wouldn’t be happy there anyway, but all I can do is be angry at myself for how lazy I can be.

Then, this becomes a round of anxiety as I cry at night just being sick of complaining to myself and being uselsss and how ill never get out of this slump and I’ll just die being nothing."
1540,How rape accusations can hurt someone,A couple months ago I was falsely accused of rape from a boy who was spreading lies about me. I have proof that it was consensual and it will sit in my camera roll if it’s ever brought up again. But ever since then I’ve been completely paranoid and weary of everything I say or do. I’m nervous that someone will just accuse me of sexual assault or harassment at any point so I’m afraid to talk to anyone at this point. What do I do?
1541,Deleting everything until I feel better,"There are these times in life where I get upset and overwhelmed with not knowing how to deal with what I’m going thru to the point where I delete everything (social media, phone numbers, pictures that go back as far as 2007, etc.) and leaving everything behind for months on end. I can’t cope with the voices in my head that’s telling me “no ones here for you” and I’m silently suffering in my room alone bc I don’t know how to approach anyone with these thoughts in my head that constantly stop me from thinking rationally. These feelings last for months and it takes me a lot of courage to not tear open and burn everything that I’ve worked hard for over the last few years. Sometimes I just want to feel better and happy without fearing that I’m going to go thru another one of these moments in public. Where I’m just crying and barely breathing praying that maybe the voices and urges in my head will finally go away"

1546,I am tired,"I just want to be honest, and I find that I can't be honest to anyone. Not my boyfriend, not my mum, not my psychiatrist. My best bet would be my strangers so.

I am tired of life. I am not actively planning to die and I don't think I will do it soon, but it is because I don't want to hurt anyone with my death. I am tired of being nice and considerate. I want to be a villain, I want to do all the crazy things. I want to give up, I want to be allowed to give up. For once, I want to be taken care of, I want others to know how it's like to be hurt by everything. I am tired of hoping for a future. I am tired of being inevitably alone in my fight. I have lost interest in most everything, nothing gives me pleasure anymore.

But despite all these, I am alive, I am mostly functional, I work part time and I sometimes do exercise. So it must be fine right? Yes I have made some progress, but I will never recover, I have changed and I can't see my past anymore. I stopped crying, I stopped worrying, I don't stay in bed all day like I did. I have given those up too, those were fights too, but they were meaningless. Yes I am in a better place, I guess I don't deserve even the little bit of care and attention I had now. That's right, I am sorry, I am sorry. I am too tired for love and affection now, so if I can't help my beloved ones, of course I don't deserve to be saved either?

But please, please. It's just me. Encouraging words don't apply to me. You who are reading this post, you deserve love and care. I feel weird, I don't know why I am getting better. My mind may be healing but my soul is withering."
1547,"Opened up about my Neurological Condition to my friend's girlfriend, and I feel so weird about and vulnerable about it.","So I posted something about OCD self help on my WhatsAPP status and my friend's girlfriend who is a Therapist in training replied to it saying how happy she is seeing share such vital information about OCD on my WhatsAPP stories. So in return I told her that I was glad as I felt that I was hiding my vulnerabilities for far too long and then she asked Hiding? Then I was surprised she didn't figure it out by then cause she is pursuing her master's in Counseling Psychology then she told me her teacher's told her not to analyse people once they studied their abnormal psychology paper etc. Then I told her that I am healing from certain Neurological and Hormonal problems and am under Medication and Therapy for it. Then she opened up about her experience's with Mental and Emotional Trauma and we exchanged some anecdotes about our really bad and traumatic experiences but unfortunately didn't put a trigger warning while speaking about it. I just feel really heavy and vulnerable ever since I've opened up to her a few hours ago, like there's this weird feeling in my forehead that feels like a boulder is sitting on my head waiting to be lifted by a Crane or by getting reassurances from my kind reddit community here &lt;3 . Just feel really weird and teary eyed about it. Hope sharing it here will feel better and less emotionally heavy about it."

1549,from an extrovert to an introvert,"Hello. I’d like to start with a back story about myself: I used to be a very extroverted person, I’d always be out and about and making new friends. I was popular and liked to venture out of my comfort zone. It was like this when I was young til my early young adult life. Somehow after awhile, I became withdrawn. 

I started choosing staying at home than going out. I refuse to go out to even buy food so I order in almost everytime. My anxiety in crowds and even picking up a phone call has greatly worsened as well. Sometimes, I skip work because I don’t have the energy to get up or talk to people. Mostly, I refuse to go out because the outside noise and chatter tends to trigger my anxiety. 

My boyfriend says my mood is a rollercoaster: sometimes I’m very happy and energetic and then the next, I’m cold, quiet and distant. 

I tend to break down when I get drunk (if I’m on my own or with a close person). I’d cry and hyperventilate but most of the time I don’t even know nor understand why. I drink because it makes it easier to socialise. Without it, I’d be uneasy and nervous. 

After a few years, I’ve decided to book an appointment with psych but I’m still hesitant about going. I guess my question is, is it just me or is this something I should take seriously?"
1550,Parents didn’t think anything was wrong with me... some years later I’m still confused,"Hello, I’m kind of confused about some symptoms I’ve had during my childhood (I still have some of them) and if anyone could relate to me or give some advice/insight that would be great. Whenever I would watch a commercial on tv for toys or games I would repeat “I’m gonna get it” for the entirety of the commercial. Or I would say “cute” every three seconds and giggle which was creepy. I would smile at night when I was trying to sleep so that monsters wouldn’t try to get me. I had a thing where if my nails scratched against objects or a surface, I would have to “fix” it by “smoothing” it with my fingers because I was afraid that the scratch would turn into fire. When my hair would fall out, because humans shed too, I wouldn’t be able to let it fall onto the ground because I was afraid that would also start a fire. To this day (I’m almost 17) I can’t exhale when looking at loved ones/people or movie characters I like, but when I see like an evil character or someone I dislike I’m allowed to (I only inhale for family or “good” people.) I used to make small high pitched noises in the back of my throat (kind of like a sharp exhale) and if I couldn’t do it I would feel terrible. Same with like moving the back of my tongue up the back of my throat, I had to do that. I have to count to three before I swallow pills. When I was younger, the exhale/inhale problem was worse, it got to the point where whenever I was sitting in a car I would have to watch and inhale on other cars until they were out of sight. I just felt like something bad would happen if I didn’t. My head would whip around so that I could inhale on my house and furniture. I would always think “God is stupid” whenever I went to church and then freak out because I actually didn’t and I thought I would make God mad. I used to pray every night and it became this ritual because I HAD to include everyone and repeat the same exact prayer every night. I had to chew only on the right side because I was like “preserving” my left side? I’m left-handed and that led to me becoming obsessed with that, so if I maybe bumped my left hand or leg or whatever, I had to equalize it and do that same to my right hand. I still experience this, but more to just equalize. I have a lot of social anxiety issues that started later than whatever my childhood symptoms are started, but I don’t know if that would be connected to that. I honestly don’t know what that was about and that fact that I still deal with some of them to this day makes me feel like maybe I have an issue? My parents don’t want to believe or entertain the idea that I’m not perfect so I’m relying on Reddit. Please help."
1551,Feels like I cannot win against my mental health issues,"So just for context, I've had a bit of a ""fun"" life. I had always been bullied and teased at school despite being a normal person. I would self defend and act out and it would always get me into trouble. As for learning, I would do well. I would be able to read stuff and remember it, all the stupid little details and be able to apply them. I would achieve good grades at things that interested me and underachieve at things that I wasn't so fond of. I would have to go to places like CAMHS and Therapy 

That all changed when I was 17 and in sixth form. Suddenly, even in the subjects I was interested in, I started to struggle. I couldn't focus or concentrate, I would read something and then would forget the things I'd read and in a subject I got a B at in GCSE, I ended up getting an E at in AS Level. Which was a huge fall from grace considering it was one of the subjects I was really interested in. I went from being annoyed at bullies and things that would get to me to being more upset and worried to the point where things would come to a head and I would just breakdown.

Since then, I've had these issues and it's developed into anxiety and depression. I've been hopping between jobs since the first one I was in fell through after the people I worked with left and was replaced with new people and haven't really found a place I feel comfortable in and would eventually breakdown at because of the stress. I've had Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and am currently taking Sertraline but because I've finished my CBT, they want to take me off of the medication

Which leads me to today, the issue I'm having is that with my sertraline, I feel that I can think clearer and that my mind doesn't race so much, I can focus and concentrate a bit more but at the cost of feeling numb and absent and having no feelings at all.

It would be great to come off it but I'm finding that without it I'm just having tremors, my mind is once again racing and I'm just struggling to concentrate on anything. I feel extremely tired, more tired than I usually do considering I have chronic fatigue but I can feel emotions again, even if it is things like stress and worry and sadness.

So all in all, I don't know what to do because it feels like I can't win. The CBT didn't help, I don't feel like myself when I take my medication but they slightly help with my anxiety and help with my head racing and if I don't take them, I begin to feel more like myself but being myself means not being able to function in life, apparently."
1552,I've just given up on everything,"Over the past two or three years things have just been going downhill so quickly to the point I thought they couldn't get any worse. From that point it really felt like I hit the bottom, the worst part of life so I spent time building myself back up- it wasn't perfect but it was better- I had goals, I had dreams I was trying in school, I was finding myself and who I was. 

I've always struggled with being very shy, panicking when talking to anyone, not having many friends- when I was just starting school, when I was 4 to about 7 or 8 I just sat on a bench by my self on the playground- I didn't mind and it wasn't like I was being bullied I just like the company of me myself and I, I was just kinda existing. I mean the average 6 year old doesn't really have  any plans for life anyway, so I guess in a way we all are just existing for a while. Then as I got older and went to secondary school (high school), I just kinda kept existing there with shallow goals and fake hopes.

I feel like that's where it all started to fall apart. At first the work load was manageable and I got along much better with people there- I clung onto one person and we became close friends, and we still are practically joined at the hip. I gained a friend group which I still have and love and I felt like I finally had people who I could rely on and who I actually liked.

 slowly over time things just got so bad- I've always been forgetful but I forget and loose everything, the homework's to much and I just don't do it, classrooms are too loud, lights are too bright, lessons too long, chairs too uncomfortable, my head just feels so full and its pressing against my limits, I cant focus, and I just have given up. 

All my past dreams and goals feel fake, like I needed to have them, and they were just my best options, things that used to bring so much joy are dull, boring and frustrating and I cant bring myself to do them. With quarantine, things got so much better in some ways, so much worse in others. I don't have to talk to anyone, I can just lock myself in my room and not get annoyed at everything, which I know isn't healthy but its all I can do. My country is in strict quarantine at the moment and all schooling is online- I'm supposed to be doing it right now, but I some how lost my planner  one fucking day in  and now I don't remember  what time lesson starts and ends, and what I have next so I just sort of do the lessons I remember for however long I can bare them, then go cry or sleep or something.

When ever I just give up on a test, people always say 'what about your future!?'and 'but you cant give up on your GCSES.' I can give up on my GCSES and I already have. At this point my future is just not there- I'm not planning on dying but whenever people ask where I see myself in 20 years I just want to breakdown or slap them or something- isn't it obvious that I don't care anymore- I cant see myself in the next 20 minutes never mind 20 years. Its just school is so pointless to me, I don't learn anything, I just sit there, get frustrated that its too loud, the teachers are shit and I cant focus in the lesson, almost cry then sit around my friends at lunch, almost crying again because its too loud yet again, and then I just leave when ever they start eating because food makes me uncomfortable and God forbid I even think about eating in front of others.

When ever I try to vent to my friends, I know exactly what they'll say- one will just be like 'just do it, it'll get better, man up and get on with it' and another will just be like 'oof same'. They disregard my problems so much and I love them so much, it hurts, but it also hurts when they just ignore the fact that every day I will get really upset over something really dumb.

Life just seems pointless- I spent my whole life reading fantasy and watching anime, that this life just seems so boring and there is no point- everyone says the point of life is to do what makes you happy, but what if nothing does? What do you do then? We are all going to die anyway and the chance of you doing something amazing and being remembered is so small, its just not going to happen- in two generations time, you'll be forgotten- you wont live on in others memory because the people who would remember you will be dead as well, to put it bluntly.

I'm not looking for words of advice, or people to tell me to 'find the light in the darkness' or 'embrace your inner strength' I've tried, and its not there- it was never there to begin with. If you think I'm some sort of edgy teen looking for attention then fine think that, I just needed to vent somewhere where I could be uninterrupted and just be able to just put some of my issues into the world for who ever to read.

sorry if this sounds rude, or snappy, I'm just so frustrated and I really have given up on everything- I know this probably has a really harsh rude vibe, but I didn't mean it to , it just kind of happened . This is also kinda long so sorry about that :("
1553,Why do I cry and breathe heavily when I wake up from a dream?,"I haven’t had this happen to me for awhile, but it’s been happening now. It doesn’t happen every single day, but when it does happen, I feel so scared. I’m 16 now and I think it started when I was like 15. It might be normal I don’t know, but I remember that I’d have some kind of nightmare or dream.. and I would wake up (depending on the dream) and breathe heavily and cry, sometimes I know it’s because of something sad that happened in my dream. But I would feel so sad and scared of what’s around me. Even if I have good dreams, I once had a time when I laughed in my sleep.. which is strange. But the ones that occur the most is waking up crying and breathing heavily, I really hate this feeling and I’m not sure .. I don’t know if it’s night terrors or some kind of sleeping disorder, but I hope it is something I can get treated for. 
- I cry during and after I wake up
- I breathe heavily 
- hard to breathe for awhile 
- heart races
- feeling hopeless and sad after waking up 
- My chest and heart feel weird after (not in pain), so I usually just take deep breaths to feel better 
- does not happen everyday, only sometimes but I thought I got over it until it happened to me today again 
- I don’t know if it’s normal nightmares or not, it just feels like it’s not a regular nightmare I used to have because now I’m actually having like anxiety from it when I never had it before .. 
- traumatic things did happen to me recently, but I never was stuck on it for a long time.. but now I’m getting this type of sleep and stuff, so I’m not sure why"
1554,I tried,"Ive given up. 

Thats basically all.."
1555,"My friend (15M) is suffering from severe depression, he cuts a lot, he ended up in a hospital and his parents couldn’t care less.","I’m sure my friend has clinical depression, he’s only 15 and he cuts a lot, recently a girl rejected him and that just kicked him down lower. He recently ended up in a hospital due to the cuts, he was there overnight and even after all that, his evil parents don’t give a duck about his mental health. They joke about my friend with relatives and neighbors. 

I come from India and the stigma surrounding mental health problems is just inhumane. Indians my age have full exposure to western movies and tv shows, we see western kids get therapy and medication for any mental illness but that’s all we can do, we can only watch others get help and it sucks so much because the kids in India know what is wrong with them, they know if they have Bipolar disorder/ADHD/OCD etc, we are fully aware of any symptoms we have but we can do nothing about it.

There has been a massive growth in people studying to be psychiatrists but we still have to wait a minimum of 10 years for psychiatric help to be normalised and acceptable.

I don’t know how to help my friend, I don’t even think I am equipped, me and my friends are trying to gather some money to get him into some online therapy session but we dont know if it’s legit and 1-2 sessions aren’t going to cure his depression.

Many Brown parents don’t even deserve to have kids istg but the coming generation will be so much better but I need some help right now. I try to help my friend as much as I can, when I found out he got admitted to a hospital, I just fucking lost it and the next day I had a test, I just couldn’t write it well, my marks on that exam dropped by 70%. Are there any resources which provide free, legit therapy to Indian kids? How do I help him? Any advice?"
1556,I dont know how to deal with myself,"Lately ive gotten inspired and grown more as a person, found new hobbies and interests, and a gotten a boost in productivity during the last month of 2020 and still on that journey. But lately i also been experiencing weekly emotional releases or a mild emotional breakdown. Im always the hold in your emotions type of guy so that may explain it? I do have emotional scars that still bother me today but i almost never talk about it to anyone. Im currently in 11th grade and its been pretty stressful about colleges and the future. Before i took the action to better myself, i was not motivated to do anything and i would watch youtube 24/7 and do homework last minute. Still today im still struggling with motivation and im just not very happy with the situation im in as there are alot of stressful factors in my life. Im not sure if what im experiencing is the covid blues, but i just want to know how to deal with what im experiencing. Im still struggling with motivation and im so stressed with school, college and my life outside school. i just need some help or advice man."
1557,How one person can save your life.,"It all started when we met in work in 2015. I was a bit of an idiot to say the least. My whole life was work, work work. So much that I had moved from my original store to the flagship store for the company that I worked for. I was obsessed with the job, inside and out. So much so that I didn't really have a life outside of work. That was until my future wife started working there. 

Oh my goodness, words can't describe how she lit up the room every time she entered it. She was warned of me and my ""over the top passionate"" ways, so much that she was nervous around me. Being my usual arrogant self, I thought nothing of it, but just a personality trait. Then fate happened, I was asked to train her on the standards of the company, in a test to see if I was worthy of a promotion. ""At last, progression!"" I thought, I was eager to get started. So we started working together and at first it was nothing but professional, with the usual ""clock in, train, logging and clocking out."" routine. That's at least until I noticed the happiness disappear whenever she had left. So the next day, I asked her if she wanted to go for a drink after work. She said yes!

There we were, an arrogant know it all and a nervous, beautiful woman on, at least what I thought, a date. So things were going extremely well and the sparks were flying through me like I'd never felt before. As time went on, we met up more and more, mainly for a few drinks after work to discuss our day. When we were getting to know each other we both discovered that we lived quite far from work, with her mother living on the other side of town and I was living in a whole different area. We discussed it and agreed that it would be beneficial if we moved in together, as she was paying towards rent at home anyway and I was paying my usual living costs and travel expenses, That's when she had asked if she could come to mine. Which I said wasn't an issue to me, except it was. 

My life wasn't all I was making it out to be, I was depressed. I thought that if I had my own place, I'd be classed as an adult and be seen as somewhat ""cool"". At first, my family come to see me, helped me set everything up, everything was going really well, as a matter of fact, I loved it! but then reality happened. Truth is, I was classed as an adult but not in a cool way, a stressful, dark way. I got everything I'd wanted, a pool table, big tv, PS3, dartboard, leather chair, Gibson guitar (that I couldn't even play, but I told myself I was going to learn one day), etc. but the world is a dark place when no one cares, or wants to come see you. Or when you simply don't have the time to enjoy it. That's until work took over, I was wanted, I was needed. I was something again. At least that's how I felt. I was doing 6/7 days a week, I thought I was doing fine. A bit tired but every adult is, right? I shrugged it off and kept going. Knocked back more cigarettes, caffeine and alcohol than I did food and water. I was spending more money on takeaways as I was on cooking my own food and I didn't know anything at all about recycling at this point so my flat was a bit of a dump. I was worn out, skin was ageing, so much that she admits she thought I was in my 30's when we met, I was only 23! That's only half the story, big news hit later on.

Back to the part you all want to hear about.  This was the moment that she wanted to come and see my place as I stupidly bragged about it and about giving her the ""Grand tour"". So we did, as I wanted to impress her. I asked her to wait outside, She agreed. All whilst I was panicking, grabbing bin bags and filling them up with rubbish, bottles, takeaway boxes, wiping all the sides in the kitchen, bathroom, leather chair and hoovering, then shoving everything into the bedroom. All in the space of what I thought was only 10 minutes. It was more like 45. I was very lucky at the fact she waited. Regardless of the fact I sprayed almost a full bottle of air freshener, she could still smell the rubbish. I will never understand how, but she looked right passed it. Scared for my life and anxiety through the roof, we put on music and just like that, the neighbours didn't even complain as my mind repeatedly told me they would throughout my time living there. Then I asked if she'd played pool before, she hadn't so I was teaching her, even though every time we pot the ball, it went through the holes in the pockets and hit the floor, but I didn't care as there will still no more complaints. I loved every second of it. Shown her around, which was just the bathroom and kitchen as the bedroom was off limits and then I made sure she was okay in getting home. IT FELT PERFECT. We never looked back, we moved in together. Just as friends though (don't blame her).

Living together was difficult at first, debates happened but the good times outweighed the bad. I loved it. Felt alive again. We watched movies, went got drinks in, gossiped about people at work. You know, the usual. I felt in love, so as any man would, I asked her out. She said no. I asked why and she told me she wasn't ready, which in other words to me meant ""impress her more."" 

So that's what I tried to do. Asking what her favourite meal was, she replied that she'd never had salt and pepper chicken but had heard good things. So the little cocky boy inside of me thought, ""say no more, fam"" and made what I thought was salt and pepper chicken. It absolutely wasn't. it was a chicken breast, burnt on the outside and raw in the middle which I seasoned with  salt and pepper. Absolutely vile and I'm lucky she checked that it was cooked before having it. That wasn't how she saved my life though! More on that later. 

To this day I regret making that salt and pepper chicken, which I now know how to properly make by the way, but I only regret it for the fact that I've never lived it down. She said it was the moment she fell in love with me, but she still wasn't ready to say yes, even though I asked her a second time.

Work got stressful but sparks were still flying, I still looked worn down and spots were flaring up on my face alongside bloodshot eyes, so we decided let's go and take a break! We had already discussed our love for Blackpool so we thought why not book a hotel? We packed our bags and went. We had the time of our life, that's in her words anyway. She still talks about all the things we had done on that trip, and takes me to all the spots that we visited and where I asked her out and she finally said yes. I love hearing those stories. We got pictures, tokens from the arcades, prizes and she has her memories. I didn't remember a thing. 

That's when headaches were starting for me. I was getting more angry and aggressive, we argued more but I never, ever, lay a finger on her, as I still told her I loved her every day and she could see that I was stressed. Mainly because of what I told her, was ""work issues"". Then one night we argued over something silly, so silly that she can't even remember what it was, all she remembers is that she didn't say she loved me that night and she really regrets that. We went to bed in a mood, facing opposite directions. That's when she felt a hit on her back and that was the final straw, ""That's it."" she said and went to get up, only to see me foaming from the mouth and shaking, I was having a seizure. So she had rang an ambulance, followed all the instructions until they got there. The ambulance crew took over and saved me from swallowing my tongue. She thought she'd lost me, but in fact, she saved me. 

It took them a few scans and a year discussing the matter before they had diagnosed me with a brain tumour and started to medicate me. I had forgotten everything. All our relationship was gone, some memories have come back with the help of pictures she had taken, one of them is attached with more to follow. 

After this, I quit my job. She supported me in doing so, I had enough of being treated the way I was by them. She made sure I was drinking and eating properly and attended every appointment with me until I felt comfortable in doing so myself. We discussed ambitions and goals again and I became a better person, someone who I wanted to be. I quit smoking and drinking and went on to water and jogging. I felt human again. One of our goals was to become parents as we always wanted a child. 

After this discussion I decided to approach my doctor and ask what the chances were of conceiving, I was told the medication wouldn't affect it. Perfect! That was at least on my end of course. Her family was ridden with Polycystic ovaries syndrome, which can ultimately lead to not being able to have babies, it broke our hearts. We didn't give up on each other though, I owed her everything. 

We decided to save for a house instead, moved out of the flat and in with my mum. I got a full time job and we started saving as much as we could. Started window shopping for our future together and thats when I noticed she had gone in the jewellery shop looking at a ring and cried when she seen one, I made note. I needed it. So without further thought I got a bigger contract and work and took out finance to get the ring so she didn't notice the big transaction going out. 

Meanwhile, she went on the keto diet to lose weight and I hit the gym as much as I could to improve my sperm count. We tried and tried, over and over. Nothing. One day I come home from the gym and she was crying, fearing the worst. She told me to move on with my life as she couldn't give me what I wanted. That's when I proposed, I pulled out the ring that she had been telling me about, and I asked her to marry me, she said ""Yes, but what about having kids?"" I said ""I don't need kids if I've got you and we will find a way anyway, I promise."" We hugged, kissed and told each other we loved each other, we have done every day since that night we argued. 

Life went on and events happened, we carried on going to the gym and sticking to our diets and then one day she had come to my work, I was surprised but very happy to see her smiling, curious as to why. She's never been good at hiding emotions. That's when she shown me a pregnancy test. We were pregnant! It worked! I had to immediately take a break in work to process it, but we were having a baby!

We immediately found our own place, which was considerably far from where my mum lived, due to it being a safe area and didn't care about the savings anymore. We had got all the baby clothes and essentials that we needed with help from family too.

The usual cravings, scares, worries and shocks happened throughout the pregnancy, thinking the worst but imagining the best. We found out we were having a little girl, but that she was going to be a big baby. So we took the midwives advice and monitored everything. Took extra precautions throughout the pregnancy.

As the days went on, they got harder. Then what seemed like a normal day in work, turned out to be the day she went into labour. I rushed out with happiness, excited, scared, everything. Before I knew it, we were in the delivery room.  This was it, no going back, not that we would. Our lives were never going to be the same again. Hers certainly wasn't. Complications happened, nothing life threatening, thank goodness! She had been so brave, had to have an epidural and was on the gas and air. That's when the midwives and doctors announced that she needed to start pushing. So she did, the baby still wasn't coming, then we noticed the head, so I was telling her how great she was doing, then the midwife said that she baby was too big and they had to make a cut to ensure there wasn't a tear. So we agreed and she made the cut, but the tear still happened on the opposite side. then the baby come straight out, our girl! My princess! Only for blood and water to follow, which they said was normal. We did it! We thought. That was until 5 litres of blood eventually followed. She was on the drip, struggling to walk and had to go through physical therapy to show her how to again whilst I looked after our girl and helped with the physical therapy also. 8 days later and we're back at home and looking after our little girl. 

We had our first Christmas, New Years and then started her baby classes, going swimming, doing everything she loved and that's when the pandemic happened. She was now considered high risk so couldn't leave the house. All her hobbies, baby classes, seeing family and everything all had to stop. Then we had the shock of having another baby, which we didn't even think would be possible! So we sworn that after the pandemic we will make sure we find a bigger place to live close to my family again. We managed it, in the space of a few months we had an online viewing and got our house sorted. Everything was going well with the pregnancy, and thankfully still is. The house is amazing but I still can't help but wonder what would have happened if I never met her, would I still be here? Would I be dead? Would I have a beautiful little girl and another little girl on the way? She saved me.

She helped me more than just saving my life, she shaped my future. She helped me quit my job, get out of the dark place I was in and helped me get back on track, taught me practically everything that I know about cooking, which would have been hard and helped me become a father. I owe her more than I can give at the moment and I can't help but think that it's time that I give her everything she wanted and more.

She talks to me everyday about how she wants to lose her weight naturally and how scared she is of her life expectancy being lowered by the events that have occurred. I want to make sure she achieves her goals and ambitions too and give her the time off she deserves, away from the babies and for her to go and live her best life. 

With times being hard it's going to prove difficult but I've got a job lined up with the NHS which will be starting as soon as the training can go ahead and I'm going to pick as many hours as I can at work to make sure I can fund it. 

Sticking in there and powering through genuinely saved my life and made me complete, if it can happen to me then it can happen to anyone.

Also, I changed her name to her/she throughout on purpose so it was anonymous."
1558,Mental health feedback,"I have not been diagnosed medically yet but I am sure that I am a sociopath. I know you guys might think I’m a piece of crap after this but I kind of want to get it off my chest. I had been in a really toxic relationship with a girl and I think she rubbed off on me. I began using females and my words correctly to get them to have sex with me. I would love when I could make a girl hooked on me and never leave me alone. I always wanted to have the upper hand on them and get them to do whatever I wanted, not illegally though. Even if this meant getting what I wanted. I would tell a girl I’ll take her out if we have sex. We have sex then I would completely ghost her. The cycle would continue until I got older and just stop trusting females when I thought I had found the right one and she ghosted me. Karma’s a B huh? I shut out all help because I don’t want it and I will fight my mental health that I’m pretty sure has worsened over time due to tragic events unfolding one after another. I began smoking weed heavily to depend on my happiness and having to not caring about anything attitude. Now I don’t really have love for anyone and I have accepted the fact that I may die alone and am completely ok with it."
1559,Why do the smallest things ruin my mood,"Idk if this deserves to be here, I don’t want to seem pathetic. But I had a very productive morning today, I worked out for the first time in months, ate a healthy breakfast, and got some school work done. Now that’s really rare for me. And then I took a nap and set an alarm for 30 min and ended up sleeping for 3 hours on accident. I’m really stressed now all of a sudden, and feel like I wasted time. I went and self harmed for some reason and now I wanna go back to bed. I realize that maybe naps make me cranky I’m not sure. But this has happened over other things like someone pissing me off for the dumbest reasons."
1560,First Look At My Website,"Hey guys! 

Over the past few days, I have been working tirelessly on my website. It has been stressful at times, but I know feel comfortable enough with it to share it with you all. I have decided to share it as it’s in early (and I can’t stress this enough) *early* stage of development. But, I would *LOVE* to hear some recommendations, things to add/delete and feedback. It would mean the world to me! 

The link to the website is: **violin-mackerel-48l2.squarespace. com** (there isn’t a gap between “. and com”, if I used the whole link in this post, it would be deleted).

1561,I feel numb and other stuff,"Disclaimer: I have never been diagnosed with anything. I have never talked to a health professional about anything mental health related and I don't actually talk to anyone in my life about this. Also english isn't my first language.

I feel really numb and I can't remember a time it was different. I also just feel super disconnected. There is just emptiness in my chest?? Sorry if this doesn't make sense, I have never actually put any of this into words. I don't really care about anything, I think it's because I barely feel real sometimes. I never cry about things that happen to me. I'll bawl my eyes out at movies and very rarely when I'm drunk but I broke up with my bf of 4 years and not a tear, no pain, nothing. Last time I cried sober was when I had a mental breakdown due to not finishing my thesis. Only sober, not movie related cry in the idk past 3 years maybe? 

I feel like I'm distracting myself all the time. I'm constantly on my phone or listening to audiobooks/ podcasts, watching a series or whatever because everytime it's silent or I'm left alone with my thoughts my head starts spinning. I am constantly battling my own thoughts and it's so exhausting. I always believed I am just lazy but I recently started to realise that maybe I'm just exhausted from convincing myself to think normal things. It's like I'll just suddenly start obsessing over something/someone or catastrophize like hell and it takes all of my energy to keep thinking linear and stay realistic and not get caught up too much. 

Thanks to anyone who made it this far. I am planning to find a therapist btw but I can barely muster the energy to do my basic life tasks right now and I honestly don't know how to verbalise any of this. It's been spinning in my head forever but I never said any of it out loud because I have kind of a hard time opening up and being vulnerable."
1562,what is the point of asking for advice if i can't control my actions?,"i keep thinking that other people can understand what i'm going through and help me somehow. why can't i accept that there's no human being who can help me?

and it's not like i intend to stop asking strangers on the internet for advice,but why?what is happening with me?

it would be much easier to have someone irl to vent to, maybe that could push them to make some decisions for me,but that won't happen unless i show in a clear and extreme way that i'm in danger.

i'm like a mute prophet,i know i'm doomed but can't communicate that to anyone close to me."
1563,Do I have OCD or other mental health disorder?,"Hello, I hope I can ask questions like this in this subreddit. I really don't have the resources to go to a professional for a diagnosis, but I'll certainly consider it once my question is cleared.

Anyway for a bit of a background, I'm M (22) and I've been suffering from symptoms for many years now. I have taken many OCD tests online and they are all affirmative. I'll list down some of the symptoms I'm experiencing, and I wonder if they are all indicative of OCD.

- When adjusting volumes, I always pick first the lower and higher value every time. (If I want the volume to be 20, I do it like 19 &gt; 20 &gt; 21 &gt; 20). Same for Facebook reacts, I always have to hover every icons before picking my desired react
- I always have these unwanted and often inappropriate thoughts, especially when I'm with people I shouldn't have those thoughts about. They involve sexual and violent thoughts.
- Oftentimes I think that I should do something to prevent bad things from happening, like adjusting or touching something. Also, whenever I travel I always have to look at the road ahead because otherwise I think we will be involved in an accident.
- I noticed that I have tendencies to buy random things, even though I don't really use them. But I can't let go of them.
- I also have a particular phrase I always repeat whenever I'm praying for something. 

There are just some that I can remember. Thank you for understanding!"
1564,Unhappy and don't know why,I am currently sitting on the kitchen tiles writing this. I feel so unhappy and I don't know why. Nothing makes me happy. I am having trouble even writing this post because I don't know how to write how I feel. I just know that I am unhappy and I don't know why. I feel like I am suffocating from lack of air and drowning. I want so bad to scream out loud but I don't want to upset the neighbours.
1565,How do I begin?,"I have some obvious signs of mental instability, a fucked up childhood, a history of substance abuse issues, depression, and people who actually depend on me. 

I don't know how to go about getting help or the name of the type of doctor I should begin with. 

When I told my doctor about how I am feeling they've given me :

Lithium Bicarbonate- fuck this shit, it put me in a god damn cloud.  I don't really remember anything but quit taking it after I got hit riding my bike. 

Welbutrin / bupropion - this was actually a wonder drug for like 3 years, I was able to quit smoking, got really healthy, but something happened and I got stressed at work, bought a pack of cigarettes, and began spiralling. I swear to god this medicine made me want to do illegal drugs though. I had cravings for amphetamines from this. 

Lamotrigine- Something I was told to take with the Welbutrin, I took it for three months before discontinuing. 

Sertraline - this made me not care what happened. It was good and all, but I lost all motivation to do anything and gained 15 pounds. 

Also, I suffered some child abuse and was involved in a wreck that fucked my face up and left me in a two-month coma due to some head trauma when I was 7.  

I haven't taken any medicine for two months, I haven't used any drugs in the same two months (except weed), and I feel okay I guess, I am just an asshole. 

I think I need to talk to a therapist, but how do I go about choosing one? Obviously, one my insurance covers."
1566,Feelings of Nervousness,"I am seeking some guidance, because our dear old friend Google has not helped me at all. 

Recently I have been having more and more moments of nervousness without any logical cause. It just happens. I get that nervous pit in my stomach. However there are no other symptoms, no other signs of generalised anxiety, no overthinking, etc. It almost feels like a medical symptom, like how you can have a headache or feel nausea. The only thing I can think of is just the general state of the world with COVID. 

Is there anyone with a clue as to what this might be? Are there versions of anxiety disorders, where it's just nervousness? Does anyone know of any physical medical ailments that cause just nervousness. 

I understand there isn't a lot of info here, so I am happy to answer any questions. I just don't know what would be relevant."
1567,A time you’ve been betrayed bc of your mental health?,"TW: mentions of suicide/depression
Last year August was the peak of my depression and my cousin was really going thru it too. Everyone in my household including a few of my family in Australia only knew of my attempts, no one else. Basically my cousins family (on her mums side) blamed me and said that I had influenced her and she’s the way she is now bc of me. Cool, great, all good, didn’t bother me whatsoever. But what REALLY hurt and took a toll on me was when a close family member had told them that I had attempted earlier that year. Basically what happened after that is that they started saying, and I quote, “yes this is exactly why my daughters this way! Her cousins insane and tries to khs whenever she gets the chance!” And “she should’ve taken more.” And it really hurt me bc I knew I would’ve gotten judged for attempting to take my own life. But what hurt me more was the people who I considered close family members telling their friends and family who I didn’t consider close. It hurt bc I know how seriously New Zealand handles mental health, and many people here don’t take it seriously at all. It hurt me bc I thought I could trust them with a chapter in my life where I felt so vulnerable and weak. I even felt embarrassed after surviving. They used my depression and attempts against me, and I don’t think I could ever forgive them after what they did to me"
1568,I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD and I’m afraid to tell my husband the extent of my problems,"I should preface this by saying I KNOW I need to talk to my husband, and I will. I’m scared. He senses these things are wrong, but he doesn’t know the extent of how wrong.

I’m 25 and my husband is 29. We’ve been married a year. Over the last year, I’ve struggled emotionally and mentally and am recently at a breaking point. I do believe I have undiagnosed ADHD. I have always struggled with sticking to tasks, remembering important details, focusing and being attentive, and it has worsened GREATLY in the past few years. My husband will be talking to me, and I at some point will zone out. Not intentionally, and often he will realize my eyes are glazed over and pull me back. He gets frustrated when he realizes I’ve heard nothing he’s said. He has and seeks regular treatment for ADHD, so he’s seen the signs in me and was the first person to mention what he thinks. 

Aside from how frustrating it is that I cannot focus, I also have a hard time remembering things. The other day I walked into the kitchen to make my son a bottle, I saw the dog had to go outside so I let him out, then I had to go feed the cats, then go grab laundry, then go to the bathroom, and by the time I got back to the kitchen, I stood there trying to remember what I was doing there. I let the dog back in and went and sat next to my son. After a while he started getting fussy, and that’s when I realized I was trying to make him a bottle. This happens daily, several times a day, at home, at work, with family, with friends, with colleagues and supervisors. I’m forgetful and I can’t pay enough attention to their directions or important details. 

But the worst of it is, I get really stressed about deadlines, and I tend to push them out of my mind until it’s either cutting it close or it’s too late. In high school, I loved learning and I don’t think I’m unintelligent. I’ve been told that I am quite intelligent and well spoken. Yet I could only maintain a D average, not because I didn’t grasp concepts, but because I couldn’t focus on work and I bounced between classes without finishing anything (I was homeschooled, but my parents weren’t involved) and turned all assignments in late, which meant I only got 50% credit, sometimes less than that. I graduated a D average student... now, I’ve discovered recently that a little bit of medical debt has gone to collections. Not thousands and thousands, but some. When the bills would come, I’d remind myself to start paying them, and then I would forget and push it out of mind, until it gets to be too late. I’m scrambling now to make sure no more goes, but we’re already struggling financially. I feel embarrassed, and I feel like he’s gonna be so mad that I’ve let this happen. And to make it worse, now that we have all this medical debt we’re already struggling to pay off, I don’t know if I’ll be able to see a psychiatrist to help figure this all out. My husband and I share all of our finances, we have the same bank account, and I know I can’t keep this from him. But I am so ashamed of myself. 

Along with all of this I struggle heavily with depression and anxiety and an eating disorder, and this is just making all of it worse. The state of the world recently doesn’t help, and I feel it all collapsing in on me. At times I have trouble breathing solely because I have all of this rushing at me and I don’t know how to manage it all.

Sorry for the long post. This is the first time I’ve gotten all of this out."
1569,How has the whole sudden surge about manifestation and stuff impacted your mental health?,"I'm 17(F). I have diagnosed depression, anxiety and few other issues. I have been battling myself from the time I was a small girl. 

This sudden popularity over manifestation and subliminals has made me more depressed than feel better. Lot of people just ask me to stay positive and invalidate my feelings. It's so easy to just ask people to love themselves these days and in the name of understanding the psychology or feelings of the individual suffering, they just ask them to ""change their lifestyle"". Whoever had a glowup during quarantine is freaking amazing! This might not even be related to this post's topic but I'm curious."

1572,Does anyone else find themselves overeating a lot more when they have to stay at home almost all of the time due to lockdown?,"I think people who struggle with overeating might find that this problem only gets worse when you’ve got to stay home and you’re constantly worried whether this cycle of lockdowns will ever be over, so you go and try to suppress this feeling of fear and uncertainty by eating more than your body actually requires. 

I’m a Year 13 student who lives in England, and we’re now in the third lockdown which started less than a week ago, but for the past few days I just couldn’t get myself to do any school work, I have completely stopped taking care of myself, and food has been the only thing that could distract me from having to deal with the fact that it’s now 2021, and we’re in an even worse position than we were in March 2020, and no one knows whether and when this is going to come to a stop. I thought I would take this lockdown better than the first one, but it’s only got harder for me, and stuffing myself with food has almost become my escape from reality. I can only hope to find some sense of purpose in the next couple of months, but for now I just feel really lost. 

Wish anyone who might feel this way to find a reason to get out of bed every single day soon, even if it’s the tiniest or silliest thing ever. And remember - you’re not alone and deep down I know that it’s all gonna get better one day as long as we’re there for each other ❤️"
1573,Would you pay for a service where you get to talk to trained professionals (not psychologists/therapists) without revealing your identities?,"What if there was a service where people would interact with people on the other side of the phone anonymously? The trained professional would be there to listen to you whatever want to share/vent and be there for you. So many of us want to share things that we can't/won't with the people we know.

What do you all think about?"

1575,Literal numbness as a side effect of stress?,"Hi all this is kind of a weird one I'm just hoping to find someone out there who has experienced a similar thing and can tell me it will go away.

In brief, after a traumatic time (5 days in hospital with no visitors after having a baby) all my skin including the inside of my mouth went numb, I could still feel temperature, pain and taste but little to no touch sensation. A doctor assessed me while I was still in hospital and did bloods but said there's nothing physically wrong and it was caused by stress and sleep deprivation. I had some other issues as well but had a few sessions with a therapist for PPA and with time I'm feeling much better mentally now and the other problems are gone but the numbness has never completely gone away 4 months later.

Some days I don't really notice, it's become my new normal to have a reduced touch sensation and I only realise it's still going on because someone asks about it, but other days it's more severe and it does bother me a bit."
1576,Regularly challenging my thoughts is exhausting. That's why I try to practice mindfulness too.,"I have just come to terms after living for 30 years that I have an anxious and depressive personality. Most of the time, I have been just accepting my thoughts as they are and eventually subconsciously convinced myself that they are true. Now I have been roughly practicing CBT and found myself challenging my irrational thoughts but it can be exhausting really. That's why I think being in the moment really helps me with CBT. Being mindful is harder than challenging though. But I will get there eventually."
1577,Rage against entitlement,"I don't know where to begin to share the anger... the rage I feel against the entitled fucks that stormed the Capitol yesterday.  It's not even my Country but I can't help but feel pure rage and hate against these people, against the President, against the Senators (Hawley, Cruz) that supported this behaviour.  I scare myself when I think about what I would do if I came across these people which makes me no better than them.  I become obsessed, like my dog with a toy, browsing sites, watching CNN and the rage returns with every image of the scum walking through the halls of the Capitol, most of which who probably have no idea what they are doing there... it's just cool.  

What fuels my rage is the fact that I feel a need to be heard by these people and enrage them the same way they do to me every time I see the images on the TV but I know I can't do this...  I have no way to hurt them.

The need to implement the 25th amendment seems obvious, if nothing else, to send a message to the President that he can not get away with this.

I find putting my feelings into words very difficult and I am far from eloquent when doing so.  I see tweets and posts from people that do an amazing job at conveying their wishes of what would happen to some of these people in a very well worded way and I wish I could do the same.

Anyways, thanks for reading and just typing this out helps... for now.

For those living in America that are as hurt about what happened yesterday...  I am sorry this has happened to you. I hope things begin to get better in 2 weeks and I really hope justice is served to the terrorists and maybe even more importantly, the terrorists that are part of the Gov't that allowed and encouraged this to happen.

Thanks."
1578,Watched the movie Wolfwalkers now I'm completely obsessed and deeply depressed about living in this world.,I suffer from spouts of depression every now and then. I did see a therapist for it and that helped a lot. But i watched this movie and now all i want is to find a way to live in that world. I know this is not possible and that i shouldn't feel this way but all that dose is Trigger the depression. Im so confused im depressed that i cant live in a imaginary world? I feel like i am loosening my mind to feel like this. any advice will be appreciated.
1579,"Should I feel bad about thinking about giving a gift to a close friend, instead of spending it on myself?","I’ve been working in a pet shop recently and have been wanting to get my friend a gift for her pets for the past few weeks. It’s a couple of dollars, but my supervisor ended up saying that I could have it for free if I wanted to gift it. 

I accidentally mentioned this free-gift thing with my mum while explaining that my workplace is full of great people (at the same time justifying why I’m thinking of staying in this job that helps with my depression by giving my work meaning instead of making it worse, rather than finding a job that pays $1-2 bucks more per hour). 

I understand that I’ve been relying on my family a bit with trying to pay for my therapy sessions (a private therapist that they’ve recommended for me to continue seeing even though I worry about cost), and paying for medication ($250 per month). I still pay for them myself and have been for months, it’s just that recently with going from a full-time job to being unemployed (due to severe depression), to then easing nurse of back into a part-time job that would be suitable to still go to once I started schooling, my family members each offer to pay one or two sessions for me every now and then because they know I’m not working a full-time job while the rest of them are (with generous wages). That said, I recently did increase my working days to 4 times a week instead of the usual 1 (it’s been an overwhelming start so far, but I’m adjusting slowly but surely), which is already kinda one day short of a full-time job. So I do understand why my family would get a bit jarred with the idea of me giving a gift when I could’ve saved the extra few dollars (worth 2 working hours) for myself. In my head, I was thinking that since I started working a ton of extra hours, it would’ve been ok to spend a small portion of the additional pay on a gift. 

I generally give a small number of gifts (I give 1-2 per year, to maybe 2-3 close friends, and they’re not pricey gifts at all — in fact they spend more on me than I do on them) because I feel a bit better whenever a gift makes someone I love happy / happier. I get meaning in my life from making other people happy, or at least feel safe and loved and appreciated. 

Is it wrong to want to give gifts to loved ones occasionally? And is it selfish of me to feel like my mum focused too much on the fact that I felt like giving a close friend (whom she knows and loves too) a small &amp; affordable gift, rather than the point that I was trying to bring across — that my supervisor kindly gave it to me for free (I didn’t spend any money, but my mum was upset that I was willing to in the first place)? 

I had that conversation with the hopes of trying to share the good, kind gesture of my boss.And I left that conversation feeling like a useless person that can’t choose the right job / takes advantage of my family like an ATM / doesn’t bother to pay for my own treatment / can’t be bothered to save up / always makes the wrong and insensible decision. 

Maybe I’m the one in the wrong, and I’m truly making irresponsible decisions. I feel like perhaps I shouldn’t have brought it up in conversation and should have caught myself before letting it slip. This day hasn’t been going well (lots of crying), and it ended with me feeling bad about 3 topics instead of just the 1 topic that I’d been feeling bad about. 

(I’m okay to hear conflicting POVs that side with “yeah you should’ve saved for yourself, YTA this time around”, but I’d appreciate it so much if you could please be kind and word it constructively; i’m not in the best headspace to deal with unkind / bluntly negative comments resiliently for now. TIA!)"
1580,Has anyone else become obsessed with an insecurity so much so you can’t stop thinking about it and it starts causing destructive behavior? Or anyone know how I can stop thinking about this all the time?,"I look young for my age, I’m 28, I would say I look early 20s, others might say I look like a teen, but regardless, I look young. 

It has always bothered me when people have commented on this, but the comments really started ramping up after I turned 21. 

Around that time, it started to become an obsession. I started thinking about it nonstop and it continues to this day. 

It started by ruminating over all the times people have mentioned I look young. It then becomes these angry thoughts of me getting mad at the people in those scenarios and saying something mean back. I’ll create future scenarios in my head where people comment on it. I obsess over what I see in the mirror, I will contort my face in ways to see if some change will make me look older, then start researching and debating plastic surgery, i start trying to lose weight because I think it’ll make my face look more gaunt, I almost never will leave the house without make up on, if I’m buying alcohol or am going to a bar, I make sure I look very put together and go into a panic mode until after I’ve been IDed, because I know that’s a scenario people have commented on it. When I’m meeting anyone new I try to come across as mature as possible and make sure I have make up on and if I don’t I’ll go into panic. 

Obviously, I want this to stop. I’m a functional person, but these thoughts are like constant white noise in the back of my mind that I’ve just gotten used to. However, I’ll go through phases where they make me act very destructive. It’s really painful to be self sabotaging all the time. 

I have brought this up to every therapist I’ve seen, and none of them have been able to figure out what tools could work. I meditate quite often but these thoughts persist. Some therapists have thought there may be some sort of trauma related to this but we haven’t been able to uncover anything. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar?? Maybe something related to a different insecurity? Does anyone have any idea how I can give my mind some peace??"

1585,I can’t stop overthinking right now.,"I feel so insecure, and I sometimes lack trust even to the person I love—as if they will eventually get tired of me, inevitably leaving. I feel insecure physically as well, where I’m currently not satisfied with my appearance, how physically attractive I am to my partner, how insecure I am for being a virgin while my partner is not, as well as feeling sorry for my health.

O can’t tell my parents cause we’re too fucking broke—extremely broke. I can’t afford therapy. I’m looking for free online therapy but I can’t seem to find any.

I have no one to talk to this present moment, and I thought maybe a subreddit existed where people just talk about mental health and vent.

1586,Would it be a bad idea to catch up with acquaintances/casual friends when having weird thoughts?,"I'm struggling a bit with stress, uni work, loneliness, weight gain, money problems...

Nothing major so far thankfully! But sometimes I do feel really bad and have ""weird"" thoughts.

Mostly it's stuff like "" It would be really easy for my friends to exclude me to include other people they like more now"" or ""my friends have a bettere relationship among themselves than they have with me..."", ""My close friends are moving on without me...""

I try to move on...

But today I thought that I should kill myself after my degree because I have nothing elese going on in my life and I don't want my life to be my job. I am mostly fine! I don't really plan to do it, I know it makes no sense, but thinking it is making me sad (which is better than nothing) and I'm having trouble focusing on other tasks.

It's been quiet some time since the last time suicide crossed my mind and I would like not to dwell on it.

I thought it would be nice when this stuff happens to catch up with some casual friends and see what's going on with their lives. We haven't met for months and I usually hate catching up via text so I don't know how they are doing.

I don't plan to open up to them and tell them my life problems of course! (But I would welcome the distraction :) )

I am a bit worried that since I would not be at my best I would come out a bit needy or otherwise uncomfortable.

Does anyone have any experience with this?

TLDR: sometimes I have intrusive sad thoughts and was thinking of lightly catching up with people when this happens in order to be distracted. I'm worried I would come out (involuntarily) as needy or weird"

1591,Roll call for sharply increased anxiety/depression over the last 24 hrs in America?,I am finding it impossible to look away or focus on anything else. I don’t even want to go outside because it feels too overwhelming.
1592,I’m treated like I’m crazy and I don’t even know why.,"I feel completely fine, I always have but for some reason people treat me like there’s something wrong with me, yet they won’t even tell me why.

I spent the later half my childhood (age 8 and above) going in and out of therapy even though I was clearly a healthy kid, nothing bad ever happened to me in my childhood that could have caused trauma. I couldn’t even ask my parents what I kept going into therapy for without them somehow dodging the question like they were hiding something. 

I’ve had 2 involuntary treatment orders over the last few years, 1 in 2015, 1 in 2018 and I almost got a 3rd one last October after the cops found me alone at a bus-stop at 5 in the morning (long story). They asked me a few questions, took me home and told me I’d get a phone call the following evening. One thing lead to another and I was set for another involuntary treatment order but nothing ever came of it. 

I’m just confused as hell because I swear I feel and act completely fine but I keep ending up being forced into treatment even though nobody will tell me what the hell my problem is. It’s so frustrating. Do I just lack self awareness and there really is something wrong with me that I just don’t notice?

Reddit is a last resort for me at this point. Can someone explain what the hell is going on?"
1593,Anxiety sucks,Anxiety is so hard! I’m doing exposure therapy now and it’s been rlly helpful but it’s so hard! Just needed to vent a little.
1594,"I [F,28] was bullied and a bully. The trauma of childhood bullying lingers."," 

Last night I could not go to sleep. I was reminded of an event in my life and suddenly all the hard memories I experienced came back to me in one night.

I had a really turbulent childhood. My parents were immigrants and always working. Their parenting style was always inconsistent. Some of the time they were always sleeping and watching TV to decompress. They worked hard to provide everything for our family, but I think I many ways they did not provide the emotional reassurance and dependability needed to be a secure child. If I was sad or upset, instead of speaking rationally with me, my dad would resort to the old way of Asian disciplining - the belt and slipper. Instead of having a two-way conversation about problems in my life, they would lecture me and tell me I was wrong all the time. They were also very protective of me. I was never allowed to play with other children at their homes, and the only times were during family parties or Christians meetings. They didn't socialize me properly. Didn't teach me about compassion or understanding.

When I first started elementary school, I really wanted to kids to like me. Desperately so but I started off on the wrong foot because I went around telling people that I wanted to do the ""Titanic"" with some boy. That incident followed me and earned me a ticket to Bullyland.

I spent most of elementary through high school years being bullied. So much of elementary school was trying to win friends over and prove myself to be cool enough to be popular. I went about it in the wrong ways. Just like the bullies who would verbally and emotionally attack me, I tried to get people to go against another girl in my grade. I would gossip about her and spread rumors about her in a failed attempted to gain power. I also tried to become friends with the tough girls in school, but in the end they became my tormentors.

By the eight grade, I had stopped all together. Something within me shifted and I became friends with the two most unpopular girls in my school. Primarily because I knew were they sweet and kind at the end of the day.

High school everything continued but my bullies expanded to more people. Bullies are really good at networking! They recap new people on your life in elementary and those new people jump in on the fun of trying to humiliate you.

My demeanor changed in high school. I kept my head down and remained silent throughout all of the bullying. I tried to pretend I didn't hear them when clearly I did and everyone else. Because of this lifestyle, I performed poorly as a student. I would go home, eat, and sleep immediately. I would just be in my room wanting to be alone all the time. I also had difficulty maintaining a healthy relationship with my two friends. I would find myself being a bully to one of them or try to put them against each other. We all stuck together though.

When it was senior year, another shifted happened. I knew the end of my high school days were coming to an end, so I was focusing on glowing up. I lost weight and started dressing how I wanted to dress. I also stood up to bullies in gym classes even though it involves cursing. Maybe in a way it was to show them that I didn't give a sh\*\* anymore.

Post High School, I was never bullied again. But the wounds left extreme social anxiety and the inability to maintain healthy relationships. It's taken so many years of my life to see how my childhood trauma has affected me in my adult life. Even though I can socialize 110% better than when I was younger and I can empathize and be there for others, I still struggle to maintain healthy friendships. I always find a flaw, get annoyed, resentful, and then the friendship loses its strength. I was very confrontational in my early 20s because of being taken advantage throughout my childhood. But now in my mid to late 20, I'm trying to relearn how to be confident and compassionate to myself and others. I always feel alone or not good enough or worthy enough, and it truly stems from my formative years. To this day, I'm always trying to find peace in my self-esteem."
1595,I'm starting to realize my dad might've sexually abused me,"(M23) I started going to therapy cause I needed help with dealing with my combat trauma. But my therapist kept saying that in order to deal with my shit now I have to work through my childhood issues first. I told him I only had a few childhood memories so we wouldn't have much to work with but instead of letting it go, he became so fixated on it and he kept pushing me to talk about it and try to remember things and to attempt to see all my memories from a different perspective. So at that point I was technically biased so now I'm not even sure if the memories that resurfaced are real or if he manipulated me into believing they are. 

But either way, I remember my dad being abusive. I remember how he'd beat me and gaslight me and manipulate me and punish me for things that weren't my fault. Like my mom's death. He blamed me for it my whole life. And I did have one or two memories that seemed a bit off but I never thought much of it. So now that I remember more, on one hand it makes sense. But mostly I just don't want it to be true and I still can't believe it. And every time I think about it I want to throw up. Or drunk myself to death. Nothing in my life was what I think it was and now my relationship is almost definitely over. Cause I cannot put my boyfriend into this situation where he'd have to deal with me. 

I just don't know what to do anymore cause so far therapy only seems to have made it all much worse. I'm sorry if this post is chaotic but I'm just really overwhelmed and panicking a bit."
1596,Feeling dumb and not concentrated,"So this is a a thing that has been happening to me since the first lockdown.
I deliberately waste my time doing absolutely nothing for an entire day, I watch stupid shit on YouTube, I watch movies and TV series and I just generally flush my time down the drain.
To elaborate on my personal situation a bit, I am 21 years old, I come from Czech Republic and at the age of 19, after I graduated high school I went to study in Denmark.
Here I live in one of the shittiest towns where literally nothing happens, ever.
People here are depressed, mediocre and overall boring.
I live at a dormitory with other students, after the lockdown, which I spent at home in Prague with my family doing absolutely nothing for days on end, I decided to move to a bigger, more expensive room so that I would feel more at home here and I also changed my study programme (I was in tourism management, now I'm in marketing). I got a government study grant meaning that my earnings have spiked and I also started exercising more.
This Christmas I went home for three weeks and because of the Corona I was locked home almost all the time. Now I'm back to bad eating habits and wasting the day as much as I can, I am looking forward to going to sleep every day to forget about my life and when I wake up I immediately start mindlessly scrolling through social media and I can just physically feel myself getting more stupid with each passing day.
I know that it's within my power to change it but I just feel like I'm doomed to fail at everything I do so I don't even bother trying.

I'm sorry if this post is so chaotic and inconsistent, I don't even know what it was I trying to express here, I'm just aware of how I'm self sabotaging myself but for some reason I can't stop it.

I'm confused and afraid."
1597,I’m having an abnormally hard time socializing,"I’ve been diagnosed with GAD, MDD, and dpdr. I’ve slowly drifted away from my friends over the past several years due to my mental health. Over quarantine it’s gotten really bad and I can barely call them friends anymore. 

For some reason I feel like I’m losing myself. I don’t feel like the same person on the outside at least. I still have the same thoughts that I would have had in the past so that hasn’t changed that much (besides memory loss, iq drop, and not having things or say). Anyways it feels like I’m a different person on the outside than I am on the inside. Does anyone else experience this? It has really made socializing hard for me because on the outside I act kind of obnoxiously and people don’t really like that. I think this originated when I was about 15. I got really really depressed and had no friends at the time and so I tried to change myself. I thought I wasn’t funny enough or something so I tried to act like some popular people in my school who were “crackheads” and it’s stuck with me ever since. Is this a thing? The other horrible part is that I never have anything to say which makes me come off as a really bland person. These two factors make it so difficult to make friends.

The other problem I have is that these two issues have fueled my social anxiety. I’m seriously horrified of having interactions with people outside of my family. I don’t like how I act so I avoid any situations that demand socialization. I’m 17 and am struggling with the idea of doing things like going to college and getting a job."
1598,Can mental health problems be purely genetic?,"I know that some people experience mental health issues due to life circumstances. 

Others, I have read, have the genes for it but they need some stressful life experience(s) before the mental health problem can manifest.

Is there another category of people that can lead a totally idyllic life but their genes just set them up for anxiety/depression and that's what they end up getting?"
1599,no longer desensitized,why did i go from being mostly desensitized to gore and generally disturbing stuff but after i had a week and a half long mental freak out even the slightest gore and violence ruins my life and makes my want to detach from my life and body and society
1600,Anxiety and ocd,"Hi so this might be really weird but I’ve had a lot of anxiety and I really need someone’s opinion
 In the last couple of days and I just need to get it off my chest
So I have ocd and I overthink a lot, and sometimes thoughts come up into my head which I try to not think about but it’s hard not to. 
 As well as I’m an extrema Germ Afobe and one thing I struggle with is my room, because it’s always clean but when I haven’t cleaned it I start overthinking and saying “I need to clean my room!” “Will the dust stain?” And etc as well as when I clean my room I CLEAN MY ROOM!  I have to make sure everything is put exactly we’re it was, and it has to look perfect so if I move my lamp to clean underneath it, and then when I put it back down and feel like it’s not where it was I start trying to put it we’re it was and can spend up to an hour doing so.
Also it gives me extreme anxiety thinking ab moving furniture or people coming in my room, and I remember a couple months ago I was sitting in my desk(which I rarely use because I don’t want it to get dirty) and when I got up I thought I moved my desk but I thought to myself “ theirs no way I could move it” and I tried to move it, to give myself reassurance that I couldn’t and when I did move it I moved it back but I started thinking “is it straight?” “Is it exactly we’re it was before?” And all that and that’s happened with my mirror and nightstand and I’ll obsess about it for a long time some days I’m like “it’s perfect” and others I’ll be like “does it look crocked?” 
Basically two nights ago my head bored made like a piping sound and I’m not sure if I’m making this up or if it really happened but I thought it made a sound and then my mattress made a sound when I went to sit on it (I got all new furniture three years ago by the way) so i was rlly confused and ofc started obsessing about that. Then I started looking at my bed and making sure it straight and I then started overthinking and going “is it?” And then I thought one side was longer than the other and I was making myself crazy, yesterday I asked and friend if it looked fine and she said it did but I was still overthinking and I haven’t really been in my room cause I’m getting anxiety and when I’m in my bed I don’t want to move because I don’t want something to happen.
I looked up on the web to see if this was normal and the web was saying “it could be an old mattress” but Ik it’s not but I’ve only had it for 3years and when we bought it was brand new and same with the headboard but they were saying “it might have lose nails” so I’m asking my dad to check it out but I have anxiety he will move it or do something to it. I would really appreciate someone tell me if it’s normal or not Ik this is weird but I just need to come down my nerves."
1601,I am sixteen and have been struggling with binge eating for close to twelve months. I am new here and seeking any advice.,"Hello. I am sixteen and have been having this problem with binge eating for close to twelve months now. I have been having massive binge eating episodes nearly every day for multiple months in a row and during these binges I will continue eating until I am nauseous and in physical pain. I will be in so much pain and have so much bloating that I will be practically unable to function or focus on doing assignments or studying. I have been fasting to try to compensate for all the excess binge calories and also because this is how long the bloating and nausea and stomach pain from the binge takes to dissipate. This usually ends up in another binge eating episode. Due to this I have gained more than twenty pounds over the previous two months and I am unhappy with my body image now. This binge eating is taking over my life. I am really wanting to have healthy eating patterns and be in good physical shape and begin exercising again but the binge eating seems to control everything I do. I am obsessing over bingeing and eating even when I am not bingeing. I will binge when my parents and siblings are sleeping so no one else sees me. During this coronavirus pandemic my school has also moved to remote learning which means I am spending the entire day alone and in my house where I can binge. Being home alone is a huge binge trigger for me.

Does anyone have any advice or tips for how to stop binge eating? I am wanting to begin exercising again but the binges leave me so physically uncomfortable and in pain that doing something such as running or strength exercises seems impossible. I know the only way I can accomplish exercising or being healthy or even functioning normally is to stop the bingeing."
1602,"Everything I hear it feels like it's sped up and also has a rhythm to it, my heart is beating a lot faster, when I breathe I feel like people think I'm hyperventilating. I don't know what this is and I need to know.",I don't know what subreddit I should've posted this on so I chose this one. I've been having this issue for a year now. In 6th grade it was a lot more common than I have it now. But I've been getting it for the past few days now (after a while) and I remembered I never knew what it was. It kinda scares me not knowing what it is. The only thing that makes sense is that it comes from me not sleeping. I mean I got it in 6th grade when I slept well too so it doesn't make sense. I also wasn't the most nervous person so I don't think it's that. I don't know what subreddit I should've posted this on so I chose this one.
1603,I'm remembering what life was like before depression and it's so strange,"I really lost myself to depression. For 4 years. Luckily i'm on some decent medication doing therapy now, and I keep having these random realisations like ""wow happiness is an actual feeling in it's own right! Its not just an absence of sadness, it's a feeling that makes my chest feel light!"". The most recent one was just now when I was messaging my friend and thought ""omg I used to have a personality, this is what my personality is! I remember!"" 

I hope it continues getting better."
1604,i told my parents how i’m feeling and they’ve just ignored it,"a few days ago i told my mum about how i was feeling in an email cos i couldn’t say it to her face. i obviously left out some details that revolve around her but even then i said some things that i hoped would mean that she would take me seriously. she acted like she cared for about 2 hours and has now kind of pushed it to the side. in just in the past hour i was called pathetic, a snowflake, told to snap out of it and to get a grip (this is from both my parents). i realise i’ve made them out to be bad people here but they’re not they’re just always stressed from work and it probably looks like i’m attention seeking (i have three older brothers as well who are all successful so no pressure there). 

i just really want to talk to someone who will listen to me and help me and my parents just aren’t doing that rn. like i want to see a councillor - the uk is in a notional lockdown again so idek if that’s a possibility - but i can’t go without them knowing. 

does anyone have any suggestions on what i can do? thank you"
1605,KindOfBrill.com,"Hello Everyone! I hope you’re all doing well. 

My website is up-and-running, as you can see from the title. 

If you’re willing to give it a little read, give some feedback in the comments section or in the PM’s, it would be greatly appreciated. 

I’ve worked hard on this site, and even though it’s in an early stage of development, I am happy with the outcome. 

If you do give it a read, I thank you very much! :)"
1606,Tried to talk to an online troll,"I wanted to try talking to one of those people, and see how far it would go. I know it's not wise, but I wanted to see and try for the 1st time. It didn't go far and made me feel more negative, not because of the insults, but a reminder of crappy people that we have to put up with.

It's mainly that he thinks its alright to hurt people, he admits. No one gets to curse him, but he curses everyone. And I'm an immature moron for calling out his pointless, possibly harmful insulting.

I feel like wasting his energy on me was good enough for me in the end. But I still feel frustrated of his high and mighty attitude, he's not being ironic. I lowered myself, I proved myself, but to no avail. A lot of the way he phrases his words are very much r/iamverysmart stuff. The hypocrisy never ends.

In the end I was just tired and apologized for replying while saying I don't hate him, but I dislike and don't respect people like him. Because I do actually feel bad with what I say to people online.

Apart from imitating some of his replies and see how he would reply to his own insults (so he ends up insulting himself), I never really insulted him back, just calling out what he's doing.

Just so I wouldn't go back to reply, I'm venting here, lol. I'm no better than troll for replying to a troll, I feel like. A lesson learnt, I mean I kind of expected it would end this way, but I wanted to actually try it myself, and it doesn't feel good."
1607,Please help with my mental health care!,[removed]
1608,My school doesn’t offer help at all,"I’m 16 and still in high school. Last year I finally opened up about my mental health and got put on a waiting list for this youth mental health organization through my school. It’s been 7 months, I’ve heard nothing from this organization at all since then and my school is not doing anything for me anymore. They claim to help me, but the only help they’re giving me is an extra parent teacher meeting here and there that lead to absolutely nothing. I’m still on the waiting list and haven’t received any therapy or diagnoses because of it. 

My grades are bad because I can’t focus and have no motivation. I miss school all the time due to mental breakdowns and getting physically sick from my mental state. I likely qualify for the 15 minutes extra time some students get on tests, but because I don’t have any diagnoses I’m not getting that. 

I just feel like they’re doing absolutely nothing for me at all here and I’m slowly losing it because I can’t get therapy yet."
1609,Conspiracy theory belief vs suffering from delusions?,"My sister has battled mental health issues for years. I personally believe she has had crap doctors who made it worse with many medications, but that's a different discussion. :)

Primarily it's been anxiety and depression, mixed in the last few years with some what I'd think is mania. I don't see her often enough to know much more than this. 

Last year she's started talking about some weird shit. Like, the government being ran by reptilians or star seeds. \*shrug\*. And that some of us are part alien from \*I forget which planet\*. Basically- some very deep and out there conspiracy theories- if you could even call it that.

This morning she shared a post of a lens flare, which the original poster asked what planet it was. Someone commented on my sister's post and said it was just a lens flare, and my sister said ""nope, it's not- the universe is changing"". My wife got on and asked what she thought it was... her response?

A planet. Nibiru. She's seen it herself.

My concern with all of this is that she has two kids, living with her, she apparently has been hoarding (told by an old friend of hers) but she won't let anyone in to prove that's not true. She hasn't had a job in almost a year, and even when she was employed she missed it A LOT. Rolodex of excuses. Her kids haven't been enrolled in school half this school year, and when they were- it was like her and work. She'd allow them to stay home for any excuse they came up with. She got a divorce last year (her choice), and suddenly became secretly lesbian and has dated at least two people. One of which, claims to be a psychic and a witch... She's the one who reached out to our family concerned about my sister- saying she's hoarding, popping benzos while driving, blacking out, and not taking care of the kids (teenagers). The problem, this chick has a history of lying- she's been sued for libel and defamation of character. So, my parents don't hold her words worth much truth.  

So anyway. I don't know what to do. The little bit we've talked, and interacted via txt / facebook- it seems like she's losing her mind, and losing grip on reality. But, she's 40something... is it my business? 

What should I do??? Please help!"
1610,Psychotic family member won’t get help,"Hello everyone I posted here before but deleted the thread in case the family member finds out. I’m the only person that they trust now so I don’t want to ruin that. Forgive me if I cause any confusion.

“Family member” is out of the mental institution now and is back at home. This family member has completely cut us off from any updates of the medication and therapy so we don’t know if the treatment is being continued.

We (the rest of the family) are positive that the family member is it still psychotic and we are desperately tried to convince the family member to get help, with no luck of course. The family member is convinced nothing is wrong and continues with hallucinations and paranoia. 

We are very afraid that harm with come to the family member or others. We are planning on filling a warrant against them for involuntary commitment. Is anybody familiar with this action? What should we expect? Any input will help us. We are at our very limit with this.

We are in the state of Texas.

1611,AIs from AI Dungeon 2 to sexy to funny and one based wholly on Reddit!,[removed]
1612,Is my sibling's behavior concerning?,"Hey all, I'm completely new here. I hope this post is appropriate, as I've tried researching online but have not come up with much information, so I thought I'd come to this community for some guidance/opinions.

My sister (21) has some very unique behavior patterns that have caused concern in our family:

* Since a young age, she was never able to make/hold friendships. 
* She is extremely soft spoken when speaking to others, but when she is alone to her room, she is VERY loud. There are times where I ask if she is talking to anyone, but she is never on the phone/online with someone. She will laugh out loud to herself, have full on conversations with herself, and has a very strange knack of laughing to herself and running away when anybody sees her? She doesn't talk to anyone in our family or any friends (that I'm aware of), only to herself. 
* Recently she seems to have lost all sense of accountability/honesty. For example, I caught her smoking weed (I used to smoke and I really don't care about it, but our mom does and it's her house so...), so I politely asked her to maybe not do it when our mom was home. All she said was ""I'm not smoking, stop lying, you're crazy and you hate me and make up these lies."" This seems to be her defense when anyone questions her about anything: ""you're wrong, you're lying, I'm right, I can do no wrong."" 
* She doesn't ever seem to sleep. There are nights where she'll wake me up (we have adjoining rooms) at 3 a.m. with her laughter/yelling/talking to herself. She'll get up and leave the house about 3-4 times a night. I do not question her out of fear of her retaliation. 
* She doesn't seem to have any empathy for others. 

Of course, I am not looking for a diagnosis, nor am I able to diagnose her myself. From my online research, the signs/symptoms of Antisocial Personality Disorder seems to match her behavior the most. Again, any guidance/opinion will help, and if this isn't the right subreddit to discuss this, I hope someone can point me in the right direction."
1613,Please help me,"Okay. Ever since I was about 15 I’ve been diagnosed with BPD, bipolar disorder, depression and severe anxiety. I want to start this off with letting you know that. It’s been a rough life dealing with it for sure. But I need some advice on a situation in which I’m not sure if I’m being rational or not. 

In 2019 I started at my job and eventually after a few months there I became close friends with this guy who had just gotten out of rehab. We would flirt for a couple months and he’d call me everything and we’d joke about sexual things but he could not have sex yet because once you start the AA program you promise to not have sex until your “12 steps” are up. Which was cool with me. I liked him. We worked together so that was also a factor. I was hitting on him hardcore though. On March 1st of 2020, we finally slept together. After that night, we decided we were super attracted to each other and we’d keep it going as a FWB type situation as a secret because we worked together etc. 

Fast forward to October 2020. I find out I’m pregnant, he’s happy about it and we label ourselves as exclusive. In December he buys me an engagement ring and we are supposed to get married in February and then raise a baby together. Life seemed great. 

I’m crazy. Last weekend I went through his phone. Ever since we got together he told me I was the first girl he hooked up with after he finished his 12 steps and I always felt like it wasn’t true. On his phone, I found messages from literally a couple weeks before me and him hooked up of him texting his friends pictures of my “friend” that started working with us in January that he had finally finished his steps and “got a piece of ass”. I was devastated. He’s been lying to me this entire time. She had a boyfriend and he says they only slept together a few times before he finally hooked up with me but I feel so lost. He said he didn’t tell me because he didn’t want to hurt me and I shouldn’t have went through his phone and me and him weren’t even exclusive until a few months ago so I’m not sure if I should call the wedding off because of this or not. He was calling me telling me he didn’t want to sleep with me because we worked together while he was sneaking over to her house. I don’t know what to do. 

He’s amazing now in every way possible. I really do love him and if this is just my mental illness exaggerating something that he had every right to do I want to work on it. I just want to know what someone else in my situation would do. She’s so much prettier than me and I can see why he’d pick her over me. And I was actively hitting on him while I feel like it took her no effort to get him to sleep with her. Although I don’t know the entire story. I’m so lost. I feel like I was just a second choice. He says there’s no way I could be second choice if he’s marrying me and says I’m the greatest thing ever but I feel so hurt over the whole thing."
1614,I am tired of living in fear,"I’m a young guy, very early twenties. For as long as I can remember I’ve been living in irrational fear. When I got my first car at 17, I wasn’t happy about getting it because I feared that I would crash and die. I also feared that as I was pumping gas, the car would explode and I would be engulfed in flames. My dating life is horrible. I fall in love too quickly and my crippling paranoia of being abandoned draws a wedge between us, causing what I feared most to always happen. I fear that I’m not good enough to live a fruitful life, that I will never have the success to own a home, succeed professionally, to have a family with a wife that doesn’t leave me. Most recently I’m being kept up at night out of fear that I will die early from a terminal disease, or that I will be in a major accident. I have no idea what it’s like to live in the moment. I don’t understand why I can’t just fucking take a deep breath and enjoy the life I have without fearing things that haven’t even happened. I’m constantly paranoid and fearful about different shit that can happen to me, but is pretty improbable. It’s like my brain has a wheel and pin that spins and lands on something that I’ll worry about for either a few weeks, a few months, or even a few years. It reassures me that I’ll die one day, but it also terrifies me. It reassures me because If on the off chance that any of my fears do turn out to come true, that my suffering won’t be permanent. But it also terrifies me because what the fuck is after that? Nothingness? I don’t want to live a shitty life full of paranoia just to die one day when I could have lived in the moment and just fucking relaxed. I know this makes me a **GIANT PUSSY** but I can’t help it and I need to get this off my chest. Please, any advice will help. Tough love or sugar coated, it doesn’t matter. I feel like I’m drowning in this world full of people who have their shit together while I’m the only one who doesn’t. I know that’s far from the truth. I feel like I’m unique in a very bad way. I always have a feeling that I’m some kind of alien trying to adapt to a foreign planet. The most fucked up part about all of this is i have a pretty good life externally. I live in a decent neighborhood, loving family, fairly decent childhood minus the separations, divorces and remarriages that I was dragged through. Damn, man. I wish I had a big brother. I could have used the guidance. Since I don’t, I would really appreciate some guidance/ advice on here. I might post this on a few other subs."
1615,Parent (and mother bf) smoking in the house. what can i do to stop them??,"Okay so last year my my mom used to smoke in her room causing all her things her room to smell like smoke. when she opened her door the smell would drift into my room and throw me into a mental breakdown. she didn’t used to smoke before i wish she’d just do it outside. 

we ended moving last year in february and she promised me she wouldn’t smoke in her room anymore because it really affects me. she didn’t until the middle of december. her current boyfriend (of like 5 months)moved in while we were on vacation (we didn’t know about this until last minute.) my moms room has this extra room with a bunch of windows- basically like a balcony but not really ?? and he smokes weed in there which FILLS the whole upstairs. my mom has also started smoking in there. 

i’ve complained many times and i just don’t know what to do anymore. she says she doesn’t want to tell him to stop since she’s been helping her with bills and house stuff. it isn’t fair imo to put her s/o before her kids and what they’re comfortable but that’s how she’s always been. 

does anyone know what i should even do?? i’ve tried talking to her but i’m genuinely not that comfortable talking to her about things like this. my gf and sister say i should just ask her bf upfront to stop,, I’m 16 now and if i can’t get them to stop i’m just gonna wait it out until i can leave but i really just want it to stop now.. 

(when i was like 13 we were in the middle of moving and the water shut off in our house. she left me all alone in that house for a month while she went to her bfs house. i couldn’t shower or flush the toilet it was genuine hell.. eventually i went to a friends house and stayed until i left with my older sister for a month...)"
1616,Depressed boyfriend ignores me frequently and won’t say why. Should I just accept he does this?,"Me and my boyfriend talk all day everyday pretty much. But sometimes he will randomly stop messaging me for a few hours, or the wait until the next day. I’ve spoken to some people about it and they say it’s probably his depression.

I have asked him before why he ignores me and he just ignores that too. Or when he will come out of it act like nothing happened. A couple times I have asked “are you ok?” And he will say “I’m fine” and start messaging me again. If he ignores me for a while he will normally just send me a message like “I love you” to get the conversation going again.

I’ve asked him why he ignores me and as I said he ignores that. There have been maybe only two occasions where I got a reason. This is when I left it a few hours then messaged something else like “everything ok? I love you” etc. He will normally say he’s just stressed then start chatting again.

I told him that it makes me anxious when he doesn’t response and that’s why I push. I just feel like he does it on purpose now or it doesn’t care. He ignores other people as well. Am I just overthinking and is this a part of him I just have to accept as it’s because of depression? It’s so much I mind if he needs space, it’s the not knowing."
1617,How do I stop people from thinking about me when I'm not directly in their periphery?,"Hello, didn't know where else to post this and I couldn't get specific results from Google. 

I'd like to know how to convince people to stop talking about me even in a positive way, acknowledging my existence and if it can be helped thinking about me. I don't have any real issues except that I wish I only existed when directly spoken to like an imaginary friend I wish that nobody cared about me so that I'd be like a dog and ideally if you know a genie, I'd like to vanish out of photos after I die. Marty McFly style.

I always get surprised when my brothers or sisters call me by name and I consider myself a fairly good friend, brother and an ok son but now it's really causing me tension to think people are thinking about me and I don't know what to do to alleviate this or make it so that is simply unpleasant to think about me until they no longer do.

Thanks. Steven! just coming!

P.s my name is not Steven."
1618,Does anyone else do random stuff so they don’t self harm?,"
I’ve been in a really bad place today and as the night draws in it seems to get drastically worse . It’s 9pm and I have just cleaned the toilet by using different coloured bleach and a toothbrush. Why ? So I don’t sit and cut myself. I also spent an hour polishing my wardrobe with a sponge . Again stupid. I just hate being alone . At night I get intrusive thoughts about everyone hating me and then I hurt myself and spiral into death , you know the drill . It’s now 9 pm and I’m sat here alone . It’s gonna be a long night 😫"
1619,How do you deal with your friends having other interests than you do?,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but here goes. When I was younger I wasn't interested in a lot of things going on outside, mainly because I didn't have a lot of friends. The friends I did have at the time I mostly bonded with over video games. As I grew older I realized that I wanted to do more. I wanted to go clubbing and dancing and traveling, while my friends did not show the same interest. Due to this I never really got to go anywhere, because I didn't want to do it on my own. When I hit university I finally found some friends who were down for these things and I was super happy. Unfortunately when the outbreak hit my country I had a mental break and most of these new friends decided that they didn't want to stick around for that. I am eternally grateful to the ones who did stick around and who have helped me a lot, but they have their own lives and (I feel horrible saying this) we don't have a whole lot in common.

While I am very grateful that I have friends that I can count on when it matters I find it tiring to keep cycling through the same few subjects whenever we meet, however I also find it demotivating to be excited about something without anyone to talk to who truly understands. What can I do? Am I being ungrateful?"
1620,I don’t know what to do,"I’m really struggling at the moment with my anxiety to a point where it’s getting so I can barely stand the thought of leaving my room or even speaking to anyone except my flatmate. 

I’ve been to the doctors before over the past 7 years but was never really ready to accept help, I guess I just thought it’ll get better and I’ll grow out of it but all that’s really happened is that things have been getting worse more frequently to the point it’s now affecting pretty much every part of my life. 

The last time I called my gp (I’m from the uk) about it about 6 months ago, the doctor I spoke to didn’t listen to my concerns and told me I shouldn’t be registered there anymore (this was over lockdown, but really besides the point). 

I recently just cut the middle man and referred myself online to a group in my area that offer counselling, but all I got for confirmation was a tiny “successful” in the top of the last page with no indication of when or even if they’d contact me. I’ve had no confirmation email or anything. 

I really feel like I’m at the end of my rope here with options. I actually feel ready for the first time in my life to start feeling better than this and I don’t think any is available for me now. I know we’re still in lockdown, but I need to go back to work and I’m so mentally unwell I know I won’t be able to perform. I don’t want anyone at work to know anything if I can help it. 

What else can I do?"
1621,"Being bullied 15+ years ago still impacts me now, anyone else?","Maybe this isn't the right place to post this, but I'm just looking for anyone else who has had a similar experience. I realised tonight that a big reason why I'm so stuck in my career (not advancing) is lack of motivation caused by bullying when I was aged 11-14. 

Basically I was bullied for answering questions in class, knowing shit, doing anything ""smart"", coming into class with homework, etc. It's like I decided that to survive, I had to put in minimal effort, not do work, even play up in class. Obviously my grades dropped, but school was more tolerable.

However, 15 years later this attitude is still there, however much I might want to be ambitious or dream about being the best in my industry. It's like I'm scared of doing well. Can anyone else relate, or have any suggestions on how I can combat this? It's really getting me down."

1624,Therapist recommendations? Help!,"I’ve been looking for a good therapist since forever. I’ve been through a small handful. 

I downloaded an app and paid for a month sub. I’m so disappointed so far ugh 

I don’t have insurance and would love recommendations for therapist that offers virtual appointments. 

Thank you in advance ❤️"
1625,im very concerned for my sex life,"i am a straight male, but my problem is (with women at least) is that i am physically repulsive, my ego is down to a point where i actually have a mask i wear in public that covers my entire head, including my eyes, because i genuinely believe it would be better on other peoples eyes to not see my face, though i know its probably not true. anyways skip over to the part i find concerning about this, men make me feel more physically attractive than women, i get compliments from men about my looks, and as weird as it is ive even experimented with sexting another man (he was the one who initiated it and i said fuck it and went with it)  
i dont know why men make me feel more attractive, i guess its just the compliments i get from them and the lack of emotional manipulation, problem is, im not attracted to men, im not in any way gay, i just accept compliments from men, and even occasionally will sext with men because it just makes me feel more attractive, i dont even get off from it  
i dont want to turn out gay just because i feel more attractive around men, because as i said, im not really attracted to men"
1626,Why do I absolutely lose it mentally when I talk to my mom?,"I know my mom is a person but she was just awful growing up. She would blame me for everything and we went to strange guys houses on the DL as kids even tho she was married to my dad.
She used to just beat us and just yell all the fucking time and roast us.

Now she’s much better as a person and it’s been years since I lived with her. But every time I have to talk to her I actively avoid it as much as possible. Sometimes I call her cuz she’s actually nice and I’m like “ okay let’s try to repair what’s been broken” but when she blames me or just raises her voice I end up crying and fucking losing it mentally. Apparently my dad isn’t any better with covid and she told me that- BUT MY DAD JUST SAID HE WAS SO WHAT IS IT MOM

I’m fucking losing a sense of reality and it’s all my fault things aren’t working out. Why do I just mentally get lost? 

What’s wrong?

I can’t handle talking to her I can’t handle anything

This shit has affected me so much"
1627,What are intrusive thoughts,I saw a tiktok about them and i think i have based of the video can someone please explain to me what they are
1628,derealization?? issues with appearance?? i don't know,"everything feels really confusing. i don't feel like a real person with agency. i feel like a character who's being written by someone else. i feel fake. i don't really recognize myself and the way i look, especially being asian i feel like i should look white. and be prettier than i am. anything i say feels like a lie because i don't know anything about myself, like are these my real opinions? are the things i say things i actually wanna say, or things i think other people wanna hear? i can't say no to anything because i never have a good reason to not do anything. i forget that other people know me and care about me and that the things i do are real, and not just me steering someone around in a video game. i have sex with people i don't wanna have sex with. i just wanna feel real and beautiful and if i'm beautiful enough to have sex with then maybe i'm real. there's a guy who likes me and i didn't realize he actually likes me as a person because i don't feel like a person anyone could like, and i don't feel like a person, period. i thought he just wanted to have sex and just said he cared and that he liked me to be nice. i feel really bad for thinking that, i feel bad that he has these feelings towards me and i can't reciprocate because i just feel nothing towards anyone now. the guy i dated for a little bit is talking to someone new and while i know i've been over him for a while i feel a little bit like i failed at something, i failed at being ""good"" at being a woman. she's skinny and a dancer and she's white and pretty and she rollerskates and is basically just super cool and beautiful and i gained weight and i don't have a nose bridge like her and i just feel really ugly. and i think maybe i don't recognize the way i look because i don't want to recognize it. i don't want that person to be me. i wanna be cooler and whiter and skinnier than this version of me, as much as that sounds whiny. i know i have it good. i just want to not be the way i am anymore. i've lost 13 pounds so far and it doesn't feel like enough i still feel so big and disgusting. it's so hard to hold a conversation with anyone anymore. i don't know what anything is. nothing is real. it's so weird to try to explain it because i don't know what's going on i just know i haven't been a real person for a while. this isn't my life. i'm trying to be happy but i want to start over"
1629,Mild help required,"I am in a state of total disarray. I am high school senior,a male, and this is the first time I feel like I need to hide my true identity and let out all what's stuck within me. I'm not a 14 year old who's making up a story to get attention, rather I am truly feeling unwell.

I was never a huge fan of social media, I always prioritised one on one conversations over texting and this meant I had an active social life in school and in generally anywhere. However,the pandemic has restricted me to my home, and the only way to stay in touch was via the internet. I am not a particularly likeable guy over texting ( at least,that's what I believe) and so I refrained texting too many ppl. I felt socially isolated, and friendships were dwindling. It all came to light on my bday, when I barely received 5 wishes, and this came as a shock ( I was among the more popular, friendlier and socialable ppl in school). Right now I feel like I have no true friends, and when they do text me it's almost always a favour to be asked. It has felt like a fall from glory from me, from a fairly sociable guy to the outcast. 

Moreover, I'm the smartest kid in school(not tryna brag), and this means ppl are usually afraid to converse with me or become my friend, firstly coz they think I'm always engaged with books (which is wholly untrue) and secondly they look at me as someone too mature to be friends with ( which is untrue too). Despite having a few months left in school, it feels like an eternity to get through. 

Now that school has opened, I still feel the same and the exuberance from my personality has disappeared. I'm also overwhelmed by the university application process and have been worrying about it continuously. It all has added up, and I feel crushed by the thought of all what I've mentioned.

Thank you for reading if u have gone through this entire text, and any advice is welcome to deal with the situation."
1630,Help please.,Im supposed to be doing a homework that makes me write positive things about myself. Im so used to being negative that I cant think about anything good about myself.
1631,Worsening Sensory Overload?,"First and foremost I am not professionally diagnosed with anything, although I have had a few people in my lifetime including therapists say that I may have ADHD, however I'm only mentioning that for potential context, I am not claiming to have anything even if I do experience symptoms that resemble it. I have experienced sensory overload my whole life but it has been bearable for the majority of it. However in the past few months it has started becoming worse and worse. I'm not bothered by loud noises all that much, however when there are multiple different noises coming from different sources it's incredibly difficult to cope. As I said it's been something I could handle up until recently, even some minor instances like someone talking while I'm trying to watch something can have me almost on the verge of tears, and with a less than understanding family it's not exactly something I can talk out with them. Anyone have any advice on dealing with it? Preferably advice on situations where removing yourself isn't exactly an option."
1632,i dont know whats going on,"i get into moods of being extremely depressed, autopilot (i dont know how to describe it its like im here but im not,  anger, very happy and confident, paranoid, feeling like im not real

i switch through all these moods so quickly and its hard to control and some people think im crazy bc last year i was convinced the gov was spying on me so i taped up my phone and Alexa and hid in my room all day. im just confused right now and i dont know who i am i just dont know. last year i was convinced that i saw a ghost and i told some people and they thought i was crazy and i dont blame them. pls just help or something im confused"
1633,Will I be able to recover?,"I just need some kind of assurance that I'll be able to return to my old self. I'm so desperately afraid of staying like this forever. I feel so dumb that i can't even properly structure this post - I'm just writing as I think.

For the last 3 years, I've been experiencing major stressors, while at the same time doing absolutely nothing productive. This is alredy the most I've written in many months. I've spent these last 3 years feeling extremely stressed and afraid of everything, isolating myself from friends &amp; family and losing a LOT of sleep. Now that circumstances have forced me to step up (or the closest to that that I'm able) and begin studying again, I'm confronted by how much of my smarts I lost. When I lay in bed, my mind is blank. I can spend an entire day without forming a coherent thought. When I sit to write (something at which I was very good) I realize how severely my executive functions have been damaged. I can no longer  have interesting ideas and write them cohesevely: I can only choose between a word salad or a bizarre, vague and unpersonal text like this one.

I feel SO incredibly dumb and pathetic, but I just wish people with whom i vent stopped focusing on how I feel. To me it is a fact that I have brain damage. I just want to know if I can reverse it. I don't how I'll be able to keep on knowing I'll never be my old self again. So I don't know what I'm looking for here. Can anyone explain consisely/with autorithy if It's possible to recover? All the articles I find are so confusing. Do you know any stories of people who were able to come back to their old selves?
There's so much more that i didn't explain. I just feel too dumb to put it all in words. 
And yes I'm starting therapy next week. But I'm just feeling so devastated right now."
1634,"I think I might be on the autistic spectrum, not sure (f/18)","     I wanna start off by saying that I'm not officially diagnosed with anything, these are just some symptomes that I noticed in my behaviour over time. I really need an unbiased opinion about these, and I guess some advice.
     So here it goes: I always had a hard time making friends and you know..keeping them. Whenever I'm outside my house it feels like I'm in a bubble, and never really in the moment, even with my closest friends. Whenever I do go out with other people I always try to imagine what it's going to be like, and if I don't have a clear picture in my head I tend to feel anxious sometimes to the point of crying. People also keep mentioning that I'm constantly fidgeting with something, tapping on tabletops, flipping pens between my fingers, the works. 
       I'm also very very sensitive to crowds in small spaces, I once had a panic attack on a packed bus because of all the noise and the proximity of all the bodies and smell. ((I still have to commute but I never ever leave my house without my headphones)) 
       I guess that's most of it, that's relevant to the topic. Hope I didn't offend anyone :)) ((also sorry for any mistakes, english is not my native language))"
1635,Headspace,"To those struggling with mental health issues, anxiety and depression, or basically anyone in general, should check out Headspace: Guide to Meditation on Netflix. It really teaches you how to meditate and understand the science behind it. Meditation and relaxation is such an important coping skill, and this show helped me focus my mind more."
1636,Worsening Sensory Overload,"Hi, I've experienced sensory overload my whole and  life up until a few months ago it's been completely bearable. My sensory overload doesn't kick in for loud noises, more so for when multiple noises are coming from different sources at once. With a few noisy pets, a loud family (who will almost certainly not hear me out if I try to tell them being that I'm almost 18 and have never mentioned it for fear they wouldn't take me seriously) and paper thin walls, it's really not something I can avoid. Very minor things have been setting me off recently, to the point where a week or two ago I compulsively screamed because of how overwhelmed I was. Does anyone have any advice on dealing with this? Preferably advice for when you can't remove yourself from the situation."
1637,Looking for insights on a matter,"I was gonna try to be all vague and “let’s say hypothetically...” about this but it feels like a waste of time, instead I’m just going to say I’m not looking for an armchair diagnosis, just some opinions on if what I’m dealing with presently sounds like it could be linked to something in particular?

Basically, I’ve had intrusive thoughts of all kinds for at least 15 years now, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD (among other things, relevant later) so I tend to just do whatever my brain wants me to to get it to shut up, as long as it’s within reason; usually it is because the really bad/persistent thoughts trend towards like “You might have cancer” and then I’ll look up cancer symptoms and go “sorry, brain, looks like I have absolutely none of these,” and that’s worked pretty well for the last couple of years.

Unfortunately my (presumably still just) intrusive thoughts have taken a weird turn lately. At this point, I should mention I have also been diagnosed with C-PTSD and, more vaguely, “dissociative tendencies” stemming from it. So, I’ve been getting into these states where I’m probably dissociating and get very detached from reality, and instead of the standard “you could die from xyz thing, better go do abc compulsion if you want to Not die” my brain has taken to straight-up telling me “you’re already almost dead, this is a hallucination as your brain shuts down,” or “you’re actually not real, none of this is real, you’re just floating around the empty universe imagining all of it,” or, arguably the most distressing, I’ve been mulling over this scenario where I’ve actually somehow ‘reset’ my life multiple times over to try and fix things that went wrong, but every attempt has failed and the attempt I’m on right now is my last chance — this one’s really hard to snap myself out of as I get really worked up and panicky about it and it stops me from breaking through it on my own, I’ll have to just distract myself until enough time has passed and I’ve stopped thinking about it.

So, obviously that’s kinda concerning. I’ve been operating on the assuming that it’s just a new brand of my usual intrusive thoughts/ them combining with the dissociation, because anything else seems kind of extreme or inaccurate. Like, I’ve had a friend suggest that it sounds like some kind of psychosis but as far as I know I don’t have any hallucinations going, it’s just the thought process itself and how lost I get in it. Later on when I’m out of that process and going on about my daily life I can recognize that that’s all really out there and obviously not true, but while I’m in it I’m thoroughly convinced it is and start spiraling because of how upset I am about it.

Anyway, I won’t keep ranting, I just want to ask if this sounds like anything to anyone who might know more than me; I don’t have a way to see a therapist right now but when I can, I’d like to be able to form coherent sentences to bring this up, lol. Thanks in advance, I appreciate any advice anyone can give me."
1638,The loneliness that comes with being mentally ill,"It feels like I’m fighting constantly to survive. And no one understands or knows what to say. At this point I don’t know if this is just how people commonly act towards one another, or if I just have mostly uncaring people. I really want to kill myself. I really want to die. I really want to stop existing to feel this pain. The sad part is, when you’re dead that’s when people want to wish they have their all, they’ve tried their best, they payed more attention. But when you’re alive screaming for help, no one bats an eye. They walk away. They don’t know how to respond so they change the subject entirely, unintentionally dismissing your suffering. Only making you feel more lonely and disconnected from the world. I’m going to think about dying. I don’t want to because I do have a reason to keep going. But when I feel I’m hurting that reason, and I’m being toxic and unhealthy, they don’t need me. They don’t need this treatment from me. I’m better off dead. I already feel dead as it is. I thought I was doing so well. And now I’m back to suffering so much emotional pain that it turns physical and I feel like I’m dying mentally and physically."
1639,WFH causing anxiety/depression,"How do you detach work from home life?

I’ve been WFH since March last year due to the pandemic and recently noticed that my mental health has been suffering. My home office is in my bedroom so everyday it seems like I’m waking up working eating sleeping and repeat. I live with my family but I feel cramped up in my room and detached from the world. Work has been really busy the past few months and even after I’ve finished for the day I cant stop thinking about the next day and get anxiety. I guess it doesn’t help that I don’t feel like I am good at my job. I am introverted/socially awkward so I am not really close with any of my colleagues either. I exercise  but that doesn’t seem to be helping me mental health wise.

I didn’t feel like this back when I was in the office and I guess WFH is giving me anxiety/making me depressed. Do you guys have any advice on how to detach myself from work?"
1640,How to know if I should switch councelors?,"How do I know if I should switch counselors or not? How long should I wait to know?

Edit spelling (as you can see in the title, I'm an idiot)"
1641,Self Isolation (Non Covid),"I had a breakdown over the last week. I destroyed my self worth and value. All the progress I made over the year feels like it completely fell apart. I have struggled with my self-concept for a very long time. I always feel flawed. Sometimes, I don't think people genuinely like me or value me as a person. I always seem to convince myself that people are pitying me, or that it's some attempt at humouring me to keep me from bothering them with my problems. I have a hard time venting to friends and family because I feel as though I'm annoying them.

I started isolating myself from my friends and social media. I feel awful because I just went off the map with no explanation. I've done it before but not like this. Sometimes it lasts a few days and I snap out of it but it's been a week and now I'm worried this will end my relationships with the only friends I have. I contemplate apologizing because I don't like this, I just needed to get away from everyone. I don't want people to look at me as pitiful or weak, an emotional charity case.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else ever dealt with this? How do you come back after self-isolating yourself from everyone?"
1642,Today is the day.,"I have struggled with some shit for a while now and i can't take it any more. I have been thinking about suicide for a long time now. I have tried to talk to some people a few times but I am to introverted to talk about this to someone without getting drunk and when i am drunk ( yes i am addicted to alcohol) nobody listens to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I just wanted to tell everyone who is in a bad situation right now that you should talk to someone. No matter who it is. Even Talking to strangers on the internet is very helpful (if it is not a troll). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways.  
Don't make the mistakes i made. Talk to people if you need help!

I'll see you in the next live.

1643,I'm lost. (19 years old),"Hello , 
This is gonna be long so i'm sorry for that.
It's actually my whole life story and I still do feel
depression , if you will read everything you will understand why.
Thanks for reading.

A few years ago , back in 2012 , when I was only 11 years old , I found out about a video game, after checking out the game , I found there a server I liked , I really liked it and eventually I got addicted to it , I even put real money in this game , I played for a while using cheats and then got banned , when I got unbanned I kept using cheats and got banned again and again , when I started playing I told to myself that my biggest dream ever is being an administrator in this server (I was 11 years old only , so yeah it was actually my biggest dream) , after getting jailed ingame , I left for a while , then came back in 2015 (was 14 years old then) , I asked for another chance because this game actually was my life and I couldn't stop playing it , I was addicted , this time I played without cheats , I started a new paper and tried my luck, then I got helper rank , which is 2 ranks below administrator , and then I was so happy , after I cheated that much , I succeed let the admins team trust me and promote me to helper rank , after a year , I got promoted to moderator rank (I was 15 years old then) , in the meantime , while playing this game , I kept playing playing , I played for the WHOLE DAY , I didn't even leave my home because I was so addicted , and it badly damaged me and my social skills without even noticing it. After I got promoted to moderator rank which is 1 rank below administrator , something happened , something that may or may not be good for me , I was 17 years old when it happened (2018) , aight so this is the case , when I was a moderator , there was a guy who had issues with the owner of the server , let's call him Daniel (not real name of course) , Daniel had some problem with the owner of the server and the owner permanently banned him from the server , Daniel decided to make an internet blog which he posted there alot of cheats for the server , at the same time , someome from the adminis team were leaking him admins' informations.
Something I didn't state till now is that I got a brother that played in this server too , we played from the same IP address , so after Daniel posted cheats in his blog , my brother said in a public chat ""I'm using Daniel's cheats"" , usually you wouldn't be banned for admiting you used cheats , but since the case with Daniel was sensitive , my brother got banned , and so am I , because we played from the same IP address , so I asked the owner if he can unban me and I can still play , he said yes , but he didn't give me back the moderator rank , which I really wanted to die at the same time , imagine breaking the trust in you , and you build it up slowly , and once you built it up , everything explodes in your face because a stupid sentenece your brother said , so since then (still 2018) , i'm telling myself , FUCK MY LIFE , what do I do now , this game was EVERYTHING for me , and now when my biggest dream couldn't be accomplished , I started asking myself , why i'm even alive , I can't talk to ANY person except my family , this addiction actually got me social anxiety , which i'm dealing with till today , after all these things happened , I tried to survive, not killing myself , then my life got to point which I couldn't handle anymore , I had to go to army in a few months from there , in 2019 , I shared my feelings in local forum of my country , I said there that I don't wanna live anymore because i'm kinda dead in an alive body , which isn't a lie actually , so after I did that , police came to my house and they actually took me to an hospital for people with mental issues , I was there for a week or so and told the psychologists there that the admins of that forum probably got me wrong because most of them are kids (which wasn't a lie), but they didn't really get me wrong ,after releasing from that hospital I tried to stay in a positive mind but I just couldn't , the depression was much stronger , after a few months of trying , I went to army , (in my country you have to go to army) , on one hand , I didn't want to go to army because I told myself ""maybe it's your time to leave it all and start living as you should"" , because I was in that hospital I could choose not to go to army , but I chose to do that anyways , I hope that it would make me stronger phyaically and mentally , but it didn't help me at all , I went to army in Feb 2020 instead of Dec 2019 because of that history.

Okay so now when we already im 2021 , I have been in army for a while , about an half year actually , and I don't feel it actually changes me or makes me stronger ,i'm now an actual soldier which is 19 years old with social anxiety , and this is why i'm so depressed , imagine people in my age and even younger, go to bars, clubs, enjoying life as teenagers , and I can't even go myself to a shop and buy myself a product , theoritically , while they are running , I didn't even start crawling , and now i'm in a situation of my life that I don't know what I should do , after getting released from that hospital they said I have to meet a pshycologist , and I tried once , but they didn't give me the pshycologist I needed and it really didn't help me that much , so now after this ""book"" I would say , i'm trying to find a reason to stay alive , and even try to be positive , but I just can't find that reason, the army doesn't let me be in home for the whole week , only in weekends , and it doesn't really giving me time to invest it in self-development which I think I currently need, I don't know what I should do now in my life , I feel lost , I have social anxiety in 19 years old while being a soldier and no one really knows about that, and I don't have anyone to share it with,because of my social anxiety I don't have any friends and my family isn't really supportive , seems like they doesn't care about my feelings, I hope you actually read all (which you probably didn't) , and if you did, YOU ARE AMAZING , I really appreciate it , because it was really long.
Please give me some advices what you think I can do because i'm really lost now."
1644,Anyone wanna vent to me? Just Pm me,I wanna know that I'm not the only weird person
1645,There's another person in me apart from me.,"Hi everyone!

I (F16) just made a proper account on reddit to ask this question because I really want to know what's going on. I feel like I have another person who is with me at all times.

I don't really know much about him but I know that his name is Fraser and he is here to protect me and make sure I never feel alone. 

I am pretty sure that I created him a few years ago when I was around 14-ish. This was at a time when I was VERY depressed and suicidal. I had almost attempted a week before and was lying on my bed at 2 in the morning feeling more lonely than I think I have ever felt. I cant remember really how it happened, but suddenly he was just sort of there, lying next to me. He has been with me ever since.

For context: I had a pretty normal childhood (no major trauma) and I am not experiencing any huge memory gaps (I have a pretty bad memory anyway) I don't actually see Fraser, he is normally just in my head apart from sometimes when I 'feel' him physically around me (like sitting or standing near me). He almost never speaks, I talk to him sometimes and very occasionally I feel like I get one-word answers, but that never really happens. I think his purpose is to stop the loneliness, as I have never felt completely alone since.

At first I thought he was just like an imaginary friend or something, but I think I am a little to old for that, he feels more real, and I never had and imaginary friends growing up.

It would be really nice if anyone could help me with answers on this, I've been thinking about posting for a while and I'm glad I'm actually doing it. Please leave a comment if you think you can help, but if you cant then thanks for making it all the way to the end! 

Tl;DR Fraser is a person in my head, looking for reasons why"
1646,I can't concentrate or focus on anything and it's making life really difficult?,"Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this but I figured here would be my best shot at getting some advice.

So, when I was younger, I was an extremely gifted kid. I would always get the highest grades without putting any effort in and I was way above the rest of my class when it came to spelling, maths, reading and writing. I always spent very little time on my homework and always left it to the last minute but still managed to get good grades. 

When I went to secondary school, this tactic obviously didn't work. I was in the highest sets but my grades were always so much lower than everyone else's, causing me to feel ashamed and embarrassed, refusing to tell any of my friends what I got on tests. I could never spend more than fifteen minutes on my homework without getting extremely frustrated and bored and that resulted in me putting the homework away and forgetting to do it completely. 

When the deadlines approached, I'd make up an excuse to the teacher and since I was such a well behaved student, I got away with it every time. When it came to my GCSEs, I hardly revised because I just couldn't remember anything I wrote down so I decided what was the point? I finished my GCSEs with slightly above average grades, despite my teachers and parents expecting me to do a lot better. I know I could've gotten really high grades if I had just revised but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

I'm currently in college, studying two a-levels and a btec. I find it really hard to concentrate in class and get easily distracted by random things going on outside the window. When the teacher explains the task to the class, I completely zone out and end up asking my friends what we had to do. Whenever the teachers set us homework, I type out the title, stare at the screen blankly for about half an hour and then eventually shut the webpage down to do something else or sometimes I forget the question completely and freak out the day before it's due. 

I currently have three essays to write that were all due in November, a personal statement to write that is due at the end of this month, weeks of work to catch up with due to covid isolation and two pieces of coursework that I should've started last year and everything keeps building up. I keep telling my parents that everything is going fine and that I'm doing all my homework but that's a total lie. It's spiralling out of control and my teachers are starting to get mad at me which is causing me a lot of stress and anxiety.

It's not just college that I'm having trouble with. Life in general is just getting too much for me to cope with. I have absolutely no concept of time so when I think a task will only take me a few minutes, it usually takes me an hour and then I freak out about it. Whenever someone gives me instructions, I often find that I have no idea what they just said to me and I feel like my thoughts are constantly racing, making it hard to concentrate on just one thing. This makes is really hard to sleep sometimes. I'm constantly getting told by people that I'm not going to get anywhere in life because of all this and it's really upsetting me.

Anyway, I apologise that this is so long and if it doesn't make much sense. I just really need help before I do end up failing college and then everything else after that. I don't feel like I'm cut out to be an adult and it's giving me a lot of anxiety about the future. Any advice?

Tl;dr - I can't concentrate on anything, life is really stressful as a result, I have several pieces of work to do for college that I can't bring myself to do and I feel like I'm going to fail as a result."
1647,How do I get my imagination back?,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health for about 10 years whether I realized it or not, I’m finally seeing that. After starting therapy and reading a lot, I’m so desperate to get back to my old self. Confident, goofy, not overly serious, just back to feeling free. But I’ve realized I’ve lost all of my creativity and imagination. 

Does anyone else ever feel that way? How do I get my imagination &amp; my curiosity back?"
1648,I can’t make it without my favorite person,"
I have known him for 6 years. When we first met it didn’t take long, before I fell in love with him. My heart is still telling me he is the one. We grew closer and closer. We ended up dating for 3 years. But all that ended two weeks ago.......
He called it off. He told me he is no longer happy in the relationship. That it is nothing personal to do with me. The only thing he is happy with now is his job, and talking with his other guy friends. He can’t see himself in any relationship at the moment or in the future. 
But the truth is that our relationship has never been stable or healthy. It has had so many ups and downs more than a relationship should. Really bad things has happened in the past. So bad that even my family and friends used to tell me, that he was not a good guy, and tried to influence me to leave the relationship. They like him now. But I haven’t told them every part of our relationship, because if I did I’m sure their opinion would change. 
I used to always be the one who broke us up. Before we were together for 3 years, we had dated for 8 months in the past, but I ended up breaking up with him, because I had been hurt real bad. We were separated for 6 months, until he begged me to come back. I never got over him although 6 months had passed. I just acted like I had. In the last 3 months of the current time,  I have ended the relationship several times, which usually only lasted a couple of days before I went back to him. 
I’m not only madly in love with him. I’m obsessed with him. I spend hours a day thinking and daydreaming about him whether we are together or not. I love him so much, that I don’t have the strength to leave him. I’m completely blinded by my love for him, ignoring that he used to be domestic violent, lying and jealous in the past. With him, I feel like I’m dating multiple persons. He can be the sweetest person ever, being obsessed with me  and talking about how we are going to get married and have kids in the future. Or he can be stone cold, neglecting me, yelling at me and use verbal attack. When we have a good time together it feels like it’s the reason I’m living, because it’s the best thing ever I know. But when we have a bad time together it’s like my whole world is tearing apart.
We still live together in his home. He says I can stay here until I find my own apartment. We still sleep together. Although he broke up, he still wants me to be his only and regular sex partner.
I act like I’m fine, when he’s around. But when he’s not, I sometimes get mental breakdowns. I have unstoppable crying. I lost what meant the most to me. I have gotten suicidal thoughts, as I can’t imagine a life without my favorite person in it......."
1649,How can I get a Reddit user help? Please help gangjagirl123,"https://www.reddit.com/u/ganjagirl123/

1650,Nightmares Nightmares Nightmares!,"I (20F) have a lot of nightmares... I wake up a lot, I don't sleep very well and don't feel well rested alot of the time because of this. I've even gotten to a point where I'm so sacred of having nightmares that I don't want to sleep.

I'm so ""tired"" (haha, funny pun) of having stressfull dreams about being chased, killed... other stuff.
I get/have so many dreams like that it's the ""norm"" for me. I don't even wake up from the majority of them anymore and just wake up feeling unrested and uneasy.

The worst part is when I do have a really bad one I'll start panicking a bit when I wake up because I don't know if I'm back in the old house being terrorised by my shitty dad. I hate it so much. Those dreams are the closest I get to relive my childhoodtrauma. It's so realistic and scary.

I just want to have a good night sleep :("
