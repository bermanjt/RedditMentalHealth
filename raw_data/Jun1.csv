0,Just needing to vent.. feel so alone.,"So I’m a 22 year old female who has struggled with depression for years. I finally started going to therapy a few months ago and got put on antidepressants; which I think has helped tremendously. I’ve wanted to hang out with people. Get out of the house. Live my life. Seems like they’re working, right? According to my mom though she preferred the depressed daughter who never tried to leave the house and constantly was suicidal. She has contacted my therapist on numerous occasions saying the meds need to be changed and that I’m not the same daughter anymore. My birthday is also this week and she’s beyond livid that I wanted to go out with my friends this weekend and I should spend MY birthday with her because she’s more important. Everything has to be about her anymore and if I even touch my phone when I’m with her, she flips shit. It lit up from a notification earlier and she about threw my phone. It’s breaking my mental health down to worse than it was. I’m hiding in the bathroom bawling. I can’t do it anymore. It’s breaking me. I’m not strong enough.

Edit: she found out I was on my phone and is going off on me outside the bathroom door"
1,It took me fifteen years to realize the reason behind my speech impediment,"I don't remember most of this. I was about four when me and my mom moved in with her parents. I was super young so all I remember is me throwing a toy in my grandpa's eye and him yelling something at me.
Fast forward one year, I stuttered so much I was unintelligible. I went to a speech therapist everyday for a year. I speak normally know. All this time I thought it was just regular growing up stuff. Turns out my grandparents caused me to have so much stress I couldn't speak for a year after I left, and if my mom hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known. Ever. Thanks for the trauma guys"
2,I cut just so I get scars,"I don’t know why but when I cut it’s not for the relief like everyone else it’s seeing the cut/ blood and then seeing the scar...

Maybe I’m a sociopath or something but looking at my old ones makes me happy 

Am I crazy or insane"
3,Why does nobody like me...,"I haven’t had actual friends in years I try so hard but I’m just not into the whole chatting shot behind people’s back so it always fails 


I’m so lonely I just want to die 

Everything’s so overwhelming all I’ve done since lockdown started was get drunk 

I hate myself so much"
4,How do you know if you're an incel?,"I recently heard about incels and read up on the topic a little. I have some of the characteristics of an incel, but I don't have a hatred of women. So am I an incel? Can someone give me a simple breakdown of what an incel is? Thank you. Your input is appreciated."
5,Poem depression.,"Ever felt so…fucking depressed?

Gettin out beds hard.…and gettin’ dressed 

I work so hard but, if I was fired, I would be a liar, if I said I wouldn’t feel blessed.

Cause this job causes, so much stress 

And this anxiety causin’ distress

I’m not ok when, I’m depressed 
I’m not ok when, I’m a mess."
6,Normality of light and dark,When I was the little the sun and I where to say neutral but as I got older the more it annoyed me. I’ve always had mental health issues from biological parents and when with my step-mother it’s as though I have to walk on egg shells. But there is one place they wouldn’t go and that’s the darkness so I’ve always found happiness from the darkness it makes me feel great and alive like a burst of adrenaline. My parents say it is the reason I am depressed cause I never get sun and I’m always light headed I can’t argue with the light headed but that is also from blood related issues. My parents are always mad at me when I am in the darkness then when they invade my darkness and turn on the lights I lose control over my emotions I’ll either cry uncontrollably or when someone gets close to me I immediately prepare for a fight without control. I don’t know how to make my parents happy and be happy at the same time. I’ve tried to explain it. To me the darkness is like the sun to other humans. Am I weird?
7,What is Your Power Level?,"hey my name is Malvin9K im
new to the communty a host a mental health Podcast called The Power Level Podcast! this podcast is all about the mind and how people use power within themselves to overcome
obstacles in life. i am looking to speak with guest specifically on an upcoming episode about abuse, addiction or talk to any[power Level Podcast ](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-power-level-podcast/id1504024604) psychiatrist or doctors. if you know any one  or if youre interested please message me."
8,Do I really need help?,"The last couple of days I've been a bit disturbed due to something I did while I was drunk. Do I really need help? 

The question comes since the last time I got drunk it seems I just decided out of nowhere cut my self, superficially, I didn't mean to reach a vein or something as far as I remember, I don't really know what was I thinking since in general I feel pretty happy, complete and there are no suicidal or depressive feelings/thoughts while sober but still I feel a bit worried about that. However it is important to mention that I use to do stupid thinks while I'm not sober since I have done pretty dumb things in the past, not that.. umm, serious i guess, so some advice would be great, I personally decided to just go on and continue with my life as if nothing happened but I'm still interested on what other people would think of that situation."
9,I wanna die. No one would care,I have my voices in my head telling me every time that I'm worthless and a shit head. Its true and it hurts me very much. Sometimes I cut my wrists to fell something other than internal pain. Trade for a Trade. I cannot kill myself. Im too much of a pussy to kill myself. I dont wanna suffer anymore. I dont want my parents and siblings to know I'm mentally ill. I dont want to soil the family name. I tried to do everything like counselling and making up imaginary people to help with my struggles. I cannot deal with this. Im hiding all my pain. I wish I cut deeper. I wish my vape exploded on me. I wish for sweet release. Please dont tell my family or anyone important as this would ruin my life and the family name
10,I’m so tired,
11,Why do i feel like id be safer on a planet without the same air i breathe,"I swear to god, im tired of watching people die, i cant even browse the internet without seeing a dude get shot 20 times in the head, and its starting to affect how i feel about real life, just like one of my previous posts i cant help but to think that something so horrible could happen to anyone i love just because they were walking down the street or going to the store, or hell just staying in there own fucking home, the only place that feels safe is a place where humans dont exist, why the FUCK are we so violent, i dont feel safe, i dont feel like the people i care for are safe, im terrified"
12,Should I go to hospital,I’ve been having panic attacks all day and I don’t have anything to take to calm me down. My chest has felt weird all day and occasionally my vision goes blurry
13,How a single memory ends my positivite mental health steak,"tl;dr i have had daily panic attacks for a couple years now. Recentl, after finally distancing myself from my biggest sources of anxiety and finding a working ish lifestyle routine for my mental health, I'm starting to see results in the depresson and anxiety. And i want to point out i fully intend to continue that. However..

This week: as one of my best productive weeks I've had in a long time. This weekend: hey, remember that one time at a sleep over you felt so personally rejected by your friends that you couldn't sleep and spent the entire night and into the morning in their kitchen with a knife in your hand trying work up the courage to finally end it? 

Oh, that was almost fifteen years ago and this is the first time you remembered it in your entire adult life? 

Having these kind of memories come back in this way fully puts me in the emotional state of the memory . The rejection, self loathing, injustice. I've been sick to my stomach, boarderine panic attack since it surfaced. 

Why does my brain hold on to this stuff so well? It's like my brain sees that I'm recovered from the last recurring episode and decides now is the best time to heal the next one.

Edit: metal health steak sounds pretty good right now"
14,The news has been exhausting,Does anyone else feel mentally exhausted by all that’s been going on since the start of the new year ? I almost feel like I don’t wanna keep up with what’s going on for a while. Opinions ?
15,Caffeine,"Does anyone else have the problem where sometimes caffeine works the way it should, and the other times makes you very sleepy? I'm not sure if it's my anxiety but it's something I've noticed for a while."
16,Surprisingly Helpful,"I was searching for something that would make me feel good about the world, or about humanity in general, which I have been having trouble with lately. I've posted here under other accounts before, and I know a lot of folks here are probably struggling with seeing disturbing posts everywhere on the internet. For some reason, I was compelled to go to r/dataisbeautiful and I found this clever interactive animation/game about human behavior. It really shifted my mood. Here it is:

[https://ncase.me/trust/](https://ncase.me/trust/)

I think that right now, if you're like me, you don't really want to open up facebook, youtube, or even tiktok and see evidence of the craziness that humans are capable of. Those of us that struggle with mental health need to remind ourselves that we can't control most of what goes on. But, you can control what you allow yourself to watch, read, and listen to. Right now, you need to feel in control of your life. Do your dishes, take a shower, stretch, masturbate, do whatever you need to do to control what you can in your life. You don't have to stay up to date on the news every day. Your ""wokeness"" is not a priority. Being ""right"" about politics is not a priority. Doing the right thing is contingent upon your own health and security, so do what you can to take care of yourself instead of trying to point out and attack the things that are wrong with the world."
17,What do yous do to not feel shitty allmost of the time?,It's been getting harder for me by the day... Just wanted to know what gets everyone through the day..
18,How do I check myself into a psychiatric hospital?,I'm STRAIGHT UP perceiving the world differently and tried to end my life. I'm not actively suicidal but I'm at such a low point where I can't keep living like this? I really think I need a diagnosis in order to help myself but I'm only 22 and mental hospitals have such a stigma I feel like I need to be criminally insane to be admitted. How did you/do you get admitted?
19,"Tentatively Sharing This With The World, Hope It Helps",[deleted]
20,Strong attachment to teacher formed while suicidal,"At the end of 2018 (September) a new school year began for me. I was severely depressed, anxious and suicidal. I had a very serious self harm issue that helped me keep my suicidal thoughts and plans in my head, instead of fulfilling them. Just to mention, my mother walked out on me when young so the attachment formed was with a female teacher.

I walked into an English class with this particular teacher and I just felt like I could trust her. She was open with the class and I appreciated it. My family was falling apart so I looked up to her. Dumb teenager admiration. Honestly, I was the student in the class to laugh at everything. Typically right? For a depressed teenager to try to laugh away the sadness.

In December 2018, I had cried in front of her due to stress from home. And at first, I felt like I could trust her, she was the first teacher ever to show me empathy instead of pity. So she was mostly a backup plan. A person who I knew I could go to if my thoughts became become tangible.

In February 2019, I had a panic attack in front of her and she helped me. I guess that's when it developed fully. The thought of 'If I kill myself, I won't be able to see Ms......'

And it made me form a very strong attachment to her, just wanting to be near her so I felt safe. It sounds very stupid, I know, but it was the only thing keeping me going. It was like I had to earn her affections and acknowledgements. My friends and family only spoke to out of duty, it felt like.

I thought about her all the time but when I was actually near her, I was a bumbling mess. Completely ridden with anxiety and guilt of disturbing her. 

Later in the year, I confided in her about self harm and suicidal thoughts and a little bit later, the abusive relationship I had with my dad. I had a few breakdowns in front of her.  

There is so much more she did for me but if I write it all, then It'd take too long to read. This is just the gist.

\-

We are still close and I go to her when I need help

But I need advice on how to become less attached with her. This is so I can move on. But its like I can't let go no matter how much I want to."
21,How to stop myself from self sabotaging?,"I've been trying to get rid of alcohol abuse and self depreciating thoughts for a few years now. The fight had ups and downs but in the end the situation can be summarized by moments of great optimism, courage and will to get better followed by moments of extreme self sabotaging, weakness and recklessness towards my goals and finally a feeling of frustration that gets bigger every time the cycle is complete.

It's like when my mind asks for the addiction, it will make me think any kind of excuse to surrender. ""Everybody is drinking on the isolation anyway, its not a big deal"", ""you're young and healthy, if there is a time to drink a lot, it is now"", ""all the musicians and characters you like also drink, you need to be just like them"". Stupid. Things like this, that are so stupid when I think about them in a sane state it gets me embarrassed sharing it.

But I need advice. How do I stop this voice, this ""me"" that convinces me to give up my fight to become healthy? I try and try, but I can't seem to be strong enough to think strait when the abstinence hits.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if I made any english mistakes, I'm from Brazil. And thanks a lot if you read this."
22,How do you knew you needed therapy?,"I've been thinking a lot about it, but I don't know if what I feel is just some phase of my life (I'm a 23yo guy), some bad time or I truly have some mental problems and I need help to carry on. I think I'm not in a desperate case, so I thought I can try to ask about around here. This is my first reddit post, btw, so I'm so sorry for my bad English."
23,Any HSP to help me?,"I became aware not a long time ago that I'm a High Sensitive Person, and all the implications that come with this. I'm struggling because I feel to much for my family and friends, and I can't seem to prioritize what I want. That's making me feel nervous, nauseous, and mostly, anxious. Explaining real quick:  I decided today after two months staying with my parents that I am going back to my own house (they asked me to come back during quarantine, I didn't wanted to but did it for them). Now I'm feeling a complete garbage because I can't just take myself away from their own problems. My mom had a depression relapse because of home office, and I'm depressed and anxious as well, and I feel sometimes  absorve too much other's feelings. I had a lot of suicidal thoughts ans even tried to kill myself another night, so I know I have to do this for my own safety. But everytime I think about me leaving, I feel like my mom's mental health depends on me, and I start feeling sick for real, loose appetite and even vomit. I just don't know how to untangle my feelings from other's feelings, and I could use some help. Feel like I'm going to explode"
24,I’m feeling pretty down about myself today. Not sure what to do. Can anyone help me out with some advice?,"

Hey everyone. Please read until the end. I know it’s long but bare with me. I’ve (20M) felt like shit for about a week. For some context I suffer from a few anxiety disorders and depression. I’ve gotten 85% or it under control to the point that people outside wouldn’t notice. Anyway, I’ve been trying to date for a while and have dated around. I’m looking for a serious relationship, as I’m not into the whole smash and dash thing. I want to love someone and be loved. Well, my ex broke up with me in March and got engaged to a guy in April that she dated for only 3 weeks. This crushed me. Although she never touched me, we still loved each other (we were both rape survivors which is why we never touched each other. I’m not triggered by physical stuff though) Since then I’ve tried to date two different women. One strung me along for 6 weeks. The other one was too wild for me but I stuck around for a bit because she was very good looking. Well, that ended badly and I’m at my wits end. I feel like I’m in a corner. I’m going to stop online dating, because that doesn’t work for me. I just feel so alone. I hate the single life. I miss having someone to share my life with. Someone to take around the country with me. I’ve worked on myself. I’ve gotten and finished Invisalign. I’m 6’1”. I have blond hair. I’m not obese (though I could lose a few pounds). I’m a computer scientist whose almost done with my degree. Im about to get plastic surgery on my chest. I have improved my social skills to the Point that I can shamelessly say anything. But I don’t know whats not to love. I get flirted with but it’s always women who put me on their endless list of phone numbers. I just feel like shit. Any advice?"
25,"Same medication, different results","My girlfriend and I take the same medication (Lovan 20mg) and I recently ran out of my prescription and my GP isn't in for a while so she has been giving me some of hers. Could there be any reason why they may not be working on me? Everything is the exact same eg. Medication, what it contains, the dosage. It just seems like I'm getting worse each passing day it's not a long term solution by any means but it did peak my interest as maybe because I know they aren't my own pills that I've been taking for 3 years maybe my brain has a placebo kind of effect? I'm not too sure, if anyone knows let me know please"
26,My therapy needs to talk to my guardian before putting me on meds. Does anyone know the type of questions they'll ask?,My guardian is my sister. I recently emailed my therapist because I felt like shit and started cutting myself and having bad thoughts. She's since checked in on me and I have a virtual appointment with my sister to discuss medication. Does anyone know how invasive they get with the questions? There's stuff I tell my therapist that I don't want my sister to know so I want to be prepared
27,How can I help myself?,"Many mental health problems run on my father’s side from schizophrenia / bipolar / more, the genetics are very unhealthy.

I do not believe in therapy, it is irritating to talk about nothing.

I have gone to a psychiatrist and she told me medicine is experimental - what works for one may not work for another.

The number one problem with me is that I get told constantly my social interactions with people are very strange.

I tend to talk too much, talk over people, my memory isn’t very good...  

The reason why this is an issue is everyone I talk to thinks I am weird or on drugs (like I am on cocaine)...

I have tried:

Low dose (.5) of risperdal and this helped slightly but had a horrible effect on me making me very tired and it isn’t practical 

I have tried prozac, nothing.  Zyprexa, nothing.  

Lexipro seemed to work but lost a job and could not get access to this drug anymore...

I want to try ADHD FDA approved drugs."
28,How can i love and forgive my dad who used to beat me as a child ?,"This may not be the right group to post this in but my theropist has told me that he thinks my depression and  anxiety was caused because of the trauma I suffered when I was younger when my parents used to hit me alot 

I'm 33 now and have never been close to my parents iv not once told them I loved them and I just want to forgive them but I can't forget the memory's of what I seen and been threw when I was a child 

I just want to forget them and move on with my life, when i question my dad about it in the past he said he did it because that's all he knew how to do,

 does anyone have any idea how I can move on  and maybe find love for my parents ?"
29,i hate having autism and bpd. why even live?,"# 

# For the last 2 years, i've been in total isolation. away from people. I basically disappeared from the world. lost every friendship/relationship i had. i'm 21 and i'm sitting in the fucking house all day. away from people bc im ""weird"" bc of my style of clothing and my odd mannerisms. and bc i'm so afraid of rejection i don't even try. 

# and when i'm out, i don't wanna look at people bc they might make a face at me that puts me on edge. like they see me below them.

# i feel unwelcomed EVERYWHERE i go and feel like everyone hates me to the point to where i feel like i have to up the anti and do things, hurt myself, be extremely promiscuous just to be seen and throw myself into these garbage ass situations where everyone will hate me in the end. 

# cant even use social media anymore bc that exact same situation happens there too. Even if someone doesn't like my posts, it's enough to trigger my bpd and send me on a total bitch fit.

I'm a bitch, i'm a retard, I'm toxic, i'm an attention whoring cunt. I don't know if i just need a friend, someone to talk to, someone that just needs to not sit in the house all the time or if i'm just a narcissist that wants to feed off of attention. i don't know i'm the cause of all my problems in relationships. i don't know if i'm so delusional that i can't see any other prospective besides me being a victim. I'm always in total confusion.

I'm fucking tired of this life. i just wish i could be normal. i wish i could not obsess into my hobbies. I wish i could give eye contact to people when i talk to them, i hate the fact it's hard to get any job bc of how awkward i come off during interviews, 

wish i didn't flip out every time i got left on read and someone didn't txt me back. i hate how i cut people off the minute they seemed like they had the potential to abandon me. I wish i could be a fucking tolerable human being. why even live when im being starved by what makes me human? i need to be social like everyone else but it's like everyone hates me. I'm so fucking done. i seriously think i wanna end my life. bc it's not like there's a cure for having illnesses"
30,Why am I not dead yet,I had like 10mg of lorazepam or more idk Like 80mg of escitalopram and as mentioned above idk might b more and like TONS of clonazepam. I’m drinking alcohol in a hot back too. Self harming has always been there so kind of bleeding out my thighs but the real question is why am I not dead yet. I tried oding on just lorazepam twice and it didn’t work so I tried all the fucking mixture I can find. Any help
31,"serious mental health issues all my life(depression has been a constant, all sorts of panic attacks, etc.) But I found something the other day. *Long read*","So I’ve been pretty athletic my whole life, used to play soccer basically my whole young adult life. But after high school I started smoking, drinking, taking any and all drugs all the time, I worked out but I never got anywhere aside from bigger muscles. I was ignorant, never put a label on much of my pain up until the other day. I’ve been a consistent addict with one thing or another, and I’ve always just been a scared, sad, extremely introverted person. I live on my own and have for the past year. 

I live in a college town so there’s plenty to do but while I pursue music as my career and i choose to not do anything besides work and do that. I’m 22, I haven’t gone out, gone to bars, I can’t talk to any even semi attractive girls, I get super tense walking through Walmart or crowded places, it’s because I’ve been judged so much my whole life, I always over think, and think anyone that interacts with me judges me as soon as they leave. 

I’ve played the persona that I’m tough, that I can handle anything, that I have a fuck everybody mentality but it just isn’t true, I get scared, I freak out in intense conflict and I can’t breathe in a heated argument. I was a pussy. A lot of it comes from my alcoholic mother who, for my whole childhood, chose the bar over me, and when I wanted time with her I got screamed at because of it. 

But, 3 weeks ago, I finally went through with it, I decided I didn’t want to be afraid anymore,  of anyone, or anything. I wanted to look my panic and depression and fear and weakness in its face and beat it. So I started running, and also taking very cold showers for a very long time. I’ve done both those things before but I always became inconsistent and inevitably stopped after a month at most. 

But I decided no more, I couldn’t spend my life this afraid, because something has always never been afraid inside of me, but I’ve never even tried to see it, maybe it’s because of my fear , maybe it’s the fear I have of having to go through my own purposeful suffering. 

I’ve ran and taken a cold shower consistently for 3 weeks so far. Started with 1 mile the first day, and about a 3 minute cold shower. I kept going up in miles and time in the cold shower. I realized an issue tho, I always stopped before the work even started. So I ran further, I sat in the cold until I was losing my mind convinced I was going to die. And then today came..... 

I decided I wanted to get an answer , about anything, so it was super hot, and I ran, and I ran and I ran and I ran, after about two miles I thought I was literally going to fall over and die of heat stroke, Mile 3 I had to puke and I was spacing out because of the heat, I’ve been running 4 miles everyday so I  said “it’s not worth dying to get an answer, so started heading back home” and then I said “no, otherwise nothing will change” I kept running, Mile 4 my legs were really heavy and pounding the pavement, it was like that for the next couple miles with the same convo happening in my head. “ go home” “no” yes no yes no 

Upon Mile 8, now pay attention. I KNEW I wasn’t going to be Able to keep running all the way home, I was going to have to walk, but about .5 miles till my front door, I got an answer and here it is. (Sorry for the long post btw) 

I’ve convinced myself of who I am, without even attempting to see what I’m capable of. That I’m only afraid bc deep down, this is what I was capable of, that even tho I thought I KNEW I couldn’t make it with over a mile to go.. I made it, but yet I KNEW I couldn’t, so how do I KNOW that I’m afraid? How do I KNOW I’m introverted? How do I KNOW I’m afraid of conflict. How do I KNOW I’m afraid of fear. How do I KNOW anything without trying, really, really, know... and I guess if I’m being honest I’m still afraid, but I’m a little less afraid now, but I’m going to continue to try and try to be less afraid and really know who I am. Thats what I figured out, is though that moment didnt work a miracle or my life is suddenly different. But then again maybe it did, because now I know what I need to do, I need to try."

33,"why can’t i(f17) do simple things? like pay attention, not forget things, and not lack motivation?","i feel so fucking dumb because i can’t do little, normal things that my whole family/friends/boyfriend thinks i should be able to do. i don’t pay attention even when i try hard to stay focus. i forget things easily even when i’m reminded of them. i lack motivation which creates a chain affect to my day to day life and it’s not beneficial to me. 

i constantly zone out when i drive, causing me to miss turns/exits. 

i constantly make the same mistakes over and over again, but i don’t do it purposefully. i don’t understand why i don’t learn the first few times from my mistakes. it’s frustrating. trying my hardest seems like little to no effort to those around me. it’s always “well if you try harder, if you just listened, if you just got your shit together you’d do this”. 

“maybe if you woke up earlier”, well getting out of bed isn’t always easy. 

“if you try harder”, well i’m trying my fucking hardest and you telling me to try harder makes me feel worthless. 

“just get your shit together”, i’m trying, i promise!! 

and no these aren’t fucking excuses, this is me struggling. i am struggling and i’m afraid to reach out for help because i feel like i’m going to get the same “it shouldn’t be that difficult for you to just ______”. 

any advice? or anyone with similar struggles? part of me believes i may have mild adhd but i hate self diagnosing. just a thought? any advice for those who have untreated adhd and can’t get medication for it?"
34,I'm not happy.,"GUYSS

Please stop cheating on people...

Even if it's online...

I gave my heart to this person. He has my heart..... and just repeatedly stomps on it.... 

&amp;#x200B;

Im not fucking ok. I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel stuck."
35,"I have an embarrassing problem, any ideas what is wrong with me?",I have been like this for years. I always convince myself I need to pee. I am not sure what to do at this point. It affects me daily (not bad during lockdown). If there is a long car journey I will go to the toilet 5 times 15 minutes before leaving. I go to the toilet way more than the average person should and I don’t understand why. I have sent a urine sample to get tested and it came back clear so it must be something in my head.
36,I feel like I'm losing my grip on reality,"Apologies in advance for the long post. I never thought I'd have to post somewhere like here, but I don't know what to do anymore.

Seeing how things are going in the world today... it's hard to hold on to the belief that things will get better. People just don't seem to care about others. I get that lockdown is impacting everyone differently. People want their freedom back. But why are we, as a species, so weak that we're willing to effectively kill people for our own emotional state?

Compound unto this the riots going on right now, which are not only highlighting the ugly truth that the US has, and likely always will be, fundamentally divided, but providing another vector for the disease to spread, and I find it hard to have the willpower to keep going. It's over. We lost. We're doomed to keep hating each other and consequentially marching closer to our inevitable demise, for that's how we've always operated.

The scary thing, I realize, is that I know the last two paragraphs are an extreme of what's going on in the world. I feel like I'm stuck in my own head, this echo chamber of despair. That the world is ending, when it may not be. But I could also be going crazy, I guess.

To pay for school, I go to a manufacturing job every day with people seemingly apathetic towards the state of the world. I've seen the way all of my coworkers are dismissive towards anything I say. I'm pretty sure that they all hate me, and to some extent, I've fortunately stopped caring for their opinions. Nobody likes talking to the kid who doesn't fit the narrative of ""go to work, go home and watch sports and drink, repeat it all the next day"". Nobody cares to learn about people different than them. Nobody cares to face the reality of what's going on. Rather than discussing how we can help the world, we pretend the problems don't exist.

I feel like school is the only real structure in my life, but even hopes for that are looking slim for the Fall. I just joined a team helping to develop open-source respirator equipment, but that brings me back to my original question- can we really beat this? How many people are going to die? How many people I love are going to die? And why does nobody care?

None of this feels real. I don't know what's going to happen going forward. I think, for the first time in my life, I feel true terror. 

I don't want baseless reassurance from friends and family. I want solutions. I want some way to protect the people I care about and those who can't afford to protect themselves, and if that's not possible, part of me just wants someone to put a bullet in my head so that I don't need to look at this selfish society ever again.

Thank you for reading. Even just writing it all out here helps a bit."
37,I feel like I’m this close to my mind splitting at the seams some days,"Other days I’m fine. I don’t understand what is happening, or why I’ve been so impulsive lately. Some days I wake up hating myself, other days I wake up and love myself. It changes by the week. Can’t think clearly, the news is killing me and I want to escape, yet at the same time escaping feels wrong when I know that others can’t disassociate the way I can. Feeling like I’m just losing it in general. Having a low moment today, but hoping that tomorrow will be brighter."
38,Idk what I have. I'm always anxious and always triggered.,"For a fact I know that I have anxiety. But idk if I only have that. It all started when I was forced to choose a career path against my will and it came with a lot of struggle. I've been struggling since 4 years now with no luck. I'm unemployed still. I have not given up though I will struggle until I succeed. But my mental health is on a rocky road. I get sever anxiety attacks at times and I cry and cry for days at a time. In the back of my mind I'm always sad. Little things trigger me, little changes bother the hell out of me. 
I can't afford a psychiatrist rn and there's no one I can talk to. So I'm just venting here. Please be nice. ❤"
39,I feel like I’m losing the one person I got myself to reach out to.,It hurts a lot
40,I feel like I have to change who I am depending on who I talk to.,"Title says it all.  I feel as if depending on who I talk to, I have to be a different person.  When I'm with friends I'm the jokester or the clown if you will.  When im with my family I'm the annoying but loving middle child with a bit of charm and a complete mommas boy.  When it's just me and my dad, I tend to be more curious about things like how certain processes work or hypotheticals about stuff that I think would be useful to know.  When I'm in class without any friends I'm the quiet and reserved ""speak when spoken to"" type.  But most importantly, when I'm by myself I feel empty.  I get bored very easily and have severe emotional numbness and want to be constantly isolated.  I constantly feel like a spectator in my own life and never really feel happy for the great life I live.  I feel like I'm a story without any real importance, and without purpose.  I constantly feel like I'm out of my own skin and never wanting to do anything unless I'm told to or to just pass the time with menial subjects like tv and videogames.  Does anyone else have this problem, or any solutions?  I feel incredibly self conscious but I'm never able to show it, hence why I just try to blend in with everything.  Only on a few occasions have I felt the need to grab everyone's attention.  All of those were because I find nothing else.... exciting."

43,"Dieting to cope with feelings, can it be healthy?",I've started doing Intermittent fasting. I'm at the biggest weight I've ever been and my blood pressure is up. At times I enjoy not eating. It helps keep my mind on other things. Plus I was  recently flooded out of my home and making or finding a meal can be real stressful. I say that fasting is good for my mental health but I'm not sure.
44,Should I confirm that I have clinical depression on employment applications?,Some applications have these questions. They say it won't affect possible employment. Should I trust it?
45,"I kind of need someone to talk to? It’s not that emotional(it’s actually a bit of the opposite), I just kind of need it off my chest.","Reddit is the most logical place for this because Instagram and Twitter seem to be filled with people who don’t know a lot and tend to make big assumptions. I don’t want to post it because I may be judged because of it. I just need one person to chat with.

46,"Life has always been as dark as it is right now, I'm just done.","Whenever I go through a rough patch I just stop all my thoughts and tell myself everything seems so bleak because my mind is playing games with me and covering all the good parts of life, and that it's stoping me from seeing the hole picture...but not today, not really. I've been thinking a lot about my professional future lately, im in America right now but I have to go back to Brazil in 6 Months and I live on a small city, I just feel helpless, damned if I do college because there is no chance of me actually being successful in that City and obviously damned If I don't do college because I'm not a special snowflake I don't even know the bare minimum about music to actually make good music and even if I did, that's not enough on top of making actual good music I would need to get lucky and be noticed by big guys. Honestly I can't shake suicide out of my mind right now, I've never had a time in my life where I didn't hate myself even as a kid I fucking hated me for not being smart as all the other kids, man... Fuck Andre I just want him gone man... A damn waste of time, money and skin I am."
47,Quarintine has messed up my mental health and my good grades,"Uhh I don't know if this belongs here or not but I need help and I don't know what subreddit to post this on, also sorry for bad spelling and grammar, I'm dyslexic. Ever since quarintine started my mental health rapidly declined. At first it was a relief as I didn't have so much stress to get school work done and other things but now its out of control.

Every time I try to even look at what school work I have I get really agitiated, figitey and frustrated which leads me to not doing any work. This has never happened before and I'm normally really quick to do my work and I'm one of the nerdy people and my school but this has gone on for 4 weeks now and shows no signs of stopping. I havent been able to face any work for 4 weeks and I am now behind in all my subjects and my courseworks, anyone have any ideas what the fudge is going on or how to help? Please?

Edit: I'd also like to add that as a bookworm I can't stand reading atm or anything else apart from going on my phone and laptop as it requires waaayyy too much mental effort at the moment. "
48,How can I help?,"I am a medical student and my preference for speciality training is Psychiatry. A lot of people say it is not a good career choice but it is my passion. I have never been diagnosed with anything because I never sought medical help but I have faced bullying, abuse, contemplated suicide, suffered from low self esteem issues stemming from my porn addiction. I want to ask as medical personnel how can we improve our conduct towards mental health? and not only as a medical worker but generally as a human too."
49,"I’m [F26] living with regrets, jealousy, and misery. I have few motivations left.","Hello friends! Here’s a little background about me.

I had very good early childhood until my parents were divorced when I was 5. Even though I was the lucky kid since I could get to spend time with my mom and dad everyday until I turned 18,  Ive been experiencing bullying not only by peers, especially boys, but also teachers. I’ve been having mental issues since childhood, and I’ve been always wanting to be normal just like everyone else, especially when I was in special ed class until high school. When I was 8, my dad married to my first stepmother (not anymore thankfully), and she hates me since day 1. She claimed that she’s a Christian, but I was extremely abused by her. I had, still have, hard time making friends through my K-12 years, and I had no choice but to be someone I’m not. I started to please people, and I don’t get to know who I really am. I’ve been overweight my lifetime, and because of this, I was bullied terribly by boys which caused me to never trust guys nor make guy friends. Thus, I never had a boyfriend until I was 18, still single as of now. I chose the wrong college major, as I should’ve majored in computer science instead of psychology. I have a part time job, and I’ve been looking for full time but no offer, nor given an interview. I don’t have a driver’s license, but I have a learner’s permit. My mom refused to let me practice driving with her ever since I turned 16. I can’t afford driving lessons, no family wants to help me get licensed, and I refused to stay over my dad’s since we’re estranged due to having conflicts with my current stepmother. Recently, I’ve become more jealous of almost everyone’s success, especially when my niece [17] gotten her driver’s license last year [16], which I should’ve gotten mines way before her, not the other way around. I can’t get Medicaid since where I live doesn’t expand it. I’ve been wanting to seek therapy and get medications from psychiatrist, but I can’t afford it. In addition, I have no goals, therefore I suck at saving money. I’ve been fooled by man, who I thought was the one, ghosted me since we hooked up last month. I still have trust issues with everyone, including myself. I refused to accept compliments because I’m so used to getting criticized. When a guy calls me beautiful, I would tell him that I don’t believe him because I  would think that he’s being insincere. I don’t necessarily have suicidal thoughts, but I’m depressed because I missed out on every opportunity I should’ve taken in my entire lifetime. I’ve been living with regrets, jealousy, and misery because all of these terrifying events prevents me from changing myself and focusing on present.

Please do not judge me because I’ve been judged hard enough."
50,I am afraid of sleeping.,"While the thought of dying while asleep or having nightmares is scary, neither of those are the main reasons I'm afraid of it.

It's simply the fact that when you sleep, you are unconscious. You are no longer there. It's incomprehensible, and I think that's why I am so afraid of it. It's like being dead, but only for 8 hours.

Usually it just keeps me awake from anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, and I eventually get so tired I don't really care anymore and stop thinking about it. I usually don't have trouble staying asleep either.

Last night though, I just couldn't get myself to sleep. I ended up falling asleep at 10 in the morning, ironically after I decided to just wait till the next night to sleep.

This whole thing has been really bothering me. The thought of being unconscious is terrifying to me, not because you could die during it or anything, but just the fact that I'm gone during sleep. 

It's a pretty new problem, it's only been going on for a week or two. When I was younger (I'm 17 right now) I used to deal with insomnia, but that was years ago and I've never really had an issue with sleep since then.

Part of it is I assume due to my completely fucked up sleep schedule; I usually fall asleep at 6 AM and wake up at 4 PM. This started pretty much because since the start of the quarantine."
51,Everything is nuts. I'm not sure how much more stress I can take.,"Between work, schoolwork, COVID-19, and the rioting, I'm over my limit. There is so much happening and I wish it would all stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have tips for me to help deal with everything? My county just started a curfew tonight."
52,0 motivation to do anything,"That feel when your are tired of being tired, losing interest of doing a lot of things i liked. Any help or tip to become more passional about things?"
53,i hate everything about myself,"yes, i mean everything. i can’t look in the mirror or i start to tear up . my only moods anymore are sad or numb. (tw right here so yeah caution) the past few days i’ve been close to relapsing. i hate my personality i’m too antisocial i can’t stand people at all. i’d rather die alone then just deal with them. i’m overly sensitive i breakdown at any kinda of criticism or the thought of hurting someone else or them disliking me. i don’t really have any friends cause i push them away. i try asking for medication for my anxiety but i’m just told i don’t actually need it and they disregard it. sorry if anything doesn’t make since this is really just a rant but support would really help i’m not used to speaking out or anything so i apologize if it is weird or awkward thanks for reading"
54,I had to leave a job again because of my depression and anxiety.,"Quarantine was really great for me. I didn’t have to work but one dayy a week. I was able to actually relax, do some gardening, and just take care of my home and myself.
Once i got back to work full time at the optical shop/optometry clinic i worked in, it was insane busy every day and my manager left leaving me as the only optician in this busy practice. It triggered my illness and i just kept leaving or calling in sick because i just couldn’t take dealing with and being around so many people.
Now i’m unemployed, like many, but i can’t stay that way for long.
I need to find something that i can handle that won’t require me to be so extraverted all day long. I like to be busy but not overwhelmed 5 days a week. I have a masters in social work but that ship has sailed. Does anyone struggling with these issues have any suggestions? Maybe share what type of job worked for you? I’d appreciate ideas so much."
55,I finally told my mom about my symptoms and I’m so damn proud of myself,"This is kinda random but I just need to tell someone. I’ve been having OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) symptoms since I was young but never thought anything of it until recently. I knew I was a little different and thought differently but like most thought that OCD meant you wanna be clean and away from germs all the time. My symptoms make me feel guilt for inanimate objects like food crumbs or rocks or even numbers some times. I also feel like I always have to move my body a certain way like clear my throat when there’s nothing to clear or most of the time move my shoulders and head in circles or side to side. I really hate it. 

Earlier on when I researched OCD, I felt kinda alone so I decided to tell my dad about it. It did not go well. He just laughed about it and then told my stepmom and they kept denying it and saying it was all in my head. For a while I did believe it was all in my head. I felt like I had a burden on me until today. I was feeling really bad so I took some extra time in the shower to just be alone. I had completely forgotten that I promised my mom I would go downstairs and hang out with her after a “quick shower”. I was in the shower for probably about an hour. She was really mad because she though I just didn’t want to hang out with her. I literally just burst out crying. At this point we were both mad so we took some time and then talked. That’s when I told her about the OCD symptoms I’ve been experiencing. She was super chill about it and I had nothing to be afraid of in the first place. We are going to do more research because I definitely want to get properly diagnosed. I feel better than I have in a long time. Please send prayers or good vibes that all will be well &lt;3 😊"
56,Vent: late night thoughts about future,"I’m just terrified of the future and to even do something to pursue my dreams. I really want to be a singer and although I’m not good at it, I really want to learn. For some reason I’m embarrassed to talk about it and can’t tell my family that’s what I want to do. My family simply would not be able to afford singing lessons for me and I’m scared about my future and if I will ever truly be happy. I’m not happy. Quarantine is pretty great since I love being inside but lacking privacy now that my siblings are home from college and I really just need more privacy and confidence. I have been working out which has helped me but the space I have for it has been stressing me out since it’s not clean or large. I just have things in my mind I can’t get over and I’m so scared it’s getting to late to do anything."
57,I'm scared,"I'm 18F and it's my first time living on my own. And I started realizing that I don't have many friends. I just feel so useless and like nobody like me or wants me in their life. I'm scared of being alone. I don't want to be alone. When I was younger, I never thought I would make it to my 18 years old so I literally have nothing planned for my future. Being an adult is scary, I don't want to be an adult. My depression and anxiety are so bad right now. I'm scared of myself"
58,anyone else the therapist friend?,i cant go a day without helping someone. that’s what i’m known for in my friend group- the one who’s there to help. but how am i supposed to help others when i cant even help myself. i cant get out of my bed in the morning yet i’m expected to take care of everyone and everything. it’s draining. i’m so tired. i just want to be taken care of.
59,Tired 24/7,"I assume I’m not the only one, but...are you guys tired all the time? Like not just “Oh, I wish I could relax today”, but more like *sits/lies down for 30 seconds and is asleep*? I can’t think or do any kind of physical activity, it doesn’t even have to be strenuous. When I even think about doing assignments or reading, I get soooooo tired. I’m 19 and as my classes get harder, it becomes harder to keep up with work. I have been diagnosed with moderate anxiety and depression, but also asthma and mild anemia. I am currently trying to see different doctors about fatigue-related medical conditions. I also have extreme “brain fog”. I used to be really good about memorizing things and critical thinking, but now I could set down my phone and then lose it 2 seconds later. I’m so young, I shouldn’t have this much loss of cognitive function. When I was a child, maybe 9 or 10, I was known to be “that nerdy kid” that was super into reading and knew all sorts of random facts and was going to be a scientist someday. I was also considered naturally talented at music and the arts. WHAT HAPPENED? Yeah, I hated school and studying, but it’s not like I neglected training my brain. I still loved reading and researching and analyzing things (which I would do in my free time). The only difference to me is that I would actually care about the subject. However, I digress. I still love reading, but whenever I open a book or my Kindle, I get so tired just thinking about it that I close it and take a nap. If you ask me to do something off the top of my head, I blank and then cry because I get embarrassed. I’ve started to think I’m just incredibly stupid because I can’t do anything without being tired. I’m mentally burnt out and I don’t know how to recover. I’m just wondering if this is a condition? I heard about chronic fatigue syndrome and it sounds similar, but I don’t know what to do for that. Any advice or suggestions on how to help?

TL:DR any kind of conscious brain activity makes me tired- thinking, reading, talking etc. I’ve avoided so many things I like because I don’t want to feel any more tired than I already do. I have severe “brain fog” which is impacting the quality of my work and my quality of life, but I don’t know how to fix it or who to go to."
60,I just want someone to hear me.,"I desperately need someone to hear me for once, just hear me and listen and not make it about themselves or tell me what I’m upset about is stupid or tell me I’m not trying hard enough. I want someone to just tell me that they understand what I’m saying or to tell me that everything will be ok. I just want someone to sympathize with me for once and not tell me I’m having a pity party or ignore me."
61,Double takes,"I've never told anyone this.

When I was little I useto see what I can knly know describe as complete hallucinations. They went away, and trust me I know the difference between imagination and hallucinations. I would hear people whispering and I would see literal monsters, and without a double take could stare at them and see them run away etc.. I would have paranoia as well. I dont feel like I need to go into ultra detail.

Over time it went away, and I've never had anything like that above the age of 9 or so. Being a child most my claims of monsters were always laughed at, and it wasn't a super big deal anyway, so it was never seriously investigated. 

For these reasons I was terrified of the dark. And have been for years. I would still have paranoid episodes of thinking people are following me etc. Or there is a monster trying to kill me, but no straight up hallucinations, just shadow figures etc., and I was like this until about 16. This started to wither away and I lost my fear of the darkness.

At 18 years old now, I still see things at night and have paranoid thoughts, but am able to recognize that I'm just being a retard. But I've noticed that I've began to have an increasing amount of double takes, and not obvious ones either. Its to the point where its almost every 5 minutes. I'll think a mailbox is a person, i will hear instruments playing at night. This kind of stuff."
62,Emotional Neglect?,Im beginning to think that i May have been emotionally neglected as a child. I don’t really remember much honestly. When i think childhood i can only think of my elementary days which are only vague moments. I don’t recall and fun family moments at all we never did anything together. And honestly i think I’ve probably dissociated my whole life because of how little i can recall and how i feel now. Everything i do is just going through the motions. I can hardly recognize myself as a person. And as an 18 year old about to go into college i have no passion or motivation to have some sort of dream. I don’t see myself having a future and not even in a suicidal way i just can’t process the fact that I’m alive to live a life. I feel so lost
63,Me 100% of time. Name?,https://youtu.be/SDDUa75vcxM
64,Weird memories?,"I have these weird childhood memories that occasionally will replay in my mind and I don't understand them. They're just snap-shot moments that never show anything traumatic but still make my stomach churn for unknown reasons. For example, when I was in 1st or 2nd grade I woke up one night in my bed completely naked. I then saw my pajamas folded on the nightstand and I felt horrified because I knew that I hadn't folded them--I remember thinking, ""I can't fold clothes like that."" The last thing I remembered was falling asleep (in those pajamas). I felt really uncomfortable, but I was too scared to talk to my parents about it. That's all I remember but it pops up all the time and makes me so uncomfortable. That's just one example. I do have trauma that I remember from the same age so it makes me feel like I'd remember if something else had happened. But.. at the same time, there's this dread and weight in me every time the memory comes up. Idk.  I'm just looking for any help or advice, I feel pretty lost. Thanks."
65,Feeling angry all the time,"I don't know if this is the right place for this, but I thought I'd talk about it anyway.

For a large portion of my life I've had pretty bad anger issues, with a tendency to go 0-100 for very little reason at all, even since the age of 8, when I was first put on a child anger management program (was done in my primary school during breaks). This for a while I was able to control, with only having very minor and uncommon outbursts with the only notable one between 8-14 was jolting my mum's steering wheel while on the way home from school, luckily her managing to pull it back before hitting anyone - I'm not quite sure what triggered this to begin with. From 14, my overall mood and temper started to get further and further out of control, with the first times I started shouting and screaming in anger, and when my first feelings of depression began to set in. 

The first outbursts in this time were minor at first, but slowly got worse and worse up until I was 15, where I first started damaging things and myself. At first, I used to slam my desk while doing homework if I got stuck on a question, even if i was calm or happy before it, and then slowly moved on to full on punching my freezer, which has caused a few broken knuckles and fracturing my wrist a few times. During this time, I somehow got into a relationship, which very quickly turned emotionally abusive. The girl would generally treat me like shit, ignore me for days and then convince me it was my fault, cheat on me and then say it was because of something I did, etc. For some reason, I believed this for 9 months until I finally just blocked her out without a word. After this, my anger became worse and worse and more frequent, with now more depressive thoughts and anxiety. I had a few close friends during this time that supported me through the rough relationship, who tried to pull me out of it but I ignored. After all this happened, half the friends that were there for me  I either blocked out or they stopped talking to me. 

After all of that, I began to just feel empty, not angry or depressed, just like I didn't really exist. I don't think I talked to anyone outside of my pre-established  friend group or counselling services for nearly 5 months. All the counselors I did try either vanished and stopped turning up to sessions or just were generally pretty useless. My anger had gone, but i had also mostly stopped showing emotions to people. I made a few more shitty friends after that, and had a girlfriend again which wasn't really eventful, just moved on from each other. After a few more events and the move from high school to college I didn't have any friends left, at all. 
I struggled to make any new friends in college because of the anxiety that remained from my first girlfriend, and a fear I'll end up being abused and mistreated like I was before, however I managed to make a few which I never ended up being close with. 

Finally, at 17, I ended up getting another girlfriend, this time, I was happy. We both spent a lot of time together, nearly 8 hours a day, and were both always there for each other. It went on for 3 months like this,  with us both being really close throughout. It was the first time id ever felt happy and the first time id actually felt like I mattered, I ended up making loads of friends, losing weight, getting in shape etc. Then, one day, for a reason I still have no idea about, she just broke up with me, out of the blue. We still spoke for a while, but it wasn't the same, and it was the most depressed I'd been ever. After a while, my anger started to come back again, and this time at myself and everyone around me. For the past 2 months I've felt scared that I was going to hurt myself, my family or someone around me, and having the only output of my anger being punching a freezer so much that the door completely warped and didn't seal anymore. Whenever someone annoys me, all I can think about is hurting them, which having to genuinely hold myself back so not to assault them. 

I have no idea where to turn or what to do anymore, I've been like this for 4 months strong now. 
I left out some details to stop this being longer than it already is.
Sorry if this is the wrong place."
66,Where are my Bi polar peeps at?,"Alright so I’m semi recently diagnosed, Type 2. Recently my anger has progressed to physical. I have only been physical with someone once, but the past 6 months it’s taking everything in my power to contain my physical anger. I mean I can ask someone a question and if they don’t answer me (ignore me) I want to give em the ol’ razzle dazzle. If my boyfriend does something small like doesn’t take out the trash and just keeps stacking it I get furious. Does anyone have any tips? I’m on Bupropion right now but I think I need to change it up. It helps with my focus but not my racing thoughts, the shadow’s I see, or the anger."
67,"People who tried to kill themselves, what do I do?","I need some help. I picked up the phone yesterday to my drunken moms voice saying she did something bad. I calmed her  down and called an ambulance to pick her up. I met her unconscious body at the hospital but was told I was not allowed to stay due to Covid19.
My main problem is not what happened, but what I can do next. What is the best thing to say to her. So she will not feel guilty(her word)

68,Wanting to experience a reality break,"So I've been having panic attacks since I turned 16 and I'm almost 17 now, never have I experienced a true break from reality until a month ago when i walked to the bank and everything started to feel bigger or tiny, either so far away or just non existent at all. I felt as if i wasn't truly real and that if I could walk in front of a car I'd wake up again. I've never been to a therapist but I've been thinking about it lately. I feel myself questioning reality everyday and wanting to experience that feeling of detachment so i can either kill myself or just not feel real anymore. I'm often alone and in my head, i don't have trouble talking to people but i find myself feeling different from other people now, i don't trust another soul. I truly don't know what's wrong with me but I'm worried that I'm moving towards insanity or the truth, my ideas are making less sense and beating myself (I've been abused as a child so it isn't surprising) makes me feel real again. I find myself watching etika and seeing myself in him almost living through his suicide. I just need help on idk either finally breaking free from reality or keeping myself ok until i can get therapy"
69,"started cymbalta almost 2 months ago, please help","for context, i am a 19 yr old female. i started cymbalta (after taking prozac for years) almost 2 months ago. i was actually supposed to commit suicide when i was on prozac (i was living in my college dorm at the time) but then i had to move back home w my parents bc of corona, so here i am. i really don’t want my parents to be the ones to find my body so that’s why i’m alive. having to move back home truly saved my life. but a couple weeks after moving home i started cymbalta and now i’m back to trying to kill myself. so it’s not that i’m no longer suicidal, bc i am, but i was gonna wait till i move back out but ive tried hanging myself again and the belt doesn’t work with my closet door at home so hanging isn’t an option anymore. i would OD but i tried that when i was 14 and i was very close to succeeding but i obviously didnt and the aftermath was hell. i had to be carried to the bathroom when i was in the hospital (like physical hospital) because i was so weak. so i don’t wanna try that again. i don’t know if it’s my severe depression or the cymbalta but i suddenly am having a hard time waiting till i move back out in a few months to kill myself. please help- do you think it’s just my chronic depression or has the cymbalta f*cked with me?"

72,My week,"Hi everyone,

I don't really know the reason that is leading me to post this but I just need to get it out somehow.

My name is Jim, I'm 32 and a week ago I was ready to kill myself. I had been drinking every day for a week and almost every day for years. But I went especially hard for the weekend. I woke up on Monday, remembered who I was, drank from the half bottle of rum on my kitchen bench and ran a bath. I sat in that bath and called a few people - my brother, my sister and my oldest friend. I wanted to talk to them one last time but they figured out what I was doing. 

I moved from my home country to where I am now in February. It was supposed to be my fresh start but only I knew the real plan. I was going to stay for a month or two then leave. I was going to run somewhere nobody could find me. I was going to die somewhere I couldn't be found. This virus fucked all that up for me. 

Back to Monday. The people I talked to called eachother and then contacted the local police to do a welfare check. They found me drunk in my bath and took me to hospital. From there I was placed in a secure mental health unit. I was interviewed many times and honestly they did a fantastic job but I convinced them it was all a misunderstanding and they let me leave Wednesday. 

Since then I haven't felt anything. I haven't talked to anyone. I don't even want to drink anymore and am 7 days sober. I can't talk to my family anymore because I can't get past the shame. I feel no hope. I'm dead already. 

I can't remember a time in my life when I was actually happy. I have maintained a decent facade for everyone until the last few years but I've always felt the darkness right inside me just below the surface. There are too many things I need to forget. 

I was sexually abused as a child. This is the first time I have every said that or typed that anywhere. I can't face it.  I can only now see how much it affected every aspect of my life. I feel worthless. I have no self esteem. I have ruined relationships with amazing people in the past through my own inablitily to be honest with myself. 

I know people would tell me to get help, to talk to someone. I don't want help. I think there's something seriously wrong with me and it scares me too much. I can't talk about my life, I've tried. It has been enjoyable at times of course, but I can never really be at peace. I know there is no way I can. I don't want medication and I can't talk.

Something I have heard people say that resonates with me is the feeling of wanting to go home but not being able to find it.  I'm just so tired. I'm all alone now but I kind of like it. No one has to think about me now. I don't know what happens next but I know I don't have much strength left. 

""I need a crowd of people, but I can't face them day to day
My problems are meaningless, but that don't make them go away"" 
(or something like that) 
-Neil Young 

Anyway I am just going to post this somewhere. I'm not looking for anything in particular I just wanted to tell my story. 
Thanks for reading if you did, and have a nice day."
73,Please help!,"Hi anyone that reads this.

I (34m) have been married to my wife (30f) for 4 years, we have been together 12 years and have 3 children.

At the start of lockdown we were on a group chat with her friends and while she left the room i was behind the camera so no one knew i was there. ( i was sat at the opposite side of the table, not eavesdropping). 
I overheard her friends discussing that she had a threesome with our 2 closest friends while i was asleep on the sofa a couple of weeks before lockdown.

I have confronted her about it and she is obviously denying it all saying it was 3 other people and not her. 

I have a long history of paranoia depression and hallucinations, which i have weekly conversations with my GP about. 

This feels different! Im certain i heard it correctly but given my history i cannot trust my own ears or thoughts (if that makes sense??)

Naturally the 1st thing anyone in their right mind would say is you have to leave. Although this poses a serious threat to my mental wellbeing.

I have no social life . .  At all! I lost contact with all my old friends when my family moved away a year before meeting my wife.
I have no one to talk to about any of this as the only people i could talk to are supposedly involved. 

Now i am finding the voices are getting louder and more agressive (in my head). I am desperately trying to stay strong for my kids and wife but this is proving difficult.

I can't lose everything again! I have been having very strong urges to end my life.

The point is, i genuinely can't tell if i have had sone sort of elaborate delusion ( as i have many times before) or if this has actually happened. 
I want to see my kids grow up and tuck them in at night, i really dont want to die. I just dont see an alternative.

Please help! Anyone. . ."
74,Do I really need to forgive my emotionally abusive father?,"I don't feel at home at home. For reference I'm a transgender (Male to female) 16 year old. My dad always drank, treated me like a piece of shit, and emotionally abused me. Luckily my mom didn't let him physically abuse me because that was ""Too far"" and she'd leave him (As she's the primary provider that would have been bad for him). 

Well my mom stopped him from hitting me physically she did very little for what he did emotionally. She always pretended like nothing happened. 

However a few months ago I was gonna kill myself but my friend called the cops and I was hospitalized for 3 days. My dad had agreed to stop drinking and treat me better. Everyone on the room (My mom, dad, and brother) where giving me a look saying I needed to say something and I knew what they wanted to hear. ""I'll give our relationship another shot"" I said. I knew I was lying. 

I'm a forgiving ass person btw. Like I forgive EVERYONE seriously! He's dead as a the only time I've ever decided fuck it. I'm not forgiving you. You're not worth my time. So eventually after time passed and I wasn't giving him leeway my mom confronted me. She yelled and screamed at me for not forgiving calling me a problem. Quite frankly she brought back my suicidal thoughts. I had already been in a downward spiral but she really triggered me. When I'm called a problem I feel like I'd be better off gone because then the problems gone right?

Also I feel it's important to note he *has* been drinking again recently. Just nothing hard so it's fine in both of their eyes. And his treatment if me is getting worse. Again. 

Am I really the problem? Am I doing something wrong by not forgiving him? Please... Help me..."
75,Do you know where the hate comes from?,It disturbs both the entities.
76,"An ""in real time"" experience of situational depression","“What is situational depression like?” you may wonder to yourself if you’ve ever heard of it. The good part and hard part is I am writing this during a “depressive episode” as I call it. I am writing as I feel myself starting to spiral deeper into it and I have the power and willpower to pull myself out of it because I’ve worked incredibly hard to create that strength inside of myself, and situational depression is VERY different from clinical depression or major depression or other kinds of depression. They are relatively brief EPISODES or EXPERIENCES of moderate to severe depression. I do not know the clinical definition but will include it at the end. This is MY personal, lived experience ONLY of it. 

I am currently living with my parents during the pandemic, the pandemic being relevant to everyone’s mental health not to mention my own mother’s depression and anxiety issues. I have been living with them for three years as I worked part-time and did pre-requisites for my graduate program which I got into in March, one week before the pandemic hit… It is supposed to start the last week of September. I am currently unemployed and not getting unemployment because my first, second and third applications have never been approved despite entering accurate information and addresses, etc. I was supposed to be substitute teaching all this spring semester and all of August onward. Now I do not know if I will have a job. I only have $2000 saved for moving. I was meant to have $5000 saved to pay for the entire semester and have a big buffer in case of issues with subbing &amp; being a full-time graduate student, as well as winter break which is 4ish weeks in length… 

Situational depression is very selfish, and hard. It is a spiral because you know it is selfish which only fuels the shame that started the depressive episode and therefore you spiral deeper and deeper into self-loathing and self-hate. 

I got into a fight with my parents because they said I made a blanket statement when I did not. At first I was very angry with them because they often accuse me of things or put words in my mouth that are not true or what I meant. This has happened my entire life and cuts straight to the small child inside of me feeling unloved always. She never feels good enough. When she comes out and starts devouring my attention, soul, and heart, it is like a knife cutting through my chest. I start to have tears well up in my eyes. Sometimes I start to think about suicide even though I know it would hurt my family deeply if I killed myself and I know even more so that I don’t truly want to die, nor do I want to hurt them further than I already do by existing as a complete and total failure. 

As I decided to write some letters this late evening I started to think about how I had not written letters in awhile and how it sounded almost like a good-bye. I then started thinking, “is that what I am doing? Am I subconsciously saying good-bye to my family and loved ones?” It wasn’t but I briefly wondered about it and wasn’t so sure if it would be such a bad thing if I were dead. 

I feel like a failure. I’ll be 27 in a couple months and just ended a three year long relationship in which we had seriously talked about living together. I am starting a graduate program and I feel like a complete fraud. I feel like an imposter, imposter syndrome? I do not feel I deserve to be in the program. All I feel like is a fat, lazy, stupid, loud-mouthed, foolish, immature, poorly spoken, ignorant, can NEVER SHUT UP idiot. I feel like this very often. I have tried self-help books and therapy. I have tried happiness classes, exercising, and meditation and ASMR, and a lot. I know it helps a little bit and I know CONSISTENCY is key to making a difference. That is the problem with situational depression. I am a FAILED PERFECTIONIST. I hate being such an utter pathetic and stupid failure but I cannot be consistent in change, or tidiness, or organization or ANYTHING. It is a really sad and stupid life to live but I cannot let go of my perfectionism completely and I cannot seem to actually make any consistent changes to my personality, brain, body, etc.

It’s especially selfish to feel this way during a pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests happening across the world. I am not Black. I am not “poor” because of my parents even if I myself am “low-income.” I am not experiencing racism in general let alone institutionalized and systemic racism. I hate that I know this and I know it’s selfish and stupid. I know that I am so blessed and privileged and lucky. I know that I should have gratitude and just GET ON WITH LIFE AND HELP OTHER PEOPLE. It’s just really hard to do that when you spiral. It’s funny because sometimes I \*almost\* feel like the description of another mood disorder like bipolar disorder but just in more SLOW motion. Like I can go from days or weeks or months of solid contentment and effort and then just one BIG mistake or fight or something bigger like that can STILL make me spiral. The spirals are briefer and less deeper than before therapy and the years of effort I gave and still give to working with my situational depression. Back then it could last days or weeks or longer and was a lot more self-destructive. It was heavy self-hatred when I was a teen/early twenties, often buried underneath the surface of normalcy and day-to-day life. 

I could ramble for days but I am pulling myself out of the spiral and back to feeling more normal. Maybe this helped, I don’t know. 

Definition: Situational depression is a short-term, stress-related type of depression. It can develop after you experience a traumatic event or series of events. Situational depression is a type of adjustment disorder. It can make it hard for you to adjust to your everyday life following a traumatic event. It’s also known as reactive depression.

Events that can cause situational depression include:

* problems at work or school
* illness
* death of a loved one
* moving
* relationship problems
* Other traumatic events

**Impostor syndrome** (also known as **impostor** phenomenon, impostorism, fraud **syndrome** or the **impostor** experience) is a psychological pattern in which one doubts one's accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a ""fraud""."
77,Can’t move on from my high school tormentor,"It’s been 2 years since I graduated high school. I had this “friend” who would bully me every single day. I don’t want to go into detail but this person was the devil. I tolerated this for 4 whole years. When I graduated, I cried and cried on the way home because I knew I would never have to see this person ever again. They still tried to reach out to me right after graduation but I never replied to them. Thankfully they got the point and stopped talking to me, yet the scar has never healed and to this day I am constantly checking this person’s social media. I’m afraid it’s become an obsession and I don’t know why. It’s quite embarrassing, really. I’m consumed by this person’s life. I want to move on, but it’s hard."
78,I’m tired,of everything
79,Question for Professionals!,"Okay so, I’m in a relationship and he’s different from my other relationships i’ve had. He seems almost emotionless, but is able to show that he cares and loves me. But when it comes to his own feelings, he results to cutting off everyone and thinking to himself. So a couple of days ago he got back from a camping trip for his birthday. And a bit before that and during it we were arguing quite a bit. But when he got back he asked if we could take a pause or break on our relationship. I convinced him not and we went to bed kinda normal but on a weird term, he just said “I just need to think, I’ll text you tomorrow”. And then he didn’t text me for 2 days and left me on open and delivered. The same with my friend that was also concerned. I had a complete mental BREAKDOWN. But besides that, I told him a bunch of stuff like “I want you to talk to me about what’s going on” and all that, letting him know that I care and want to help. But nothing. But about 12 hours later i texted him that i couldn’t do this anymore and i need him to help me to understand what is happening because i truly had no idea what was going on. Then he texted me explaining everything. But i’ll try and explain this as short as possible...
Basically he felt that our relationship was going to shit. He has a lot of female friends and this one girl, Anna, is a person he goes to talk to about his problems a lot because she “understands his head” is what he said. I told him i don’t like her because before we started dating, we all hung out and she was always on him and hugging him and touching him. So i knew she liked him in some way. So he said since he wanted to talk to her, he got it mixed up in his head and thought that he had feelings for her. (to let you know we are are teens so I understand the whole teenager feels). He said he thought about it and asked for a break because he wanted to figure out what he wanted to do because he didn’t know if he liked her, but still really liked me. But then he said he just didn’t answer any texts and didn’t really realize he was ignore and cutting everyone off. He says that’s the only way he knows how to deal with his problems. I get that and he has a family that’s always up his ass with everything, but I want him to open up to me. I want to be the person that “understands his head” the best. Because he has his best friend Aiden and then that girl Anna. Those two people help him. I want to be one of those people. I don’t know how to help. But I was wondering what could I do to help him the best way? How do I become his number one person to go to? I also want to understand why he isolates himself? Please help!"

82,Opinions on if i have asperger syndrome,"I was reading up on some of the symptoms and i do have some of the ones google listed such as depression, anxiety, social isolation, socially awkward, an all absorbing or intense interest in a limited number of subjects, i often have a very hard or impossible time understanding things other people find simple, and pretty much the only dreams i have are nightmares. Does this fit asperger syndrome or is it all just separate things that are a big coincidence?"
83,I don't want to go to therapy anymore,"Throwaway because I don't feel comfortable with my main.

I have been struggling with mental health for the past two to three years. Probably even before, but I used to just shrug and tell myself that ""it was nothing"" (I am notorious for a certain lack of self awareness when it comes to feelings). Basically, I have zero self esteem, difficulty in coping with my feelings, along with a sensation of utter discomfort when I consider that, to me, life has no meaning, everything is dull and I have no purpose and no will to do anything, usually for weeks on end, even if with some bright spots.

Recently, my life is getting progressively worse (I am at uni, already late at graduating and I am unable to study. Every time I try to, I get anxious and procrastinate and end up hating myself even more. I made up my mind to go and see a therapist, to sort things out and start feeling less miserable.

But as soon as I decided to go for it, something switched in my mind and now it seems like whatever I have is not that bad and that I would go to therapy and basically make a fool of myself for wanting to go. As if ""yes it was bad, but look at you, you are already better. The thing is, it happened in the past, too, and it was only temporary. But it gets me every time. Is it normal? Should I go regardless?"

85,I had 2 anxiety attacks in my 4-hour exam,"I started my exam panicking and experienced what people often told me were anxiety attacks where my heart rate increased rapidly, have lightheadedness and deep and frequent breaths. The first one I calmed down fairly quickly at the start. The second one lasted for half an hour after I came back from a toilet break. I didn't know what to do. Evidence? How do I provide evidence? I'm alone in my room, I didn't want to alert an invigilator because I felt like I didn;t have evidence. The question wasn't too hard, just a bit weird,manageable, and doable, but I over spent time on it, even when I told myself to just skip to the next one, I didn;t. Honestly, I almost just left with my paper half finish. 

Honestly I don't even know.  I practically flunked two test already. and the safety net policy isn't much of anything. 

HOnestly, when I think about it. I do have anxiety attacks once or twice per exam season. but I never alerted the invigilator because I'd always think that it was my fault, that this is because of lack of preparation, but the panic really caused me to not be able to focus on anything. It;s a snowball effect. I couldn't calm down at all."

89,First appointment with a psychiatrist,"So I finally took the first step towards improving my mental health. First I spoke with a social worker, who then helped me schedule my first appointment with a psychiatrist after a lengthy phone assessment. She was so kind and patient, I felt bad that she had to try to make out what I was trying to say through my heavy sobs. But I couldn’t help it, I literally cried like I’ve never cried before, during the entire assessment. But I’m nervous. I’m scared the psychiatrist will turn out to be someone who doesn’t listen, or is condescending or something along that line. I’ve read stories about people who went with different psychiatrists, because some of them don’t seem to listen, and because of that they will possibly misdiagnose them?

91,"Help please... Binge-eating, utter lack of motivation, oversleeping and irritability","I'm new to Reddit as a poster so I feel I should give some backstory here.

Backstory:

I am female, 21. I work full time as a content writer for technology in an IT company (SEO milking type). I am also a full-time design student in my second year.  

Initially, I wanted to focus on my studies and university was very important to me - in a field I am genuinely passionate about. However, last year of high school my mom (only parent) had cancer, so I had to postpone uni by a year. I got a job and supported myself and my family as much as I can. I still do.

 I started uni in 2018. For two years, I have juggled 15 subjects workload per semester with a lot of practical projects and deadlines. And I have also been working full time. So my average day would be.. going out at 7 for lectures and working till 10 at night. (In quarantine it is different of course, but the workload is the same).

I also had a pretty manipulative narcissistic ex (7 yrs), that was obsessive and controlling: from food, working out, social life, habits, uni, work etc. The relationship really chipped away at my sanity, sense of self-worth and generally became the lowest point of my life, mentally last two years.  I broke up with him before the quarantine. 

Now: 

In the next few weeks, I have an insane workload to cover if I want to pass my exams. And additionally, at work, they are constantly raising expectations for what I am supposed to turn in - I am also paid the bare minimum, while the workload is for two. The switch between two different fields (marketing writing and design), both intellectual tasking is exhausting. The last few weeks, I have been having trouble falling asleep or waking up. I also notice old habits of emotional binge-eating from when my ex tried to control my food (that led to weight gain and even lower self-esteem). I feel distracted, I can't focus neither on work, uni, hobbies, training... nothing. I feel shitty a lot of the time, I get constant headaches (residue from past concussion, yey...) and I feel guilty because I am so fucking far behind on all of my work. Feels like I am drowning. I'm also fairly irritable to  family because of it - even tho they are insanely supportive.

So.. does anyone have any tips on how I can go through the rough patch? I have plans to take a step back from work (half-time + freelance when I can) starting in October, with the support of my sister. Or at least taking a design job so I can be focused on one field. But it is not an option by then (my family relies on me heavily for necessities), I need to keep my current job - which I hate more and more by the day. I can't afford to take a step back on uni either..I have to take all my exams, or I won't be able to take some very important classes next year.

Do you have any tips on how I can take care of my health while grinding away at my responsibilities? Aside from, water, eating healthier and exercise - I already try to do all that, along with prioritized sleep.

Anyway, thank you for reading and I will make sure to read any and all responses!"
92,(triggering) is is this emotional abuse,"I am 15 years old and I need help identifying whether I am being emotionally abused at home by my mom. Background: I was hit and screamed at a lot when I was younger and my parents cuss very frequently, especially my mom (my dad in fact calls her a psycho and crazy b*tch because of it)
Today's incident: (extremely triggering I am sorry. If you are afraid of having emotional flashbacks over this please don't read ahead)

My mom wanted me to help with her computer software but I didn't feel like it. So she got really mad and started screaming and saying things that provoked me (such as that I will never be happy and that my personality will drive people away in school) so I told her I was leaving the house temporarily. When I tried to leave she grabbed me, hit me and then dragged me to scream at me. I kept trying to leave during this but she slammed the door so that I couldn't do so, kept pulling me by the arm and throwing things at me when I tried to get away, and hit me again. She said things which may be considered gaslighting (that I hurt her and mock her even though I really don't, that I want her dead and won't feel a thing when she dies.) kept yelling at me what went wrong with her parenting of me. Keep in mind I said nothing throughout this entire interaction and was trying to keep as stoic as possible. She also said that if I find her parenting extreme or wrong I should just become more resourceful and less sensitive. She was cussing and using bad language throughout this ENTIRE interaction. When I broke down in front of her she started screaming at me louder.

This seems to be emotional abuse but my mom isn't always like this. When she's calm she compliments me and shows me affection. I'm really conflicted. Please give your opinion."

96,I want my self and my life back,"I'm gonna totally skip depression and anxiety in this post and talk about the real damage I'm taking right now.

I feel like everything I do is just a nail my coffin. I can't afford therapy or consulting and I only have two friends in my town and talking to them about my problems is not helping at all I finally came to realize and accept that I'm alone in this. My focus has dropped, my reading skills decreased, I went from writing whole pages in minutes to not be able to write a single paragraph and even my English became so poor because I haven't read any English book in 2 years. I live with my family in a beautiful small town but I'm isolated from the local society and I'm almost like a shadow here lurking around with only some people on the way to lighten up my darkness. In August I'll be 24 realizing that another year have passed not having done nearly anything I wanted. Because I'm a loser, I ditch my responsibilities, cut off from the social world, not able to sit nicely and complete my tasks, unable to be decent and actually finish something. I don't like to say this but I feel like I'm a scum of the earth, a parasite, a dirty old man spitted me to life from his dirty mouth, a human waste. Yes, indeed I am. but I'm not saying it's all my fault and I'm not saying it's the other way around either. I prefer that I forget about the distant causes because it's a vicious cycle to think about them. Hell exist guys and to those who doesn't believe in it, well YOU SHOULD it's right there staring at you, it's the chaos lurking in the corners, it's being in the wrong place in the wrong time, it's the one you mistake you might do that will destroy your whole life. Hell is not other people, hell is where other people might be living. Hell is to have a 40 inches plasma screen, a new phone, and a robust laptop but no life to enjoy them. To possess everything yet to have nothing. To have some good things in life yet a soul that doesn't know how to cherish them. It's when you used to be loving and caring and you get emotional everytime you see injustice or some fellow human being suffering but now you can't feel a thing because the domain in which you used to find compassion and sympathy became the domain in which you see how life have crushed you and threw you in a dirty alley like some old rug. Hell is not other people, Sartre said that because he believed that people will look at you and judge you forcing you into being. But you will judge yourself ferociously and relentlessly and you will be even incapable of looking at yourself in the mirror. Your own eyes are the ultimate hell. And your face is the ultimate sufferer. Next time I will do this post right, I will rewrite it in a perfectly sophisticated manner."
97,I didn't end it on Saturday and now nothing feels real,"I was going to. It's probably the closest I've been since I actually tried when I was 15. Had a plan and a note and was saying goodbye. But it didn't happen. I feel so strange like nothing is quite real, like this is some kind of Twilight Zone, like I'm a ghost. 

I don't know what to do now. I'm just still here. Today wasn't supposed to happen, and everything is still too much, I'm still completely trapped, but it all feels so far away. 

I guess therapy. I guess that's what you do, right? I don't want to go on medication. I've had really bad experiences with that in the past. The psych ward would make me worse. The crowding, the isolation. Those aren't places you go to get better, and they're really bad on trans people generally. I think it would make things worse.

Why do I feel so weird?"
98,[Academic Research] Eating disorder participants wanted! (optional entry into £100 prize raffle upon completion),"Hello, I am a master's student at the University of Hull, UK.

I am hoping to recruit participants to take part in my online study. The study is trying to find out how different temporary mindsets (called 'schema modes') link with wellbeing. Previous studies have found that people with eating disorders may experience more unhelpful mindsets than usual. Also, that 'Schema Therapy', which deals with these mindsets, could be useful for helping this group of people. The results of this study will be important to support the assessment of the schema modes of people with eating disorders, which could then help Schema Therapy to treat eating disorders.

To be eligible to take part, you must be 18+ and have had an eating disorder diagnosis.

Please follow the link to the survey for the full details. [https://hull.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/edschemamodesandwellbeing](https://hull.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/edschemamodesandwellbeing)

100,Any autistic adults here?,"I’m a 28yo male who was diagnosed with autism when I was 6, and at this point in my life I’m really struggling to comprehend society or how I’m expected to feel like I fit in when all I’ve ever faced is adversity and contempt towards the way I am and the way I think.

I just don’t know what I’m here for, I mean, it’s not like I haven’t tried to fit in,l or find myself in this world, I worked in the security industry for just short of a decade I broke so many boundaries around my comfort zones to do so, but due to the laziness and corruption of the people I worked for (in every company, just the industry as a whole) i can’t bring myself to strive towards doing my job without hating myself for not doing something to it’s best potential like they trained me to, because any time i have ever tried to do that I just get fired eventually. 

I have a big interest in gaming but frankly the reason I don’t stream is because of the way autism is viewed by society, I’m definitely one of the more socially capable people with autism, most people can’t even tell because I’ve put so much work into my presentation and mannerisms. I just can’t see that as a career or option for those reasons. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore tbh, I don’t know what my career should be, or even who I am in this world. because everything I stand for, truth, honesty, integrity, this world just doesn’t seem to care about it anymore, it’s all about capitalism and being rich, core human values are fading but I’m not the type of person who can change with the times like that, my mind and heart won’t let me, my belief and focus in what’s right and logical is too strong to be corrupted or waver, 

I tried to kill myself numerous times from the age of 23 up until last year, the mental pressure and resulting depression I felt was enormous because my time in education when I was younger was very short, I was always seen as a problem child and constantly expelled when all I wanted to do was learn and sponge information they couldn’t give me because I had to wait until my next semester when it was appropriate and scheduled to be taught, this constantly annoyed me, i was there to learn but they wouldn’t teach me instead removing me so I wasn’t a problem, sticking me in isolation in an underground learning unit like a criminal, so without qualifications I have no career prospects in any industry except the one I’m trained in, all I have is who I am and what I’ve achieved, however irrelevant that may be, and in this day and age that isn’t good enough to succeed anymore. so what am I supposed to do? I just honestly don’t know.

I don’t know if there are any fellow adults here with autism but I could honestly do with the opinion and guidance of one because I feel like I’m alone on this and nobody I meet or know can give me answers or help me find clarity because they don’t understand. 

I want to do better in life and feel better about myself, I just don’t know how. 

I don’t really share my thought process much for obvious reasons, but I need to get past this brick wall holding me back or i will never succeed at anything.

thank you for reading,"
101,I’m Scared of losing control and then killing myself involuntarily,"**Hi girls and boys.** 

This may not be the correct sub but I need some advice. 

So, I find myself thinking almost constantly ( some days ) about losing my mind and not being able to control my body and in the end, jumping off from my balcony? (I live on the 16th floor) 

I’m not even suicidal. I don’t want to kill myself but I’m constantly scared of losing control and then unconsciously killing myself. 

I don’t know if it’s a common thing or if I need to get therapy. Although I feel better when I’m around people because my head likes to believe that if I lose control, they might stop me from killing myself!? 

There are smaller things that scare me Like, thinking I might be capable of unconsciously throwing my phone out of the car. 

More context: whenever I take a shower or whenever I’m in a locked room, I imagine the worst possible things. 

For example: I hear my mom crying and yelling. (hallucinations!?) 

Should I get professional help? Or is it a normal thing that’ll pass in a while?"
102,I don’t know how to get out of this (34 M Australia),"I don’t know where to start with this but here goes. Since late last year the world’s just been shit and now I’m having to be the peacekeeper at home as tensions are now growing amongst family.

I live with my family to help out since mum’s cancers and all the treatments she went through. My brother is meant to be her carer and is payed good money to do so but would rather just smoke weed all day and ignore everyone else including his own kid. He’s actually so much of an asshole we’re all happy when he goes to his mate’s/dealer’s place to smoke and blow most of his government payment on weed to bring back home and smoke all day everyday. Every time I try to bring up the fact he’s an addict I just get shot down and just have to deal with him being an asshole. And when he’s out I’m the one who mum vents to about him, then when I go to she just gets upset at me and makes me feel like the prick. I’m constantly walking on eggshells around everyone because one wrong word and it’ll explode.

I’ve dealt with depression on and off since I was a teenager and I feel trapped between forcing myself to keep it together and the family ripping itself apart.

Then there’s been the constant shitty state of the world for the past 6 months, between the bushfires, covid and now the protests. I’ve lost count at how many times if almost cried watching the news. I’ve had family and friends in a few countries affected by them. I feel so small and isolated and just scared for people I know, but feel guilty for living in somewhere that had almost no direct impact from them.

I had a friend die in a car accident last week and I literally can’t even bring myself to start processing those feelings. But the other day I got to listen to two family members read out loud the rant that someone who knew him wrote on publicly Facebook saying they were glad he died. For over an hour, knowing I was in the next room and could hear them, calling out to me asking questions about him. So can’t wait to open up that box of feelings at some point.

I realise every just writing this I’m getting angry, but there’s more.

So I’ve barely been sleeping lately and some days I can’t even bring myself to eat because I’m  just so frayed and on edge. I wake up most mornings now to the sound of mum watching what I now call “Garbage people TV” on YouTube (Judge Judy, paternity court, the Maury Show, Jerry Springer, etc), so people just screaming loudly at each other for entertainment. Usually on two different TVs with the volume up so there’s nowhere I can’t hear it. I think because it’s families worst than us she feels better watching it. And this goes on all day.

Then today she drops the bombshell she’s started taking antidepressants. She tells me after telling me about how much of a cunt my brother was to her this morning, and as soon as I say something to agree with her, BOOM, she blurts it out. I ask her what else I can do to help her as I’m starting to cry and she just walks away leaving me standing there to try and deal with that.

All this family shit has been building up for a couple of years and I’ve learned if I try to say anything it quickly escalates into a fight and I’m just so tired of being made out to be the bad guy. I’m tired of being the one she calls for everything because her “not an addict” drug-fucked son either can’t or won’t help her. I’m just tired of it all.

Being from a small city there’s almost no mental health support here. There’s either a several month waiting list or I can go to a private doctor for hundreds of dollars a visit. I know this because a few years back when I had a breakdown I had to wait it out. 

But this time it’s different, I can’t escape it. Sure every so often we act like a normal happy family but that only ever lasts a couple of days at most. One of us will take a comment the wrong way and it’ll snowball right back to shit.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Even just typing this I’ve gone from stressed to angry to sad. I don’t see myself finding my way back to happiness by myself anymore."
103,"Too much time with wife, what can I do?","Since the pandemic, my wife has been home all of the time, no routine, works for the government so is fully paid. I have to work, albeit less,  but keep a routine. I find her being around all the time just draining. I don’t want to hurt her feelings but I feel so sad having so much time with her around me. When things were normal we both had our work and routines and we met spent less time, but more quality time together. There’s little to talk about as we’re not doing anything so we have no experiences to share.

I feel desperate to have some space on my own, but have never felt the need to as life normally has us doing our own thing as well as sharing time together.

I also follow her OCD hygiene procedures and it’s slowly eating away at me as I find it exhausting and only do it for her.

If I go shopping I have to have all my clothes washed!

104,I feel as if there was someone else in my head...,"So first of all, I just want to say that english isn't my first language, so sorry if some things are hard to understand.
 So lately I've started to feel like there's someone else in my head, it's kinda difficult to explain but I'll do my best. 
 I feel like this because some of the choices I take, some of the thoughts I have and some of the things that I do feel like they are done by someone else, again as if there was something in my head making choices for me (and making the worst ones lol). Obviously I know that there isn't some entity in my head, maybe a better way of putting it would be to say that I'm losing control of myself to a certain extent. 
 This makes me feel awful obviously because I never know what bad decision that will mess up my life even more I'll make next, and because I can never really enjoy anything that I'm doing because I'm aware of this all the time.
 Also I've gone through some trauma when I was 14 (basically someone very close to me in my family died unexpectedly) and I never talked about this with anyone. I say that because I imagine that the feelings I have now probably relate to that trauma.
 Anyway, that is basically what I'm feeling, again, I'm sorry if any of this doesn't make sense, like I said english isn't my first language and this is the first time that I really talk about my feelings. So if you think you can help in some way please comment. I know that I probably need help from an actual psychologist, but I want to start by getting some advice from someone anonymous first, because talking about my feelings in person is very difficult for me lol."

106,How can I talk to my parents about my mental health problems,"Hi everyone:)English isn't my first language so sorry for my mistakes.
I know that I have mental health issues and that I need professional help but I don't know how to tell my parents. 3 years ago I wrote a letter to my mom that saying I feel depressed and lonely and about my other problems.She said that she understands me and it's normal for people at my age and it will pass.But 3 years later here I am nothing changed only got worse.After that whenever I feel like telling them my heart beats so fast and I can't breath.I don't have enough courage to talk about it. How did you tell your parents about your mental health issues ?How should I talk them about it?

P.S:In my country you have 2 choice first one is going to gov hospital(u dont have to pay for a visit )(for a psychologist or a psychiatrist) but you only have 15 min(each session is 15 min plus u have no privacy.you and the doctor is not the only ones in the room) to talk with your doctor and many psychiatrist just writes med right away or you could go to a clinic (you have to pay for a visit and it is quite expensive) and you can talk to your doctor 45 minutes for session.There is big one problem.In my country some people who did not study   psychology can open a clinic.(they go to some courses).I think it's kinda scary .I wonder how the system works in your country."
107,I can't take masculinity anymore. It's too much for me,"I can't do this anymore.

No matter what I do, no matter changes I make, I'm never, ever enough. I'm sick of this. I'm sick of masculinity. I'm sick of the limits. I'm sick of the rules and stigmas. I'm sick of the ""Either you're a drag queen, or hyper-masculine, or else you don't exist"". 

I'm trying to pave my own way, doing what I want, but it's never ever ever good enough for everybody. Being unique means nothing. It's like I lack something, and I don't know want, but I'm never on anybody's radar no matter how highly they think of me,

I'm sick of being invisible. I'm sick of being a man. I want to change genders just to pass as something else, just to be noticed for once."

I don't think this is my absolute lowest point in life, but  god damn it is low.

Lately I have been having physical symptoms of anxiety but I’m just chillin.  I have chest pressure and feels like my heart is beating like crazy and my throat is tight.  but my HR is always normal. My bp is also normal.  The only mental symptom is not wanting to get up and do anything and just lay in bed.  But I don’t mentally feel anxious when this happens.

I came across a post the other day about some big crush this girl had and it totally flooded back all these memories and thoughts. I had a huge crush on this guy back in high school. He lived in a different state and we didn’t date bc knew it wouldn’t work long distance (we were 16) but I fell for this guy. Then one day his phone was cut off and we lost touch. I rebounded to a guy I was with for 7 years and have a kid and went into another relationship who I’m with and that part drives me nuts that I’m even thinking about this other guy. I mean that was 10 years ago lol but the connection and feelings I had were so intense. 

Reality is who knows and plan to talk to my therapist about this bc I played out a bunch of stuff in my head. 

My parents were on the verge of divorce and had to move from this state and by the way, that state was my happiest moments of childhood and I wish I didn’t get involved with the 7 year relationship and moved back to that state where I had an amazing best friend too and lost connection over the years with me living in my original state. I feel like I’d have had a totally different life and probably happier because I followed what I wanted. I don’t know who I am or what I want. What’s real and what’s not. 

I don’t know.. I just have an impulse to want to reach out but again... who knows if he really felt the same way or I was just another girl. My life has moved on and started building a new life with my boyfriend and have a kid. So what the heck? Why is my mind doing this to me :/"

About two years ago I starved myself for a year. I never got underweight but it was noticeable and I did look pretty ill but I’ve stopped now. But the body image issues still remain. 

Since my last check up 5 months ago (have to go every sixth months to check blood pressure) I’ve gained 6/7kg. And I’m only 5’1” so it’s noticeable. I’m not obese and I’m not unhealthy. But I’m a dancer so being this weight makes me really uncomfortable. I don’t know why I’ve gained this much. I eat pretty healthily, more so than before I started the pill and I’m also exercising regularly. It’s really affecting me now and I don’t know what to do."
118,"Advice appreciated on staying in touch with family, friends &amp; self while coping with a mental illness.","Hey everyone. 

Long story short I struggle with social anxiety related to C-PTSD.  I understand how this manifests in terms of “how do I make daily interactions with strangers” however it has been quite difficult for me to stay in touch with quite literally, anyone. 

Before you say “just reach out, get help, be honest” it would be helpful to explain my train of thought with this. I have NEVER been good with communicating. After being raised in a very poor example of what healthy communication looks like, it’s almost as if I cannot gauge what healthy communication looks like. Motivation is there to want to do something about this. The circle jerk of intrusive thoughts it leads me to, however, is absolutely exhausting. I don’t know where to start. 

Basically what I’d like to understand more:

• About how often do you talk to close friends and family? How much is too much/not enough? I worry often that I will be an annoyance to someone’s daily routine, especially with newer friends. Another burden for someone ELSE to respond to in their daily lives. I realize this makes the relationship distant. 

• What communication advice do you have on solidifying a relationship (of any type) through the good and the bad of mental struggles? The story goes: tell people I’ll try harder to communicate, genuinely mean it, fall back into this viscous cycle and continue to disappoint. I always try to explain without excuses but shit, of course you won’t understand the things that go through my head- it doesn’t function like it’s supposed to. This leaves me feeling a mix of more frustrated/misunderstood/helpless.

I’m at a loss with where to start, advice is appreciated."
119,I tend to subconsciously link everyday words/incidents to traumatic experiences and it’s terrifying me,"I hate that I do this so often and I don’t know if it’s just me or if this actually is something but I just want it to stop. 

I have quite a few traumatic memories about something from my past and I tend to somehow find a link to those memories quite regularly. For instance, if I hear the word X (completely random word, could be anything like a table or phone or car), I end finding links from word X to some other word Y to Z until I get to something that directly reminds me of my trauma. 

I’d get if they were direct reminders to my past. But they aren’t, it’s my brain making things worse. This is really upsetting and scaring me and I don’t even know what to call it or how to stop this or if anyone else feels the same."
120,What to do when you have traumatic dreams?*trigger warning*,I've been having really bad dreams lately where I'm raped or sexually assaulted. I've never been raped or anything in real life so I don't know why I've been having them? Sometimes they make me gave panic attacks when I remember them but I don't want to complain because it was just a dream and not a actual event. I'm adopted and I kinda grew up in a toxic house. I've never been abused or anything but my mom once said she wish she never adopted me so that's cool I guess. I know she didn't mean it but I was like 8 and it really hurt me. I have problems with intrusive thoughts and paranoid thoughts ever since I was a kid. I've been in therapy since I was 4 even though I never told anyone about the thoughts. My mom just sorta made me do it because I have ADHD. I think about suicide at least 30 times a day and I just don't really know what to do? All I want to do is die all the time. I feel bad because people have way worse problems and been through way worse yet I'm the one that wants to kill myself. I just don't have any motivation to do anything and whenever i have mental breakdowns I tend to have a extremely strong urge to self harm. I guess I just want advice since I stopped therapy since it wasn't helping me. Idk anymore
121,My friend wanted to kill herself last night,"Hi guys,

I'm a little stressed right now. Last night at two in the morning a friend of mine messaged me telling me that she wanted to kill herself. We've spoken about this in the past before. She always has suicidal thoughts and she handles them very well, but last night was different. She was very, very close. On the brink of doing it even. I'm truly honoured she felt she could trust me with the information, but that's beside the point. 

We spoke for about an hour. Everything in her life feels like it's falling apart and she feels like there's no escape from it. I told her that it sounded more like she wanted an escape from all the pain than to actually die, it's just that incidentally being dead serves that purpose quite finally. We normally talk conceptually, so I feel that what I said is far less tone-deaf than it sounds. I managed to calm her down and get her to go to bed safely. It took a while and I'm glad she couldn't see that I was panicking on the other side of the phone. I tried my very best to speak calmly, clearly, and carefully, choosing to speak concisely instead of overloading her with more words than she needed to hear. I made sure she knew (or at least heard) that she is loved and that there are other ways to deal with the pain and, if she's willing, I'll help her as best as I can. 

She wants to speak to me today. She'll ring me in about half an hour. I'm honestly panicking. Suicide is a topic close to home for me. I suffer from chronic depression and potentially borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder (I'm currently in the process of screening for a more severe mental health condition and those are what I've been told are the two most likely options in my case). I don't know if what I've said to her is the right thing or if I'm going to be able to say the right thing today. 

Does anybody have any tips? I don't want to get this wrong."
122,Yesterday I drank again after being sober for 3 Months,"I told myself that I just needed to relax a little, have a little fun, although I drank alone... Even though it is considered normal to just drink every once in a while, I still feel so guilty, especially since I was alone :/"
123,Am I going insane?,"I’m a medical student in my final year of college. 

It’s been 2.5 months since lockdown began. I live in an apartment complex with my parents and there’s a fairly high concentration of positive cases in my locality, so I haven’t stepped out of my apartment in more than 2 months. 

I’d say I’m a pretty good student. I always stay at the top 10% of my class. But the final year is always extra stressful because of the enormity of portions I have to complete, no thanks to the current complete isolation. On top of that, my parents always keep telling me to study more, put more efforts (despite my telling them that saying things like that only proves to be counterproductive because I get so mentally affected by their comments that I can’t study the whole day). 

My dad has to work from home now, and he gets a lot of business calls. He speaks pretty loudly on call, and listening to him gives me constant anxiety and palpitations. One of the symptoms of mental illness is hypersensitivity to sound, so I wonder? 

I also have a boyfriend, who lives quite far away currently. I find myself consumed by thoughts of insecurity to the point of stalking his best girl friend. Today I found myself crying over a profile photo she had uploaded with him, along with a quote from his favourite new show. 

I’m also incredibly insecure about my body. I have gained a lot of weight in the past year, faced by offhand remarks about it from a lot of people (I know everybody has faced these kinds of things, I’m just saying that I’m not someone who can shrug it off and it affects me a lot), and this lockdown is obviously not helping with the weight gain. 

Some days are fine. Others, when everything comes tumbling down in my head, I get fleeting thoughts of killing myself. I have never attempted anything, these are just thoughts. But they can’t be normal right? 

So, am I going insane? Should I seek professional help?"
124,My Own Experiences with Mental Illness,"Hello all,

I'm really glad to have found a group that's so supportive. I've been battling mental illnesses for years now (I think 7, but possibly longer, I can't really remember that far back). Mostly depression mixed with anxiety. It's been very tough at times and there are a lot of times I didn't think I would make it, but something that I've found has helped me a lot especially in terms of finding my voice and saying what I need to say is writing songs, specifically raps but others as well. If you're creative in some form, I found it can be very helpful to have an outlet such as that. It doesn't have to be songwriting, but any kind of outlet is helpful. I actually wrote a song about my own personal battles called ""The Box in the Mirror"" that talks about some of my lowest points, being hospitalized multiple times, and how it affected my relationships. Honestly a lot of my music is going to be around these topics and more, I just haven't released any of it yet, but I did find it an incredible way to get out what I needed to say and even to get others to understand more of what I'm going through, a new means of communicating since talking about it flat out was so difficult. Hope you all stay positive and I hope any of this information can help or inspire some of you. Take care, and stay strong"
125,Tired of it all : what to live for?,"Hi there, I rarely post on Reddit but i dont know what to hold on to anymore... i mean, i feel the message i hear in general is ""Reach out/Ask for help"" and i've done it, yet there s not much others can do (Psychiatrist, Therapists, Emerge, Hotlines, Friends, Family, etc.)

My first coping mechanism was bulimia, then alcohol, then drugs, and now that im sober it's suicidal ideations... well even if im not sober i get them.

I feel exhausted at age 32. 
I hate working and i dont enjoy much in life.

Idk what to do anymore. It's like, i am not down for life but i dont wanna hurt my closed ones by offing myself.

I wish i could just drink &amp; drug myself to death but that would get messy and definetly hurt them.
Also, i dont want my death to be blamed on substance abuse... it wouldnt be fair as it is in sobriety that death calls me the most.

My hope is going but not completely gone... I guess i wish there was a way to fix my broken self that i dont know about!"
126,Can’t live with my terrible mistake. I hate myself.,"I grew up with a very emotionally abusive mum. Physically abusive on occasion too. She neglected me and didn’t even provide me with essential toiletries. She was very controlling and used to call me names constantly. Things were at their worst in my teen years. 

My dad was lovely but worked very long hours and never saw the abuse to its full extent. 

I wasn’t spoken to about periods, sex or anything else. I was never bought a tampon or sanitary towel. My teen years were just horrendous. 

Anyway, when I was 14, I heard about something sexual at school. I was curious as to what this would feel like so tried it out at home. I should add that this didn’t involve any other child or adult and happened once. The thing I did was very very wrong but it seemed so insignificant at the time. I didn’t understand what I was doing and that it was wrong.

I completely forgot about what I had done until recently (18 years later). At first, I questioned whether it was a real memory or not as it was so vague but having thought more about it, I know it’s real. 

I physically hate myself and feel disgusting. I have a lovely husband and 2 beautiful kids. I don’t know how I can carry on with life knowing what I did. 

A close family member committed suicide so I know I couldn’t put my family through that but at the same time, I know I won’t feel at peace until I die and I feel like me dying will be a blessing for me, my husband and my kids. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting. I just feel so lost, scared and alone."
127,"I'm feeling selfish and tired of my life in general, i don't know what to do","I don't know why i am writing this but i felt like i had to, i don't like the country where i was born and the people around me, people keep talking about college and life after high school all the time and i don't have any motivation besides doing the things that i like and if i talk about it i just end up getting ignored, i have been feeling like this for a long time and never got help, i feel like i'm just complaining about everything and being selfish, my parents don't wanna listen to me and i don't have any good friends, i feel like i'm gonna end up hurting someone."
128,Sudden changes in energy and mood,"I have been having moments where I'm pumped up for the day with plans of accomplishing much, when all of a sudden my energy goes from 100 to 0. I crawl into bed and just lie there. I'm on antidepressants and valium for sleep. What could be the cause?"
129,My guilty conscience is eating me up,"Hey guys! Today I woke up and finally admitted to myself that I can’t take it anymore. My mental health is on the edge. 
This is going to be a long story so please bear with me.


8 Years ago I had a pretty hard period in my life. I met a girl online, we’ve texted for a whole year and fell in love. She was more than 8000km away from me. At one point I said fuck it, bought plane tickets and met with her. And it was the best thing I ever did in my whole life. We were like meant for each other. I’ve never met a person that would understand me as she did, she was my life saver at one moment. 



So after our first meet up I had to go back to my country. As I was 20 at the time and she 19 we didn’t have much money to visit each other very often. I would buy plane tickets for her every 4-6 months and she would visit me for a month or two. This went on and on for over 3 years. 


She was studying linguistics and chose to study my language so she could later come to my country and become a teacher. 



She really wanted to be with me, she did everything she could to get a scholarship in my country and she did it! Although it costed almost 9000€ I worked my ass of to get that money for her. It was simple, she gets the scholarship (1 out of 300 ppl get it) and I try to bring that money up. 
Well, I fucked up and could only come around with 5000€, her parents offered us to sell their apartment to help with the rest of the money as they were not rich at all. I denied that offer. 


As everything went not as we planned, I told her that we could try it next year and I would have more time to get that money for us.



I started to work my ass if even harder, and oh boy, what a turn did my life take in this one year. 
Our relationship got a little bit stale, we didn’t fight a lot but I stopped caring as much about her as about my work. 



At work I met someone. She was clever, made me smile and would occasionally make me feel that what I am doing matters again. We shared the same hobby’s, loved the same art. There was an exhibition of Rubens in our town, my favorite artist, so was hers. She invited me to go as I was the only one she knew who shared her love to old paintings... well you can imagine where we ended up. It was a one time thing, but we catchend feelings for each other. I didn’t tell her that I have someone.




As time went on, me and my girlfriend started to fight over the smallest things, we loved to play games together but at the end if I saw her online, I would immediately go offline just not to talk to her. 


A few months before I got the whole sum to pay for her scholarship we somehow managed to brake up. She didn’t felt loved anymore, I didn’t felt that working off my ass for her somehow mattered. 


I started a relationship with this girl from my work and we are still together, I love her and she loves me, after 3 years of our relationship we never fought, we respect each other and we are planning to get married soon. 


Here’s the catch, I can’t let go of the thoughts what would happen if I worked on my previous relationship, what if that girl was the one and I fucked everything up. 


A year ago I started dreaming about her. Occasionally one or twice a week I dream about us being together again, in the dreams we are happy. So 6 months ago she contacted me and told me that after all these years she still thinks about me as the one. She met a few guys but it never was like that what we had. 
I took the chance and told her about the shit I did, that i met someone whilst we were still together and that I am still with that women. This broke her heart, I could hear it in her voice. I felt so sorry that I almost cried myself. 


The coming clean didn’t work out as planned and I still have dreams with that one girl. I just can’t let her go. I don’t know how. I feel more guilty now for breaking her heart. All these years in a healthy relationship with my new girlfriend I worked on my personality, I want to become a better human being and never to get in a situation like this again. 


Today I dreamed about my ex again, she was crying, I woke up and felt miserable. I don’t know what to do. The closest closest person to me is my fiancé and will definitely not tell her that my thoughts of my ex are tearing me apart. 
I hope that time will let me forget her and what happened. 

I don’t know why I am posting this, maybe it’ll help to let my thoughts out and make me feel a little bit better."
130,I feel like shit these days because I don’t have focus in life anymore...,"I don’t have any friends here, also the world crisis. I used to imagine having a hobby, read books work towards some personal things I always wanted to learn once I graduate. But now I am a graduate and work so the remaining free time is just me lazing around and I am not even focusing on exercising, reading or anything for that matter. And my job is contract basis which is ending soon also I am kind of an introvert which I hate too. And just today I saw several Elon musk docs and I just couldn’t hold back tears because I used to be this passionate person few years ago about learning about new techs and advancement in science also am very ambitious person but all this is of no use if I don’t teach myself new things anymore."
131,idk man,"i dont know if im delusional and maybe im just lying to myself and trying to convince myself that im a good person. i have too many intrusive and disgusting and petty and cruel thoughts. i lie, im fucking manipulative and sly to get what i want. i don't think of others, i think of doing stuff for them so i can lie to myself that i am better than them. thats probably the only thing ill ever excel at, making excuses and lying to myself. my sister is good at sports and shes super hardworking. my younger sis is smart and confident. and me? i pretend to be the most obedient but i fake studying, play games which i dont even improve in and act like im pro, and i suck at sports and pull the whole team down. i blame others for my own mistakes, but i don't acknowledge that it's just me who is not good enough and that i just suck. instead, i wallow in self pity and blame others for being insensitive and toxic, when im the one whos fucking toxic af. im mean to people, i act fake and pretend to be nice. i notice stupid things that ppl wont notice and feel bad even though its not even an insult or anything. and im the one whos fucking toxic and lying and a bitch. i dont even try. i dont put in effort. instead i lie to myself and make excuses that i have ""depression"", cut myself to be ""cool"". i wish i wasnt born a girl, because i hate being weak. i like talking to guys more because they're more fun but it's difficult. i cry way too easily over small stuff that no one notices. somedays i dont know anymore. im probably just lying to myself that i actually do have something. idk man, but still. im sorry its just a rant and nothing else of substantial use. but thanks for reading i guess"
132,I can not do this shit anymore,"Hello I am struggling with OCD compulsive side and have had a counting habit for years. This has gotten worse lately and I have started working a full time job six says a week ten hours a day except Saturday in which I work five hours. The pay is 8.00 an hour and I am working at a marine cleaning boats. My counting habits arose more lately I feel from thinking about my past. I have done some terrible things and seen some messed up things in a sexual sense. I am rude and then feel bad about it later. Now this might sound crazy but this is how I can explain it. I have been in three bigger and what I see as somewhat real relationships with women (I used to catfish people and talk to people online and through video chats but I am considering people I have dated in real life) but two of these were not very long. I am with my girlfriend of two and a half years now and I have talked to other people during our relationship online but she has told me to get over it and to move on and to not talk about it and she says she has forgave me. I feel bad about it still and wish I could undo it but I as we all know can not go back and change it. Seems like I put meaning on to certain numbers. This is not a set in stone meaning and it changes often. Right now is I see one as the first person I was with of the three two as the second one and three as my current girlfriend. I count 1-6 then 1-3 then 1-2 and I do that three times sometimes nine times I say 1,2,3,4,5,6 1,2,3 1,2 and I say that three times totaling it to 33 because 6+3+2 is 11 I know it is confusing but it seems to help me stay sane and if I do not do it I worry. My girlfriend and I just graduated high school and we had a senior tea event and I saw one of my exes the first one in a dress and I recalled what it looked like and said it looked nice but as you could guess my girlfriend does not like me talking about my exes and it upset her that I remembered what my exes dress looked like. I repeat these numbers so much it is almost manic. I see a therapist and am on medicine but it does not really seem to be helping much. I want my girlfriend to be happy and she already has horrible issues such as BPD self hate and self esteem issues along with being very suicidal and depressed and dealing with sexual trauma in her past. This counting stuff is driving me crazy and I can not do things without panicking and worrying about things very often just overall. Please if anyone has advice share it."
133,Trouble adjusting to being a single mother,"I have a beautiful 11 month old boy that I love more than words but I'm really struggling. The last 18 months have been the worst of my life (finding out I was the other woman, cutting off contact with the father, difficult pregnancy, emergency C-section, nicu, mom has terminal cancer, feeling abandoned by my family and friends). I don't have much support, when I'm not working I am with my son. All I can think about is how hard this is, how hard the future is going to be. It feels like my life is over. How can I shift my focus and start feeling more positive about the future? I know the negative thoughts are making things feel worse than they really are but I just can't stop the cycle."
134,What treatment or medication have you had success with and would you recommend I consult with my doctor?,
135,Maybe I could have been more mentally stable,"I have recently been diagnosed with several mental illnesses, including Bipolar type 1. 

I am 28. When I was 14, I told my mom I thought I was bipolar. She already knew I was regularly self harming. She did nothing. Now I also have a severe anxiety disorder as well. 

I can't help but be angry at my mom. I feel like if I hadn't been ignored and she had gotten me the help I needed instead of laughing it off, I'd be so much healthier mentally. I definitely wouldn't be as anxious about practically everything, and my bipolar definitely would have been under control by now."
136,I was about to drop out of university!,"I don't know how common this is, but whenever I overthink and panic. I make irrational decisions and regret them straight away. Well, recently I almost made an irrational decision but didn't and proud of myself! 

Due to this pandemic, has played havoc on my university work as it's all outside photography. So in March, I had to re-plan everything. Having dyslexia, I have added support for writing plus with me being out of education for a while - it takes me a while to adjust. *Anyway*, I applied for Extenuating Circumstances which instead of the deadline being 1st May, it became 25th June. 

The time is running out and I personally thought I was too far behind to complete. I had thoughts that I was completely useless at university and that I should quit whilst ahead. I emailed my support mentor just asking to drop out of university. I felt really low, overthinking everything. 

But, she then dropped me an email explaining that I'm doing fine and that I'd be slow at adjusting to university life after being out of education for a while. My thought process was normal and everyone she knew who had that thought process has been fine! 

I've not completed the work yet, but her long email gave me the motivation needed to continue. I'm now happy with my progress and very glad I didn't drop out, and gave it time and thought - unlike all the previous decisions I've made when I thought ""this is the only choice left"".

Everyone in my year are receiving their grades today, I've yet to even hand anything in yet - but it doesn't matter. It's not how fast I finish the work, as long as I get the work completed by the deadline, I'm happy with that."
137,Anyone with sex-themed OCD?,"I'm a 23-year-old gay man. I can't remember a single day without anxiety. 

I've had OCD my entire life (I only recently realized that). From weird blinking and walking rituals when I was a kid to unreasonable obsessive health concerns (cancer, HIV in my teen years). Recently, it started to manifest into obsessive sexual thoughts (like the fear of being straight or trans). 

Being a woman is my biggest fear, probably, and my brain is torturing me with incessant thoughts. Yes, I know that OCD-driven thoughts are the opposite of what we want because they are terrifying (I'm a masculine man), but I just keep revisiting my childhood memories when I occasionally fantasized about being a girl (because they were only girls in my class and I wanted to be the baddest bitch, lol) or being called a girl because of my meek character by my bullies and parents. The fact that I prefer being a bottom doesn't help. 

Anyone else experiencing them? I'm specifically interested in gay men. I'm talking to my therapist, listening to OCD-related content, but it hardly helps.

It feels like HELL. I caught myself smashing my head against the table the other day. 

I would be very grateful if somebody could help me."
138,Testosterone injections for social anxiety - any experience?,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to know if anyone has experience with testosterone injections and its effects on (social) anxiety?

I know T injections shut down endogenous T production and you may have to take them life long.

I am aware of that but nothing so far has helped me...I tried every medication, supplements, Psychotherapy, Exposure therapy, Electroconvulsive therapy, TMS, kratom, phenibut, microdosing etc....so there are no treatment options left....

So please, if you have experience I would be glad to hear from you.

(my T levels are in the normal range)"
139,Was I molested?,"I just turned 19 for context. So when I was 12(Male) I was at my uncles cottage and I was in the lake with the neighbour’s kid who was ~3-4 years older than me I think, and we were play fighting kind of. He brought us to a place in the lake that was covered by trees so no one could see us, and he pulled me towards him and wrapped his legs around mine and held them closed. He was holding my wrists before he reached down and started touching/grabbing me through my swim trunks which were just soccer shorts. I don’t know how many times he touched me, I just remember him touching me and me thinking it was an accident, so I kind of stuck my butt out and crouched over so he couldn’t “accidentally” touch me again. But then he did touch me again and that’s when I saw him smiling at me. I was trying to escape and I was saying stop. It didn’t last very long I don’t think and he didn’t really do anything but touch and grab me. It was all really shocking and confusing. Was it molestation?"
140,"I know its very easy to get depressed during this lockdown situation, but I started studying Psychology during this period to collect and evaluate my thoughts properly.

141,im starting to fear for my own mental health,"i know this may seem edgy, sorry but i really want to get this off my chest, im really starting to worry about my own mental health, i live in an abusive and controlling family, i was physically and verbally abused for years, and they're really intrusive, sometimes i feel like i dont have any privacy at all. and all this had made me feel alot of aggression towards my family. I dont really have alot of friends or anyone to talk to (like 2 or 3 people) and ive been through alot of relationships thats not been very good. there were nights where i was really tired and i just cant hold it in anymore and i cry for the whole night, i dont get much sleep in general but it made me feel worse. ive also develop a a fascination for mass shootings and shooters, and also hitler and world war 2 and all that shit. these past few months ive been feeling quite alot of aggression towards people, sometimes i would dream about me shooting up some place and thinking about how i would do it, im really dont want to hurt anyone and i wanna think ab out this anymore."
142,How do I stop feeling so much existential dread in these horrible times?,The world is such an ugly place right now. I despise everything that is happening to it and it is seriously making me feel more and more desperate with every passing day.

145,Work Issues,"I got sick with Corona back in April and being home for 2 weeks was amazing on my psyche. I have a few mental illnesses that result in my phobia and general disinterest in being outside and near people. I find it confusing and disorienting, but despite all my illnesses and symptoms, I do not qualify for Disability.

Anyway, since I've been back at work, my attendance has been really shotty, and I just feel worse than ever being there. The masks are not an issue for me, workload is the same... I just am struggling more. I think being away and seeing my mental health improve has just been a major eye opener and knowing it could be better if I could just convince my shitty government that I need Disability I'd be ok. Because, I only work 3 days a week, occasionally 4 and I only work 5 hour shifts. My husband works full-time which is how we make rent. But if I flat-out quit, we couldn't afford to live.

I work retail pharmacy, which is a horrible environment for someone like me. But the pay is good for my dismal hours and sudden call offs or early departure from my shifts, and I can't seem to find better work for similar pay. I take public transportation out of fear of driving. Plus we couldn't afford another car."
146,My Friend's brother is cutting himself and her family doesn't know. What should she do?,"I'm not sure what to do. My friend came to me on discord one day and told me. Let me explain, we're going to replace the names because I'm pretty sure she doesn't want people to know it's her. I'm going to call her Maria. 

She and her brother are not very close. Maria's brother is cutting. Maria doesn't know what to do when she sees him cut himself. From her texts, it seems she may have told her mother but her mother replied with, ""Let him die slowly."" I know, it seems insane. Maria's really bad at giving advice or comfort so she never told him that she knew. She tried explaining to him that his mistakes don't make him a bad person and he doesn't have to feel bad. Maria told me he doesn't even *care* about her. One of her friends told her about Chronic Stress and how high blood pressure may trigger heart attacks or strokes. 

I asked about her dad, I asked her, ""Does he know about...everything?"" Maria replied that she didn't want to involve her parents, I'm not sure if it's a good idea because it seems her mother doesn't care and I'm not sure about her father. See, usually, Maria's mom picks her up and before the Coronavirus, she seemed like a nice woman but perhaps it was a facade? I'm really not sure. 

She just sent me this picture.

152,I was raised by narcissistic abusers and I am attempting to correct negative reactions to other people in my life,"I know it's long but please give a thoughtful read and be as thorough with a response to the individual questions and details of them. Thank you

For years I have struggled with discipline, due to the majority of parental figures and authoritative figures in my life using negative, non-empowering and destructive punishment. I have since struggled with my mental health and it reached a tipping point sometime last week. I got into a verbal altercation with my partner and their parents.

To the point that I realized I was being emotionally abusive. I'm not okay with that.

So if I have your attention I'd like some advice.

I've never been able to hold a job down and all of my attempts at building new skills and sticking to the task at hand has always fallen through. I am on another endeavor to teach myself another skill, however I am fearful that I wont have the discipline necessary to fulfill the task. I need this vicious cycle of patterns to stop.

I cannot afford therapy but have been looking.

I need practical advice more than anything in this moment. I am seeking therapy, counseling, etc. But in the meantime I would appreciate an analytical approach to the issue of finishing what I start.

I know there is positive reinforcement but I know nothing about discipline without negative punishment, as to say non-constructive punishment, as i was never really taught. That point in my life left no room for the important lessons and conditioning that instills responsibility or discipline.

When I'm very passionate about something I can actually hyper focus on it to the point of neglecting responsibilities in my life.

So I wanted to know what the logic behind discipline is, how I can teach myself now that I'm an adult without reinforcing the negative trauma associated with my upbringing, and what part(s) of the brain control the emotions discipline (when done right) evokes?"
153,Am I Getting Better Or Is It All the Same,"I've been dealing with PTSD, Major Chronic Depression and Anxiety since I was 10 years old- maybe younger. I did this thing when I was in highschool where I buried all the trauma and negative emotions and it helped for a while. But then a couple of years ago it's like my brain shut down and was like ""we can't do this anymore"" and all my problems came back worse than ever before. 

I'm on a combination of six different medications and they seem to be working. My negative thoughts are far less frequent now, but there is still one major problem- i'm terrified of the general public. Going places, meeting new people, talking on the phone with strangers... All if it makes my heart race and my anxiety skyrocket. So on one hand I feel like I'm getting better in terms of motivation, no self harm, and no calls to the void (at least not as frequently). Generally I am happier- but on the other hand doing basic everyday adult things freak me out and I can't handle it. I have to have my fiance drive me places because I'm at a point where even just driving is terrifying.

I don't even know what this post is about. I just needed to say something somewhere."
154,"Has Anyone Else Experienced This? (Walking with no shoes, showering fully clothed, etc)","Hi all,  


I don’t normally post on Reddit, but I would like to get some outside opinions on a situation.  


A friend of mine’s brother in his mid-twenties has been going through a huge struggle with mental health for years now. He has struggled socially since his teens and has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder. He has been on and off many different medications although he is currently is not on any.  


He has seemed a little clumsy or forgetful when doing chores such as cooking in the past but lately, things have escalated. He has wandered outside late at night, leaving the door wide open, and appears confused when found. He has also been leaving the house and walking places with no shoes on. When asked about this, he simply responds, “Don’t worry about it.” He has even showered fully clothed. He does not seem to think or understand anything is strange about any of this behaviour. This is all entirely new for him and not something he has done before. He has also gotten increasingly more irritable, yelling, and destroying personal belongings in small fits of rage.    
 

He has been to many doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers and currently has one of each. He has also constantly been in and out of mental health facilities. The facility where I live is known for being especially awful and letting people out when they should be kept for further evaluation or care. They are saying that the behaviour is deliberate but even if this were the case, wouldn’t there still be some underlying issues to address? The family personally does not feel that it is deliberate and has stated that he seems disoriented and as if he is not even the same person.   
 

Has anyone heard of or experienced any symptoms like this? Or have any suggestions of what could be going on? I’m not looking for a diagnosis, as mentioned, he has the medical professionals for that. However, I am curious if anyone else has experienced or heard of anything like this and if so, what was it in that case?   
   
I’m basically looking for any words or resources I can use to help the family or help them bring up a conversation with a professional or something. It has been very stressful for everyone involved. I hope he can get the help he needs and want to do what I can to help.   
 

Thanks for your time!"

156,Don't Know If It's Just Me,"Hey guys,

I've been feeling this way for a while now. I wanted to post here and see if I really am the only one.

So a few years back I had really bad depression and anxiety and it reached the point of nervous breakdown. I have been on medication ever since, and things have been going really well for the most part. I've been responding well to the meds, and most of my symptoms are gone. 

But there's one thing thats been bugging me. I feel like once my motivation left, it never really came back. I used to be a really good student and a great pianist. Now I don't feel like studying anymore. I don't feel like playing the piano anymore. It's so weird. I'm not sad or anything, but my depression lead to so many failures that it kind of turned into a self fulfilling prophecy, if that makes any sense at all. Like I haven't done well at anything in such a long time that I can't imagine myself doing well again. Sorry if that doesn't make any sense at all.

TLDR; depression symptoms are gone but still lack motivation"
157,My friend is depressed but won’t get help,One of my friends has been super depressed since the outbreak and I’m starting to get worried. She says she doesn’t feel like herself anymore and she doesn’t get any sleep. She is talking to her friends less and less and whenever I ask what’s wrong she ignores me. The one time I got her to hear my advice she said she could handle it by herself. How do I convince her to get help
158,how do i stay good,"usually reddit is really comforting i can relate to people, i can try to advice people with things therefore making me feel connected to someone, i can see nice things, etc but today is bad and weird and everything here that i encounter that is negative affects me a lot more than usual. things like someone calling someone a ‘whore’ makes me cry because i realise so suddenly how judgmental the world is and i feel so scared and sad to be in it. obviously what’s going on in the states too is really horrible and i don’t know what to do basically regarding reddit and how much time i spend on it. i think i just need someone to say it is indeed okay because it doesn’t feel like it there is so much bad and usually i can say hey it’s okay there’s good too but nothing feels good enough to go against the awful bad. thank you for reading it was very nice of you &lt;3 have a 🍰"
159,Im worried that I'm not eating enough.,"So, I've been VERY stressed about quarantine. I think that's part of it. I never have felt like I'm over weight, I've actually slimmed down a lot from a few years ago... but since quarentine, I've lost lots of weight.
I'm a 13 year old boy, and I'm 98 pounds. I'm very afraid. If I stretch my arms up I can see my ribs a little. It's not that I'm not eating, like an eating disorder... I'm just not getting hungry, like at all. I dont eat during the day cause I'm not hungry. And at night. I'll eat a little but that's it. I've been drinking lots of water. I'm just afraid, and I dont know how to eat more."
160,Talking out,Does anyone else have the problem of not being able to speak to family or friends about your problems even when confronted on them but you can let loose of a gaming friend half way across the world without a second thought
161,I haven’t felt this alone and helpless in years,"Before I go on my rant, I will preface by saying I do have a therapist I work with on a weekly basis and am seeking the help I need during this time.

It has taken me a long time, but this quarantine has made me look at my problems straight in the face and accept that I have an eating disorder. For years, I would say that I suffer from “disordered eating behaviors” because I would go through periods of starvation, but never be underweight. But now, I can’t really avoid the fact that I struggle with food, I don’t eat and some days it really feels like looking at the end of a barrel when it comes to having to eat at all. 

Before quarantine, I considered myself having been recovered for 3 years. I would eat like a normal person. I would eat enough most days, and eat over my recommended intake on days I wanted to treat myself. During those 3 years, I would rarely not eat, and if I realized I wasn’t eating, I would immediately remedy it and properly address my stress. Now, with the 70+ days of quarantine, I’ve easily starved for 75% of the time, barely eating but eating enough so I don’t pass out. I’ve lost a little under 10% of my starting weight which for my size, can be considered a significant loss even though I’m not near being underweight. 

I realized my biggest crutch was going to the gym. My therapist and I have been discussing that I would go to the gym 4-6 times a week, and burn (what I thought was a low, normal amount) a ton of calories. I would usually eat enough to maintain my weight, but I was still burning more than someone my age and size should be doing on a daily basis. 

Now, I’m scared. I’m scared because after hiding this from my family since I was in high school, they’re starting to notice I’m not eating. They comment everyday how I’m losing weight. My boyfriend is worried about me. I’ve always had to deal with this struggle alone enough though I’ve confided in people over the years about it. A lot of the times, what it comes down to, is that they just tell me to eat. I understand they’re only trying to help, but I makes me feel like a failure when I can’t stomach the idea of eating.

I know that the logical, simple answers are all in front of me. They are the facts and mantras I had about food that powered me through recovery. I know it would be really hard for me to gain a significant amount of weight (unless I binged often, which I don’t). I know the simple answer is to just eat. But I can’t. I haven’t felt like I can’t in so long. It’s so hard to explaining my mindset to my boyfriend, and I know he’s frustrated with me. He’s trying so goddamn hard to help me and I feel like every time I choose not to eat, I’m failing not only him but my loved ones and myself. But when I do chose to eat, it’s awful. I get physically uncomfortable. I feel anxious, a level anxiety I haven’t felt since I was in college when I had to eat. 

I’ve been talking to my therapist about all of this. He says he isn’t comfortable giving me an official diagnosis (other than anxiety) until I’ve spoken with their psychiatrist because there are multiple layers to what I’ve been dealing with. But even he admitted that he believes that I do have some eating disorder, or even OCD since I obsess and have intrusive thoughts specifically around food and exercise.

It’s a lot. I’m unsure what to do most days. I feel myself closing off to everyone I love most, even my boyfriend. I don’t know how to talk about this stuff anymore, even with the person I feel most vulnerable with. I’ve tried talking to him, but I feel like most times I do, he becomes frustrated (understandably so) or he just says he can’t talk to me anymore about it. 

I guess I just wanted to get it out in the open, because at least then I’m not feeling trapped in my own head about it. And again, I’m seeking the help I need during this time and I hope all of you are seeking the help you need too."

163,Feeling a bit lost and hopeless.,"Hello to the community,

I feel a bit lost lately and I do not know how to overcome the way I feel. I am 29 and I currently do my master thesis in my favorite subject. Due to the situation is hard to meet with supervisors physically and we meet online which does not help at all.  The to dos are keep getting more and more while I fight alone with no help. I discussed it with the but they all blame coronavirus lately. This puts more pressure on me because I am worried about my future career and opportunities..I was thinking to tell them that I need to take some time off since the situation does not help at all! 

In addition to that, 3 months ago I broke up with my girlfriend while I was in an exam period. Was the worst think EVER. She left with no reason and said goodbye via message. To be honest, this killed me deep inside. After we broke up I could not sleep at night for almost 2 months and I was dreaming about her. She follows me on insta and social media and she continues to like my photos and whatever I post..

In the meantime, I live far away from my home country and I cannot go back home at the moment. There are no flights going there and I am trapped in my studio since there is lockdown over here.

I just wanted to share my thoughts. Thank you for reading my post. Stay safe and be kind to each other Xx"
164,Medical fee for Psychiatrist. Depression and Dream.,"My dream is to be certified as a tax accountant in Japan and have my own business to help foreigners who would like to open businesses in Japan.

There must be many people who want to move to Japan but are unable to do so due to the language barrier and local regulation.

But that dream has put on hold because of the worst and terrifying experience while I was living in a country in South East Asia.

I got scammed by loan sharks - illegal moneylenders. 


I moved to this country one year and half years ago for my career. I was also studying to be a certified accountant.


And I needed a loan for tuitions. The bank couldn’t lend me because I was still new to the country.


And I found the website for a loan institution. I have provided my phone number and they have called me. I applied for a loan, and instantly approved. I was skeptical. After hearing the loan term. It was shocked that the interest rate is more than 30% in a weekly rate (not annual rate).


I refused and requested for the cancellation. They yelled at me. I was terrified. Then, they demanded a cancellation fee of doubled loan amount. I kept refusing to pay. But they harassed me by telling me to reveal all my personal information and the fact that I borrowed money illegally to my company and on the internet.

I did not know what to do but took a weekly loan. This was their strategy.

A week later, I paid off by paying the sky-rock interest. Then they started sending me money without my loan agreement. From that point, I was trapped. For the last 10 months or so, I suffered from their harassment and debt has increased to around approx. USD20,000, which started with that first loan USD2000.

I have been mentally depressed since then and became suicidal since April 2020. I could not confess this to my family, friend, and company because I was very ashamed of myself.

And I no longer be able to pay the illegal lenders. The harassment has escalated. I attempted the suicide for a couple times. But of course I couldn’t. I am a weak person.

On May 10th, 2020, My choice was to kill myself or ask for help.


At this moment, I hadn’t have a good sleep for a month, and I couldn’t eat at all. Due to Covid-19, I was stuck in my room. And I was just staring outside all day.

But somehow, I was writing to my friends and family in Japan for help. They bought an airplane ticket for me right away, and I escaped from the country next day.

I am back in Japan but still very much depressed. Sometimes I still think about disappearing.

however, I try to think positive. I still want to achieve my dream. 


Due to the illegal lenders, my personal debt has increased because I was paying them using my credit cards and savings etc. 

now I am back home in Japan. I want the second chance to restart my life from scratch, and work hard toward my dream.


I would like to ask you for favor of monetary support for doctors’ visits and recover also from the debt


Thank you so much,

T"
165,I am tired of being numb.,"I don’t know how to stop it.

I wake up and lay in bed for hours until I have to get ready for work. I work all day and I can be fine. I can laugh and talk and be upbeat and happy.

Then I get in the car and drive home, in silence. I sit in bed and don’t turn on the tv, just mindlessly scroll on fb or reddit until I sleep for the night, and do it all again the next day.

I don’t want to clean my house. I don’t want to play with my dogs. I don’t go out with my friends, or play games, watch tv, paint, hike, anything like I KNOW I should.

I have no motivation, no drive to actually get up and live.

I’m scared of taking medicine, but I’m so tired of sitting in silence being so damn numb. My life is flying by and I’m missing all of it because I can’t get out of bed.
What can I do..? How do I fix this?"
166,My Friend/Roomate is acting really strange,"I have a roommate, in this post I'll call him ""Mike"". Mike is usually very normal, but recently he's been worrying us. Two nights ago my roommates, a friend of mine who was crashing here, and I were watching (but mostly ignoring) back to the future II and chatting. We were talking about the anti-police protests going on around the US, and Mike had a lot to say (Mike is Hispanic). I tried to listen to what he was saying, but he was not making much sense. He kept talking about how we were all slaves, and that people were starting to wake up. Specifically, he kept telling us that ""his eyes were open"". This was my first hint that something was wrong. Later in the night I saw Mike's eyes welling up before he rushed himself to the bathroom, I tried to ask him if everything was okay but didn't get a response. Another thing that stands out to me about this night was the date he kept repeating- July 4th. Mike seemed convinced that a revolution would start on July 4th. I tried to ask him about this, why he thought something was happening on July 4th, but did not get a satisfactory response; Mike seemed worried that our various electronic devices were listening to our conversations.

The next day brought something more troubling. Mike walked up to me and confronted me- he said he knew I was planning something for June 1st. My other roommate, concerned at hearing this, sat us all down for a discussion. After talking some more, we found out that Mike thinks me and the friend I invited are involved in a conspiracy or terrorist plot of some kind. My roommate and I tried, in the gentlest way possible, to dissuade him of these ideas but to no avail. Ever since then Mike will sometimes walk up to me and ask me what my plans are. (every time I answer the truth- absolutely nothing)

I'm starting to get very spooked by this. This came completely out of the blue for all of us, I'm worried that Mike is going to a bad place, or will try to ""stop"" me somehow."
167,"As someone who suffers from severe social anxiety, how do I combat the phrase ""Silence = Compliance""?","Ever since this protest shit has gone down, I've been terrified to leave home. I'm scared I may accidentally wander into an altercation of some sort in public, and because I'm too scared to say or do anything,  get judged and called a ""racist"" or ""fascist"" for enabling it. I can't help that I'm a coward and I can't use ""mental illness"" as an excuse because that almost sounds laughable compared to being shot and killed."

My sleep schedule is absolutely ridiculous, I go to sleep in the late morning sometimes early afternoon and wake up at night like 8 or 9pm. Idk what I'm feeling really, am I anxious? Depressed? It could be that I've been in my house for a month straight and haven't gone anywhere. I don't currently have a job so I hardly leave the house.

Majority of the people i live with are addicts and people who put in a effort to bring me down whether if physical or mental. I been taking drugs to cope with it but its only temporary. I havd attempted suicide once but i was stopped and i have a hard time telling people bacause my anxiety. I just have no clue how to stop the voices in my head telling me to hurt my self or others.

i’ve sorta felt this way for a few years now and there’s not really a specific reason behind why i’m not happy. i feel like they’ve sort of guessed or just assumed i feel this way and they do check in with me to see if i’m okay, but i just don’t want them to feel like it’s their responsibility to “cheer me up” or “fix me”.

Now, one of those friends have seemed to gotten more enjoyment from talking to other people and we haven’t been speaking much and it’s really making me depressed.

A friend will tell me they're suicidal and want to die and I'll encourage them to seek help but they'll refuse and tell me it won't help them and nothing I say to them will make it better so I'm always just like ...why did you tell me then? It makes me massively stressed out and scared for the person and it really frustrates me that they won't even take my advice. I tried expressing this to a friend once and they got super mad at me and basically dropped me from their life. I mean if telling me helps them not kill themselves then they should but it just makes me feel awful and I'm so tired of it happening to me because I hate being the only one with the knowledge that this person might hurt themselves. This happened to me multiple times and just happened again with someone I really care about and I just don't know what to do.
178,How To Be There For A Friend When She Makes It Difficult,"Hello.

Some background.

We are both in college but go to different universities in different states.  I know her from highschool and the last time I've seen her in person was graduation.  In our senior year, for whatever reason, I decided to open up to her more about my own mental health issues.  This caused me to be extremely fond of her.  We reconnected around a year ago after I got a message from her.  I will admit that I did have a crush on her in highschool which made things strange and ever since reconnecting I have gotten those feelings back, but now I'm unsure about it.  I wasn't sure if mentioning this was important, but I figured the more context the better.  I have depression and anxiety, especially when it comes to people and making friends.  Her mental health issues, which I don't want to go in detail about out of respect for her, are much worse than mine.  On to the main issue:

I have decided that regardless of how I feel about her, I still want to be there for her as a friend.  I don't want to bail on her because of something she can't control.  However, she is not making it easy.  She does this strange thing where she will ""isolate"" herself and essentially ghost me and has done this multiple times for various lengths of time.  She says that she does this to everyone, and I have no reason not to believe her.  She also knows that she shouldn't be doing that and knows that it's just her mental health issues getting the better of her.  The last time she did this, I didn't hear from her for almost three months.  I would call and text because I wanted to know if she is ok, but all I would get was radio silence.  This would be hard on me because I would start to think that she just doesn't want anything to do with me anymore or that I messed up or that something horrible happened to her and there would be no way of knowing, etc.   Eventually I  stopped for a while because I thought she might need space and that I realized the constant calling was starting to become pathetic.  After three weeks of leaving her alone, I just decided to try one last time, against my better judgement, and she actually responded.  Anyways I was surprised and  she said she was doing the isolating thing again and that she was sorry and she was going to try better.  I told her it was ok and that I'm here for her and that I understand etc. etc.  Not but two weeks later, and she's doing it again.  I've called and texted several times but I've heard nothing.  It's only been a few days, but I have no idea how long this will last, whether it will be only a few days or months again.  I really want to be there for her because I care about her, but how can I when I can't even talk to her?  Not to mention that I'm the only one who calls and texts.  I'm really the only one who tries to reach out to her, while she never bothers calling me to see how I'm doing.  Sometimes it feels like she just doesn't want me around and she's too afraid to say anything.  So she just ghosts me and hopes I give up.  I know that she has a really hard time and her problems are a lot bigger than mine, but it always seems like I'm the only one putting any effort into this friendship.  Honestly, I wish she would just be honest with me if she really doesn't want me around anymore.  Well I know that it's probably hard to give any sort of advice for something like this, but honestly I'd just like to hear any thoughts you might have on the matter."
179,How can I talk to my mom about seeing a psychiatrist?,"My mom is very conservative and “old school” as they say, she doesn’t think mental health issues are valid problems. She used to get kind of annoyed at me when I would cry when I was younger and say “don’t cry it’s not good for your heart.” I’m almost an adult now and I believe I’ve developed serious mental health issues and I want to speak to a professional about my symptoms so that we can find out what might be wrong with me. How can I talk to my mom about this? I’m scared she’ll get mad at me and deny my feelings and symptoms."
180,What are your thoughts on romanticising mental illness?,"Like depression is artistic, anxiety is cute"
181,Today I made the difference between symptoms and hard time and that I've been traumatized and will need time to heal,"I have BP1, which is pretty stable. Last week I went back to the police station to officially sue my ex. A rude guy told me I couldn't sue for threat of violence, only threat of murder. I panicked, started to cry and ended up leaving. On the initial report I have there's literally written 'I do not wish to sue for now'. Not really legit all that. 

I've been rocky since. I was scared to decompensate but you can be a mess without it be related to mental illness. I forget it often."
182,What are some non triggering shoes and movies please?,Fucking doctor who made me sad for some reason
183,I think I suffer of body dysmorphia and I don’t know how to deal with it...,"hi everyone.
I don’t know if this is the right community to post this on but I will give it a try.

so, since I was a young teenager (f), I have not been skinny but also not fat. I did have curves throughout my teenage years, big thighs and also more breast. I was eating lots of sweets and also fat things and as I went clubbing, I also drank alcohol every other weekend. During my chubbier years I would complain to my mom sometimes that I thought I was getting too fat but eventually, I wouldn’t think about it much as I still liked my curves. I was always particularly proud of my thighs and my butt.

this has completely changed when I moved countries and moved out of my mom’s place 2 years ago. I noticed how with work and education, I didn’t have time to eat as much snacks as I used to and I lost some weight. I have met my boyfriend short after
moving and I notice I eat healthier and due to adult stress and more moving around due to duties, I did some sort of exercise I wasn’t doing before. plus I got diagnosed with anxiety. 

now, I am sure I have lost 10 kg in 2 years. I do still have curves but I am very unhappy with my body. especially nowadays with curves being in focus on beauty, it makes me feel self conscious. everybody tells me I have a good body as it looks more healthy but I am devastated for some reason... I am currently counting my calories and try to make it to 2,000 a day, which is very hard as I just don’t feel as hungry as I did some years ago. I am particularly devastated when I notice my clothes are getting very lose and whenever I look into the mirror, I could cry. At some days, I feel like I gained weight and I am happy. Then the next day, I feel again too skinny. 

I am going to a therapist but due to the pandemic, our sessions aren’t as regular right now and it’s hard to reach out to him whenever...

I wanted to ask, has anybody experience with body dysmorphia and could explain me some psychology behind it? And how to handle those thoughts?"
184,Feeing very heavy.,"I’m 21M. I live with my mother but I was really raised by my grandparents. 

I feel as though I have tricked everyone I know into thinking I’m a high functioning individual. I average Cs at school because I don’t try. I know my potential well and I know I’m capable of getting good grades. But for some reason, I can’t force my learning. High test scores don’t mean anything if I have 0s in everything else, at least to me. I have never done well in school. My standardized testing scores called me gifted, while I was failing off my track and field team in 3 different classes. Fast forward to college, and this semester I nearly failed two classes. My dream is to be the first in my family to pursue higher education, and to break the cycle of the shitty people my family produces. That dream is starting to feel unattainable because of my tanking GPA and mental state.

I can’t talk to my mom about these things. I can’t talk to anyone about these things. And I don’t know why, I have asked myself time and time again. I even secretly have a therapist, but I don’t think I’m going to see her again. It helps but I feel like she tells me things I already know, because I can’t just tell her how I feel. I have many issues stemming from my childhood and emotional abuse (not from immediate family, though). 

I feel my mother is a little spoiled and she is heavily lacking in the empathy department. She had me very young, and this forced her to be dependent on my grandparents. I think this dependency was necessary but the side effects are present. In my life, she effectively plays the role of a very caring sister. I know she loves me but it doesn’t feel like a mother’s love. I think I just got used to being alone, and this causes my thoughts to drift away from reality. I am not sure of who I am. I try very hard to be empathetic and understanding, but i just can’t trust another to do the same. I feel like my life is lacking clarity. And I’m terrified to let someone know that I actually have feelings, for whatever reason."
185,I am not and I am not gonna be.,"I never was and I will never be again,  
I only want to dissapear,  
To be a memory at sunrise."
186,I finally reached out.,"Today, at 29 years of age, and having been depressed since I was 12, I finally reached out to my doctor. I'm expecting a call from them tomorrow. I hope I get the strength and courage to be honest about how I *truly* feel. I definitely feel scared. But also relieved.

Any advice about how to handle this initial conversation on depression and one's mental health will be very welcomed.

If you're suffering from any mental health issue, if there's any distress in your life, if you feel like you can't cope, please reach out to a doctor or mental health specialist. Things will change from the moment you open up."
187,my mental health has been terrible for the past two weeks,"so for the past 2 weeks, i've been waking up really early in the morning (7-8 am which is early for me) no matter how late i sleep (2-4am). this is abnormal for me considering i always sleep a lot (like A LOT). this is ALSO abnormal because whenever i wake up, i ALWAYS feel unnecessarily anxious. not just a queasy feeling, but my heart rate is really high and it's hard to breathe. it takes a while to subside and sometimes i have to poke my head out my window to get fresh air to breathe.

for the past 2 weeks i also havent had an appetite at all. im barely hungry and when i am i dont want to eat anything. ive actually lost a couple pounds!

i honestly have no idea what is going on!!!"
188,How do I help my friend who’s been cutting himself ?,"I have a friend, well actually he’s my friend’s younger brother and recently I’ve gotten closer to him and I treat him like a younger brother that I never had. My friend told me that she found out  her brother have been self harming. He was taking out his frustrations and anger towards his mother on himself. He used to vent his emotions through Taekwondo. However, he injured his opponent badly during training and caused his opponent to have an asthma attack, resulting in him not being able to go back to training for 6 months. And now that the corona virus is going on and all outside activities had been stopped, he was not able to express his intense emotions through Taekwondo which was his only outlet. He doesn’t talk much about his problems because he doesn’t want to seem vulnerable, and he gets angry when people talk to him about it. My friend noticed the cuts but she didn’t confront her brother directly, instead she told her dad which she believes is more understanding than her mother so her dad asked her brother about it but he got angry. As a friend and somewhat as another older sister figure in his life, I am worried about him but he gets angry easily and I don’t want to make him feel like I’m judging him for cutting because I too honestly, understand what he meant when he said he was taking out his anger and frustrations on himself through self harming. I have no idea how to approach this issue because I do not want to see him spiral downwards and I do not wish to see him get hurt. Please, do let me know, what I can do or say to help him. Thank you :,)"
189,I'm so tired of all of this,"I know I'm going to seem like an edgy brat, so feel free to skip this post. I just need to let this out. 

For some reason, I'm extremely sensitive. It's so fucking annoying, I hate it so much. I cry at the littlest of things. I get overwhelmed easily to the point I want to bash my head into the wall until I can't feel anything. I'm constantly dreading the next day. I hate it. I've been getting angry so so easily. Any tiny thing can tick me off and I just want it to end. The world is such a corrupt place. 2020 has by far been the worst year of my life so far. It just keeps getting worse and worse. Is it ever going to get better? Really. The world has been on a decline for years. Is it truely ever going to get better? Or is our society just going to get more corrupt? More irrational hate against innocent people? I thought the world was supposed to be getting better. I don't know what going on. I hate it all. Everyone is so fucking stupid. I'm not saying I'm not stupid, because I know I am too. It's just all so stupid. I rely on other people for happiness. I'm a clingy mess of a person who should just give up already. I. Hate. It."
190,Just tired.,"I'm a 23 year old man. I had a tough childhood, my father beat me up until I was 18. Only me, not my two other siblings. He and my mother would verbally assault me and mistreat me badly, often making me feel like a worthless sack of shit. I was sexually assaulted by family members and strangers at a young age. I was bullied a large part of my childhood, at one of the many schools I went to it got so bad that it made the local newspapers. I was the only latino kid I knew probably anywhere where I live, so I grew up feeling very alone and misunderstood. My parents tried to get rid of me at two or more occassions during my childhood, I always blamed myself for this.

I never performed well in school so I always used to see myself as unintelligent - I later found out that I have ADHD after seeking treatment for my concentration issues, something that my parents and other family members neglect to this day. My parents still mistreat me, I'm still bullied by them, yet still I work for the family business and do everything I can to help maintain the company and continue the legacy. 

Three weeks ago I told my mother I wanted to follow my dreams and become a gardener, she responded by scoffing at it and saying that it sounded ridiculous. I replied playfully that she wouldn't be invited to my graduation the day that I finish my studies. This led to a huge argument where my mother bullied me and disrespected me in every way possible, pushing all of my buttons and humiliating me. I later called my father in desperation and told him that I didn't want to continue working for the family business and that I was only doing it for them, he responded that I was mistaken and that the only reason I was working for them was because I couldn't stand on my own feet and needed them. He told me that my mother doesn't need my help and that at the end of the day, only the two of them mattered. In the midst of his rant I blurted out that I had been sexually molested as a child, he completely disregarded it and told me that he was taking care of his grandchildren and couldn't discuss that at that time. This blew a hole in my heart, I had never felt so lonely in my life. All the pain and neglect I had felt all of my adolescent life was neglected yet again. 

That same night I called my sister and father in law, I told them everything. From the beginning. My sister came by the next day and we talked it out, she told me that she completly understood me, loved me and that she would be by my side whatever I do.

Fast forward to yesterday, mothers day. I went to my parents house and had dinner, all of us pretending that nothing of this was going on. I saw my sister being very loving and caring with my father, everyone being super happy and just pretending that life was good. That was it. The culmination of all the things I've felt my entire life. I felt alone, abandoned, misunderstood and neglected. Yesterday I lost hope for everything, I lost the will to live. My girlfriend tries her best but it's not enough. My entire life is a lie, I'm so ridiculously unhappy. I'm ready to finish it and get rid of this pain. I want all of them to feel my pain and make them feel disgusted with themselves, I want them to be held accountable for their actions. I want them to feel my hurt, my neglect, my endless sorrow. I want to hurt them so bad that they never recuperate. I want to leave nothing behind but a letter where I write the most hurtful things I can imagine and never give them the opportunity to adress it. I want them to feel the hatred that has corrupted my heart. I want them to understand how tired I am.

I'm going to go for a drive and I might never come back. I want to crash into a tree at high speed and end my life. I'm ready."
191,What do I need to tell my manager?,"I've been in and out of therapy/counseling for a very long time, and I've recently felt that it's time to seek outside, professional help again. I've reached out to several therapists/companies and I've finally found one locally with some openings.  


To date, therapy and work have never overlapped, but now it will. What (if any) information do I need to disclose to my manager? My goal is to schedule weekly appointments that are as low impact as possible to my work, but it will require me to miss some amount of work, and I'm assuming my manager should get some amount of heads up concerning reoccurring ""doctors appointments"".  


Any advice?"
192,Anybody else have a baby voice that comes out sometimes involuntarily?,"Maybe it’s just me but when I’m with my boyfriend my “baby” voice comes out. His brother has expressed annoyance with it even though most of the time it comes out it’s behind closed doors in my boyfriend’s room (they share an apartment). So I feel like he should mind his own business. It’s not like I’m switching my identities or anything it’s literally just the pitch of my voice that changes. Sometimes I can’t help it. Like I’ll be on the phone with my boyfriend while at a drive thru and suddenly I’ll accidentally speak to the barista in a baby voice. 

I’m pretty controlled about it but it is something that I’ve done since I was a little kid. I’ve always had a baby voice that I would be reprimanded for when I was a kid and teen. I did it a lot for attention. Part of me hated the thought of growing up so I always regressed. Sometimes I still do. I feel like I always develop emotionally a lot later than my peers have and it’s slowly catching up. Idk if any of this makes sense. 

I’m in therapy for a bunch of reasons so I’m getting the help I need but man, it’s just like if it’s not one thing about my mental health it’s always another."
193,How can I report my psych?,"How do I go about reporting my doctor? She is chronically late for my appointments. I’m talking over half an hour late. Last quarter, she sent prescriptions to my pharmacy and some how they didn’t get it, requiring I go in for another appointment to get new ones for adhd. Now I am waiting for my virtual appointment. I just paid and her office isn’t answering the phone and she is late again. Every time we talk, she has some weird excuse as to why she doesn’t want to give me my prescription. “I thought you said last time it didn’t work for you” “you told me you want to stop taking that” and other random ideas. I’m very frustrated! Someone recommended I report her a while back and now I’m fed up enough to do it."
194,Nagging parents leading to not so great mental health.,"My mom (bless her) loves me alot, I know that, wants only the best for me but her way of ensuring my goodwill is causing me a fair amount of stress and anxiety. I feel almost depressed and am constantly in low spirits. I feel like I have no energy left anymore. I sont know what to do because even after explaining to her that the constant nagging isn't helping, she still doesn't get it and thinks I'm just being rude or a bad child or idk. I have no idea what to do. I feel so head heavy whenever she even starts talking to me now. Please help me."
195,How to not let what is going on in the world effect my mental health?,[deleted]
196,I need help,"I literally don’t have the strength to get out of bed some days. I’m so mentally bogged down that I just feel like not doing anything at all. I’m tired and achy 24/7 and it’s like there’s this voice in my head constantly telling me that no one likes me and that I’m a pathetic failure and a loser who would be better off gone. I can’t stop agonizing over anything— my looks, the fact that I’m going to a state school, my talents, etc.

I’m so close to just giving up and not trying. I’m going off to college and I realize I can’t fucking take four more years in my home state— it’s so damn boring. I’m barely happy anymore."
197,Suicidal,"feeling so suicidal and like I have nothing to live for. Emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive father who puts threats on me and my twin brother, and ruined my relationship with my gf. I feel like theres no point in life when Iwill be controlled even if i went to the police. please help."
198,just a biiiig virtual hug to everyone who needs it rn &lt;3,"We are all going through shit in our heads, shit we don’t want to or aren’t ready to talk about. 
It gets overwhelming and difficult to cope, especially in times like these. 
A big hug to you for just existing and taking the time to reflect and be a better person :)"
199,"Hello, mental health enthusiasts!","**6 people so far from this subreddit (30 in total) have reached out! You could be the next to make a difference!**

(I have gotten approval from one of the moderators to post about this. :)  
Hiya! My name's CJ. I'm 21 years old. I'm an aspiring writer and have a huge interest in mental health. I've been working on an informational book (yet to be named) that more or less encapsulates dozens of known and some unknown mental health/behavioral or otherwise relevant disorders and disabilities that affect how the mind perceives certain situations. 

I need people who are willing to have interviews about disorders/conditions that they may be experiencing. It's a simple 10-question text interview. The purpose of the interview is to provide a first-person perspective on whatever topic the consumer/reader may be looking at. Elect anyone you want for it, just shoot me a message if you're interested!   
Topics available for interview are here: [https://pastebin.com/MGMMkeDh](https://pastebin.com/MGMMkeDh)
Edit : Depression and DID interviews are not available, I've gotten multipme for each already. Anything else is on the table!

I hope to hear from some of you! Stay strong and remember to take care of yourself. You're not alone and deserve to have people around you who care. 🖤"
200,Help me get out of my head. Offer me a different perspective on my life. I do not know how to get help.,"I remember the time. When I used to be excited to wake up and get ready for the day. The day had spontaneity. Who am I going to meet today? What will I learn today? What new wisdom will I acquire from the most unexpected places? I remember going to sleep with a rush of excitement in my heart. I remember waking up with strength and willpower. Pushing my self to get up and learn. All I had to do was show up. And when I showed up, someone will be there to guide and support me. 

The last time I felt this feeling was 3 years ago. Now I go to sleep and my heart feels empty. Confused. Knowing that tomorrow will be similar to the last day. Knowing that the only spontaneity is what I will choose to happen to myself. I wake up empty. What is the point, when no one is there. No one cares. No one will hold my hand, nor guide me. My spontaneous wisdom comes from strangers on YouTube because people don't randomly talk to me on the streets anymore. Like they used to. What happened to mentorship. It feels like money is the driver. If I don't give money for time of another person. No direct face to face mentorship. 

If I don't make money, I get comments from my family. Get a real job. Just Get A Job. Any Job. I get a job and feel sick being indoors. Physically sick without movement. I have the urge to run, at least half of my day. I wake up feeling trapped. It's like being stuck in an asylum of the same day for years. I know I am very capable as a human being. I have to convince employers that I am. I apply to jobs feeling overqualified for the pay. I don't hear back. Surprised because I know I am good enough. Why do I have to convince someone else that I am good enough. That is what drives me insane the most. 

I continue working to improve my skills, because I know no matter how good, there is always room for better. I wake up empty. I want to get out of this trap. I begin my day with a run. Then a coffee. I sometimes convince myself to ignore the fact that I have to spend time making others believe in me, when I already believe in myself. I begin working. Doing the same things as the founders, same tasks as the employers themselves. Because I know I am capable. I finish a hard day of work. Only to be told by people around me that ""I am just unemployed and I do nothing"". ""Maybe if you didn't do nothing, you won't be so depressed"". To which my heart sinks.

 What is the difference if I write and create content for my own movement on the environment, then get paid grant money to do someone else's movement. Why is my movement suddenly less worthy, just because I am unemployed. As I sit there, learning how to write, use adobe programs and create movements from scratch, investing my own money for a greater good, I get told that I am doing nothing and to get a REAL job. Where I do the same thing for grant money. I however will be stripped of my freedom to spend 1/2 my day in movement. I made a decision that, I do not want to spend so much time, proving my value to people who are equal as me. Just as capable. Just another business person like me, being confused and problem solving as they go. We should be proving our value to each other.

 Sometimes I try to do something on my own. And I get told that I am stupid, incapable and I get yelled at. My dad tells me ""If you have never done anything, why are you pretending you know?"" words like ""you idiot, why haven't you done anything, you don't listen, you don't do anything. Don't try, you will break it. Not with those hands. you don't know anything. Let me do it. I spent hours helping you (when I warned him that he doesnt have to). When I make a minor mistake in life, and it's not my fault. I come home calmly being good on myself. I come home to hectic freak out about my life. calling me stupid. you did this again. it must have been you that fucked up. because you are stupid. it's your fault you are in my way. stop coming under my arms, you made me fuck up."" 

Being in this house, I feel un-empowered. when my life fucks up, it's me that fucked up. When I try to do a task, it's like something is wrong with my hands. I feel hunched and incapable. I feel like that in life sometimes too. 

I am told everyday about a ""They"". ""They"" are just trying to overthrow the government. ""They"" have brainwashed you of feminism and gay is ok. (It IS all ok) ""They"" are trying to start a revolution. ""You are stupid, wake up!! and stop living in ""their"" brainwashing"". 

I am shaking, I am scared to do things for other people. I feel watched. Micromanaged. My capable hands crumble, in front of someone. Proving me incapable to them. I can hear the voices over and over in my head. ""You don't do anything. You fucked up again. Go get a REAL job. No one cares about your art or initiatives. Not with those hands.

 The world is a negative place where ""they"" are in control."" It is covid19. All the jobs are online. I don't want to be forced to spend my time in this house. I want to be gone. I run and run and run away as far as I can. I feel relief the further I go. I feel peace. I feel like I can just be myself and fail peacefully. To get out of my house, I need to get a job during covid. To get a job I have to prove my worth to someone else. to get paid trash money. because non profits. its ridiculous. 

I used to work for someone else in the banquet industry. I felt so stupid. I felt like I was seen as stupid. treated like I am stupid. I am not though. My ego hurt me in that way. I felt like I was getting paid but not learning. I was independent however and free of the vocal abuse. 

I lay here in bed. Hoping that I will get that exciting feeling in my heart again. I wouldn't feel so alone. Be so alone and I can get out of my current state. I am taught, not to play the victim card, I am told not to make excuses. I ignore it all and keep working. How long can I hold up? Will I hold up enough to escape? Will I learn that working with people is a safe thing to do and I won't be told that I am too slow or incapable? Will my hands not crumble? 

I do a lot in my life. I can probably even be a freelancer. I tend to slow down when; I get into an argument with my family and feel useless after. I get depressed because I start believing that I will not make money and be stuck in the house longer. I try to solve that depression by listening to positive podcasts that encourage my viewpoint and go for walks, watch videos to self care. I feel incredibly alone and start searching for connection on social media. I feel cabin fever and I go outside, I need spontaneity, sometimes I go on youtube for that. I feel happy outdoors, going on road trips always helps. I actually feel so happy that I forget about depression. Until I come back home and it hits me hard, repeating the cycle once again."
201,Is this something to be concerned about? Or am I normal?...:,"Okay so I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety before and have taken medication/ antidepressants for it. I think I’ve been doing better if I’m being honest. But there’s something I don’t understand. Sometimes I just self sabotage because I’m bored, I realized I obsess over a lot of things and try to always keep myself fixated on Atleast one person. Like my ex .. I am still healing from the break up and the toxic damaging relationship, and sometimes I’ll be making great progress but in the back of my head my brain is trying to push the narrative tht I miss him and tht I need to keep obsessing so I can keep my mind occupied and distracted. I’ve been trying to change it from my ex being the one I’m fixated on to another past lover I’ve had. Besides tht I have this like voice in my head constantly telling me no one likes me and everyone has their own secret plan of how they’re lying to me and trying to keep me from being a better me. Like they all talk shit behind my back. It’s so bad it feels like I’m literally losing my mind bc my mind is restless and I feel so paranoid bc I rlly believe in my head and heart there is no one to trust. Like yes my abandonment issues and internal insecurities could be 2 huge things fueling it. But I feel crazy !!! I noticed it’s esp heightened a week before I get my period. This is just the surface of my mental issues. Idk I just feel like there has to be an explanation , something ab myself tht I’m not seeing. The last few years have been so challenging, a lot of things have happened to me so it makes sense tht I’m so exhausted and like “damaged” and paranoid after so much traumatic shit but ?? Idk"
202,I finally cut of my narcissistic controlling ex. I’m still so scared of being alone.,"So i’ve(23F) been feeling more confident recently, ready to be free from a controlling and nasty relationship that lasted 5 years and then 9 months of on and off togetherness. 

I cut him off today when i just couldn’t hack it anymore. I felt a pang of relief, but since i’ve just felt scared and alone. I fear the wounds from where he has brainwashed me to believe horrible things about myself will never heal. I’ll never be good enough. Why is it my brain would rather me go through hell and be with someone than be free and without."
203,Is it normal to lose interest in things I love doing?,"I dont feel depressed or anything, but my motivation to do my favorite things is almost nonexistent now. Any advice?"
204,How to stop feeling depressed about the state of the US?,"Hello! I’m a 22 year old in the general Boston area, and I went to my first protest last night. I’m very glad I went, but I saw a lot of very awful, traumatic things I wish I had never seen. It definitely opened my eyes more, but it made me so fueled with emotion. Anger, rage, sadness, sympathy, etc. peaceful protestors were wrongfully injured. I won’t go on about the details as it’s obvious.

I woke up today feeling somewhat okay. I was saddened, but I had felt such a sense of solidarity at the protest that it made it worthwhile. I felt like I was making a real change.

I log onto Facebook, and let me tell you, it’s been an ugly day. I was met with a timeline filled with 50/50 posts. Half of my timeline was BLM and half was all lives matter. I DO NOT want to make this post political. I do not want any comments regarding politics and I don’t want to imply anything. My question is simply this:

I’m someone who struggles with general anxiety and bipolar type 2. I’m still figuring out meds as my diagnosis is relatively new so my emotions aren’t completely regulated yet. What are some ways that I can help relieve this awful feeling? The news, the radio, Facebook, streets, it’s all hatred. It’s so ugly and brutal and I know it’s necessary for change but it’s HARD, for real! I am strong in the sense that I’m here to stay and support, but I often times feel like I could cry at the drop of a hat and I feel this anxious shakiness in my chest all day. I’m trying to not be addicted to the news and my social media, but with everyone trying to argue with everyone else it ends up creeping up on me with anything I share. No matter which side you are on, the fact is it’s sad we have to pick sides. How do I cope with feeling so lost and overwhelmed by this sadness? What are some good distractions and conversarion  topics, so that all of my convos with friends and family don’t have to be about this every second of the day? I am very vocal and do have discussions when it’s needed but how can I take my brain away from this anxious state of affairs were in? 

I need ideas!

Thanks! And I hope everybody is staying safe."
205,It hurts to be alive but I’m scared of dying,"This is the only place I feel like I can speak, because no one knows who I am. I feel so alone, I have a broken family &amp; my house is a state. My mum is extremely ill &amp; has been using drugs as far as I can remember. My dad is disabled, can barely walk. It’s just me &amp; my dad, he relies on me a lot &amp; vice versa. I have been putting on a fake smile for so long &amp; everyday, when no one else is around &amp; im all alone I just cry, or sit here emotionless. I’ve failed so many things in life because of this &amp; I really want to aspire &amp; do great things but the bottom line is, I can’t. I have so many dreams that I want to purse but I feel like this is all stopping me. I don’t know what to do, I just want to be normal. I’ve not been diagnosed with mental health issues but I’m pretty certain there’s something wrong. My mood changes a lot, one minute I’m hyper &amp; excited, then feeling down &amp; sad, then I’m angry &amp; restless. It’s all like I’m in a state of confusion, CONSTANTLY. I don’t really know what else to say, I just need someone to speak to because I don’t know how long I can stay here for. 

Thanks for reading :("
206,I really need some help and advice...,"This is a throwaway and I really dont knoe if this is the right sub to use, but here it goes.

‌I feel lost and I don't know what to do. Im 14 and turning 15 in a month. Every friend group I've been on has slowly kicked me out.

(Now were in a very good place financially) When I started going out with friends in the 6th and 7th grade she was so happy for me. And when I was kicked out of that friendgroup she was asking me what happened and why I wasnt going out, same happened in the middle of 8th grade and now Its happening again. She is very exited aboute me starting to go out again after the quarantine and I really dont wanna disappoint her... I really dont know what to do, Im in a really bad place mentally, Ive been bawling my eyes out for the last 30 minutes. Summer is coming and highschool is starting and I dont know what to do.

208,"Severe, Treatment Resistant Depression Treatments","Hello, I am 23, live in Minnesota, and have severe, treatment resistant depression. I also have ADD that has stopped responding to medication for several years now, and anxiety that occasionally responds to medication. I am curious about treatments for depression that are not talk therapy or medications. 

To start, I have heard about Ketamine and various electric therapies. I think medical marijuana is a treatment for treatment resistant depression too, but I am not so sure about that. If anyone has heard of any alternative treatments for depression, please tell me. If you have done something like ketamine or electric therapies, how did you get started? My doctors continuously have not been able to help me find this information, so I am hoping for a tip that can help direct me in the right path. Even what kind of doctor to talk to is helpful. 

Also, I have had at least 28 medications fail me, and as a matter of fact the person who was prescribing my medications flat out said today that they can’t help me anymore because they don’t know what to do because there are no more medications that they feel comfortable prescribing me, so that is why I am researching these alternative treatments. And that is why I really don’t want to hear about any medications. Plus, I am not interested in any talk therapies at the moment. I did several different kinds of therapy for years with several different people, and I never felt that therapy helped me despite my best efforts. As a matter of fact, I have actually been booted from therapies in the past for being too depressed. I didn’t even know they could do that the first time it happened, so I was really surprised. Most therapies that the average person my age could do are ones I can not do so easily not because I am unwilling, but because of the fact that I appear so depressed that providers feel that I need a higher level of care than what they can provide, and then they refer me to other places as they are legally obligated to do. However, the problem with that is that I have already done all the most intensive therapy options in my area that are available to me. So right now, the situation is that I am being pushed back and forth through a system that has failed me, and it is really hard for me to figure out what to do next because nobody else seems to know. I worked so hard to make therapy work, it is such a shame. I am laughing as I type this because it is so unbelievable that this is happening. Who would think this would happen. I just can’t help but laugh. So please don’t tell me to see a therapist. I already tried my hardest and it made me worse than when I started. I really need a break. Maybe therapy will help me after I get electroconvulsive therapy or something.

I greatly appreciate any response I may receive!"

210,Decreased sex drive after entering relationship? Tell me you’ve felt it too.,"I’m sure there are others who’ve experienced this...I used to be pretty reckless with sex. I used it as a tool to gain attention, and a way to connect with someone when I didn’t know how to/was afraid to by feeling and talking about my emotions. I felt power from it but was almost like a slave to my sexual desires rather than my mental and emotional needs. It just “seemed” safer that way. 

Enter my boyfriend. Our relationship has never been solely about sex. I would say we had a really healthy balance of it all, before my mental health got in the way. I went off an SSRI and stopped going to therapy. I experienced tons of anxiety and depression, and needless to say, that killed my sex drive. On top of that I felt like I was being insanely triggered by childhood trauma I never processed (I still don’t understand it but that’s the only way I can explain it) during my everyday life. I became pretty nonfunctional for a bit. Sometimes I would muster up the energy for sex, but it would almost be painful for even his hand to touch my leg/shoulder/any non-sexual area. This improved as I started to feel more stable again, but I’m now back in that territory. 

I feel a lot of guilt for this, because it has nothing to do with what I feel for my boyfriend. On the contrary, I’ve never felt MORE at ease and in love. He totally fulfills me emotionally, and for some sick reason that makes me uninterested in sex. It sucks. 

I just restarted therapy and we’ve already talked about attachment issues and social anxiety and all that good stuff. It’s all starting to make sense to me, but if you can relate to this in anyway, I’d love to hear from you. :)"
211,Why 25 push ups for 25 days to raise mental health awareness challenge New Zealand?,"There's a trend in NZ for mental health awareness where you do 25 push ups for 25 days, you have to challanege others to do it too. I don't agree with it:

Can't we do 25 days of showing weakness instead of re-enforcing the stereotypical ""A man is strong""? I'd rather be involved in a trend of people allowing themselves to be seen when they're VULNERABLE, so those in mental hardship can see that it's OK, and feel more comfortable showing it themselves- Not get discouraged or feel pressured yet again to live up to the toxic pressures of ""what a man is"". There's so many other ways to show strength than the physical. And yes I'm aware of the 2 dimensional 'for a good cause' raising awareness trope for the 25days challenge- but really think about what we're doing before we become part of it.

Part of a  conversation with a close friend;
""When were watching people do push ups were subconsciously looking for weaknesses"" whether in their technique, how far from the ground they push &amp; thinking a little less of those who did it on their knees- this is not supporting those with mental illness its serving the old ways. Why can't there be men/people crying instead of doing push-ups? And why the #challenge? If someone gets tagged in a challenge and they don't do it,- does that mean they are weak or simply don't care? No it doesn't. And when a woman does it but a man doesn't, are they less of a man now? No they're not. 

A man has hardships
A man has sensitivities
A man cries 

And that's more than OK, its NORMAL. Instead of hiding all our flaws and vulnerabilities (which I have been doing myself if I'm being honest), let's celebrate ""weaknesses"" in hopes that someone in Mental hardship will feel more comfertable expressing it to someone else."
212,"I have nowhere to go, I'm still waiting for the right place to fall in and rest","I've never felt like I belong somewhat as the place which I can say makes me feel like home, makes me.feel understood, that doesn't make me feel I'm the odd one in the group. 

I know a lot of people feel this when I say that I'm tired of feeling this way. I feel like I bother everyone with my existence, my friends, my parents, everyone else. The ""friends"" I mention don't even talk to me but they will always be my friends you know. I miss them. I miss my school when they would be around me all the time and I would have fun. 

Feels like I was only happy when I was small and ever since I've grown up, everything has f*cked for me. I have zillion responsibilities on my shoulders, million things to think about, my mind is in a constant maze game and I'm struggling hard to get out but I never do. 

Whenever I laugh and smile I am more concerned about going back to my old life after the laugh ends instead of enjoying the moment. I cry a lot, it hurts my chest and my shoulders. 

I have no one to talk about this with, my mother is nice and she's depressed herself, struggles with life and I do not want to put this on her, even if I do talk a lot of things she won't understand. My dad is an ass and doesn't live with us here. 

Everything is just messed up, I feel like a burden on everyone's head. I feel like I should be somewhere else, some other spot, some other place. I do not belong here."
213,"I have utterly no reason to live, I'm on the verge of killing myself, I seriously need everyone's help and opinions","So, as a kid I've never been abused physically or mentally, atleast in a traditional sense, growing up my parents used to fight a lot and unlike normal parents they'd tell me and my siblings everything, often exaggerated and filled with ahte for the other. My siblings weren't affected as much since they're both 3 and 4 years older than me.
Over time I became an antisocial and resended, growing up I had to experience a lot of things by myself from my perents fighting to strong hallucinations probably caused by schizophrenia ( I'm still kind of confused because I'm pretty sure I am depressed as well, which isn't possible is it? refferring here to the fact that schizophrenia and depression are hormonally opposite)
Anyways, I went through a few psychoses one of them lasted for 1½ years, the whole psycoses was about this extremely real dream I had, it was a part lucid dream nearly like  W.I.L.D, the time in that dream was equal to the time in real life, in that life I grew up, a little rebellious and a little mentally frustrated, fell in love with a woman because she somewhere in once conversation said to me ' I accept you as you are, no I actually love you for who you are' I know it's kinda cliché but it moved me back then, I was only 12 after all. So, we live on have a happy life, no kids, happy life when she's about 65, she dies of a natural cause, I try to live on by walking right into the sea and as I suffocate to breathe, I wake up.
I know this was simply a dream and nothing supernatural and I assume I knew that back then too but everything I felt was more real than it still is in this world, over and over night after night I have cried because I have forgotten her name and a lot of things from the dream but the sensations I felt, they still remain, it genuinely hurts, hurts so much that I've attempted suicides over it, it is as if someone very very close to you died except that they never existed at all, for anyone else atleast, almost every other day I warm tears rolling down my cheeks at random occasion, often in those where I'm smiling, for a few years I cried and cried over it but unil a couple years ago I had never attempted suicide, mostly because atleast I remembered them, this all happened between the ages of 11 -13
Then eventually I found books and his myself in them running away from the (relatively very small) abuse and the problem of dealing with my emotions, I read some 300-400 books in the next 3 or so years, probably as a defence my mind had forgotten most of the traumatic experiences that never physically experienced.
But slowly things started getting worse, I was forced to put the books and everything away in my 10th grade, it's an important year, the exams in this year were important for jobs and stuff (or atleast that's the shit we were told). The condition started to worsen here but I passed through, the next year went fine too, I was basically still running away from my mental issues constantly using masturbation to supply me dopamine highs( I mean like when it got serious I masturbated to even 18-20 times a day,I also made sure my zinc supply in the food was high.)
But in 12, last year (I was 17) I couldn't handle it anymore, almost every day I have cried, i have slit my wrists so many times it resembles burn scars more than it resembles cuts.
I tried to hang myself quite a few times last year, since then I have and because of the dream death has become as ordinary for me as going to sleep, I have stood up on ledges of my apartment to make sure it wasn't just me exaggerating facts and Just so, I felt no fear, at that time I used to stop myself through the arguments of guilt about how my life is not mine it's of the people that I love.. yada yada.
But nowadays my memories don't feel like mine, I can't remember half my childhood, over time the arguments have lost their effects and I am on a course of certain self destruction, as of no I draw (almost all day) to run away from things but I'm 100% sure that the next time I feel stressed or perhaps any of those feelings return I will kill myself, even if I don't I will probably give into some delusions and beliefs and go insane.
I deny to believe in god, he probably doesn't exist but just in case he does and I meet him I'm gonna kick that motherfucker in the balls and to his death,
Strong sentiments I know 🤦🏻‍♂️ but seriously even if he does exist, there is absolutely no chance of me having any kind of faith in him.
P.S.   I'm talking about all this now because shits going south again, its... Let's just say.. all the cameras on my devices are covered in tape and I keep looking for cameras in my house even though partly as a game.
     Also, I know all this is probably extremely unbelievable or atleast seems highly exaggerated but trust though I can't promise you it's all true, everything I'm telling you is exactly as is from my memory of these events.

Btw I needed your opinions on what I should actually do with my life, and why is it worth seeing a whole life through again."
214,I think my friends are abandoning me.,"First of all, i am girl from brasil, and i have 13 years old, and sorry if i sayd something wrong, im not too good at english.  
   
About 2 years ago, i was diagnosed with panic syndrome and depression, so i have to take medicine every day. (im not the only one who suffers from depression im my family, my sister, dad, grandmother  and my uncle suffers too.), im not going to school too (almost 2 years of not going).

Recently i was able to get better, and i was planning going to school again, but yesterday something happend, that i can't get of my mind,  i think my online friends are abandoning me, theyre are my key to be happy everyday (i dont have anyone to talk in real life, so i just talk to my bestfriends online).

One of them blocked me from discord (i know him for 3 years), and refuse to talk to me (because i did a joke with one of my bestfriends,i was just joking about the computer of one of my friends who died,and he thinks that what i said was really asshole, this friend of mine who had the pc dead, he has depressed too, and his pc is everything to him, i think i was really an asshole, but my friend who blocked me, he was an asshole too, he always blocked me from discord, because he knows that i dont like when people ignore me, and I always cried and begged him to unblock me.), he is the onwer of the server where everyones talks, and he banned me too (today he unbaned me), but he doens't let me talk to the others (he put me in a role where i can just see the messages, but i cant talk), all of my friends just talk  to him, and i dont have any way of talking to them right now (By the way, hes not a kid, he is 18 years old).  


Because of that, im really anxious right now, thinking that they will abandon me, i dont know what to do, i dont have anything to be happy everyday except my friends, and i dont have the courage to have new friends."
215,Is Suicide selfish?,I just rather not be here but how can I justify fucking up other people’s life for the sake of my own?
216,"In industrialized democracies, are police always the ones intervening when someone in a mental health crisis is deemed to be at risk of harming themselves or others?","In Ontario, Canada the Mental Health Act permits police officers to apprehend individuals if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is acting in a disorderly manner and is a threat or at risk of causing harm to themselves or others. Sometimes, there are crisis teams where the police are accompanied by a nurse or a social worker, but this is not typically the case. 
Sometimes, police are called to help a person in crisis and instead of getting help, they end up being killed by the police. Are there other models that don't involve the police in other countries?"
217,I want to die but won't do it,"It's been on and off for four years and every once in awhile I get really depressed and just get lost in my own thoughts. I am constantly thinking about my suicide and how I'm going to do it and every once in awhile I hit my head with objects or bang it against my desk. I have a girlfriend who gets heartbroken every time I get like it. My thoughts manipulate the truth and makeup lies and it hurts our relationship sometimes which makes me feel worse most the time. I'm only 16 and grew up with a constant fighting family with my best friend passing away shortly after my parents divorced. Ever since those events, it's just been smaller things that get to me a lot quicker than they used to. The only reason I'm still here is because of her she's my lock. But my reason for posting is my question. What is it and what do I do? Is it really bad?"
218,Empathy + Anxiety = Too Much,"As an empath with generalised anxiety, I feel really hopeless. My empath traits heighten my anxiety and I don’t know how to help it.

I feel overwhelmed and drained after I see people. I feel like I could cry (even if I had a nice time) and I need to just sleep or sit by myself in a dark room afterwards. It’s like I lose sense of myself when I see/text/call anyone. I feel everything they say, think, or do so intensely. Why am I like this and how can I stop it?

I especially feel like I need to recharge after I visit/call/text my Mum. Our relationship’s really good (it was what my ex-counsellor called “emotionally abuse” for a while a couple of years ago, but the bad things have stopped since I moved out.) I love my Mum, but I feel so overwhelmed whenever I have contact with her - I feel like I lose myself because I’m scared things will go bad between us again.

To help my anxiety surrounding Mum. I have a rigid schedule: I text her twice a day and see her twice a week. But even that doesn’t seem to help my terrible feeling of dread and I just feel trapped. It also doesn’t help my empath overwhelmed feeling as I feel like I carry Mum and all her problems/opinions everywhere with me.

I spend hours and hours trying to think of a solution or new routine to try with Mum to stop the dread, worry, and drained feelings but I end up in tears with no solutions every time. Can anyone help advise me what I should do to stay close to Mum, but not feel fractured and overwhelmed?"

The movement of Black Lives Matter is about conveying a message. POC want their voices to be heard. DLC wants their voices to be heard. 

DLC was going to interview Lisa B today about yoga and anxiety but she asked if we could postpone the chat(TBD) She is also a journalist &amp; video producer who seeks to tell stories that matter. She came to me with an idea of using the DLC platform to tell YOUR stories.

We are reaching out to POC to submit a video of yourself answering either: what do you want people to really know, how are you feeling, how can we move forward? We ask to please keep it short (under 15 seconds) so we can include many voices. 

We hope to educate &amp; inform others in a non violent way with a video montage. Remember: This is your voice. Your voices will be heard. Speak out for what matters.

220,Sudden energy and mood changes,"I have been having moments where I'm pumped up for the day with plans of accomplishing much, when all of a sudden my energy goes from 100 to 0. I crawl into bed and just lie there. I'm on antidepressants and valium for sleep. What could be the cause?"
221,Im tired of trying to act like im happy but from the inside im not...,"I just feel so numb and i want to feel something. Anger, fear, pain, anything idc i just want to feel some kind of emotion again..."
222,I’ve been feeling really down.. I just wanted to vent..,"Have you ever felt such sadness that you can feel the knot forming in your throat? Have you ever felt strong emotions overtake your mind a body to the point that everything is rushing through your mind like a wild stampede of antelope running down a mountain? Understanding mental health is sometimes confusing. 

I have been dealing with mental health issues for a long time. I am just now realizing how much of a battle this is.

At my current age of 24, I have tried to voice my concerns with my mom. Ideally, your mom would be the one you talk to when issues arise in your life. You're supposed to feel safe and comfortable talking to your mom or any other adult that close to you. 

What if, you talk to that important person and they don't listen? Better yet, what if that person doesn't care to acknowledge what is being told to them? 

In my life, I have lived through many traumas. Some of those traumas she knows about and there are some she has no clue about. She once told me to watch a documentary about a child that was abused and killed by his mother and her boyfriend. She told me to watch that show so ""I would know the signs of someone being abused"". 

I was infuriated. I said ""what about the times I was Raped. What about the times, that family friend made me feel uncomfortable by the way he would hug and kiss me, what about the times I told you I felt alone and needed an adult to talk to and guide me, what about the time my aunt's then-boyfriend grabbed my by my waist and pulled me in so tight I couldn't get away. What about the fear you made me have towards my father? Always threatening me not to tell him those type of things because he would get mad and punish me. What about how you sheltered me most of my life that I didn't know how to socialize? I have felt so dumb my whole life. What about the fact that when I was in 6-8 grade there were multiple boys in that school that would grab me in inappropriate areas. What about the fact that you would call me a slut/ whore for years. How you told my boyfriend to run away from me. How you made me believe I was not good enough, you made me feel like what I had to say didn't matter.""


I have lived the majority of my life feeling alone, unimportant and useless. 


It's very difficult trying to help yourself when you don't have the support of the ones that you wish you did. 


The only support I have is from my boyfriend, my father (who I have started to build a relationship with), and my little sister. 

It is so difficult to talk to my mother ( the person I wish I had the support of) but what good is it that she will not even apologize for anything. 


Please find a person you can talk to. Please talk to someone"
223,I don't feel anything,"I'm new here. I don't know if this is the right place for this.

I'm female, 25 years old. 

I don't feel things like normal people, I think. 

I think I don't feel. I want to feel. I think I used to, many years ago. 

TV shows make me feel nothing, video games make me feel nothing. Meeting new people makes me feel nothing. Sex makes me feel nothing. Graduating made me feel nothing. Drugs make me feel nothing. Hurting myself makes me feel nothing. Hurting others makes me feel nothing. People dying makes me feel nothing. People being happy makes me feel nothing. 
No matter what I do, there's nothing. No one helps, nothing helps. I don't care about anything or anyone. I want to care. I want to know what it feels like to want. 

I am so tired. I want to feel. I used to be okay with this. Pretending all the time to make people around me comfortable. I didn't mind. I'm tired. I want to be normal. I want to be happy about good things and sad about bad things. I want to feel joy and rage and sadness and empathy. I am so tired of pretending. I don't know what's wrong with me and I'm tired of not knowing. I want to know.

Does this happen to anybody else? When I google it only antisocial disorder comes up, but I don't have those symptoms. What is this?"
224,hi its me back w another post,hi little redditers ive come to seek some sort of advice (or not really bc im not sure what im looking for myself) but like idk for the longest while ive been so?? idk how to describe it? like im sure its not the lack of sleep bc i do get a good amount of sleep now that its the summer but its been really hard for me to concentrate or do much of anything and its like even when i do try to get work done my mind spaces out alot and it feels really fuzzy and like mega difficultly concentrating. i used to be a top A student in all of my classes and like lmao rip to whatever happened bc like i can barely have the energy to entertain a decent social life or really do anything even on a daily basis. im sure its not depression or anything but i really do want to become more productive and in tune with myself but i dont really know how to bc i literally lack so much energy and excitement to do much of anything. idk if its because ive always been on the smaller side and underweight but like ive been better in the past year or so i just really dont know what to do tbh-
225,I hate it here,"I’m tired of living in the United States, and life in general. There’s people protesting for basic fucking human rights and our government is responding with armed soldiers and more police brutality. Just thinking about it makes me sick.

226,"I want very badly to have a relationship with my cousin, but I'd have to work super hard to keep enormous family secrets from him if I did. It's hurting my mental health, and my heart."," **TLDR: My cousin's dad is a sociopath (has literally tried to kill his older brothers before), and the fact that everyone but him in the family knows is tearing me apart, and stopping me from having a relationship with him like we did when we were kids. I don't know what to do about it.**

So I was raised around my three male cousins. The three of them were siblings, but I may as well have been the fourth. Literally 80% of my interests that I have today as an adult are because of them - they'd be over every single weekend, and they never bullied me, always included me on EVERYTHING despite being a girl (the oldest, who's 5 years older than me, would even say, ""If you two aren't letting [u/CaliBounded](https://www.reddit.com/u/CaliBounded/) play, we're turning the video games off."" I loved them dearly, and we were around eachother ALL the time until Hurricane Katrina hit. We're all from New Orleans, and had to move across the country from eachother in different states after the storm. I'd see the older two once or twice a year in the earlier years (they have a different mom than the youngest one - let's call them A, B, and C), but eventually, we'd see eachother every two years.

Even still, I saw C every SINGLE year, multiple times a year, because he lived in New Orleans where my grandparents were (who we'd visit somewhat often). C and I may as well have been twins, we were so inseparable. We told eachother about our boy and girl issues (people we liked), complained about our parents, shared our goals and supported eachother. I could tell him literally anything. But there's some huge secrets surrounding C that just about all of our family knows about that C doesn't.

**A, B and C's dad is a homocidal, greedy, cheating, lying sociopath.** And I'm not exaggerating in the slightest. A and B, as I mentioned previously, are from the same mother. He not only regularly cheated on her, but abused her emotionally and physically. A, B and C's dad does this to all of the women he dates, punching and pushing his previous wife before A and B's mom out of car going about 6 miles an hour while she was pregnant with his first child (A, B and C are the second, third, and fourth children). One of A's earliest memories is doing his best to wake his mom up because A and B's dad lit their house on fire while A and B (who were toddlers at the time) and their mother were inside. A and B's mother was wealthy, and he wanted all of her money. While A and B's mom was in the hospital from this incident, he took her credit cards and ran her 50k into debt, and crashed her convertible (which he used to pick up women in - another one of A's earliest set of memories is being in the houses of women that his father was cheating on his mother with). While A and B's mom was recovering in the hospital, he visits her and tells her that he's been cheating on her, is about to marry the new woman, and that she is pregnant with his child. She does not call the cops on him for this because he'd been convincing her for years that he knew people on the police force and that they'd never believe her - he did not.

C is born as a result of this union, and my mother and C's siblings love him to death (C is a year older than me, so this happens before I'm even born). Skip forward a few years to our childhood - because my own parent is a narcissist (A, B and C's dad and my mother are certainly siblings... she made an attempt on my life at 17 and I haven't spoken to her since) and likes to gossip, she lets me in on all this stuff by the age of like, 7 years old. My relationship with C begins to get a little harder to maintain, because as the years go by, I'm being informed of more and more terrible things that their dad did, and C has no idea. I have had so many slip-ups because I forget what parts of the story or facts about his own life that he does or does not know about. ""It doesn't help that C is kind of a know-it-all, and used to say ignorant shit like, ""Sometimes I think A and B are mad because my dad divorced their mom and married my mom."" and he has no clue what actually happened, or how he came to be. Into our teen years, my grandmother got dimentia. My mother did a lot of work to put her in one of the best homes in our state that would make sure that she was taken care of. My uncle (A and B's dad) took her out on the pretense that he ""wanted what was best for her"", when really, he wanted to steal my grandmother's money. Thankfully, my mother and grandfather, before putting my grandmother in a home, changed her bank codes so that he couldn't do that, and that's how they found out - the bank reported suspicious activity with my grandmother and my uncle at one of their locations, suspecting elder abuse.

A terrible legal battle follows where my uncle tries to get Power of Attorney (legal gurdianship over my grandmother, who is deemed incompetent). My mom fights and fights for it, but loses because of my uncle's proximity to her (he lived in New Orleans and we did not). Even though it was my mother and I who cleaned out her entire house, that upon visiting, had dog hair all over the walls, canned food two years past the expiration date, etc. It was traumatizing being 14 and doing all of this for a woman who used to be so strong and took care of me growing up. Having her forget my name. I remember it all. Which is what made me stop speaking to C - C knows that my mother is abusive. But because he knows nothing about his father, he thinks that he's better than my mother. One day, I was telling him about some abusive things that she was doing, and he goes, ""Well, you have to understand, this is the sort of thing your mom does, you know? You probably don't know that she was trying to steal grandma's money? My dad had to get into a legal battle with her over it!"" I was literally there when the bank sent us an alert. I was literally there, in person, for a lot of terrible things my uncle has done. I was there cleaning out her home, helping prepare to get her moved into a place where she would be taken care of. He is so out of touch with how terrible his father is that I couldn't talk to him anymore.

The worst part is that because he's a know-it-all, you can't just change the subject off of our parents - he'll keep on insisting we talk about it, and ask why we're changing the subject about my ""Terrible mother"". I'm not defending my mother in any way - she *is* terrible. But after living in a home with her where she was awful to me and lying to everyone about it, I am dead-set on living a life without lies, family secrets, etc. (A is the only relative I still speak to in my family after the incident with my mother). My mother is awful, but she would have NEEEEEVER abused my grandmother. Taking care of your elderly parents is INCREDIBLY important in New-Orleanean culture. I was THERE at the court battle (was asked to testify) for her power of attorney and literally watched my uncle lie on events that I was physically there for. I'm less offended that he's insulting my mother and more offended that he actually thinks his demon of a father is a good person. I've tried just telling him, ""That's not true. I can't tell you why, and I can tell you one day, but not now."", or simply, ""I don't want to talk about this, I'll talk about it one day"", and he either gets angry because he's heard this from everyone in his life already, or he thinks I'm being condescending. Even his own grandmother knows (my mother and grandmother tried to warn everyone they could about my uncle, and that C's mom shouldn't marry him, but he'd gotten into hear head and told her that we're ""just jealous"" - C's grandma told C's mom not to marry him too, and didn't listen).

I just stopped talking to him one day. I still love my cousin. I miss having my best friend. I miss having someone that was so supportive. I just had to cut him off because I couldn't go on having him not know. I'm going to talk to my therapist about this soon (a lot of other stuff has been going on, so I haven't had the ability to speak to him) but it hurts my heart that I can't have a relationship with him anymore because I can't handle keeping a secret for people. I asked A when we were ever going to tell him (this is HIS father, not mine, and I don't feel like it's my place to do so, and I'd rather have his blessing before saying anything), and he tentatively said, ""When he graduates college, I guess...?"" I'm 23 now, and C is 24, but he's in the middle of a degree that will probably take around 7 years (we imagine this is so he doesn't let his parents in on the fact that he knows/have this explode his perception of life as he knows it while he's pursuing his studies). He's got a good two more years to go before he's done, and I don't want to wait that long. I already used to think about him from time to time, but Coronavirus has really made me reach out to people that I haven't contacted much and keep them closer.

What can I even do about all of this?"
227,Is this depression?,"Hello! I’ve been a long time lurker on this subreddit and I think I have fallen into the depression hole. So I lost a lot of interest in school, my social life, time with my family, and exercising which I used to love doing but now it feels like a chore... even brushing my teeth or playing video games feel like a chore now. I really have no goal in life anymore and no motivation to do important things such as school. I recently started having fantasies of my own death and how no one would cry for me... But the real shit was that 2 days ago I started to cut myself on my arms becouse I was tired of being in emotional pain and would feel something physical to keep me distracted. I am looking for a therapist or something to get a diagnosis but where I live, we are still in hardcore lockdown so any advice on how to deal with my situation?"
228,"Without all this stuff going on in my head, I would be a terrible person","The extreme levels of pain I've been through have also brought to surface my narcissistic tendencies, my toxic attitude towards women, my unberable jealousy, and other things that if had gone unnoticed, I would be an awful human being. I already have done bad things in my life, luckily enough I stopped myself, but had to face a nearly unbearable side of me."
229,What's it called when you realign your perspective because you found out events happened in a different order than you originally thought?,"Over the past 7 years I've smoked more pot than I should have.  A lot of events were fuzzy, sometimes happening half a year apart from when I originally thought.  Lately I've been going back through emails and such, and I'll often find out that things happened in a different order than I thought,and I experience this feeling in my mind where my world perspective changes, like having to reorder books on a shelf.  


Is there a term for this?"
230,"I have started eating significantly less to protest God’s influence over my life. I believe in the judeo Christian God, however I am a misotheist. I will try to explain my reasoning but it probably won’t make sense.","I have a few health problems in my life, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, surgery to fix pectus excavatum and surgery to remove one testicle for testicular cancer. I’m 28 years old now and have had severe chronic fatigue syndrome at least since I started highschool at age 15. I believe God has unjustly inflicted me with chronic fatigue. I believe, despite that I am physically attractive it is extremely difficult for me to find a woman to be in a relationship with. I am not shallow. I have been in a dating relationship with 2 women (at different times) and both ended within a couple of months. I have been talking to a woman who seems very interested and expressed wanting to see me, but every time something has come up and she has had to cancel the date. First it was a shift she needed to take at work, then her grandma had trouble breathing (and I feel really bad for her), and now her family doesn’t want her to go out because of protests and curfew. I HONESTLY believe GOD IS FUCKING DOING THIS AND I WANT HIM TO FUCKING STOP!!! GOD WILL NOT WIN!!! HE CAN NOT SEPARATE US!!! I KNOW GOD IS TRYING TO KEEP ME FROM HAVING SEX AND I SPIT IN HIS FUCKING FACE!!!!!! And so... I will significantly reduce how much I eat in protest of God’s tyranny."
231,I’m not skinny for the first time in my life and I don’t know how to deal with it.,"I’ve been skinny my entire life, and always teetered on the edge of being underweight. Part of the reason why I managed to stay so thin was because I have an eating disorder and I would closely monitor my weight and restrict whenever I put on a few pounds. However, taking birth control and antidepressants have caused me to gain around 30 lbs in total, and even though I’m still a healthy weight, I don’t feel like myself. I went from being around 132-138 on average to 160 (I’m also 5’8).

I go back and forth multiple times a day being in love with my new curvy figure and absolutely loathing it. There are parts that I adore, and don’t want to lose the weight because of the risk of losing them. I went from being hardly an A cup to a B, and having absolutely no ass to having a big ass for the first time ever. Looking back at old pictures of myself from when I was thin makes me want to crawl in a hole because I’m so much bigger now. I’m not sure if I should try to lose the weight I gained or try to make peace with it. I’m aware that many people would probably envy my figure even how it is now, and some people pay a lot of money to look the way I do. Nobody has a problem with the way my body looks except for me, and I don’t know how to get over it. Being skinny was a much bigger part of my identity than I realized, and I don’t recognize myself anymore. But I’m not so sure that losing all the weight would make me any happier because I was never content with my figure to begin with."
232,just venting,"I don't know where to start because I feel pathetic just writing this on here right now, but I've been dealing with so much self hate and depressive episodes these years, my emotions are sometimes a rollercoaster, some weeks I don't feel nothing, someday I just cry and then an hour later I'm hyper and later I think I would be better off dead.
I hate the pressure I put myself into, I hate not being able to communicate to my parents, my bf or my friends about anything that happens through my mind, I hate feeling like a burden and I hate to see how fast I'm deteriorating when I used to think I had a lot to offer to the world.
At this point I literally don't see any point in life, I'm too scared to harm myself physically so I just keep hating on myself for every little thing.
I've tried seeking help two years ago but it actually made things worse, my parents act like the doctor never told them I had depression and they get angry at me for always being sad and not motivated, even though I try so hard to not disappoint them, some days I just can't.

233,I feel like a bum,"With this whole COVID-19 going on my mental health has been declining , I wake up everyday feeling sad and feeling like a failure.

I don't know if I should go back to school and just improve on my math and english skills or if I should pick a career and go into that field. I feel like this world is falling apart and my mental health on top of that isn't helping me at all. I guess you could say that I'm feeling really stuck and depressed. I don't know anything and I don't know what to do."
234,My mom made me kill my grandma??,"TW DEATH/ABUSE

Sorry for the length. Basically I've(21f) been thinking about this nonstop since it happened and want to get it out. Not sure where or if this is a good place. 

In February we got a phone call that my grandma was put in hospital and was on life support. My mom told me this and I arranged for both of us and my sister to fly out to be with my grandparents because things sounded bad but we didnt know the extent yet. I managed to buy the next flight( to another country), booked a hotel and convinced my boss and school I needed a week off with the potential of more depending on how things went. I did this even though my sister and mother have had an  abusive history towards me. It's mainly emotionally but sometimes become physical as well. My mom in particular has used parentification throughout my life but I ignored all of this for my grandmothers sake. 

I felt in that moment it was more important to see my grandma and it wasn't my place to stop them from seeing her as well. Honestly I'm not even sure how I managed to be around them that much in the moment but looking back I was probably in fixer mode as I'm used to being in my family. I'm not too sure as my memory of the time is fuzzy.
We arrived at the hospital straight from the airport and at that point I hadn't slept in at least 48hrs. We were informed that my grandmother was in a coma and her body was shutting down. Within a couple hours a specialist was called down to meet with us to tell us the outlook which was not good. She said that my grandmother had brain damage and her body stopped producing heat which caused all of her limbs to die. And the chances of her waking was slim but if she did she would need all of them amputated and had the potential to be blind. On top of this was the potential for any unknown side effects of the brain damage. It was devastating to hear and so unexpected as she was fine 2 days before.

The specialist asked my (step)grandpa and mother if they wanted to continue with aggressive treatment or remove the machine intervention and wait and see how things went. My grandpa who has early stage alzheimers told my mother that it was ultimately her decision what to do. 

My mother shut down. When asked what she wanted by my grandpa then again by the doctors she only would reply, ""no thank you."" Repeatedly she would not give an answer and my sister was manic and not apart of the conversation. It was frustrating but not surprising. It followed my moms pattern of behavior to not take responsibility of anything. She stared at me while the doctors got frustrated with her lack of response and had already told me privately she thought my grandma was already dead and gone. Things were getting more and more tense. 

And so I stepped in and told the doctors that the best thing would be to make my grandma as comfortable as possible and take the chance without the machines. And so I gave the final consent to unplug my grandma. I told the doctors to stop interfering and allow her to die. 
She only lasted a couple of minutes on her own.
So her death is on my hands. I can't stop thinking this. It's been constantly on my mind. I mean I didnt have to step in but I feel I did not have a choice. I feel she forced me to make this decision and to take on this responsibility so she didnt have to. It might sound weird but I feel like I'm too young to have the responsibility when there were older adults involved. 

And now she has asked me to be the one to organize the funeral and to speak to my grandmas lawyer on my moms behalf about the will. Because of Corona this was all pushed back until now and my mom is pressuring me to do this for her. I've told her no and explained it was not my place to do that for her but she keeps asking and pressing me. She disagrees with my grandpa over the final arrangements and wants me to step in and fight him about it on her behalf. But I cant and wont. 

I have PTSD following the death of my father 3 yrs ago. Which was made worse by the death of my (other) grandma last yr. And now I feel that these events with my mom and grandma has triggered a relapse and it's getting worse. At the time initially after I was devoid of emotion but as time has progressed I've had more and more intrusive thoughts of guilt. My mom doesn't believe I have PTSD or in the existence of mental illness in general. So it would mean nothing to her if I told her shes made mine worse. Another small part of me thinks that I've the situation a bigger deal than it is in my mind and she didnt really do anything wrong and it's normal for parents to ask their kid for help. Am I wrong to think in some way it's not right? And to be angry at her for asking so much of me? 

Anyway if this is read by anyone thank you. I really just needed to rant about it. And sorry if there is any mistakes as its difficult to get out."
235,Need to vent and tell someone,"Throwaway account because I don’t know who she does or doesn’t want to know. 

Earlier today I took my partner to the ER because she was having suicidal thoughts. We have both been struggling emotionally with everything going on but the last few days have been exceedingly tough on her. She has been working from home and rarely sees another face except for mine. Walks in the park and zoom calls with friends only go so far. I convinced her to call the hospital for advice and they requested I bring her in.

In my scramble to get everything together (insurance, etc) and make sure we got out the door it never even crossed my mind I would not be able to stay with her. The staff was gracious enough to allow me into the waiting room to sit with her while she checked in. But with everything going on I was not allowed further than that and had to physically leave the hospital.

I’ve never dealt with this before and I guess I should have known better, but they informed me they would have to take her belongings. This means I have no way of contacting her short of calling the hospital and requesting it. They said they’d keep me updated but it has been almost 2 hours and I haven’t heard anything.

I know we did the right thing but I still feel guilty, scared, and alone. I can only imagine how she feels.

Thank you for reading. I needed to tell someone/anyone."
236,I need help.,"I feel useless, I have so many negative thoughts going through my head. I grew up not having anyone to talk to..

239,I Keep Earnestly Trying &amp; Failing to Find Community,"I moved to another city across the country about 2-3 years ago and pretty instantly in that move lost interest from most of the people I considered my friends in my old city (one of them even blocked me because he revealed he had a crush on me that now he couldn't do anything about, even though he's still currently with his boyfriend that I introduced him to). At the new city, the few connections I had sort of stopped responding to communications over time and were always too busy (it's LA). I've joined local groups and organizations but haven't made any strong or lasting friendships (and quarantine hasn't made that easier) and even on Reddit I've tried to post in support groups for specific communities I'm in (ADHD and Non-binary) and my posts asking for advice or sharing personal triumphs were actually downvoted repeatedly. I also left my career of 10+ years during the move and have felt aimless since then, stumbling to figure out what I'm doing moving forward.

I feel like I'm scrambling to put together a large, priceless vase I've accidentally shattered into pieces—but it's my life. 

I've genuinely run out of places and people to turn to because even when I find the places I think I can, I get more rejection. All of the self help I read says to rely on support networks and friends, but I feel like I can't connect with people or something. Like there's something wrong with me that I don't realize makes people not care enough about me to keep me in their lives. Some flaw I can't see. I'm 32 and I feel like if I died my funeral would have less people in it than a Burger King and I would have made no impact large or small on the world. I can't even find a hobby or anything to just take my mind off of it (also, ADHD). 

I guess I just needed to vent to basically the last place that seemed like it wouldn't turn me away. I hope you all are doing OK and staying as safe as you can during everything going on inside and outside our homes. Thank you for your time and, hopefully, your understanding."

241,How to deal with a bully that is my coworker?,"I have a co worker that constantly swings into bullying and then being cool the next day with me. They talk shit about other people(including me), says things to my face as well and just generally has this fuck it attitude. 

She can not show up to work but if other people do it she talks about how you are lazy or asks why you did(none of her business really but still talks shit constantly), and then literally the next day will try to be cool and funny with you. I know i shouldn’t let her get to me, but work has not been great for me considering all of the coronavirus stuff as well some managers being shitty. 

I left work hours ago yet it is still on my mind. Just need some advice on how to deal with this kind of person. I read into people but i can’t figure out what the hell her problem is. Our job is team based and she acts like I don’t do shit in the mornings after dealing with some personal things last week and eventually showing back up to work and giving my full potential. Like i said she did the same shit as I did, didn’t show up yet somehow continues to bully and berate you for it."

243,My home situation is pushing me to the edge. Sometimes I feel like it's better to have no father at all.,"\*I'm sorry this is so long. I'm also new to reddit so this might not even be noticed ever.

I'm a teenage girl (still a minor in HS), firstborn, with a10 y/o sister. My relationship with my father has always been strained. This is probably the main reason I struggle with mental health. I'm going to try to explain this as well as I can, but even I am confused with my own life.

My parents never loved each other. They're not divorced, but they are together for the sake of their children. When I was younger, they fought ALL the time. It was horrible, getting physical a lot. I have never seen them kiss or show any affection. At the peak of the domestic issues, they would both trash talk each other to me, the eldest child but I was only a little girl. Now I'm a teenager and they don't fight anymore, they just get along neutrally. But the trauma from trying to protect my baby sister as a little girl and having to see the domestic problems still haunts me.

A little background info is that he absolutely ADORES and BLATANTLY FAVORS my younger sister. Praises her even though she's 10 and hasn't done shit. Calls her the ""best child"" in front of me every single day for the past i-dont-know how many years. When my mom or me casually calls out his bias, he doesn't even deny it, almost admits it or just smiles sheepishly and goes back to praise my sister. I have never shown that his rejection of me hurts, I always hide it. But it hurts so bad. To know I am unloved. I am by no means a bad child. I work hard, I have a 3.9 GPA, I participate in extracurriculars, never get in trouble at school, yet all I hear is how I am lazy and stuff like that. While my younger sister sits on the couch all day (that's not an exaggeration) watching TV, she gets told by my dad that he's sure she will get into Harvard because she's so smart and the perfect child. Not to mention she talks back ALL THE TIME and he just laughs it off. I talk back, and well, you can see what happens below.

Moving onto my own situation. This started when I was a pre-teen, I guess. It's hard to explain and I think I have tried to block out a lot of it. It's a periodic thing- I would maybe show too much teen angst or attitude, and then my dad would get furious, say something like ""don't talk to me"" and he would ignore me for months at a time, maybe one time it lasted almost a year. Then we would be forced to start talking again because of a family vacation or something. And then a period of time where we were ""normal again."" About a year ago were at the dinner table and he was asking me how sports were going. He was being really repetitive and asking questions I had already answered or had no way of knowing, so I showed a little annoyance in my tone, like ""I don't know, how am I supposed to know that?"" He blew up, telling me how he pays for everything and stuff. We didn't talk after that for almost a year. Now I am writing this because just yesterday, he blew up again and now I don't know when the next time we will talk is. It was at dinner again and my sister had insulted me FIRST, and so I fired back \*jokingly\* like, ""better than you at least"" and my dad gets mad at ME. Tells me I have no humor, yet if I ever insulted/roasted my sister like she did, I would get called a BULLY. So then the conversation moves on and he asks me something, and I jokingly say back ""none of your business"" and he gets so damn mad. I say ""well it's because I have no humor, like you said."" And he says how if I ever talk like that I'm getting kicked out of the house. (not the first time). I didn't realize how mad he was, because the next day at lunch he screams at me and points his finger in my face, ""STOP TEXTING ME. DON'T TALK TO ME. DON'T EVER ASK ME FOR ANYTHING AGAIN. YOU ARE NOT MY DAUGHTER."" so now I have been crying all day and I don't know when life will be ""normal"" again. But I shouldn't be so sad this has happened before and I should be used to it.  
\*It's important to note during these relapse- ignoring periods, he doesn't like ""neglect"" me physically, I still get stuff paid for and what not. Also I am his biological child although sometimes I wish I wasn't. I often daydream about what it would be like to have another father.

The worst part of these ""ignoring"" periods of time is during these periods, he will try even harder to show my sister love, like he knows it hurts me. He'll talk about how awesome she is to her, how much she's the best kid, while I'm downstairs getting a glass or water or something.

I love my sister. But I think this favoritism and blatant hatred of me by my father will damage our relationship. I think we will probably be estranged when we're older because I have been damaged by this. I'm jealous of what she gets. Even now, I find myself getting slightly mad at her, because she's so favorited and I know it's wrong because she's only like 10 years old. I started wondering about how I was going to get married without a father years ago, which makes me really sad. I'm still young yet I already know I probably won't have my father walk me down the aisle and I think about who would replace him a lot...

I have thought about what makes my father hate me, because as far as I can tell I have done nothing to warrant such rejection and dismissal. Firstly, I am more introverted, I don't express love or feelings that openly and I'm quieter than my sister. My sister is a huge kiss-up, she knows exactly what strings to pull and what lovey-kissy things to say to my parents/father. Also, my father is a second child as well. He is estranged from his older brother, I think they fought and haven't talked for like 20-30 years, so maybe because he hates his older sibling, he projects this hate onto his own eldest child. Also, I look more like my mom, and they had some tough times, as you can see from above.

There's more specifics and stuff that's too much to type in this, so I'll leave them out. But this is an overall of what pains me. I hate these ignoring periods, and I don't know when it will end. I only have around 2 years until I leave for college, and it's during times like these I cannot wait to leave. The worst part of being a minor and dealing with it is I have to live under the same roof, which is why I can't wait to leave home. I've done extensive research on passive fathers, narcissistic fathers, emotionally unavailable fathers, etc. but I have never come across anything remotely similar to my situation, thus why I have turned to reddit. I'm not necessarily suicidal, I don't think I would ever, but I do think about death everyday. There's a little part of me that thinks...that knows my father wouldn't care much if I died."
244,I don’t want to be around my mother,"She keeps blowing up on me and then a week later she will apologize and do it all over again. She’s starting to get a little violent. I had my friend over and cleaned up but it wasn’t good enough for her. When I went over to see what she was trying to show me and she started yelling and kicked something several feet away. So I screamed at her that she was acting like my father. He always started throwing stuff and kicking things right before he blew up and started to get very violent. She of course came back with the brilliant come back of “no you are acting like your father,” to try to hurt my feelings. It really didn’t but I must admit that I do not want to be around her. I’m not going to let her go off the hook from this. It’s just hard when I’m the only other person who lives here."
245,I’m scared to ask my PCP about seeing a psychiatrist,"I’m in a bad place mentally, my emotions have been very intense and unstable for the past couple of years and I’ve finally admitted to myself that I need professional help. Im ready to rake my first step finally, but I’m really nervous to talk to my PCP about this. I don’t really know what I should say either. Should I just tell him about my mood and my troubles and ask for a referral to see a psychiatrist? I really have no idea how to do this, if anybody can help me I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much for any help."

247,Tricks to stay focus and help against procrastination?,"A lot of the time I find it extremely hard to focus on anything for more than minutes.
Can’t do one thing at the time. Even watching a movie. I’d use my phone, draw or do something else.
But sometimes I get this weird motivation all of a sudden and I get my work done. I don’t know if Im just able to work normally when im under pressure (for ex when im working on something due for the next day) or if I have an attention disorder or else.

But either way what are your tricks to stay focus? If you have difficulties to concentrate what do you do?

(I tried listening to music while working and it makes it worse cause I focus on it more than the actual work, also tried fidget toys already)

249,Need advice on starting the process for mental help for my girlfriend.,"Hi if this is the wrong place to message this I apologize in advance, and before I begin I'm not very well versed in mental health.  


My girlfriend was on antidepressants since 2017. Approximately six months ago my  girlfriend's prescription for Citalopram ended, before that time her father lost his job and thus their health insurance. She has not been taking anti-depressants for the  past six months and I've tried to be supportive in encouraging her to begin the process of getting a prescription again but I've admittedly not been serious enough about it as she's been seriously struggling. It's gotten to the point where she is no longer able to sleep at all at night and regularly stays up until the morning before taking naps intermittently throughout the day, while I think that's probably due to some insomnia, it's certainly not helping her. She works very hard to not show it when we're out with friends and her family, so I think they're under the impression she's managed to overcome it, but she's seriously struggling.  


I'm wondering what steps I can point to her and help her through in order to get her help. We live in Houston TX, USA if that's needed.  


Any help would be greatly appreciated."
250,"i cant handle this any longer, what is this","i cant do this anymore. everything people do, everything around me fills me with rage. chewing, breathing, footsteps, tapping, people talking, loud music,  and tons of other small things around me give me full out panic attacks, and fill me with rage. I can live like this anymore I dont know what its called but I cant handle it anymore, I cant even be around my family without lashing out anymore because all of their noises and i know thats stupid but i mentally cant handle this, and everything physcially makes me feel like im suffocating

idk what this is but i need help"
251,I feel like I steal my personality from others/I have no personality,"I don't really think I've got a personality, which is strange to explain but I feel like an empty shell of a person.
I just steal my personality from others, I adapt how I talk and react with different people. I steal characteristics from them and then act/speak/text like them.
I feel like I change my personality every week, that all I do is steal personalities from others then use it to fit in.
I'm not sure what type of personality I have, people say 'be yourself', 'we'll love you for how you are', ect.
But I have no personality? I feel like I mold myself from others, that I'm an empty hollow person that can capture other people's personalities. I feel so numb, how do I know my real self when all I feel is numbness or sadness? 

I don't know who I am anymore, am I a mix of multiple people? Does that make me useless? Am I some sort of emotionless person that uses other people's personalities to fit in and get what I want?

I feel like I'm different from other people, I'm just a copycat, a nobody. I copy people's personalities? Why? To fit in? To not be judged?

What the fuck is wrong with me, why can't I be normal?"
252,How to stop catastrophizing?,"Early 20s male. I think I have a lot to be proud of and be grateful for in my life, but my mental health issues have been a silent stain throughout my life the past 5 years. They started appearing shortly after I got to college. I had a great girlfriend that meant the world to me, but we never had sex even after several years because I was too afraid of the worst case scenario (her getting pregnant) even when using protection. 

This trend continued. I sent emails with typos to professors and wondered if they would think I was stupid or fail me. This still happens at work now. One minor slip up could have me getting a pink slip the next day. When someone unmatches with me on a dating app, I worry that I said something wrong or offensive and I might be labeled what I’m not. It’s worse because I can’t go back to reread that conversation, even though deep down I know I would never write such things. Uncertainty and OCD compounded have almost driven me to suicide.

Catastrophizing is agonizingly painful to a degree I can’t even describe. Does anyone have any tips? It’s hard to enjoy life anymore when your brain is looking for the next catastrophic end to your life/happiness/reputation/career."
253,so i have no friends,"i need help with getting people to like me.

I've been bullied my entire life so I don't have a problem with name-calling. there are 3 main people, 2 don't mind me but the other despises me. so to sum up please help with her not heating me ( I'm a boy and there all girls)"
254,Long term intrusive thoughts are destroying me,
255,Which branch of psychology would be most suitable for me?,"First of all, I apologise for any mistakes. English is not my first language.

I've been diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder, OCD with psychotic symptoms, and posibly Borderline Personality Disorder.

I have tried cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD and psychoanalysis and Jungian psychology for my bipolar disorder.

Now I want to focus on a problem related to BPD, which is that I want to have sex every man in a position of power over me (real or symbolic). Sometimes following a sadomasochistic pattern where I try to dominate them, and when I manage to do it I get bored and leave them. Other times they try to dominate me and I resist them only so that when they force me to submit that superiority is reaffirmed and I generate a dependence.

I've already dated and had sex with one of my university professors and kissed my previous psychiatrist several times. All of those relationships have ended pretty badly.

Sometimes I have dreams involving my dad which make me feel very guilty.

I know that I have much more serious problems than that but I've had a boyfriend for almost three years (Hello, I'm the boyfriend helping with translation) and I don't want to continue being like this. I'm constantly fighting those impulses and no therapy has ever helped me. Now I'm trying to take responsibility for my problems and I'm very disgusted with myself.

What I'm trying to find here by posting this is someone to tell what kind of therapy would best fit my problems and help me deal with them."
256,is it normal to want to self harm everyday?,I’ve been struggling really bad and I just have an urge to do it whenever I feel bad now. I’ve been in a funk lately and it’s the worst I’ve ever gotten and so I can only feel good if I harm. I just now started doing things again because I started harming again (I tried to quit and I stopped for awhile I didn’t do it as much but I stopped everything and nothing made me happy anymore) but now that I’m doing it again it makes me feel like I do feel better but I know I’m not. But I don’t want to give it up. And I don’t know what to do because I know that I can’t keep doing it but I don’t know what to do
257,Just about to try sleeping after 42 hours without,"If you've read the news or been on social media recently, I don't really have to explain. You're probably feeling the same as I am if you're in the US. I'm actually hoping to just fade into oblivion and just never wake up again. Is anyone else more terrified by the idea that gods and afterlives are real rather than oblivion? Is anyone else more afraid of surviving this disaster than they are of death? I just got over being maltheist not even 2 years ago. I don't want to go back to that state of mind."
258,Increasing anxiety medication dosage during Covid19 / racist bullshit???,"Hi all. I’m seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow and I’m considering asking him to increase my current anti anxiety/antidepressant dosage b/c with everything going on in the world, my anxiety has been much worse these past two weeks. I’ve also been having trouble sleeping and have been crying more lately. I’m wondering if anyone has had to increase their meds since Covid19 and etc. started? Would you recommend doing this?

Thanks!"

260,I hate myself for a very small thing,"I get distracted when doing schoolwork, a lot and end up creating a cycle that I can't get out of.

When I get distracted I get really pissed off at my self and end up saying to myself that I'm useless and I'll never achieve anything.  I then go back to procrastinating to distract myself from the fact that I hate myself, starting the cycle again. I've been doing this for about a year and It has ruined my self-esteem and I don't know what to do. I'm scared of talking to my parents because I think they'll say I'm just overreacting"
261,I feel like I've lost my mom,"My mom got mad and started saying a bunch of nasty, hateful and just awful things to me and my husband. Today I told that that she was destroying her relationship with me and she didn't even care she just gave some sarcastic response. 

I can't even process how I'm feeling right now.

For the first time in my life I feel like I don't have a mom."

I can't seem to force myself to be consistent with appointments and taking meds like I'm supposed to. I know I need to do these things to get better, but I feel like I don't have the energy or motivation. It doesn't help either that the people who said they were going to help hold me accountable for these things have totally flaked on me. How do I get over this?"
264,Does anyone else feel flat/depressed after taking antibiotics?,"Not sure if this is the right sub to post this in. If it isn’t please redirect me otherwise, mods. 

Anyhow. I recently had to take a course of antibiotics and I can’t remember feeling this flat, depressed and emotionless in a very long time. I’d this a normal side effect of taking antibiotics? How do I get out of this funk and feel better? 

It’s just crazy to me that just a few days ago I was so emotional about everything, and now can barely feel anything. Thanks in advance for any insight."
265,I need some help,"So, for some context, I live with my family (18M) broke aviation college student, in Canada. I also have Asperger’s syndrome and ADHD.  Usually I’m a go with the flow guy who is always positive and always cares about others. But ever since the pandemic started and I stopped going to school, I’ve slowly become more jaded, cold and heartless. Lacking the ability to care or pay attention to others to any degree. It’s a fight every time. Because I just can’t care, it’s not that I don’t want to. But I just can’t.  Most of the time I am still happy however.  But onto the next thing I keep experiencing mental flashes of negative impulses, everyone gets them but mine have steadily been getting more frequent and worse, murdering or assaulting all my close friends, stealing and bullying.  And it’s driving me to mental breakdown.  Because I’m terrified that I might deteriorate to the point where I’ll actually go through with it at one point."
266,Please remember to take a break from all the crap going on in the world right now,Spent the past couple days glued to a screen and now I’m an anxious wreck. It’s important to be informed but don’t let it get to you too much
267,How do I get help for my mental illness?,"I’ve been diagnosed and have struggled with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and dysthymia for about 13 years. I think I have BPD, but haven’t been diagnosed with that and haven’t seen a doctor in a long time. There have been ups and down, but none of it has ever gone away. Because of the current pandemic, I have been isolated in my apartment for about 3 months. It’s making everything worse. I think about suicide often and find myself staring into nothing for hours on end, completely dissociated. 
Needless to say, this is terrible for not only myself, but my relationship. 
I’ve tried many things to distract myself, productive things, but it’s not helping. 
I want to get help, I really do, but I have no insurance and I honestly wouldn’t know where to start or who to go to. 
If you have any advice, I would very much appreciate it. 

If this information helps: I’m 23, female, and live in the US."
268,can somebody help me out? i'm not sure if i should be concerned,"hello! i'm 15 (turning 16 in a couple days) and recently ive been thinking a lot.  

are the following things i should be concerned about? (\* i am NOT looking for a diagnosis.) 

\-constantly aware of breathing and my heartbeat, which then turns into me being worried that something is wrong with me / just scared that i can't breathe properly, which makes it worse. it's getting bad now just by typing this out.   
\-intrusive? thoughts: they're things that disgust me and i would NEVER ever do things like that. i used to be an asshole when i was like 12-13, so i've been trying really really hard to become a better person ever since. so thoughts of me doing awful things or thinking really gross thoughts is horrible. i know i would never do them but they're always floating in my mind. to try and ignore them i play really loud music in my headphones or trying to focus on a different feeling (e.g the feeling of my thumbs rubbing at my hands, or pinching my foot and focusing on that pain. sometimes i just imagine these thoughts as a panel of concrete which i smash to bits in my head and focus on each fragment.) 

\-getting extremely irritated whenever somebody raises their voice, shouts, loud noises like clapping etc. chewing is also extremely bad- it's the only thing i can hear at the dinner table although i am able to ignore it by thinking of made up scenarios in my head. 

\-i am revolted by terrible personal hygiene. my younger brother came back from boarding school in england and it is awful at keeping our bathroom clean (think shit streaks in the toilet, water all over the counters, piss behind the toilet seat. i'm sorry it's disgusting.) 

\-ive also always had a habit of picking at the skin at the edge of my thumb, mostly starting out as boredom at first but as it heals, it usually doesn't become smooth again or whatever so i pick it until it's smooth. i draw blood all the time by accident and ignore the pain. (now that i'm thinking about it. why Do i do that?)

\-i cannot handle being in a quiet place by myself. i always feel like something or someone is staring/watching me. i get really scared and distract myself by watching a video. if i'm at school for example, walking back from the bathroom to the classroom, i'll quicken my place but my heart will beat like crazy until i see another person upon which i think ""it's okay, they don't see anything, so nobody is there.) 

\-a more minor thing which i thought everybody did but i guess not: ever since the age of 8, every time i hit my head i would go through a cycle of basic information about myself to ensure that i didnt have memory loss. in the order ""my name is \_\_\_, i'm \_\_ years old, i live in \_\_\_\_, im \_\_\_ and \_\_\_, i just \_\_\_\_\_."" 

if you read all of that thank you so much. any help or input is greatly appreciated. again i am not looking for a diagnosis, i just want to know if these are things i should bring up with my counselor / be concerned about."
269,Recent paranoia,I have for the first time started seriously being concerned about my mental health. About a year ago I found out that my grandfather died due to suicide and basically every man on my mother’s side of the family since at least the late 19th century and had depression or PTSD of some sort.  Before this I was always just sad but I assumed it was me hitting puberty.  But recently I have had an extreme sense of paranoia and impending doom and have lost interest in even some of my favourite topics and activities and just don’t feel joy.  I can’t go to a therapist for obvious reasons and I don’t want to talk to friends and concern them.  If you guys have any recommendations it would be extremely helpful if you shared them.  Thanks
270,I KNOW WHAT I KNOW AND IM TIRED OF BEING LABELED IF IVE NEVER GOTTEN DIAGNOSED,"i have discovered things i could never have thought to be real, things other kids seen on tv’s in shows or movies with special abilities they’re never talked down on frown upon. they’re known as powers, and no i mean real spells, rituals, chants, your form of praying just cultured to their beliefs. i don’t claim to have MPD tho if you hear a voice in your head technically you have what is claimed to be Multiple Personality disorder. some things that should never have a label because no brain scan, or doctor, no one really knows if a person is actually crazy, we’re given that because we tend to have certain characteristics but i’m trying to shorten the best way i can and i’ll do it but i know things, beyond what most know but i know people have to have felt yourself have just so much power because you work in ways only certain people know. i’d claim myself psycho/sociopathic, skitzo, i try to tell my partner but this man is epstein level manipulation and involved in sexual things but it’s i found him doing porn yatta yatta, i just need someone to listen and speak back to me and not down me because he’s the reason why i started connecting back to myself and i just need someone"

273,"i cant get work done, its pushing me farther and farther into my own depression","im in 10th grade right now, and ever since 8th grade ive found it really hard to force myself to do work. its not that im not motivated to do it, i feel lots of stress over it and i understand the implications of getting bad grades and how it can fuck up my future. my parents are very strict when it comes to grades. ever since school went to pass/fail ive been way less motivated. my gpa is like \~3.4, which my parents are very unhappy with and they have been constantly punishing me by taking away my electronics and stuff. they constantly lecture me about how im going to be a fuck up, and how they aren't gonna let me live in their house after high school, how i should just drop out of high school if im gonna put in so little effort, etc. its like they think i dont know. i hate myself so much for my lack of willpower to do work. i hate myself every day because of how lazy and useless i always am. i know im a disappointment and i have known ever since i started bringing home subpar grades. i think my laziness is the reason i have ""depression"". im on prozac but i dont think its done much. i feel so trapped, at times the only way it seems is to end my life, to quit existing. i dont know what to do, i feel so stuck and i feel so unable to change, and i dont wanna make excuses for being lazy. i have tried going in with the mindset that i WILL get my work done, or i wont quit until i work for 2 hours straight, and shit like that. it never works. sometimes i get bursts of motivation but its very rare and usually because of extreme stress. i dont know whats wrong with me, but i seriously need help. i have no idea how to change"
274,I want to get help,"I made an alt acc to post this so nobody searches me up and finds this. If you want to discuss or reach out, please dm me. 

Here we go.

I have the strong belief that I have a few mental disorders. Right now i’m having an “episode” of sorts. 

I’ll describe how I feel AT LEAST once every two months:

Suicidal: random, monthly, and more severe during my period. Small events can trigger this, or nothing at all. I’ve thought about my whole funeral proceedings once :).

Depressed: also with the suicidal tendencies. Maybe its just a phase (i am 14), but i’ve had these feelings since i was around 8 yrs old? 

Self-harmy(?): i apologize if i offend anyone with that word. But this also ties in with suicidal &amp; depressed. I have an x-acto knife thats tucked away. I usually self-harm to see blood or to “punish myself” for being a horrible person. 

Anxiety: I think its genetic? I believe my mother &amp; grandmother have it. I’d rather not go into detail with their issues. But anyways, sometimes I get little tics if I think too hard about an embarrassing  moment? I also feel like people are out to get me sometimes, that my world has fallen apart, etc. my last major problem (anxiety attack) was october of 2019. I couldn’t solve a problem in math, teacher would help, so i sat there unable to move and cried. I couldn’t talk, i felt hopeless. It took me about 10 min before i could snap out of it. 

Depersonalization??: i just looked this up about 10 min ago while browsing this subreddit. So sometimes I feel like I’m not there for a second. I forget where I am, what I’m doing, who I am sometimes. This occurs very frequently (especially during school) and is uncontrollable. 

 numbness and coldness: This is very frequent, nothing much else to say.

Note: my doctor actually gave me a survey &amp; said I tested high for anxiety &amp; offered to refer me to a psychiatrist. I refused (stoopid). 

I’m posting this here because my family (minus one cool member who lets me vent) is in denial of my issues that affect my everyday life. I don’t know if we can afford it. They are super religious so I’m told to “just pray it away”. My mother would laugh at me if I asked to be diagnosed. I’m scared to go on anti-depressants because I heard they make you worse. Can someone please just give an idea as to what’s wrong with me? I’m pushing weekly to go see someone (in the future due to covid). My relationships are slowly breaking (in my mind rn). 

I’m writing this during one of my “episodes” of depression/ suicidal thoughts. I’m still here. My mind is overrun with voices telling me to cut &amp; die. I’m pushing through this to get heard. Please help me."
275,I was feeling sad and empty and I was finally able to cry,"I was feeling awful and wasn't sure why. Part of it was longing for my boyfriend, who I haven't seen since early March, and part of it was anxiety because we're in a rough patch right now. And then I thought of my beloved cat who passed a few years ago and finally the waterworks started. It feels like a relief to cry but now I can't stop and I can't sleep.

I feel lost"
276,Any idea what this is,"Hi so sometimes when I get anxious I start to feel tight in my chest and like my mind is disconnecting from my body (like there’s an inch of space between my brain and my skull) and I’m not sure what it is. Usually when this happens I try to block out all the light I can, and find a corner to sit in while listening to music until I get better, but if there’s a name for it I’d love to know. I don’t think it’s depersonalisation / derealisation because I know I’m me and everything is real. I also don’t think it’s dissociation because I don’t feel out of my body or anything and I’m in full control of myself, I just feel slightly separate. 

Idk if any of that makes sense but any help is appreciated."
277,Advice for a 15F,"My parents make me feel “trapped”

Just to get things settled, I’m almost a 16F who was diagnosed with GA.

In my opinion, my parents treat me unfairly. I am the oldest in a family of 5, as I have two younger brothers. My parents will take away my phone, that I pay for with money from my own job for keeping a cup in my room. Additionally, I was grounded for a week when I suggested to my brother that he used a frozen banana instead of a regular banana in his smoothie.
The list goes on, and when I voice my concerns, they laugh and find it amusing. 

However, they find it a necessity to medicate me and send me to therapy, which makes me feel so uncomfortable. For example, they have me on a medicine for my anxiety, which they think makes my behavior “better” even though it’s only to deal with anxiety. But, regardless this medicine has made me throw up and made me feel shakey. I am scared for my physical health on this medication. On a meeting with my psychiatrist via telecommunications, my mother waited at the door and immediately called her after our call was complete.

I took a brief hiatus from therapy because I was enrolled with a very expensive mental health program. Now that things are opening up, they are forcing me to go to therapy. Although, it has been a toxic and twisted experience that has led to many many restless nights. Although therapy can be helpful to some, I know that at this point in life it is not the right choice for me at this point. Although I have tried a honest approach, my trust has been violated which can lead to me to unintentionally “lie” to my therapist, which is not beneficial to me, my parents or the therapist.

Any advice? Do I legally have to go to therapy when it ends up taking a toll on my mental health...?

Thanks :)"
278,I need help idk if it’s really bad OCD or what,"I keep focusing on random things and their placements. Here’s an example, I’ll be watching TV and for some reason I’ll pay attention to how I set the remote down and then for a long time I’ll keep focusing on the position of the remote wondering what I can do to get my mind off the remote, like moving it so it’s even or in a certain position. And it completely takes the focus off what I’m watching. Another example is like I’ll be playing a video game and my mind keeps focusing on how a water bottle across the room is placed and I should place it differently. I also thought for 20 minutes straight whether it feels right to put my wallet on my desk or in my dresser. These thoughts happen every single day and it’s really affecting my focus and happiness. I’m 15 and I feel like it’s trapping me."
279,How to help self-isolating cousin?,"3.5 months ago my cousin (25 y/o man) stopped responding to communications with anyone outside of his immediate family. He had mentioned to them that he was going through a rough patch and just needed time to figure things out. I am close with him and we used to talk on the phone about 2x a week, so I was startled by this. Fast forward to now and he has not talked to his parents or sister for 3 weeks. He lives 3 hours away from us and his family has gone to visit him twice but he's refused to see them. I tried to visit him last weekend but also couldn't get him to engage after waiting outside his house for a whole day. We know he is alive because his neighbors have seen him.

I am very worried about him because he lives by himself, doesn't have any friends in his city, and is clearly in a dark state of mind. I am worried that he will hurt himself and have no one around to talk him out of it. I do not understand his behavior, and I also don't know who to talk to for advice on how we can help him through whatever struggles he is facing.

Is anyone familiar with this kind of self-isolating behavior and have advice on what to do?

Thank you for your help."

Not soon after that I watched a video that had a gay guy and not soon after that I started having intrusive thoughts on whether I was gay or not, I haven't tried to combat the idea but thinking about it always gives me anxiety (I searched it up and apparently it's normal, it's apparently a OCD/Adhd thing).

282,"For a second, I thought about taking bag of pills. Is that suicidal ideation? (23M)","\*I just searched for a sub-reddit related to mental health. I don't know if this the best fit for this sub-reddit\*

I don't formally keep track of my thoughts and mental health, but I do notice trends. Since the third-ish week of COVID, I noticed my thoughts taking a more depressing tone. I've been thinking a lot about my sexuality and my acceptance to it, past events that I am still angry with, and decisions that I wished I made differently. I find myself being angry and sad about the same things every day. Traditionally, I would have work/school that would keep my pre-occupied, and I think I used that as a coping strategy. Currently, I do not have any of those things because of COVID and my academic semester being done. Giving recent events in the States, I find more things for me to be sad and anxious about. 

Today, I looked at a bag of pills and thought about just taking all of them because I am tired of living. I am not saying I want to die. I am saying that I am just tired of being in this world. Immediately following that thought, I thought, ""Dude! What the fuck are you saying,"" and I went to take a shower. Although it was a quick thought, it was concerning. Does that count as suicidal ideation? Should I be concerned with myself? Any strategies?"

I’ve tried many coping methods to try to get me through the day, but I just quickly lose hope and motivation and just stop and do nothing good all day."
284,Is it wrong for me to focus on myself?,"What’s going on in the world around us is horrible. I plan on doing what I can to help out (donating, petitions, etc.)
But I’ve got this thought process that if I’m not dedicating my body and soul to the cause every waking moment of my life, I’m part of the problem. 
Is this true? Am I still allowed to take part in my hobbies and focus on what makes me happy?
I realize this sounds overly dramatic, but it’s what my brain has led me to think, and I’m actually in a really bad place because of it."
285,"I want to talk to people to get help, but I’ve been made to feel like a burden and don’t know what to do about it now.","I’m depressed and have anxiety, and sometimes when I am anxious or about to cut I try to reach out to a friend to get  settled down. But now i feel like I’ve become a burden to them by relying on them, and I’m left with really no one to help me. I have other friends and people that I want to talk to, but I’m worried now that texting them will lead to a path that happened with my one friend. I’m worried that me texting people that I’m anxious or just need someone to talk to will make me a burden. How do I talk to people without being this burden? How do I not be a friend that just becomes a weight in others lives?"

288,[Question] Grew up with an alcoholic mom who emotionally neglected me.,"Hi, I was just wondering what types of resources I can look to solve my ""issues"" caused by growing up with a parent of an alcoholic. I am now a college student. What types of therapy, books, meditations, and other things that I can try to learn and fix the negative ways in which my mom has impacted my life. These ways consist of:

1. Lack of love (not becoming too dependent, insecure, or worrisome in a relationship)
2. Depressive episodes of stress, sadness, anger, etc. when thinking of traumatic experiences or seeing mom drunk again.

289,Tonight was the breaking point,"Slight trigger warning I guess.
Little bit of a rant but I just need to get this off my mind. Obviously, everybody knows whats going on and to each their own about the issue, this post isnt to discuss it. But, my town got hit with riots today and I dont know what to do anymore. I havnt talked to any of my friends in weeks and my mental health looks like Sega's profit margin over the years. Ive actually been doing well lately but everything got the better of me again. I really dont want to fallback on old habits or create any knew, but they all just seem so inviting. I try and be as nice as I can to people, especially recently since I want to improve myself but it just seems like im talking into a void (ironic) and that no matter what I do, things wont get better. I dont know what to do, im scared, im sad, and I dont know who to go to. I wish I wasnt the person who I am, I wish I didnt like the things I like and enjoy, I wish I wasnt tall, I hate my country, I hate my parents, I hate my life and as much as I keep telling myself I wont end it, I want to die.

290,Tips on Loving Your Own Mind,"Hey all, Ki here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I have come to realize that I don't love my mind. I for a while thought something must be wrong with me, because I got the whole love your body thing but I still felt not confident and so frikin down a lot of days. And I think it's because I strongly dislike my own mind. I dislike how one bad thing happens and I spiral downwards in bad thoughts about myself and self-esteem. I feel dumb, frankly, compared to other people when it comes to academics or numbers. Not just a dumb moment, but I get so down about feeling like I can't perform mentally like the majority of the population. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be loved for my mind and personality and then my ability to be cute or not. But I haven't felt loved in a relationship, and I have felt like they only wanted my body and just had a bonus of a good personality because I built one off of not being confident in myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if you've delt with something similar, and have gone to therapy, what were the tools they taught you? How do you keep yourself from spiraling down about every negative thing in your life after one little negative thing happened? An example of my thinking is like this: Today at work I was counting back out my till at the end of the shift. I was $15 short (meaning I had somehow lost $15 while working). I feel so stupid because this isn't the first time I have been short before! And what makes me feel worse is that I have been trying so hard to not be off; I count back money slowly and make sure of it. Yet when this happens I feel dumb and inadequate and like i'm stupid for not being able to deal with money. I don't want to be seen as dumb. Then I got home and as I was cleaning my glasses I broke the nose part. And so the thoughts continue and I think about everything I could be doing better at right now and everything that's terrible and I just end up depressed and crying. So at least I know it's my mind I need to learn to love, but I don't know how.

If you read all that, I thank you sincerely. 

TLDR: What are your tips for learning to love your own mind and how you function and think about the world?"
291,Quarantine,"I've been felling better since May because of quarantine, I had 2 weeks when I felt really bad, I couldn't get out of bed. I don't know why, but I have found myself really missing when I was really depressed. Feeling good is really odd for me, so I just want to get back to being depressed again. I miss the comfort of it."
292,Instagram and Apple news,"Yesterday at midnight I made a decision to uninstall both of these apps. Due to the fact that with everything going on most of the news I acquired came from those 2 apps. Instagram had taken a toll on me due to constantly comparing myself to other girls.

In summary, I am very proud of myself for having the courage to get rid of these apps that had been bothering me for quite a long time now."
293,My friends ignore my issues,"My(17f) friends ignore my mental health problems

Throwaway bc people know my account, sorry about any typos/bad grammar

I’ve spent my entire life not being able to make friends easily. In elementary school nobody wanted to talk to me, and every single friendship i’ve ever had had been initiated by me (I always am the first to say hello, and to begin building the friendship. There has not been one instance of it being the other way around) in highschool (i just graduated) i was very friendly, i always offered people help with homework (would give people answers if they didnt have an assignment done, go over papers/rewrite them, do most of the work in group projects, share exam/test reviews, etc.) and i always make a point to talk to people who were sat next to me, or to just he nice in general. No matter what I did, nobody really remembered me. I had a small group of friends, but each of them had another person they liked more than me. I’ve never been anybody’s #1. 
I’ve always been overweight my entire life, and i’m not attractive, so i’ve never had a relationship or any sort of intimacy either. 
This past year i’ve had a very hard time with my mental health. I have binge eating disorder as well as depression and anxiety. I missed most of my senior year (before quarantine) and have been hospitalized twice in the past 5 months. I will try to bring it up to my friends when i’m struggling but they usually brush it off or ignore it. If they do respond, i can easily tell that they don’t want to and are just doing it out of obligation.
Nobody ever asks me how i’m feeling, or seems concerned when i say that I’m suicidal (for example, i would message my gc with my 2 friends and say that i wanted to kms, and they would just respond with “no” to every single thing i said until i shut up. i know that they probably mean well but it hurts because they don’t bother to ask why or ask how they could help. They just want me to stop bothering them)
I want to know what i can do to be more likeable and to make people want me. it seems like i have to work really hard to keep all of my friendships going whereas my friends just kind of ride along.
I don’t know why my friends don’t want me. If anybody could tell me what to do it would be really appreciated. I’ve just reached a tipping point where i don’t have a support system and i’m going downhill again fast and dont know what else to do to try and stop it

thanks"
294,I don’t know how to help my sister,"My mom is hard on my sister. She criticizes her for not being good at school and my sister feels pressured to do good in school. She was failing almost all her subjects. Since both of my parents work and I am at college, nobody is really around to help my sister. Therefore, my mom has gotten her multiple tutors but it didn’t really help.  My sister is a slow learner but she is doing better now since she’s in online school and could go on her own pace. 

During quarantine I discovered she had written a suicide note. After talking to her, she said she attempted once by attempting to swallow a bunch of pills. I told my parents about the note. In it, she talked about the pressure from our mom as well as feeling lonely. She wrote that she didn’t feel good enough and that she was dumb.  As a family, we all talked and they ended up listening and it seemed like things would start to get better and they would be more understanding. They told her as long as she’s studying and trying her best, they will be happy. Their main concern was that she’s always on her phone and distracted but my sister said that she is trying her best in school. 

Later on, my mom and sister got into another fight about something small, but it resulted in us running away for 2 days. My mom yelled at my sister for misplacing something and my sister yelled back at my mom and it turned into a big fiasco with my mom saying that my sister has a big attitude and no respect so we ran away. We went to stay at our cousins house. My parents didn’t once attempt to talk to us during this time and ignored our attempt to communicate with them. When we finally went back, they basically said our house our rules and that we need to deal with it or get out. Their main concerns is that they are stressed out and that we don’t help around the house. They didn’t seem to care at all about my sisters mental health situation or even attempt to compromise. All they cared about was themselves, saying how we should be grateful because they provide for us.

Also, they did get her a therapist after the initial suicide conversation. Unfortunately, her therapist texts my mom about their sessions and my sister found out about those text messages. The therapist texted my mom saying that my sister feels so much pressure from my mom to do better in school. My mom texted the therapist saying my sister is distracted by her iPhone and is only doing better now because I’m here at home to help her with her online assignments. And my mom asked the therapist to encourage her to study more. The therapist said she will when they get closer. 

My sister was upset when she read that.  She feels as if she can’t trust her therapist anymore and that therapy won’t work for her. She feels hopeless and probably doesn’t feel like she has any chance at feeling better now. My sister is crying every night and doesn’t want to tell my mom since my mom already has a lot going on (health and financial issues).

I’m saying all this because I’m lost now. I’m about to enter grad school and there’s no way for me to leave and provide for me and my sister. She’s still a teenager and will be stuck here for many more years. I fear that once quarantine is over and no one is home, she might attempt again if nothing changes. She is trying to push me away when I try to help and be there for her and she’s always saying she wants to be alone. I don’t know what I’m supposed to anymore."
295,It's getting harder and harder for me to believe that things will be okay again someday,"Between Coronavirus and the racial tensions that are exploding in no small part because of existential angst due to Coronavirus, I just find it nearly impossible to see  things getting fixed."
296,It won’t get better. For me at least,"I kinda wish people would stop tellimg me that things will get bette. Because it never has. I have to deal with this racism, from my teachers and  my ex friend.

ive had thoughts today. I just want this to stop, can we just stop hurting innocent people and love each othe. Pleas.  I feel like I’m gonna be another statistic at this point. I’m scared for my and my family and friends lives..."
297,"People don't have an obligation to ""get help"" or ""get better""","We didn't choose this life, and we didn't choose mental illness. For someone who is no threat to others, there's no moral responsibility to push themselves through the mental health system. Plus, there is no proof that there is help that helps *for every case*. Look up, for example, Schizophrenia simplex. That being said, I still encourage trying everything to get better.

Some psychologists think that I should ""live for myself"" to ""get better"". What am I supposed to do? Abandon my family because they're conservatives? I'm angry because they are judgemental. I don't think that's fair. I just accept that the world is fucked and life is unfair and that we can't win every fight."
298,Stressed about new job,"Started a new job today and came home crying from the stress and anxiety. I’ve never worked in an office environment before and being called out by my boss sent me spiraling with thoughts of self doubt. I know this isn’t an abnormal thing to happen, but to be called out so soon made me feel like I shouldn’t be here."
299,Just realized how bad my mental health actually is,"My depression has been awful for years and I've been aware of it, but I think I've slowly adapted to it so that my mind processes everything that's happening as normal things that everyone experiences.

I can't sleep unless I use some kind of medication, and I found out that weed actually works amazing for me. I eat a small edible and I'm out within an hour. This morning when I took an edible to finally go to sleep, I stayed slightly high for a bit before falling asleep, and my thoughts scared me.

I thought about how content I was with dying right now. There are so many things that I want to do and accomplish that I can't fucking do because of my depression. I was about to start therapy right before covid hit and it was honestly just a big blow to any hope that I had.

I feel like life isn't for me. I've struggled so fucking much and every time I pull myself up, something else knocks my legs out and I fall down again. Every. Fucking. Time.

I'm just so filled with hate and anger. I hide it well, but lately I've been slipping a little bit. Small outbursts here and there. I get them under control really quickly, but every time it happens, the dam that holds my emotions back cracks a little bit. I can feel it.

I've never learned how to properly process or talk about my emotions, either. They're all bottled inside me and they're honestly getting too much for me to handle.

I know life isn't supposed to be easy, but fuck, all of my friends are entering their final year in college and I'm so far behind them because I can't focus my mind on my classes because my mental health has just been fucking plummeting. I feel hopeless."
300,Nit picking morality and people being unaware are making me depressed,"You can skip to the last part to get the general jist: Between the virus, working retail and the protests, I am soo disheartened and isolated. Starting with retail it’s about how people treat retail workers, how that system is dominant in America and wrong. I’ve observed people not paying attention at all,they are essentially in a trance state. I get to hear the same things all the time. When I walk past someone, the snap out of their trance and run to the register, keeping me from completing much needed work, where as previously they made no indication of moving at all, but all of a sudden they Are alive. It’s bizarre. They feel that they have the right to tell a worker how to do their job, it’s extremely offensive. Imagine doing that to a lawyer or judge, what gives that person who has never worked retail and inkling they know anything about it? You’re feelings in retail are 100% considered not real, people treat you like a dog. They ask you how you are doing and if you say im tired or in sad or I’m depressed they look disapprovingly at you like you aren’t a good worker, but the truth is you work so hard you throw up, you work so hard you don’t enjoy anything by the time you get home, you work so hard you can’t think straight and have no energy left for friends, family or yourself especially during the pandemic. Had a guy ask me how I was doing, I said I’m “tired” and he said “ok, whatever” like it was a personal attack, don’t ask me how I’m doing If you don’t want to hear it. With the coronavirus it’s just a matter of appeal to authority that bothers me. It’s important that we stay safe, but the people that are out of work have legitimate concerns for their future and too often they get made fun of for expressing those concerns. This tactic is soo common in America right now and it’s really disgusting. If a black person issues a concern and a white person says “oh they just want free shit” or a white person issues a concern and a black person just says “oh it’s white tears” they are both ways of just outright dismissing someone that doesn’t see eye to eye with you and is infuriating. Hearing another persons argument costs you nothing and let’s people get past differences. Now with the protests it’s a lot of problems, the fact that people emphasize the looters to delegitimize the protests. The fact that people try to justify the looting. The ludicrous propaganda on both sides, the fact that nit picking morality seems to be dominant, this type A personality bullshit morality that is a persons personal preferences that they try to pass off as legitimate moral grounds, when it’s just their personality. It’s soo disturbing that the middle ground is being thrown away to type A personalities that want to control everyone and everything and use morality as an excuse to do so and that nobody is calling them out for nitpicking and preaching propaganda on both sides of the aisle. 

I cannot get over how people’s morality is largely derived from their social programming and another’s personality preferences, not actual right and wrong which I believe are instinctual but social programming has muted our instincts. I also cannot get over how people will not hear another’s pain if it falls outside of their nit picking morality and social programming, like their trance states won’t allow it, examples of what l I have gone through working retail and not being heard, and also what I observed through the protesters, both those criticizing them and those protesters trying to justify heinous actions. I will never be able to look at society as Just or even having the potential to be just, ever again. The only way for justice to truly happen is for people to recognize these social/mental/physical short comings that have been instilled in everyone’s moral codes and to make it a goal to acknowledge everyone’s story. Not even agree with everyone, just to listen, but it’s never going to happen. This hole is too damn deep. So I’m just gonna watch it all burnZ."
301,Just curious,I have really bad social anxiety and I’m wondering if others with general or some other form of anxiety are anxious the majority of the time? I always thought that my anxiety HAD to be triggered by something but I’m now aware that I’m anxious mostly all the time and it’s shocking when I’m not. I don’t know if this is something else or if this is just how anxiety works? Like it just never gives you a break.
302,"Is anyone else a ""chameleon""? Am I all alone?","I don't know if there is a proper term for it, but I've thought of myself as a ""chameleon"" since elementary school.

Some fun little things I do:

-Overanalyze everything others say or do to reassure myself that they accept me and that I fit in
-Feel extremely on edge at the slightest hint that someone might dislike me and adjust my actions/words accordingly
-This results in everything I say feeling ""forced"" and disconnected from what I truly think/feel
-I micromanage everything I say and do in order to ""blend in"" with whatever group I'm currently around
 -I'll go as far as to completely fabricate stories about myself that will make them like me (I don't do this as often now that I'm older, but in my school years it was really bad)
-I'll compulsively agree with the opinions of the person/group I'm currently around even if it utterly contradicts how I actually feel
-I never feel like I truly belong anywhere, even with family or close friends. I constantly feel like I'm out of place, an ""other"" who has no true kindred spirits
-I used to be very outgoing and social as a kid, but nowadays I feel better when I'm alone because I don't have to worry about putting on my other ""skins""
-Yet even when I'm alone I find myself confused about who I truly am as an individual, so I alter my behavior to fit with whatever current mental image I have of what a ""normal"" person thinks or feels
-I will appear completely put together on the outside even though on the inside my emotions might be going haywire
-I often feel like I can't understand or process my own emotions. Like they're in some foreign language that I can't translate into English
-On that same note, I'm unable to be completely honest with my therapists because of that emotional ""disconnect"", which results in me leaving the appointments feeling bad because I'm not truly ""opening up"" or properly conveying what I'm thinking or feeling

I'm really curious to know if this is something other people also struggle with, or if I'm just as alone and ""other"" as I always feel I am."
303,i’m so done,"so tired of everything going on right now. tired of online schooling, tired of drifting away from my only 2 friends, tired of having to go through the same menial shit every single fucking day. tired of all the protests and noise. i understand why people are upset and they have every right to be. i’m upset too. but burning a whole building down? it makes all the peaceful protesters look bad. i have nothing against peaceful protesting (except that there’s a worldwide pandemic but whatever i guess). and now they’re calling in police and military officers. things are just getting out of hand in my opinion..

i’m sorry if this seems like “oo i’m an edgy teen and i’m sooooo depressed give me attention” but those kinds of people piss me off more than anything and it’s the last thing i want to be called.

i’m just so angry all the time about the smallest things.

all the stupid people in the world, people who think they’re doing good but are only making things worse for themselves and everyone around them. those anti-social distancing protests before the George Floyd ones. “covid-19 is a LIE!!” “vaccines cause autism!!” “covid-19 is just the flu!” “covid-19 was manufactured by the Chinese government!!”

they’re all BRAINDEAD. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. what I DON’T understand is why the news is putting out articles titled something like “protest happens and now one of the attendees has coronavirus!!” yeah, NO SHIT there are gonna be cases, there’s hundreds and hundreds of people at those protests. can you put out something important please?

the california beaches where again, hundreds and hundreds of people are gathering. nothing good is going to come out of that. why can’t people just be patient for once and not scream “I’M OPPRESSED I’M OPPRESSED” when we’re in quarantine to save other peoples’ lives. to keep people on the front lines from going home and breaking down from all the stress they’re under. to keep our kids healthy. ffs.

sometimes i just want to end it all. to not have to worry about anything anymore. to be free from all of this anger. i just don’t know what to do."
304,What does it say about me that I still can’t finish the last episode of *Community* because I’m terrified of something ending but when my ex girlfriend of over a year broke up with me I didn’t even try to fight it?,
305,"Feeling really blue about life out of nowhere, why am I feeling this way","I think the combination of social-distancing and watching larger than life movies has made me start feeling really sad and bored about life like something is missing. The strange thing is, I was doing really well with everything up until now. It all just came out of nowhere. I've been WFH for 12 weeks now and for the first 11 weeks I've been doing really well, still happy and excited about life. But this last week I've been feeling sad, like I want to cry for no reason. I continue to have hobbies, go on walks, talk with friends online, but I can't seem to get rid of this blue feeling. I'm planning to meet up with friends on the weekend and start going out again to socialise as restrictions get lifted but I have a gut feeling that this won't take away the sad feelings I have right now. And with how shitty the world is right now I don't think going out and hanging with friends will lift my spirits as much as I hope it will. I've got a great job, great friends/family and have a bunch of hobbies but lately I feel so unsatisfied/disinterested about it all.  This is going to sound really dumb but I did watch Vanilla Sky recently and it was super depressing for me... I think it's what put me in this mood. The social-distancing has also made me now feel like there is no excitement in life anymore. How do I get rid of this feeling...i've tried getting rid of it for a whole week now and it's still not leaving. And why has it come about out of nowhere? :("
306,I was stalked.,"This past weekend my stalker went from someone I used to know to a problem. He came to the city I live in and tried to find me. I found out the next day, and I finally had to unblock him to tell him off, important to show for a restraining order. My FB 48hrs before I could re-block were up today so I downloaded my messaging apps again and had to record what he sent me during that time, and the worst was a video that made my skin crawl. I’m not handling it well, I’ve shown the video to two people who got sidetracked and didn’t really give me a voice to speak about how it made me feel. I’m scared. I’m hurt. I’m confused. Got in contact with his family and I’m not getting the cops involved because he’s been regularly put back on meds. I was really struggling before and with all the buildup to this, and the “final” event really unnerved me and I’m not really sure how to pretend everything is fine and the same. They make my skin crawl and I’m afraid it’s never going to be over. I don’t know if I could talk to a stranger about how I’m feeling, I don’t even really know how I’m feeling. I just know I want support so badly and everyone is just moving on, which I know is what should happen but I’m really struggling with it and I feel like no one actually checked in with me to make sure I’m actually okay. I know I will be, but the whole backstory around how this happened and who and what my stalker thought I was has me constantly disassociating when I think about it. It doesn’t feel real, it seems like what you’d see in a movie. Sometimes I’m also still worried that it’ll escalate. I feel like I’m the only one still freaked out and even though it’s a scary situation kind of feel like I’m supposed to just get over it but I’m stuck. I can’t be expected to get over something so scary so quick right?

I don’t know. I needed to try and talk about it somewhere. I do have a therapist. I’m just not all here right now. I hope this is appropriate here. Thank you."
307,How do I help my friend with mental health and substance abuse,So my friend is going through some stuff with his mom that is giving him violent thoughts and on top of that he is addicted to drugs. I just want to know how I could help him as his mom works from home and he can’t set anything up to help both of them as she gets mad and yells and beats him. I would go into more detail but I don’t think that’s fair to him as he doesn’t know I’m posting this.
308,How do you get rid of a short temper,"I've always been so quick to anger and it's ruining some of my relationships. I don't mean to get so mad, it just happens. Any tips for managing anger."
309,Worried for my sister being an adult,"I’m 16 and my sis is in her mid 20s. Half of this is me just not knowing anything and being worried.

Everyone wants her to get a job and now she’s job hunting. We’re hoping she gets some friends, working experience and maybe some adulting. All her friends are working, married or studying but right now since her diagnosis she stopped studying and now has none of that. 
**Is this gonna be the best choice for her? 
**She held on to wanting to study and find a job with a higher opening pay for a long time so 


My sister was diagnosed as schizophrenic 10 months ago and after a month and a half she stopped taking her medication because she didn’t want to eat the pills anymore even to fight about it with my parents. So my parents and her came to an agreement to not take all the pills prescribed to her if she controls herself. 
**Is this really wrong or is this ok?

I didn’t know much on how that would affect her but I could see how sad she was that she gained weight from the side effect from one of the pills.
She often tells me she’s sad that she’s shorter than me and overweight. She’s physically strong so there’s that. Now, she’s on a diet but doesn’t eat vegetables and adds on desserts or snacks. **Should I be concerned??

My sister tends to hug and pinch me a lot ever since young but after her episodes and early prescription stuff she’s been doing it a lot. She told me she doesn’t like to feel alone too so sometimes by default she goes to me. She also laughs loudly and a lot at small things. 
** how is this going to affect her being surrounded by coworkers?

Myself- 
**Am I worrying too much? People keep telling me it’s her life and I should just focus on myself but I can’t."
310,Here to listen/help!,"Hello everyone! Especially people from the U.S.

I know things are terrifying right now. We’re in the middle of a pandemic l. Riots are going on everywhere and our president has said numerous times he want protestors shot and killed. 

“When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” 

And I want you to know, despite everything going on. You have someone who cares and loves you more than you know. Even though it doesn’t seem like it, you do. Stay strong, and if you need someone to talk to, feel free to message me."
311,Do you ever wish for a do-over? Like it isn't fair you were dealt the neurological and psychological cards you got?,"I'm having a really rough time right now. You'd think I would be used to the vicious cycle at this point. I have been dealing with mental health issues since I was 8 years old. I'm 36.  

It's always the same old cycle. More broken relationships, feeling so alone and empty. It gets harder the older you get (at least for me)."
312,I’m not really sure if I’m holding onto a grudge that I’ll later regret in my life,So I am a 21 year old girl.. I have a twin sister who I’m extremely close with &amp; 3 older brothers. While growing up all I can remember is my biological mother being an absolute piece of shit (excuse my French but I really don’t give a fuck). She was addicted to coke/other drugs &amp; chose men over me &amp; my siblings every single day of the week so my dad got custody of all 5 of us.. I have not seen her since I was about 3/4 years old &amp; I have a great step mother who’s raised me since I can remember but my biological mother will continue making comments about my twin &amp; I on our house phone how me &amp; my twin sister were raised badly &amp; how we “party a lot” &amp; how she could have done a better job.. she always wants to reunite with us &amp; go out to have a lunch with her...like I’m supposed to just act like everything is fine in the world &amp; she’s the picture perfect mother when she hasn’t done shit for us growing up &amp; constantly has something negative to say about how we are as people now as if she has the right to even say anything. m just worried I’ll regret not getting closure with her before it’s too late considering she isn’t in good health because of her life decisions.
313,Struggling to find the light,"If anyone’s interested in giving this a read, this is basically a glimpse into my struggles with mental health, It’s a very personal take on my life but I feel confident enough to share my story and hopefully help others.

 https://medium.com/invisible-illness/my-nonstop-battle-against-my-own-mind-d3aa9e527a7a"
314,Do I need help?,"Often I find myself with something sharp or someone vulnerable and thinking how easy it would be to hurt someone or myself. I don’t want to, but it just starts filling my head until I ultimately leave to another room to get away from the situation. Just the thought of death scares me and the thought of just how simple it is. Like someone could jump off a building, and their fate is sealed. I remember skipping though scenes in shows like Sherlock or Jessica Jones because of the thought of how easy it really is to end a life. Sometimes I scare myself with how I think; I don’t enjoy it. I also have some fairly juvenile frights like the dark or paranoia when it’s dark out, whether I’m inside or outside.

I’m not suicidal, I’ve never been depressed. I have never taken alcohol, nor have I ever done drugs (other than rare prescriptions for minor stuff like strep). I never have wanted to do anything bad, but I can’t resist the urge to envision it before ultimately running from the situation even though I haven’t ever considered doing anything.

Maybe it’s normal, and people just think devilishly out of boredom."
315,"I’m indifferent to dying, am I depressed?","I feel like I could die at any moment and it wouldn’t matter for me. 

I’m not particularly sad about anything anymore. I mean, I used to be, but a lot of factors in my life have settled down and now all I’m left with is a sense of apathy. 

Before quarantine, I would work 70+ hour weeks with multiple jobs that were pretty physically demanding. I knew it was taking a toll on my body and I’ve been avoiding any type of medical help. I’m young (22F) and my reasoning for why I’m willing to sacrifice my health and work so many hours is because I don’t care if I die. 

Is this a healthy mindset to have? Is this a form of depression? I don’t really know anymore"
316,Some mental problems with my mom,"Some background: i live with my dad (43 M) and my mom ( 47 F), my mom for the last couple of months was really into finding stuff in hystorical paintings, like identifying people in it etc. That is her hobby, but i think she did that too much, and yesterday when i came back home she was pretty scared of almost anything on her computer, because she is ""finding clues"" in almost anything, for her it seems that the posts she sees on her feed resembles stuff around her, like someone is tracking her and somehow changing her feed, her statements are pretty chaotic and make very little sense, it seems she just sees something and instantly believes it. Today she is calmer, but still thinks someone is trying to track or make fun of her by somehow showing her clues or something on her facebook feed? I (16 M) wanted to ask some advice what me and my father should do, if you have any questions, please let me know. English is not my first language so im sorry for any mistakes."
317,My expectations for life are HIGH,"I’m afraid that I won’t live out my dreams. I want to be an astrophysicist. I want to find out the secrets of the universe. I want to go on adventures. I want to travel the world. I want to take an RV around the states with the love of my life. I want to go on midnight adventures with my favorite people. I want to live in Europe for a while. I want to live in a city. I want to live in the Pacific Northwest. I want to walk through every national park. I want to see every beautiful place in this world. I just want to feel alive. 

Keep in mind I don’t have high expectations because I was given everything I wanted growing up. I was abused, and was pretty poor for a portion of my childhood, and I can say i’m not really a fan of my parents. I’m just excited for life on my own, a life I can build myself and that no one else can ruin. 

I know this sounds greedy but I just won’t give up my dreams, I can’t get myself to settle. The thought of settling wants me to give up on any life at all.

I’ve heard that you should learn to be happy with what you have and not always want something more, something I’m working on, but I just can’t imagine a life not in this image. I’m determined to make it happen but I’ve been told it’s unrealistic. Nothing is impossible but I feel so much dread thinking it might not happen. 

I don’t want to work at an office job or a second choice job and make ends meet, doing the same thing every day. The thought of it makes me sick. 

I don’t know what to do I just want to live my dreams and i don’t want to settle. Anyone else feel this way?"
318,Do you think I might have narcolepsy,"I slept through a majority of my classes in middle school and still did in high school just a little bit less. I have always had trouble maintaining a normal sleep schedule. I have fallen asleep standing up multiple times. I have had these episodes where I feel like im becoming paralyzed and have to sit down or almost or do fall over. I have had sleep paralysis a few times. I have had hallucinations without paralysis sometimes up to or over 3 times a night. I had the same hallucinations sometimes if I fell asleep and woke up at school. I slept through dinner a lot and lost a lot of weight and became generally depressed because of all these things. I also was for a short time almost convinced that some of the hallucinations might be real and that I was in a simulation and somehow something I was doing was messing things up or breaking the simulation which looking back freaks me out that I thought that. But I didn't really feel like that for long. Eventually these symptoms got way less intense and I dont really fall asleep at all during the day anymore maybe a few times per week. I also dont really have muscle weakness episodes at all anymore anymore.   
 Im 20 now and I feel like something like narcolepsy cant just go away like this. I still have the hallucinations all the time when falling asleep or waking up and I wake up a lot at night. When all this was going on I was kind of scared to tell my parents about it and now when I tell them about it they just think I have sleep paralysis sometimes or anxiety and just stayed up late back then. So im just wondering if im looking into google medical symptoms too much or if I actually have narcolepsy or some similar condition."
319,Which therapy should I choose?,"After years, I finally decided to go to therapy and now if confused again.
There's so many different approaches I can't really make up my mind.
I was thinking about psychoanalysis since it seems more comprehensive and would probably solve my relational problems, but as I'm frequently zoning out, having anxiety attacks, and my brain is enveloped by fog (depression i think) maybe psychotherapy (cognitive maybe?) or some other treatment would suit my problems better.
I'm searching for opinions and i don't know, perhaps some personal experience."
320,People don't believe me when I tell them about the amount of disorders I have,"I;ve given up on trying to tell people about my ( professionally diagnosed!!) mental disorders because they just say things like ""You're lying for attention!"" which make it worse. 

I wish that all these ""Tumblr girls"" out there would stop trying to make self diagnosed mental illness a trend because it just makes it awful for those of us that really do have mental health issues."
321,i want to live again,ever since i turned 12 4 years ago i haven't been feeling like myself i just have this feeling that im going to die alone and that my family hates me i know that they dont i just have this overwhelming sadness i just want to feel normal not empty
322,Anyone have any advice for someone who’s anger sits right below the surface 24/7?,"I 21F have always had an anger issue growing up so naturally as I got older the problem worsened. It has gotten to the point where pretty much any minor inconvenience can instantly anger me and ruin my mood for hours or even the rest of the day.  Obviously the bigger the inconvenience the longer it takes for me to “cool off” and the only way for me to calm down is time, letting the anger pass on it’s own. I’m beginning to feel hopeless every passing day as this problem effects my job and how I interact with people. I fear that if I don’t find a solution or someway to lighten my mood my anger will eventually consume me to the point where I have little to no patience or happiness with the world around me. Any advice, even harsh, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you &lt;3 I also hope everyone is staying safe during these stressful times."
323,"I want to die everyday. I feel like a shell, and feels like my brain is 5 feet above me. Is this what being a teen is like, or do I need help?","Just like the title says, I always want to die. Every day I’m thinking about wanting to die, and if I would be lucky enough to die of a natural cause.

I could be having a fun day and genuinely laugh, but at the end of the day, I still don’t want to live. I just find meaningless. Why live if it only makes you tired?
It’s like if I were a character in a game, I would have “being suicidal” as a default setting. 

This only gets worse with my hormones every month. From ovulation to the end of my period, my suicidal thoughts gets more intense. I will be constantly on the edge of killing myself for that period of time. 
All I could think about is how to kill myself. And I attempt it just to see if I’m lucky enough to “accidentally” die.  

I’ve tried drowning myself in bathtub by taking sleeping aid pills, wore plastic bag over my head, went to a large bridge to see if I might just fall off from 50m high into the ocean...etc. If I had a gun, I know that I would impulsively shoot myself. 

I’m constantly tired, no motivation at all. I use all my energy to push myself through the day because I am a student and I have to attend classes. I know that if I don’t, I’m gonna fuck myself up in the future too. But then again I’m only living to live one day everyday that I cannot think of future. I can’t motivate myself to do better academically even though I know it. I just cannot concentrate. 
All the things I hear and all the memories I have feels like someone else’s flashbacks. When I’m thinking I feel my brain not concentrating. 
Then I get worse grades and feels more awful and the cycle goes on and on. 

At this point I’m only living so my parents don’t have to see me dead. And it’s difficult. I just feel trapped in a life. I want to not live anymore. I’m sick of this feeling. I’ve fought with depressive state for 4 years now. It doesn’t get any better. It’s relapsing. All the therapy session. All the appointments. All the effort I put into stopping myself from self harm.

I started taking pills to see if these symptoms become better but it doesn’t. 
I talked about mood swings and how depending on mood my suicidal tendency changes, but adults around me (including psychiatrist I visited) said it’s probably the teens hormones.

Is this what teen is like? Always wanting to die, only think about ways to die? I need help."
324,I think it’s coming back...,"Around 2015 I was diagnosed with schizo affective disorder as well as bipolar. 

I went through I very tough journey. 

Long story short, I was able to control myself without medication. 

I own my own business now. 

But recently, about a week now, I’ve started seeing hallucinations again.

I know they’re not real. I know it’s actually not there. 
But I LITERALLY see it. 

I am married and am 3 weeks postpartum. I’ve been really sad recently but not to the point of postpartum depression. Just like feeling blue sometimes. Other times I feel super great! 

So my husband doesn’t know anything about this. And like I’ve also started to get these massive migraines for the past 4 days. 

Do you guys think my hormones are triggering me to feel this way??"
325,What would you call this feeling?,I have always had a faint sort of feeling that I could never put a name to but now I have a good way of explaining it. I’m just not sure what to call it. How would you a describe a constant feeling of not being human? I feel like something shapeless that’s been shoved inside a human body and now has to convince the world of its humanity daily by observing other humans and mimicking them. It’s pretty irritating.
326,i had my first schizophrenic episode,i had my first schizophrenic episode yesterday it was so scary the voices were unbareable they were so loud. i can hear the voices whispering am gonna try and ignore them

328,I need help for my sleep,"*At the time that I'm typing this is at exactly 4:10 AM where I live and I doubt I'll be able to sleep normally after writing this either... *

We all know that we have to maintain a healthy sleep schedule by going to bed within the times of 9-12 and have at least 8 hours of sleep to keep us going everyday. It should very much be a norm and what everyone should follow but not in my case... 

I did very much stay up a bit late starting from 1 AM and slowly increasing those numbers as the days go by. Sooner or later, me and a friend decided to all night a game to grind something we found interesting, turns out, that's what would tumble my whole way of living as of now until who knows when.

When I went to bed around those times of 1-3 AM before that all nighter, I would always sleep fine and wake up in the afternoon or slightly later but at least having something to do. But once I hit that day, I knew I had to sleep but for some odd reason, my body refused for hours to go to sleep despite my condition and it kept going until the afternoon. I went to bed and soon enough, those hours I missed were made up by me waking up at night at 8. And this wasn't the worst case scantily yet.

On that same day where I woke up at 8, I felt awake of course since my sleep hours have made up and I just went ahead to eat dinner. Sadly when I at least tried to fall asleep, my body refused and it kept me up all day, and since I only ate breakfast, my body was starving, even after I ate dinner and I wanted to eat more and more. I just simply ate whatever was there to offer but it was never enough. At the end, I just decides to ignore it and try again to fall asleep or even nap. 

Nothing. 

No sign of me ever wanting to go to bed. I tried as to even watch boring videos on my phone to pass the time and get me tiresome but it instead made me crave more useless videos. Before I knew it, the first beam of sunlight pierced my bedroom's window. It was already 7 AM and too late to even bat an eye to close shut.

Before I knew it, the cycle continued, I stayed up all night trying to sleep but nothing worked. Slept in the afternoon, wake up at 8, attempt to sleep, crave food after dinner at midnight, attempt to sleep, stay up, slept in the MORNING, wake up at 8. It got worse, now I couldn't even stay awake until the afternoon and instead I just feel right to sleep as the sun rose up. What made it unbearable too was that I missed the whole day by sleep for nearly 12 hours... I can't understand why and it's been like that for days. Hell, this might even be nearing my second week already of this vicious cycle...

For the past 2 days including today, I managed to stay up until the afternoon and made a plan to attempt and stay up for the whole day to finally flip the switch at night instead of the afternoon but day 1 didn't work and today, I managed until 1 PM and made the mistake to fall asleep on my chair and be tugged to my bed from my brains orders and nap or sleep until 5 PM. Once again, I felt awake even I only slept for 4 hours... I didn't understand why or how...

Right now I'm struggling to go to sleep at night and am wasting not only my productive time but also everyone else's time that need my help in my family by sleep from the morning to night. I don't know how to solve this as I've tried everything and I just hope someone can give me advice why this has been happening to me and how to stop it...

TL;DR
My sleep schedule has been fucked up for nearly 2 weeks now and can't manage to go to bed at night and only then sleep for the whole day and having it repeat all over again.

Please give me any advice that I can listen to since I doubt I'll be able to go to sleep tonight either as it is now 4:34 AM and nothing has changed.

All help is welcome. 

Thamk you."
329,Inferiority Complex in a Newly Graduated Physician.,"How much does international practicing rights/ recognition matter to a physician? I have a D.O. and matched to orthopedic surgery residency this year. I had to do a lot of hard work to be where I am: I took and aced the USMLEs after months of studying, and after the merge this year, all our residences are ACGME accredited, and it was so hard to be from a lesser known American medical school and match. I will be an American orthopedic surgeon no matter what, God Willing. Still when I hear about the fact that my MD counterparts with the same exams and residencies may have more recognition outside of US, I feel left out. Is this a first world country problem? My program directors love me a lot. I most definitely will have a high paying starting salary. I don’t know why this lacking stings me still. Weirdly, this feeling turns into a slight sense of inferiority, leading to mere animosity against other doctors. It’s like all the other 1,999 puzzle pieces are there in my life, but that 1 piece of a comparatively lower number of countries giving my degree international recognition (74 currently) stings me. Idk how to feel. Doctors wanna come from outside and practice in the US, while I am feeling lowly about my US credentials."
330,"My Sexuality Is About To Snap, I Don't Know How To Help Myself.","I'm 25/m at the end of next month. 

I am seeking professional help and psychiatric evaluation. 

I was already evaluated 3 years ago in the summer of 2017 at the age of 22. 

I am perverted and sexually obessed. 

I keep thinking of all the times I got to see girls belly buttons. The majority are girls I went to high school with. 

I have a mild addiction to cannabis as well as alcohol but my masturbation addiction is by far the most severe of the 3. 

I often spend multiple hours on end attempting to achieve an orgasm/ejaculate and many multiple times a day. 

My clothes are literally soaked in sweat, as if you submerged them under water. 

I think of all the belly buttons I saw of the pretty girls I went to high school with like 10 years ago. 

I also have these disturbing and obsessive thoughts, often thinking of them topless in only their panties and then I also think of their nipples belly buttons.

Sometime around the age of 3 in circa 1998, My mom used to deliberately/intentionally undress infront of me. 

Because I noticed and was interested that the female human nipple is far bigger than the males, I was also obsessed with the way underwear/panties fit. 

Since I was about 3, I have had a disturbing obession with various women in their underwear/panties with their belly buttons and nipples both freely exposed. 

These thoughts produced an extremely pleasurable feeling of both comfort and sexual arousal. 

Then in highschool my belly button obession got out of hand. 

Anytime I accidentally saw a pretty girls belly button, could have been for a split second or even less. 

I would wait till I got home and go ""rub one out""."
331,Hallucinations,"Recently I’ve been experiencing hallucinations, at least I think so. What I think happened up until this post was posted is that I was awake for most of the night. I can confirm I was awake until at least 12. But from there, my mind kind of failed me? I heard yelling, and people coming down to by my room. I know for sure the people talking by my room was probably false. Which I can assume the yelling was partly false. But I was literally wide awake when I heard it again. But this time it was a continuation of what had happened before. I’ve been known to have weird wake ups, like me thinking I’m still in my dream after opening my eyes and knowing I’m awake. Is this normal? What do you guys think is the problem? Because it only happens after or before I’m in sleep mode. I’m very awake and aware of my surroundings when I’m not sleepy. The one thing I wanna mention, is unlike other days, my hallucinations sounded real. I’m not gonna go into specific detail over them. But I need help.."
332,I feel like the should've died?,"I didn't get in an accident or have a relative or pet die, I just haven't felt ""normal"" since I was young. To preface this I am 13 and have had shitty metal health for years. I feel like I've aged and because of this I think I should have already died, I feel as if to much have happened for things not to have come to an end already.

 I don't understand why this is happening? I know it's not normal but it feel that this is just natural progression at this point, y'know?"
333,"Something is wrong with me, but I can't figure out what it is.","I don't know if there is a proper term for it, but I've thought of myself as a ""mental chameleon"" since elementary school.

I will:

-Overanalyze everything others say or do to reassure myself that they accept me and that I fit in

-Feel extremely on edge at the slightest hint that someone might dislike me and adjust my actions/words accordingly

-This results in everything I say feeling ""forced"" and disconnected from what I truly think/feel

-I micromanage everything I say and do in order to ""blend in"" with whatever group I'm currently around

 -I'll go as far as to completely fabricate stories about myself that will make them like me (I don't do this as often now that I'm older, but in my school years it was really bad)

-I'll compulsively agree with the opinions of the person/group I'm currently around even if it utterly contradicts how I actually feel

-I never feel like I truly belong anywhere, even with family or close friends. I constantly feel like I'm out of place, an ""other"" who has no true kindred spirits

-I used to be very outgoing and social as a kid, but nowadays I feel better when I'm alone because I don't have to worry about putting on an act

-Yet even when I'm alone I find myself confused about who I truly am as an individual, so I alter my behavior to fit with whatever current mental image I have of what a ""normal"" person thinks or feels

-I will appear completely put together on the outside even though on the inside my emotions might be going haywire

-I often feel like I can't understand or process my own emotions. Like they're in some foreign language that I can't translate into English

-On that same note, I'm unable to be completely honest with my therapists because of that emotional ""disconnect"", which results in me leaving the appointments feeling bad because I'm not truly ""opening up"" or properly conveying what I'm thinking or feeling

I'm really curious to know if this is something other people also struggle with, or if I'm just as alone and ""other"" as I always feel I am."
334,What mental illnesses is this?,So for the longest time I can remember if I concentrate on a thought ie. If this were to happen or if I was having a conversation with this person. I tend to get lost in my thoughts. Now this sounds normal but it scares the living shit out of me. It gets to the point where what ever I'm saying in this thought I end up muttering and I loose my grasp on reality. Then suddenly i catch myself muttering and I snap out of it. It literally feels like I'm detached from reality when this happens.
335,Memory and anxiety,"I'm having a hard time retaining specific details about conversations I have with people. I don't remember everything I said exactly just a brief summary of topics or things we talked about. I also have a hard time visually remembering without it being blurry, but I don't know if that's because in the moment I wasn't wearing my glasses or if the blurriness came afterwards. I feel like maybe this has to do with anxiety. I'm so overwhelmed and active/stimulated that afterwards when I calm down the retention of the event isn't good? I'm just trying to find a reasonable explanation. Comment if you experience something similar or have a different idea for why this happens."
336,Documenting a weird panic attack I'm having,"I posted this to r/anxiety about 45 minutes ago and didn't get any response and my panic attack is still going on a full 1hr and a half later so I would super duper appreciate any kind of support you can give. 

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this sorts thing but I'm having a very bizzare panic attack that is very unlike what I've ever had. For the first 20 minutes of it I only felt the physical sensation of the panic attack but for the most part my mind was pretty calm which at least for me seems quite weird, later on the thoughts and emotions started to kick in but not till later which just seems so odd but idk. 

So I made 2 audio clips of me just sorta explaining how I felt cause I've never really documented it before and I thought maybe someone here would find it helpful or interesting or something, I don't know. Or maybe someone could explain why this panic attack feels so much different. So I don't wanna go into to much detail of my life history and all that crap but just for context of a few things, I'm 16/f and I was diagnosed with anxiety back when I was 10 and had my first real full fledged panic attack but I'm sure I've had anxiety even longer that that due to having a mom who had borderline personality disorder, I was diagnosed with depression maybe about a year later or so I don't remember. But yeah my mom abandoned me and my dad when I was 13 and I also mention Ethan who is my boyfriend. If you need more context for something let me know, I've just already wrote a lot and I don't wanna write an essay especially because no ones probably gonna listen to these clips anyway😅 but here ya go

Also if there's something better than SoundCloud to upload audio to let me know but this was all I could think of for doing that kinda thing

337,"Feeling bad again, need advice on the next step","The past year and a half have been a bit tough because of my recently diagnosed hyperthyroidism, it’s been an emotional rollercoaster, as my hormones have been totally out of whack, and I suspect the problem was sub clinical since my early teens.

The treatment for it is progressing fairly well, but my mood has been affected too, and use of coping mechanisms such as bing eating, smoking weed, over picking of things like scabs etc. These mechanisms intensify some self destructive behaviours, for example I have struggled with sleep procrastination for as long as I can remember, to the point where my sleep pattern has recently been totally reversed and then back again a few times.

For the past few weeks the depressive feelings, feeling of self hate, paranoid and defective thinking, with a side order of mania sometimes, have all come rushing back.

I tend to pause my whole life during these periods, and only with a push from someone else will I take care of anything important. Except for seeing friends in an effort to retain them, since socialising can often act as a spiral downward.

I’ve never had a psychiatric assessment before, only therapy for anxiety and depression. 

I’ve talked about my problems honestly with someone I trust yesterday, and have woken up at a reasonable time somewhat well rested today, feeling much more in control, but what happened to me in recent days has happened to me before, and I really want to take care of it.

I’ve read a lot on psychological disorders, only recently started to read watered down scientific literature, and have repeatedly convinced myself that I suffer from a number of different disorders, ranging from personality disorders to ASD and ADD. I feel biased in the way I think about these things, since I’m looking for something to pin all my problems on, but I relate to many symptoms described in these disorders, and I badly desire to be free of them.

I have contacted my endocrinologist (thyroid doctor, and I’m about to have a phone call with them. My trusted friend recommended that I see a therapist I stopped seeing a couple of years ago, who’s a trained psychiatrist and has helped me greatly in the past, but her style isn’t really to start dishing out diagnoses, which I have craved for a long time now.

I’m worried that the same issues have dominated my entire life, but I don’t know what to do about it. Seek a diagnosis? How much should such a thing matter to me? Or just work on staying healthier and not exacerbate whatever is happening to me? I don’t want to become a burden for others in my life, but I don’t know what to do.

Long post so I appreciate that you may not have read all of it. Hope you’re all doing well, and I’d appreciate any advice, thanks."
338,When should someone be hospitalized for severe depression?,
339,I’m lost and scattered(I apologise for the long rant),"Background information:

I’m an Australian high school student(yr10) and I’ve had both depression and social anxiety for 5-6 years I’ve reached the point in my life where I’m hopeless and suicidal I have a psychologist(headspace) but nothing has changed or improved if anything I’ve become more anxious, antisocial and suicidal/depressed I’m the youngest son of my family having an older brother who’s five years older, I have a both parents present and a grandmother and young uncle who lives with(we have a big house so it’s not an issue) I have a multitude of issues that play into my mental illness such as insomnia, antisocial behaviour and other things that could cause me to be labeled as insane or schizophrenic to some because i hear voices my family and school and my academic ability all add to my issues.

In my school at the very least year 10 is a big deal because it decides whether or not you go to year 11 and onwards my grades have decreased significantly as my mental state has deteriorated I’ve attempted to commit suicide 5 separate times my family don’t understand nor do they believe I have depression though I’ve been diagnosed twice. They don’t understand I struggle to get out of bed the only thing driving me is fear because my parents have never let me stay home unless I had a very severe illness nor have I pulled sick day I’ve been sent home by teachers but I usually try to refuse because though my parents don’t physically abuse me they do mentally and emotionally without realising they claim that mocking and belittling me to the definition is telling the truth and giving me advice. My brother is better than them in the sense he doesn’t antagonise me OFTEN but when he does it usually breaks me he does agree I have social anxiety but his understanding of mental health as a whole is from one semester of uni and he thinks he’s more reliable than a doctor and psychologist. He’s better in the sense when I’m in social interactions and I’m with him he will help me but the problem lies is though we have our moments where we are good brothers the moments when he’s a  fuck head out ways the good. He would berate me for wasting my height and not doing sports, or my choice of friends or how I can’t talk to girls as a whole though he acknowledges my social anxiety and that’s just my brother my mother is worse because she thinks whatever she says is true no matter what evidence you provide. She denies the fact I have depression and when I show symptoms she yells at me so I her presence I have to smile or act happy because she thinks self harm or suicide is me being a brat. Granted she had a harder upbringing than since she was child during the Vietnam war and escaped to Australia but she shows empathy and sympathy and cries when she hears about children with depression or anxiety but when it comes to me she treats me like trash and looks at me disgustedly when I have moments of anxiety. My dads the same but more ignorant and I can never understand what he’s thinking. 

Where My problem lies is I don’t know how to feel about this are my parents abusive unknowingly or am I just overly sensitive I can’t go to school with out feeling like shit but I go because anywhere is better then home because I have one teacher who supports me and knows about my issue but at the end of the day I self harm on the regular I have anxiety and panic attacks everyday and I don’t even feel safe in my own house every night I take my sleep meds and cry myself to sleep because I know this is my last year of school and I’m a dumb 6,4 half Asian loner  kid who has issues with motivation studying or talking to people all I feel is sadness fear or nothing I play games or watch anime to forget my pain for a moment but it doesn’t work and I’ve now started smoking weed because I don’t know what I am or what do for all I know I could have no issues and I’m just over sensitive brat I don’t know what to do I’m scared and lost because life keeps moving and I’m being left behind with no aspirations or aptitude’s 

I’m asking for help and maybe for a friend but I don’t like wasting people’s time so seeing this enough for me

I just don’t know anymore"
340,I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me but figured I would write out something that happened,Last night I was eating crackers or something and I left to go do something and my mom (I trust my mom the most out of anyone) was right there and I ate another one and to me it tasted weird and I was fully convinced my mom drugged me or gave me sleeping medicine or poisoned me and I asked her if she gave me sleeping medicine and she said yes (she was joking but I was already really paranoid) and so I was freaking out and I started getting dizzy and feeling like I was going to pass out (placebo affect really said 😳) and then she was like “no I really didn’t” but I was still really suspicious and stuff but nothing happened so I don’t think she did but it was really scary in the moment  to be honest
341,I feel really bad,Everything in my life is falling apart and I don’t know what to do about it. I‘m having suicidal thoughts.
342,i just want to lie down and die,I'm exhausted of fighting. I lost my wife in November of 2019. I'm just living with her things and reminders. We were just starting our life together and it's all gone now. I just want to give up and be with her again. I'm sorry to put this out there but I just feel like I need to say it somewhere.
343,What the hell was that? depersonalization? derealization? a neurological issue?,"So the past few days I have been having the following symptoms...... They get much worse when walking outside:

Dizziness, a feeling of derealization/depersonalization, extremely low and apathetic mood, extreme fatigue accompanied by nausea and intense pressure in my head, brain zaps, feeling as if I am about to pass out and generally as if whatever I am experiencing is a nightmare kind of like my brain is feeling claustrophobic so hard to explain. Is this most likely a neurological or psychiatric condition? Any thoughts/experiences? I have trouble thinking straight and forming sentences as well"
344,"I just want to be 'normal', thinking-out-loud rant","I moved abroad in January, I have a very good job and a great long-term relationship. On the surface, I look very successful. It's so exhausting to seem this way outwardly, while desperately craving to be 'normal'. 

I'm depressed, and therefore on antidepressants. I don't want to be, I'd love to be able to function without them and be like a 'normal' person.

I have a serious food addiction, I'm obese, in a hot country and really suffer with it. But I am absolutely obsessed with food. Why can't I eat like a 'normal' person?

I have OCD, and I pick my skin on my scalp to the point that it bleeds, all day everyday. I cannot stop, I'm getting bald patches and it makes me feel worthless that I can't stop such a trivial thing. Why can't I just be 'normal'? 

I'm just thinking out loud here, but I REALLY needed the vent."
345,is it just anxiety or some serious mental issue?,"Here I am, I am a 32 years old guy, it has been 11 years I am under medication, and I am under risperidone and nozinane.  
I feel pretty good besides what happens to me and what we all call just life.  
but the weird thing is, I don't seek for a job and I stay home 24/7, I get out rarely, and I don't feel the need to get out and search any job.  
are these signs of anxiety?  
I am not seeking diagnosis as it is not ethical and nonprofessional for a psychiatrists in here, I just want your opinion."

347,I think everyone hates me but just doesn't know it yet," I think I need help from a therapist and psychiatrist but since covid got more threatening the therapist and psychiatrist I had just started going to haven't answered my calls.

  I don't have any friends outside of the internet, where I talk to a small group of people I've known for about 3 years now. A few months ago I had a falling out with my best friend and overtime after giving details to my other friends they had told me it wasn't entirely my fault but I still feel like it is. My best friend at the time wanted to talk to an old boyfriend who had caused a ton of drama in the past and really hurt my friend and I told them I didn't think it was a good idea to talk to him again since he had hurt you so badly before. My friend got very upset and said it was emotionally manipulative to say something like that and that i was a bad person for making him choose who he talks to like that. After that happened he stopped talking to me as much and I let our relationship crumble away.

  I have issues with my dad I don't know how much this contributes but I feel like it has some weight in what's happening to me. at about 5 I got Lyme disease and since that point 8 haven't been able to do things thst the average healthy person can. My immune system is weak and I easily get sick. At around seven when my dad realized I wasn't going to get better and I think the stress of trying to take care of an incredibly sick child made him seperate himself from me entirely after a certain point. At 8 he stopped cooking for me and told me if I wanted to eat I needed to make my own food because it was too much work. Whenever I come down the stairs or enter the same room as him, he will shout no at me and tellme to leave. Speaking to him in any amount makes him incredibly angry with me and as much as a good morning will make him lose his patience and demand I go bother someone else. Lots of other things have happened but whenever I try to express that the things he says to me are hurtful he'll mock me and tell me to kill myself if I'm that upset. At this point I try my best to ignore him and move around the house as quietly and least intrusively as I can.

Sorry for ranting I haven't even gotten to my problem exactly but I think I'm using this as a journal almost now I'm sorry and now I feel too anxious to reread what I've written.

The friends I still have are good people, and they seem to care about me from what I can tell, but since about four months ago I have had this deep, unignorable feeling of dread trying to build up courage to talk to them again. I feel like I have done something deeply wrong and immoral and that the more I speak with them the more they will realize tjst they cannot stand me anymore because of who I am. No one has told me that they're mad at me but I feeel like everyone is but maybe doesn't know it themselves yet. I feel like I am doomed to destroy everything I care about and want in life. I feel this intense fear that I have done something so wrong and unforgivable to the world that I feel like I need to apologize to everyone I meet for burdening them. It's slowly become worse over time and I haven't been able to get into actual voice calls with anyone in a very long time, sometimes I respond to messages they send, and they seem concerned for me and I just feel so guilty about worrying anyone. I really want to be forgotten, so I cannt hurt anyone else. I don't know if I've hurt people the way I feel like I have,i try very hard not to hurt people's feelings and I just want everyone to be happy. I can't get over this feeling that I am a detriment to all good progress people can make in their lives. I want to leave everyone and everything and stop existing so it doesn't bother anyone anymore.

Again I am sorry for such a long rambling post, I know that this is a problem and I know I need help but now I don't know where to get it and I don't know how to tell my friends how I truly feel. I feel paralyzed in total fear. I am not trying to ask for pity or to inconvenience anyone who reads this and I'm sorry if this is very dramatic of me. Thank you for reading if anyone does."
348,Talking to my parents regularly has been surprisingly great for my mental health,"I (22,F) generally have a tough time reaching out to my friends on a regular basis and this has just lately begun because a phase of intense depression/anxiety (contemplated suicide) and a horrible breakup.

This is the first time I tried to completely isolate myself from everything and everyone except my parents. My parents (especially my mother) and I've had some troubles over the years but it's mostly talked about and resolved and I know they feel bad for certain things. There are certain aspects I've derived from them but I'm not mad at them. I think they were just trying to figure themselves out too. They're constantly now trying to be better not just for me, but for themselves and trying to understand my point of view which I appreciate a lot.

I find it easier to contact my parents (especially my dad) than my friends because I have less social anxiety towards them. This hasn't been the case over the years but it has been for a couple of months now especially after COVID. If I have nothing to say to them, they'll go on with the mundane things they did or are planning to do which I find refreshing to listen to. Sometimes I go in a rut where I don't contact anyone and just keep on sleeping. Texting my friends doesn't help a whole lot and because of the breakup, I have this thing that people aren't permanent in my life. But I do have one set of parents who will always love and care for me.

I know everyone doesn't have the privilege to say/do this, but if you can, try to talk to your parents once in a while. It's life-changing, I promise you."
349,First really vivid hallucination.,"So last night I was lying in bed, really tired and I had smoked a bit. I started seeing really weird things like a lamp that wasn’t there and a cat but they went away quick. Then I saw a pair of feet wearing pink fluffy socks, kicking from under my bed. I could like hear the shuffling sound and I just stared for like 15 seconds. I moved and it went away lmao. Idk what I should do and I’m so confused because I only ever get slight hallucinations 😅"
350,"Any advice on where I can discreetly seek help? Extreme forgetfulness, mood swings and suicidal thoughts","A disclaimer first that I don’t live in the US. (17yr)
I have always suffered with bad anxiety and stress. I have regular headaches (1-2 times a day) and get severe mood swings, extremely forgetful (moreso than before) and have contemplated suicide, all of which have gotten exponentially worse since lockdown has begun. I want to seek help but I do not want to tell my parents, as mom refers to mental illness as ‘psychologically wrong’ or other terms which are a bit....iffy. Parents cause a lot of stress, as did exams. However exams have been cancelled (I was a gifted program equivalent student and expected to do well, which caused a lot of stress) and it has left me feeling goalless and empty. 

Looking online has revealed I have most of the symptoms of depression, but I do not want to self diagnose. However my country’s refer yourself to a therapist service does not apply/extend to my home area and GP. How can I seek help?"
351,I don’t know what to think,"I have moments in time where I feel weird, I don’t feel like I exist and i’m watching life through my eyes and almost like I cannot feel. I have an intense moment of emotion where my girlfriend tries to console me, after crying intensely I simply do not feel sadness, happiness, anger or anything really. I have been taking walks and it seems to clear my mind, I’m curious if the sudden stop of emotions is bad and if anyone has felt the first scenario before.

352,JUST A HELP,"&amp;#x200B;

I recently recorded a podcast related to mental health if you do mind hearing it , i am sure it will help you just go on and click the link below

[Overthinking : Control your mind by Miss.Fun • A podcast on Anchor](https://anchor.fm/muskan-gulati/episodes/Overthinking--Control-your-mind-ee4t4l/a-a279bgk)"
353,Mental illness,Hi everyone iam new here i have had mental illness for years nice to meet all of you
354,what type of message would you want from a friend if you were depressed?,"A friend of mine seems to be going through a rough time, has ghosted/stopped messaging me a lot just sent me two saying she's distancing herself from people and that she has her moments in life

I haven't overwhelmed her with messages at very most one a week. Been 3 weeks since I've sent her one just wondering ideas what to send or what messages people who have ghosted others would want them to be sent

Just after some ideas, thank you"
355,I hate my dad but he's dieing and it hurts me,"So to start it off my dad has Multiple Sclerosis aka MS. It's from what I understand gonna kill him in 3 to 4 years. He's in constant pain as his own body attack's his nerves. And no matter what he'll die. 

I often thought/think I hate my dad, well because he's a shit person. He cheated on his wife with my mom and cheated on my mom with another women. He had three women pregnant at once. And he has really bad anger issues and hasn't always treated me and my 7 other siblings nicely. And so I always thought he was a scum bag. I always hated going to his house ect. I felt like garbage, I felt like I was used and throw out. I still feel this way

But now I'm older and I have to push those feeling aside and I need to focus on what's next. I wasn't really bothered when he told me he was gonna die. It didn't matter to me, it didn't really hurt yet. 

Then I watched this stupid fucking movie that just hit me. Iy was about a girl preparing her fiance for when she died (she was terminally ill in the movie). It mad me realize that he was kinda doing the same thing. He's been doing things to raise more money and started a little business. He's doing what he can to minimize the damage his death will cause. And realizing that made me break down into tears. Because I really don't want my dad to die, I want him to live, I want him to take me out fishing like we use too. I want him to cook for me, I want him to hug me. I want to see me raise kids ect. But I'm not gonna get that. And it's not fair, it's not fucking fair. 

But I have to be strong for my siblings, and for my dad. But I don't know if I can mentally deal with this death. I know I have minor depression. And it flares, like when my grandpa died. I tried to kill myself a few times. And I don't want that to happen again. So basically is there a way, I can pace myself mentally for his death. I want to be ready to lose him, I don't wanna have a break down when he dies ect. Any input on this would be really nice."
356,What is the clinical diagnosis for one scene in the 2019 joker movie?,"The scene in particular was when arthur fleck was watching the talk show hosted by deniro. 
He fantasises that he was sitting in the audience of the talk show and was called out by deniro to come up on stage. Once on stage dinero tthen I teraxts with him, saying how wonderful he is etc.   This all happened in Arthur's head . A long drawn out fantasy of what he wished/reanacted what never happened .

Is there a clinical name for that type of "" thoughts or delusions""?"
357,"Conflicted on whether to spend my attention on my own mental health journey, or towards supporting and joining those who are fighting for justice and change.","I don't know if this entirely fits, but it is in context of my long term mental health struggles, so I'm posting this here. 26M. I am a very introspective and quiet person, working to escape the chains of social anxiety and depression, which has left me with an inadequate (basically nonexistent) level of emotionally honest relationships. I have been progressing towards an understanding of my anxiety, emotions, and values. The thing I yearn most for is to be able to express emotions with others, and to use those emotions and other skills in a productive way. I could continue on my lonely path towards accepting myself, but recent events have highlighted a path I haven't noticed or considered previously. 
I believe what is happening now, people of all backgrounds standing in solidarity against an unjust system, is valuable on a much larger scale. 
I have been preparing for a 6-month Backcountry trail crew season, and am prepared to sacrifice most of my unnecessary comforts for a good cause. However, after attending a peaceful protest, hearing the sentiments and rhetoric on both sides, I feel that this movement is far more important than the direction I have been going towards in life. On top of that, this movement is full of love and human connection, the likes of which I crave more than I can bare. I am prepared and willing to make sacrifices, without needing to change much. 

I could continue to learn about my mind and society from an external, philosophical manner as I have been, but simply understanding what shapes my actions, and the actions of humans, and society overall, doesn't make any difference unless acted upon. I just doesn't feel right to remain so introspective and detached.  

Is this a chance to finally put my empathy to good use? If so, how can I get involved?"
358,I don’t know if this belongs here,"I’m not sure if this belongs here but here goes. 

I’m stuck in a situation of feeling terrible everyday and barley getting sleep due to a mind racing with thoughts or worries and things I’ve witnessed and feel deep about my mother is constantly complaining about me not sleeping and when I’ve tried to talk about it she always has her “correct opinion” I’m pretty unsure of what to do I have no clue if I have mental illness just venting my thoughts here. Thanks"

360,Are emotionally dependent people aware that they are sometimes being abusive and manipulative?,"I don t know if this is the right place to post but I felt the need to put this somewhere.

So my brother is in an extremly toxic relationship,his girlfriend is extremly emotionally dependent on him wants to be with him all the time, says she can t live without him and that she loves him very much, she is extremly jeaolous and possesive, checks his phone all the time, she had very often episodes of anger and jeaolousy over nothing. One time he went out with his friends without her and his battery died and when he went home he had 34 missed texts and missed phone calls from her, very rude and angry texts though she knew he was out with his friends and she knew his battery died. And another time ,after like 6 moths he wanted to break up with her and she was crying and shaking. She says that she loves him but she doesn t really shows it. She doesn t seem to care about him,his needs, she wants to control him in doing what she wants so that she can feel secure in the relationship. He can t be himself or express himself cus she is always criticising him.

I also noticed that she is very abusive towards him makes him feel guilty when he is trying to express himself. At the beggining of the relationship she always gifted him things like clothes  and always cook food for him  and always gave him a lot of attention . But I don t think she did that from the love that she says  she has for him  but to put pressure on him ,to make him obligated to return the favors later in the relationship. He tried so many times to break up with her cus she is so draining and my brother is very stressed with this relationship but all the time she makes him feel guilty saying things like: *I did so much for you, I made sacrifices for you, this is what you think I  deserve?*

How can she think  that she really loves him if she don t think about his needs at all, when she knows that he is not happy but still she wants to keep him ?

Sorry for the grammatical mistakes, english is not my first language"
361,I think there's something wrong with me,"Hello everyone. I'm posting on a throwaway for obvious reasons. I've noticed a thought pattern a few months ago that I've had since I was a very young child. For context: I am autistic so I naturally have a really hard time making connections and forming friendships with other people bc my lack of social skills makes me not understand others very well. I also have a schizophrenic father and my mother has NPD. While I have trouble understanding social norms/cues I still really want to have relationships with other people. So much so that I often find myself fantasizing about having friendship or interactions with other people almost obsessively. Ever since I was really young I would think about forming friendships with people and having conversations with them but never actually have them so my mind has its own world where I interact with people who I, most of the time, have never even spoken to before regularly in my head. Then I become so obsessed with the people I want to have friendships with I try to learn about them and their friends so I can fit myself into the relationships inside my head. But I rarely actually try to make those relationships happen irl bc I know it'll make me look creepy to already know so much about people I have never even spoken to just by looking at their social medias compulsively. And it doesn't help that people put so much information about themselves on the internet either. If someone doesn't have info on them public online I usually quickly lose interest in them and don't fantasize about being their friend. But people who do make it public my brain makes me look up things about them and try to come up with ways to make me an appealing friend to them so I can speak to them. I know it's crazy and very stalkerish. I don't like thinking these things bc they even make me uncomfortable. I've had a stalker myself and it's not fun so I don't understand why my mind has been making me do this since I was a little kid. I don't think I'm dangerous bc I will never go through with interacting with these people, in fact I'm usually a little rude to them if I ever see them in public and they try to interact with me so I can push them away and make sure I don't do anything to make them uncomfortable. I often follow these people on social media that I have seen in my area, feel creeped out that I'm having these delusions about them, unfollow bc I don't want to be tempted to look at them, then eventually relapse and try searching for them on social media again to see what they're doing and fantasize more. There's been a couple of people I've had this cycle with that I have ended up having short relationships with irl after they initiate them surprisingly but I am nervous the entire time about making them creeped out or end up creeping them out on accident so the friendships end quickly bc I'm so obsessed with getting validation/acceptance/closeness from them it probably becomes overwhelming or I do something else that upsets them and I don't realize (bc autism). At least something that's helpful is that some people automatically don't like me bc I am weird which prevents me from having an opportunity to try to form a relationship with them so I can just learn about them from afar and not worry about making them uncomfortable in person. Am I a considerate stalker or something? I'm not sure what to make of this. I've tried googling this but nothing has been helpful for me. I'm in a relationship and have 2 close friends so I know how to have normal relationships with \*some\* people yet I'm still obsessed with these fantasies of being friends with people I'll never be friends with and desperately want the approval of.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm basically rambling at this point. This is really hard for me to talk about bc I've never expressed these feelings to anyone else. I didn't even realize that this might be unhealthy and not normal until recently. It's pretty clear to me that they're delusions and I don't want to have them anymore. How can I stop doing this? I don't understand why I do it so I'm hoping someone can give me insight maybe. Thank you

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm autistic and so obsessed with being able to make friends I accidentally stalk people and imagine having relationships or conversations with them for 70% of my days. Help."
362,"I want to help my friend, how can help her better ?","So I have this friend that's been going through a really tough time these days. She feels trapped in her own life, her family is very conservative so she can't leave the house on her own or do anything. She fears getting out of her current toxic relationship because she doesn't want to hurt him, even though he's mostly horrible to her.

She's been through a lot over the years, she says she afraid of commitment when it even comes to her friends. She's been trying to look for a therapist but this damned country doesn't have any that would even begin to understand. 

She really wants to get control of her life again but something holding her back and if not sure if she doesn't want to tell me or doesn't understand it well enough herself.

How can I help her better, I always am there when she calls to vent or talk things out. But could I do more ? Is there even anything I could do more ? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"
363,“thinking in pictures”,"idk what this is i guess it’s more of a vent than anything else but anyways,

i always think of things in pictures first before the words/internal dialogue starts, when i think of a certain situation or topic in general i always have a visual i associate it with and most of the time that visual doesn’t have anything to do with it. like for example when i think about my bipolar disorder, it could be about my medication or my symptoms or whatever else, i always picture this one area of my workplace and it has nothing to do with it, for some reason my brain just gives me these images 

very random but yeah, anyone feel me? maybe it is normal, ofc it’s normal to picture things but i thought other people only pictured certain things, not every thing that they think about"
364,Safe Place?,Is anyone else's Only Safe place their Therapists office?
365,Can’t do this anymore,"I’m just sort of sick of everything, I’ve had depression for so long I can’t even remember what it was like to be normal I guess. I work a shitty job in retail which makes me hate life more everytime I show up and I want to leave but the fear stops me. I have no friends, or I had one. A girl I met through work who we became close and I felt I could trust her with anything. Then I caught feelings and told her and now we don’t speak because she found it too awkward after saying she didn’t like me that way. The one friend I had, gone. Everything that happens to me I always over think and ruin it. Anytime a good thing or person shows up in my life I push it away as I question why. No one would even notice if I died tomorrow which just shows me how useless I am. I’ve got my parents who are supportive but I just can’t help but feel that it’s not enough and I know I should feel I’m lucky to have that but I just don’t and I feel like I’m just a disappointment to them. I don’t think I could ever kill myself but I wish I would just die everyday 

Genuinely don’t know what I’m doing anymore but I just need to vent and it’s not like I have anyone who cares to do it to so yeah."
366,I had a panic attack,"I was at my boyfriends house and we were laying on the bed, we were talking about me wanting to do something and him not wanting to,  I said I didn't want to force him to do anything and it just triggered something inside. All the sudden i felt dizzy and I didn't want him to touch me. He went into the other room not knowing anything was wrong and for about 20 minutes I was sitting there and hyperventilating. Then he came back into the room and held me until I calmed down. I didn't want him to kiss me or touch my neck for some reason. I do have memorie of being sexually abused in my childhood and I think this may have triggered a memory or something but I can't remember it now. I dont know what to do and I dont want to have another attack."
367,How do I make myself believe that I’m not the problem?,"It’s too complicated to get into too much detail but, I’ve been involved with this guy for over a year now. I love him. I have always loved him. He loved me too but something changed and he told me he doesn’t love me anymore. He won’t talk to me. He told me before it’s not my fault and I didn’t do anything. He told me he was “sorry for letting the relationship get to this point” and that he was “selfish” and wanted “all of the pros and non of the cons.” I have bpd so I can only imagine a lot of the cons meant having to deal with me. I had episodes and outbursts a lot. I’m trying to get better. But he wasn’t perfect in the relationship either, by any means. He hurt me a lot. He was hard to communicate with. We probably just aren’t right for each other but I can’t stop loving him and the pain won’t go away. And I can’t stop telling myself it’s all my fault and that I’m an awful person. I feel like maybe if I realize that I wasn’t too much, but that he just wasn’t enough, maybe I can move on. There’s probably some level of self love that has to come first but I don’t know how to get there while still actively loving him and begging for him to love me back."
368,How do you separate what others say about you and the truth?,"Hypothetical example, let's say your ex girlfriend says you're an immature selfish piece of shit, and your coworker says you're a good dude.

Your family all says that you're a wonderful person, but a stranger says you're a jerk. A girl you dated doesn't like you, but a new girl you're with thinks you're cool.

Someone online says you're something negative, and another person online says that you're something positive.

How do you know if you are good, or bad. How do you know who to listen to? Are you an asshole, or a kind person? Are you mature, or immature?

I said that this was hypothetical, but there is definitely some personal truth of mine spiced in here.

When I go to sleep at night, and sometimes throughout the day, I have all of these voices of people in my head occasionally. Things that people have said or written to me that rack around inside of my consciousness.

""I hate you"" ""I love you"" ""You're cute"" ""You're too short"" ""You're fine just the way you are"" ""You need to grow up"" ""You're immature"" ""You're so mature and far ahead of your peers"" ""You're an asshole"" ""You're thoughtful, kind, and caring""

How do you settle opposing things that people have said to you?

Sometimes people don't know us, or they are being bias when they say something negative about us. Other times maybe they have a point and it would serve us to reflect and improve certain aspects of ourselves.

I feel like I'm just fine the way I am and quite a good person. Can I be selfish sometimes? Maybe idk but if I am it's moreso because when I tried to show people I loved them in the past they always left

Thoughts?"
369,paranoia + aspergers problems vent,"I don't feel like recapping my entire life story but I need a place I can get this off my chest that isn't my therapist's office so

I was diagnosed with high-functioning autism as a kid and paranoid personality disorder about 8 months ago. As a kid my social delays were very severe; I flapped my arms around and rocked back and forth and couldn't talk to another human being without having a meltdown and all your basic stereotypical special ed stuff, so obviously I didn't have any friends growing up and got bullied and made fun of all the time. Once I got to high school I guess something sort of clicked that I needed to act like a normal human being so I outgrew most of those behaviors and progressed to being way more high-functioning to where I can now, sort of, pass as not being on the spectrum and got out of special ed and was able to pass through high-level classes and at least act normal and friendly in public and etc. The fucking issue is because I was such a problem child I never learned any of the basic life skills that most people learn when they're 5, so after some bad toxic friend experiences I've spent the last few years in community college trying to crash course on basic life things everyone else learns when they're 5 like losing weight and how to leave my room in a state that doesn't look like a nuke went off in it and eat without messing up the kitchen and how to buy decent looking clothes and comb my hair and brush my teeth and etc, while the friends I did have in high school are having the time of their lives having the social life and dates that I probably will never, ever have, and I guess you could say that caused my brain to snap like a twig. I had some friends in high school once I got more normal but I've never been on a date, they were almost entirely other guys, and I've never had anything resembling a normal happy social life (I'm 21).

I cut out all my friends I had from high school anyway. I couldn't stand talking to them knowing that my life was permanently ruined beyond repair because of something I was born with while they're off having the time of their lives, and I didn't want anyone associating me with how I was growing up, obese and as the token school short-bus riding special ed weirdo. Community College is super easy, I get straight A's without even reading the textbook. Even before COVID I stayed pretty much entirely in my room because I know they're watching me. The neurotypicals that surround me that were given everything I dream of just by virtue of being born. Every time I go out in public, I can feel their eyes crawling over me, judging me, picking apart every single mistake in how I look and how ugly I am and how my clothes and my actions are weird so they can stare at me, so they can laugh at me, just like they all did when I was in grade school. My therapist appointments are all the same - she always tells me (pre-COVID) to try to go out and meet people and find meetups I like and that the world isn't as bad as I think and I'll be able to have a real social life, but either she's lying or she just doesn't understand, because she's wrong. I cannot approach people and talk to them because they will immediately, without a single thought or question, reject me. They see me, they all see me. They see that I'm on the spectrum, that everything I do is odd, that I have the life skills of a drunk toddler, and they reject me. She always tells me I'm not the same person I was when I was growing up and if I just give people a chance they'd like me and things will be different but they're the same. All of them. It's either I stay alone in my room for the rest of my life or I become resident county freak. I'm supposed to be sending transfer apps this fall but I know real 4-year college will be even worse because then I'll have no option to stay in my room and I'll be forced to talk to all the people who will never be friends with me or treat me as a normal person and basically have the ""reject me"" sign tattooed onto my forehead. I can barely go out of my room because I'm so laser-focused on every single action I take every single moment being used against me or as an excuse to reject and isolate me again.

After I told this all this to my psychiatrist he did some tests on me for a few sessions and diagnosed me with paranoid personality disorder, as if I'm the one with the problem, and he kept using the term ""highly irrational"" to describe my thought processes. But it's not me, it's them, all of you, and I don't understand how i can keep surviving with this pathetic half-life."
370,Medicine Withdrawal Help,"Located in US/South Louisiana

I'm having some issues with medicine withdrawals, and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or can help.

When I went to see my psychiatrist Thursday, he recommended getting off of Zoloft and then starting Cymbalta. However, he wanted to taper off of 200mg to 100mg for a week and then nothing at all, while starting the Cymbalta simultaneously.

I tried it on Saturday, and I've been experiencing so many side effects, predominantly nausea/vomiting, dizziness, brain fog, and brain zaps. I called the doctor's office yesterday, and he wants to taper off of the medicine slower - start taking 150 instead of 100 for a week, and then taper down by 50 each week while continuing the Cymbalta. He also prescribed some anti-nausea medicine.

Today's the first day on the 150s, and I possibly feel worse now than I did before. I haven't really eaten much due to the nausea and my various stomach issues, and the anti-nausea medicine isn't working today. I'm so dizzy and can't really function very well.

Making it even worse, my depression and anxiety have come back in full force.

Any advice on how long this lasts or what I can do? I've found ice chips to be super helpful to keep down liquids, but I don't know what else to do.

Thanks in advance for your help (and reading this long post)."
371,How Do I Deal With My Anxiety ?,[deleted]
372,why can't i be my best friend,"she's gorgeous, she's photogenic, she's so confident and funny and everyone she meets just instantly loves her. She has multiple guys wrapped around her finger, which she only cares about because they buy her things. She's just a perfect person and I wish that I could be like her. 

We got added to a group chat filled with really cool people and everyone on there already loves her, meanwhile none of them even notice me even though we talk the same amount on it. I hate how everyone always immediately loves her, i know it sounds awful but sometimes i wish that people would treat her how they treat me sometimes. 

I feel like such a bitch when i feel this way but I've just gotten sick of seeing people better than me, I don't understand why everyone is so perfect and beautiful but I'm not? How come i had to be the ugliest, most disgusting person in the world? How come I only attract friends that are already miles ahead of me, while I'm stuck being the dumb, awkward, annoying person that's never had someone tell me they were even slightly attracted to me. 

This isn't even half of what I feel, but I know that this nonsensical rant made about 10 different turns in the span of three short paragraphs but I just don't know how else to format this"
373,"I get these things, panic attacks possibly?","Since I was probably about 12 I get these less than 1 minute periods of uncontrollable screaming and crying. It always happens when somebody is yelling at me. I don't get them every time somebody is yelling at me. They happen everytime if somebody is yelling at me about my triggers which is food or weight. This time it was my dad yelling because he found out that even though I take a shower everyday I only wash my hair every other day. I do this for hygiene and convince reasons. If I wash it everyday it gets dry and is a waste of time. I never know when it's gonna happen. I feel in control but not in control. I try to stop in the middle of them and can't stop it. When it stops I'm fully aware of what happened. I know exactly what happened with no blank spots. If the person keeps yelling I don't get it again. I'm not the most happy cheerful person ever, like I don't always go around smiling and talking about puppies and rainbows but I am not depressed. I have no known mental health issues besides this. Everything I look up is kinda what happens but not really. They stopped happening for months then in the past months it happens about twice a week. I don't know what is wrong I just want it too stop."
374,Help me with my project please!,"Hey everyone,

I'm doing a project where I draw different mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, OCD, psychosis and anorexia. Since I only experience 2 of these (anxiety and depression), I'm looking to understand the lives of people with the others so I can accurately portray this in my artwork. I'm really hoping to avoid media stereotypes so I took to Reddit. Please tell me how you would draw your mental health disorders and if there's anything I should avoid! For ethical reasons please only reply if you consent to me using your quote and obviously it will all remain anonymous. Let me know if you want to retract consent after you have posted and I'll take your quote out of my work.

375,I think I’m mental,"I live inside of my head, and sometimes it’s like daydreaming and sometimes it’s like Im not even there. Sometimes it’s worse than others, I don’t trust the people around me and my head always makes things worse than they are.

I was making everything about me and ready our convo felt like I was dismissing her every time she’s telling me something.

I feel like I’m a different person now though. I try to be kind as much as I can but I still have my bad days I guess. God do I hate myself ugh.

378,I cannot take a break from the news bc it’s my job,"Hi, first time poster. 

I work in finance helping people with their goal planning (retirement, college, house buying, etc.) along with discussions about investments. It’s not just a finance job though, it’s a high pressure sales role which already gives me high stress and anxiety.

I’ve gotten to a point with the news and current events where my stomach is doing flips and there is a tightness in my chest and throat. I just want to shut off all news and updates about the world but I literally cannot. I actually have to actively seek out what’s going on, understand how it’s affecting the markets and economy, and be able to talk with clients about how they are feeling/how it’s been affecting them. I do this job bc I care about people, but I am struggling to carry my own stress and burden along with all of the clients I speak to. 

I guess this isn’t really an advice question, I just feel the need to vent. It’s like every day is a struggle to get through, and every night I lie awake dreading the next day and the stress that will come with it."

380,Please give me advice. Should I (23/F) once and for all completely break the contact with my mother off?,"TW: mentions of suic*de, self h*rm, alcohol,

Very long text, but please let me explain.

I've always had a rather difficult relationship with my mom, especially as a teenager.

I was a problematic teen, and I felt like my mom 'abandoned' me for a lack of better terms. 
Thing is, her parents were very strict, + her dad was a narcissist, and they didn't allow her to do anything. She didn't want to make the same mistake, and let me do whatever I wanted. 

Sounds good at first, but it was horrible!

I was 15 when I skipped almost an entire school year because I've been clinically depressed and got bullied. A year before, I've attempted sui*ide and spent a long time in hospital and therapy. Around that time I would spend my time getting drunk with 'friends', smoke weed and so on.

My mom knew about all of this! She even got us stuff when needed, and when I asked if she had no problems with it, she shrugged, and said I was old enough (keep in mind, I was barely 15...).

Looking back, maybe it was a scream for help. Maybe I wanted her to be upset, and finally give a f*ck.

When I was a teen, she divorced my dad, and started her 'own life' because everybody wants to 'control her' which imo is ridiculous for many reasons. Also, my dad loved her a lot, and generally is a very sweet and caring guy.

I never had any problems or fights with my dad, like at all. I still call him every once in a while, and we still talk a lot and I enjoy this very much. I am a lot more like him then my mom, and tbh I am very glad about this, cause otherwise I might be dead in the gutter by now. 

Unfortunately, back then he worked long hours, so I had to live with my mom. I'm not sure why, since she wasn't at home either. She would spend every night with her 'friends' and also often left me alone for several weeks. When she would show up, she was drunk, unless she had to work the next morning (like a functioning alcoholic I guess??).

I tried so often to talk about all of this, but it was as if I would talk against a wall. She would always shame me, and play the victim. She would say, that I should be glad that she is allowing me to have freedom unlike her parents, and that everybody is against her having her own life etc. etc.

I genuinely think she is also a narcissist like her dad (he was really just plain evil! Not only to my mom, but also her siblings. They all say so, and while I wouldn't only believe my mom, I do believe them).

As a teenager, there was a time when I had a panic attack and started to c*t myself in front of her (idk what I was thinking, again, I was a complete mess) and she laughed took the knife, ran it down on my arm and told me to do it again, since I enjoy being a dramaqueen so much. This day/night, I attempted su*cide again, and she didn't care, said I was being dramatic like a dying swan or something. Even though she later stated at some point that she tried to hide all pills from me.


I was too scared to tell my therapist, because my mom would also talk to him at times, and make it look as if I'm being dramatic or 'confused'. He probably knew something was up, but for some reason I always tried to defend her, and it made me feel super guilty and ashamed.


~

I am 23 years old now, and after getting misdiagnosed (Schizophrenia, BPD, and more...) throughout my entire puberty, I only recently received the diagnosis that I am on the autism spectrum, which makes all of this even more difficult for me, but also explains so much!

Apparently autism looks different in woman than in men, which is why I had no idea! I might have inherited it from my dad though, which also explains a lot. I never bothered to tell this my mom btw.

Currently, I am not depressed anymore, and live without medicaments since ~4 years. I feel really proud about this, and grateful! I also moved out when I was 20. Not only into a new home, but also in a new country like I always wanted.

My old home is 3 hours by plane away, which is great. I got rid of all my former ""friends"" and live/work on my own, with new friends that actually care about me. I might not have many, but a few good ones!


I am, however, still in contact with all of my relatives. 
And yup, you guessed it (if you read the title lol) this also includes my mom.

Here's the thing: She calls me, and sometimes I call her. We chat about stuff that happened, our job, how life is and so on.  I've tried to bring up my teenage years again, because I really want to resolve all of these issues once and for all, but (no surprise) she blocked me off and started to talk about completely irrelevant things, saying it wasn't so bad, and I'm being dramatic... It doesn't help that my teenage years feel like a fog in my memory. I remember bits and pieces, but its super weird.

After that, I never brought it up again, and we continued to pretend everything is fine. It is impossible to have any serious discussion with her.

Anyway, this makes me feel like sh*t. Whenever she calls, I feel frustrated. Heck, even when I call her I feel frustrated. Whenever she says a word I feel annoyed, and I dread her visits. (she visits like 2~3 times a year for a week or so, and I am already stressed out a month before she arrives). When she is here, Inwould often hate to excuse myself before I'd get a panic attack.

I have 0 patience with her, and I am always angry, stressed, and thin-skinned. Whenever she talks it pisses me off so much, its ridiculous!

Its especially weird, because I am not an angry person. At all! I never get into any fights with my friends or other relatives. I never yell, I never have the urge to punch someone, and I am not that easy to irritate.

I really feel, that I should just cut her out, but not only am I ashamed if I would do so because she is my mom, I also feel that I can't get away far enough to avoid her. 

I'm in contact with so many of my relatives (especially my younger brother, but also my grandma, dad and so on), and I feel even if I would tell her all of this and break the contact off, there is no way to stay in contact with my relatives and only get rid of her. They all live very close to each other, in a rather small village where everyone knows everyone, and this would make it so hard. I don't know what to do. 

I really love my family, but I can't keep up with my mom. I also feel, that they would be disgusted with me if I cut my own mother off. Unfortunately, in some regards they are still rather conservative.


What should I do?


I am so sorry that this has gotten so long! This ended up more as a rant than I intended. Sorry for my spelling, English isn't my mother tongue.

If you've been reading all of this, thank you so much"
381,Mum won't let me take antidepressants,My therapist asked me to get an appointment with a gp so I can be prescribed some antidepressants because she thinks it would help. I told my mum about it and she didn't want to. She said it might affect my brain since I'm only 15 and it might change my personality. Apparently a few years back when my parents were still together my dad was on antidepressants and he was just irritable and withdrawn all the time. Apparently it took away his personality and he wanted nothing to do with the family until he stopped taking them. Also apparently my uncle (who commit suicide because of drug induced psychosis) took antidepressants that made things worse because the side effects were psychosis and suicidal thoughts. I really don't know what to do because I'm in a really bad place right now and would like to at least try taking medication to see if it would help. I've only ever been on anxiety medication (it was a beta blocker) which didn't really help and after a few weeks of being on it I tried to overdose on them and got them confiscated. Im trying to persuade my mum to book an appointment but she wants to try natural remedies first (regular exercise and some herbal thing that's meant to regulate my mood) but they never really worked for me. Any advise would be welcome
382,"Feeling so ashamed to share my deepest thoughts here, but I need someone that doesnt underestimate my problems","As title, I'm really scared by posting this, but today I think I reached again the peak of ""I cant go on like this"".

**PAST**
I had a troubled childhood, an absent, violent father and a mother that never showed any love.
I also lived with my grandparent, which kinda made up for the love I never got from my parents (even tought its nit the same) and my older sisters (they could literally be my mothers, theres almost 18 years of diffedence).

Because of this I started playing all day alone in my room.
My school years before high school have been pretty much what any adolescent movie is:
The last picked in the ball game and one the laugh at.
I had only one friend which I lost later.

During high school I failed the first year and my situation didnt change, but the following 2 years went greatly.
I managed to feel part of the class, didnt got bullied, had girlfriends and friends as well.

All these girls left me within 1 month, except the first which lasted 9 month until I finally I found the courage to end that toxic relationship even tough I did hurt her feelings.

3rd year came, class changed and I found a vlass full of bullies and what we could call ""cool kids"", even tough I wasnt bullied anymore, but I felt out of place and uncool anyway.
The previous friends I had suddenly forgor about me as if it was a yesterday thing.

During that year I became best friend with my current best friend, so at least I had him.
I was also friend (from the previous year) with a girl which I had a crush on.
Thats it, so I was feeling often alone  as I said, but at least I had them.

18yo, one day my father told me: "" are you balding?""
At first I got mad, I didnt want to believe that, however that stuck in my brain.

Last few school months I started losing a ton, really, a ton of hair wach day on my pillow.
I couldnt watch at myself anymore.
I was so scared.

That year I said "" everything can go to hell"".
I failed school, again because I was sick of that school (even tough now I understand that the schook wasnt the problem) and started studying to become an hairdresser.

What irony.

How can one feel when obsessed my his hairloss in an hairdresser soloon?
My fear became even greater, was almost at the limit.
One day I went with one of my ex classmates (which I dont like, at all) to see a concert.
Worst days of my life.
I kept thinking about my hairloss and I was so ashamed of even existing.
Literally the day i came back, the girlfriend I had left me, withou saying why.
I guessed it was bacause of my hairloss.

That day everything changed.

I left everything and I never left home, ashemed by my hairloss I couldnt go out anymore without feeling as a freak.

I started seeing a doctor, which I still see each 2 week.
That lasted for 3 years.
I didnt never left home except to see my doctor for 3 years.

The last couple of years, after my grandma died, found some courage to go out again.
The only thing that made me make it possible was wearing an hat.

I started living a bit again.

**PRESENT**

I had good and bad times, mostly bad, but I was getting out more and more, until I didnt felt ashamed anymore to go out as long as I had an hat on.

My parents always kept saying that my hairloss isnt that bad, or even denied it existing (even tought we went to a doctor at the very beginning whom confirmed I had AGA)

After 5 years I cant trust them anymore even rough I keep asking them almost on a daily basis what do they see, getting the same exact anwer each time.

I'm 23 yo, still a virgin,not so smart, dropped out of school,balding and I wasnt a cool or handsome guy in the first place.

I just want to live again, but I'm so stuck, I keep thinking about my hairs, I spend hours and hours staring at my mirror each day trying to convince myself I'm not balding.

The answer is always:
I am balding.

I cant keep living inside this house

My only goal is to find someone to love me, but even if I tried these 2 years starting from chatting on insta, each time I met them for the first time they just disappeared nowhere to be found.

I feel so ugly, useless and keep thinking about ending my life but I know I dont want to give up and I'm not that ""brave"" anyway.

I dont know how to get out of this situation.

The only thing I know is that if I accept my hairloss I need shave it, I want to leave that behind, I cant keep  being afraid of this.

Still, I have moments like these quite frequently, but I revert back to trying to convince myself I'm not balding.

I dont know what this post is for, I just needed to get this weight out of my chest, I keep hiding it to everyone except my family, even tough its pretty obvious when a guy wears an hat literally each time for years.

Sorry for writing so much, have a good day"
383,I don't know what i feel anymore,"Hey there, so recently my mental state has been ok, but its kinda super bland, like i'm just in this dull state with kinda no feeling, I used to kinda feel emotions and be able to identify them, like stomach discomfort for anxiety, when there was pressure in my head I'd be angry but those things have kinda left me, and now its hard to tell what I feel, like yesterday I thought I might've lost my dog cause I couldn't find him, now I was looking for him intensely, but I didn't really feel a lot, I found him, but I don't know how I'd feel if I lost him, I think I'd feel bad, but when I thought about losing him its not like I really felt anything, idk, its just kinda confusing I guess"
384,The Pandemic didn't make my brain hurt but the unrest going on here in the U.S. has my anxiety at an all time high,"I dread waking up every morning to hear how many people were shot, arrested, beat, the cars and homes that are burning is all terrifying to me.  

I grew up in a very small and predominantly white town ( Like 99% ) and moved south as a teenager. I was unaware of the racism that existed in my hometown until I grew up and moved away. The only racism I thought I knew before moving was what they taught us in school and what I could see on TV.  It wasn't talked about by teachers or my family.  I didn't know that it was predominantly a white area due to the town being full of racist people who would make anyone not of a Caucasian race being run off.  It just wasn't talked about.

I learned very quickly how divided people really are once I settled in the south. It was something that I had to be taught on how to speak or acknowledge that racism is alive here.  I have always valued the country I was privileged to be born in and want to see the U.S. come back together to be a solid unit.  I stand against hate and I stand against violence.  I want a future for my children, nieces, nephews and future grandchildren.  It breaks me down seeing so much anger and hate in this world let alone the volume of racism that still exists in the US.  I know it can't always be sunshine and rainbows but I fear another civil war and I fear that one day Americans will be pushed to pick a side because we can't build a future together.  That is what terrifies me.

I'm thankful that the town I settled in happens to be a melting pot of people from all across the U.S.  My town walked with the police during peaceful protests. The police took a knee with protesters.  Protesters helped to stop anyone attempting to start a riot and took them to the police.  I know this town is not 100% free of racism but I'm proud to live in this town and call my neighbors friends.  I'm glad my nieces and nephews get to go to school where they're not told they aren't black enough or white enough.  I hope there is more towns and cities  like this one that I call home in which people of all races walk hand in hand to help make change.  

The unrest in the US is absolutely terrifying and I hope we the people can find some peace.  I hope we can put efforts in place to ensure the safety of all.  Black Lives matter and our children deserve a future that is not in a police run state."
385,SELF HELP MOTIVATION VIDEO,"To everybody struggling, suffering, in pain, living a life that doesn’t fit....


I’ve been at the bottom and want to share my motivational speech to you.
You maybe already know that you aren’t alone with your fears, but watch this and share it with whoever needs it.


https://youtu.be/JUNzaBc4Ros"
386,I have Epilepsy. Please share your experience with epilepsy!,"Some Background info: I suffer from anxiety (GAD) and depression.  Later I developed Epilepsy as an adult. It was a long journey towards acceptance, getting better, finding support networks, and being able to manage my own symptoms without medication. At the moment I only take epilepsy medication. 

My first seizure story: I developed epilepsy in college when I was going through a VERY hard time.  My first seizure was in my class in college. I remember looking at the board and then waking up surrounded by EMTs, school safety, classmates, and my professor. 

I didn’t know what has happening. I was SCARED shitless. I mean like this unexplainable fright! My professor softly told me “honey, you had a seizure.” 
And in my head I was like “wtf is she talking about? I never had a seizure before.” 

So logically, I ran (like I mean fucking RAN my ass off, lol) to the train because I was being chased by the school security. The security guards said the school could be liable if something happened. But, I didn’t care. I was overwhelmed, scared, confused, panicked. As soon as I got in the train I could NOT keep my eyes open. A person offered me their seat and I fell asleep almost immediately that I even missed my stop. When I finally got home, my body felt like it had been through a marathon. My whole body ached, muscles were tense. My head felt like it was going to explode. I felt foggy (dream like) and confused. 

Later,  my classmate facebook messaged me asking if I was okay. She told me what she saw. That I had put my head down and then I started to grunt in my seat and shake. Then, my professor got me out of my seat and laid me on my side. I was shaking for 2-3 minutes with foam coming out of my mouth. 

Since then I have gotten, 4 more seizures within a ( 2 year span). I have gotten 3 seizures at work (1 in a staff meeting and 2 with clients). 2 of those seizure were back to back.  
1 seizure happened in the streets that broke my face and I needed stitches. I was alone and had to find my way home. After each seizure I have the same reactions (exploding headache, tense muscles, intense body aches, sleepiness, fogginess, confusion). I was finally seen by a neurologist and got on meds (Keppra x2 a day. 1,000 mg each) I have been seizure free since (1 year and counting) Woohoo! 

However, now I get these feeling of “impending doom” before a seizure. Almost like I’m scared for my life. Like a panic attack but x100. I feel like if I’m about to die! It slowly passes and I don’t get a seizure. My nuero said if I’m not seizing then, the meds are working and unfortunately I have to deal with those uncomfortable symptoms. 

Problem: The doctors said anxiety could not have caused them, I don’t have a tumor, or anything out of the ordinary. So no explanation for my epilepsy. 
When I developed epilepsy people (my family, coworkers, friends) thought I was lying or exaggerating even my own boyfriend. And then BOOM I get a seizure in front of them or at work and now I’m everyone’s little puppy who they “need” to take care of. 

My jobs treat my like a liability. I am FORCED to tell HR just in case I seize at work because I don’t want ambulance called because insurance is expensive. One job even tried to do the most to get me fired without saying it was because of my epilepsy. 

It’s so annoying! I hate feeling like a liability! Why do I need to seize in front of people to be believed?!?! Why do you need to baby me?! Especially when I broke my face and had to get stitches. Everyone believed me then. Or they’ll ask stupid questions like “you never had a seizure in front of me”  The shift in character (after I got a seizure at work) from my coworkers was so apparent. I felt super supported but also I felt fragile and babied. 

I have yet to meet anyone who can relate. I feel kind of misunderstood and lonely about it. 

Question: Can anyone share their experience with epilepsy and/or a family member/ friend that had it? Can anyone relate??"
387,How to get over ED mindset?,"I just want to start out that I’m a year in recovery and I eat a good amount &amp; I’m never hungry anymore. I have a lot of energy but one thing that is hurting is my mental health. I’ve struggled with anorexia, binge/purge episodes. 

I’ve tried for a long time not to look at my ED body pictures from the past. The problem is, I hate the weight I’m at now. Despite gaining a healthy relationship with food, my hatred for my body grows. I can’t stand seeing the fat on myself. I can’t believe how huge I’ve gotten. I’ve gained 60 pounds. And It really hurts to know that I can definitely get back to my ED body but I know it’s not healthy. I’m happy I’m not longer counting calories and missing out on events because I don’t want to be tempted but...I can’t help but miss it. 

I live with my family now &amp; they make sure I get enough to eat. My ex recently broke up with me because I got too big for him. He knew about my ED and encouraged me to eat. But he changed his mind when he realized gaining weight was a part of it. And that broke me. 

People keep telling me that I’ll find someone who loves me for me. That I’m beautiful irregardless. I just don’t want to hear it. I’m so conflicted. I have strong urges to count calories. When I feel gross, I feel the urge to purge. I no longer binge but I miss the excitement of having mass amounts of foods. 

Can someone give me some tips on how to stop this mindset? To just get over the fact that I’ll no longer have that kind of body?"
388,Why cannot I focus on my duties anymore?,"Context: I am locked due to the virus and I have things from university to study (pre calculus), I started reasonably a month ago but these days I can't do anything, I am over a week doing nothing productive.

I just tried to study but when I start reading my mind starts wandering many things and I get really really tired within a few minutes and when I get to see I understood absolutely nothing of what I read.

I know the environment affects me a lot so I went to the campus yesterday but still nothing, the same happened.

PLUS there is a classmate that intimidates me who is way ahead of me he studies every day and effectively while I am suffering to read a damn line and to understand ridiculously simple math and ALSO my father are far from me thinking I am here ULTRA dedicated and smart, intelligent, glorious and everything, but I am actually incapable of doing the simplest shit, it all makes me want to die, someone help me please 

I still can focus on playing the guitar for an hour straight tho which IS RIDICULOUS, it is just a hobby, I can't make my duties but I can play guitar, WHY?? WHY WHY? seriously, help me"
389,Can something minor cause bipolar?,"I’m so confused about myself. I was fine growing up, a bit mischievous and didn’t have any mental health problems. At about 20 something very minor happened to me. I felt betrayed and vulnerable but it was only something small involving money. I feel really stupid for letting it get to me. Other things were happening aswell such as failing uni (I really didn’t care about this at the time though) and I was madly in love with a girl maybe even obsessed, I don’t think she felt the same. I just remember feeling a bit devastated about the whole money thing for some reason. I don’t know why but it really got to me. I think I started to show signs of a manic episode to that girl which made me lose her and then after my episode I went pretty much mute for months. I felt really down and sad about it. I’m not asking for a diagnosis but can mental health work that way? Be fine one minute then something stressful happen then all of a sudden you have a mental illness?"
390,Feeling like sobbing,"Not only is my period about make a visit, my PTSD is flaring and my heart is breaking for the whole world. It’s just a trifecta of crap hammering at my brain today.

I’ve yelled at my toddler a couple of times today (over stupid stuff) and feel like an awful mom. She’s just being a toddler and I can’t seem to understand that today. I absolutely DO NOT want or think about harming my baby. I’m just feeling overwhelmed today."
391,Do you feel the same way?,"With all of this protesting going on i feel quite weird. I support the BLM movement 1000% but as of recently it just hasn’t been the same. I used to be so involved and active but with my depression, anxiety, and eating disorder I can’t shift my focus on the bigger picture. I feel selfish and guilty but I have to put myself first right? It makes me doubt what I’m even saying because I’m not “putting me first” im still in a dark place. I’m just not used to not feeling so attached and active during this time because even before all of this I was vocal and very supportive. It’s like I don’t even care and I hate myself for it. I want to get better so I can get back to that place."
392,The thought of working 40+ hours for the rest of my life makes me want to end it,"I’m a young adult, I’ve been at my first, real “adult” job for about a year now. And I am exhausted. How can people do this? What is the point of living if you’re just giving all your waking hours to someone else? 

I’m not lazy. I don’t want to be unemployed. But I can not stand the thought of doing the same exact thing every single day for the next 50 years or so. And as a millennial, I’m sure I’ll never be able to retire. I’m literally going to work myself to actual death. 

I can find an amazing position that I love, but I don’t want to spend my time on earth trapped in an office in front of a screen. I don’t want to spend 90% of my waking hours *not* living. 

I’m so mentally drained by the time I get home that all I want to do is eat and go to bed. Even when I force myself to engage in some hobbies or spend time with other people, I’m not all the way there mentally. It’s not enjoyable. I’m tired.

I spend all week just looking forward to the weekend. Not because I have some fun things planned. But because it’s a break from being at work. And then I spend the two days running around doing errands, cleaning, etc, because I don’t have the time or energy to do it during the week. 

Weeks and weeks and weeks pass, and what do I have to show for it? What am I doing with my life. Wasting it. What is the point?

Just typing this, I can’t feel pain in my chest from the anxiety. It makes my stomach hurt. My hands shake. 

I can’t live this way. I’ll never have enough money to work on my own schedule. To do what I actually want to do. To even go on a vacation for more than a weekend. I can’t do it. I can’t."
393,KETAMINE Day 9,"Not gonna lie, been in a slight slump the last couple of days with my first SIs Sunday since I started treatment a week ago but my doctors said it is expected and it means the Ketamine treatment is working its course as planned. The dip in mood during the Ketamine treatment happens after the second and third injection treatments as the brain is trying to reboot. Today I feel a lot better though and have a lot more energy for things like exercise and all the arts that I make as my coping mechanisms. I also feel a little lighter and less depressed than I am at this point in the day after my third injection yesterday. I have my next appointment coming up tomorrow and I'm looking forward to wrapping these up because they make my head hurt everyday. Like a sore, tired brain feeling headache that doesn't go away for a while after these appointments."
394,"I’m indifferent to dying, am I depressed?","I feel like I could die at any moment and it wouldn’t matter for me. 

I’m not particularly sad about anything anymore. I mean, I used to be, but a lot of factors in my life have settled down and now all I’m left with is a sense of apathy. 

Before quarantine, I would work 70+ hour weeks with multiple jobs that were pretty physically demanding. I’m not working these hours to support anyone but myself. My family doesn’t need money. I knew it was taking a toll on my body and I’ve been avoiding any type of medical help. I’m young (22F) and my reasoning for why I’m willing to sacrifice my health and work so many hours is because I don’t care if I die. 

Is this a healthy mindset to have? Is this a form of depression? I don’t really know anymore"
395,My mom is denying me access to mental health care,"I have depression, and I have for multiple years, and I finally just told my mom that I want to get a therapist for it. However, she got very angry at me, and said that therapists are for “rich trendy teens.” What do I do? 15 non binary from Michigan"
396,We Suffer More Than Anyone Else,"I have never posted in this subreddit before but I first had to mention that I first began dealing with this monster at the age of 9. When I first got my panic attack, I was with my family and it felt like a weird moment that would mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. Suddenly a few weeks later I began feeling eery and not my self. It didn’t quite kick in yet, but my terror had just begun. 

Weeks then turned to months which then turned to years.. I was never the same again. I couldn’t explain what it was to my own mom, my doctors, nurses, priests.. I had no idea what it was myself. This was before I had access to the internet like I do nowadays. I tried therapy and everything but it was a silent killer. Little by little my carefree innocent self was gone. It will never return and from 2008-2015/6 I was trapped in a bubble dealing with something I couldn’t even describe. 

I went to therapy from 2013-2016 and yes it did help but I never went in detail about this problem, it was just ‘panic attacks’ and GAD. I had to learn on my own through research what exactly I had. I’m not diagnosed with this and probably never will because the mental health system is far from competent. I know I suffer from anxiety, panic attacks, OCD? maybe.. but this I sure as hell know I lived with and it absorbed me. 

I don’t know if it will ever return, I feel glimpses some days. I felt better after knowing a few years ago that what I’m experiencing isn’t just me and I’m not woken from the matrix or discovered Pandora’s box, or become aware of my existence like Adam after eating the apple. I had the misfortune of having been caught with this specific disorder which is the worst thing imaginable when at its fullest, would not wish it on my worse enemy.

I often wonder how my life would have turned out if I didn’t do that specific thing that 18th of February of 2008. What could have been of me? What if I was distracted a slight millisecond and avoided that thing that cause my misfortune? That 9 year old version of me is out there somewhere, and he’s free from this demon that haunted my very core."
397,I’m curious to see what red flags or hunches you guys can spot from what I am about to say.,"-Long read ahead-

I’ve been having trouble looking for mental help in where I live because other than the lack of universal healthcare and professionals, I have problems with the family-centric and conservative culture in the country that I am in. The general culture, in actuality. I really want to get diagnosed, or just know the things that I need to work on at least but I find it hard to find someone who won’t tell me to pray my problems away or that blood family is the most important thing (it’s really a family-centered society and it also doesn’t help that corporal punishment is something they find laughable and essential) even though I tell them I have problems.

With that, I struggle with my unresolved issues and ones that I don’t know how to address or identify so here I am with a few sentiments to vent out and asking the dear internet of things because I have nowhere else to go and I don’t want to burden people around me.

Okay I’m not sure where to start but I guess I’ll start with the therapist and friend situation.

I have a few friends that I love...and sometimes I want to tell them things, and sometimes I do but I don’t want to overwhelm them because my problems are not their burden, and they already have a lot on their plate. Friends and strangers have been more like family to me than my own but I really struggle with telling them the problems that I have...the weird or creepy problems. And sometimes I feel like I am too much and not enough at the same time. 

On looking for therapists, I used to ask around a bit but the worst encounter was probably my guidance counselor from school. Okay I’m not sure if she counts as a therapist but I remember looking for help when I was failing college. I was overloading and taking subjects in advance because of a deal I had with my parents. I was trying to say that my domestic situation was quite bad and that I just want to stay in school because it’s where I felt safest and probably the place where I first felt home. She said something along the lines of “You’re not loved the way you want but your parents love you. Family is very important. Your parents are your parents. You’ll be like that too when you have kids. When you have problems just pray. I’ll be praying for you.” I have qualms on this and I find it very difficult because I am an atheist and aspiring progressive liberal who lives in a catholic and conservative country."
398,"Hi Reddit. I (24/f) am in a relationship with a guy (25/m) who I believe has a mental health issue, but he won't tell me what it is, and I don't know if I should be concerned.",[deleted]
399,Social Media,"Hey all,

M/27 here. With everything going on in the world right now I’m seriously considering deleting the rest of social media. I already did IG. All I hav left is twitter and Snapchat. If anyone else out there had already deleted theirs/never had any social media, please share with me how it has impacted your mental health. Thanks!"
400,I need some advice on dealing with a roommate of mine that refuses to get help,"Hi, everyone. First time poster (basically actually my first post, every other one was years a go I believe). I'm just gonna jump right into it. About a year a go a friend of mine that had been having some issues at home moved in with myself and my girlfriend. Since then, we've had our ups and downs, but more recently it's only been downhill. For the past three to four months, our roommate/friend has turned to drugs to escape his problem, and in the past two months specifically has almost completely stopped sleeping and eating. He started entering these weird fugue states last week where he literally just doesn't act like we exist and occasionally has  a massive freak out following them. Just the other day, following using drugs as an escape again, he entered one of those fugue states and passed out in the middle of our living room floor, completely unresponsive for five or six minutes (in that time, I had decided and was about to call the hospital, this didn't end up happening until an hour or two later). When he woke up, he ran in a full sprint into the kitchen, through a glass coffee table, shattering it, and then he headbutted the fridge five or six times. I love this dude like a brother, but because of this behavior I'm nearing my breaking point. I'm honestly not sure how much more of this I can handle. Would I be making the right decision if I either helped him find a place to stay (i.e a homeless shelter or possibly a halfway house) or if I kicked him out and had him go back to living with his family? I feel as though I've exhausted every other option available to me at this point."
401,Have you ever thought about killing your self?,"I’ve thought about killing myself, not because I’m sad, and not because I want to die. Because I don’t want to die. I just don’t want to live in this world. There’s things that go on in this world that make me sick. So much evil and cruelty and hate. I can’t take it anymore. I can’t hear anymore negative things, but that’s all there is to this world. My mental health is suffering. I just can’t stop thinking about bad things that have happened and happen every day in this world. Why? Why are people the way they are? How does that happen? I am so sad. Because I want to live, I have plans for my life, there are so many things I want to see and do. But I am sad to even be living in such a world. I’m sick."
402,"If you have a clinical history in mental health, do you feel that the medical community doesn't take you seriously and you're seen through a veil of ""this person is not in their right mind""?","A little bit of context: I'm a 28F and I now suffer from anxiety but I'm otherwise healthy. When I was a teenager, however, I was severely depressed and tried to take my life multiple times. I was wrongly diagnosed with anorexia, because I was malnourished since I would refuse to eat or drink (I didn't want to live). Because I was misdiagnosed with AN, I was put against my will in an ED clinic, force-fed through a feeding tube, tied up against the bed, all that. Doctors didn't believe my reasons, though a therapist did agree with me that my problem was different, that she thought I had depression and was trying to end myself (the reality of my case at the time).

After I was out I asked for help for my depression and started living for the first time. At 20, years later, is when I started considering myself recovered. I wanted to live, I ate, drank enough water, socialized. I was a normal young adult and I was happy to have been given the opportunity of life. I felt alive and amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, things got rocky a couple of years ago (money problems, relationship problems, family problems, etc. all at once) and I started having recurrent anxiety attacks.

Since I've lost a bit of weight (involuntarily) over the past 2 years I mentioned, I decided to start trusting the medical community again and ask for my doctor's help to gain weight. BUT as soon as I entered and closed the door, he said he'd been reading my clinical history in mental health and he was convinced I was starving myself. He said he'd be contacting an eating disorder clinic and he accused me of all sorts of things. He asked me when was the last time I ate. I said right before getting there. He called me a liar and said he was positive I was ""back to having anorexia"" when I never had it in the first place.

Every time I go to the doctor they read my history from over a decade ago and they don't even want to hear me out or ask me questions. They've made up their mind about the ""type of person"" they think I am. My questions, unanswered. My explantions, unheard. He does not believe I have anxiety and have been through hell over the past years. He thinks I'm starving and purging and have a poor body image.

And it's not only this doctor. I haven't seen any doctors at all who have wanted to listen to me or help me since I went through that as a teen.

Is it the same/similar for you?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I went through depression and was suicidal as a teenager, was very mishandled by doctors then, and over 10 years later they still see me through that veil of ""she's crazy"" and won't listen. Wondered if it's someone else's experience."
403,"there really is something wrong with me [rant, TW i guess?]","i got diagnosed with autism and adhd, im still waiting to be medicated, this is slightly important. i cant do this, all my fucking life ive been told im special or that im smart when deep down i know im the stupidest weakest thing to ever exist on this planet, i just cant take it. why was i given these disadvantages what was the point, why cant i be cured, why is my brain like this, why must i tear myself up after a good day, why cant i be normal. all these things are getting to me and i cant take it, im only not taking my life because it will hurt others and there are people i care about (friend, cat, mum). i want a cure, there is none, i feel like im falling into insanity like this, i cant even do a test without being reminded my genetics made me inferior to others, sure i dont have anything severe with my mental health that will permanently ruin my life but i cant even do a mensa pretest by myself without being bothered by all the stimuli around me and then breaking down knowing im just a weak failure. i know that if i did take the iq test i would probably go and cry because of how bad it would be. i really wish i could change or there would be a way for me to fix this, i know anti depressants arent the way for me to go, i just wish there was medication that would make my brain be normal and like others instead of the broken scrap pile my shit dad gave me. like i cant even talk to my parents about this, my mum because she is already extremely stressed and my dad because he is an abusive bitch who made it so now im scared of pretty much seeing anything move unless i know whats happening, my friend could move his fucking hand or his controller and i would quickly cover my head and brace to be hit, thats how bad, its gotten better but all those shit genetic things i cant fucking fix, it makes me want to die, i just wish i could be not me anymore, or i could hit the restart button and maybe this time i wont struggle, but i will, there is no reset, no options, no way out, im trapped, i cant escape, im trapped here and the walls around me are only going to get closer as i try to find a way out of this, i dont know what ill do when it closes in completely but i can hope ive already escaped. when i dont feel like sad i feel null, or nothing, and that nothingness it just exists theres nothing i can do, when i am happy its only in small bits like if someone makes me laugh or im doing something like petting my cat or something or i actually accomplish something ""productive"" in my mums eyes, or if im with a friend, i used to be happy playing games but it just feels like static distractions now, like im just not having fun anymore. also like im going to be like this forever probably, i just have to live with it.

thanks for reading my emotion mess/vent thing i guess. 

also TL;DR : ive got mental issues i was born with and its fucking up my life to the point where i dont want to live"
404,I think i just want someone to listen....,"If anyone wants more details, feel free to ask questions and i'll try my best to answer. 

A heads up, there is a handful of swaring in my short novel of a post because i didnt know how else to word it... so my apologise if thats not allowed here or causes anyone distress.

**Long Post Warning**

I dont even know... i've been debating whether or not to post here for at least a few months now, but every time i go to post i always just feel like im just an attention seeker and by posting id be taking away from others who have it worse than me... but im going to make myself post this... so, here it goes i guess.

I (21M) currently still live with my parents and younger brother (19M almost 20 and low functioning autistic). I have been living with depression for about 3 and a half years now, and i cant say i feel like i have anyone i can actually turn to when i need them. I dont trust either of my parents... my mother has a loose mouth and talks about everything to anyone who will listen, has completely filled this 5 bedroom house with junk and rubbish (hoarding) and blames me for the mess, and also blames me for the ""bad financial situation"" despite the fact my dad earns enough for a family of 4 to live decently. Really, she just cant budget for shit. She also still treats me as an 11 year old.

My dad has always been cold and condescending towards me. Always implying i wasnt good enough, most recently say that im just looking for a free ride in life and im actually just a lazy piece of shit (again, implying those things, never directly saying them but definitively getting the point across). He also still treats me as an 11 year old.

I do have a girlfriend (20F) who is absolutely amazing, who knows how unfun it is to be in this house (my parents also treat her as an 11 year old, and they call us both kids which we have asked them to stop multiple time to no effect so far). She has said i can come to her with anything, and i believe she meant that, but she has her own issues... she has anxiety and is currently studying. Barely coping with the work load would be an improvement to her situation... not to mention the pandemic throwing everything off which made things much harder for her. I listen to her cry from the stress of her workload and her own home environment most days.... i cant add more to her plate when its very clearly over capacity already....

I have just started seeing a psychologist, though i've only had 1 appointment so its a bit too early to tell how thats going. So far she's really lovely, but i cant help but feel everything she said to comfort me in the first appointment is just scripted. Because its her job to do that. Like she doesnt actually care, she just gets paid to do that... i guess time will tell whether or not thats just me being sceptical or not.

Im not really sure why im writing and posting this... i guess i was hoping id find someone who would listen, and maybe have some kind words or something. Idk. It's 5:20am and this has taken me an hour to write out so i better post it before i delete it all.

If you made it through my novel of a post, thank you for taking the fortnight to read it lol."
405,Am I having flashbacks or hallucinations or something else?,"To try to keep this short, I have multiple traumas from childhood followed by a life of escalating stressors that I have started to reduce in the past few years. 

When the pandemic happened, I spiraled into a deeper depression and my anxiety escalated. I started taking Prozac 20mg a little over 2 weeks ago. The depression and anxiety are lifting, but I'm starting to have moments where the world seems kind of fuzzy/blurry and my sense of space and time seem somewhat distorted. This has primarily happened while laying in bed. Two or three times that I've just been laying in bed, I would get a weird blurred vision that reminds me of the effect they try to use in movies when switching between past and present or showing a hallucination or flashback. 

Mentally, it feels like I'm being transported to another time. Then it stops. Except the other day, I used marijuana and had the same effect happen, but I was able to kind of relax into it and see what happens if I don't distract myself from it. I suddenly went through a couple of past emotional states: (1) missing my dad who passed 8 years ago - and I've really not missed him lately as I've been working through some issues there; (2) remembering how I felt when being punished by my parents. I cried and then it was all over and I was back to the present. 

So, I'm not sure if the same thing is trying to happen when I'm sober and I'm just able to block it from happening...and I'm not even sure exactly what is happening. What I am reading about flashbacks makes me doubt this is a flashback for some reason, but it also doesn't fit into hallucinations or delusions.

Does anyone have any insight?"
406,Need someone to talk to,"Hello.
I'm a teen living in Europe. 
I have depression and anxiety. 
The quarantine has caused me to get very depressed and lonely. The things going on now in the US skyrocketed my anxiety. I am in a very bad place trying to keep going and calm myself. I don't have anyone to talk to. I am terrified of everything going on and it's causing me to get very long panic attacks day, in day out. 
Is there anyone i could talk to here..? Just maybe vent a little or get some advice.."
407,I'm struggling to trust my boyfriend since he got OCD,"My boyfriend was always prone to overthinking and developed what we now know is OCD last summer.  Since he first disclosed his intrusive thoughts to me 10 months ago, and has shared a few every few weeks, I feel like I can't trust him. In the last few weeks (probably in response to me having little to think about during this 3 month lockdown) I've been thinking about his various scary thoughts. Mostly it's  about our relationship, whether or not he's secretly bi but some of his intrusive thoughts  are related to the fear of being a pedo. I just can't get over this, the fact he even could doubt that while he's anxious. 

He also confessed past mistakes to me a lot in the early days of his OCD, and I can't get it out of my head, that he read erotic fan fiction and erotic fan art about Lisa Simpson at 13. Granted, she acts a lot older in the show and in most of the stories she was 13 or older, but I can't get it out of my head that this means he is a pedo, as he recalls searching for images of her being 8 once, so she would look like she did in the show. Outside of intrusive thoughts he hates, I have no reason to believe he is one. I'm just so terrified of marrying a pedo as a friend of mine's dad turned out to be one and it tore the family apart. He is sick of me questioning his past mistakes and intrusive thoughts  over and over almost every day and promises constantly he just has OCD and he feels like I'm interrogating him for any sign he is bad when I should just trust him."
408,Please read this post if you are suffering from suicidal ideations -- YOU ARE NOT ALONE!,"Hello,

My name is Joe Massa, I'm a filmmaker and I wanted to share with you all the series that I recently created called *My Suicide Story --* a web-docuseries that features actual survivors of attempted suicide who share their stories with their struggles and ultimate triumph over their respective attempts.

Recently my brother Christian agreed to assist with the series as suicide really hits home for both of us. Together as a team, and as brothers, we are aiming to combat suicide and ultimately save lives by exposing suicidal ideations so that others suffering from similar thoughts know they are not alone.

We are also trying to familiarize non-sufferers with some of the commonalities those suffering from ""SI"" experience/present so that they can recognize these potential signs and attempt to offer help before it's too late.

I wanted to post this here for anyone who might need to hear what these survivors have to say. If you too are being plagued by these tormenting thoughts and don't know how to deal with them, or even what they are, this series may help. Dozens of people have reached out to me from all over the world letting me know how some of these stories have helped them and I just wanted to offer the same to you all.

\*Please do note that the information in this series might be triggering, so... TRIGGER WARNING.\*

409,Black Lives Matter coverage detrimental to my mental health,"I want to warn you before I write this, THIS IS CONTROVERSIAL. I will come off as completely “racist” according to people on social media. I just want to rant.
I’m tired of hearing about riots and looting. I’m tired of this Black Lives Matter bullshit. I’m tired of people saying that if you don’t post on social media about the Black Lives Matter movement, that you’re part of the “oppressor” and “racist”. NO. I am opting out of spreading a traumatic event that is detrimental to my mental health to see and hear about. I need to set this boundary for my sanity. No, I am NOT racist or a fucking oppressor or whatever bullshit uneducated libtards want to label me. I am 100% against racism and am a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. I have black friends and it makes me feel very sad that there are racists out there, and am heartbroken about the fact that slavery and abuse to black people have existed in the first place.I would have gone to a peaceful protest if not for COVID-19.
I am just tired of uneducated people posting cutesty pictures for the ~aesthetic~ and reposting violent and traumatic content out in the open. People don’t understand that violent content is triggering for others to see and doing it over and over again is inconsiderate. ONCE IS ENOUGH. You don’t need to do it multiple times to spread a message. People get what you’re saying by posting it once because all their other followers are spreading the same message too! It is traumatic to see even once, let alone over and over again. Leave people alone. I will say this again. Posting once IS ENOUGH. There is no need to clog up everyone’s feed repeatedly when everyone else is reposting the same content. I know I could log off social media but social media is one of my main coping skills, and you are being inconsiderate to others who have the same coping skill. THANK YOU."
410,I’m InT-p,I didn’t know what that was but that is my personality. And it’s so interesting that is so thru. What are you guys?
411,My sister is cutting and i don’t know how to help,"I saw by accident cuts on my sisters leg and my parents have not seen, and I am very concerned especially considering she had a suicide attempt about two or three years ago. I don’t know how to help or what to say, and I’m not sure if I should tel my parents? I’m 20 so I guess I could talk to her but I don’t know what I would say. My mom has borderline so I don’t really want to tell her, and my dad has been acting like an ass hole recently so I don’t know how much help he would be either, but he’s usually nice though. Anyone have ideas on what I should do?"
412,Anybody else get really depressed on their period?,I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression on and off pretty much my whole life. When I’m on my period I fall into a weird deep depression that my usual exercises and tools can’t really get me out of. Has anyone else experienced this?
413,My moms abuse has finally broken me,"Ok back story: I grew up in a war zone. My dad had to flee because whos life was in danger. He couldn’t bring us because he had no money and we had lost everything.

My mom had an affair and cheated on my dad while he was away. I was too young to understand this was wrong and this man that would be around all the time would try to sexually abuse. My dad saved up enough money and could fly us out to be with him. I eventually brought up the strange man that would sleep over. My mom and dad separated for a few days and my mom started calling me a liar. She started encouraging my siblings it was okay to be mean to me. This started with my little brother who would throw things at me, and I tried to tech him that it was wrong. My mom told him he can do whatever he wants and told my sister it was okay aswell. She would alienate me by taking my siblings on personal outings and giving them personal attention and telling me I don’t deserve that. I thought about telling my father I was being mistreated by my mom and she told me he would scold me for saying that. So being a dumb scared little kid; I didn’t say anything. This is going to be lengthy: I’m sorry but I haven’t talked about this before and I haven’t to get it all out. 

My mom started working a lot and I was happy because she wouldn’t be around to torment me anymore, and I could develop a relationship with my siblings. I started taking cate of them and took over almost all motherly duties. My mom would come home angry because I didn’t clean well enough or cook well enough. I was a child. Maybe 11. I stopped playing outside because I wanted to focus on getting my chores done right. As I teen I started self harming and my mom found it and told me I might aswell kill myself, because I’m not getting attention. She read my diary to my entire family and left me feeling generally lack of trust and insecurity. The whole time my dad isn’t saying anything. She snooped again and found out I was gay. She threatens me and outs me to my family. I ran away and she told manipulates them to think she did nothing wrong. My family moved to America so I thought I was finally free. I refused to go with them and tried to start my new life. She promised I could live in my family home until I get on my feet. 3 days later she informs me she made arrangements for me to live with a family member and have to leave the house immediately. I had no money or support system. The family member I lived with made up lied about me and basically treated me like the help. My mom came to visit me and convinced me to go with her to visit them. She took my legal paperwork and when I got there for what was supposed to be a 2 week visit; she told me I would not be leaving and going to school there. I had no money or support system yet again. I eventually escaped and came back to Canada. She followed me here and I was living with my boyfriend at the time. He cheated on me and lied about paying rent so we got evicted and I went home. Despite me paying her rent I’m constantly locked out of my own home, ridiculed, shamed, privacy stopped and on top of that she tells me to find somewhere else to live constantly. I don’t feel safe eating infront of her because she tried to make me cry during a family dinner and on multiple occasions told me I don’t deserve to eat. I constantly feel worthless. I’ve tried multiple times to leave and get thwarted. I spend most of my time hiding in my room, stealing food and tiptoeing around her. I’m really anxious and quite honest ready to kill myself."
414,What's the difference between being narcissistic/vain/self-centered and being proud of yourself?,"A bit of background, I'm a 20-year-old female and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since I was 14. I have struggled and fought to continue living. I was misdiagnosed when I first started treatment, put on the wrong medicine, and my symptoms got worse. It took a lot of doctors' appointments and therapy to be able to find a good balance for me.

Well, yesterday, my friend and I were talking about another person who struggles with depression/anxiety. The person is in an unhealthy and unhappy relationship and has started medicine to try and help their long term depression. The problem, according to my friend, is the person will start feeling better and stop taking the medicine and then start to feel bad again.

I made a comment about how you can't really do that with medicine and my friend said that when someone is depressed for literal years, they have a higher chance of going off the medicine they're on, which I agreed was true. I then made a comment about how I did that a bit when I started taking medicine.

I told my friend I would miss doses of my medicine because I couldn't see a difference between being on it vs being off it. I reflected on how it took 3 to 5 YEARS to be able to see a difference in my emotional state and stability. My friend commented it takes a lot of patience to get to that point and a lot of people don't have it. I told my friend I had no idea how I did it or why I kept fighting so hard to survive. I said maybe it was my mom being there for me occasionally, or maybe the fear of repercussions of impulsive acts, or maybe I have a fighting spirit, but overall, I was unsure.

My friend said I was strong.

I've been told I'm strong and that the things I've done are a lot for a 20-year-old. The last 6 months of 2019, I was in college part-time, I worked part-time, I hung out with friends, I had a healthy romantic relationship, I was learning and growing as a person, I was recognizing toxic behaviors in my parents and family, and I was paying my own bills all while struggling with anxiety and depression and occasionally suicidal ideation. I've been told by my therapist and doctors and friends that the stuff I have done/gone through is incredible and that most people my age didn't do what I did/do.

What I've been struggling with: Is it okay to be proud of myself for it...? Where is the line between being boastful and bragging and being genuinely proud? I feel guilty and shame when I talk about some of the stuff I've dealt with/done. It feels like I haven't done enough or done anything special even though I have been told otherwise. One of my biggest anxieties is that I'm actually self-centered and selfish. I try my best not to be but I can't help but fear that people who say otherwise are lying to me...? Its a mess and I'm not sure how exactly to phrase it correctly so I hope y'all understand."
415,I am absolutely fed up of trying.,"I have tried to care about stuff people are generally talking about, be through social media or real life (though that doesn't happen through this time). I am sick and tired of people droning on about controversies on the internet and all that, I can't even turn on the tv now everythings gotten that shit in my honest opinion. When I try to socialize it is like I am just being ignored or that nobody is paying attention to what I say. I am tired from the moment i wake up, i sometimes sleep twice a day and still feel like shit, nobody I know irl actually cares enough to talk to me. I left a community I felt welcomed in because sometimes I just feel like that. The problem is now mental health issues seem to be a ""trend"" that its popular to have one which to me seems stupid. I have went through help with multiple professionals and it seems that I just get thrown around to another one just as I feel I am about to make progress in any kind of recovery or help. The thing that annoys me most is when I tell someone suddenly they seem to ""care"" for about 2 days then they just stop caring, and for those 2 days they just turn into a mental health guide book for some reason. I have given up all hope to be honest, mental health just feels like a buzz word now, something people will just forget about after a while. Just seems that a bad time to be living in."
416,My meds making me too normal?,"So I used to be hyper and weird af all the time and then i got diagnosed with extreme social anxiety and depression so I got put on prostiq and now i'm super ""normal"" and chill and I stream on twitch and I feel like I don't get views on twitch because I'm so normal and boring. I honestly miss my old self. Idk has anyone else felt this with pristiq??"
417,I’d love someone to read this and give their opinions.,"Hi there, 

So right now I’m struggling with my thoughts and it’s like I’m fighting with them, I’m making every situation into a horrible thought and making everything that happens in my life, I’m turning it into a what if scenario and it’s making me anxious and paranoid. Can OCD like thoughts and anxiety cause you to feel paranoid about your thoughts? One example is I seen Facebook message on my girlfriends phone and automatically my thoughts went “ you should have asked her who it was, it was probably another guy” and I honestly obsessed about this for hours. At the time it didn’t bother me but after it I started obsessing and makes me feel paranoid. Is this something that anxiety type thoughts can do? Also I have a massive fear of schizophrenia so I’m trying my best to link it to that but I have major insight into it but just my thoughts are horrible and I come up with terrible situations with my thoughts and they cause me anxiety. I always worry what people think of me and I over analyse everything. Anyone else?

Thanks,
Brandon"
418,I don't know how to cope anymore,"I've never felt this way before in my life, I wake up every morning with a heavy feeling in my chest. I can't do anything except from crying and lying in bed, everything seems so pointless, I completely RUINED my life.

Let me start by saying, I'm in a relationship for 6 years now, since high school, never been with ANYONE else except from him, he was the only person I ever kissed. Until, last year, I was desperate for friends at the time and this guy invited me to a party, made me drink alot and basically rape\*d me, but it didn't end there, as I ended up going back to see him, I'm not sure why, guess because he really took something from me and I wanted to normalize the situation? we ended having sex, I don't even know how, during i tried to stop it multiple times,  but he wouldn't listen, I told him I only wanted to hang out. After that I felt so guilty, it took me so long to process what happened. All I wanted was some friends, I didn't want to have sex with him, I have my boyfriend and I always just wanted him, and him being the only person I had sex with was very special for me, and now that's ruined.

Then, I ruined my life further as I was very depressed and said some NASTY things online anonymously to other people, I've been found out and now no one likes me, everybody thinks I'm a freak, and on top of that, that account was linked to something that i wrote to the guy that used me when I was drunk - and I'm scared that for revenge he will ruin me more and tell people how much of a wh\*re I am. I NEVER hated myself more, in my entire existence, I feel ashamed, I feel disgusted, I just want to dissappear. I never felt this much pain before, it really hurts.

What do I do"
419,I'm Scared of My Mental and Physical Health,"hello! uhm i haven't ever posted on reddit, but i need advice or something. anything.

i am a college student renting an apartment with 3 other people. it's split onto two floors, the upstairs having my room and person X's room, and the downstairs being person Y and Z's rooms. however, tensions are so bad and we all get along so poorly that 1 person (X) just basically doesn't live here and 1 person (Y) stays at their partner's house except to visit me for yoga. Y and i are the last friends of the house, as everybody else hates each other. basically, the only person living here besides myself is person Z and we are thankfully separated by stairs.

we are no longer friends (and just recently on speaking terms after being silent for over a month) for reasons that would take a novel to explain. basically, i don't agree with their moral compass whatsoever and they have done things that i personally consider horrific, therefore i don't interact with them and will not once our lease ends in august. tensions have been high since january, our official unfriendship began sometime in march or april. at the beginning of that unfriendship, they would slam doors and cabinets, cause fights with person Y when they were here, and leave strange numbers on the board each day. i found myself feeling less and less safe in my home, but i have nowhere else to really go. i have documented evidence against them and their behavior in case i need it, but i am STRIVING to be left alone and not spoken to. i am attempting to be a pacifist. 

that being said, being near them was so unbearable and they were so rude that i simply avoided going downstairs to the kitchen. i keep all my food in my room to avoid conflict, i even have a mini fridge and my own utensils, but now my diet is suffering terribly. i eat once a day, and when i do eat, it's very little. stuff that doesn't require cooking or a microwave because i am so desperate to avoid this roommate that makes my life a living hell whenever they can. it's gotten to the point where i don't consume much water (because the filter is down there) and whenever i eat, my stomach hurts. i don't sleep well and the bags under my eyes are becoming more and more prominent. i am scared of my health.

however, my supportive partner is out of state for an internship, making communication difficult, especially because their coping mechanism with being in total isolation is working nonstop, making their attention hard to get. i cant confide in person Y because they are preoccupied with work and THEIR partner. i feel like a burden to everybody else. i feel incredibly alone. my mental health and my physical health are suffering, but i keep thinking ""so long as i can get to august""

person Z and i have been able to have a cordial conversation circa yesterday about the protests. i am disappointed in myself that i broke my vow of silence, but they had been cordial to me the day before, and i didn't want to seem petty. i just want to be left alone. i'm terrified that the cycle will restart and they will become hostile and start targeting me again at any second, or if anything in their life goes wrong and they decide to take it out on me simply because i am living there. i do not and never have antagonized this roommate, i swear to god i am just begging to be left alone in peace.

i understand that i may read like an absolute baby. i am a coward and should just go down to the kitchen and deal with my roommate for the sake of my physical health, but i mentally cant take it. i've been in several abusive relationships over my life, platonic, romantic, familial, you name it. at this point i'm just desperate to beat my depression and make progress towards happiness, because i've come so close to tasting it that i want it more than anything else.

just.

&amp;#x200B;

what do i do? i'm terrified and alone. im afraid for my physical health and my mental health. every day feels like a blur and im in limbo. this is my personal hell. any advice would be deeply appreciated. i want to be able to last until august. i move out and into my own apartment on the 4th. if you don't have the patience or time to deal with this post, that's perfectly understandable and okay. i'm sorry."
420,"I love my Mum, but being close to her makes me ill","I love my Mum and I usually really enjoy spending time with her... but she’s also the person who triggers my anxiety and empath tendencies the most.

My relationship with my Mum has been really good for the past 2 years since I moved out, but she was quite emotionally abusive for a while before that. I’m terrified things will go bad again, so I text her everyday and visit her twice a week (even though it triggers my GAD feeling of dread and makes me feel drained afterwards.) 

My Mum shares all her problems, rants, and opinions with me and I absorb all her feelings and take them on as my own (I have done ever since I was little.) But sometimes, we have really nice chats and for the most part I enjoy seeing/texting/calling her...but I still can’t get past the feeling of dread and being overwhelmed before and after I speak to her.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and know how I can reduce my anxiety connected to my Mum? I don’t know why I feel so anxious being in contact with her. How can I stop dreading every interaction with her?

It leaves me in tears trying to think of a solution. I want to find the best routine for how much to see and call/text her, but I always hit a brick wall... I  desperately need someone to tell me what they recommend."
421,Just hear me out,"Hello there I am a 17-year-old boy about to turn 18 in 2 months today I had a big fight at home and it hit me hard today. I am a very secretive person I will go to any length to hide a secret I don't want anyone to know. But this time I can't really keep it secret but I thought I could keep it Anonymous(This is my alt). Ok so the main problem with me would be depression this all started when I was in 9th grade about 4 years ago in 8th grade I was good in studies and what not but comes 9th and I go down like a wheel down a hill. In the first-ever exam in 9th, I failed in Maths and Science and it kept on going for the whole year I was promoted to 10th which is really bad so this was the start of my depression ok so comes 10th. Now 10th is very important where I live after 10th you get to choose three streams Science Commerce and Arts where you can choose whichever you like and go to college with that stream. So 9th being so bad my expectation got lower and lower for 10th and I went in a full depression mode at near the end of the year I stopped eating food my sleep was effectively halved and it didn't help that my grandmother passed away that year. My mental strength deteriorated I started becoming paranoid, anxious and what not. Now I passed 10th relatively well but the paranoia and Anxiousness never went away but I kept this secret cause I didn't want anyone to know this it got worse and worse I keep suppressing my anger I won't show how angry I am even if the person is been an arsehole to me and all of this is still with me to date now I was slowly opening up to one of my friend who I kinda like but she started ignoring me in the last couple of days and then there was todays fight which just broke me I don't know what to do I feel very lonely and I just wanna leave everything and start a new life with someone. I guess there's something that might be good I never ever felt suicidal I guess that's good. But the problem is I still compress my anger which according to some online articles is not very good. I just wrote this essay just to open up I don't really know this sub so I guess suggestions are welcomed. we'll anyhow then thanks for reading sorry for any grammatical errors"
422,How to stop acting out on insecurities at partner? (Borderline personality disorder),"My partner is the most supportive and loving person I know but I have this hell of a disorder called BPD. 
Every time I start to feel insecure about anything about us I act out, usually just basically begging for reassurance over the same things over and over again. I feel so guilty when I return to a baseline mood. 
Sometimes I can kind of sense I’m thinking irrationally but the emotional pain is just too much for me to overlook and just kinda takes over. 
I have no idea what to do. :( I just did it again this morning and I’ve been crying all morning and I feel so gutted and guilty I just want to stop.  It’s like my first impulse, to get that instant validation and response I crave. But then my partner feels bad or emotionally exhausted a lot. 

If anyone has any advice I would really really appreciate it! ! 

I really really want to change my behavior but idk where to start. I want nothing more but to change and be happy and healthy but I feel so stuck."
423,Any advice on ditching unwanted thoughts before they have a chance to turn into unwanted beliefs?,"I'm talking about the kind of thing you know is almost certainly not true, but can't help feeling is true whenever you receive negative reinforcement. Like preventing thoughts along the lines of ""cops are bad"", ""clergy are bad"" or ""politicians are bad"" from turning into ""God is real, and it just wants us to suffer because it's the ultimate evil"". I've been there before and finally got out of it about 2 years ago, but with all the chaos going on right now I think I'm starting to fall back into that line of thought. It hit me for a moment last night and I was horrified that I had forgotten just how scary it is to think and feel that way."
424,Why can't I stop making mountains out of mole hills?,"Hello reddit. I'm needing some advice again. I contacted my GP about my concerns and was told it could be about a month before I can get in for a mental health consultation. My husband has been helping me look through online resources and is trying to sign me up for group therapy. He said he wants to support me on this, but hadn't been through anything like I had and thinks it could be beneficial to speak to others from similar situations. 

As I mentioned in a previous post, I am struggling with random bouts of anger, frustration, and outbursts of uncontrollable sobbing. Lately I'm having a harder time keeping my head on straight. I know I've started lingering on things that shouldn't have a second glance. I mentioned before about not being able to find an off switch for my survival mode. It feels like it's getting worse. I react to the smallest things lately, there are a couple of smells that send my anxiety into fits and I find it hard to stop myself from hyperventilating. 

 My family mentioned in a video call how calm I was when shit hit the fan before, and for me to be reacting so much to such little things now is just me being over dramatic. I don't know what to say to that. I'm scared they are right and I'm just overreacting. 

 I've lost my ability to push things down. I don't trust myself to keep my emotions in check. My old coping mechanisms aren't doing the trick anymore. I need some kind of guidance to get me through the next month or so till I can see a professional. 

I've doubled down on gardening, because being outside has always calmed me down, and my husband got me a ukulele to take up a new skill and distract me while I wait for this global p-word to pass. Other than that, I've just been trying to keep my head down and stay distant just in case my emotions runaway with me. Any suggestions on grounding exercises,  observations that could offer another perspective, anything would boost welcome at this time.

 Thank you for taking the time to read this."
425,Weird thing that happens to me,"Idk how to describe this but I keep forgetting my sense of identity.  I’ll be going about my day, and then suddenly realize that I in fact exist.  I’d describe it like I’m watching a movie and then I realize that I am, in fact, the main character.  A lot of times it feels like I’m jolted back when someone calls me by name.  Is this a normal thing?  I read some stuff about dissociation, but I’ve never experienced serious trauma in my life."
426,Brothers bestfriend,"Okay so, my brothers bestfriend is the same about the same age as me, while my brother is a year older. I've recently come to find out it seems like my brothers friend is battling some sort of depression. 
He doesnt want to get close to people emotionally because he will be the problem in their lives. 
He deflects and jokes to make others happy while he isnt happy himself. 
Lately im seeing more and more that hes getting either drunk, high on weed (which he did before, but now it seems like really excessive), and most recently tried shrooms. 
Now i really care for him, ive grown up with him since we were little kids, hes gone on vacations with us and the most recent vacation was this week. Where he got drunk and made a move on me. (Which obviously complicates things) it wasnt talked about until 3 days later. 
He opened up alittle about how he feels, saying he cant get close to people because quote ""I BURN EVERYTHING I TOUCH""
 on another note I let you in I may not let you get close to me...
He also said ""The thought of me dead with my throat slit open felt relieving to see...
I cannot try anything for a while on the account that I ""can turn my emotions off'
That's what the last person I let in said to me 🙂 "" 

Hes obviously been hurt by someone in the past and i want to help him. He doesnt want any of his friends to know he thinks like this. But i am worried hes a danger to himself. 

So this is whats going on with him from the things i know, and it probably is much worse. 
But im going to share my issue with you all. 

On and off ive had a crush on this guy, but never pursued or even thought about being with him because hes my brothers friend. 
Since what happened at the vacation i cant help but think about him. 
Then he revealed to me the issues hes been battling, hiding his sadness and depression from all his friends. 
He consoled in me about things but once it got serious he changed the subject and started sending silly emojis, and asked if i still used my same snapchat. 
He wanted to lets say, use me as a distraction. 
Which, stupidly, i fed into because im a stupid girl. 

Then he doesnt text me, and i dont hear from in in 2 days.  I am worried about his wellbeing and i dont want any relationship we may or may not have affect how i feel about him, and that i want to help him. 

Today i texted him ""hey, you good?"" 
And he just replies hes at the gym. 
Hes going on like nothing happened. And i dont want to be played for as a fool. I want to just stay out of it. But if anything were to happen and i knew i could have did something i couldnt live with my self. 
I want to push and pry and be their for him. 
But i also dont want to seem like a clingy girl. 
I dont know what do do. And i probably didnt explain any of this in an easy way to understand. So please ask questions and help me."
427,Mental health - mushrooms,"Soo, its been a month since i tried mushrooms for the first time, and i gotta say that it wasnt a good trip at all, but it was death scary.. Its was meh.. kinda stressful, but at the same time I enjoyed it.

Since then, ive been feeling anxious, i already got better and normal and then it came back a lot of anxiety and some of hppd symptoms (like brighter colors, a little bit of snow vision and some floaters, and sometimes things move) and what bothers me the most is that my vision perception is kinda altered, like i feel off.

 My question is.. Is this some after effect of a very strong trip, or i have some stupid ass hppd shit that will take forever to heal?

Ps: Im not a drug addict and i never abused drugs. Only smoked weed sometimes and not that often i use to drink some alcohol and shit"
428,My GP recommended me to read self help books when I told her about my anxiety/depression,Will reading a self help book really help my mental health? I made an appointment with my GP thinking she would refer me to a therapist but she told me to read a self help book and to go for walks every day for 30 mins etc instead. Also is it normal for my GP to ask why I feel a certain way and the cause of my depression/anxiety? I thought it’s something I’d tell a therapist so I didn’t feel as comfortable telling her everything and it’s a pretty touchy topic for me. I told her a bit of my problems since she asked and she just told me depression/anxiety is from genetics and told me it’s normal in Asian households etc. :/

435,How to deal with a parent with several undiagnosed mental disorders?,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I have never posted in this particular subreddit before, but I am 30 M with Borderline Personality Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder (possible undiagnosed attention disorder as well). I've earned these diagnoses from a lifetime of trauma and neglect, mostly from my mentally  and emotionally unwell parents.

My dad had GAD and MDD for years before he eventually met his fate from ALS (Lou Gherig's Disease), but he was diagnosed and on medication and therapy. My mother, however, to my knowledge, has never seen a mental health specialist for herself. The only therapy she has been to was ""Couple's Communication"" with my stepdad, which lasted four weeks. 

The entire immediate family knows my mom suffers from a multitude of things, least of all being anxiety, depression, an attention disorder, and mania that manifests into countless expensive and unfinished projects (fixer-upper house, RV after RV after RV, etc). She has vehemently refused to acknowledge that she has mental health issues, and always jokes she ""should"" see a therapist, but never does.

Unfortunately, a year ago I was divorced and the closest family that could help me was my mom and stepdad. Since then I have been doing extensive psychotherapy as well as a balanced medication regimen, but it seems like my progress frequently halts and/or backslides by trying to work on my issues while living with the parent that helped ferment the issues in the first place, as well as growing into more of a stable adult than she is.

Right now my focus is on mitigating my reactions to situations out of my control. For example, she frequently diverts her attention outside of the window at any micro-sign of movement (like a dog), and I had to restart a benign conversation three times. It frustrated me, I voiced my concern as such, and my mom's reaction was to exaggeratedly widen her eyes and focus them on me, as if to say ""FINE, I'm LOOKING at you now, HAPPY?"".

Any advice would be welcome. Asking her to seek help is a moot point at this...point. Just want to know how to deal with it in the meantime while I look for a job to save to move out."
436,I'm trapped and I need some advice,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the right place to share this, because I feel like I can't tell this to anyone around me as no one believes me.

I'm 23 and currently living with my parents because I lost my job due to the coronavirus. It's hell and I feel trapped. My mother is extremely manipulative, she has been like that her whole life, but now it's getting worse. This may sound stupid, but every morning she listens to the radio and I'm very sensitive to sound (loud noise makes it feel like a sword is piercing my ears), so when I ask her to please turn down the volume because my head hurts, she starts treating me like trash, telling me that I make her feel like everyone would be better off without her (which makes no sense, as I only tell her that the radio is too noisy). She then proceeds to break things ""accidentally"" and when someone calls, she only talks shitty stuff about me and my dad"" (who's done nothing). For this reason, everyone thinks my dad and I are terrible people, so when I try to talk to a family member about it, they don't listen to me, and when they do, they tell me ""she's like that, you have to learn to live with that"". My mother is always saying negative things about everyone, and when I tell her I'm not interested in that type of conversation, she insults me telling me I'm ungrateful or the equivalent of a mf in my language (or things like ""you don't wanna listen to me!""). She has made it really hard for me to keep my friends close too, she's the kind of mother who tells you ""A woman's best friend is always their mother"" and ""people are mean, your mother is the only one who will never fail you"" , so it has taken me a lot of time to  trust other people or have healthy romantic relationships. Even though I can't see that's f\* up, I still find myself thinking other people don't like me and have bad intentions.   Sorry, but I need to tell everything she has ever done to me, because I don't know whom else to tell it. She has physically hurt me in the past : pulling my hair, hitting me, she even hit me with a knife once, and she also has done that in front of other people, like it's funny, and she has threatened me with killing herself because of MY actions. I've never done everything that could cause her harm and I've never been disrespectful; I'm not saying I'm a perfect person, but I've been a good daughter, but she still makes me feel like I'm a terrible person when SHE does terrible things. Really, She can insult me for saying my dad's a good man, and I'd feel guilty, even though I've only said ""my dad's a good man"". Probably, if she hits me again, I will think that it's been my mistake and that I deserve it, but deep down, I know that's abuse and that I'm not the one who's done wrong . It's messing up with my head. How can I feel guilty for something someone else has done? It's not normal, not right, to be constantly thinking she might kill herself because I told her how I felt or because I disagree with something.  I'm scared and I feel trapped, I have no where to go, and I don't know If I can keep on living like this. Any advice on how to hold on for a few more weeks?"
437,Does anyone else not deal with that much stress but still feel very stress for some reason?,"I don’t have a job or anything. That may be why. I probably should have one. But when most of my day consists of lounging around, what can cause someone like this to feel so stressed?"
438,Where do you look for hope when there's no hope left?,"People always tell me not to lose hope, but most days every attempt to escape this hell that I'm living inside my head feels useless. Sometimes I imagine everything going how i want, getting everything I want, but nothing's enough to get any hope of anything going better, ever. 

It's like seeing the end of the tunnel, and seeing what's outside of it. But all of that just leaves me with a question: ""and then what?"". Everything feels hopeless.

The people who experience the same, what do you do to ""not lose hope""?"

440,I Want to Connect With Other People But Freeze When They Say Something,"I am in a really weird point in my life. I am realizing that I haven't really done anything or created anything. Everything I have is owned by my parents and I have paid for people to teach me so my educational achievements don't really feel as valid. I am beginning to realizing that I think my dissatisfaction lies in the fact that I am lonely. I am very charismatic but I have never really made super deep connections with other people. Every once in awhile I'll reach out to other people and try and foster a relationship, but as soon as they respond I see the message and think, ""oh I don't want to respond to that right now, it seems like a lot of work"". I guess relationships to me have always kinda felt like work. But when I do finally facetime someone I love the conversation and I get lost talking for hours.

441,I am 17 and I have no friends,"Hi 

I’m 17 and I have zero friends. It wasn’t always like that. As a child, I used to have a lot of friends. I played on the playground, I did wushu, I had many fellas in school. You know, being a child is priceless. You don’t pay attention to peoples’ flaws. Children are kind and innocent. They just are. Not all of them tho but I had that company. Not for a long time tho. 

It all changed at the age of 12. When I quit doing wushu and stopped playing on the playground because my so-called friend said I had acne.  It hurt me. And I had acne and I’m still struggling. 

From the age 12 to age 15 I still had a few friends but they all left me one by one and I don’t know why. Maybe they had found something in other people that they couldn’t find in me. I think I had my head in the clouds. I was thinking about studying abroad and learning English. While one of my friends was into cars and alcohol, one left me because she started dating. That’s how I lost everyone. 

From the age 15 to 16 I had no one. Not even a single friend except for my online friends and I am so thankful to them, they saved me from sadness. I used to talk to lots of foreigners and elders. They would tell me funny stories and help me with my English. I still talk to my internet fellas. I have friends from Jamaica, Ukraine, Belarus, and other countries. They are great. Even thou we might never meet, I don’t care, I love them. 

So, when I was 16 I went dancing classes, and there I met one girl who studied at my school but she was one year older than me. Very soon we became best friends. I would say I was in a bad company. I started drinking alcohol( but I never got drunk to death) I controlled it and my parents didn’t know I drank beer or other things like that. I started smoking but I didn’t have an addiction, I could give it up any time. I was the happiest person on earth because I had been being lonely for a year and then I met her( a cool kid). But then she changed. 

She was calling me ugly and abusing me. She was somebody else and I knew why. She started doing drugs, I couldn't handle this attitude towards me. And I left her, I didn’t care about her because I had had enough.  

The interesting part of this is that during that time when we were friends, she met a lot of new people while I couldn’t do it, people talked to me but it was all. No further communicating. 

Then she finally texted me apologising and I forgave her but our friendship didn’t last long, we stopped talking again. 

So, now I am 17 years old and I have no friends. 

I don’t know why people avoid me. I am trying to be nice and ask them questions, they just don’t care, they all already have they our companies and don’t wanna have another friend.  

I have graduated from school a week ago and I am planning to get to university. This is my only hope. If I don’t find any friends there, I will be really desperate. I hope my future friends will always support me and never bully. I hope that alcohol and cigarettes won’t be the things that will unite us.

442,Help him guys. This subreddit doesn't have enough members. You could help this guy so the crosspost.,
443,I think I might go mute.,"Whenever I think of something it sounds good, but when I physically say it it just comes out sounding wrong and it makes people look down on me, and for the longest time I wish they'd be able to understand what I actually think. I feel like if I went mute maybe they'd understand me a bit more.

I'm also sick of people being mad at me and judging me, I have no filter so I don't think before I speak, and that means I end up saying a lot of stupid things that i end up trying to rephrase right after I say them. I get a lot of weird looks and such because of stuff like that.

My social anxiety is also another reason. I try and speak but I end up hating myself after every sentence I speak, and criticizing myself about every little detail. Small little incidents like me calling out someones name but then realizing it wasnt them haunts me when I try to speak.

I have a lisp due to braces, which makes people mishear me all the time and I get so frustrated because, to me, I am saying them as clearly as possible. Its also one of my insecurities.

I always found writing easier to get my true thoughts out and what I actually mean too. Words just seem to flow easily that way.

(I don't know if the purpose of the post was to organize my thoughts or to find peoples opinions about it, but I'm glad i've done this.)"
444,what type of message would you want from a friend if you were depressed?,"A friend of mine seems to be going through a rough time, has ghosted/stopped messaging me a lot just sent me two saying she's distancing herself from people and that she has her moments in life

I haven't overwhelmed her with messages at very most one a week. Been 3 weeks since I've sent her one just wondering ideas what to send or what messages people who have ghosted others would want them to be sent

Just after some ideas, thank you"
445,I tried to do something good and feel worse.,"I thought it would make me feel good to go for a walk and pick up the trash other people have left behind.

I feel so depressed after seeing what people are capable of. The more I realise how awful humans are, the more I want to stay in and never interact with anyone.

Haven't felt this low in a long time."
446,Just tired of this life,"14 (F). 2020 has been the worst year of my life so far, so much shit has happened. Through the start of the year I was having massive trouble with school, failing everything, fake friends, shy, anti social and just overall stressed out. I felt like every day was a challenge and I really felt like I was stuck in a place where I could never be happy. School also gave me suicidal thoughts about once every 2 weeks.

Throughout that I had only 1 person who actually helped me but he was online so it was difficult since I couldn’t be there with him but he felt like the only real person in my life. Anyway time goes on this new virus ‘corona virus’ happens and it didn’t really affect me at first tbh it benefited me because i didn’t have to cope with the stress of having to go to school anymore.

Anyway the UK is now the second country in the world to have the most deaths and that’s pretty scary and overwhelming if you think about it. I struggle with mental health issues e.g. anxiety, depression so not being able to go out that much really took its turn on me.

The person who I thought was the realest and was my favourite well he left. Hes gone. He left me. Fake people everywhere so now I can’t even trust people anymore great. Definitely not looking forward to going back to school. Probably gonna have more suicidal thoughts again.

I feel like nothing is gonna be okay and everything is getting worse"
447,Some thoughts,"I've been feeling very anxious for the past week, for no reason at all. My heart rate is faster than usual and I've been having trouble with concentrating. I usually try to escape reality by daydreaming, and that works perfectly, but now I can't even daydream because I can't relax at all.

I've also been feeling very, very lonely. I don't even know why. Why do I suddenly crave for human attention? I always have a big urge to check my messenger, to see if anyone has messaged me. I've been constantly checking who's active on messenger, as well, to see if my crush is active (when I see his profile picture pop up in the ""active"" tab, it makes me smile haha), but sadly he hasn't been active at all for the whole month. He used to text me first way more than now. I'm so sad, I wonder if I did something wrong. Yes, we do text, but not as often as 2 months ago. I'm so worried. I wish that I could just stop time, so that I could relax, that I could think about my decisions and what I need to do.

Sorry for bothering you all haha"
448,"PLEASE HELP i keep creating awful imaginary scinareos In my head that always end with me either self harming myself or violently smashing the first thing I see (both in real life), and it's driving me insane","I have a few mental disorders, I never visited a therapist or a mental doctor to get diagnosed because my parents just don't believe I have anything and that it's just puberty

My disorders are : borderline personality disorder, social anxiety , OCD and maladptive daydreaming, I know I have theme all because I have all the symptoms

But now to the issue :

I can't remember when it started, it goes like this : i start imagining a scinareo (mostly in school ), there's always a crowd of other people watching, I'd sometimes be having an argument with someone about something that really angers me (mostly homohobia ) and I'd be really angry and it would end with me having a mental breakdown in front of everyone, and while I'm imaging this I'd be physically saying and doing the things that I'm saying in my imagination in real life, and  when I get angry enough  i just throw something cheap that's close to me violently, and if there isn't anything or if I'm way to angry then I'd start hitting myself really hard for a few seconds, and I always have the urge to take a knife or scissors and stab myself in the neck...

I subconsciously start doing this dozens of times a day, sometimes it's even in public, but lately it's been getting too intense, 

I can't count how many pencils I angerliey bit in half, or how many papers I ripped or how many times I've hit my foot against a wall becuse I'm having a dozen imaginary mental 
breakdowns



I just Can't do anything anymore, my mind won't shut up

I don't wanna go to a doctor, I live in a homophobic Country and I really don't wanna open up to anyone, besides it's not like I can go anyway because of my parents 

I'm really scared that I might finally just pick up those scissors and just make my mind quite... Forever... And that might just happen at any moment"
449,"My boyfriend is going into a mental hospital, what do I do now?","So my boyfriend and I have been dating since August and he has been diagnosed with depression in September/October. He has had a therapist before so for a while nothing much changed. However the more time passed the more often he got into episodes where he got very angry and hopeless. Recently this has morphed into a constant state of hopelessness and apathy.  
He has told me that the depression is now also effecting the way he sees our relationship and his feelings for me. He feels that all of his emotions are subdued so he also doesn't love me the way he did before and he worries that he will leave me or hurt me even though he does still love me - just not as much as before.  
He will be going into a mental hospital in two weeks, where I might not get to visit him yet because of the virus. The average stay is about 6-8 weeks which would mean he'd be out in August. If the pandemic will allow it, I'd be leaving to study abroad in September.

Our situation obviously doesn't seem very hopeful right now and I'm wondering what I'm supposed to do right now. Wait until August for him to find out whether he still loves me or not? Break up with him even though I still love him? Would that be for his own good or would it make everything worse?

I know no one can really tell me what I have to do here.. But maybe you have been in a similar situation and can give some insights? Thoughts? I'm just feeling so lost and helpless right now"
450,How can I draw more positivity into my life?,"I just spent couple of years being a very negative, trying to be edgy teenager. But now I started having depressive and sometimes even self-harm thoughts.  I realised now, how much I damaged myself and how terrible has my relationship with myself went. I just need an advice how to feel positive again, how to feel worthy and love myself again."
451,"I've started to get the same depressed feelings that I had a few years ago, I can't go trough something like that again since I start high school next semester and with that my studies will be severly damaged."," The first six years in my life were as good as you can imagine, had two loving parents, lived in a big villa, had 3 siblings to play with and there wasn't a worry in the world. When I turned six my parents broke up and I had to deal with constant shitalking about the other parent from both of them since I lived every second week at each of them, and even worse soon after the breakup my oldest sister got diagnosed with autism and got detained by child protective services. Since I was so young I didn't really think to much about the problems in my life but as time went on my parents even asked me to try to get information out the other parent so they could use that in court, and I got more and more confused on who was right or wrong, eventually I got depression when I was about twelve years old because everything was just to much and I was on my own. And only really only had one person to that really only cared about me and that was my brother but he moved out when he was 18 because he was done with all the bullsh\*t going on. So now Im all on my own and has broken contact with most friends and feel like Im all alone and just want to escape all this and leave it behind like my brother did, or even better go back when my parents gave me love and compassion. I'm worried I will go back to depression since I'm already dealing with anxiety and I have started to get thoose feelings of hopelessness again, is there a way of reversing this? I can't do much to improve the situation since I'm still a minor and my parents wont do much to help"
452,"I have a legitimate question, I'm confused","I'm having this issue lately where human voices are making my physically repulsed. Like, they haven't said anything wrong I just cannot stand people speaking to me?? It's not me just being all ""ew I hate you don't talk"", it's like an instinctual fight/flight from literally just hearing voices right now. It's only been happening the past couple days and I first noticed it with my grandparents(whom I live with instead of real parents), and then with my match instructor. I found I couldn't even listen to his instructions and teaching without physically wanting to leave. My grandparents are constantly coming and going to my room to tell me how unproductive I am, and yeah it's true, but lately I can hardly listen to what they're actually saying because I can't stand their voices.

I legitimately want an explanation, hopefully someone knows what's going on. I'm bewildered and honestly just had to post and ask about this."
453,How to deal with stress and anticipatory grieving?,"I have a very stressful life currently. My gave birth 2 months ago, in the middle of the quarantine. It was a shaky pregnancy where I constantly got bad news and was placed on bed rest, but my baby is healthy! My mother has bipolar disorder (official diagnosis and she has been involuntarily institutionalized before) and the quarantine has her close to relapse, since she can't see her family or go to church. Due to this, she relies on me a lot more. Her being bipolar affects her so much she can't hold a job or drive, in her case. My dad has stage IV colon cancer since 2016 and right after my baby was born, he got some bad news that the current chemo isn't working anymore and cancer is progressing fast. He's sort of been mom and dad for me, due to mom not fully being able to be there for me. I've been living in turmoil since 2016, but it's gotten worse now. 

I have tried therapy but I don't feel it helps in any way because mostly my therapists seem overwhelmed and don't know what to say. It feels like I'm paying someone $100 to have them listen to me. My current therapist is almost ready to give me the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, after a few more sessions. Have meds helped you cope with grief and too many things piled on? I am scared I won't be able to properly care for my baby if I'm on meds."
454,TW // mentions of sexual assault,"i’m so sorry if this isn’t the right sub for this, but i don’t know where else to go. long story short; i think i was sexually assaulted by my dad. i remember him pulling me into a room, locking the door, and kissing me. when i left i told my mum, and he was really upset at me. the problem is, i don’t know if this happened, or if i’m just making it all up. we recently learnt about reconstructing memory in psychology, and i’m scared that that’s what i’m doing. i don’t know who to ask about it, i don’t know if it happened. if it did it would explain a lot on my life, including me identifying as asexual for almost 3 years. i need to know what happened but i can’t remember, the most solid part in my mind is him getting mad after i told my mum. i would have been around 7-8 when it happened. also if it did happen; would it classify as sexual assault at all? i’m sorry i’m just so scared and confused. i need to know what happened otherwise i can’t move on"

My friend was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Personality Disorder and has been declined sessions from therapists she reached out to and she doesn't know where else to search for help. I've tried searching in Google, but I don't really speak German, or maybe I'm writing the wrong stuff, I don't know but it shows only articles in English about BPD. If anyone knows anything please tell me, I want to help her however I can...



EDIT: I forgot to mention, she has suicidal thoughts and anxiety, but she claims that due the BPD she gets declined help by therapists."
456,I’m a scumbag in my own mind and I can’t take it anymore,"I just want to find a way to remove all the nasty, disgusting, terrible things from the world. I just want to make everything better, and because I can’t, I feel like a piece of garbage. I can’t fix it, therefore I’m worthless."
457,I don't understand my mind and I feel like I'm overplaying,"I'm a 18 gay boy and I experienced lack of emotions for 4-5 weeks in the end of March. I felt nothing for 3-4 days and then for 1-2 day I was feeling super aggressive, extremely sensible and sad and it did ""waves"" like that 5-6 times because I really don't like my parents and I was forced to stay with them at home for 2 month and half now.
My parents are nice but they think they are the most accepting people with LGBT+ but they told gay couple, marriage and families were not ""real one"", they manifested already against gay marriage and they are Christian and I hate most of them.

I called a psy and had an appointment to help me controll those emotions, I'll see her again soon.

Now I still have lack of emotions but those ""waves"" are still there but are weaker and much more shorter (12-24 h) and I feel like I overplayed all, that I lied to myslef and that I complained too much for nothing, especially when I see I'm gay, yes, but I have the advantage of being rich, white, a man, cisgender, never sexually assaulted, in an accepting country, in a family that will just disagree with me being married but will never kick me out.

I hate admitting it but I almost want to live sufferings like being insulted in the street or something so I can give my self the ""right"" to complain and I hate that idea. I find this extremely disrespectful to the people that really experienced those suffering and I hate myslef for hoping that.

I'm lost and I don't understand what's going on, every minute I'm comparing myself to everyone else to compare my sufferings and my life and torturing myself to know if I really deserve to see a psy.
I don't recognise myslef, I never did that before and I feel like I'm one of those stupid people that want to be listened and saying bs like ""anti-white racism exist"" and I don't want to be like that.
I don't know what to do anymore, I hate myself and my stupid thoughts.

Excuse my bad English please, I'm not a native."
458,I’m in fear of the outcome?,"I’m starting to think I am one. I’m going to see a therapist for my ocd. But honestly I don’t even know if I have that and if I do it’s more self centered than I thought? 

I keep thinking I’m a narcissist or a sociopath... at first it worried me and I was anxious. But was I really? Now I’m so worked up I don’t feel anything

Past week I’ve been so worked up, I try to be as honest as possible, I try to be true and not or be manipulative. I’ve taking responsibilities for my actions all of a sudden because I’m paranoid. I’ve confessed the absolute worst things I’ve done to my mom this week. I told all the truths and I keep doing it. I keep worrying I’m not empathic anymore and if my response was true or not 

I look back on so much and I can’t remember if I feel empathy for anything I’ve done or if I’m guilty because of what it does to my image.
All my memories replay. I can’t function I can’t do anything. My mind is so fleeting I stop talking mid sentence because I am focused on my past and fearful of the future.

I’m worried of the outcome of all this and I fear that if I am this. I have no options but to bite the bullet. 

Only reason I keep going is cause I don’t want to freak my girlfriend out. I’ve thought of leaving her if I have either one of these conditions as I feel it’s the right thing to do. 

My emotions feel mute. I’m confused. I don’t know who I am anymore. I can barley function and I’ll i do think of this. Nothing’s gotten better. I keep talking to people and it’s only making me worse 

Can anyone relate? I’m not looking for empathy, just wanna know what’s going on in my head. 
Am I denial ? What’s going on, please help"
459,How do I cope with not having a family?,"My family doesn't like being around me because everyone has put me through some sort of messed up situation at some point. My entire family is in denial about everything to the extent of demonizing me. I (25m) am the youngest in my family and as a result was never spoken to about these situations like my older sisters were. I am basically used for a punching bag for my family to blame for all their shortcomings. My friends who I would to treat as family also use me for a punching bag now that we have lost connection.

How do I cope with not having family or friends in my life?"
460,My social anxiety and fears,"Hi. 
Just to make it clear, I have not been diagnosed  with any mental illness (yet). I plan on going to a psychiatrist in the near future, but I don't feel ready yet. 
So... I usually go and chill in the central park of our town, where a lot of teenagers of my age and older go. I haven't been there for a couple months now(excluding the lockdown) because I am very anxious and scared when others look at me or walk past me. I have a very big fear that they are judging me and making fun of me without me knowing. I don't want to go there or anywhere anymore because I don't want to be seen by others. I am scared. I usually am most anxious when I have to walk past girls my age because I know how ugly and disgusting I am. When I have to stay near them I imagine the worst and the voices in my head are telling me thingsake me think that they don't want me to be there. Tomorrow I'm going to school and I'm very scared of not doing a good job, and that others will laugh at me for being so dumb. 
I am 14 yrs old and I've been like this for around 7 months now. Please someone tell me what to do."
461,Absolutely zero sex drive (TW genital and meds talk),"Hi, I am going to apologise now, as this is part rant and part asking for advice.


Last year, after a hospital admission, I was placed on Anti-psychotics.
Well, they work! I am no longer hallucinating, and my moods have even started to stabilise, which is amazing.

However, I have zero sex drive. Nothing. Nada. Zilch!
It's like that part of my brain has now been completely removed, and I have tried everything I can think of to get it back.

I have a partner who has been absolutely amazingly supportive, but I am obviously terrified that this is going to break us.

I spoke to my Dr's about it and they said either it's something I just live with, or I stop the anti-psychotics and see what happens. No other options.

Now, here's where it gets even weirder...
I am starting to absolutely hate the existence of my vagina. Like the thought of it now repels me. I never had this before, before it was just a part of my body, we were chill. But now, I fucking hate it.
I don't know if I am imagining it or not, but it feels like it's diseased or something, it doesn't hurt or anything, but I don't want it there, I feel like it's got bad vibes and I want to be away from it (I know I probably sound absolutely insane here, and I am so sorry).

I just wanted to ask if anyone else has had these quite intense side effects from meds before, what did you do?

Thank you for reading

TLDR: My sex drive died when I started taking anti-psychotics and now I hate my vagina and think it's diseased or something"
462,Guilty depression due to bullying about family wealth,"I attended a high school with peers that did not have the same background as me. This led to bullying about my privilege. It has led to constant guilt of all the opportunities I have been given, and leading me to not take advantage of them. I know they just had frustrations due to inequality. But those words still stick. Anyone else experience this? How can I look past it and live my life. After all, I am not the most privileged person in the world"
463,Just Got a Restraining Order Against Mom,"Hey guys, first time poster here (and new account for obvious reasons).

My mom has completely lost herself in delusions of persecution, grandeur, etc. and has become rather violent, terrifying, angry, etc. Well, we kicked her out and now got restraining orders. She has always been an addict, stealing medications, doing illegal drugs, and more. She has become a new person, a scary person. We simply couldn't deal with it, which my other mom feels super guilty about - she feels as though she betrayed her at her most vulnerable time, but she said that the kids always come first. My brothers are doing okay, surprisingly okay, but they've never been ones to talk about mental health or when they struggle. 

My other mom is seriously having a hard time with this - she just lost her wife of 25 years and is grieving tremendously. How do I help support her in this time? Any advice, ideas, anything would be greatly appreciated."
464,I need a mental break,"Title says exactly what I need. I’m 23F and I, along with many of you, have had a lot of things happen in my life so far and mostly, I can deal with it pretty well. I’ve been sad, got happy, but then out of nowhere last week, I’ve been the saddest I’ve ever been in my life due to recent events on my personal life, events going on in the world, post-binge sadness, and more. I also work in EMS and the past couple months have been so rough. I talked to m supervisor today about if mental leave from work was a thing because if I’m not even taking care of myself, how can I take care of a patient. I don’t have the right mentality right now. But basically, FMLA doesn’t cover part time employees (I’m part time but I work 40+ hours usually week) therefore, I can’t take time off work and keep income coming to support myself. He gave me the rest of the week off, however, so I’m hoping I can get a grip on myself before next week. Ughh. Thanks for letting me vent Reddit ✌🏻"
465,Intrusive thoughts,"I’m not sure that what I’m experiencing can really be classed as intrusive thoughts - that seems like a big and formal title - but it’s the best way I can describe it. 

I’ve flirted with anxiety, depression and eating disorders for a long time. Right now the depression is on top, anxiety is moderate and ED thoughts are ever present but behaviours are not severe. 

I get these thoughts/images/ideas popping into my head about ways to seriously injure myself. I’ve never done anything like that and I don’t think I will, but it’s getting more frequent and harder to control and I worry that one day I’ll just do it. I’m getting closer to it. Just to see what happens. I play out whole scenarios in my head. It started with one thought a few weeks ago, but now there are 4 that are very recurring and I could do them easily at any time. 

How can I firstly stop myself taking any action and secondly stop the thoughts being so obsessive and uncontrollable?"
466,Y’all I just need some reassurance right now,"Had a suicidal breakdown 10 days or so ago and I’ve made progress but the littlest thing sets it off, I feel it coming again. I’m so scared to go to work or anything, please just tell me it’s gonna be okay"
467,Is it necessary to tell my girlfriend about my mental health,"For some background, I was institutionalised in my early teens for severe anxiety and mild depression. It was more so that the doctors could monitor me while I tried adult medication ( I was tall for my age and the child medication had little to no affect) I was only in the ward for two months .  I still have anxiety to this day but I’m medicated. 

In February I (18m)started going out with my gf (19f), we are both living at our parents houses during quarantine but are doing frequent calls and chatting on social media.

My anxiety is telling me that I need to tell her as she doesn’t know anything about my mental health but my brain is telling me that it’s in the past. I do have anxiety still but it’s nowhere near as bad as it was. 
What I’m trying to ask is, is telling my gf about my mental health a must or knowing that it’s not too bad recently is it a secret that I’m able to have in an honest relationship?"
468,I don't know what's wrong with me,"It is so hard to not know what is going wrong in your head. I have an undiagnosed disassociation issue, and I have had for all of my life that I can remember. It's like I have this mental block, like the feelings are there but they don't connect. 

My best analogies: it's like I'm living in black and white, and the lights are on but noones home. I am slowly, slowly drowning and completely losing my concept of self. 

I want so badly to be medicated, but many docs are hesitant and I don't even know what to ask for. No type of therapy has ever begun to make a difference.

I do not know what to do."
469,Why do I love hurting/manipulating people? Wasn't too sure on if I should post this here or on the mentalillness page.( Long text ahead),"What is wrong with me? I notice that as I've gotten older, leaving people and manipulating them has become my daily thing to do. I truly enjoy hurting others and it makes me feel like I'm powerful. Am I an altruistic narcissist or is my ""martyr"" complex taking in account for this? I always find myself entering codependent relationships rather it be platonic or romantic but I don't feel as if I'm being stressed out as much. I take them depending on me and needing me-to install a false sense of security and safety. I tell them what they want to hear and I make them feel more as if they can't live without me. It's like they become a vulnerable child while talking to a stranger- letting that person know every piece of valuable information about them. After a while I end up leaving- disappearing from their life. Just knowing that they're hurt and cry to themselves over me makes me smile. I know that they do these things because they say things like ""I need you. I'll be broken without you."" And it shows in every gender/age group I date. I don't think that I'm an emotional person or atleast had the time to finish emotionally reconnect/mature in myself. I see patterns in people( I know how they act and what they'll say) just by noticing their movements or the way they switch in texting. I believe people take my silence as a sign of compassion. My therapist has never diagnosed me with an illness relating to narcissism or similar things. I've been abused in many ways growing up as a child rather it be at home or bullying at school, being groomed by older people and so on. Is this just me ""protecting"" this inner child and being stoic? I'm not eighteen yet but I will be in a month and a half. I just really need to figure out the cause behind my behaviors. I feel like my therapist doesn't take anything into account but recently, they did tell me that I had adhd since I was a child and I never knew that. I feel like there's other things I don't know. I have other illnesses that I won't list here because I feel like it doesn't matter in this case. People have also told me that I act very weird and strange. I don't notice these things until people point them out. My voice is very deep and flat and whenever I feel an emotion, my body doesn't display those things. But it's not like I feel trapped. Sometimes people would ask me if I'm okay because I'll just sit quiet and stare for a very long time and I don't know what they're getting at. I get called creepy countless of times. I'm a very dominant and domineering person as well. I dress myself nice, I always smell good. I have good grades and people envy that. I also know that I have a masculine persona and that doesn't correspond to my birth gender: being a female. I think that if I'm not a narcissist-then I must be some type of sadist with a large ego."
470,Do I have depression?,"I'm 16 (M) 

So my mental health hasn't been the best for a couple of years. I've had suicidal thoughts, self harm urges, body image issues, self deprecating thoughts, insecurities, social anxiety and self destructive behaviour, this is all normal for me. 

However recently I've noticed some physical issues. I've been shaking consistently for no reason and I feel sick and for the past 6 days I've been really tired and drained of energy.
I've also been feeling empty/numb for a lot of the day.

However this numbness and emptiness isn't constant. It's probably about 90% of the day. 10% of the day I feel fine, apart from ofc the thoughts. 

I also can't cry. Like I want to but I can't. I haven't for months. 

I also have slowly lost my passion and interest for thing. It seems as if the enjoyment has been sucked out of everything. This was a slow and gradual thing. It started with passion for piano, then books and then now I don't even enjoy eating or walking my dog anymore. 

Do I have depression? I'm seeing a doctor tomorrow about my mental health and I just want some advice first"
471,I’ve got another therapist appointment in a few minutes.,Wish me luck
472,"In your opinion what illness do you think is more serious, BPD or bipolar?","I know all illnesses are serious and I know that they should never be compared but if you had to pick which one you would prefer to live with, what would you pick and what illness is more scary to have?"
473,Therapist looks at his cell phone the whole time I'm talking?,"Is this normal? He's like the hunderdth therapist I've seen because nothing really works but he specializes in OCD so I chose him. He stares at his cell phone and scrolls through while I'm talking for the WHOLE appointment. I'm assuming he does it to make me more relaxed, or because he's assuming I have trouble making eye contact, but I've never said that or implied that I would be more comfortable if he did that. He's also kind of rude and blunt and strange. I don't know what to think? Is this normal? I've just never experienced this with a therapist before."
474,20 minutes,"I didn't know it was possible, but somehow in 20 minutes I just start ideating suicide, banging my head against my bed frame and trying to choke myself to the point of fainting. I'm so tired of myself. I can't believe I'm so broken that it legit takes just 20 minutes for me to fall apart. I miss stability. I miss being able to call people without feeling guilty. I miss  not punishing myself for everything and calling myself crazy. Sorry for this rant. I just needed it out of my head."
475,I'm still not happy,"Becides all the shit that had been going on May has been the ""best"" month of my life

Me and my partner celebrated 2 years. 
I moved out of a shitty student flat in a rough area, in with my partners loving family who have welcomed me with open arms. 
I did well in all my MSc exams and I got accepted on to my dream PhD.

Every stressor I had is gone now, so why aren't I happy. Why am I still up crying over non existent problems, creating situations in my head that won't happen and then dwelling on it? 
Everything is perfect now, everything is going great, why can't I enjoy this?! 
It's so frustrating, creating stress for myself out of nothing. 
I hate myself so much that I can't understand how these people could like me, I'm paranoid this is all some big joke at my expense. I feel like I'm losing it more than ever, I don't know how to express my feelings about it because it's so irrational and stupid. 

I can't register at the doctors here as they aren't taking applications and I can't use the wellbeing service at my uni. 

I just want to feel good, I don't remember the last time I felt truly good."
476,I don’t like the pressure people are putting on everyone to post about the protests,"When it comes to social media I like to stay lowkey and not draw attention to myself. I usually go by a rule where I never post on social media unless I know I want to with 100% confidence and no anxiety about it. If I post without knowing for definite that I want to I tend to overthink things such as the wording, what people will think etc. 

Today’s black out Tuesday and everyone’s posting stuff on their Instagram stories about what to do to support the movement and to speak up because if you don’t you’re siding with the oppressor and being complicit. I’ve donated, signed petitions, and I do a lot of research on racism and oppression against black people. Yet I was feeling like if I didn’t put anything on my Instagram I’d be ‘siding with the oppressor’ so I started reposting stuff on my instagram and giving my views on systematic racism. I’ve felt shit and uncomfortable since because I really didn’t wanna do it and disappointed for going against my morals and succumbing to peer pressure.

I think this “Openly with us or against us” attitude can be pretty harmful to people with anxiety issues"
477,I really don’t won’t to go to sleep.,"I don’t know where else to post this so...I honestly wrote this post to vent a bit but also to seek advice for my problems.Sorry for any spelling errors or grammatical mistakes!Okay so my reasoning for this is very stupid but if anyone here has seen my recent posts you will notice that I have been having problems with my arachnophobia and my new fear of certain bugs since the spiders have started to make babies in my room which is just great.But today everything was really bad,so I was on my iPad doing my schoolwork when I noticed a big spider on my ceiling so because I was scared of it being above me I got off my bed and waited for it to leave.....but it didn’t and instead it started lowering itself onto my bed.I ripped my blankets off and everything was just a big shit show from there which ended with me crying and shaking for around half an hour.Now it is nearly midnight where I am and I saw the same spider but this time I feel nauseous and I’m panicking again.I think that if it moved then I will start crying again.So I’ve decided to not go to sleep which I am aware is not healthy but I just so scared to fall asleep.Now normally,I stay up late into the night on my phone but tonight I have my headphones connected to that if I want to I can watch YouTube to try and pass the time or listen to some asmr which I’m the past has made me fall asleep.This is basically my plan for the night but I can’t do this every night.What should I do?Im to scared to attempt to remove any spiders from my room and my mum won’t help me so basically i have to wait this out for however long this lasts.I know this sounds stupid but I have even considered asking my mum if I can sleep in her room because although in the past it did take a while for me to fall asleep in there,I somehow feel safer when there are people with me when there is a spider."
478,How do you get over your closest and most trusted friend ghosting you?,[deleted]
479,I always keep suicide as an option.,"I’ve always kept suicide as an option. I don’t really put much effort into anything because I’ve always had the mindset of “If it gets really bad, I could just end it all”. I know it’s pretty selfish, but I feel like everyone would get over my death eventually and I would be happier in the long run. In school I don’t put effort into my grades because I always think “If i get bad grades and my uni reject me, I’ll just end it all” and it’s clearly a very negative way to think. 

I’m not sure at all why I think like this. I’ve had bad mental health before where I’ve had to talk myself out of suicide so maybe that’s it? I’m not really sure."
480,How do you get over your closest and most trusted friend ghosting you?,"Forward: I am an incredibly emotional person. I really really feel what I'm feeling, if you understand what I mean.

For context, here is the last message my friend sent me.

""Chill dude we're still friends. This passage is going to be very blunt. You're a good person, and I know I only come to you when I need to unload stuff which makes me toxic and I need to stop that. I am mentally fragile and that's why I'm not really capable of being a friend at the moment so I'm saving you from extra distress. You wanna know why we haven't hung out in a while? It's because my mind literally shuts off during the evening and I'm not even capable of turning on the computer to set up anything. That's how much my mental state has wreaked havoc.I won't disappear forever, please give me some time. Please don't reply to this message this time, see you later alligator.""

Me and this person had an incredibly close and trusting relationship. We talked about things and helped each other through issues that we never discussed with anyone else. Our shared troubles in life, questions about our sexualities and gender. They helped me come to terms with my liking of men as an amab person. They also told me things that I won't get into they are very personal. We met each other once for a day in a close city and then I went to their place far away for four days not soon after.

At 5 months I decided they were never coming back, and as an extremely emotional person I sent them a letter to officially end our friendship because closure is a big deal to me. Them just leaving with no other word hurt so much I needed to make the decision for it to be final.

3 months after the letter I sent to them I find out they joined a voice comm with some of my close friends that I've known all my life. They only know these people as acquaintances or okay friends and just... Hung out. That made me very angry.

I sent them a barage of text to their discord and phone and I was blocked everywhere and they left the server my friends are in.

I understand what they said in the text... They needed time to figure out themselves. But it has to be unexcusable to do this with no ""I'm doing fine. Still here. Don't text me"" messages. No words for 8 months. 0. Now this.

I am angry, distraught, sad, and depressed about what happened. At the 5 month mark I made the conscious decision to end it and I was working through a ""grieving"" process slowly and then they re-entered spaces I share without warning.

I doubt all of the conclusions I made about myself with help of that person and many pillars of my being feel like they're crumbling. I trusted them and they abandoned me.

Thank you for your response beforehand 😊"
481,Is it fair for my parents to get mad and yell at me whenever I ask for a day off of school because I’m truely sick?,"So I’m ( 17F) and whenever I feel sick I ask my Mum for the day off school ( as anyone would ) however instead of asking me what’s wrong and help me feel better ( like a typical Mum) she criticises me, yells at me and tells me I can’t have the day off; I’m having to basically debate my way to get a day off when I’m actually feeling too sick to go to school. Afterwards she will often complain about it to my dad downstairs ( you can clearly hear any conversation from downstairs from my room). I don’t ask often, majority of the time I am at school working my butt off. I study as soon as I get home so the most amount of conversation or interaction with my parents is driving to and from school ( it’s my last year of high school). 

I deal with social anxiety too so my self esteem is naturally a little lower and my confidence is too. This is something I deal with personally and isn’t something I talk to my parents about.

My Mum will always revert back to one argument “it’s because all you do is run off you your boyfriends house”, I only see my boyfriend once during the week because of school and on the weekend until Sunday ( which is nothing compared to how much my friends see their boyfriends, because my focus is on school). She could be meaning that I don’t see my friends, however my friends don’t really bother to put effort into making time with me after I tried so hard, so I only see them occasionally due to this and on top of the fact that it’s all our last year of school so it’s super busy. ( so the holidays are our best bet really)
It’s been making me super upset recently because it’s seeming the only person who actually cares about me is my boyfriend, and everyone else just criticised me. 

Is this all fair from my parents? Any suggestions on how to handle this?"
482,"My 14 yr old MTF child is not wanting to sleep. She has 4 diagnosis, talks to a therapist, sees a Psychiatrist but refuses to believe she needs sleep. How can I help her understand her mental health requires a regular sleep pattern?","So as the title states my child is sneaking around to stay up all night.  She cat naps here and there and outright lies about getting a full night sleep.  Once she goes to sleep she will sleep for hours.  She fights sleep by finding anything to keep her busy.  She is currently outside my room demanding to know what time the wifi will come back on for her stuff while blasting music and beating on the walls.  

I have set the wifi to go off at Midnight and come back on by 6 a.m. 

Whenever she begins this pattern of not sleeping she doesn't react or respond to stimuli in an appropriate manner.  She will plow through other family members because she's trying to get a drink and she will tell excuse me and expect everyone needs to move so she can get to the fridge.  My SO was in the process of cutting a watermelon and asked her to wait but instead she continued to push him out of the way while simultaneously telling him he should have moved for her.  

She hasn't showered in 4 days or even changed clothes.  The outfit consists of a button down with PJ pants.  She is supposed to leave for 6 weeks to spend time with her father but I'm afraid she is on the edge of a break due to not sleeping.  I really need some advice on what else I can do to help promote her self care."
483,I’m 19 and just got out of an abusive relationship,"Im not sure if this is the right place but I’m 19 and for the past year I had been in an abusive relationship. 
I have depression, PTSD and anxiety because of it but not seeing him everyday is literally killing me. I’d rather be with him and have him cheating/being physically, verbally and emotionally abusive than be alone like I am now. Except I’m not alone because I have my whole family and so many friends but it’s just not enough to fill the hole he left. 

My parents forced me to report it to the police and he is out on bail but has sentences of rape, assault and domestic abuse against him because of my report. 
I know he hates me and probably would have killed me eventually but it just hurts how little he gives a shit about me. I have a psychologist and I’m on meds for the depression and PTSD but I feel so empty and I keep having nightmares and I’ve still got the whole trial to come. He was my first love, how am I supposed to move past this? 

I haven’t told anyone but close family and friends but I feel like everywhere I go everyone knows about it, I feel like its written on my forehead when anyone looks at me. I’ve tried to date but I can’t be bothered to message anyone and the dates I go on I just am thinking the whole time about the fact I’ll have to eventually tell them about it and how angry he would be if he knew. 
Also I have scars that are still healing from one of the incidents and every time I wear a skirt or dress people point them out and ask about them. 

I’m sorry for the long story I just have so much that I don’t understand and no one u know seems to understand and I don’t now how to juggle it all. Anyone who’s been through something similar that would be able to share their coping mechanisms would really help even if it’s just a little thing. Thank you."
484,I think I have depression,So this is only my thoughts but I want to ask you awesome people for some advice. So I have all and I Mean All the symptoms of clinical Depression and had Suicide attempts. I have gone to many therapists and it worked for a month the not. And I recently came out. Please give me your opinions and advice.
485,Wondering what condition this man could have?,He repeats his sentences and always seems to lose his train of thought. He has hundreds of videos on Instagram and always talks about nothing. I am wondering what he could have? His Instagram is @funkevin628
486,I'm In A Terrible Spot Right Now.,"My mental health right now has not been this bad in years even during my breakup. I try to avoid the news about all the riots and stuff but I can't. It's always on in the living room because my dad is watching the news.

I want to go on reddit or Instagram and just look at memes but every page even meme pages are posting about starting a revolution or that it is the US's time to collapse like all other empires.

I try and try to avoid it all and just live my life but I can't. I play with my online friends and their talking about it, I hear the news all the time. 

I decided to hang with 2 friends to go to a nearby river and maybe hiking so I could just get away from the news and constant isolation and my dad freaks out on me because there is still a virus. I understand his point but I can't take this. I can't take being stuck in the house all day having to hear the news with no contact with anyone besides my dad and our alcoholic roommate.

At this point Im just eating edibles or smoking and listening to music until I get high enough to fall asleep. I can't speak to my therapist either because of lockdown. I can't see my sister or my aunt and uncle and cousin. I can barely even see my friends. I feel lost and hopeless. Rioters even got near my tribe to where people on the Res had to stand outside their houses and business to make sure no one tried to destroy them."
487,another post sorry,I'm so burnt out. Im gonna die in my sleep. I hope. The cuts are healing and im scratching them to feel more pain. i wish i was someone else. im boring useless and shit at life. Maybe dying is a good thing maybe dying is a good thing maybe dying is a goodthing
488,Was put on citalopram because of persistent anxiety and occasional ED possibly caused by the stress. Just figured out that citalopram causes ED. What should I do?,Idk what to do. I was hoping a drug that would lower my stress would help me with getting it up but now Im scared itll make things worse. Im [22/M] btw.
489,I relapsed I’m self harm and now i feel out of control,"I’ve been self harming on and off since i was 10 (19 now) but was clean for the past 2 years. I truly thought that i was over that part of my life but i recently have fallen into a bad depressive episode and relapses two nights ago. Now it’s all i think about during the day. I feel like i literally can not resist the urge and I’ve never felt the urge be this strong before. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this so i feel so alone. I feel so ashamed and stupid that I’m dealing with these problems when there are much larger and more severe issues taking place across the world right now. I could really just use a friend, someone to talk to."
490,Why do I love hurting/manipulating people? (Reposted this from my other account because I didn't want people finding my name in search engines.),"What is wrong with me? I notice that as I've gotten older, leaving people and manipulating them has become my daily thing to do. I truly enjoy hurting others and it makes me feel like I'm powerful. Am I an altruistic narcissist or is my ""martyr"" complex taking in account for this? I always find myself entering codependent relationships rather it be platonic or romantic but I don't feel as if I'm being stressed out as much. I take them depending on me and needing me-to install a false sense of security and safety. I tell them what they want to hear and I make them feel more as if they can't live without me. It's like they become a vulnerable child while talking to a stranger- letting that person know every piece of valuable information about them. After a while I end up leaving- disappearing from their life. Just knowing that they're hurt and cry to themselves over me makes me smile. I know that they do these things because they say things like ""I need you. I'll be broken without you."" And it shows in every gender/age group I date. I don't think that I'm an emotional person or atleast had the time to finish emotionally reconnect/mature in myself. I see patterns in people( I know how they act and what they'll say) just by noticing their movements or the way they switch in texting. I believe people take my silence as a sign of compassion. My therapist has never diagnosed me with an illness relating to narcissism or similar things. I've been abused in many ways growing up as a child rather it be at home or bullying at school, being groomed by older people and so on. Is this just me ""protecting"" this inner child and being stoic? I'm not eighteen yet but I will be in a month and a half. I just really need to figure out the cause behind my behaviors. I feel like my therapist doesn't take anything into account but recently, they did tell me that I had adhd since I was a child and I never knew that. I feel like there's other things I don't know. I have other illnesses that I won't list here because I feel like it doesn't matter in this case. People have also told me that I act very weird and strange. I don't notice these things until people point them out. My voice is very deep and flat and whenever I feel an emotion, my body doesn't display those things. But it's not like I feel trapped. Sometimes people would ask me if I'm okay because I'll just sit quiet and stare for a very long time and I don't know what they're getting at. I get called creepy countless of times. I'm a very dominant and domineering person as well. I dress myself nice, I always smell good. I have good grades and people envy that. I also know that I have a masculine persona and that doesn't correspond to my birth gender: being a female. I think that if I'm not a narcissist-then I must be some type of sadist with a large ego."
491,My best friend is gone insane??,"I have a long distance friendship since 2018 with a guy who I consider my best friend. We get along so well and we understand each other like no one else. He has always been a rational, smart  and creative guy who could talk about a lot of different topics with a real interest. He comes from a Christian family but he has never been the guy who would talk about the bible or God repeatedly and incessantly. 
Unluckily we had a fight at the start of the year and we didn’t call each other during these last months. 
He texted me again 2 days ago and he said he was sorry for how things have gone between us and he told me he wanted me to know he cared for me. So I decided to give him a try and we started to talk again because I missed him but.. he isn’t himself anymore...we really didn’t have a proper real conversation because his responses to everything i said say didn’t make sense: he told me countless times to “ listen “ “ stare at the sun “ “ hear the voice of God” even if i was talking about some random staff like having breakfast. It started to scare me. He says he has found God and when i told him i wasn’t a religious person he responded with “ you will soon understand:)” it was so creepy. It looked like he was constantly in a unconscious state, he was always happy without any mood swing, but in a frightening way, he sounded possessed by something ( not in a literal way ). It looked like he wasn’t “ there” with me but in another place mentally. His rants about God didnt make sense at all because he didn’t sound like a profoundly religious person but like someone who has lost his mind.  He didn’t say anything about himself the whole time and he didn’t ask how I passed the last few months, it seemed like he didn’t care about people or the world anymore because “ God” was with him. He says he had a “ realization “.  He was completely irrational. Even if i called him an asshole for not listening to me he didn’t seem to mind it at all. He was laughing all the time and smiling creepily. 
Is it possible that he suffers from some kind of mental illness? 
He has some unresolved issues/trauma and i think he have gone mad because no one tried to help him psychologically."
492,I'm upset and embarrassed and don't want to go to work or do anything,"I yelled at protesters the other day... I had, sort-of-basically-in-a-way presumed on an emotional hot-take that they were all looters and rioters.

I don't think that the protests were well thought out or anything, and I personally believe the issue of police brutality should be broadened out from being about race and distanced from things like antifa... that's just my opinion and I'm sorry if that bothers anyone I don't want to be a bad person....

But when I see all this burning and see what my life is right now, I get so angry. Honestly, I get angry and anxious a lot. I don't know why, but I do... there's always something I hate.

I want to walk away down the road and never come back so I can start over and maybe then I can have a wife and kids and friends to keep me from being dumb... Because I am a dumb and terrible person who is consistently jealous and consistently wishes he could put blame on someone or be strong in some way.  
But I don't know. Maybe I'm just rambling now... but I just feel so much like I don't want to go outside and try to understand this shitty world where everyone probably hates, pities me, or worse they like me but I'm just an emotional burden waiting to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is ruined forever. I'll never change and I'll always be a depressed terrible person that no one likes for very long. I wish I was a narcissist so I could be rich and ignore everything. I tried to make myself be a complete narcissist a day or two ago, but it doesn't work like that.  
I don't want to understand things. I don't want to be a burden on my manager or coworkers, bringing them down with me when they had a point. I want to just go away and die and never come back.  
I'm not even able to make friends. I have a family that lives a ways away, but that's it.

  
I wish I was smart enough to do things for people. I'm an engineering student, or was, but that only means I can do math and actually, even though I am (was) at calc2, I'm really slow with math and probably got there on a fluke not to mention calc2 is useless. 

I have nothing to contribute to society.

Not my shit job pushing carts which I barely do because I'm burnt out and sad, and not... well not anything else at all...

I would fancy myself a writer, but I don't have anything good or deep to say. Hell, I don't even know why I'm making this post it seems like a terrible idea and I feel like you'll just be mad at me  or something and I don't know why I'm thinking that because I don't understand anything any more...  


Just leave me alone..."
493,Do I have social anxiety or am I just extremely shy?,"Wow so this is my second post of the night.You can really see where my mental health is going.Anyways, my whole life I have been very shy but in recent years my shyness has gotten worse.For example, I start to panic when I have to talk with someone I don’t want to,I try to avoid social interaction (I’m fine with friends and stuff) at all costs,I have a really bad habit of not making eye contact with people,I’m terrified of having to ask a teacher for something and I always feel like everyone is looking at me and judging me to the point where I will take a different route home from school if I am alone and I see people from my school.The most severe thing that happens to me is that if I have to stand up and read something in class or if I am the centre of attention for a bit then my heart starts beating quite fast and my chest aches (kinda idk how to describe it) and I have to take a few minutes to just sit down and calm myself.I know I am probably just very shy but still....if anyone has answer I would be grateful!"
494,anxiety,So ive been having panic attacks for the last 2/3 years and and my dad gave me Xanax one of the days to help me and it really helped but I dont know how if i go into a doctor how to tell them that and I apparently after looking at symtoms for alot of other disorders i fit alot of the symtoms for bi-poler like getting really happy and over confident and then really sad and depressed and borderline suicidal even though I dont think i would do anything its really scary when im happy becouse idk what i could do but when i feel okay i dont think its worth going to the doctor becouse im waisting there time and when im sad I think theres no point to anything.
495,I’m so tired.,"I’m tired of school, of my mom, of myself. I’m tired of everything. Mostly school though, even though I’m always skipping classes. I don’t really have a live, I just sleep, play CS:GO, eat, cut myself, and wash my hands compulsively :) What an amazing life I have!"
496,"I need advice, I can't work this out alone.","This is going to be long so I really appreciate anyone who even bothers to read all of it let alone give any advice.

I'm on antidepressants and currently getting ""help"" from a UK organisation called Minds Matter as I was referred by my GP. I went for 10 sessions of what she called talking therapy in which we discussed a whole bunch of things and I was assigned tasks to do to try and help me stay in control of my thoughts. And I found that having someone I could talk to, even just every other week, that I could be honest with and just vent to really really helped.

At the end of those 10 sessions (in January) she referred me for ""some more intense CBT"" and so I was put on a waiting list and then contacted a few weeks ago to arrange having telephone sessions each week because covid. 
I'm 2 sessions in and so far it's mostly just been him pushing me to tell him about the problems I have, how it effects me and what causes those problems which for me just sucks. It's like I'm being made to have a conversation with myself when I don't really know what I'm doing and I'm just guessing but then that's being taken as fact and then I don't get a helpful response just another question about that thing or we move on to something else. If I wanted to do that I'd write it down after spending hours thinking about it some nights unable to sleep not in my Lunch hour on a Friday over the phone with someone I've never met.

Which leads me to my dilemma. 
On the one hand I feel like I should try to tell someone at Minds Matter this and end the sessions and stop wasting everyone's time. I've seen a service advertised on here called better-help.org which looks like it could be helpful. And while it's £200 / month and I'm only an apprentice I don't exactly have many outgoings so I can justify it I suppose. 
On the other hand I have no idea how I'd even make the call to start that conversation never mind having it. It terrifies me, and I'd feel rude that these people are trying to help me at no cost to me and I'm just going to call it quits at 2 sessions? Maybe if I just bear with it, it'll start to pick up and be helpful. 

But then again I'm skeptical of any service that starts by asking me ""So what do you hope to get out of this therapy?""
I was caught off guard by that and didn't give a proper answer but now I've had some time to think here's the honest answer for anyone that's made it this far. I want the same thing that scared 15 year old me did when he walked out of college at 09:30 and rang up the doctors surgery with the phone call that started all this. To be able function normally without having to feel like the smallest tasks require some Herculean effort."
497,Longest three days?,"I've always considered myself a mentally and physically healthy person. Whenever something happened, I had always thought ""it'll be better in the end anyway"" so I wouldn't be too bothered. I always thought I was kind of mature compared to a lot of others but now I'm thinking that they're all mature in a lot of ways that I'm not. One poster I spent my entire grade 5 year staring at was ""Everyday isn't good but there's something good in every day.""

About 4 days ago, my parents and I had a pretty alright day. After dinner my mother jokingly put her hands on my boobs and said how my bras feel a lot emptier after I had lost weight. I don't like when she touches me but she used to say it was to do with skinship. I had smacked her hand very hard multiple times and told her to stop it. She laughed about how much it hurt. She had an argument with my brother for an hour or two and when everything was resolved, she came back and she threw herself onto me making a sort of vacuuming noise with her mouth as she tried to kiss me. 
I could tell she was drunk and I felt really uncomfortable with her being on top of me so I tried to push her off and when she finally got off of me, I moved to a different couch. 
Later on something happened and my mother started crying about how she was a prisoner in this house and treated like a slave. She had no job and she had little to no friends and no reason to leave the house other than grocery shopping.
She said she wanted to work and I said that she's perfectly capable of doing what she wants and no one was holding her back. She then said she needed supporters and my dad and I said that we would support her. She asked my dad if it mattered if it made money and my dad told her to do anything she wanted. I guess it was so that she could stop complaining about many things. She screamed at us about how no one would sacrifice things for her. She had sacrificed everything for my brother, my dad and I but she had nothing for herself. I understood where she came from and I felt bad for her but I didn't understand why she was still angry even when we told her we would support her.

My dad asked her why she always used alcohol to talk about her thoughts and she screamed that we wouldn't let her talk about these things when she's sober. This has happened a couple times before so I really just wanted to leave. She screeched and threatened divorce. This time, I really wanted them to get a divorce. I would live with my dad. Previously and usually, I would've been against a divorce. I guess I really hated the thought of having a broken family. 
She was still going on about her being slave and I screamed back at her that she wasn't the only person suffering in this family. I was upset about all the times she made me want to kill myself because of her words. The same woman who said she would die with me if I had decided to kill myself has now wanted nothing to do with me. 

I had screamed that it's time to go to sleep. I stormed up the stairs and when my mother continued screaming, I tried to raise my voice to drown out hers and told both of my parents to shut up and that it's time to sleep. I had repeated this multiple times and when I reached my room, I locked all my doors and closed my curtains. I laid in bed crying my eyes out and listening to loud music so that I couldn't hear their voices. I've never acted this way and I wanted to scream into my pillow but also pretend like I didn't exist. My throat hurt that night and my eyes felt like they do when you cry like hell at night.

The next two (maybe three) days were painful. The day I am writing this is the third day after that night.

The first day, I barely went downstairs except to eat. For lunch, I went downstairs and read all the text messages my mother had sent at around 1:35am (the fight took place at around 11pm). It was about how my mother wanted nothing to do with our family. How the people with the same blood was so selfish or something. She said something about each person twice and pretty much said she was done with this family. It felt like she decided to stop treating me like I was her child. I decided to tell myself that I shouldn't call her mom

The food tasted really bland and I couldn't swallow. My dad said something like ""thank you for the food"" like we always say before eating but this time my mom didn't say anything. I can't remember too well but I think my mother said something about how she was treated worse than a maid and I had pretty much started choking on my food. I wanted to cry but I didn't want to show my mom that I was weak or that I was a crybaby, which I am. She always hated crying kids and I discovered that I hated screaming/crying people thanks to her.

I finished my food quickly, pretty much gulping down the rice and extremely hot soup. I wanted to leave as soon as I finished but I decided to wait until my dad had finished eating. I quickly cleared the plates and ran upstairs and joined my next online class. I cried more and when I was called or asked to turn my camera on, I pretended like they didn't work. I felt like such a burden.

My doors were locked again and I just listened to loud music again. I didn't pay attention to my lesson but I never pay attention any attention anyway, so what's different?
I texted my friend during our lesson that ""Not gonna lie, I've never wanted to do drugs until last night"". I guess I don't know how drugs work but I really just wanted to enjoy listening to loud music in the dark. I'm grateful that my friend is kind of awkward because it made me think a little more about how the thoughts I had were kind of harmful. That day it took me a while to figure out what emotions I was feeling. I was able to find the conversation I had with my friend as funny but when she had to go, I felt kind of torn. I wasn't thinking about much. Probably staring at my mess of a bed. Usually I make my bed every morning but I just couldn't bother fixing it.

Later that day my friend came back and we talked about all the alternative names for the male genital and also she sent me poems about them too. I should thank her for keeping my mind off of.. family or myself. Just joking about being disowned. I thought later that day in bed if I was a shitty friend for choosing to talk to newer good friend about my personal problems. I was afraid I would be judged by my main 'group' of friends if I told them. One of them had called me abusive a couple years ago and many of my friends told me that she and her parents talked about how she hated me so maybe that's why I was afraid to tell my group about what happened. Maybe I was just afraid of being portrayed as another one with a terrible family.

The second day I decided to stop talking to her at all. I got everything I needed from my dad instead. My mother went to buy some clothes and came back with donuts and stuff. My parents were laughing and having a pretty good conversation but then she was distant to me. We talked a little bit here and there and I'd try to hug her but I would probably be more successful not trying at all.
In the evening, I was called for dinner but I had answered that I didn't want to eat. My door was closed and my mother screamed at me. I didn't want to raise my voice so I sent text messages but she didn't read them. I screamed back that I didn't want to heat but I still went downstairs and ate because I figured she would've made the food and I was too late. I kind of forced everything down again. There wasn't much stuff that felt edible. Normally my mom makes really amazing things but I guess I lost my appetite. Maybe I'll use it to lose some weight. 

I later apologised for shouting at her and told her that I'll be eating by myself when I feel hungry. I'd eat cereal since no one in our family eats them much and it's quick/easy. She sounded a bit sad when she asked what I'd be eating. When I tried eating when I was hungry the last time, she was a bit sad because the only time she got to see me was for when we ate.

Recently I have been spending a lot more time downstairs but after the fight, I've locked myself in my own room. I think we all needed our own time.

The next day (third day), my mom still called me for lunch and dinner. I told her I wouldn't eat but she still called me. I stayed for a bit downstairs and we did better I think. My mom was talking a lot more. For some reason I can't remember too well, even though it was a couple hours ago.
When they went out for a smoke, I walked outside into the garden with them and I said that it's my first time coming out in days and my mom said ""no it isn't. You came out the other time"" but after I said those were days ago, she said something along the lines of: ""oh it was since I was being pouty/upset/holding a grudge.""

Not sure what it is exactly but translation said pouty. 
This story is probably all over the place. Can't think straight, I just kept crying while writing this. I felt/feel so tired. I wanted and was ready to throw my life away. The past few nights I felt too tired to move. Too tired to go to the bathroom after I wake up. I've become increasingly tired this year for no reason and I don't know how to feel.
I'm beginning to feel as though I may have autism and that I'm bipolar with the way I've been acting towards people or constantly having to ask how to feel about something. Constantly having to move one part of my body. Maybe flapping my arms gently in a sort of T-pose manner I guess. Actions I've never done so far. I don't know how to feel. Doubting all my friends and constantly asking why they're around. Why the guy who keeps asking to see me every day really deals with me. Why he insists on trying to talk to me when he knows I'm difficult and bratty.

I want to stop living but not die."
498,writing a letter to the man who raped me,"I was raped by my teenage uncle when I was between the ages of 5-6. This past year was the first time I ever sought help for it thru therapy and although I am better, I still have a long ways to go. I really want to write a letter and send it to my uncle, and let him know that this is something I haven't forgotten and that it's damaged/shaped my life in ways that he probably didn't even think it could when his bitchass decided to do what he did. Is this a wise decision lol"
499,Moving out at 16 ( advice please !! ),"Hi, I have psychosis depression and so does my sister who is now 22. Majority of people in life who have entered to help me have brought up the fact that majority of my trauma comes from child trauma from abuse. I’m scared of my parents and haven’t had a close relationship with them for as long as I can think back. I’ve been working jobs since I was 13 since my parents would constantly never spend money of either of us and I don’t blame them cause I understand they had it hard too. Regardless they’ve cause lots of pain to me and my sister. She had moved out the second she turned 18. Im 16 currently and have been told I should do a youth agreement for awhile now. Have my own housing and have my rent paid but I understand how realistically expensive a lot of things are. I’ve felt like I haven’t been ready to take up that offer for a long time now but now I’m starting to feel ready and seriously considering it. My parents have become seriously damaging since I was fairly young but just being the environment itself makes me triggered and feeling uncomfortable very often. I can not explain how much I hate living here. Has anyone done a youth agreement or have any advice for myself? Thank you all for reading and I hope you all have a good rest of your day. :)"
500,My brother is depressed. Is there anything I can do?,"I’m not really sure where to start. My younger brother and I (M) are young adults living in our parents house. We never had to worry about anything growing up: everything was handed to us and our parents are generous and never fought each other. That being said, my brother developed some sort of mental illness. I’m guessing it’s OCD with depression and anxiety. I’m not too sure what triggered it because (from what I understand) he was once a happy and  healthy child and never had to worry about anything really. He is on medication but we all worry about him a lot. His relationship with his siblings and friends is very normal (we share similar interests and love talking about anything and watching tv n gaming together). But I think he has some deep anger towards my mother. He never does this in front of me but she has told me that he yells at her and blames her for belittling him and his condition. What’s more is that my parents found a knife in his room under his pillow. Again, I’m really worried about him and not sure what I should do (if anything). I talked to him and let him know that I was there for him but he sorta just brushed it off. Also, I think he has no desire to change his situation and has just sorta given up. I just wanted to share my situation. If anyone has any advice, let me know."
501,How do I tell my boyfriend and counselor that I think I have OCD?,"So I am a really anxious person, I live in a constant state of fear that I can almost never get out of. The best days of my life are when I have little anxiety and feel level headed, even if nothing fun happens but those days are so rare. I am not able to physically be with a therapist due to quarantine but I was able to get a free counselor online. I appreciate her but she often speaks over me and I don’t feel like I can tell her everything without her interrupting me. I still am really grateful for someone to speak to professionally though because it’s years overdue. I took some online anxiety tests and all of them came out moderate to severe. I told her this and she believes I have it as well so that’s that. I took some other tests such as depression, ptsd, pretty much every mental health illness in the book and I show pretty much no symptoms of any of those, as they all came out minimal/no risk. However, I started looking into OCD and I started deeply researching it and how it’s linked to things such as constantly daydreaming throughout the day, anxiety and other symptoms and I took tests and they gave me pretty much worse results than the anxiety tests gave me. I want to bring it up to my boyfriend but I’m so scared because he doesn’t understand. I don’t know if he truly believes I have anxiety and he does help me but he thinks I should just “stop overthinking” and just “recognize the bad thoughts and disregard them” and basically he’s just a lot more level headed than I am. The thing is I KNOW that these thoughts aren’t real, I KNOW that they’re intrusive but I can’t stop. I multiple big waves of anxiety over little things or sometimes even nothing and it affects my breathing, heart rate and more, I physically cannot do anything in those moments. It’s more than what he thinks it is. I am afraid to go to my counselor about it because I don’t want her to speak over me like how she usually does because I honestly feel like she doesn’t take me seriously either. I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’m trapped. I want nothing more but to be happy, a social butterfly and live at peace with myself, with my relationship and with the things around me. I hate feeling like I live in my own head all the time. I want to get better but it’s hard to when you feel like no one takes you seriously"
502,"Finally deleted Facebook, Twitter, and Insta",After all the recent events around the US and how everyone is talking and treating each other I finally had enough and deleted all my social media apps and only have Reddit left. I felt weird at first because I almost felt a little bored at times and I was disappointed with myself because of that but I am a lot happier now that I’m not seeing all the crap people so carelessly post. I only ever used social media for memes and other things never posted my personal life online I was wondering if social media ever got to other people like that and what did you do to help with that!?!?
503,I don’t want to die but I don’t want to keep living,I feel like the only option I have is to be dead because I’m tired. I’m tired of trying anymore I’m tired of everything I’m tired of having to feel so awful whenever I have to reach out to a close friend because I don’t have anyone. And then they have to hear everything I say and get disappointed in me whenever they check up on me because if I lie then that just makes me seem a certain way but if I tell them the truth that I’m not okay then it’s just like I’m still at the same point and I haven’t put in any effort to get better. But I feel like I’m suffocating I feel like this is how it’s going to be because I feel like I have no potential for anything in my life and I just hurt people around me. But I don’t want to die because I’ll hurt people more. I just want the pain to be gone I want to live for once

506,"I don't know how to open up, and I think I don't have a choice... Wat do? [29 M Alberta, Canada]","I can't bring myself to pick up the FUCKIN PHONE and call for help. I've sort of gotten used to being the rock in somebody's life, and I *will not fail*.

I got in some legal trouble and I think if I just tell the truth to a therapist/shrink, and also to a lawyer, then they're going to let me out scott free. (Which in my opinion is *bullshit* but if I go away.... Might as well just jam a samurai sword in my gut).

I'm scared, and I'm hoping somebody might help walk me through it.

The *worst* part is that it's gonna have to be over the phone... Meaning I can chicken out and hang up anytime... I don't know if that's just me fooling myself but it feels like a brick wall.

Help.....?"

508,Falling down,"I had a really shitty weak mentally. Constantly thinking negative thoughts, feeling worthless and the works. 
I've had major trouble getting over my ex (it's been 3 years and i still want to get her back). 
Feelings of jealousy of other people's lives, shifting into anger. 
I tried writing it out today and it had a line about how a fucking friend had more success on tinder. 

I sent the document to my therapist and the friend in question. Now i worry that might damage the friendship... 

At the end of the day i've fallen back into some of the habits i've tried to leave behind (excessive masturbation,  not having a sleep ritual, sleeping at late hours, screentime before sleep, drinking alcohol) 

My mind was ruminating so badly that a real sense of dread was setting in. I have only this friend that i trust, and i feel like i am becoming more bitter and egotistical and mean lately. 

I'm trying so hard to become better but i can't..."
509,Suicide Note to my Parents,"Hey everyone, I am feeling quite down so I drafted up this letter to my parents.  I am NOT in imminent danger of suicide, I mostly wanted to vent my feelings and express the deep pain I am in....


Dear Mom and Dad,

    I didn't want this.  I didn't want to have to say goodbye like 
 this, but I cannot continue.  I am no longer the person that I once   was.  You may not have seen it or wanted to admit it, but it's true.    The old me is long gone, and I don't know what happened to him,   but I firmly it's due to my undiagnosed head injuries.  I am   broken.  I hate to admit it, but for the past 5 or 6 years I have   simply been putting on a facade of happiness. And as you know, I   have broken down many times, simply because I could not muster   the strength to act as normal and ""happy"" as possible.  I mourn   the loss of my former self consistently, and I fondly reflect on the   years when I was an upbeat and optimistic kid.  I used to be so  
creative and would love to engage and be with you guys.  Nothing   about you guys has changed, its just that I cannot empathize and   relate to people anymore.  Human interaction is a laborious task   for me, and I am unable to connect and feel with others.  I feel   this is also why I have never had a girlfriend, or able to care for   Joey, I am emotionally incapable. I am really sorry about Joey,   Mom and Dad.  I was never the brother that I should have  been...he never did anything to me, it's just that whenever I am   with him I feel NOTHING, just emptiness, and awkwardness. The   only feelings I can feel are sadness, anger, discontent, and fear.   Yet, I remember I was once so bubbly, loving and full of life. My   ability to perceive positive emotions is destroyed. I go from sun up   to sun down without an escape from my pain.  I drink, I smoke, I   sit for hours and hours in the backroom to make myself feel at   least marginally better, but to no avail.  It all makes so much   sense, the head traumas.  Running into the glass at the library as   a kid, the pogo stick over the cement, the ski lift in Lake Tahoe,   and countless others. It all has had a cumulative effect on my   psyche.  From the injuries sustained as a kid, came the unyielding   mental illness which plagued me for the majority of my life, OCD.    Born from that illness were my sleeping, breathing, swallowing,   and anorexia issues.  Then later in my life, the intense depression   and anxiety.  I am not living, I am simply just existing day by day.    The entire course of my life was thrown off because of hitting my   head.  I am numb.  I shouldn't be working at Infosys, and I   shouldn't of attended CCSU.  I engaged in both because I thought   it was the right thing to do, and I wanted to make you guys happy,   not because I wanted to do it.  At graduation, which was supposed   to be one of the most uplifting and exciting times in my life, I felt   almost no happiness.  This all feels like a bad dream, and I have   been in denial for years believing that maybe, just maybe, this   was all in my head.  I have realized that it is all real, all the pain,   all of the misery, everything.  Living a fake life, with a fake   personality, is not right for you guys and for me.   I am sorry that  It has to turn out like this, but carrying on like this for the rest of   my natural life would be misery.  I love you guys....even if I can't   experience love like I was was once capable of. I love Joey,   Grandma, Bo, all of my Aunts, Uncles, cousins, and friends.  Please   relay this message to those people, and to whoever you feel is   appropriate. Also, please have my brain examined and/or donated   to research. I want you to have answers as to what exactly went   wrong with me, and I want Neurology to have a better grasp on   the emotional impact of TBI.  By donating my brain, I will have   had some meaning to my short life, and have provided something   of value to the world. If there is a god, I will see you all in the next   chapter.  I hope to be in a better place, and to experience freedom   for the first time in a while. Goodbye Mom and Dad.  

With love,  
Your son, Ben"
510,SNRIs?,"After having failed both SSRIs and mood stabilizers in an attempt to treat my depression, my psych prescribed me an SNRI (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). I have never even heard of this class of drugs before so I was just wondering if anyone here has had any success with them. The brand she gave me is called Venlafaxine ER if that helps."
511,"Not a single person on this earth cares if I live or die, and no you reading this don't either","Don't say you're the one who cares. It's literally impossible for you to care individually about someone you know nothing about. Maybe you care about the idea of depressed/suicidal people. You can care about us as a group but you can't possibly care about *me* and you can't convince me otherwise. You say the same thing to other people on here and other mental health subs. Caring about depressed people as a whole and me as an extension of that is cool but it doesn't mean you care if I in particular die, any more or less than anyone else.




I want somebody to care about *me* and nobody does or ever will. Not a single person would be affected negatively by my death and actually a ton of people would be affected positively by it. Only reason anyone would care is the just sheer inconvenience of it. My work being down a person, my family being obligated to arrange a funeral or whatever (even though I say I really don't want one they'll have to cover their asses with one to pretend they cared), the bank not getting my payments anymore, etc. Nobody would *actually* care and that's final."

515,I’m so vulnerable and breaking down,"I don’t know how to pass this. My life’s image for a future keeps changing and I just don’t know what I truly want in life, or I do but I feel I’ve already missed those chances and can’t go back now. 

I’m unemployed and Dream is to blog and write. I want passion from life. I want to not be able to stop smiling like when getting on a rollercoaster ride. My mind hurts so much and I’m terrified to even admit it to anyone. I have a son and his dad is a pos who isn’t consistent and unreliable. I try to keep pushing through but how can my son be happy when his mom doesn’t even have the drive to get off the couch? To even smile? And then the thought “you’re mom isn’t coming back” and I start bawling my eyes out looking at him. I try to grasp reality again and realize I need to get a job and make money.. back to 9-5 and feeling utterly unsatisfied in life. 

Meanwhile, there’s an unresolved tense in the air from my boyfriend because I’m trying to work on myself. I have a strong, strong, codependency towards relationships.. I’m recognizing this and mentioned it to him.. because I didn’t want to go with him to visit his mom up north this weekend he says it’s suspicious.. what’s the prrovlem with wanting to spend the weekend together and had envisioned myself and son having a blast in her pool etc... all sounds great but I just don’t want to.. I’m self conscious about my stomach so I don’t want to go into the water especially around people I’m not totally comfortable with.. my son gives me a hard time and I can become overwhelmed, that’s vulnerable for me and don’t want to show it, the bed is extremely uncomfortable and no idea where my son would sleep... 

Idk. I have a huge choice to make to end things and focus only on myself and my son but that terrifies me.. I look to please others and hear their view point to determine how I feel about something and If I organically feel a type of way and it clashes then I change that view point.. Now thinking on being alone and needing to find strength to make enough money to support my son and I and to be able to move out of family’s home.. I just can’t even seeing it being possible. I’m too weak minded. It’s to complicated in here. The world is shit. I’m trying so desperately to hang on and stay alive to raise my son to at least 18/21 but that’s a long time when feeling like this. I’m at a lost for roads... one road I could have regrets and not feel totally related to on a deep level, be alone and crave that human touch and love.. I just want to be loved wholeheartedly and there’s a possibility for that too but comes with a list of it’s own challenges and is it just in my head? I just don’t know. 

My mind is hell. But if I end it.. I believe there is more than what we know and who knows if I’ll suffer an entire other worldly hell so I may as well as suffer here.. I don’t know.. I just want to be taken care of.. but I suppose that’s my problem with codependency..."
516,Suicide Note to My Parents,"Hey everyone, I am feeling quite down so I drafted up this letter to my parents.  I am NOT in imminent danger of suicide, I mostly wanted to vent my feelings and express the deep pain I am in....


  Dear Mom and Dad,

  I didn't want this.  I didn't want to have to say goodbye like this, 
  but I cannot continue.  I am no longer the person that I once was.  You may not have seen it or wanted to 
  admit it, but it's true.  The old me is long gone, and I don't know what happened to him, but I firmly it's due 
  to my undiagnosed head injuries.  I am broken.  I hate to admit it, but for the past 5 or 6 years I have 
  simply been putting on a facade of happiness. And as you know, I have broken down many times, simply 
  because I could not muster the strength to act as normal and ""happy"" as possible.  I mourn the loss of my 
  former self consistently, and I fondly reflect on the years when I was an upbeat and optimistic kid.  I used to 
  be so creative and would love to engage and be with you guys.  Nothing about you guys has changed, its 
  just that I cannot empathize and relate to people anymore.  Human interaction is a laborious task for me, 
  and I am unable to connect and feel with others.  I feel this is also why I have never had a girlfriend, or able 
  to care for Joey, I am emotionally incapable. I am really sorry about Joey, Mom and Dad.  I was never the 
  brother that I should have been...he never did anything to me, it's just that whenever I am with him I feel 
  NOTHING, just emptiness, and awkwardness. The only feelings I can feel are sadness, anger, discontent, and 
  fear. Yet, I remember I was once so bubbly, loving and full of life. My ability to perceive positive emotions is 
  destroyed. I go from sun up to sun down without an escape from my pain.  I drink, I smoke, I sit for hours 
  and hours in the backroom to make myself feel at least marginally better, but to no avail.  It all makes so 
  much sense, the head traumas.  Running into the glass at the library as a kid, the pogo stick over the 
  cement, the ski lift in Lake Tahoe, and countless others. It all has had a cumulative effect on my psyche.  
  From the injuries sustained as a kid, came the unyielding mental illness which plagued me for the majority 
  of my life, OCD.  Born from that illness were my sleeping, breathing, swallowing, and anorexia issues.  Then 
  later in my life, the intense depression and anxiety.  I am not living, I am simply just existing day by day.  
  The entire course of my life was thrown off because of hitting my head.  I am numb.  I shouldn't be working 
  at Infosys, and I shouldn't of attended CCSU.  I engaged in both because I thought it was the right thing to 
  do, and I wanted to make you guys happy, not because I wanted to do it.  At graduation, which was 
  supposed to be one of the most uplifting and exciting times in my life, I felt almost no happiness.  This all 
  feels like a bad dream, and I have been in denial for years believing that maybe, just maybe, this was all in 
  my head.  I have realized that it is all real, all the pain, all of the misery, everything.  Living a fake life, with 
  a fake personality, is not right for you guys and for me.   I am sorry that It has to turn out like this, but 
  carrying on like this for the rest of my natural life would be misery.  I love you guys....even if I can't 
  experience love like I was was once capable of. I love Joey, Grandma, Bo, all of my Aunts, Uncles, cousins, 
  and friends.  Please relay this message to those people, and to whoever you feel is appropriate. Also, please 
  have my brain examined and/or donated to research. I want you to have answers as to what exactly went 
  wrong with me, and I want Neurology to have a better grasp on the emotional impact of TBI.  By donating 
  my brain, I will have had some meaning to my short life, and have provided something of value to the world. 
  If there is a god, I will see you all in the next chapter.  I hope to be in a better place, and to experience 
  freedom for the first time in a while. Goodbye Mom and Dad.

  With love,
  Your son, Ben"

518,Support?,"Hey
I'm feeling pretty lonely and anxious right now, and I was wondering if someone could possibly reach out to me through pm. It's obviously okay if not or if you don't want to, you don't have to."
519,How can I begin to lose weight without triggering my ED?,"Or if I do trigger it, are there any ways to keep in in track and not self sabotage?"
520,I don't know how to 'feel'?,"Alright, I don't like talking about my feelings but what the hell. The past couple of years went by so quick. Screwed thing up with my first love back awhile ago and have finally fought my way back to where I was before I met her. I got a different job just like my dad. My mom had an head trauma and she's short tempered. I just finished school with plans of a future study. However I can't seem to sleep. All I feel the past couple of weeks is if I am zoned out. I just want to sleep. But everytime I lay in bed I wonder about the things I could have done differently. Would my live have been better. I ain't the slimmest person in the world, could I have prevented that? I stopped smoking marijuana about a few months ago and stopped drinking just some weeks ago. No I don't have the urge to drink or smoke. But i just don't know how to feel. Everything feels so gray. And everything feels like a chore. I really want myself to be a better man but I can't even step outside for just 2 seconds. I only go out for my job or some friends who invite me. I just don't know what to do, what to say. Or how to feel. I can't seem to focus my eyes go all over the place or just stare. I catch myself alot during the day staring right through the ground or something like that. Just standing all frozen like if I am about to faint. Yet I don't faint.  Any help?"

522,i dont even think i would have been uselfull anyway," so i come from a family where to speak to males before marriage is shamefull whatever you get the kind of family it is. so some of the consequences of speaking to a male would be eneugh reason to disown me. my parents wouldnt think twice. i was stupid and spoke online to a boy. it wasnt even what you think it was a friend talking about harry potter. my brother was going through my laptop and saw and for nearly half a year he has been blackmailing me with it. at first it was small but now whenever he feels like it he will mention it. he uses the name nathan because he doesnt know the name of the person i spoke to. so randomly he says nathan and im scared. he says it all the time and im sure my parents are going to become super suspicous of me if everytime my brother says the name nathan i freak out and do whatever he wants. im crying right now because its getting too out of control. i broke down twice today because i dont know what to do. im a shitty person i know , im the one who screwed up and now im going to have to suffer. thing is it coincidently happened around the same time another serious event in my life happened involving another person. i have no idea what to do because whith quarantine going on i dont speak to anyone and right now im in a situation i cant talk to anyone as my list of friends - are close to nonexistent. so with no one to talk to and my brother being super controlling im sure im going to end up being found out . im scared because i know my parents wont bash an eyelash about throwing me out the family or worse with the thing i did. i keep thinking dark thoughts and i hate it and myslef because thats dumb and cringey and stupid but its my fault because for some reason all i do in life is fuck up im scared im scared im scared i dont know what to do"
523,I need help figuring out how to start therapy,"I live in the USA, and I've been slowly dropping into a rut and feeling more and more depressed, falling further behind in my life. I want to go to a therapist to figure out how to get past this, but I have heard lots of horror stories and am not flush with cash. How do I find a good therapist?"
524,does an ed ever really get better?,"my ed started severely when i was 13 now i am 21 and i still struggle i've been through therapy, times where i was ok, but some how it always comes back. this mentality has been programmed inside of me for pretty much 8 years and that would be so hard to conquer. i'm a lot better than before but i always questioned when is it truly going to get better."
525,What is the point to living?,"I mean, what would change if I were to die tomorrow vs dying in like 60 years? If there is no afterlife, than their literally is no point to life. No point to working hard if theres no end goal. If there is an afterlife, than wouldn't it he better to go their? And even if hell is real and I go there, wouldn't it be better to just start it now? What changes in the grand scheme of things if I start my eternal damnation tomorrow vs in 60 years?

And I dont want any disney channel answers either. Lifes what you make it. It's all about the journey. It's the bonds you make along the way. 

A genuine, real answer would be appreciated."
526,Disabled dad wants to leave to be with mistress after suffering brain injury from covid,"Basically, my dad has been having an affair in a different state where he works and has an apartment for a few days a week. He broke up with his gf 4 weeks before he got sick. He got corona and was on a ventilator for 4 weeks and had to learn to walk again after rehab. He is at our home with my mom, his wife, but now says he has arranged plans to go to the other state this weekend. He has cancelled all of his PT appts and his legs are starting to swell. He obviously needs to stay with us at home because the mistress is a nurse and any germ could kill my dad. The doctors told us he refused all mental help and he clearly has ptsd/trauma from his illness. My family doesnt know what to do to convince him to stay with us and get him the help he needs."
527,As someone who struggles with BPD what is the worst or most difficult symptom you face? I have BPD and Bipolar but I would say the intense feeling of emptiness I can actually feel in my chest.,And also what is the best feelings you get having this illness?
528,Anyone else ever just feel empty for no reason?,"Today is one of those days for me. There’s no real reason, I just feel drained of emotional energy / any feeling. Yesterday was an amazing day. I had a great morning. Shortly after breakfast I realized I was getting irritated by the tiniest irritants, then out of nowhere (seemingly) this wave of numbness hit me. I know it will pass with time (rare but not the first time for me). Right now I just don’t feel i have enough energy to feel anyway about anything. My self care has been so consistent and wonderful lately, I also have been practicing a lot of mindful meditation. Today I’m just not here and I think that’s okay. 

I wonder if others have similar experiences? Where you have no reason not be anything but happy.... yet here you are but not feeling much of anything else either.. 

It’s almost a beautiful, serene silence in my head for once. Devoid of any anxiety for a change of pace personally. I just almost feel ashamed I’m not happy when I have reason more than most to be.

We’re all just out here doing our best, day by day, minute by minute."
529,"I signed up on Instagram years ago thinking it would make me feel less lonely, but it has the done the opposite.."," i feel even more lonelier than i initially was before signing up and i cant seem to get myself to delete it either because i think i have that fomo crap. in real life i dont have friends so i thought instagram would help but nothing. at this point i really just use it for shopping and reference. i want to delete it but at the same time i cant. i've felt more lonelier than usual. its annoying i hate feeling this way. if im not on ig then im on youtube alot...idk why i feel like if i disconnect i will lose contact of people that i dont even talk to on there or that if i do meet people i cant talk to in real life i cant connect with them online cause nowadays it feels like everyone just wants to communicate through social media and not even direct text messages anymore. i never thought the day would come where i would really miss getting text messages from my classmates everyday especially when texting phones were still popular.

does anyone here relate, if so do you find a way to cope somehow?"

531,Does anyone have experience with telepsychiatry?,"I’m 18 and I’m trying to figure out a way to see a psychiatrist without my family knowing. I want to get antidepressants and try to manage my depression before I start my freshman year of college. I’ve been looking at apps like Amwell, Plushcare, and LiveHealth and they are definitely cheaper than seeing a psychiatrist in the office. Does anyone have advice or feedback about any of these? Any other option will surely help."
532,I don’t know where to turn,"Welp time to ask strangers on the internet for help , here goes nothing 

Ime 20 years old , in the army , I have a stable job and a bright future with my degree path. I just don’t understand why I am so freaking miserable. 

I usually keep my problems to myself and I’ve been in a general state of sadness for 2 years now. It’s not unlivable but I can’t shake it. I can get through my days but it’s always there gnawing at the back of my mind. I don’t remember honestly being truly happy for a while now. I’ve tryed talking to close friends on occasion about it , and sure I’ll feel better for a day or two but it never stays that way and Ide hate to be a burden trying to ask again .Ide tell my parents but the usual response is to man up and I have to many blessings to be sad about things. This had led to me just generally staying quiet and just dealing with it 

This has led to a crippling feeling of loneliness. I deeply miss having a person to talk to . I have small circle of good friends but I just don’t feel like it’s the proper dynamic to bring up my problems.Most days I’ll get through without even talking to people. I usually try to fill the silence with YouTube and music because honastly i think ime afraid to be alone with my own thoughts of anxiety and inadequatetcy . Witch leads to self criticism and doubt . 

Some days I’ll just get through without even feeling at all


I’ve been to a few free therapists ( university provided ) and all of them have said ime fine but I dint understand why I feel so lost and miserable in life. Ide like to talk to an professional therapist but I never had the money to do so 

I hate this so much , I just don’t understand this 

I could elaborate further but I think the point has been made. I’ve tried everything I can think of so far but I can’t live like this for much longer I just can’t ........so thanks .....truley , for any advice you can provide . I need it right now 

Best wishes , 
A stranger"
533,Is it possible to have PTSD from two people making out?,"Okay this is going to be a weird post, and I'm not sure if it even really goes here.  Also, I should mention that I've had no real sexual trauma or abuse in the past.  However, I get incredibly grossed out by people making our or kissing or really anything that involves a tounge.  Like to the point that it gives me anxiety and I immediately get tense and uncomfortable.  Most people probably do but what is weirding me out about it is that I get repetitive thoughts of it happening replaying in my head and keep getting the feeling as if I'm about to have a panic attack.  Is this normal?  Is it PTSD or OCD? Anyone else get this and then immediately get depressed about feeling ""freaked out"""
534,Lost All Senses of Motivation within Quarantine,"By being cut off from my friends and most of society for more that 76 consecutive days I find myself having little to no motivation to do anything at all. I am 19 years old and have just finished my first year of college and I am struggling to find satisfaction in doing anything at all. When Quarantine initially started I was thinking to myself ""Oh this isn't that bad, video games with the boys every day and no school!"". I later found that I wouldn't be allowed to hang with all my friends that I haven't seen in so long (my spring break was a week prior to everybody else's and social distancing started the proceeding week). Although playing video games and communicating over Discord every day with my friends was fun, I eventually found myself having no enjoyment in gaming at all so I don't even attempt to do so anymore. I tried to stay occupied with swimming in my pool and going on bike rides, but I struggled to make the days feel different from one another. I feel as if my mind is completely clouded and I don't have urges to do much of anything anymore. Are these signs of Depression? Is anybody else feeling the way that I am feeling? How can I motivate myself to do things again? Please feel free to reply with your thoughts."
535,Tell me something nice about your day?,"Anything at all, I would love to hear it please!

I didn’t have the best of days but my sister cooked me some pasta today for lunch, that was super sweet of her 😊"
536,Why can't I feel empathy for social causes and things that don't directly affect me?,"I look at all the recent protests going on and I understand why its happening and why it needs to happen. But I just cant understand the lengths people are going to march and fight and protest. Even things as simple as posting the black square on instagram, I just have no compulsion to do this. 


For most people, you probably see me as a bad person, and I get that. Im just looking for answers as to why I'm like this. I feel bad for how much I don't care which doesn't make a lot of sense but it's what I'm dealing with.


I tried to talk to my girlfriend about it and she completely shut down. Now I feel even worse."
537,Can medication eventually lose it's effect on you?,"My medication doesn't seem like it's working like it use to. Admittedly there was a period recently where I wasn't taking it correctly and missing doses. But now I've been making sure to take them, but I'm getting anxious and depressed like I use to before. My brain might just have to re-aclimate to the medication, but I was just wondering if it's possible it may have lost its effect on me?"
538,"How can I get therapy and help for my autism so it doesn’t cause me to drive people away like this, preferably ever again?","I just need to vent a little. My parents have not gotten me the help I need, and as I’m an adult I will have to find it myself, without their help.

I'm autistic and that limits my social filter so I often say stuff I shouldn't. I really fucking hate myself for it.

Vented on a discord server. Someone reached out to me. Became acquainted, knew them for about 6 months. Started to get lewd with them, but got a bit too explicit on it. We were both furries; it was more on his character than himself, which I admit was pretty superficial. I probably shouldn't have done it in the first place. Only once did I ever say one time I rubbed one out to their character, and only twice ever did I say I had a small crush on them. (And I asked if I could confess before I said it.) They seemed to tolerate it, but then they told me to stop, I internalized it, felt extremely remorseful, and ceased anything lewd.

One day, months later, they block me out of the blue and expose what I said on twitter, and blocked out my name/profile pic with a clown emoji, ignoring when they told me to stop, and that I apologized and stopped all the activity. I tried writing a lengthy apology about a week later, they didn't even read it and blocked me again.

People are stupid, but I've learned my lesson. I probably shouldn't exist now lol. If my retarded parents found out, they’d likely try to filter my internet and make me miserable instead of getting me the help I need, so I’m keeping this a secret from them and asking where I can get help.

TL;DR: Title. [Here’s their perspective and my commentary](https://imgur.com/a/xFHQRt5), and my [apology](https://pastebin.com/ttdfzGbe)"
539,Is anxiety a normal side effect?,"(13, F) I've recently started on a 10mg Fluoxetine prescription, mainly to help with my depression and OCD. Recently, not too long after I first began taking it I've had continuous feelings of anxiety. I often get heart palpatations as well. I attempted googling for the answer to figure out why this is happening, but I wasn't able to find all that much. To anyone who may be on the same medication, is this a regular side effect? (Forgive me if this wasn't the correct sub to ask on, but responses would be appreciated.)"
540,I can’t work anymore,"I used to work in a pharmacy. I had a job there for about 15 years. But when covid happened, working became too intense for me. I was under so much stress. My boss got sick, people in my team were leaving and a lot was put on my shoulders. I couldn’t take it anymore. So I quit my job because I was close to a burn out and now I’ve been at home for the past 3 weeks, doing nothing, not leaving the house and wondering how I’m gonna find the strength to find a new job. Just thinking about it gives me anxiety. I can’t afford financially to stay home for much longer and I’m afraid I won’t find anything with a salary big enough to pay the bills. I can’t work in a pharmacy anymore but I don’t have any other skills. What should I do?"
541,My secrets are giving me anxiety after 15 years of pushing them away,I am in my twenties/female. I used to have a very good talent of pushing things I needed to forget to the back of my mind. It’s been working for about 10 years but suddenly this year they have been creeping back.. the worse secrets I have are when I was about 4-7 years old. But the rest are mundane worries and memories like saying the wrong thing 3 years ago to a friend that sort of thing. I can probably live with those and push those back again. But my dark memories from when I was young are stopping me from sleeping and making my heart race giving me the worse anxiety out of nowhere. Why now? After 10 years. I have been thinking of therapy but the thing is I don’t think I can ever speak about those memories. I physically cannot make the words leave my mouth. It will ruin my life. What I am asking is that is anyone else living with a secret and is it possible to live a happy life with one. I wish I could just push it back again like I did before. Maybe I can. Sorry for being so depressing x
542,Fear my son’s psychotic episodes,"I’m hoping those with some experience can advise me how to deal with severe anxiety caused by my 24 year old son’s psychotic episodes.  He was diagnosed at 19 with schizo affective disorder and has both visual and auditory hallucinations.  It’s been an awful 5 years of repeated hospitalizations, treatments etc but he never sticks with any medication or therapy.  We give him money for weed so at least it keeps him calm most of the time, but it’s supposed to make schizophrenics paranoid.  Even before the pandemic, he did nothing but play video games, sleep and go out for weed.  We’ve been told that he has cognitive disfunctions in addition to the mental illness and that he may never be able to support himself.

Friday morning we woke to the familiar noises of him throwing and banging stuff and he started cursing and screaming at me to stop showing up in his dreams.  He broke things in the kitchen and kept up this horrible rambling that didn’t make sense but the anger was so terrifying.  The anger is what’s new, I’ve never been so afraid.  I left the house while he screamed at me to come back, and I called the emergency mental health services to come over.  My husband stayed at home with him, the anger wasn’t directed at him as much. The police came too, and they all determined that since he calmed down and didn’t threaten to hurt himself or anyone, they wouldn’t be able to take him in.

Well, he calmed down the last few days but when he’s quiet and staring blankly I know he’s hearing and seeing things.  My husband says not to nag and leave him be.  Son said he would take his antipsychotic only if he needed to sleep.  

Now my anxiety is so severe, I can’t sleep and I have to work at home in constant fear that he’ll hurt me or my husband. We lock our door at night but it can easily be kicked in I’m sure.  My husband has some Xanax, so I’ve been taking that but I need some help.  It’s hard to find a therapist for myself right now, I’ve been calling but appointments are months away...thanks for reading because it helps to write this all down."
543,I don't know how to feel anymore.," I don’t know why suddenly I felt the need or urge to post. I think it’s just that I want to vent somewhere and have no were else to go. But I have mostly come to the terms that I think I have nothing else left to give. I can’t remember the last time I cried, or remember the last time I was happy. Things just seem dull and grey and it’s what it’s going to be. I have no thoughts of ending my life, I think I’ve come to terms that the rest of life is going to be cruise control. Some days it’s harder than others to get myself out of bed. I know there are reasons I am the way I am. I didn’t have a terrible life but it was far from a good one. I try to put on a happy face so those closest to me don’t worry. Is  it wrong even for the people closest to me that I can’t describe them as loved ones? I hope not, because for them I march on grinding my gears down till everything finishes. I know it’s selfish of me to stop seeing my doctors, not out of fear of what they might find. Instead  of not wanting to delay for whatever plans have been set  for me. I don’t even know why I’m writing this or what I expect. I just wanted to vent a little, thank you."
544,What to send to someone who doesn't get what being lonely or depressed or suicidal feels like.,"I just need videos or something that might be effective, especially the loneliness one."
545,Chat with a question-answering AI based on Banned Books - or watch the results live!,"I fed an AI context from banned books, from serial killers to Noam Chomsky to the occult and strange to some fairly complex manifestos.

546,I just want to ask a few questions...,"So some background info, I’m a minor and have a bad relationship with my dad. He’s controlling, abusive, and manipulative. I left him back in November to live with my mom instead. I tried to go to a hospital but I wasn’t bad enough for their care (self harm). Now I’ve gotten worse and, yes, I’m 20 days clean but my mind won’t stop spinning and all of this homework has been weighing down on me. My mom is better than my dad but not by much, she is also a major trigger for my anxiety when she yells at me to get my homework done. I need a place where I can get myself back together and strong enough so I don’t have a nervous breakdown every time my mom tells me to get my homework done.

So, here are my questions:

Does it show up on a background check?

If you go to a hospital for mental health reasons, will it affect future jobs/opportunities?

If I get a babysitting job, will people trust me less with their kids because I self harm?

Do both parents have to consent for me to go to a hospital and know which one? 

I’m in Canada if that helps

Thanks."
547,Finding out more and more about the United States is bringing me back into severe depression.,"I have manic depression and I was doing fine for a while. Like just taking meds and chilling out. But I’ve been staying up all night every night just watching videos and reading things about the protests and the riots. And then researching on Epstein and the people involved in it. And everything is just so fucked up. Everything’s corrupt and dark and negative. I’m doubting everyone. It’s like everything’s blurry. I can’t stop looking more and more into the country’s racism and human trafficking. Everything’s just happening all around me and I’m powerless. I just want to sleep forever. I can’t though, I have a 2 year old to take care of. I’m trying my hardest to put on a happy face and I hope she’s oblivious to my struggle. The days are starting to blend together."
548,Can’t shake the feeling that my parents think I’m a failure,"This is something that’s been hanging over my head the past couple of days and reducing my hours of sleep 

My parents both worked hard their whole life to give us the best opportunity at a successful life.  I’d say we’re probably upper middle class.  

We grew up with great childhoods but the teenage years is where the wheels started to turn. (I’ll keep it about myself though) I always struggled with social anxiety and sometimes a sense of entitlement that sometimes the world was against me.  I didn’t really have that many friends and most of the ones I did have were douchebags that I have nothing in common with now.  Never had a gf, never had sex.

Now, I’m a 19 year old soon-to-be college sophomore with a 3.6 GPA. but no major declared and no passions to help make my decision.  I’ve only had one job for a month that I had to quit due to some conflicts, and I’ve applied to a few with no luck so far.  

A good thing to actually note is that I’ve started working out and have actually been noticing some results 

But still, I just don’t feel like I’m enough.  I don’t have a huge social circle, I’m not out looking for a girlfriend and potential life partner,  and I don’t feel good about my future work life.

It’s not like they’ve ever called me useless to my face, but if I were in their position i could understand why they’d think that.

Anyone else struggle with this mindset?"
549,Is it weird that I sometimes get emotional when people are kind to me?,"Hi,

I do not have any diagnosed mental health conditions or anything, but I do face a lot of insecurities about myself and have not lived in the most stable of households. I am a college student now, but in high school this started, that sometimes when teachers/random people especially are nice to me, I get really emotional. 

I was reminded about this because I had to go to the hospital the other day (I am okay!) and the nurses were just so nice to be when I felt like they did not need to be. When I got home later that day and the next day, I was just thinking about it and it made me really emotional almost to tears that they were just really nice to me. This same thing has happened to me when teachers or friends go out of their way to say something nice to me.

Do other people do this? Is there an explanation as to why I feel this way? I am just curious - thank you &lt;3"

551,No title,"Everyday...is so same. I sit in this room on the bed on the internet all day long, hoping that someone in the family needs something from the store, or from somewhere outside of this miserable existence. 

I am neither happy nor sad right now. Not angry or upset. Just...  


Nothing.  


I feel nothing. It is weird, but okay I guess.  


I am sitting here doing nothing, and feeling nothing. Going to see our eldest daughter at work (she works at McDonald's) and maybe get a shake. It's something...it is outside.

I don't know why I'm posting. This is stupid. I have nothing to say.  


I am doing nothing. I am feeling nothing. I have nothing to say.  


I wish I could feel."
552,I struggle with social anxiety and have struggle talking to people about it,"Im in high school and my girlfriend and i just recently broke up. Her and i would always talk to each other about how we felt and things we struggled with. She was always there for me when i would get sociallly awkward or uncomfortable. Now i feel like it is hard to talk to people about it. My friends arent the easiest to talk to all the time. It just doesnt feel the same with her not in my life anymore.

Im someone who has never really liked to go out and party or go out in big groups. She was someone who liked to party and drink. I didnt have a problem with it, it just made me very uncomfortable and i would sweat and stutter at parties. She would always help me get out my comfort zone and try new things. Her friends and my friends would always hangout as a big group. There were times i was even uncomfortable and nervous with them. Im afraid im not gonna get invited anywhere any more because im not dating her anymore. I dont have a ton of friends and dont get invited many places. Id only get invited because i was with her. 

I dont go many places and feel left out when i dont get invited. But if i did get invited id be nervous going and wouldnt talk the whole time probably. I dont know why im posting this on here because many people struggle with worse than me. I just want to go to college far away and start a new life with new people. Thanks."
553,I am the happiest I have been in a LOONG time...,"So.... I am bisexual (I like men and women).  I am not out to my parents yet but i have another LGBTQIA+ friend that is out to their parents. I found a website that was selling free pride flags for the entire month of June (pride month) she asked for the website and I gave it to her (https://pridepalace.lgbt/collections/flags for those wondering) she also asked how many you could get per person...  then I asked if she could get me one because I am not out yet (also pride flags are normally 29.99 USD so considering it is free is q but deal) and so I can have one for when I am out.  She replied with, ""That is why I asked how many per person you can get"".  Just to give you a personal perspective on how nice that was, I have been bullied nonstop for about 8 to 9 years and this has been the nicest thing anyone has done for me in these years. DANNY I FUCKING LOVE YOU"
554,Mental Health Disorders,"Hello, 

I’m going through a tough mental disorder. I have visions of something hurting me. I also get voices in my head that tell me things that are well basically evil in nature. Like for example when I read a book I will come across a word and my head associates it with a hateful or awe full word. I also sometimes will think of thoughts about ending up going to a bad place like hell. I don’t want to think this way. In fact I want to think positively. My thoughts race a lot throughout the day. I don’t really know how to seek help. I go to church and try to pray about what is going on with me. But it effects my work. I forgot a bunch of stuff at work the other day and have felt so guilty since. It’s really hard for me to concentrate on things.. I’m not a bad person. I spend a lot of time with my Mother and I don’t really have many friends anymore. 2 years ago my life was a lot different. I traveled the world and was really a happy person. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone out there goes through stuff like this?"
555,Early warning signs?,"I think I just hallucinated a spider crawling across my wall next to me and when I checked there was absolutely nothing, I was sure I saw something.

 Due to this and many things happening before this (mostly auditory hallucinations and paranoia) I have decided to reach out for advice

Recently more than ever I've had thoughts flood my head that my friends dislike me, talk about me behind my back all the time and just take the piss out of me. I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid or what and it's actually scary.

Also lately I've been having short bursts of ringing in my ears for about 4 seconds, not so loud I can't hear but very noticeable.

I also occasionally feel like bugs are crawling on my (I have a really bad phobia of bugs and spiders) so that probably contributes to it.

Any advice would be really helpful right now."
556,I feel way too overwhelmed with everything happening around me and just want to get away from it all,"I'm 20 years old, finished second year of college. Obviously, my second year got cut short because of COVID-19 which absolutely sucked because even though I didn't have to stay in my city for school I had to stay to work my job in retail. My roommates have all gone home to their families, so I've practically been alone for two months save for the few times that I've had a 3-4 day period off where I can go home to family. Before all this started, I was planning on taking two courses to catch up on my degree path, and am currently taking one course online with another starting in a few weeks. 

Unfortunately, things have just gotten to be too much for me. The store I work at is understaffed, and while I need 30 hours in order to pay my bills, I've been scheduled for nearly 40 instead, while also being asked to change shifts around. Between my commute to work and the 8 hour shifts, I am exhausted and feel absolutely no motivation to do anything. No cooking, no schoolwork, I can barely even find the motivation to open Netflix and put on something mindless to watch. I get home and lie in bed until I go to sleep just to wake up the next morning and go to work again. 

Because of this I've gotten behind in my schoolwork. It's one class, I've only gotten notes written for one and a half of my lectures and have been doing the readings on my lunch breaks at work (which is the only reason I have most of them more or less done, though none of the info has stuck too much). I have a midterm coming up tomorrow that I am not at all prepared for, so I am also freaking out over that.

Over the last few days, I've been in either one of two states: either I'm emotionless and just feel numb to everything (mostly when I'm at work) or I'm crying and trying to calm myself down so that I can either study or get to sleep, but then I can do neither because I get so overworked. When I do get sleep, I wake up exhausted and only get out of bed because I know I literally can't afford to not go to work. 

I don't know how much longer I can take this. I get that there is no concrete idea of when everything will go back to ""normal"" in the world, and even then I don't think my roommates are coming back in the fall since our school will be continuing with online courses at that point. I can't continue working these extreme hours at work, but I can't put it all on my coworkers to take my hours since I know they're all overworked there as well. I just feel stuck and don't know what to do at this point. I'm scared that I'll blow up at something or someone and it'll end very very badly for anyone involved."
557,Do people ever actually get through it?,"People have been telling me for years that this is just a temporary phase and that I'll look back on it as just a low point in my life. That really just seems like bullshit to me, so far life has only gotten worse. At its core I just don't know what I have to carry on for. I'm lonely, my health is getting worse, I'm in a worthless job where I earn next to nothing and everyone hates me. I can't even sleep anymore I just lay in bed trying all these bullshit techniques that aren't meant to help. This post probably reads more like a rant than anything else but I just needed to post it."

I just can't... Sometimes i have this impulsive strong and find someone on tinder or even on Facebook, but, when things turn real and finally can make some new movement, i just panic. All night and day think (in loop) with a huge anxiety about the supost date or some like that. I just breath in peace and without gone insane when i cancel the date, telling the truth or even lie about it.
I really don't want anymore try this kind of contact, relations, but, it's hard to be alone..."

561,"If you miss your meds, do you forget to sleep?","I’ve been on Quetiapine (Seroquel) for about a year now and I’ve noticed that at first it was making me super tired, to the point I’d sleep 3/4 of the day and still be too tired to do anything. 
It’s basically fixed itself now. I still sleep about 11 hours but I feel a lot more awake in general. 

My issue is that if I forget a dose, or If I don’t take them for a couple of days, I just don’t sleep. I don’t feel tired at all. Sleep just isn’t something I think about. I have a ridiculous amount of energy and I kind of feel like I could take on the world.
The thing is, before Quetiapine sleep was super important to me (and when I’m compliant with medication) it was my way of coping/getting through things/something to do instead of SH or worse.

Has/does anybody that’s taking Quetiapine/Seroquel experience the same thing or something similar??"
562,Please tell me I'm not alone in these feelings?!,"I always try my best to be not ignorant about politics. Whether people like or hate it, politics, are the foundation of our society. They are what either gives us our rights or takes them away. And rather than contributing to the problem, I wanna be part of the solution. But I have a history of being a dumb ass. And it's more recently that I've begun to realize how much so. And I can't help the mental cringe. My friend tells me that i'm doing good by reflecting on my actions and behaviors and that the real problem are people who don't. And although I agree with that, I can't help but feel like it's not enough.

How much do I have to experience before I realize I'm wrong about a certain topic? How much harm do I have to cause before realizing what harm I've caused? What if I realize something too late? I don't wanna be the person that claims to be a feminist but is hypocritically pro-life. Although I feel confident regarding some of my beliefs, I can't help this feeling that I'm over all more problematic than anything. As someone that wants to help people for a living(psych major), if that's the situation, I feel like I'm better off dead. Maybe that seems extreme. But I just don't want to cause more harm than good to others. I hope this doesn't sound like some sort of hero-complex. I just don't like seeing people hurt and the idea that I can easily make a terrible remark to someone or choose not to take action when I should have-makes me wanna cry. If anything, the whole George Floyd situation is really making me dwell on this matter a lot.

For the sake of my mental health, I just wanna know-has anyone else ever felt this way? And if so, is there anyway to not mentally beat yourself up over it? I've been doing a whole lot of that these days and it feels impossible to stop. It doesn't help that I also think I deserve to feel like this since I also feel -I am in fact very ignorant. Like no matter how much I reflect, I will always come to the wrong conclusion and thus, remain problematic."
563,"I've had this issue since I was a child, and now its affecting my quality of life","Ever since I was little, Ive had trouble with forming attachment to the right things. Not just attachment, also feeling remorse or guilt for things I do to whatever I didn't feel attachment to. So, being violent with other kids didn't bother me, but I was afraid if I didn't sleep with all of my stuffed toys in the bed that the ones who weren't in the bed would be sad. I also became very attached to a blanket when I was little. Anytime I was separated from it, it triggered horrifyingly gruesome night terrors (which I'm now prone to) that were so detailed and violent that no child should ever have been able to imagine those things. They started the first time around the age of 4. Now, I know that sounds like normal kid stuff, but I'm an adult now. I shouldn't be having that issue. It's causing me problems, I enjoy watching movies/shows and reading books but I usually end up getting very attached to characters. It feels too real for me. It's like it haunts me. I can't tell you how many times I've become horribly depressed after finishing a show/losing characters/etc. It gets to the point where I can't bring myself to get out of bed, I don't want to eat, I've even been in such a bad spot a few times that I considered suicide. It's crazy, and no matter what I say to myself or what I do I can't stop those feelings. It's like I can't even control my own brain and it's scary. I don't know what to do about it. I can't seem to find the right combination of words to search on Google, I haven't found anything like this. What do I do? How do I fix this?

564,My girlfriend suffers a lot from depression and ptsd and I need help,"This will probably be a very long post but please I really need your help. (By the way sorry english is not my primary language)

I (M/23)was born in a pretty high class familly, very loving childhood, private school, many friends, good relationship with my parents. 

My girlfriend (21), that I met 6 months ago, on the other hand was from a very poor familly, her parents were violent with her, never cared for her, didnt go to her graduation, didnt celebrate her birthday etc, she got bullied in school, she started terapy at 13 years old because one of her teacher saw that she was selfharming. At 15 she got sexually abused by a guy at a party and most of her few friends didnt believe her, and at 19 her bestfriend commited suicide. Bascially, there are a lot of injustices that she never asked for that happened to her and altho she seems ok now, she still suffer a whole lot and is very unstable... (which I understand completely)

When we started dating, she told me about all of those things and I quickly realized she needed someone to be there for her and that maybe she couldn't really be there for me (I'll explain later) and  I'm really trying my best to be the perfect boyfriend.

So for the last 6 months, everytime something bad happened to her.. as little as being late for work or me being too much on my cellphone one night... you know stuff that most people would just go ""ah it sucks but it happens, whatever""... she really overreacts to those things

When I say overreact it's like she would cry about it for hours and the couple next days she will be pretty mean with me and my reaction was always to be there for her and understanding.

The thing is... as time goes on... I realize that I need someone to listen to me too, and I also need support from my partner but she just can't.

If she does something not so nice to me (which happens a lot and most of the time for no reason at all) and I'm not happy about it and I tell her. She will cry for hours telling me how bad of a girlfriend she is, how much her life is a mess and that she wants to kill herself. 

For example, today she told me she wanted to go to a friends house have some drinks and I wasnt too happy about it because she knows I have severe asthma and that it would be very bad if I get Covid-19 (This friend specifically lives in the worst neighborhood in the city for Covid and always invites friends over and just doesn't care at all for the virus). So I wasnt too happy about it and told her that if I was in her shoes I would do everything possible to limit my exposure to the virus to protect her.

Her reaction was crying for hours... and then she proceded to tell me how f*cked up her life was and that her parents don't love her and that she misses her friend who killed himself... while most people would just go ""You're right I'm sorry""

So obviously I felt like shit telling her how I felt so I decided to cook an amazing dinner for her and when I was done cooking she told
me it wasn't how she likes it...

So the problem I have is that I'm starting to struggle a lot being there for her emotionally because it's just too much. Even when I step on my own emotion and decide to suck it up and do everything in my power to make her happy... it's never enough....

And it's not like she doesn't know... she tells me all the time how bad of a girlfriend she is for being ungrateful when I do stuff for her and she really hates herself for reacting that way... but she's just too depressed and hurt by her past...

I just don't know what to do anymore, she went to terapy for 6 years and says it didnt help... which I doubt but I can't force her to go... I know she's a good person she's just not there mentally and emotionally, she's too hurt.

Anyone who struggles with depression or ptsd from childhood got any tips for me? I really love her and want to help her get through it but I feel powerless."
565,I don’t know where else to put this but I think I’m going insane and I need some help,I don’t have a history with mental illness or anything but last night I remembered something. It felt very very real and I can’t shake it. It was more of bits and pieces of this event that doesn’t make any sense and I know I sound absolutely insane right now but it was a memory of me being on some super crazy drug that I didn’t realize I was on that basically sent me to another world it was very scattered but I’m worried that I’m on it now and that nothing is real. I know that sounds crazy and I don’t believe it but it’s really fucking eating away at me. I don’t know if it was a fever dream I remembered or if it’s some sort of mental illness or it’s actually true. It’s really fucking bothering me because I don’t know what to do. I can’t tel anyone about this Because then Every one will think I’m crazy. I’m really just looking for a logical explanation to all this if anyone could help that would be much appreciated.
566,No diagnosis but im on medication.,"I've been on citalopram for over a year now, and on propranolol for about 6 months. The counsellor from my college is the only person to ever get these things done for me.

My issue is, I dont just want medication,  hell I don't even really want medication. I want a diagnosis. If there is anything that is. I just want to know!

I know someone who was lucky enough to pay for a therapist in order to get a diagnosis. I dont have that money, my mother doesn't have that money. But I want it so bad I've been living like this wondering what the hell is wrong with me for so long. I judt want closure.

Tl;Dr.
Does anyone know how i can get a possible diagnosis? Please. Its all i want, I just want to feel like my feelings are real. I want validation."
567,Who wants to talk?,"I’m going to sleep soon but I’m lonely. I’m afraid I’ll wake up having a panic attack like yesterday, I’m starting to be afraid to be by myself like I used to be. Just worried I’ll drive myself crazy"
568,Why can’t I look people in the eyes?,Does this happen to anyone else? Like I can not look people in the eyes as it is super uncomfortable. I feel they will see all my insecurities or that I’m somehow less than them and I don’t deserve their attention. I assume it has something to do with my mental health...anxiety perhaps? Just seeing if it’s common for others too.
569,I think about suicide a lot,"I was in therapy for like 5 or 6 months something like that and it didn't help (with 3 different people) because I couldn't open up. I never really can open up about myself (like, even music I listen to, much less emotions, like my last gf we dated for 4 months i felt uncomfortable around even though she did nothing to warrant that). Also I feel bad because I've always had a hard time getting gifts, like I went to the store to get my mom a mothers day gift &amp; card but I ended up not doing it (even though i went to the aisle and even check out with something else) cause of people being around. I don't talk to people much because I say stupid edgy shit when I'm nervous sometimes, it's costed me friendships in the past and it's embarrassing for me so a lot of the time I just kinda avoid that person, also why I avoid new people. I've attempted suicide in the past and I've called hotlines and whatever but for me in whatever moment it's not like I have a reason, usually I feel peaceful if I cry it's usually me kinda debating with myself how I wanna be remembered (like i've written out entire notes before and also little jokes like ""oops i was just trying to learn how to tie a knot"" on a whiteboard in my room and i'm kinda in a light-hearted kind of mood so it makes me laugh a little). Overall though I've been mostly unsuccessful because I don't wanna leave a mess or a traumatic image in whatever family member finds me (so no like guns or hanging or foaming at the mouth type shit) but the closest was when I od'd on a bunch of medications but got saved."
570,Riots are making it worse,These riots are really taking a toll on my depression/ anxiety and something’s telling me this is different than the riots before. Like somethings going on that they’re not telling us MORE than to usual. But idk the paranoia could be increased with all this. It’s just scary to think the military is going to be patrolling the streets
571,Challenge Day,"Did anyone else get to experience the surreal, Oprah-esk group event where they rangle up children of different ages from a school, put them together and ask them to share their deepest secrets, worst experiences and fears? Did anyone have a memorable experience? Good? Terrible? 

Many people who I've talked to about challenge day oddly enough either don't remember much it, or, what they do remember was invasive.

My own was rather unique. I, a male, ended up opening up in a share group surrounded by girls, with my old kindergarten teacher as the adult voice. I was one of those at the cross the line section who seemed to be on the wrong side of the line, everytime. Suicide, no childhood, done drugs, involuntary sexual acts.

This same teacher, once i opened up my feelings about my childhood molestation and my part in furthering and eventual attempting to stop the cycle, got me alone and used police interrogation tactics, my irrational fear of jail, my suicidal proclivity &amp; shame to manipulate a confession out of who i felt i had harmed the way i had been.

She then conducted a witch hunt, starting with that boy, using me to tell him it was ok to talk to her, finding out whom he had fooled around with, and so on with others. She wss making a list of names. 

It wasn't until she stated asking me about younger family members that i learned she was targeting these other kids for having simply having learned how to masturbate and laying that at my feet as a scapegoat to shame them as well. 

I know finally broke free of her mind games at that and i got other adults involved. Decpite having cornered, graded, threatened public humiliation and exposing and exploiting the vulnerability of myself and other children - to this day i don't think anything came from her manhunt except that she was asked to leave. 

I don't remember much after that expecpt worrying about my fate once she told my extremely homophobic family. To be honest, i had repressed this memory for a long time. I remember talking to the other adults after she was asked to leave. I couldn't understand how someone as skilled s manipulation, with such a specific agenda geared against my worst fears, could have possibly been there unless the event staff intended for her to be there. 

As far as i know, she went back to teaching the next day and may have since."
572,Aggressive sibiling with bipolar and diabetes.,"Hello I live in California.

Hoping for some advice from strangers!

My sibiling is an adult who has severe mental problems. Because of this I am moving out of my parents home in a month. He has gotten to a point of complete loss of rationality and reason. I believe this is a combination of weed, shrooms, alcohol, poor managment of diabetes, and poor managment of perscription drugs. And whatever else I don't know about.

When my sibling talks, the conversation goes rapidly of course from one subject to another, and often explains things in a way that doesn't make any sense. By the end of almost every conversation, my sibling has either broken something or and screamed/cursed his way all the way out of the house, into his car, to some place, hours away, for days on in. Often running out of gas. Another time throwing is phone in a lake. Another timer breaking his windshield. Many times ""losing"" his meds.

We as a family know the ins and outs of how to treat someone with mental illness.

Here's my issue. He can't take care of himself. He doesn't take his meds when he is suppose to. He has started to stop wearing his pump for his diabetes (all of a sudden he's doing shots in his arms). With his meds he's not suppose to take alcohol, but he does (he is of age). He is an adult and has a very large vehicle in his name. Often drinking and leaving for days in said vehicle. He poses a danger to himself and others. Threatening to kill himself and others multiple times. It is at a point of not if, but when, will someone get hurt?

He has been 51/50'd a few times, always get released. My sibling basically terrorizes my parents, and my parents don't (maybe can't?) kick him out because he can't take care of himself. So they feel as though he will die as a direct result. And we can't force him into care, as he is an adult and doesn't think he needs it himself/doesn't want help.

I am moving out soon, but I am still worried for my parents safety. As I know this is going to blow over in some deadly/dangerous fashion. I am also concerned for my own safety while still here, but I am stronger and have defensive tools on me at all times.

I am not running away from/afraid of him, I want to focus on becoming a firefighter and be able to have my girlfriend over.

Any and all advice is welcome.

Thank you for reading."
573,Help me choose a right therapist. Possibly sexual trauma,"I have never done a therapy so don't know much about it. My wife accused me of pedophilia 4 times already. I absolutely have no sexual feeling towards minors. I love our child immensely and would never hurt him. This is devastating to hear from her, I cannot stay alone with our son as I fear she will think I abuse him now. 

I asked her to attend a couples therapy and she agreed. I asked her if she was abused as a child she said that she cannot remember anything like that but it might be suppressed.

It's very hurtful having this mistrust from a partner and not being able to be affectionate with my own on in a fear of how she might interpret hugging etc

What kind of therapist should I look for? The one specialises in sexual abuse and traumas?

And can you recommend an app or just a therapist who can do online sessions?"
574,Confused on an emotion,"Hey all I have a super weird question. I am 21 years old and only found out about depression and anxiety when I was diagnosed at 19. I am quite sheltered and have conservative parents. So I'm not too up to date on terms and stuff. My question is whenever I get extremely sad at one point I just go numb. I don't care about the outcome of things and I don't care about what happens. i could be hysterically crying making an ugly face, make an ugly noise, etc. But when I get to that numbing point I just go straight-faced and am perfectly ok, I could even speak with a clear not broken voice. What is this I'm experiencing?"

My most common one that I’ve had for a while, is if I’m in a car and the window is even slightly cracked open, I’ll have a very strong urge and I’ll think of throwing my phone out the window. It’s weird but it happens so much and the urge is so strong, that I have to put my phone somewhere out of my reach and keep my hands busy with something else, because I’m scared I will actually accidentally throw my phone out the window. 

Ive gottem different intrusive thoughts that regularly come back on a daily basis, and they’re making me avoid things that trigger them. At what point should I be concerned that these are obsessive and not just intrusive thoughts? I don’t think I have OCD or anything like that."
576,I’m paranoid,"I was in a serious car crash this January where I almost died

Since then, all of the insane events of 2020 occurred. Just non-stop bad news one after the other

I even got corona last month

I can’t help but feel like 2020 is the year I die"
577,I can’t do this shit. Not anymore.,"I don’t want any “it’s going to be okay” I don’t want “It’s only a season in your life” I don’t want “you’re not alone in this” bullshit that I’ve been fed and taught. I’m so so done to the point of not knowing what to do with myself, my life, or how to interact with people. Period. I’m not considering suacide (although I have cut) because I’m done and it’s a waste of time to be shitting around with myself only to end it and have all the pain and suffering I previously went through be for nothing. I have awful crying jags and just feel numb or angry other times. I’ve had (well, have) anxiety, depression and PTSD but now the events triggering that shit are gone. For almost two years now. I should be getting better already! Now I’m just numb and in pain constantly but with no reason this time, with no obvious storm causing the pain. There is nothing to wait out. Pain with no reason is the fucking worst torture you can give a person. I don’t know what to do at all. I’m so lost. I’m so lost. I don’t know what to do. I’m overwhelmed with absolutely nothing. I’m stressed when nothing is happening. I snap at friends and family without meaning to. I’m so angry and hurt constantly. I feel so alone. Therapy and meds didn’t work before. Being patient didn’t work before. Being nice and optimistic and trying my best has never worked before. Not to mention if I’m trying to get past the “now” what about when I get my first “real” job? Spend my life working? What am I working towards in the end? What do I even live for? What rewards have I ever had for living except pain? I love my family. I love them so much, and would do anything for my little siblings. They’re so precious to me, the only thing I have. I love them, but as selfish as it sounds, it’s not enough anymore. I don’t feel.... here. I feel so distant and dissatisfied with myself. I feel like a disappointment. I space out and dissociate so hard sometimes that I daydream of whole other universes. It’s like this daydream has a time of its own with real people, I know people there. Even when I’m ‘gone’ things move on. I have real friends. Im happy there. But I’m so quickly reminded that it’s in my head, it hurts to know that I’ve never been that happy or proud of myself. Recently, it I don’t dream anymore though. It’s all gone. I space out to a cold darkness. It hurts. It was all I had. Now, I have absolutely nothing. I’m broke."
578,Feeling guilty,"I didn't post a black square for blackouttuesday because I didn't want to be performative or be perceived as it (because I feel myself thinking that way about others). Now I feel guilty and scared.

I knew it was black out tuesday all day, and I was just starting to learn to be able to use my insta to talk about anti racism and to address how my silence for all these years was a privilege. But it felt performative, even though I know that I am taking steps outside of social media to do more than just repost a few things, it felt like i was doing it thinking the people around me would think ""wow this person specifically has said nothing"" when I shouldn't make this about me. I was trying to get out of my comfort zone of fearing judgment about posting anything outside of my personal life or doing things that I don't normally do (particularly from one person who nitpicks at every thing that I do), yet I'm still falling into it and its shameful. I hear that person's voice half jokingly saying ""oh so you think you're some activist now?"" and it stops me before I do anything. I know I shouldn't care about that but I rely on their judgment and advice a lot. Yesterday the inundation of it all was getting too much and I was getting anxious every time I opened anything, so I told myself I would stop looking.

From not looking and overthinking, I didn't post a black square because I don't want to be performative. I know it means to stand in solidarity, but I knew I would only be doing it to feel better about myself for doing it.

Now I'm afraid people will be looking at my profile later and seeing I didn't post one and judge me for it. And I hate myself for making this about me.

I want to do good without thinking I have to show off what I'm doing, or to think about what it looks like to people who are on the same side, whether I'm doing enough or not"
579,I believe I am going insane,"I have had social problems for quite some time. I do not speak my mind because my mind has entertained thoughts about the non existance of morals for a while now and I believe I would come off as sociopathic. I often sit in my room and wonder what I am doing in relation to other people. I don't understand myself nor do I understand others, and I can't tell how I feel at any given moment. Something has happened to me where I am distrustful or everyone and very anxious.

Primarily my problem though is that I don't know how to interact with others. I have tried to solve these problems with thoughts but I am now so lost in my mind I don't know where I started, where I am, where I am going. There have been multiple times in the past couple weeks and months where I do not know what I am thinking about or why it was relevant or what is happening. I genuinely am starting to think I'm going crazy.

I distrust psychologists because I am concerned they know what is happening and are seeking to manipulate me or prevent me from seeing the truth which I believe is that every man is for himself, yet I often have a pull inside of me to care for others. I distrust this pull. I have read much philosophy and am now lost...not sure of what it is that is wront and have an inability to communicate with others."
580,"28, white male with Autism, anxiety, depression.. no friends and one poor parent.","Since I came out to friends and family about my autism diagnosis, i've had people who've been supportive.. and i've had others who've treated me like I don't exist. My brother and sister don't acknowledge me, they're still angry that I came along.. took mom's attention away from them (they're twins, 15 years older) and her will gets split three ways now. They resent that and can't let it go.. but that's okay.

I've reached a point in my life where I don't mind anymore. The times where i've been misunderstood or downright mentally abused.. it doesn't really shake my foundations like it used to.

When people betray you who should be there for you, when you're the last to know about important family news... it only helps you to grow when it reaches a certain threshold. You pity the ones who mistreat you, you wish them the best.. and meanwhile you focus on building your own thing without the leverage of connections. I'm becoming independent spiritually, emotionally and financially.. and I know that's very rare for someone of my age and position to do.

I could sit here and cry about how it ""isn't fair"" and I could panic about the future but.. I know I have the spirit to handle it alone.

I will get there. Even if I am alone, even if there are tears once a week.. I will survive and I will be happy."
581,Mental Disconnect from Family,"I’ve noticed recently that after graduating college and being fully disconnected from living in my mom/dads household and being away from them, I am starting to feel separated from them. Not only physically, but in my thoughts as well. It’s a type of isolation that I can’t even put into words, and I’m wondering if anyone else has felt this as they grow out of adolescence? It could also have something to do with an extremely painful breakup that happened 1.5 years ago that I’m still not over, as that has sort of pushed me away from extreme closeness with everyone in my life except maybe my sister. 

What’s even worse, is that it feels like no time has really gone by, but the disconnect I feel in the sense of “needing” my mom and dad, certain other friends, is so real...and once I realize it, I get so overwhelmed with emotions and fear for losing them and fear that I’m a psychopath for thinking this way. I fear as time goes on, I get farther away and the likelihood of ever being as close to them as I once was when younger is gone, and it’s heartbreaking and terrifying. I need to identify what this type of feeling is, if it’s even normal, and how I can help change the course...."
582,Help. I’m trying to let my mom know how I feel but she never listens,"I just got into a fight with my mom again. I gotta say. I truly love my mom. And my mom loves me a lot. Since I was young, I never really understood my mother because she would use very very harsh words on me and talk me into guilt trips and I end up feeling like shit. But when I grew up and especially because of quarantine, I came closer to my mother and I talk to her more. But every-time she gets frustrated or  in a negative mood, she will use very harsh words on me. What I mean very harsh words, means super bad and sad phrases, which makes you feel like shit and feels like you don’t deserve to live sometimes. Today, I tried to tell her how I feel when she goes and shits on me, but she literally turned into a stone and pretend that I’m not there. And when it feels like I’m talking to air, I asked her politely if she could respond to me or anything. Then she yelled at me saying that I was lecturing her. How much I tried to tell her that I wasn’t lecturing her, she just felt that I forced her to sit down and hear me lecture her. This happens all the time. I try my best to be a good daughter but it’s getting harder and harder every-time she hurts me with her sharp tongue. I think I’m going through depression especially every time she does her guilt trip on me, I feel like shit and I thought of suicide(which I know i shouldn’t be thinking like that). I just need some advice."
583,"28, Autistic, unemployed and my narcissistic family ignores my existence","Since I came out to friends and family about my autism diagnosis, i've had people who've been supportive.. and i've had others who've treated me like I don't exist.

I've reached a point in my life where I don't mind what people think anymore. The times where i've been misunderstood or downright mentally abused.. it doesn't really shake my foundations like it used to. I'm not numb to it in that PTSD.. stare at the wall kinda way. It's more positive now, stronger.. I can actually laugh with these things in the back of my mind now. I'm getting wise, weather-beaten and my foundations are gaining solidarity. 

When people betray you who should have been there for you... it only helps you to grow when it reaches a certain threshold. It gets hard, you question life. You ask yourself why humans are so cruel to those in need of love. 

But then you learn to pity the ones who mistreat you, you say goodbye and wish them the best.. then you focus on building your own thing without the leverage of connections. I know this is how every non-suicide leaning autistic person must become. I'm becoming independent spiritually, emotionally and financially.. a far cry from the person I was five years ago.

584,I think that I'm having serious trouble with my moods.,"I do not know how to explain myself. I smoked weed to try to escape my feelings. But i don't know what anything is about. I don't like it here and i sometimes hate myself. I think I feel something is wrong with me. Nothing makes sense to me, I don't even know if I should post this. I feel like I've been here forever. I must not be okay, right? I need to stop being: the worst. My mind is not free but like why? I wish i was better. Maybe i just can't be okay. Or i just don't have good foresight. I am overthinking but it doesn't feel that nice. I'm still just trying to find a way to let people help me with life. But i don't feel like i know how to do a lot of these things 19F. idk if i want to hear that what I'm feeling is normal. because sometimes i don't think that it is. Ive been trying to escape with tv the past day and 1/2 but like life is just so unfortunate here and I've always felt crazy to begin with. my mind just sucks. and is great. great and sucks are very close in definition said jerry seinfield. but now I'm just rambling. rambling isn't always bad. I'm high. i need to figure out my shit before i do anything. ffffffffuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkkkk. this is truly better than self pity tho. i don't want to ever feel self pity again but sometimes i do and it makes me feel like such a bad person. goddammit"
585,Let my love charge you,"Yo wassup, I been going thru some hell and I just had the biggest breakthrough yet, now I'm chillen in the heaven of my mind. It's crazy how limited and boxed in I was just earlier tonight. I felt so absolutely existentially empty and numb. But I'm the type to never ever give up on what matters so I started writing my thoughts to see if I could get somewhere and shiiiiit I did get somewhere good.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what brought me from hell to heaven in one realization (its honestly super classic and unoriginal but it feels amazing):

I had been hurt by people, and my defenses were on high at all times. I was deathly afraid of people because of how they can hurt me. I had made a fortress for my soul.

There are times in my life where, I let down my guard by accident, and instantly that energy made me vibrant and people responded to it *really well*. 

While writing &amp; pondering, I realized that **letting my guard down is the only way out of this shit mess I was in**. It got replaced by love that is naturally there, but was stifled by fear.

If you can love a hater, you will be free from hate."
586,To anyone struggling,"I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety most of my life, often dealing with suicidal thoughts and attempts. I won’t get into it, but I know that many of you on here are looking for a reason for hope, not only in your personal struggles but especially during these times. I just want people to know that I am here. We are here. We may not know each other, or ever speak face to face, but I am with you. Suffering from a mental illness or intrusive thoughts is horrible and often the pain is unexplainable. I like to think there is a bond between everyone who deals with this, no matter what it is. I hope everyone who reads this finds the strength inside to keep fighting. If you can’t fight alone, I’m here."
587,Missing my rock (my cat),"It probably sounds stupid, but I really miss my cat.

My family and I have been living in a hotel/with my grandparents for several weeks and will have to until the 25th when our new rent house is ready to move into. Because of this, we were only able to keep our two dogs with us and sent my cat, Fang, to live with my aunt until July. 

Fang has more or less been my rock the past few years. He always keeps me company, comforts me when upset, and sleeps with me at night so I don't have to be alone. Without him, the stress of being practically homeless, and family issues, I've felt especially down. All I really do is play video games and do homework for my summer class. Don't have much to look forward to about the day.

I just want all this moving shit (7th in eight years) to be over with so I can get him back. It's silly how much a cat with a floppy ear and tooth sticking out means to me. 

Can anyone else relate with their pets?"
588,Struggling how to approach a neighbor with down syndrome?,"It's nothing urget, merely me trying to be as polite as I can. 
He's a 40~ year old guy and lives with his mother, who I'm friends with. He's also very kind and warm-hearted; so much so I'd love to get to know him better, only I don't know how to start! 
I end up bouncing between trying not to talk down to him like he's a child and trying not to bring up anything too complex as to not bewilder him, etc... But I think I still end up failing on both fronts. He's also fairly social and tries to talk a lot, but has difficulty pronouncing words, meaning a lot of the time it's up to others to guess what he's saying using context clues. Only, I seem to be just awful at it! (and he's aware of it ;u;)
My struggle is judging just how intelligent he is and how he thinks. There are times he seems extremely lucid, and other times he just fades into the background... It's driving me crazy. Any words of advice to at least have a consistent approach, instead of see-sawing between """" average"""" and """"child""""? 
(and as for asking his mother... Uh. There are some issues with that)"
589,Advice on bring up my mental health to my doctor,"
So about two years ago I brought my mental health specifically how much I worry and how much that affects me to my doctor. I was then referred to a psychologist, not sure if that what their name is, and tried sticking to going to them. They explained I had anxiety never diagnosed me with anything from what I know but was given like worksheets labels Generalized Anxiety. 

Honestly booking appointment and working my schedule to go made me feel overwhelmed so I stopped going. After a couple of weeks or maybe a month and some I did reach out to other counsellors at my college but again faced the same issue. I felt to overwhelmed about booking appointments and how to make it to those appointments. So once again I stopped.

Side note this was within like a year and I didn’t tell my doctor about it. (2018)

I found myself very busy or at least keeping myself busy with work and school. My anxiety was pretty high but I seemed to push past it. A little later like last year 2019 I started working out and it helped my mental health. 

Although I no longer have anxiety and panic attacks, (Still haven’t been given a clear answer of what is what by professionals) I have  noticed that I still have some  that the idea of work overwhelms/terrifies me where I do spiral  (currently unemployed for like a few months before COVID) or small regrets make my brain hate myself and keep me up at night. It does still get pretty bad sometimes although I try to pretend it’s not, even when writing this I am trying to make it sound not too bad because it’s way better than before but I know internally I do need some help to learn how to cope. With Covid19 I am in my head a lot more and can feel the anxiety I have is a lot more than I had thought. 

Anyways I want to bring it up to my doctor and I haven’t done enough research but I want to see my options of low medications so I can feel enough confidence to see someone or just be able to exist without being ridden with worry sometimes. 

Anyways I don’t know how to bring it up to my doctor any advice on how to bring it up or just some thoughts would be helpful. I do live in Canada. 

- I wanted to add that if posting this on here or anything I wrote is incorrect I’ll take it down. I also want to apologize for any incorrect spelling and grammar. 

TLDR: want to bring up my anxiety to my doctor and maybe have medication but not sure how to."
590,Could this affect me,"When I was in kindergarten or something like that, I think I was sexually assaulted but at the time I did not know and was fine with it but for a while I have been having some issues with mental health and wonder if this could mess with me in any way?"
591,"Back in high school, I’ve once masturbated in class and I regret it.","I have a severe case of ocd and anxiety and this worry may be a result of it. I once masturbated in the back of class, during my sophomore year, I didn’t think much of it as I did it through my pocket and didn’t expose myself but now I feel extreme guilt over it and worry about legal ramifications even though this happened four years ago. I have posted this in other locations, to only get deleted and called a troll. I am at wits end, I am desperate for help as it feels like my life is over and only possibly taking my life is left as an option."
592,Mental health book recommendations for kids,"I have a 6-year old daughter. Her father and I live with various mental illnesses. She knows that sometimes I get sad for no reason, and she always gives extra hugs on ""sad days."" She's such a sweetheart. I was suicidal since childhood and I want to educate her on this stuff so we can talk about it and get her help if/when she needs it. I didn't get help as a kid in the 80s, and I'm not going to let my kid suffer like I did.

So I'm looking for books that can help explain this stuff to her. I'm particularly interested in books on depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. And I welcome any advice or other tools that may help.

Thanks and stay safe!"
593,The fear that I'm the embodiment of a bad omen,"This is kind of a vent, because it's 7 am and apparently there's an ebola outbreak in Congo and for some reason my anxiety is doing this fucked up thing again where I'm convinced I am somehow, in some way, the cause of this.

This is how I've felt for years. Its like some sort of anxious narcissism. I'm aware that the world doesn't revolve around me but that doesn't really stop my anxiety from going fucking bonkers everytime I hear something bad has happened. 

At birth, I was literally considered an unlucky child. The youngest of 3, and I somehow managed to land multiple health problems that my siblings avoided. I was abused in all different ways by one of said siblings for years and I think partially abused by my dad in a way; I'm not sure but I'm really scared of him now. My brother didn't receive this abuse from my sister, but did feel more of the brunt of it from my dad, same with my mam. Somehow, some fucking way, because of my birth, I believe I am a bad omen. I was far too fucking unlucky, and should've been dead, but the fact I'm alive is a bad omen. The fact I was abused might have been a case of them trying to stop this bad omen from spreading and I kind of appreciate them for that. They didn't have the guts to kill me themselves, so they wanted to push me to killing myself. Except, even after I tried to do that, I lived.

 Someone, something, wants me alive and I do not think it's a positive figure. I am petrified that some demon latched onto me upon birth and made life a living hell for me and everyone I love. No one would've had to put up with all that shit if I weren't alive.  They wouldn't have to put up with abuse, bullying, self hatred, self harm etc. And them staying with me despite all my anger and cruelty to them just really screams that the demon in alluring them, or is telling them lies about me.

So, with this anxiety, you can probably tell that I'm having a really fucky time right now, with everything that's going on. I'm literally a British 16 year old guy, but somehow, I think I'm the cause of everything going on in this world. Somehow I'm the cause of George Floyd's death. Somehow I spread the corona virus. Somehow I caused the ebola epidemic. Somehow I am the reason for pride fall.

I know, I know. Its fucking dumb. It's inaccurate. But I am so deathly afraid that it's actually true that I'm really starting to convince myself more and more. My birth caused a butterfly effect on this fucking world I'm sure of it.

I'm in tears thinking that this might do some bad too but I have to vent. I want to know if anyone else feels the same."
594,Looking for people to be a part of my documentary,"Hello! My friend and I are creating a documentary on how the events of this year have affected peoples emotional and mental health.

595,Possible OCD?,"So I’m not trying to self diagnose and my therapist already told me that I possibly have OCD regarding some things other than what I’m about to talk about, so I can I get some opinions on this.  So I used to read a ton when I was younger but now I don’t as much cuz now it’s kinda hard to... and I just realized why.  So while I’m reading, I have to click my teeth together/ bite down in a rhythm specific to the sentence and if I don’t do it right then I can’t move on.  I also have to “click” in the back of my throat a certain way when I read the words and if I do it wrong then I have to start over.  Also sometimes I’ll think “I didn’t take in the emotion enough” or “I need to read that again” and then I have to go back a few sentences and start over until it feels right.  Now that I realized I do this it makes it harder to actually enjoy reading cuz when I’m super focused I don’t even realize it and it doesn’t bother me as much.  But yeah... does this sound like OCD or am I just weird.  Also when I’m eating a sandwich or something it has to “feel right” when I’m holding it otherwise it’s uncomfortable to eat."

They never really have hurt themselves or others. They just do dangerous things like scaling a mountain without the proper equipment or they will off road super fast. 

They have a history of abusing psychedelics and even pot. They don't really drink. I just am being very vague about their identity because I don't think they'd be to happy about this post but i cant just call their dr up and tell her about all of this as well as ask questions about their diagnosis.

598,I feel like my whole life is falling apart.,"I feel like my whole life is falling apart

I don't even know anymore. It started out as minor sadness but grew and grew. The depression has gotten really bad. I now routinely have a major depressive episode every 3 months after I get my life back together and break down again. I'm a 15 year old and am literally incapable of doing ANYTHING right now. Life seems so overwhelming and my grades dropped drastically from A's to E's. It fucking sucks man. And my physical health is straight up dog barf and human shit mixed together. I can't get myself to ever exercise and even if I intend to, I just can't. I think to myself everyday that I'm gonna do it today but end up not doing it. Suicidal thoughts come and go but I'm nowhere near suicide. I'm just really tired of being on this shitty fucking planet and idk what to do anymore. I've tried going to a psychologist and she suspected that I have ADHD (ADD), OCD, depression and anxiety but now I have to wait another four months or so for the next meeting (we have very few psychologists where I live and too many people that need help so I have to wait for a VERY LONG time for the next meeting)

I seriously don't know anymore man. Friends are unsympathetic af.

I used to be so organized and used to have a clear vision towards the future but I don't have any motivation or vision anymore. I can't plan my days ahead or or do anything about because of my undiagnosed ADHD or whatever. I can't even focus in school AT ALL so there's legit no dopamine that can be attained. 

Someone... Anyone... Please help me break out of this cage which is my mind."
599,Should I seek therapy?,"
I have always been opposed to therapy for numerous reasons, but mainly because I’m afraid to show vulnerability (19f). 
Both my dad and my sister are Bipolar (dad undiagnosed, sister diagnosed) and I’m pretty sure I don’t have that, but I’ve started to realize I might struggle with anxiety and depression. Not in the way that most people would think because I’m very social, and seem to keep it together. I will have weeks where I’m feeling very confident, but then months where I’m not. I have a very poor inner dialogue with myself. I quit playing sports (I played my whole life until this past year) and I think that did diminish my self esteem because that is what I felt I was best at. I have struggled with addiction issues since I was 15, but rarely do drugs anymore. (Aside from weed and alcohol). I feel like I do have that part of my life under control now, but I am dependent on both of those things to some extent. Sometimes I wish I could avoid social situations all together to not feel anxious all the time. Also, I don’t know if I should label myself as depressed because it’s not like I physically cannot leave bed at times, and in general, I can talk myself off a ledge when I am feeling down.  I make a lot of reckless decisions, and then feel guilty about them and wish I could do better. I kind of live my life in opposite extremes at times.  There is a lot more to it, but this post is already quite lengthy. Mainly, I am just looking to see if i can handle this on my own, or if professional help is necessary. Any advice or thoughts are welcome"
600,The only psych med to ever help me has stopped working. Now what?,"Straight to it: I’ve been on the maximum dose of bupropion (Wellbutrin) for years and it’s basically kept my depression/mood problems at tolerable levels. The past month or so it seems to have stopped working entirely. 

So now what do I do? How do I bring this up to my psychiatrist? Is it situational with the craptastic world we live in and could equalize our or is this my new normal? 

(Full disclosure, I am an American disabled veteran beholden to the VA healthcare system. I suffer chronic pain that is poorly managed due to a training injury, plus some awesome and debilitating GI issues that are also poorly managed) 

It took me years and some pretty nasty (and permanent! Whoo lithium shakes!) side effects of many, many meds to get here. Mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants made me a zombie,  Prozac/Zoloft etc has no effect at all, SSRIs as a group seem to be ineffective. I just want to feel a semblance of normalcy, motivation, and have enough energy to shower and eat daily, and maybe be a loving partner and helpful house spouse. 

I don’t know what I’m asking for exactly, except how best can I navigate this discussion with my provider? I’m terrified she will want me to do the whole list of drugs again to see for herself that they didn’t work (yes my chart lists all of my meds and their failures over the years. But she’s new to me so there’s always a risk of a restart)"
601,"I'm going numb and I miss feeling, even when it was sad to the point where it physically hurt.","I'm not happy, I'm not sad, not anxious, not mad, nothing. I've lost interest in hobbies, I can't motivate myself to finish projects I used to be excited for. Watching media bores me,  music has no effect on me, even though it is the center of my coping and happiness. I'm still having suicidal thoughts, but these are different. I used to just want my pain to end, but know I'm realizing that I won't be missed. I burden my friends and my family doesn't care. I feel like I'm faking it, like how I feel, or rather don't is just for attention. I know it's not, but I still doubt. I've never been diagnosed with anything because I don't tell people. I'm sorry for talking about this stuff to strangers who are just trying to find hope for themselves. I feel empty."
602,Does anybody else get that intense deep feeling of emptiness after watching some movies?,"For the past 5 years, everytime I watch a coming of age, romance comedy, or drama style movie I get this intense and crushing feeling like I'm missing something, or I wish my life had some merit to it, or I wish I could find someone who loves me and just have good life experiences in general. When I was in middle school stranger things had just come out, and after watching them have such interesting lives and Mike and 11s romance I fell into a deep depression for weeks, so envious of their life and comparing it to my own made it seem meaningless. Does anyone else feel this? Or am I just crazy"
603,"I can’t stop having suicidal thoughts, I really need some advice as I have nobody to turn to or talk to:(","I’m going through a really difficult time atm, and I want to know if anybody has been in a similar situation. I have been bullied badly over the past couple of years, to the point now where everyone in my town have been turned against me by the group of people bullying me. Every lad I have spoken to has told me it’s because girls are jealous of me, I’m not trying to toot my own horn, I just really need some advice. It’s like every girl I tried to make friends with really wants a reason to not like me, so I currently have no friends at all. Every time I do anything, and make the slightest mistake everyone jumps down my throat attacking me. I don’t feel like I even want to use social media anymore as it is making me feel so inferior as I feel I cannot post anything without being made fun of in some way. The only people who are actually ever nice to me are boys, but I am in a long term relationship and my boyfriend is really protective of me speaking to boys. At the minute, I feel so ridiculously lonely,  I keep having suicidal thoughts. I have nobody to turn to or speak to. Over this entire lockdown I haven’t had a single person ask me if I’m okay. I know people get bullied for not being good looking,  but I don’t think people realise you get bullied for being pretty too. I have such a hard time making friends as every girl always judges me and finds any excuse to not be my friend. And I just don’t feel I can cope with it anymore, does anyone have any advice? I have this problem regardless of where I go, I constantly get dirty looks and rudeness from random girls I don’t even know. I just have never really heard of anybody talking about this sort of thing, I think people just assume that if you’re pretty everyone will like you, but it is in fact the opposite:( I also have OCD, which means I obsessively think about situations And at the moment I am encapsulated with thoughts about this to the point where I am having migraines most days"

I know that my problems will likely never be fixed, but I recently found myself really happy and motivated. But then school just ruined everythong for me. I literally get panic attacks when in school, and often tear up at the sight of schoolwork. It just makes me feel like a slave, forcing me to do work I don't want to do. My parents are very strict, wich doesn't help at all."
606,"There’s beauty in all of your minds, and I truly hope you all cherish that.","No matter what, you will always be beautiful. What makes you truly beautiful is turning your sadness and anger and all of those feelings into something that can help you and others. That is extremely amazing. Coming here and talking about what’s wrong and getting stuff off your chest can make so many others feel better. Just knowing you’re not alone in all of this is an amazing feeling. To have others understand those hardships and troubles can be so freeing. I hope you can realize if you haven’t already, that you can turn all that hurt into something productive, to help yourself and others as well."
607,Feeling guilty about taking a “mental health day”,"Hello everyone
Does anyone ever feel extremely guilty for taking a day off of work due to mental health reasons? I haven’t done it in about two years, as I’ve been doing pretty well overall, but today is one of these days. When I woke up I just didn’t know how to get up and function so I called in sick. I usually never miss work so, logically, I know that I wouldn’t have to feel that way but I do. Does anyone else get that feeling? I think it wouldn’t make much sense for me to show up and not be able to focus on anything."
608,Teenage years,"Do u ever grow up and look back at your teenage years and think, wow i had ED and i had no idea about that, wow i had anxiety all my life but didnt know what was the feeling at the time

609,Voluntary Admission to the Psych Ward,"I had a question on voluntarily admitting yourself to a mental institution. For quiet some years in my life it has been evident that I am mentally unstable. Yet in the recent years, all through college and now my mental health has deteriorated to the point of getting sent to the emergency room. 

&amp;#x200B;

Through speaking with a therapist for quite some time she came up with the conclusion that I might be Schizoaffective Bipolar. Of course she is not a psychiatrist and I would need to speak with one to be sure. However since i'm not in crisis, I would have to voluntarily admit myself to a mental institution. Through making plans for it with my therapist, I got scared and simply stopped going to sessions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still find myself struggling but managing to get through it but I feel like it's only getting harder.

&amp;#x200B;

And so I was wondering if there's any way possible to speak to a psychiatrist for them to properly diagnose/treat me WITHOUT having to be admitted to a mental institution."
610,i don’t know where else to vent,"   i just had a very unusual experience and i dont have any friends i can talk to. 
   for context, i am currently being treated for depersonalization derealisation but i think there is more happening to me. 
   i was told to do more research on the topic by my therapist because he thinks that i am needing to do self reflections and he cant help me until i do that.
   i was watching a video about dpdr and in the back of my head there was a feeling of wanting to be violent and the feeling of wanting to hurt myself and others. i have a history of self harm but havent touched a blade in in over two years
   all of a sudden i started sobbing uncontrollably and scratching at myself since i dont have any blades in my room.
   i felt like i had no control over my body and i have no idea why i was crying. after a couple minutes of this i started dissociating and felt the feelings fade into the back of my mind again. 
   i don’t know how long it lasted, probably no longer than 5 minutes. but the juxtaposition of feeling extreme and intense emotions to back to the state of numbness that i was at before this happened makes me feel weird
   i dont know what can explain what just happened. i have had many moments of feeling like i was being controlled by outside forces but never have they been like this, most of the time it is things self care things like making me eat."
611,I felt down already but now it’s even worse with recent events.,"After the recent events with George Floyd many cities in the US have started protesting. Some broke out into riots. My city was one of them. Historical landmarks vandalized, Windows broken and stores looted, tear gas and rubber bullets. Before all this I was already feeling busted and blue. But now its the depressing feeling of melancholy and fear. Fear of what will happen next. It feels like I am living in hell. Every bay it seems to only get worse. Every thing good is gone. I am not strong (mentally).
And I just want to curl up into a ball and disappear. I can’t look out a window with out the *Video* playing on the glass. And I cannot escape and when I temporarily do its me destroying my self. Finding how to uses house hold objects to achieve a *Momentary Bliss* ( I never do it because I will most likely be caught but I will most likely end up doing it if I can’t find a way to get happy.). Or me destroying my self with a lack of sleep most I get is like 5 hours instead of my usual 8 or 9. And one of the last thing I do is well... *pleasure myself* to get some split second dopamine. But I do it constantly to the point it destroys me mentally. At this point I feel Broken past repair. And I tell myself “It will get better” but I’m just lying to myself now aren’t I? I just felt like I needed to vent right now and I need to try and sleep considering it’s 3am for me."
612,I’m questioning myself,"I don’t know if it’s normal, but I have an occurrence that happens every now and then that has been something I’ve done my whole life, it’s hard for me to explain but for example the last occurrence I had, I was a little down from things that went down with me and my girl, and when lying in bed my cat put his paw on my arm, and when I moved my arm away he clawed it toward him to bring it closer to him, and I “imagined” or saw it as me getting closer with my girl, then he put his paw on the side of my arm and i thought of it as the relationship getting pushed away.

I have no other way of explaining it, anything helps
I don’t know where to go at this point whether it’s a natural thing or something is seriously wrong."
613,Why do i hate myself so much,I don't know what it is just anytime i mess up or hurt anyone emotionally i just cant stop thinking about it and just want to beat the shit out of myself and i cant forgive myself. The more i think about it the worse i want to hurt myself. I have so much built up anger and i always release it on myself and it just wears me down till i feel like im nothing emotionally and physically
614,Lowest point in a while,"I haven’t felt this terrible in over 3 years. I’ve been staying indoors since the 22nd of March. My boyfriend is out of the country during these times. I’m slowly losing my mind to anxiety, I usually feel too depressed to take care of the chores in my apartment, it’s all too much.

My concerns are nothing compared to what is going on outside in the world. I’m in a very bad spot where my support system is basically non existant. I don’t want to worry my parents, I don’t have any close enough friends to talk about this with, my boyfriend struggles to support me with only words. I’m alone, anxious and I’m afraid of my thoughts.

Trigger warning.

I want to self-harm but I have been clean for the past 4 years. I simply cannot relapse. Yet the thoughts are there and it’s so scary. I’m so alone.

615,Eternity,"Hi. I’ve been struggling with the concept of eternity all my life for as long as I can remember. I don’t know what to do because I know that it is an irrational fear to have. I just can’t shake it. I have panic attacks over this often and It fills me with so much fear to the point where I feel as though I could jump out of my skin and scream or ram my skull into a wall...it’s always the feeling that I can’t ‘grasp’ something or that I just want to ‘get out’. I’ve never felt so much fear and anxiety from something...and i feel so detached when I begin to panic over it. I fear this concept in whether that be dying and being ‘nothing’ forever or dying and even going to a good place like heaven forever and ever and ever. SCARES ME BEYOND BELIEF. my body feels numb rn thinking about it. The only thing that has helped me A LITTLE is instead of thinking of it as an endless loop, thinking of it as constantly moving forward. I’m so afraid of this concept and feel TRAPPED like I want to just wake up from a nightmare. I cannot bare this consuming and overbearing fear and honesty don’t even know what I hope to hear from you guys as I don’t even think others can really “help”...I’m just desperate and don’t know what else to do. Maybe I need a new way of thinking about it? A new mindset? And yes I am aware that we are only mere mortals incapable of grasping a concept like infinity...I just need some way to rid the fear...any way...please."
616,I Think I'm Losing Myself and IDK what to do,"Hey everyone, I am pretty new to reddit and this is my first post, so I'm sorry if it offends or triggers anyone. 

I(F22) used to be an introverted person, I was extroverted when it was required, but I thoroughly enjoyed my alone time. When quarantine was enforced, I thought I'll be alright, because I do like being by myself, and can always keep myself occupied. So during mid-April/early-May I started getting major intrusive unwanted thoughts and started questioning my sexuality, to the point it has started to consume me.   
I currently identify as straight, I questioned myself when I was 16 due to a dream I had where two girls were kissing each other. I never had a dream like that again, all my sexual dreams were about men, and I've always been attracted to men, and have never thought about women in that way. 

Now since all these thoughts started, of what if I am attracted to women, I am unable to think, if I watch something, I keep thinking do I like this girl, do I find her attractive, if I hang out with my friends, I keep thinking, do I have feelings for them, and it's starting to ruin my friendships coz I have started to avoid them a little. 

I used to love watching TV shows, but now I don't find the same joy in it as before, I used to love reading fan-fiction, but now I can't immerse myself in it. I can't focus on anything and I don't find the same peace and relaxation in the things I used to do. Alongside this, because I'm noticing women more than I used to, I'm becoming more and more insecure about my own body and features, and if I am even attractive, especially because I've never been in a relationship and have become overweight, and all of this is building up and driving me insane. 

I wanted to know if anyone else has felt this way and I'm really sorry this is such a long post, I'm just becoming so frustrated. Thank you so much for your help :)"
617,"Im just gonna kill myself instead but i have a lot of intrusive thoughts constantly about hurting other people, destroying property etc","It's not the only problem I have by far and I've said it on here before but I have so much anger at the world. I've become a full-blown misanthrope --  I think just about everyone in the whole world is only self-absorbed, the world is run by greed, and that none of this will ever change no matter what. i live in the United States and I fucking hate it here. Everyone's so fucking stupid and selfish and nobody cares about each other unless something's in it for them or the other person has money. Everything here especially but the world at large too is run by money. If you're not rich you don't matter. 

I wish close to everyone could die and we could limit humanity to like 50 million people worldwide. Let nature take back over, let the endless exploitation of people and the planet for profit stop, let people live in small communities like we're meant to, end capitalism and let us work only to support ourselves and our communities directly rather than just filling billionaires' coffers while the rest of us fight for the scraps. 

I feel like Ted Kaczynski, who I really respect and admire no matter how you feel about that. (I'm way dumber than him though, dude was a bona fide genius). He was too smart for his own good, realized how extreme and unsolvable the worlds' problems were because just nobody gave a shit and money ruled it all and tried to do something about it no matter how extreme. He took off from society and lived on his own just like I want to but I can't. He wasn't insane, he was actually *too* sane and that was what made him do what he did. He couldn't just watch TV and eat fast food to distract himself from the bullshit and I don't care if he sent bombs, he wrote an incredible manifesto and said IF it was published he wouldn't do anything extreme and I believe he meant that. But of course people weren't ready for the truth.

Don't fucking worry though I'm not gonna hurt anyone except myself. Much as I wish people would drop by the billions I'm not gonna hurt anyone else. Just myself.

Yes I've tried therapy, medication, hospitalization even, anything you can name to help myself I've probably tried. I'm beyond help. My anger and depression will never be cured; I've accepted that. If I can't change the world (nobody can) then I'll just leave it. Super simple."
618,Feeling no feelings,"I have always bottled up my emotions eventhough I am a somewhat emotional person. This all went fairly well until my mother tried to commit suicide, I had therapy to process it all as I had PTSD from those events (she tried multiple times and in almost all cases I was the person to guide everything, I called family to inform, made sure my brothers were alright, made sure my mother didn't try anything new  etc.). 

After the therapy I thought I was doing good, but about half a year later I started refusing my emotions. Like I said I used to always bottle up my emotions but I would still be able to let them come out, but now I can't let them out. I had multiple occasions where I could feel the tears building up but when I tried to give into the emotion I just couldn't and wasn't able to cry. 

And besides that I get the idea that my emotions are getting more and more active, like if they want to get out of the bottle I put them in all at the same time. I get physical reactions like a shiver through my body or random muscles that suddenly contract. I also get sudden bursts of emotions that try to come through at random moments, first I could clearly point out the trigger but it seems that I just get it whenever without a trigger. 

It is really freaking me out as I don't want to keep it all bottled up but I fear people will look down on me or want me to explain why I suddenly start crying, but seeing that I am not able to let it come through I guess I don't have to worry about that. But I do want to be able to show it, so if anyone knows what the cause can be or something that I can try to let my emotions show let me know as it is really starting to get in my way of knowing what I feel."
619,Is there something wrong with me...? (1 of...idk how many),"I feel stuck in life... I have for the last 23 or so years of my life... I’m 25 currently.

And I don’t know what life really is, all I know is life has been one huge mess.

It doesn’t help to hear, “Things will get better...” I feel like people don’t really ever get it... 

No, I don’t know that, and no one can be certain things get better, I’ve heard and seen enough, that things sometimes don’t get better.

But everyone hopes and holds on that things will turn up someday. I’m tired of fighting... I want something worth living for.

Relationships are hard and very difficult to maintain, and other people just don’t care or put any amount of effort. I have fear and insecurities that plagues me everyday.

For some reason I’m more restless than I’ve ever been in a very long while... a few more hours and it’s off to work. It hardly pays either. Life has been a living nightmare, I don’t want to die. But I just don’t want to hurt anymore...

Response 
“You’re assuming the worst of me again that I don’t understand and that you know what I’m thinking.  You’re accusing me again of not being a mother or advocating for you.  You’ve decided I am responsible for everyones stuff and feelings., without regards to mine.

621,What's the difference between someone with POCD and someone in denial?,"I'm asking about someone close to me who has gone through a lot of the Pure O subtypes and has landed on this one now. This person never doubted they could be a p until they were 19 and already had HOCD, ROCD and religious OCD. They are ashamed and scared to get the thoughts, to the point where they see one in public and think ""don't think something don't think something"". However, I read that some pedos are ashamed of the thoughts too and don't actually want them and would never act on them, so how is that different to OCD? And that it is possible to be attracted to adults while also being one? What's the difference ? This person has never had a crush on anyone more than a year or 2 younger than them and is adamant it's OCD."

I want to quit my job, but I can’t. 
I can’t cause this would lead to being broke. 

I want to scream but noone cares! 
I want to punch things until my fists bleed. 
I want to scream in their faces but they wouldn’t care and just look at me like I’m a psycho. 
They are constantly standing in my way, constantly doing no-brainer things. 
My boss laughs it off like I am some kind of clown. 

I want to quit but I can’t. 
I got a big intelligence blockade. 
I am not smart enough outside my work, but I’m smart enough to outsmart 80% of my coworkers. 

Who cares anyway ? I’m just a replaceable nothing. 
Who would care if I’d just leave? No one. 
Everywork I’m in people tend to be jerks. 
It’s pissing me off. 
I am the asshole when I’m 5 minutes off work to just relax for a moment but others can sit an hour and even being smiled on by my boss.
„They doing fine job, Boy! Go back to work, hahah“ 
Sure. 

Fuck this shit, I do and do and do and for what?
People whispering and laughing behind my back.

I won’t harm anyone. But I’m constantly thinking of how to easily kill nyself without much or none pain. 

A guillotine? I suck at crafting. Would probably just cut my neck and I would die of bleeding out painfully. 

A shot to the brain? I can’t get any guns cause I don’t know how to get one. And I would probably fail my vital brain and survive it. So fuck this. 

Drowning? Fire? Holy shit no.

Jumping from a skyscraper or out of a plane without parasuit.

Gassing myself in my car.. 

But then I think about everything that keeps me going. And I munch on that shit, swallow it and puke. Same shit day for day. 

Humanity is fucking up my mind. 
Planets parasite, feeding of it. 
I try to avoid news and world information but it’s everywhere. And everyday gets worse. 

No I won’t end my life, there is still a giant flame in me but I often think about how it just solve all my problems at once. Or maybe not.

I don’t go visit a psychodoc. 
No therapists. I won’t harm anyone. 
Because I still have commonsense. 
And harming others won’t solve my problems. 
It just causes more of them. 
I see so many fucked up people who harm and kill and rape. Fuck this shit. 

Fuck humanity. 
Fuck my life."
627,I'm so tired of obsessing over my nose,"When I was 16, I was smoking hookah with my friends. They all stood up and left the garage. My friend was in the back seat of the mustang and he couldn't reach the door. I decided to stand up and close it for him despite the major head rush I had from the hookah. As I was closing the door, I fell forward with the door and collapsed to the ground, completely blacking out. I slammed my face into the back rim of the wheel and woke up in a terrible panic. I had chipped a small part of one of my lower teeth and my nose really hurt. I never wanted to tell my parents what happened when I was young. I now live with a crack in my nose on the right side and a bump in my nose on the left side. I absolutely hate it and I'm always wishing I could go back and not partake in the hookah session.

I'm 22 and I have most definitely told my parents what happened. I almost got plastic surgery when I was 19, but I bailed based on on the preexisting anxiety. I still want to get it done. 

I'm always pressing on my nose with my thumbs and jamming my fingernail into the crack. I know I'm on a compulsive spectrum and having this is a nightmare.

I was fine with how my nose looked before this injury happened. All I would want is the bump and the crack gone. There is nothing wrong with its size despite it being large. I'm so tired of being insecure about my face. I have felt so powerless not going through with this even though it has bothered me for several years and will continue to bother me for the rest of my life unless I do something.

I used to be very insecure about my teeth also. I got braces and now I cannot stop smiling. I feel so good about fixing that issue and I know I would feel better if I got this done."

629,How to stop feeling guilty and forgive oneself?,"Hello.
 So, I'm human. I'm aware of this from an objective POV. And because of that, we make mistakes, and its ok to, as we learn from them. My main problem is that I've done things in the past to other people which I to this day cannot forgive myself for, despite changing completely, learning from those mistakes and never repeating them. I never intended to hurt any of them, it was either a result of my ignorance or mental health issues which I've largely taken care of now. My point is, every time I share these things that I've done with my closest friends and family who are truthful with me, they say that they're not that bad, and that whilst they weren't good in any sense, they are things that can be forgiven. I just feel like every time I try to forgive myself and stop feeling guilty, its me running away from that responsibility I have for having hurt that person, or making excuses so as to avoid the feeling of guilt.
 How does one work on this? I don't necessarily have self esteem issues or anything I don't think, I know who I am and what I can do, but I just feel like the things I've done are things I have to carry with me no matter what, even though I've changed, even though I know that if someone else were to tell me the exact same problems I'd forgive them.
  Thanks in advance."
630,Emotional baggage,"Hi. I don't know how this works, but here I'm. Trying to fit in. I will try to keep it short because I don't want to bore anyone with my gloomy ramblings. 

All my life, I've been very loving and patient towards people. I've loved people immensely with all of my person yet nobody stayed with me. I know everybody is struggling. Life is just like that. It was never supposed to be easy. Nothing lasts. Life is an ephemeral thing. Everything we do is forgotten so quickly like the castles of sand slips into the sea eventually. Feelings fade away. Unacceptable things happen. Yet, life goes on.

Today, I'm completely a dead, cold and numb person. I don't feel anything, not even grief. It has become inevitably a part of my being. I don't talk to anyone. Zero. No friends. No support system. I cannot even share anything with my family either. I was suicidal since my childhood. I've cut myself hundred times. I don't want to live. This existence seems a burden on me. We, humans, are strange. Sometimes, your numbness bothers you more than anything else. I just want to feel like I'm alive, but I'm unable to feel anything. I have kept myself tightly closed in a box which at times suffocates me. Silence is my solace. Life has just changed me drastically. I've nowhere to go to. No safe or happy place.

I'm sorry for the rant. I wish you all the best of everything. Stay strong. Whatever you're going through, it's meant to build you into a better person. Things will get better. You're stronger and more capable than you think. Don't you ever give up on yourself.

Thankyou so much if you've read this piece of shit."
631,"I(17M), am really struggling, and need some advice.","I'm struggling so much to put all of this into words. I'm on constant pain, and just want to cry out to someone. I want someone to hear me, even if it's just a shoulder to cry on.

I'm confused about how I'm feeling most of the time, and my mind is really cloudy. I cant put my thoughts into words, and with as much as I struggle, I feel like I'm making no progress... I fight so damn hard in my mind, and yet... I spent an entire day laying in bed. I cry, but no one ever hears it. 

I'm diagnosed with an anxiety disorder (don't remember exactly what. Either Generalized or Social), and depression.

Just the other week I told my mom that I wanted to die. She came rushing over to my dad's house (that's where I stay), and I broke down crying multiple times... I'm such a pathetic mess. Broken, and useless. I'd been suicidal for a while at this point. That's just when everything broke the surface.

I'm lonely all the time, and I only have 1 friend. Im hurting all the time, and I just want to be like everyone else. Maybe if I wasn't so worthless, people would actually like me... Maybe I would be feeling this way, and maybe... just maybe I'd be lovable to someone. 


For a few months (Jan to Apr), I dated a girl I knew online (same age as me). I broke up with her in mid April, and just cut off contact with her a couple days ago because of the mental, and emotional stress it put onto me. That's not too significant though, I'm happy that I'm finally able to move on. I realize now that that relationship was unhealthy, and how it made me feel like garbage most of the time. I really wasn't happy in that relationship.

I do hope I can find someone right for me in the future. Someone I meet in real life, though. I have some advice of my own here: Don't e-date!!!! Off topic, I know, but regardless that was a big part of my stress, so I thought I should add it.

Thank you to anyone that read this. I'm really feeling hopeless, and I'd appreciate any advice I can get. Love you all!"
632,The Black Dog,I guess if you don't help yourself you'll never get better or change hey? I wish I knew where to start or I wish I knew what worked. Feeling down/low all the time sucks so much and whatever I have tried hasn't really helped at all. Not only that but also feeling tired/mentally exhausted. I always overthink/analyze everything and worst case scenario. I am my own worst critic! Hindsight's a beautiful thing hey?  I'm 23 and still young I guess? Plenty of time to make changes and become a better person but what's the point?  What am I living for? Living for the sake of living.
633,If nothing matters in the end than what is the point of existence?,"I've always been an agnostic atheist but lately I've been taking on more of a nihilistic view of life and it's destroying my ability to enjoy my daily life. Specifically there's one major question that's been really bothering me and I have yet to find an answer.

If it's true that this is our only life and nothing comes after it than what is the point of doing anything in life at all? Sure the events that take place in one's life are absolutely real in the moment but none of it matters at all given enough time. From my point of view if something isn't remembered did it really happen at all? For the most part the only proof I have of my past are the memories temporally stored in my brain. When I don't exist anymore any and all traces of me will forever disappear. There may be others who remember or were impacted by me but sooner than later those individuals will cease to exist as well.  

What I'm trying to say is I don't see the point of existence for any living thing. All life will come to an end eventually like with everything else and it will be all for nothing. I struggle to even enjoy a fun video game or a movie because all I can think of is how none of it matters. Eventually it will be like a never existed in the first place and everything I went through never happened. I've found it impossible to internalize this concept and still find any joy in life."
634,Can someone tell me what sort of attack I'm having?,"Ok, so here's a backstory:
Around a month ago, I was watching TV with my family. I can't remember the context but I answered back go my dad (just in a teenager-ish way) and he full on started shouting at me. I felt this panic in my head and then just started crying and crying, I basically couldn't breathe and my mum needed to lie me on the floor and help me breathe into a paper bag.
I often get very tearful if I have challenge someone in authority, eg. Refunding faulty items.

I thought that was it but today, I've basically woken up with a feeling of absolute dread. I thought I had a temperature but I checked and its only 36.4 C and I've been feeling light headed too. I went about my morning feeling completely unmotivated and so weak I've had to lie down on my bed several times. Then I was just on my phone and the overwhelming urge to cry came back and before I knew it, I was in tears and now I'm writing this post whilst hyperventilating.

I'm not anxious about anything in particular and I don't think I have anxiety because I'm generally fairly outgoing and not insecure. I don't know if it's the whole lockdown situation. I would really appreciate if someone could tell me what they think is happening, or give me some tips on how to feel better :)"
635,"I shared this post on facebook about my anxiety, and I thought i’d share it here too...","With all that’s going on in the world, it feels a little insolent of me to be talking about something like this... But regardless of current affairs, mental health is still so important. I hate to talk about it, in fact it actually makes me cringe a little, and I don’t want anybody to feel as though i’m trying to centre all attention onto myself. I try so hard to just not bring it up but I think it’s wrong that I feel that way. Since I was little, I always remember myself being quite shy and coming across so rudely because I would find it so hard to initiate or carry on conversation - which is still something i’m working on to this day. I’ve always been quite shy and felt bouts of anxiety, but only in the past 2 years has it hit me hard. You never fully understand anxiety until you experience it first hand, as rude as it sounds. You typically tend to associate anxiety with things like fearing public speaking or making a phone call or panic attacks (which in no way am I belittling because they’re also things that I struggle with so badly, but in the grand scheme of things...).  You don’t think about the lack of sleep you get from so badly fearing the terrible nightmares you’re going to have and staying up until 6am crying and giving yourself panic attacks because it seems to be the only way your body knows how to react. You don’t think about the annoying habits you develop like planning your entire day and feeling so bad about yourself if you don’t complete everything, and in the correct order, lists and over-organisation literally takes over my life. You become so obsessive and make yourself feel like such a weirdo, and you’ll try so hard to stop but it seems near impossible. You don’t think about the pinch marks all over your thighs or the broken skin in your mouth from the awkwardness and tension you feel when just having a general conversation with somebody you’re not too close to, and how achey your muscles are by the end of the day because you spend most of your waking hours strained.... You don’t think about the excessive amount of sweating that you experience when making such a small decision, because to you it seems like something so huge; and the panic that the sweating brings because now you’re going to feel embarrassed when somebody points out your sweat marks. You don’t think about how jumpy you become, how somebody walking into a room unknowingly and beginning to speak can send your heart racing, but you’ll just laugh it off because it seems so silly.... The fear of your notifications coming up and wondering what your messages will say, but then also constantly checking your phone and waiting for a response and replying within seconds, or perhaps the complete opposite.... The random outburst of anger and not knowing how to control it but later feeling so bad because it’s nobody else’s fault that you’re feeling this way.... Never being able to fully concentrate.... The constant fucking unbearable headaches.... Trying so hard to turn up absolutely everywhere so unnecessarily early because you can’t stand the idea of someone having to wait for you and growing annoyed.... You’ll often look in the mirror and fucking despise what you see.... Thinking the worst of every situation and being so tired from overthinking all the damn time. Constant trips to the doctors to see if you can change your medication because it just doesn’t seem to be working, and always being a constant cycle of feeling so good for a few weeks and then everything coming and crashing down all at once. But it’s so hard to speak to anybody about it because it just feels like nobody understands, and you spend so much of your life just being unhappy. In recent years i’ve had so many ups and downs with my mental health, but i’m learning to love myself a little more and gradually get over the hatred that I feel towards things that don’t even really matter like my god awful legs and the way my skin flares up so bad, and i’m finally finding my voice. I have to remember that it’s okay to have down days and I should never beat myself up about it, even the happiest people have shitty days and I understand now that it’s not as abnormal as I make myself believe it is. I’m not at all where I want to be yet BUT I have come so far and with such great support around me. Anxiety is so much more than the word itself, and it feels so tiring knowing that it’ll always be there, often you can’t help but blame yourself. But we’re not alone. Mental health affects a vast amount of people and it shouldn’t be such a taboo subject now, it’s not something you should ever feel ashamed about.

Your mind knows exactly what you fear, and it’ll always try and play on that. But please use all of the strength that you can to not let it win. 

I never, ever want anybody to feel alone and i’m always open to helping absolutely anybody that feels they need it. Whilst it may not seem like it, speaking really does help. I can imagine, like myself, so many people are feeling the pressure to use all of this free time to better themselves and it’s okay to do that to an extent... But don’t push yourself too far because you’ll always end up back in square 1 trying too much, too soon."
636,I don't know my own sexuality,"Whenever somebody asks me what I'm into, I immediately say that I'm straight,

1: because it's an easy answer and won't confuse them

2: because being straight seems to be the most socially acceptable answer

but really, I don't fucking know.

I am attracted to female bodies, I can get turned on by them, but I don't actually want to have sex? At least, not right off the bat, because it takes a long time for me to actually want to do anything with them. I don't want to have sex with a guy either. I can admit when a guy is ""hot"" or ""attractive"", but I don't actually feel a sexual attraction towards them.

At the same time, I also feel like I don't like anyone, honestly. I don't think I've ever actually felt romantic, and I've definitely never felt actual love. A lot of it is just me enjoying the attention they're giving me, rather than any actual feelings they may have for me. 

Am I a sexual aromantic or something like that? Straight with attachment issues? I don't know about all these different sexuality terms so if anyone has an idea if it has to do with a specific sexuality, or a mental illness, I'd appreciate an answer.

I have BPD and bipolar disorder (ADHD too, but I feel that's unrelated)."
637,things we don't wanna talk about,"with the ongoing protests going on all around the world people are being all support of the black community but was it always like that? even after so many years of independence why do we need to divide people on the basis of their skin color and fight for the rights of these people? due to these reasons, there are a lot of people especially men who keep quiet and slowly slips into depression coz obviously men are supposed to be strong. why do the crimes against our black community and men, in particular, are not being recognized just coz we are not white enough?

638,What to do,"My earliest memory.. I was about two years old or so and my father is home work during a weekday. He’s smoking a cigar outside “here suck on this to help you become a man” first time I ever smoked. Next one we are on our way to visit my grandparents (fathers side) everything seems okay to me. Ten PM rolls around my mother starts yelling at my father something, something, I’m taking the kids (I have one younger sister.) I cry myself to sleep and way up the next morning in the back seat of the car without my father, just mother and sister. Next memory, I’m about five, I get a new sitter.  She Waves bye to my mother while greeting with a smile, as soon as the door shuts she drags my to the couch by yanking on my ear for the months she “watched me” every morning I new what.. or more like who waits for me. Next, I’m eight my uncle is five years elder than me gives me my first ruthless and unwelcome beating. I tell his mother (who is my grandmother) and I get whipped with a belt for “lying.” This double beating continues for two years and ended when I called my own grandmother a bitch, but still got beat on repeatedly by my uncle till I was fifteen. Next, I’m twelve. I’m falling behind in school. Teacher asks “is someone molesting you at home? Why are you so quiet and distant?” I replied I don’t know. My mother was called in for a parent teacher meeting. Same question was asked, same answer was given. 13.. I was kick out of middle school for cutting class, sleeping, and just lack of involvement in any subject. My mom was home that day. She threw out every article of clothing at the time, yelling at the top of her lungs “get the fuck out you worthless piece of shit, worthless and lazy like your father!” First time attempting suicide, I used a belt and the bunk beds I had at the time, failed. At the point before passing out the belt cane loose.  14, I’m walking home, someone tried to mug me and fractured my jaw. At this point in my life. I have been mistreated my damn near everyone I came in contact with (or so it is perceived in my head) I attended suicide again. 15, I get a call from my father, “I’m finally released from jail son, I’ll be home in thirty minutes.” 45 minutes pass “ I’m sorry I got turned around everything looks so different, I’ll be there in 10 minutes” 1hr later.. “ I’m so sorry I won’t be able to see you today” 16, I was told my father cheated when I was 2 and that what lead to a divorce.  This is the point when my psyche took the hardest impact. I find out I couldn’t trust any single family member. My mother was out of at job and I was told to steal money from her own mother “or else”. When I was 13 I was caught cross dressing by my mother, turns out she couldn’t keep a secret like she promised she would “ like omg I think my son is a fucking fag but he won’t admit it” being called a fagot or gay or a bitch by my mother was a regular thing there after. 17 I graduated high school a whole year and semester ahead of schedule. First time I hear “ I’m proud of you” even so by my mother. Some here on it’s been why aren’t you in College? You think being home is doing shit? Lazy mother fucker. I go back to school for general Ed. Oh what the fuck is that you thing your big and bad and can do what the fuck you want to do? You don’t thing you need a job to help me out after losing my job, having to take care of you guys without your dad yada yada she’s used the same guilt card times before. I quit school to work. Oh you think your shit don’t stink because you got some minimum wage loser job? You don’t think you need an education to be someone? You think this is it? I got fired so I went back to school, this time for computers, I love computers. Look at you! Waisting  fucking money on stupid ass classes that aren’t going to take you anywhere. Get a job and the script well.. rinse and repeat. That s only a portion of my passed I feel like getting out there there’s a ton more.. I’m 27 now. I can only remember my life not as a human but being a scapegoat for others. I was beat up to make an example out of by many people. I wasn’t really anyone’s first pick, just a last resort. I was bullied since I was in the first grade by what seems to me,to be everyone I had came in contact with. Adults... they were the just children that grew up to continue bullying. Remember in class being told “there is no such thing as a stupid question” well every time after hearing that I would feel confident and ask my question to be made fun of, by the whole class and yes my teachers too. My family did the same but.. with name calling. So much of it, I stopped trusting anyone that human. At the same time I became timid and shy. Fast forward to when I was 12 and that’s why my teacher asked if I was molested. My family has been hurting me and my feeling especially for so long that I was angry, so much so I projected all my hated for them onto everyone I met. Randomly, I would have girlfriends here in there. Never failed, when I would open up and finally be vulnerable “omg you’re so sensitive, you just like a girl but a guy” get dumped and repeat till my last relationship three years ago (24 years old) I’m still plagued with suicidal thoughts. 
I don’t have religion To turn to, I was seen as a weirdo for being to depressed for having nothing to be depressed about I stopped believing in religion all together, I read the Bible’s of so many religions that what I pieced together that is the same in every is that the people who suffer will be lifted into the heavens and all evil doers will eventually deal with some day of reckoning. Too bad.. it seems that I’m experiencing some sort of isolated incident. Ugh I lost my train of thought now. I had and still have all this pent up emotions. About 3 years ago when I was driving through downtown, I struck a homeless man crossing the street while I had the right a way, and with the Metro bus being of the left turning lane in the middle of the intersection I didn’t see him crossing with bike. I struck him and killed him. There were so many people that watch that Poor man get flung in the air and hit the ground. I remember being told “why were you going so fast you piece of shit” after the police did their investigation, they ruled it an accident. He didn’t have the right of way and I was not speeding. Killing this man even as an accident really fucked me up some more. After I got a new car.. I was close.. but I chickened out last minute.. I almost drove myself off a cliff. Just about a year ago I started really exploring my sexuality. As in really trying to figure out who I am. At this point I haven’t has sex for about.. 2 years before that it was a couple times in the span of 3 months before that I don’t really remember. My sex drive or lack there of is what made me want to explore. At this point I feel like a woman incased in the flesh of a man. I haven’t seen a therapist due to COVID and I do want some assurance if not some fucking help for a change. Theres a ton more but until I get the courage to post again..."
639,Porn “addiction”,So my girlfriend has major self esteem issues and does not want to seem demanding or needy or anything. She and I have been together for two and a half years and she has mentioned wanting me to stop porn before. I stopped for around a month then went back a few times and then stopped again for around two and a half weeks until today. I do not want her to be upset with me or mad or anything and I know if I tell her she is going to say she does not care but in reality she does and she has told me sometimes she just tells me she does not care to avoid issues. She is sleeping right now and I need to tell her later I just worry and I know it was a conscious decision of mine and it was my fault and I enjoy it in the moment but hate myself for it afterward.
640,Weird squeak noise in head at night?,"So I usually pass out at 10-11 pm but recently I’ve been waking up at 1-2 am and randomly get one squeak noise from what I thought was my inner ear or something. Bought some ear wax cleaner, cleaned the ears, still doing it. I literally just lay in bed, wake up, and hear it 10 to 15 minutes later. I’m not moving or anything. Usually only one time. Never get it during the day, or when about to fall asleep. I’m a light sleeper and always wake up once or twice. This started 4 days ago. 37 m, relatively healthy, have anxiety/depression, ptsd never had any problem like this before. Freaked out thinking I had a bug in my ear. Just looking for some insight before I take it to the next level. Maybe I’m just overthinking."
641,Being alive has never felt less “worth it”,That’s all
642,Being alive has never felt less “worth it”,Just needed to get that off my chest
643,"Please read and help if you can, I think I’m actually going crazy","It started maybe 3 weeks ago, major episodes of depression where I have no idea what to even do with myself. I will wander around the house at 3 in the morning literally choking on tears. I’ll even talk to myself because I just feel so fucking lonely and awful. Fast forward to this morning, I stayed up all night for the second night in a row because of paranoia and now I’m taking a shower. Have to leave to curtain semi open because of panic attacks, and bug start crawling out of the wall. Little tiny bugs. I look at the part of the wall where the shower wall meets it and there’s a dark hole, almost like the shower is coming off of the wall. So I cry and hurry as fast as I can. Next I’m out of the shower and I’m getting some coffee. Coffee tastes awful now. The taste hasn’t changed, I’ve just grown to hate the taste recently. I start to hear low, guttural growls. And hisses. And weird noises. Everything feels not real... it feels like I’m living in some lovecraftian horror story. Like I’m the only real person here. I’m the only real person. My sister is asleep in the couch, my brother in his bed, and my mom is sitting in the kitchen reading her bible drinking coffee but only I’m real. I fucking know someone is watching me. They watch me while I cut myself and they watch me wander around sobbing until me eyes are aching. And they love it and it’s entertaining. I’m going insane and I don’t know what to do. Every time I try and tell my mom she brushes it off later, of course I fucking predicted it because she’s a part of this. And every time I see someone from my family I get angry. It wasn’t like this a week ago. I just get so angry I could punch a wall. If this post gets removed then that’s a sign and I don’t know how much longer I can live like this. Is there a way to bring myself back to reality? Anything I can do at all? Please respond fast"
644,How do I convince someone to get help for depression when they've had bad experiences with pyschologists in the past?,"My mum has depression and possibly some other problems, but she refuses to get any professional help, claiming that she has to learn to get out of it on her own. Despite this, she is, in my opinion getting worse and has taken no steps to understand or change her behavior. 

She has said that the reason she doesn't want to go to a psychologist is because she has been to them in the past and they did not help her, even making her feel worse about herself. 

I am in no way suggesting that getting out of depression is easy. I myself have depression, but I just want to be able to help my mum and I know I can't do it on my own.

Is there anything I can do to convince her to seek help? Although I fear the answer will be no."
645,I've recognise my problems but I dunno where to go from here," I have a very good memory, I could recall memories from way up to 2 yrs old. I'm sort of sensitive to sounds to the point of I memorized all my neighbors footstep sound and could hear much clear than all of my family, so much so that if u were in the next open room based on the sounds I could mostly recognize what ur doin or what ur saying . I'm also emotionally sensitive. So I payed all that out not to brag but so u could understand.

Well as a middle child I've always been left alone to fend for myself. Mom's busy with my older sisters education and taking care of the baby. Dad is away for months. I'm not gonna say that I wasn't taken cared of properly I was being fed bathed properly, but I'm always last on the list, always , sometimes even forgotten. When dad goes home, when I was 2 1/2, Mind you I don't know him well. he started teaching me alphabets which I already learned from playing with the eldest so no need he moved on to name , no need done that. So he moved on to making me spell out words, which is by that time not my forte. I could dictate the letters from written words but could not read that much. That's when shit hits the fan, he gets frustrated easily, first he'd only scare me with his belt payed out. But when I get something wrong he'd tell and call me useless. One time he got so pissed off at me that he'd just outright hit me with the betl. If u cry I'd be hit even harder. Where's my mom u ask? She only told him to stop when she seen the bruises. I was a cry baby so it was normal for her to hear me cry. From that point on I started being scared and untrusting to adults, mostly male adults.

And when I finally started kindergarten my dad even became more strict with me learning basic math. Which is also hard for me so if get a lot of beating. I could say that I was one of the tomboyish girls during that time where I don't really care whine I'd be playing with but when my dad came home beatings started happening again, all I could think when I'm t school is when I get home he'll look at my work and then criticize me again and beat me again 

 It also didn't help that my mom doesn't seem to care, or maybe she's overwhelmed with chores and children but, children ain't dumb, I noticed that she was actually being biased. I tried making her life easier by taking chores my self, simple stuff like sweeping, doing the dishes or if it's simple cooking, by age 4 I could do that. But u see it wasn't enough. I'd only get recognize if another person points it out to her. Like how pretty my drawings are or how I do my chores. Trusting my mom wasn't also easy. She'd always forget about me, this happens many times, I needed like a new notebook or a bag, or shoes, what she'll do is buy what I said I needed for my sister and give me the hand  me downs. I know it happens to siblings. Sometimes she won't get anything for me at all cause it's out of her budget and talk me out onto ""just this month next month I'll buy u what u need"" then she'd forget it next month rinse repeat, until my sister again grows out of her stuff and that's what I'll have while she get new stuff. 1st grade and 1st yr middle school I'd literally have to use my cousins crumbling shoes for 5 months until she said , ur sister is graduating this yr, u can have her old ones next yr. 

And whenever my mom goes out there's always something for the eldest or the youngest. So I cope with that by having all my things used properly, mended my own clothes immediately cause God knows my seamstress mom doesn't have time to fix my clothes, but thanks to that I learned how to read instructions properly and assemble and disassemble machine and diy furniture. If I have new stuff I'd put it away properly just tucked where my sisters can't find it, another skill gained hiding things so my sisters can't find it easily. They'll always get the preferential treatment. It got to a point where if I have the opportunity to get new stuff I'd grab it. Organise , tuck it away immediately. Almost like hoarding. What broke my heart is when the new helper nanny came and discovered my hoard, she gave it to my mom which then she dispersed to my siblings. 

My family would also constantly move to grandma after the parents fight. One time I stepped in to stoop my father smashing a pitcher on my pregnant's moms head he pushed me and then I was the new target of his anger he condescendingly smashed that pitcher repeatedly into my head so many times that it left a dent on my skull after a week of swelling. Ever had a gun pointed at ur face? Well gee my good that surely pointed it to me, he even pulled the trigger, he was just messing around he said.

Wouldn't also help that my dad is emotionally abusive, he'd always tell me that I'm stupid, useless and all bunch of negative stuff about me if there's even a tiny thing he noticed me doing wrong.

This lockdown in my parents house made me remember all of that. Thankfully my dad isn't here. But I could see it again , all the unfairness mom treats me. Now mind you I've made peace with all of those but it still hurts.

Now I'm an greedy, insecure, emotional , paranoid, sensitive,  organized clean freak of an adult . And I'm still struggling with anxiety when i talk to male elderly adults , or people with power in general (like my boss supervisor ECT.) I'm a wreak. My father's negativity also rubbed on me, whenever I apply for a job all I could hear is how useless I am, even in childhood I suffer that. If always pops in my head. Until everything mixes together, to a thought of why am I even alive? Ur mom won't recognize ur accomplishments, ur dad thinks it pathetic, why don't u just kill urself?. I would always cope with that by smiling widely to laughing while crying, i know creepy but it kinda helps I don't remember where I read it but when u smile ur brain also follows being positive. 

These days my only problem is I'm too easily be upset, or annoyed, sometime for even shallow reasons. I don't like being greedy but it manifested again at home, this lockdown my unfair mom would always put the 2youngest daughters first to eat and get what they want. And leave the scraps for me. I baceame a greedy envy field glutton, if I can eat first I will if there's no food left I make one for myself what's bothering me is the quantity. I also gained weight. I don't like becoming a person like this. I don't want to be emotionally hurt again by petty things like this. Help how do I cope with any of my problem? I know this all sounds petty , I'm sorry for bothering. but I think I need more help. I wanted to be a better person for myself. Thanks"
646,Unlovable and desperate,"I’m 28f, will turn 29 this year. I’ve never had a serious relationship and have been told multiple times that I’m ... not good looking enough, let’s put it that way. I feel like I’m absolutely unlovable. However, I’m desperately longing for a relationship. Why would anyone choose me, if there’s a shit ton of fit, pretty, outgoing girls? These thoughts are going over and over again in my head, and destroy even a slightest possibility of me believing in myself. I can’t imagine going on a date, especially after meeting a guy online - pretty sure he’ll be extremely disappointed by the way I look like. While these thoughts are somewhat typical for a teen, I’m an effin grown ass woman. And it still makes me suicidal."

648,MY DEPRESSION HAS BEEN SO SEVERE LATELY and no one knows what to do with me! HELP ME!!!,"So, if someone out there could help me that would be great... anybody... I am a 33year old female diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder, PTSD, ADHD, major depression, acute anxiety, a little over weight but i still get some exersize in. I have had a lot of trama in my life. from alcohol abuse and being a victim of rape and domestic violence. I have been in and out of the phyc wards for about 12 years and even after I got sober and its been years now, I am still ending up in the Hospital for panic attacks and suicidal ideations. Every night I fear of waking up in the morning because I never know how I am going to feel the next day. I haven't experienced joy in my life since I was 17years old. I don't even understand why some people say they love their life because all life has given me is shits and giggles. Yeah I had fun but I really skrewed my brain up. It seems like as I get older it keeps getting worse and worse. I want to be happy so badly and I know I am severely depressed and that I need help... well, I have tried! so fucking hard I've tried. I've been in and out of every possible recovery/mental heath facility, you name it, I have probably tried it. My family has spent a lot of money on doctors/ specialists, but no one knows what to do with me. They just keep passing me from facility to facility. What do i do? Where do i go? Who do i see about this? I need your help. It's a life or death situation. I dont know how much longer I can go on like this. Don't worry I am not going to hurt myself and I know right where the ER is if I need it...(even though the doctors in the ER (no offence) have no idea what psychology is.) I'm just so frustrated and this is just how I feel and I wanted to see if anyone has any advice for me. My brain littaraly feels like its being tortured all day, everyday. I just want to sleep my days away. I am on a bunch of medications for my major depression but nothing works it only makes me tired. My perscribed stimulants do help a little with motivation but I mean I can't work because of this life. They even put me on SSI because I got so bad. Where do I find something other than a stimulant, an anti depressant or drinking to motivate me to enjoy life? Fuck I'm really going crazy here. There has got to be something else I havent tried. Talk/group/ individual/ therapy hasn't worked either... Seriously people, i would never wish this life im living on anyone in the whole world. Even if you were the most evil person, I would not wish what I have to go through everyday on you. Please give me hope that this invisible pain will be over one day soon I hope. I'm sick of lieing to people and telling them I'm ok when I am really not and I just say that so I stop worring people because it just seems to be the best thing for everyone since my parents are getting older and I dont want them to worry about me. Help me #AllLivesMatter"
649,I Feel really bad,"I don't know if this belongs here but I was in the shop today and they made it so no one could pay by cash so the person in front of me couldn't get the stuff he was after I felt bad for him and was gunna offer to pay for his stuff but my anxiety held me back from doing it and im now wondering if he managed to call someone who could pay via card,  I felt like an a**hole when I got in the van as massive wave of guilt hit me as my dad drove away is there away distract myself my from feeling this way as  it will most likely play on my mined for a few days"
650,I feel unloveable.,"As the son of a police officer father and a Bipolar mother, living at home these past few years has been tough. I love them and it’s reciprocated, but I feel like it shouldn’t be. I can’t ever do enough to keep myself feeling like I should be loved. I’ve convinced myself that I only deserve love on days that I do something for others, so I force myself to try and do some good only to at times mess it up and hate myself more than regularly. It’s fucked up to think like that, but I just can’t change it. I’m worthless."
651,Lack of Motivation,"Hi, during my time in high school I felt very motivated to study, I was able to study several hours straight, and I actualy enjoyed it. In my mind, the reason I felt so motivated was because of the goal of enrolling in the best college in my country (Portugal in my case), and I actually managed to get there.

At the beginning of my first year I felt excited, however, shortly after, that excitement ceased and I no longer had the same motivation like I had in high school. The situation got worse with the lockdown because of C0VID-19, plus, I began thinking about changing course and begin again in the first year in another course.

To make such decision, I planned on first completing all the subjects of the first year, than I would make that choice, the problem is, exams are comming, and I fell very unmotivated, I can barely study one hour without interrupting, and I'm increasingly more convinced of changing course.

My questions are. Is it worth it to continue studying knowing that I'm most likely going to start all over again?? How do I keep myself motivated in future situations, while in college??

&amp;#x200B;

PS: I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to make this post, I found the posts of this one very helpful in other things, so I posted it here. If it isn´t, I apologize."
652,Severe lack of concentration,"I basically can hardly concentrate on anything that’s more than a few sentences. Every single time I come across a post or news article I just read the title and send it all to bookmarks. All tweets, youtube video’s, posts, etc. go to either to read or watch later. But then I get so overwhelmed by everything in my bookmarks that I rarely ever revisit. I have hoarding disorder too so it’s easily to have piles and piles of things even online. I used to enjoy books a lot as a child, would finish it in a matter of a few days. Now I go months without reading books. It’s also one of the reasons I quit uni because I simply couldn’t handle it, it felt too overwhelming and I can’t remain focused. Whenever I start something, anything I just can’t seem to finish it and immediately jump to something else. I’ve always wanted to be a translator, subtitler or any of the sort but now mental health has been taken that choice away from me as well. Now I don’t think I have adhd or anything because I wasn’t diagnosed with it but it’s probably a byproduct of my depression, it sucks out all energy from me. I’ve never gotten useful help for it either and not sure how to improve it. It seems to be getting worse. And then my friends and family sometimes send me school stuff to proofread and then I feel guilty for refusing because I have a hard time saying no so I really have to push myself. Even writing this very post took a lot of energy and almost everything I ever try to write will rot in my drafts. Getting back to people seems hard as well."
653,I dont know why I feel this way,[deleted]
654,Is my sister dangerous?,"I've never posted on Reddit before and I'm not even sure that this is the right platform to raise a question like this, but I'm going to give it a go because I'm in need of an answer. 

My sister Erin has attempted suicide at least half a dozen times and has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. My family and I have recently become deeply concerned by some dark signs in her behaviour that indicate to us she could be contemplating doing something to cause serious harm to one of us. Here's a collection of things we've noticed:

* A penchant for stories about **female** murderers (she recently watched a series of documentaries on the subject)
* A book in her room about a **female** murderer (This book was properly, properly gruesome)
* A large kitchen knife concealed in her bedroom drawer
* A tendency to engage in aggressive physical contact with her **female** siblings - the other party unwilling
* A cold, dark stare when she does not get her way (when this happens, she will sort of 'shut down' and go to her bedroom). 
* She appears to lack any compassion or understanding of other's feelings
* She does not appear to experience any true, stable, lasting happiness or positive emotion (she laughs manically and often, but it's a weird sort of amusement that I can't quite explain)
* She will readily, knowingly and repeatedly lie with and without premeditation
* My youngest sibling has stated **she** does not feel safe being alone in a room with her
* When she turned 18 two months ago she instructed her psychologist not to provide any information on her condition or feedback from her sessions with the doctor to her parents
* There are a lot of us (two boys, three girls, Mom &amp; Dad) and we're normally a happy family, but her presence often (though not always) is like a dark cloud on the rest of us 
* Our feelings toward her are such that we are all soon to install locks on our bedroom doors

Many of these things may not seem particularly terrible in and of themselves, but consider this as an aggregate and you may understand that we are very, very concerned - even scared. I'm particularly worried because something else has happened recently that I know will cause her 'evil side' to flair up. She may attempt suicide again, but I really don't want her to hurt or kill someone else. She hurts us all enough psychologically. 

Mom &amp; Dad don't want to ask her to leave the house permanently because we love her of course, she's our flesh and blood. Family. But alas, therein lies the rub. We don't know where to turn.

*My question is, do you think our feelings are justified? Commensurate with her behaviour? Or are we over-thinking all this? I'm not necessarily looking for a specific answer per se, but any well-informed and/or professional thought will be very much appreciated.*

Thank you"

656,Just want to rant,"I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for a while. I think I’ve had anxiety since I was a kid and it just didn’t really surface too much until I started college. I’m stuck at my parent’s house bc of the pandemic and my anxiety and depression have skyrocketed. My mom is one of my major sources of anxiety but in my family, communication is considered disrespectful backtalk and any expression of emoiona is frowned upon. So that leaves me to have to pretend to be happy and outgoing and just generally ok meanwhile I am really suffering. I don’t move into my apartment until mid August and even though that’s a long time from now I’ve been holding onto that. But really even once I’m there I won’t truly be free. What should I do? Does anyone have any words of encouragement or just general advice?

Tl;dr I’m stuck at home feeling incredibly anxious and depressed but there’s nothing I can do about it. Thoughts?"
657,I’m doing so much better!!!,My therapist says I should try to acknowledge my achievements instead of focusing so much on my shortcomings so I’m just gonna brag for a second and I’d love to hear how some of you guys have improved! I’ve always struggled with social phobia and anxiety which led into drug and alcohol problems. My mom passed when I was young and my dad passed my senior year of college which was when I really lost it. I fell deep into drugs and ended up almost failing out of college and went to jail with a pretty serious charge. That was almost 5 years ago and I’m doing so much better! I finally got some help and managed to quit the drugs and started medication to actually help my anxiety instead of just hiding from it. I also got my record expunged and started working in the medical field. I finally got accepted to nursing school this year and I’m doing really well in my program. I also started dating the love of my life and we have an amazing relationship. Sometimes it’s hard to see past our shortcomings but it feels really good to acknowledge how far we’ve come
658,How Did Your Experience Shape You?,"Hi Everyone,

I am currently doing research (paper and presentation) on ACOA for counselling. As an ACOA myself I think it's important to include lived experiences in my presentation rather than just reported stats. If you are comfortable and able, I am wondering if you would share a brief summary of how your experience has impacted you as an adult?

You can include whatever comes to mind, whether its the impact on current relationships, self-esteem, specific barriers, thoughts, feelings, negative or positive. I don't want to lead anyone to share something specific. Please share whatever comes to mind that you think is important for individuals entering the counselling field to know about ACOA. Feel free to leave your contribution in the comment section or send me a private message if this would make you more comfortable.

Additionally, if you are comfortable with me sharing your comment (anonymously) in my presentation please just let me know I have your consent.

Thanks in advance,

Allie"
659,I can't see anything positive in my future anymore,"I know for a fact that it shouldn't be hard for me to look positively towards the future. I'm 18 in a few days, almost guaranteed a place at a good university, I know what I want to do with my life and I have family and friends who I know are there to support me. Yet I really don't see the point in living anymore. 


I've dealt with what most people I've spoken to have said is likely depression since I was 15 (its never been diagnosed and the only counsellor I've seen about it said that I was fine, apparently), but it's never gotten this bad. It feels as if there's nothing to look forward to and that only bad things are going to happen. Any thoughts of the future just fill me with dread and pessimism, nothing else.


I'm really not sure how to help myself. I can't distract myself from any negative thoughts I'm having, they're constantly there at the back of my mind and nothing I seem to do can make them go away, even for a bit."

662,Losing Touch,"I only have a couple of friends. Years ago I disengaged from our larger social circle. I found that I had almost nothing in common with them. Once I stopped using alcohol and hard drugs it became more apparent. 
The past couple of years I find myself reaching out less and less to the two friends I kept in contact with. It's typically a month or more between our engagements. I often think about them but feel unable to reach out to them. It's as if there are two sets of hands on the wheel, so to speak. A part of me wants to maintain these relationships while another part of me feels cold, distant and paralyzed at the thought. It takes so much energy and concentration for me. That energy is dissipating more every month. The same goes for my professional and familial relations. I can't make new connections, can't maintain old connections and have no motivation to do so. I often wonder if I am self-sabotaging. I'm caught in this maelstrom and won't reach for the escape rope."
663,How do I know if I'm bipolar or just a depressed person who is naturally a dumbass when not depressed?,"Like I'll feel depressed for a week or a month then for a week at most I'll have motivation for these 'great' ideas like starting my own business or dropping out of school and moving to a foreign country that I'll get all excited about.

I'll start working on something I'm really excited about for a few days but then I'll suddenly have no motivation to to do anything and think it was stupid to think I could ever do that.

Am I bipolar or do I have depression and just naturally have bad ideas and a lack of follow through?

Sorry if I sound really ignorant."
664,Feeling too much? Looking for help,"So... has anyone ever internally had a surge of an emotion that’s almost too much to control without physically feeling extreme tension? Mine are usually sadness, anger, uncertainty. 
My back and my neck aches because of how tense I am, and it’s exhausting. 
The tension and emotion then leads to a really horrible feeling of disconnectedness from loved ones around me, purely “get. away. from. me”. 
I struggle to talk about how I feel, not because I don’t want to, but because I can’t seem to string the sentence together to explain the feeling without feeling ridiculous.
Throughout a long portion of my life I felt as though whatever I tried to speak up about was dismissed and left me believing my opinion and feelings don’t matter and I’m now finding it difficult to speak up. 
I’m worried that I will push the people close to me away.

I don’t want to feel this way. What do you do to cope with or control these sorts of feelings?"
665,Rant of my life,"Why can't i properly heal from my past, all wounds of everything bad that ever happened to me keeps reopening back as soon as something stress me out so i keep getting back to my old self and mentally regressing to a 6 y/o child as soon as there's an obstacle in my life. I've not been able to cry for 7 years and my mind, memories and personality is so much of a mess and contradictory that professionals do not seem to take me seriously and laugh at my face, so i turn around and pretend that everything's fine. I don't have any friends, even online, it's only a matter of weaks before they starts to ignore and avoid me. Struggling with ADHD, Tourette, crippling anxiety, depression and suffering from psychosis, so i live from a thin disability paycheck. I've never had a job or done anything from my life and i feel like i'll never be able, as a result i have to live with my family that acts heavily toxic thowards me for being such a worthless loser. This world scares me so much, i barely goes outside at all. All i do from my days is playing video games, watch youtube and daydreaming about giving sexual pleasure to fat womans (I subconsciously relate them to a motherly figure). I'm exhausted and so unhappy, it hurts so much like wtf. I genuinely do not understands why it happens, i'm doing all i can to see the light trough the tunnel, but i'm apparantly very weak. I meditate and even studied the law of attraction to improve myself and my life, but no luck, i always come back at the same exact point where i suffer over and over again.."
666,Depressed or Dumb,"I'm 20M. I'm very much interested and passionate in AI, but sometimes I feel too depressed to study anything. All my friends have some kinda internship and I attempted in few places, but didn't get anywhere. Sometimes I feel I'm depressed and this is just a phase, sometimes I feel I'm just dumb and that's why I didn't get any internship. 
I want to cry out loud and share these with someone, but I got no friends and I can't cry either. I've a girlfriend, but she doesn't believe mental health is really an issue. I share anything and she says, ""you've me, why are you still depressed.?"" She gets irritated if I talk more about it so I can't tell her either.
I don't know what I'm expecting from this post. But I felt Reddit is the only place I can share. Thank you for reading. :)"
667,"My depression and anxiety are better, but I'm afraid if they come back?","I'm 28 years old, I've been struggling with depression from a young age and from anxiety in my early 20s, but now I'm much better with both.

The thing is sometimes I'm afraid of what the future will bring and if I will be capable to survive.

My parents are still alive thank God, I do good in life, have good income, apartment and so on, but there is this fear inside me that I might lose everything and be even worse than before.

It was so hard managing to get better - I quit drinking, changed diet, try to exercise moderately as much as I can, because in my early 20s I could barely leave the house due to anxiety.

Right about that time, I left my home because I believed that my relatives caused the problem (maybe true, maybe not), and then I was sleeping on the floor of one almost run-down apartment, and little by little I tried to improve, which was extremely hard at first, but right now I'm pretty content with my life, but this underlying feelings and sadness sometimes are still there and I don't know why.

I didn't had panic attacks for a long time, but today had a little one, which passed quite fast, but it reminded me how weak I was before, and how tough it was to get better, how much struggle it was.

So... today I just feel afraid what will happen in the future. How do you cope with such thoughts when you feel down?"
668,Does this sound like OCD/anxiety or something entirely different?,"My SO is the type of person to overthink everything. He is almost certain he has OCD, he has done online tests, an online therapist said they were almost certain as he met the DSM criteria, but unfortunately he won't be able to receive help in person till August. He had a problem with hoarding as a kid, it used to really annoy his mom. He washes his hands way too much, to the point that they often bleed. He spends 20 minutes a night praying sometimes for fear he'll do it wrong and offend God or that God will punish him or someone else if he forgets to pray for a certain person/cause. He also needs to tap things or lock doors a certain number of times in case something bad happens to me or his family. Rationally he is aware these are illogical, but he is too scared to stop.

He also freaks out that he is in denial about stuff. He suffers intrusive thoughts about being gay/bi and not knowing it, being into incest, being schizophrenic or bipolar, being a pedo and being unaware of it and being unsure if he's in the right relationship any time he notices another woman/celebrity and thinking attraction to anyone else means he's bad. I find it highly unlikely he is somehow all of these things be fears, and he is adamant he is none of them, it's just the fear of ""what if"". I'm not looking for a diagnosis because obviously this is Reddit, but I would like suggestions as to what this is."
669,What exactly makes someone eligible to practice therapy?,"Like, what kinds of degree must they have?"
670,I’m sick of having to see a psychologist.,"There should be resolution to my depression and anxiety after several years, but all it’s produced is failed meds and therapy that hasn’t gone anywhere. I gave two psychologists and multiple psychiatrists a try. I’m sick of trying. I’m almost 30 and my 20s were wasted."
671,I went to the doctor for my anxiety and depression today for the first time,"(F29) I'm not okay. I haven't been okay for months, and I go through spells where I'll not be okay for months at a time, or fine for a year. But right now, I am not okay. Hasn't been this bad for nearly seven years, and it feels like I am losing the people in my life one by one.

I made an appointment and I went to the doctor today to try and get some medication. She was the first person I'd ever told face to face about my suicide attempt in 2013. When she asked the last time I had suicidal thoughts, I had a moment of inner-struggle, trying to decide if I should lie or tell the truth. I stuttered out that it was last week, but there was no plan or anything like that. 

She gave me a daily doze of Celexa/Citalopram, and an as-needed prescription for Propranolol. We did some bloodwork, with results coming in in a few days, to see if there are other factors at work, such as vitamin deficiencies.  After a follow-up in 6 weeks, we will see where I am. She mentioned the possibility of a mood stabilizer at that point. 

The words bipolar were used. Personality disorder. She said we'd look at how I was doing at the 6 week checkup, and discuss further from there.

She said the medication helps most, but for some it does make the problems worse. And I sort of expect that to happen, because I'm just... I'm wrong. I think wrong. I behave wrong. I socialize wrong. I do everything wrong. I am just not wired the way I'm supposed to be.

I've also paid up three months in advance on the online counseling program, BetterHelp. I used it in March and it was great, but I had to stop because I was overwhelmed and finances weren't good. So I have my first session with my new counselor in 30 minutes. 

I don't know how I feel right now. I should be relieved and proud that I finally sought help.. but I don't? I feel broken. I feel like this will probably be pointless."
672,My mental health is going to be the death of me,"I’m exhausted. It took me a long time to be able to talk to my friends and family about the problems going on between my ears and now they are as tired of hearing about it as much as i am. The honeymoon is over. My job my wife my adult life. It’s not new, there is no optimistic feeling of what the future may bring anymore. If I won the lottery it wouldn’t push the cloud out of my point of view, id just dread all the problems that it would bring. I won the birth lottery, my parents are still together and love me. Moneys has been tight before but iv never missed a meal  or a truck note. I married a girl that’s beautiful and smart. I never struggled to make friends. I have traveled more in 25 years of life than a lot have in there entire life. I have a house. A new truck. A business. A family. Even a few friends that still call. I don’t want to kill my self. I don’t want to die. I just don’t want to be anymore. I don’t like who I am. Sometimes it’s abstract and hard to express and sometimes I can write a thousand word essay on why one situation that is the antithesis of “fuck this fuck you and fuck me” sometimes I feel a thousand miles away with no way back and other times I feel like I can’t escape the bullshit that’s flooding my ears and drowning out my cries for help. I feel like if my life was a game It would be on easy mode but my controller has sticky buttons and I skipped the tutorial and I have bad internet and the other players are cheating and I don’t even really like this game and maybe I just suck and keep making excuses. I don’t even know if I can post this here but it’s my wife’s birthday and I don’t want to vent to her anymore she’s already over my issues. This is not me being suicidal I am not going to take my own life...but if I was in a bank and a guy ran in with a gun and said everybody down, I wouldn’t. I’d throw my awkward haven’t been in a fight sense 7th grade self at the guy and as long as no innocent bystander was hurt I’d be happy with any outcome. It would either be over or I would have at least accomplished something on my own."

675,Is there anyone got worse by seeing mental health practitioners like me?,"My main problems are depression and paranoia.
I was desperate so saw many mental health practitioners such as counselors, psychologist and psychiatrists for years.
After some moment, gradually I realized that they only gave me more trauma and stress.
Most them were abusive and judgemental.
Rather supportive but wanted to push me like wanting to make me say I'm ok.

I wouldn't mind working I have tries two different jobs the last year and the first one fired me because I could not function well around people (adhd/depression/anxiety)

And the second job fired me because I could not do heavy lifting ( I was in a severe highway crash age 17 that also left me with chronic pain to this day in lower back and neck and another car accident 2 years ago which I hit my head off the window hard and I think that's where my constant migraine headache has come from)

In my city  the protests have been huge I’ve attended one, and went to see a riot. The protest attended was peaceful but we were still attacked by the state police, i was fortunate to run away before they were able to release tear gas, but I almost didn’t make it. The riot I went to was broken up by police in armored vehicles almost immediately and my friend and I were teargassed even though we were very far away from the rioter and it was clear we weren’t doing anything. My neighborhood at night has been gunshots and teargas canisters for a week. But for some reason the thing that has made me most anxious is seeing posts on social media, and that episode of Its Always Sunny where the gang turns black. Is that really weird?"
681,Quarantine is degrading my mental and emotional health,"Hi. This is a throwaway account. 

My alias is JBujwal99. I'm a freshman in college, and I'm in the midst of my semester now.

I'm seeking some sort of counsel, or anything in general, pertaining to my current mental and emotional health. I don't know if emotional health is covered by this subreddit, but I'm trying anything right now.

I'd like to say I'm a pretty stable guy usually, but that's only because my many insecurities and fears are suppressed by daily, every day life. Like many people, I overthink a lot, which only further strengthens my everlasting insecurities and fears. However, I'm not the best when it comes to keeping it in check.

I feel like this is a silly thing to post about, but I'm ""reaching out"" per say because I need a way to cope with all of this. Quarantine has affected my health immensely because of what little social interaction I get, and now depending on a phone in order to communicate with my friends doesn't help either. Let me just get to the point.

In real life, people would call me an extroverted person who likes to talk with people, make jokes, and just have fun. And I do really, really enjoy those things, but I'm convinced a large part of why I've put up that mask is a coping mechanism for my overthinking. This quarantine has proven to me that, if left alone for long enough with my own thoughts, my overthinking will dig at me, eating away at my mental and emotional health if over a long period of time. I tried to counteract this by the use of social media to connect with new people, and also stay connected to my friends, but I find myself more irrational and more emotional than usual. Social media makes me incredibly angry whenever someone doesn't respond immediately even though I *know* that they're a human, they're not attached to their phone 24/7. I get tired of people way too easily because of small things even though I *know* they're just human and everyone has flaws. I get randomly emotional and irrational at the slightest things that would've never really set me off before.

It's probably good to mention that I also got out of a relationship just a few days before the quarantine began in my country (USA). However, I'd like to say that although I went into a small depression afterwards, I've successfully recovered from it and even learned a few things. 

Continuing on with my overthinking, I do think I've dealt with it reasonably well in the past. I have two best friends out of a small best friend group whom I go to all the time when I'm dealing with things (I already told them about all of this) but all they can do is support me as much as possible. I am thankful for their support. But regardless, my overthinking has still progressed. 

I feel as though I've been in such a low point regarding the degredation of my mental and emotional health since a long time, and I don't know if I'm just being irrationally stupid or if there's something wrong with me or if I'm just not dealing with things properly. 

Please excuse my ignorance about anything. I don't know much about mental or emotional health, but I feel the impacts of it for sure. If there's a name for this or if there's something I can do, please tell me. I'm reaching out for any help that I can. Thank you.

P.S. Sorry if this was just, like, a *mess* of words. I'm kinda just throwing my thoughts out onto the screen. I think I did okay portraying the message, though. Thanks."
682,Calling All Mentally Ill Gamers,
683,How to get my prescriptions without health insurance?,I’ve been on my medications for over a year. In March I lost my health insurance. I don’t have unlimited prescriptions for my medications so I can’t get them refilled and I’m completely out of them. I’m scared I’m gonna spiral without them and I can’t afford to go to a psychiatrist right now. What can I do? Please help
684,Is there a name for this? Looking for others that face the same thing (20F),"Hi,

I have been seeing a therapist for a few months now to work through some insecurities, negative core beliefs about myself, and a few other personal concerns. It is still early on but I have been diagnosed with anxiety and adjustment disorder (from my childhood mostly).

I was going to post this on relationship advice but I thought it's not really about my boyfriend but about me and my emotions/overthinking.

I have always been very emotional, had a lot of insecurities, and am very good at overthinking situations. Recently, it's been affecting my romantic relationship, which is part of the reason I wanted to start therapy.

It usually happens two to three times a month. I'll be a bit insecure or uncertain of some things and either I won't get my way or a sarcastic comment will get to me that usually doesn't bother me, sometimes I'll just be emotionally hypersensitive without being provoked. Then I'll start taking different things that have been said to me or things my boyfriend hasn't done (he's not very emotional or sentimental, so sometimes I compare him to other guys, unfortunately) and putting them together and get myself all emotionally riled up. Which leads to a lot of overthinking and insecurity. Things like not feeling good enough, feeling unloved or forgotten. Feeling like a chore or burden to him. This leads to a lot of tears, sadness, and sometimes I will just isolate myself in bed and other times I'll be very irrational and bombard my boyfriend with calls or texts, trying to get some point across that he doesn't care about me or like me anymore, which isn't true but in the moment I lead myself to believe.

Basically, my extreme overthinking cancels out any good in my relationship for the days that I have these ""nervous breakdowns"" and leads to crying and resentment to my boyfriend when he has done nothing wrong.

Does this only happen to me? Am I having some sort of emotional outburst? Does anyone know what this is called?

I've learned some self-soothing techniques, but I only use them afterward when I'm tired of crying and feeling overwhelmed with my emotions. Often the following day I feel numb and like I don't want to interact with anyone.

I want some perspective on how I can prevent this and stop self-sabotaging my relationship with these outbursts that put my BF through the emotional ringer."
685,"I have these fit, what is this?","So the first time I got one of these ""fits"" that was actually noticed and documented online was about four months ago. I typed in, """"and over"", over and over again for six hours in a venting chat of a friend server on discord. Nobody talked to me, nobody was awake, but I still did it. Before I did it on paper or said it aloud to myself, said or wrote a word or phrase over and over again, or said and wrote things that had no meaning to others, gibberish, now I do it on the computer. I don't copy and paste, I type it all no matter how hard it is to type, and I never mistype it. I don't have the best memory of what happened during this periods, I just remember feeling nothing, I just remember things repeating, not the words I typed, but everything repeated over and over again. 

Eventually I started using the lowercase h more, I typed h over and over again. I changed my username and profile picture as well. h, hhhhhhhhhhhh, hear, and other things. As some profile pictures I used a close up of a chicken behind a cage, a close up of it's wing, I used a bowl of grapes, I used an image of a brown bulletin board with the word hear on it, I used a completely red photo, I used a picture of the old wallpaper, and  I used close ups of objects. I don't know if I change the profile pictures in the middle or not, or the username, I just see the after affects.

The times I have more consciousness and emotion,  I can go from hysterically laughing in joy, to threatening to kill others, to crying and breaking down. It feels like my head is being taken away, like I'm just watching behind a pane of glass. In front of that glass, is mess. A thousand thoughts going wild, but only one action being enforced. I can see everything happening, but I'm not doing it. I am, but my hands are doing it without me telling them to. I can look around and truly think with a clearness I can never achieve, but in front of me is a mess. I can hear it, it's very loud. Like a cafeteria full of small children, you can never grasp any one word or conversation. If I tried though, I might be able to force myself to do something, to break that looping, but I don't feel particularly inclined to do so.

Sometimes other things happen. I go into my kitchen, and open all the cupboards, utilities, and doors, even the one to the garage and the one leading outside, and I stand there. My mom has to shake me and ask me why I did all of it, I say I don't know. I walk through the dark house at night with a knife, or I flick the light on and off for a while until someone realizes and stops me. I just feel, blank the entire time, or when I have slight conscious I feel hysterical.

What is this. This might just be a normal panic attack thing, but I don't think it is. I have panic attacks and these are not anything like them. I feel like my head is slowly dithering away, like life will just collapse. Like maybe I'll just be left alone, in an empty white void. Nothing."
686,My (22m) girlfriend (20f) has suicidal tendencies and I don't know how to help,"So I'll try to keep this short.

I've met my girlfriend almost two years ago and we've been together for over a year and a half. From the start, I knew she had some emotional struggles and here home situation wasn't really a help.

Now and then, she has her moments in which she feels really bad. Normally after a while, a couple of days, sometimes a week or two, things seemed to get better. This time however, it has been the worst yet and I'm really concerned. She says she doesn't know what's making her feel so bad, but I believe it's the sum of multiple cases:

\- firstly, her father died when she was 17, being terminally ill for the last 5 years of his life. She and her family haven't been fully recovered from his death yet. My gf really fears death and the thought I could one day, die as well.

\- she feels really alone in her family. Her mother, grandparents, uncle and his wife all work together in the same family business across the street. they all live next to each other so they almost always eat together during breaks, they travel together, live practically together, ... since she doesn't want to work their after finishing college, this has led to some breach between her and the other members of the family.

\- because the life of her family is busy and mostly centered around the business, life at her home isn't really cosy. She's often alone at home, lunch is prepared by a housemaid and dinner is almost never made, everyone just takes something from the fridge and eats it alone.

\- her relation with her family, and mostly her mother, is really bad. They often fight, and it keeps getting worse. Her mother is often very negative about her, has a lot of commentary and mostly bosses her around instead of actually talking likes persons, instead just giving her jobs and complain about the work she didn't do in the house.

\- at this point, my gf doesn't dare to go downstairs to grab something to eat. She is constantly afraid about someone entering her room, she's startled at the slightest sound of someone comming upstairs, ...

\- what doesn't help is that the last time she was depressed, when she was 16, her family made her break up with her boyfriend, made her delete all social media, changed her from school, refused her to contact her friends for weeks, ... She now fears they will do this again

Basically, my girlfriend is really unhappy at home and it growing apart from her family.

So now she makes remarks as ""I don't want to live anymore,"" ""I want to die,"" ""I need to get out of here,"" ... She also suffers from panic attacks and has heartache whenever stress rises. I'm really concerned and I don't know what to do. She can't even dare to leave her room, let alone reach out to her family. Luckily, a couple of days ago they heard her cry so now they've made a appointment with a psychiatrist, but not even a day later they treat her the same as usual, yelling at her etc.

We live an 2h travel from each other, with corona out and exams on the way, so we can't see each other. Currently I almost facetime with her 24/7, even when we sleep and study.  This is partly so I'm there for her, partly because I don't really trust her to be by herself.

I'm really concerned and don't know what to do. If anyone reads this and has advice, please provide it, I'm happy to hear it."
687,My parents keep on pressuring me...,"I recently graduated high school and I'm about to enter the chapter of my life: college. I dont want to sad arrogant but ive been in the honors list since then until 11th and 12th grade where my mental health hit the ground hard. No one noticed it even my friends. My frequent social media disappearance never bothered them. Ive cut classes more than ever because i felt tired, unmotivated, and heavy. I read online that this is what you call burnout.

While my parents pushed me to the my best even though my efforts are already 100% considering my situation, I felt more down. Nowadays, they kept on saying things that irritates me. It concerns my future career but I wanted not to focus on it. I want to do nothing. I asked them if I can stop for a semester or a year maybe but they disregard that idea easily. With all these things happening around us, I really want to take a rest. I want to sleep peacefully, with no demons lurking in my mind. I want to wake up feeling bright and not wasted. I just want to survive."
688,How to deal with thoughts of your Ex with another man?,"I've had this issue in the past, but never to this extent. My ex (recent) is doing amateur porn. I'm terrified I'll see it on a porn site. I've been prescribed medication for anxiety attacks but it only helps so much. 

The idea of it is stuck in my head. It makes my chest hurt. Sometimes it gets so bad my knees get weak and I stumble. I can't sleep without heavy sedatives and melatonin. I don't know what to do. How do I get this shit out of my head?"
689,What does it sound like my boyfriend has?,"My SO is the type of person to overthink everything. He is almost certain he has OCD, he has done online tests, an online therapist said they were almost certain as he met the DSM criteria, but unfortunately he won't be able to receive help in person till August. He had a problem with hoarding as a kid, it used to really annoy his mom. He washes his hands way too much, to the point that they often bleed. He spends 20 minutes a night praying sometimes for fear he'll do it wrong and offend God or that God will punish him or someone else if he forgets to pray for a certain person/cause. He also needs to tap things or lock doors a certain number of times in case something bad happens to me or his family. Rationally he is aware these are illogical, but he is too scared to stop.

He also freaks out that he is in denial about stuff. He suffers intrusive thoughts about being gay/bi and not knowing it, being into incest, being schizophrenic or bipolar, being a pedo and being unaware of it and being unsure if he's in the right relationship any time he notices another woman/celebrity and thinking attraction to anyone else means he's bad. I find it highly unlikely he is somehow all of these things be fears, and he is adamant he is none of them, it's just the fear of ""what if"". I'm not looking for a diagnosis because obviously this is Reddit, but I would like suggestions as to what this is."
690,I despise myself,"Hello everyone. 29M here.

As the title implies, I don't like myself. At all. I think I started feeling like this during high school with feelings of inadequacy that many people around me were very prone to strengthen every time they had an opportunity.

I don't really know where to start and I don't mean to take too much of your time, so excuse the cringy statement but... there's basically nothing I can do that won't make me feel like some worthless spoiled piece of shit. Even writing this makes me feel like that, my mind is telling me that this subreddit is probably full of people that have had it way harder than me throughout life, therefore I'm an intruder and a spoiled brat that just needs some venting.

I think I've had an easy life. Nothing really bad ever occurred to me outside of the stuff that unfortunately happens to most people (bullying, rejections, etc...). I suspect I've never really managed to get past the inadequacies I felt during my teenage years and now they've grown outside of my control (which is yet another reason to criticize myself, how come I haven't gone past this at 29?)  


I still live with my parents and I am always angry at everything and everyone. Most of the time, if they dare ask something of me I feel like punching a wall and start muttering things I really am ashamed of. I regularly wish my 5 year old niece would just \*\*\* so she would stop interrupting me or making so much noise. Dinner with my parents is bothersome because what the hell am I still doing in this house at 29? Then my father starts chewing with his mouth open and burps and sometimes food falls to the ground and I need to leave because I literally start trembling from anger. As ridiculous as it is, I started a diet a couple months ago just because of my father behaving like a fucking all-consuming machine when he eats, I went from 84 pounds to 77 and intend to keep eating less and less to distance myself from his behavior. That's kind of an irrational logic, I know. Fact is, he works 12 hours a day and that probably makes him hungry. I stay home all the time and therefore don't feel the same. I gave up on my job 4 months ago to become a freelance translator, so now I work from home, though I can't give me any merits for that. I've managed to find some jobs already but my head will never convince itself that this is gonna last, I've just been lucky and I fucking deserve to go back to the office like everybody else. It doesn't matter if I studies languages and actually like what I do now, ""i don't have the right to do this"" and the only reason why I'm doing it is because I was too tired of dealing with people in the office and decided to give up on them instead of making the effort to change things. And yes, I know I've changed things by doing something else and taking risks and whatever, but I sincerely don't think that's enough. I can't explain, my mind will always tell me I'm wrong.

I've tried to change things. Started psychotherapy 2 years ago, then became a member of the Red Cross, then did some giveaways online for charity. Nothing worked. I feel like an intruder in the Cross, they ""are all better than me"", I'm only there because I have no fucking direction in life and should be fucking ashamed of existing. I know what you're thinking, I know that when I criticize myself I'm irrational and only end up saying ""I suck because I suck""... but that sounds very convincing in my head.  There is nothing I can do that won't make me feel like this... let me make one more example, then I'll stop because I don't want this to be too long: 

So, since I'm home and decided to lose weight (remember, just to distance myself from my father), I started walking on the treadmill each day for 2 hours. But hey, I feel ashamed of having a treadmill because my parents bought it for me (it's also very expensive), so I should walk outside to stop thinking about that. But walking outside means wearing clothes. Clothes that mommy will have to wash, because I'm 29 and never even wash my clothes, ofc. So let's go back to the treadmill and wear only underpants for 2 hours (underpants that I will then put on after showering even if they smell because I don't want to give more work to my mother). But walking on a treadmill for 2 hours still makes me feel like a piece of shit. So let's read books while walking. I'm reading Dune right now. It's great and all, but... what the fuck do I need fiction for? Why don't I read stuff that will actually teach me something instead of wasting time with sci-fi? Why don't I read that New Zealand travel guide I bought months ago and still haven't touched? Also why do I waste 2 hours of time walking when I could be helping my mother with the housework? So I could maybe learn how to wash my fucking underpants?

I mentioned New Zealand. I decided to go there for a year (supposedly) to force myself to learn living alone and gain some self-confidence.... maybe after that my head will stop yelling at me?   
I was supposed to leave in 3 days, but then Covid happened and I've had to postpone everything to god knows when. I'm learning to cook in the meantime, but it's not like I have any merits for that. Again, I could save the world tomorrow and still wouldn't stand the sight of my stupid face in the mirror. And the worst thing is don't have a specific reason for that. I just hate it. It's stupid and I would never be so unreasonable when thinking about other people, but that's how it is. 

I'll mention relationships outside of the family now. I have few friends (but that's ok) but don't really get along with most people. They're too different. I get nervous around them, every movement of their face and every word they say can tell me they despise me. There's very few people that don't feel hostile to me. I'm very insecure around everyone, basically.

I'm sorry this was kinda confusing, I will stop here even without mentioning other important stuff. If you managed to read everything up to this point, thank you very much."
691,Feel like I’m too fucked for therapy: TWs galore,"TW: sexual violence &amp; abuse, self-harm, eating disorder, suicide attempt, depression, anxiety, PTSD, autism

For background I’m female, in the UK and I’m 23.

I’ve tried to start counselling a couple of times but I just never really know where to start. How am I supposed to deal with my problems when I have so many and they all affect me in ways I don’t know and can’t explain in a couple of introductory sessions?

Sooooo brief history: very clear signs of autism from nursery &amp; school reports but never diagnosed, sexually groomed online aged 12, bullied aged 11-14, binge-purge mid teens, self harmed 12-16, suicide attempts at 15 &amp; 16, sexually assaulted at 16 and 20, raped at 18 and 19, one of which involved spiking, plus large memory gaps age 5-12 which a psychologist suggested may be related to trauma, which matches up to dates of my ex-stepfather in my life, who I did not get on with but don’t remember any altercations with. After the rape at 19 I had a breakdown, didn’t leave my room at all for three months, dropped out of uni. Restarted uni six months later. Now extending my final year due to crippling anxiety.

I just don’t know where to start getting help. I’m on sertraline and propranolol but I need more help. Can anyone please give me any advice? I know this is a shambles of a post."
692,I have no clue what is wrong with me and neither does my doctor,[deleted]
693,I am exhausted!!,"I am mentally ill, which means even if I get a job, I won't keep it for long, and from my experience, there is a high chance I will relapse in a job than unemployed.

I don't have a social life, neither in real life nor on social media.

I am exhausted mentally, I can't make myself happy not even on my imagination.

I have no future, I am a 32 years old guy but I know after my parents will pass away I will find myself in the street.

all my skills are useless here where I live and above all, I have heavy bad luck as soon as I try to retake my studies and pass the high school diploma and get into a university and get an education on something I can live with, something bad will happen and won't let me do it, it happens to me each year since 2014, each year a different story on how I won't retake the high school diploma.

I don't have a relationship, I never had actually, honestly, I won't lie to you, I need to feel love and being loved and being in bed with someone I love.

I would like to have a meaningful job, and I have some skills, I am logic and I am good at computer programming, but not skilled enough to do any project, I mean not educated enough to do some projects, and as I am not in education I procrastinate all the time.

I speak English, French and I am learning Spanish.

I wrote almost forty thousand words of flash fiction stories and people I share them with likes it.

And I get out rarely from home."
694,Exhausted.,"Hi, so while never formally diagnosed (I probably should have been) I have struggled with my eating habits for over about 6 years. I have done everything from over exercising, attempting  to purge (I could never do it correctly) and restricting. It's been a year since I have allowed myself to eat less than 1000 calories. I used to try to keep it between 300 and 500. And It was going really good. Until it wasn't. Around Christmas I started getting the urge to purge and restrict. I managed to make it through without getting sucked back in. I was doing fine until I started a new job. I switched to working night shift and I sleep through one meal a day and when I wake up I'm not hungry. So I don't want to eat. With this and constantly moving and lifting at my new job, I've noticed I started losing weight. And while completely unintentional, it ignited that little voice in my head that said ""But what if I lost more?"" I know the answer is professional help, but given the situation I'm in that really is not an option. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop wanting to go back. I fully recognize it was an awful time in my life, I was tired, sick and depressed. So why do I still feel the urge to go back to how I was ?"
695,Stop my meds,"I've gone to multiple doctors (including 3 psychiatrists) and one psychologist over the years. 

First, it was some depression and anxiety. Took small doses of anti depressants for a while, which did nothing. The doctor told me to lose weight because I was obese.

Went to university, changed towns, was poor and feeling miserable, spent whole days crying, absolutely sobbing and gasping for air. At this point I had dropped every medication since my doctor told me to only take it for a few months. At the end of the first year, I went to see the university's psychiatrist, my first one. And he treated me beyond shit. Made me weigh myself in front of him and told me that that was my problem. Sent me home with some stuff to help me lose weight. I was devastated and cried the whole time I was there and the rest of the day.

About a year went by, I was still feeling like shit and extremely anxious to go to another psychiatrist given my previous experience. But I ended up doing it.

Went to the second psychiatrist (a family friend), who was very nice and told me to start taking some medication since I was feeling extremely bad about myself. Also told me that losing some weight might do me good, although he didn't say it as violently as the previous one.

The medication helped to some extent but I was still feeling miserable and numb. Just spent a little less time crying like a baby.

A year goes by, always taking the medication. I lose some weight, get a boyfriend, get a nice job, gain the weight back again but now at least I have some money to pay a real professional. I needed to be productive, to be able to focus during my job (being a software developer I feel like it gets impossible some times).

Went to my third psychiatrist, who was clearly well trained but had a very distinct approach. His whole thing was to trigger my problem. So I cried and had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. He never mentioned my weight by the way, I felt like someone finally understood that eating is my comfort and that I'm not depressed because of it (although I admit it doesn't help and can make it worse, but it's not the root of the problem). He told me to increase my medication and to be reevaluated in a few months. I was taking the maximum dosage by this point.

The next part I admit I shouldn't have done. This was about a year ago and I never got reevaluated. I have unlimited access to medication so I just kept taking what he told me (plus a bit of Xanax). Now, the thing is, I'm completely dependent on this shit. If I forget taking them for a day or so, I start crying and it takes me days to recover. If I take them everyday I don't freak out and I'm mostly able to do my job. But I still feel numb, depersonalized, sad, have some suicidal thoughts, anxious, everything. Just not to the point of being completely useless.

Thing is, I hate living like this and depending on these chemicals. I want to be a mom but I can't and don't want to take these pills when I'm pregnant. I want to actually fix this and not just hide behind these pills. I wanna stop taking them but I feel like it would literally make my job impossible and my life unbearable.

How do you handle your mental health and your job at the same time?"
696,Finally taking the right steps!!!,"I have been through A LOT of trauma. I got pregnant when I was 17 by someone very abusive and toxic. I went to school full time, got into another toxic relationship, have had multiple sexual assault cases, and my grandparents died in a house fire on my birthday two years ago. I also had undiagnosed ADHD until about a couple months ago. My last undergrad class ends in three weeks. And I have a therapist appointment to finally deal with all the trauma I have been through since I am finally able to process it all. I am so dang proud of myself and hope this helps me become a better person and better momma"
697,Wtf is wrong with me?,"every now and then I come to the constatation that if I keep this life patern (eating unhealthy, drinking and being a dick to my GF and taking no initiative). is gonna be my death. and I plan on changing everything but the next day Comes and there I am, playing video games and doing nothing to improve my life. I hate myself for the person I am.  just lost my job due to this pandamic and I lost myself once again. Several therapist went by and nothing changes I don't know what to do anymore, the only thing I can is procastinate everything. sorry bit english isn't my first language. just wanted to get this of my chest. sorry."
698,Where does fate lie or does it lie?,"I love my family, my daughter and my wife. But I dont feel like I can make them happy anymore, but it goes both ways. My happiness is based off thier happiness with me and as of late I used to make them proud and that made me happy which in turn made me more happy go lucky and gave them more to smile about. Now I've come to the realization that they all see me as a selfish and inconsiderate because I'm just trying to put a filter on life because I don't like to dwell on sadness and be unhappy about things or life. I like making the most of things, but i also don't lose touch with feeling and being apathetic I listen to everyones problems and put my headspace in thiers to best be of help when I can. All my efforts as of late have me losing my home, my job and having to restart in the midwest. Prior military city boy from Maryland, traveled the world settled down in cali and had to move to Misso. I'm starting to think my early exposure to sex might have something to do with my constant thinking and wanting of it... i was maybe 4-5 yo when it happened and it steadily happened from that point on. I cheated on my wife during her pregnancy and now she won't look at me the same. I promised her I'd never leave her, I'm a man of my word. But damn... im having such a hard time adjusting to the midwest and now I just feel like her roommate. I work my ass off long hours since i left the military at the beginning of the year. And feel like I can't be a good enough husband to her nor make her happy... i don't feel wanted anymore. We love eachother, but we're stuck in a quicksand of love. Always will love eachother, but we're falling apart and neither of us wants to leave the other and we have no clue how to fix things. We've talked to a marriage counselor that hardly helped... Now I'm back thinking about being single and stupid and young, but I won't leave her. I made a promise. What is a man worth without his word? My ambition, my libido, my self esteem and self worth are all in free fall and I just want to die.. I strongly believe and stand against suicide... but man... lately I've felt like im more than deserving of eternal damnation for cheating death if that's what's going to happen... at least then it would hurt... but not forever. Not as bad as having me around as a horrible son,  husband,  father, etc.... im 25 years old and im in something around 80k worth in debt... working agriculture for 10+ hours a day every day now. I'm ok right? Right??"
699,I keep hearing things,"I’m not very good at writing sentences and my grammar isn’t the best but please bear with me.

I am 14 and I often hear things that aren’t actually there. It started about a year ago when I was getting ready for bed and I heard the voice of a man, his voice was a bit higher than usual and he talked as if he were on a cooking show. After this, it didn’t hear anything odd for a while until I started hearing a constant buzzing sound that sounded similar to a phone on silent mode which was really aggravating but I could deal, then I started hearing the voice of my late mother, wasn’t anything odd just her saying my name which was very upsetting if I’m completely honest. 

Since then they have gotten very distressing such as hearing my dad screaming at me for I can’t even remember despite him not even being home at the time, a deep male voice telling me how much he hates me and how exactly he plans on killing me (that one scared me and to be honest with you, I ended up running into the bathroom and crying for at least 10 minutes), and the most recent one was a male and a female voice, I couldn’t really hear what they were saying but it sounded like they were downstairs, I also heard footsteps going up the staircase next to my room. I wouldn’t know if this has anything to do with why I hear things but I got diagnosed with GAD when I was 11 and so hearing what sounded like intruders ended with me locking myself in my room and having an anxiety attack which was very not fun. I tried talking to my father about this but he didn’t believe me and continues to make jokes about it, what should I do?"
700,I want to help my Mom.,"First of all I hope this is a good sub for this post. I need some advice about how to help my Mom deal with an issue that's been bothering her for a little over a year now. Basically this all started around May 2019 when my grandmother passed. The will left some things to my Dad that really pissed off the rest of the family and created a lot of very tense situations. The main issue was the cabin that my grandmother owned and left it to my Dad. And his sister (my aunt) owned a cabin about 100ft away. Now the issue with the will caused all of my Dad's family to fight with each other, especially him. So when my Mom was at my grandmother's house to gather items my aunt lost her shit at my Mom for no apparent reason and ever since that day she hasn't been able to go to our cabin since they are right next door and we actually ended up having to sell the cabin that's been in our family for almost a century because of this tension. There's no chance of our families reuniting. The hole is dug too deep and too much has been said. But that incident where my aunt yelled at my Mom has been traumatizing her ever since. And she frequently mentions having nightmares of her screaming. And she will break down crying every once in a while saying how much it bothers her. I've tried giving her advice along the lines of occupying your mind and focusing on the good not the bad but she still mentioned having another nightmare just last night. I want to be able to help her but idk what to say. I personally don't understand how she can be bothered by this for so long. I've had friends and family I've known my whole life just go away because of a falling out we had and of course it sucks and I think about it from time to time but it doesn't consume my life the way it consumes hers. I just really need some advice as to what I should say to her or what I can get her to do to finally get over this. A grown woman shouldn't be this upset at some bitch yelling at her. Again I don't think her being upset is unreasonable but I think letting it take over her life and restricting her from going to our OWN cabin and causing her to have nightmares is just too much. Sorry if I didn't word this the best. There's a lot going through my mind and I didn't want to drag this on for too long. But I hope it makes enough sense that someone can provide some sort of support. I appreciate any and all answers."
701,My brother’s filmed me in the shower. I think I’m depressed,"Just to start off—I’m not very articulate when it comes to reddit. I’m fairly new and I haven’t used it very much, so honestly I’m not sure if this should be posted in this other subreddit I found (r/offmychest) or here.
To give an explanation to my title...it’s just what it is. My brother, who is 11 years older than me has filmed me in the shower with his phone hidden under our sink. I’m a girl, just to be clear, and I just finished high school. He’s done this to my sisters (I have 2 who are essentially the middle children, 7 and 9 years older than me) and he started with them. I’m pretty sure he’s done many other things as well. I remember waking up one night to him snapping photos of my chest (with his hand lifting my shirt up) in the dark while all of us should’ve been asleep (the four of us shared one bedroom before because our house doesn’t have many rooms and it’s normal for my family to share rooms. Thankfully, we cleared a room so he sleeps there now). I just pretended to be half awake and went back to sleep, rolled to my side and never spoke of it for years. Mind you I was 11. 
I think at this point in time I started to become...fucked up in the head. This was before I found out that he’d done the same things to my sisters as well, and I guess it just stuck to me. My brother is fucked up. And I’m fucked up for accepting it and doing nothing. 
A few years later the three of us (my sisters and I) caught his phone under the sink. That was the first time I found out that I was being filmed in the shower, and that my sisters were victims, too. My reaction to it was...minimal. I felt no emotion. We snuck his phone out, deleted the footage and placed it somewhere he’d find it. I don’t really remember how exactly I felt, but I don’t remember feeling much of anything. Just “so it’s not just pictures”.
That wasn’t the case for long, though. I started to get worried. And gradually, fear and dread grew in me and it’s bothered me ever since.
We told both our parents later on. We’ve done nothing. All of us just hoped that he’d stop one day and we would just watch our back. I don’t even want anything to happen. I don’t want to confront him. I don’t want my parents to be sad. I don’t want the family to be torn apart.
What makes me feel even worse about this whole thing, though, is how I don’t feel as if I deserve to be scared of my brother. He’s never done anything to me physically. Some months ago I thought of this exact thing. I don’t deserve to feel horrible. I still don’t believe that I do. My sisters aren’t even acting scared. It seems like the only person they worry about is me. But I don’t want them to worry about just me. Why don’t they say anything? Why won’t they tell me if they’re scared? Are they not scared at all?? Am I the only one who’s thinking all of this? If that’s so, then I shouldn’t feel like this. If they aren’t scared, then I don’t deserve to be.
I don’t remember the amount of times I’ve talked to myself. I can’t stop. I can’t stop talking myself down. I’m so fucking terrified, but I don’t deserve to feel this way. I’m so lucky I’m not being sexually abused by him, but I’m just so damn paranoid.
I don’t know if I’m depressed. I took 5 tests online—1 says I’m mildly depressed, 3 says I’m moderately depressed and the last days I’m severely depressed. I know I can’t fully trust these test as they can be unreliable, but I’m too scared to get diagnosed. I don’t even show most of the tendencies depressed people do. I haven’t eaten more or less, my interest in my hobbies haven’t dwindled, my sleeping patterns haven’t changed, etc. I’m afraid of telling my dad how I feel. I’m scared to ask him to take me to get diagnosed. In his eyes, I’ve always been strong. He always tells me I’m strong. He believes in me too much I don’t think I can let him down like this. But I’m so tired. 
I’m not suicidal, but right now the lines are so blurry. Like, I don’t mind if I die right now. If I get stabbed, I want to be left alone to bleed to death. In fact, I think I’d like to be stabbed. I feel like a shitty person. I want to feel the pain when I die. I deserve it.
I can’t count the number of times I’ve just stared into nothing, just talking to myself, crying. Because I know so many people in my life who have it worse. Even right now, as I’m writing this, I’m so hesitant to post it, because it feels like I’m looking for attention. I don’t know if people will believe me, but I’m so fucking exhausted. I don’t even know how often cases like mine happen. I don’t know what to do.
I’ve been rambling, I apologise. I just hope someone’s read this far. I feel so alone. I need advice. I need help."
702,Need advice now,"TRIGGER WARNING:SUICIDE

I live with my mom as I am still a minor, it is just us (and our dogs atm). I’ve been depressed for a good amount of time and have also experienced an ED on and off for this past year; today I overate and decided to take a lot Tylenol/Acetaminophen. It wasn’t a whole bottle, but it was over the daily recommendation (6 tablets in 24 hours). I don’t know if I want to die or just purge, but I’m too scared to tell my Mom what I did, as she has no knowledge of my mental health/ideation. I’m not sure what to do right now, over than wait and see if symptoms crop up :/"
703,I think I might be on the autism spectrum (Asperger's syndrome) What now? (18M),"Hi, in the past few years, especially in the past few months I've noticed I'm quite different than everybody else, at first I thought it was everyone else who was different. As time went by I realized maybe it was me who was the different one all along. The only person I've been able to actually relate to and stay good friends with is my only friend who happens to have Asperger's. Years ago I asked him what the symptoms of Asperger's are and noticed it was pretty similar to my personality. Lately it seems that I'm matching up with the symptoms more and more. Now that I'm at a point where I should really start to socialize and I work on myself 

I know that I should talk to my doctor and see about getting a diagnosis but the past few days I've tried calling and the line has been busy everytime and asperger's syndrome is almost rarely diagnosed in adults. I also have a counsellor who I could talk to about it? But he can't give me a diagnosis anyways. Any help is appreciated :)"
704,"Letting out some sadness, anger and hurt","I really am sad and angry all the time. I know it's nobody's fault to why I am struggling and it makes it even harder because I can't really blame anyone. It's just easier to blame someone. I am stuck at home in this quarantine and I don't have anyone to talk to. I know my friends will say that I can talk to them or text them but the moment I start to open up about some deep issues, I feel like they are getting uncomfortable because they don't know how to deal with these issues either. And I get it, it's not their fault. I can't afford therapy and I don't want the people I love deal with my problems. I hate how my body looks right now because I haven't been exercising and eating is the only thing that distracts me from my self loathing. I have tried so many times to do some home exercises because I can't go out, but I can't make a routine out of it. I get sudden burst of anger now and then and immediately feel guilty because it's nobody's fault. I have other health problems and I just feel like its so unfair. Then I feel so selfish because other people have it worse than me, the world is in chaos. I feel like I'm asking for pity and I don't wanna be this attention seeking bitch. I am writing this out to rant, it will probably get lost but I guess I just want to be heard and validated for once and this is my way of letting it out."
705,Pretty sure I'm depressed so here goes,"Not good at wording shit but here goes

So i got out of a toxic relationship a couple weeks ago but like since i don't feel happy. Like yea i got my friends but i just feel like shit, I'm always upset and feeling like a chicken in a slaughterhouse. Idk whats wrong with me i just wanna be a happy fella again. Idk where im going with this but i guess any tips for dealing with depression would be appreciated and thank you for reading"
706,27m and way too hyper almost all of the time,"tl;dr way too fucking hyper and have been since I was a child, will adhd meds clam me down or make it worse? 

My whole life, I’m so hyper. Like to the point where I can’t sit still and be comfortable and relax because this anxious energy in my body just wants to go go go go. On a scale of 1-10 it can usually be a pretty high 8. 

Also, focus. It seems my awareness of my outside world is literally everywhere. It can shift from me noticing my fan on my body, to me getting severely lost in a day dream or a thought in a matter of milliseconds. 

Will ADHD meds calm me down or make this even worse? Have an appointment with my psychiatrist on the 16th and am going to talk to him about it. 

I want to be able to just relax if I want to, especially during this whole covid nonsense. Sit and watch tv and not fidget my legs or lose interest and move on to something else because I get bored even tho what I’m watching really interests me. 

Sigh. I just want to chill and not be so overstimulated ALL THE TIME lol 
I feel like I drink 5 energy drinks a day but all I do is smoke cigarettes. I don’t even drink caffeine or have a lot of sugar intake. 

Thoughts?"
707,Are there any video games that address mental health that have worked for you?,"I've heard a lot about video games that help with mindfulness, meditation, etc, and I'm curious if there are any that have helped you in particular? I wrote about a few that I found on my blog, but I'll bet there are tons more out there, and I want to try them out. Games about meditation, affirmations, etc.. any recommendations?

[Here](https://millennialmoderator.com/stay-mentally-healthy-at-home-with-these-mindfulness-games) is the article incase anyone is interested. I don't think this is promotion because neither the article or the games cost any money.."
708,Experiences with EMDR?,My therapist and psychiatrist think it would be a good fit for me. And I want to deal with my trauma but I'm also kinda nervous. I just wanna know how it went for other people. So if any of you are comfortable with sharing I'd appreciate it.
709,As a doctor should i feel anything if a patient dies while i'm treating them ?,"Okay so i just graduated medical school 3 months ago and i'm now in my mandatory training year before i can get my full medical license . In addition to the whole stress of dealing with corona and the fear that i may end up hurting my family if i get infected and unknowingly infect them , sth happened last week that i feel weird about . So i was attending a baby delivery and long story short the baby didn't make it and there was severe trauma to the baby which necessitated that it's head be severed and removed operatively , obviously everyone in the delivery room was distraught but they kept their composure . However i did not feel anything . Like i know i should feel sad if not for the baby like for the family but i don't feel anything . I'm just thinking about it a lot and trying to think what happened to lead to this and i can't get it out of my mind no matter how hard i try .

Is this normal ?"
710,Should I tell my parents or not?,"I've been having lots of ups and downs lately. Every time I experience a rough patch I just tell myself it'll get better soon but after about two good days I always come crashing down again and it's really preventing me from advancing at anything I want to accomplish. I'm starting to feel like I have no other option than seeking therapy.


The only problem is that I should decide whether to tell my parents or to go to therapy ""secretly"". My parents care for me a lot so telling them that I'm struggling would definitely hurt them and make them worry. I'm an adult so I don't need my parents to take me anywhere or book me a therapist's appointment, but it still would feel kind of bad to lie to them (due to lockdown I should tell them what I'm doing every time I go out). 


The only other option would be waiting to seek help until around September when I move out. I'm not sure what to do."
711,Why do I do this?,"I keep finding myself paused. Doing nothing for mintues, occasionally hours. Just sitting. Staring. Not even looking at my phone. 

I have a lot of things to do, and that is what I'm thinking about. But also, almost not thinking about, at the same time. Have you ever had a track of something suddenly jam and all you can hear is a single, unmelodious sound. It's the content of the track, but something has gone wrong, it's had a dysfunction and it has ground to a stop at a particular point and it just can't get onto the next bit. Not skipping, but a second of sound, drawn out for much longer than it was meant to be. And cos it was just a second, it stops being what it was, a voice or a beat or anything that made sense, but something loud and neverending. 

I don't know why this happens. I eventually pull myself out of it. But why do I do this?"
712,I want to stop hurting...,"So many things are going through my mind right now. Like a huge mess of tangled cords, I want to straighten and fix it, but why is it so hard?

Constantly feeling empty and lost. I can’t concentrate at all. Sudden attacks of sadness throughout the day. My heart feels heavy. I feel stuck in one place. Why can’t I move forward? I want to move forward!!! It’s so hard to tell my friends about how I feel. It’s so hard to find someone who will be able to fully understand how I really feel. I do want someone to comfort me, but if it’s just gonna be the same “everything will be okay” respond then I’d rather not share it with them. 

I know I may be doing self pity which is not good. I know others have their own problems too. But how? How is it that they have someone for them? Can someone save me too? I really want to stop hurting now."
713,What is this?,"So I should preface with the fact I have both bipolar disorder and currently unmedicated ADHD.

This has been a problem for as long as I can remember and im curious...

I struggle with this a lot. I will become friends with someone, itll go steady, and suddenly I have this incredible love and passion for them. All I want is to be with them, spend time with them, talk to them, and just everything with them. I get attached and spoil them with love and gifts and attention and I feel like if i lost them it would be awful... and then one day out of the blue I feel so indifferent to them. I suddenly dont care as much, I feel apathetic, and sometimes they even bother me or get on my nerves when they're doing literally nothing? Sometimes even I hate them? This has happened with people I dont get close with either and I know spending a lot of time with someone can make you hate them but this happens with people who I DONT spend a lot of time with. What is this sudden feeling? What do these feelings mean?"
714,I like being angry. Help,"So i have come to the conclusion, that I, for some weird reason, like being angry, but only when i am alone. It makes me feel confident, and it boosts my thought process and makes me feel patriotic for some reason. and idk its pretty weird. So my weird ass question is; What are some good ways to stay angry?

Edit: I realise this is probably terrible for my mental health. But like, it has its benefits..."

716,I'm tired of being invisible and lonely,"20 M

I'm experiencing one of the most devastating depressive episodes that I've ever had and i can't reach out , i feel so lonely and i totally deserve this , i have no life so why would i expect anyone to be interested , 

nothing is happening in my life literally nothing , and please don't suggest some stereotypical things to fill up my life cause i can't do anything , I'm too stupid , weak , mentally unstable , and i can't see myself anywhere close to the normal people.

That might sound like my normal life cycle , but the thing is i met a girl on Twitter almost a week ago ,back in the days we went to the same school and knew each other very well , that was totally a coincidence but we had a nice conversation and followed each other.

I found that she has so much going on in her life ,very popular and charismatic , and almost all her friends are , I mean they definitely have problems also cause life is a tragedy at the end , but at least they are not lonely freaks who either banging their heads against the wall or laying in bed wishing to die like me 

I'm not even looking for a relationship , i just wanna make friends but this makes me so inferior , i rather want to cope with being lonely , i want to know how to be enough for myself"
717,I am so unenthused with my life. I feel dead inside.,"TLDR: I’m 23, I have no meaning in life, I’m pretty terrified I’ll never meet someone and I’m losing the will to keep plugging away. Considering packing my things and moving abroad, just so I can feel something other than monotonous boredom.

It all just feels so pointless. I joined the military when I was 18, hated it and ended up leaving at the end of my 4 year contract. I’m now 23, currently in training to join the police (UK not US thankfully) and I know it’s not what I want to do, I never wanted to, it’s just the best option available to me right now. I feel like I’d like to do something working in mental health as I do find fulfilment in personally helping people, but pretty much all routes into that field require university education, which isn’t an option for me. I have no idea what my purpose in life is, and I’ve never been good at anything. The only thing in my life that I’ve stuck to is my physical fitness because I love it, but I’m athletically extremely average, and that’s only because I work hard at it.

I feel like I’ll probably be alone too. I’ve only ever had an intense but brief relationship with one woman, and casual flings with a few others. In all honestly I fell in love with her, but it didn’t work out and despite my heart not wanting to, I understand we’re incompatible and she wasn’t the person I thought she was. She treated me pretty badly. Everything else has been casual and lacking of true emotional connection. My hopes of finding a life partner are so low, I can barely relate to anyone I meet. Modern relationships just feel callous and opportunistic. It feels like people look at potential partners as commodities rather than human beings, being judged on their “sexual market value” rather than the content of their character, with the option of a “higher value” partner only a swipe away. 

I think most people, and my generation in particular, are vapid, vain, narcissistic and void of substance. Dating apps have only reaffirmed this to me. I feel so disassociated with this selfie society, everyone is so obsessed with their meaningless fabricated image on social media. There’s not a single “friend” that I’ve made that I’ve ever forged a real bond with and I feel like I’m going through life with no meaningful connections outside of my parents. We live in a time where people will ask “how are you?” and aren’t interested in the answer. At times I just feel so lonely. What’s the point of life when you’re spending it entirely alone?

I think my lack of faith in finding a woman who I truly connect with affects my overall motivation in achieving what I thought I wanted. I’ve always wanted to create a financially comfortable life so that I could provide my future family with anything they want and need, but when I realise that I’m working for something that may never exist I just seem to lose all motivation. I saved up for a deposit for my first apartment, but the property prices where I live are so extortionate that the mortgage needed would basically make me a slave to the bank. Working to pay off the mortgage for a tiny apartment for the foreseeable future with no financial room to enjoy life outside of work, go travelling or take any entrepreneurial risks. What’s the point in a life like that? It all just seems so frivolous.

I’ve felt totally bored with my life for years. The only reprieve from boredom I had was when I went travelling with some of the money I saved, going from December to February, I had some amazing experiences, but that isn’t real life. I often think of packing my things and moving far away, somewhere like Australia or Canada. Maybe Spain as my Spanish speaking skills would come in handy. Just so I can get out of the hamster wheel I feel myself trapped in. Just so I can feel something meaningful. I feel awful too because I’m so lucky to be a healthy, able human being but I can’t help how I feel.

If you read all that, thank you so much for your time. I don’t know what I want to come out of this post, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I don’t really have anyone to talk to and I feel like I’m deteriorating every day."
718,"Creative writing describing depression, rough copy.","Posted to r/depression too. Warning- mentions of self harm, depression and suicide.

 \-

You do not know exactly when you fell into the river of glum. Nor do you recall the first time you fully realised what had happened. All you remember is feeling the cold shock and your arms desperately flailing, hoping to any god that you were going to be saved. But your attempt was just that. An attempt. It took months before you completely sank but when you did, the drowsiness and emptiness filled the days while they blended. Your body constantly fought to keep the water out of your lungs but your mind wanted nothing more than to open your mouth and finally, *finally,* feel the sweet cool liquid fill your lungs so your pain could finally end.

You scream for help, in your own way. Air bubbles reach the surface of the water but people who rarely visit assume it's part of the lake, like it's usually like that. People who frequent notice the bubbles but decide not to acknowledge it; it cannot be that bad. They always miss the warning signs.

After months dragging on and hoping for your end, you finally reach the top again and you allow yourself to smile, a real smile. Your head stays above water for a while, you are not exactly sure how long. Maybe weeks? Days? The time is unimportant to you, you are just simply happy to be above water. You are so happy that you do not notice the pull of the current. When you do notice, it is too late. You have travelled to far to go back so you ride out the journey, terrified of whats to come.

When the journey is completed, you are no longer in the river. You've officially reached the ocean of depression.

Your head aches and you eyes sting. The salty water makes its way up your nose but you cannot do anything to pacify this feeling. Slowly, you begin to sink again. You are no longer free to scream, forced to suffer in incessant silence. Your air bubbles are now ripples but, once again, nobody notices. Your body aches so you stop moving so the pain dulls.

The ripples that used to be slight are now crashing waves which cause you discomfort, but you hope maybe they carry you to shore, so maybe, just maybe, you can escape.

You would do anything to feel fresh water again; anything was better than this. The stinging and aching ganged up on you, making you feel worthless. You think of all the people who face the same and you think of how weak you are. But truthfully? You're not weak. **You're not weak.**

After so very long in the ocean, you notice a bright light down deep into the ocean and you use all of your strength to swim down, hoping to find something to help. You swim forever eventually making your way to the light that you had seen. You are way deeper than you've ever been. You're now in the Abyssopelagic Zone - the official abyss.

But it's clear now that the brightness that had appealed to you was not a clear way to escape. It would bring you out of pain for mere seconds before it hit you again. Drugs, alcohol and self harm was a temporary fix. It didn't help you escape the ocean and eventually, you sunk deeper. The deepest layer. Hadalpelagic Zone.

Many people have visited and many didn't make a return. Most had ended it themselves. Most just sat there for very long.

When you reached there, you decided to stay for a while before doing anything rash. But the constant thought in you head had been 'how long will this last?'

720,Thoughts,"Ive started getting these thoughts of killing myself. Ive struggled with mental health for a year now and im currently seeing a counselor.

the thoughts sprung up about three weeks ago and they have gottwn really bad. I tried to strangle myself with a cord but backed out before it went wrong.
i suffer from panic attacks and i get periods where im just cripplingly sad. Those contribute to the thoughts but also so does feeling worthless and parents that wont supoort me for who i am.

One of the worst bits is i dont know why im sturggling with these thoughts or anything in general ive never had an official disgnosis of anything and i want to know what the hell is wrong with me i feel so lost and empty and i feel like im drowning i want to whatever this is to be over so badly. 

Ive self harmed before and i just i dont want that to go further and im worried it will.

does anyone have any advice how to deal with these thoughts?"

722,What to replace exercise with,"When lockdown began I took to doing daily online Zumba classes in an attempt to keep my mental health in check.

I'm amazed at the results! I've never been one to exercise and always give it up after a week or so when doing it for weight loss, but now I'm doing it for my mental health I absolutely love it and look forward to it most days.

I've found that I can skip a day no bother, but if I skip 2 I feel a dip in my mood/mental capacity on day 3. Which is what leads me to my new problem... I have a muscle injury (I think from a looooong day of walking having forgotten to stretch before or after, oopsie!) And everywhere I've read about it recommends simply resting it for a few weeks till it gets better on its own.

For the first time in my life I'm dreading NOT exercising... I can just see my mood plummeting and all the overwhelming dark thoughts and brain fog flooding back... Anyone got any suggestions for what I can replace exercising with for the time being to keep my mind healthy? 

TLDR: I have to temporarily give up exercising because of an injury, what can I do instead to keep my mental health in check?"
723,To anyone who's ever been admitted to a mental hospital:,"Does every hospital suck? Are there any good mental hospitals out there? Every hospital seems to have underpaid staff and too many patients to treat at once. Nearby facilities that either I or a person I know have been to seem to have the same issues. They're dirty, the staff doesn't care about their patients, and they are not getting treated properly. I've talked to a few people who were previously in hospitals and they all said they lied to get out. They said that they were happy so they could get out of the hell they were in whilst staying there. And every treatment group is the same. They all seem to be set up as addiction treatment groups. But not everyone has an addiction problem. These state hospitals are failing to help us. So many patients get readmitted after getting discharged. And some patients even end up in prison. The treatment for young adults and children should be prioritized because they are our future, but all treatment should change. After leaving the hospital I was still depressed, I just faked being better because I couldn't stand the screaming and the violence that I saw. There wasn't enough staff to supervise two groups. I made friends who ended up taking their lives because they couldn't be helped. These hospitals need better funding, but even with that funding, what can they do? Is it worth funding? At least they could make a few groups for people with different problems. In a large group, we feel even more unheard than we were before we got admitted. Let me know what your take is, please"
724,Help me help my parents,"Hey all, I’m a 30 year old guy with PTSD with an 18 year old sister suffering from depression. Our parents were the source of distress, but they are trying to learn and correct their behavior. 

Unfortunately, they have almost no understanding of mental illness, what it means, or how it effects people. I’m trying to help educate them, but I am realizing I don’t really know much either...

If you have resources or book suggestions that are specifically targeted at parents starting from 0?"
725,When do I give up?,"Over the past several years I've seen 8 therapists, taken about 6 different medications, been to numerous support groups, treatment clinics, everything. I've gotten nowhere.

I am completely disabled by obsessive thoughts and compulsions and constant doubt and obsessive categorization regarding every single thing I do. I haven't left the house in a year. I can't engage in any hobby, every single hobby needs to be a specific way. My creativity is stifled so badly. I can't eat most days. I'm just so miserable.

I've been battling this for about 2 years, it wasn't as bad before High school ended. I can't function anymore. I just need help. I haven't seen or heard of anyone with my severity of OCD so I feel extremely isolated. Only Howard Hughes and a lady I saw on Dr Phil a long time ago, and at the time of seeing that I wasn't as bad as this. If I fight the compulsions too much the stress brings on psychosis and I begin to hear the obsessions as whispers and see people standing over me at night, so even though I've put up a fight, I can't put up too much.

I am being supported by family. I could just give up. I've been working so hard for years, fighting compulsions, breaking obsessions by forcing new thoughts into my head. I don't enjoy doing anything because everything has obsessions but I force myself to do things in the hopes that eventually something will just ""break"" and I can do things again. I'm really trapped."
726,Help before this turns into a bigger problem? ;3,"Hello, I’m back :3 Today I want to talk about health anxiety. I haven’t been diagnosed with any mental illness like try that, OCD or whatever so feel free to consider my thoughts invalid uwu 

Last year, I sort of had some health anxiety?? I had random head and chest pain which made me panic but it was nothing to worry about (duh lol). Then with the coronavirus situation going on, it came back but exclusively related to that and nothing else. This was mainly in March, I can’t remember if I made a post about what went on on Thursday, 12th of March 2020 but let’s just say... it doesn’t matter lol. So anyway, now that time has passed since then and I’ve not left my house in nearly three months, my “anxiety” related to the coronavirus pandemic has largely subsided (God is good :))

So uh now, I’m going to talk about eating disorders. I by no means am starting that I have an eating disorder. So yeah, I joke about when chatting with my mum and I tell her I’m fat, just a joke obvs and I don’t think it really. Like, I’m not the skinniest of people but I’m not TERRIBLY overweight. But I’ve definitely lost a lot of weight recently, methinks.

Recently, I’ve been worrying a bit about what I eat. There’s this supermarket chain where I live, and their tuna sandwiches are very good BUT they use white bread for it and if any YouTuber has taught me anything, specifically about white bread, it’s TheOdd1sOut (if you’ve seen his video about junk food, you’ll know what I’m talking about :P ). I’ve really always been taught that white bread is Not Particularly Good but in moderation, apparently, it’s fine in moderation. However, a few weeks ago, I was planning to have one of these sandwiches when I felt like I shouldn’t bc white bread... and I frantically started googling if it’s really bad and everything and eventually, my mum suggested that I simply remove the bread, take the filling stuff with tuna and everything and stick it in between some brown bread. So I did do that but I just thought I was so so stupid that I punched myself in the stomach right in front of her lol. I don’t really self-harm that much, tho I stabbed myself with a pen the other day.

But what am I getting at here? Well, I’ve started to have this bad feeling at the back of my head when I’m eating, even when I haven’t eaten THAT much (idrk, I’ll have to pay attention as to when I start feeling bad tomorrow at breakfast). Not just because I don’t want to become some sick glutton but also because I worry about if what I’m eating is doing me harm or not. I haven’t been eating chocolate much lately; on Mother’s Day (15th), Dad got a LOT of chocolate and shortbread biscuits and stuff and I ate more than I should have probably, I didn’t feel absolutely awful but decided to tone down the chocolate consumption. Since then I’ve had one straciatella yoghurt and two Kinder Schoko-Bons, all on separate days and that’s it in terms of chocolate. I don’t recall anything apart from that. I was going to have  an After-Eight the other day (they are very, very flat if you didn’t know) because my parents were having one each and they didn’t want to have one if I wasn’t going to and just as I was getting one out for myself, I had a random intrusive thought saying, ‘Giving in to temptation haha,’ literally just in a humorous tone and so my parents had theirs but I didn’t. So that’s that, thank you for reading, I will make another post on a different topic now :3

Tl;dr A mixture of not wanting to be greedy and possible health anxiety is starting to give me small (at the moment...) thoughts of guilt or concern about what I’m eating."
727,It keeps haunting me and ruining my mood,"  

guys I have done something that I sincerely regret about a month ago  I told somebody in an online first person shooter  to  hang himself many times .If you dont play online first person shooters  then your not gonna fully understand this but the guy was rage hacking and was on the other team .rage hacking is a form of cheating in which your opponents automatically dies as soon as you press the fire button  if they can be shot in the first place of course when you are facing a rage hacker The 30-50 minutes of potential enjoyment is completely ruined by another person so I got frustrated and said something I shouldnt have said(hang yourself) and the dude typed ok thats fucked up I know he didnt mean it but thats fucked up

Sometimes this utterly irrational and ludicrous fear of him doing it suddenly comes to my mind ,since he is banned he is ignoring his account completely and thats not helping it either. these laughable thoughts keep haunting me and making me anxious and  they'v had a negative effect on my mental state .   for anybody reading this : it might seem obvious that when people say hang yourself they dont mean it and thats the case for all the other nasty shit people say on the internet when people are behind a monitor they say stuff that they would never say irl and maybe we should think about the receiving end of  the stuff we post on the internet I for one will never say hang yourself or anything like it  again"
728,Help. I need to know what’s wrong with me,"Yesterday I was upset with my boyfriend and went onto Instagram to post something on my story about him. Of course I could never tarnish his name so I didn’t go through with it. I specifically remember hitting the delete button and clicked the are you sure button too. The next morning I woke up and felt out of place. I didn’t really feel like anything was real and I just felt really lost for some reason and everything was a little blurry. I told my boyfriend about it when he went to work because I was worried. Then he sent me a screen shot of the post that I remember deleting. I know I deleted it, it takes 3 steps to post something and id remember if I did. Immediately after I felt like I was going out of my mind and started having a full blown panic attack. I’ve been researching but I can’t put it in the right words because I can’t explain the feeling. Can someone tell me what’s going on 😣"
729,Should I be at least a bit concerned?,"I won’t put a trigger warning because you’ll consider me absolutely pathetic if I do :)


So, like I’ve said before on this subreddit, I’m not doing the best at maths right now. So, my dad contacted the coordinator person at my school and she in turn was able to contact the daughter of a teacher whom I don’t know at my school, and long story short, she is now giving me multiple 1-1.5-hour lessons a week via WhatsApp video call to prepare for my final exam next week. I’ve now known her for almost two weeks, my most recent lesson was today and my next is on Friday (I’m nearly 16 and male btw)

She was giving me time to practise an exercise in the textbook today when I heard the standard sound of a screenshot being made. Yes, it’s pathetic that I’m even the least bit preoccupied about this, I know :P but still. It seemed kind of weird. But it’s also weird because I don’t know if you’re even supposed to hear that when it’s on the phone of the person you’re in a call with? Or maybe it was just that loud that her microphone picked it up. I was certainly not taking a screenshot. When I heard the sound effect, I looked up at my phone screen and I was barely in the shot anyway... I feel like if she wanted to creepily take pictures of she had many much better opportunities. She was alone as well, in her parents’ house (is it weird she just so happened to tell me that just bc earlier?). 

I know this is super super dumb but I wanted to share this, I haven’t told my parents because I know I shouldn’t lol

Tl;dr I heard my maths tutor taking a screenshot during a call, seemed kind of weird. Pls don’t call me stoopid"

736,Feeling nothing but Sadness,For a long time now I’m feeling nothing really. But somehow I laugh and feel sad while feeling nothing inside. Its like i build a Version of myself in my head that i think is supposed to be me and acts like the me from the past but over the years of not feeling anything this copy of me starts to crumble and I start to act less and less human. I started to loose friends and now I’m nearly alone . I question myself if there is any way of getting my emotions back I tried so many things that just didn’t work at all. I’m at a point at which I question myself if there is really any point in continuing this farce of life. This thought gets louder and louder everyday and this emotion consuming void inside me robs me of my sanity everyday. I try to live my life to the fullest somehow everyday for my mum because I just could never leave her alone in this world because she goes trough much more shit then I do.

737,Sleeping 14+ hours a day?,"I’ve never gotten professional help, but I do think I’ve been struggling with depressive thoughts. 

Over the last decade I had been getting little to no sleep, but in the last few years I’ve slept an excessive amount. 

I keep sleeping around 12-14 hours every night, sometimes even more than that. Two days ago, I slept for 16 hours throughout the day. 

I managed to only sleep for 10 hours last night, but I’m still very drowsy and want to go back to sleep. I can’t seem to think straight or function at all unless I get at least 14 hours. 

I’ve tried exercising, but it hasn’t had much of an effect on my sleeping habits. If anything, I sleep even more when the workout is intense.

I don't understand what's going on in the world today, I don't even know how to articulate what's going on inside my own head. All I can try to do is live each day by day, in some fashion... Right now, it's the bare minimum I can do to get out of bed.

Is that normal for someone like me to experience this or is it a mental health issue? It doesn’t feel like depression, because I’m not particularly worried or anything, it’s just strange."

I’m too nice and girls think of me as their Gay best friend. I know 😂. Also as I’ve been told I’m too much of a Mommy’s boy and never rebellious, like going out with friends and doing something bad.

I care about him and love him so so so much and I just don’t know what to do to help, I’ve tried looking up what to do but I just don’t know. I’m afraid of telling anyone about it because he opened up to me about it and I don’t want to break his trust, but it just hurts to much to see him like this. I really want to help and I feel like I should be doing more but I can’t see him because of his parents and everything going on with corona. He means everything to me and seeing him like this is so difficult. I try to just be there for him and give him support but i don’t know what to do or how to help."

744,I’m too old,"This will be long, but tldr down there.

I am a 22 year old girl. I am in a relationship for almost 2 years now. I had very strict parents (my mom is probably a narcissist). Here’s my issue.

I was never allowed to experience my teenager years just like everyone else appears to have experienced. I know that there were parties going on, but I was never allowed to go. Due to this, I was rather an outcast and thanks to constant undermining from my mother, I was scared of the other kids as well. 

When I was 19, I got into college and was allowed to go occasionally go out. The problem was, that my friends (that I made) wanted to party a lot. I was allowed to be outside only until 10pm or midnight max, so I have always missed the parts where the memories were made.

When I got into relationship, I was essentially just looking for a way out from my mother. We moved in together very quickly, which meant no curfew for me (my mother got bored of me soon  too, so she stopped caring). 

However, now I had a boyfriend. I couldnt just mindlessly enjoy myself and then wonder what happened. I had always to make sure that nobody got “too friendly” with me, because I would hate to cheat on my bf. Also my bf absolutely despises smoking, which is something I like to do when I drink.

I know my problem is very stupid. And I know that it’s so dumb that I’m literally bawling my eyes out over this for a week now. But now I see that I’m getting my first wrinkles. Graduation is coming (in here we have to take a big test, so lots of studying) and I’m starting to plan my future as working in my field, having a nice house and a kids. 

But I don’t see the part where I get to be me. I can’t see where I can enjoy myself. Where’s my period of going out, having random hook ups, regretting everything and whoring for likes on Instagram? I know it’s idiotic, but this problem seems to be bugging me more than I’d like to admit and I don’t know what to do.

Tldr - always had a curfew, now I have a bf. I feel like I’ve missed out a lot on life when I was a teen and now I’ve got past the point where I can still catch up"
745,Differentiating anxiety filled fears with real issues,Hello I’m 17m I’ve been contemplating going to therapy because I believe I have social anxiety among other things. I often disassociate myself from my family feeling embarrassed of them or just uninterested in talking with them. I have friends and often get afraid of losing them but I think I’m more scared of being alone and without any friends then loosing them individually. I’m also not sure how sad I would be if my family died. I believe I would feel sorrow but I’m not sure to what extent. I use to wish for some of there deaths which sounds horrible because I believed it would make my life easier. I can’t tell what is  wrong with me and often over analyze myself and others. I was a fat and and very introverted teen till a few years ago with no friends so that probably had an affect on me. At night especial when under the influence of weed I overthink every interaction I have with people and often think something is wrong with me I just can’t ever tell what is just anxiety driven fears or actually issues I have. I think I’ve gotten a lot better because I go to parties and have friends instead of being always alone consumed by depression and anxiety but I think I still have other issues
746,I get extremely triggered by shooting episodes not because I was in one but because I basically almost was one (without gun) ... Please read to understand,"In high school I was getting bullied constantly I had no friends I was pushed down a set of stairs and the girl was getting away with it because she was mildly autistic (which was just an excuse) and more stuff I’m not comfortable sharing.

I was getting beat by my dad at home and really wanted to die but I was so angry I wanted them to pay for what they did and wanted the teachers to know how they failed me.

So one day I took my dads Stanley knife ( I didn’t get a gun for two reasons, 1) I didn’t want to accidentally hurt anyone who didn’t deserve it and guns are unpredictable 2) where I lived getting a gun is really difficult ) 

I made my peace I knew I wasn’t going to get out alive and that I was going to hell for it but I just didn’t care.

I planned to just wait outside the first girls class ( I got to leave classes early so they wouldn’t see me in the hall) then when she inevitably started something I’d stab her in the stomach and move on then go to the next girls and do the same.


Obviously it wasn’t planned out that well and I broke down in the bathrooms before the class started and cried I googled school annihilators and realised all the kids killed were hero’s nobody knew what they did to me.

Every time I watch a school shooting episode on stuff like greys or one tree hill, criminal minds or one of the many shows that cover this subject I cry and cry because while I never planned on hurting anyone who didn’t deserve it I see the effect it has on those experiencing them 

So I decided to wait till I was 18 and sue them because some of the stuff was definitely illegal I’m 19 now and sorting the plans to take them down legally 


I’m so sorry this is one of my biggest shames in life and I really hate myself everyday for feeling this way 

So this is my story... I don’t know why I’m sharing it I just want to tell someone because I’ve kept this in so long 

I’m so sorry"

The title says it all really. I've had one relationship which ended badly, then a few less serious things (which I'm not into).

And because of lock down, it's making it much harder to even attempt to meet someone. 

One big issue that I have is a very small social circle, and some of my friends not willing to go to clubs etc. 

Tinder doesn't work. Other apps are shit. And lack of intimacy with someone is really just making me so depressed. Has anyone got any suggestions?"

I don't want to be the guy who lashes out and accuses people of ignoring me if they really aren't. But at the same time I just can't help but feel like people don't care about me if they routinely take like 20+ minutes to respond to a message. It almost feels like they're nonverbally saying ""don't speak to me"". It's just a vibe that I pick up from people who don't show any form of eagerness to get back to me. Is this normal? Is there anything I can do to lessen these feelings?"

755,Growing up with a single mentally ill parent,"Growing up my mom had always been someone I was afraid of as a child, I would not feel comfortable at home and would want to spend time with my neighbours kids who my mom knew or my dad - as my parents were separated. 

As I aged my moms paranoia became more prevalent. I would not be allowed to stay over at my friends unless she knew the parents very well. I wasn’t allowed to walk to the bus stop around the corner. These behaviours all continued up until I was 18 years of age. When I started high school my moms paranoia turned into delusions that people were breaking into the house, following her at work. She had video cameras set up in the house at all times. She ended all of her relationships with her friends. She began to accuse her children, myself included of being part of “gang stalking” and being paid off by bikers to hide things in the house or raise her electricity bill so she would be forced out of her home. She accused her friends of doing this too. I was afraid of my mom. Sometimes I would come home from school and she would lash out at me for really small problems. accuse me of being lazy and disrespecting her by not cleaning even though she was organizationally a disaster and a hoarder. I never knew what I was coming home to. School became my only safe space as things progressed. I was lucky enough to be able to go away for university. 

While I was in school my dad ended up getting a form for my mom and she was sent to the hospital for psych assessment and passed all the questions and was returned home. I was told to not speak to my father anymore. And I never did again as I was afraid of her reaction. My brother left home at 20 and stopped talking to my mom since then because he was tired of feeling like a monster and unsafe in his home. 

This whole mess ended this year when unfortunately my mom passed away from cancer. The sad part is she admits to living with symptoms of colon cancer I.e weight loss, liquid bowel movements, having accidents and in the later part fevers and immobilizing pain for about 5 years. She never told anyone. She would drop hints that she thinks that she’s being poisoned because the dog would also have the runs. And she did not trust doctors. When they diagnosed her she was rushed to the ER as she was in so much pain she could not move, she had no choice but to go.  The doctors could SEE the tumour just by looking at her abdomen. It was way too late. She was given 6 months to live w/out 1-2 years with treatment.  She chose no treatment. Through the course of her cancer she kept saying she would get treatment then have me drive out to her and take her to the cancer centre and then have her say actually I don’t want it and then reschedule until next week. She did this for about 4 months until she was admitted into the hospital indefinitely. 

She would play me and my siblings against each other over the course of her illness. All while I felt sorry for her despite having such resentment towards her for such a confusing and scary upbringing. I am not left with myself trying to figure out the damage this has caused me now that I am alone. 

I just wanted to share my story of what I went through. 

If anyone else has a similar story I would love to hear it. If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do for my mental health I would also love to hear that. 

Mental health was a very taboo thing in my household, I just took the first step to see a doctor and now I am waiting for an appointment to receive psychiatric evaluation."

As I'll only be taking select quotes from the interview it's left anonymous, so elect anyone you want for it. Just shoot me a message/DM if you're interested! Topics available for interview are here (Recently updated with bonus/optional topics ): [https://pastebin.com/hc3UsS6y](https://pastebin.com/hc3UsS6y)  
Depression, PTSD and DID interviews are not available, I've gotten multiple for each already. Anything else is on the table!

I hope to hear from you! Stay strong and remember to take care of yourself. You're not alone and deserve to have people around you who care. 🖤"
757,quit my job today 🤘😛,"which is a good thing!!!

won't explain the whole thing but I felt very unsafe and unrespected. my anxiety and depression had never been worse and after months of trying to put up with it I quit today.

I feel so free and relieved now. woot! &lt;3"
758,racist intrusive thoughts,"bad title, i know.

the gist is: sometimes my brain is horrible. i'll look at a picture of a black couple for instance, and i'll think ""aw what a nice couple"" but a little voice in the back of my brain will say ""f-ing [n-word]"" and i dont want to think that i KNOW its bad and theyre not my thoughts and i want them to SHUT UP

is there something seriously wrong with me? can i make them stop?"
759,I'm deeply ashamed for having a couple of nice things,"tl;dr: I feel deeply ashamed for having a couple of nice things.

I've dealt with this issue since after college, where I was able to obtain a pretty nice job after graduating when most of my peers graduated jobless into the great recession, and I'm not sure why.

For some background, I'm a first generation minority immigrant and my family and I crawled out from receiving food stamps to being pretty well off at the moment.  I'm now a lawyer, I make a good living, and I saved aggressively to pay off my student debt.  Even though my parents and mentors tell me that I ""deserve"" it - I feel incredibly guilty when I spend more than a little bit of money on myself.  By contrast, I feel fine spending money and splurging on my family and friends.  

For example, I can fit all the clothes I own in a single duffle bag, and when my parents gave me a nice watch (a Longines) for my birthday, I am constantly afraid that people are judging me.  I need to emphasize that **I don't fear being mugged, rather, I'm constantly plagued by the idea that the watch is ""too good"" for me** or ""above my station,""  even though it wasn't a particularly expensive watch. 

By comparison, I can't fathom how some people walk around with Chanel bags or wear Rolexes... I feel like I would die of shame.  The constant thought that keeps repeating in my head is: ""wow did your dad/parents buy you that?""  No one has ever actually said that to me, even though that is true for my watch.  It's gotten to the point that I just can't wear it anymore.

Is this just me?  Do I need help, or am I just making a big deal out of nothing?"
760,I have imaginary friends at the age of 18+,"Hey! call me Pillow.

(TLDR: I had them since I was small, I have real friends today, but I still have them with me, you can ask me anything about it, how did it commence and much more detail)

I won't be telling my exact age since it's personal information, but I will tell something that all of you can be open about in your opinions on the comment section.

like the title says, I still have imaginary friends, I have friends on my imagination that I interact with often, almost everyday.

since I was a child I had imaginary friends because typically I had no friends.

has I grew up my imagination started to become much more immense and creative to even complex than when i was a child.
these friends started to cheer me up, make me laugh and make me be more open to different interests, traits of myself and such.
they had helped me throughout all my problems and troubles with my life!

yes there was an immense problem of sadness through and probably loneliness but my same imaginary friends also helped me get into relationships and be more open to have more friends!

I'm not a social butterfly and I don't want to be one either, I'm fine with picking and choosing my friends, if I want to talk to someone I am up to talking and if I don't I'm not going to talk to them.

I already have friends and all to this day both real life and Internet, well more Internet than real life.
but I still have my imaginary friends with me, despite how sometimes my imagination also hurts me sometimes, you see sometimes I can see these red colored monsters with eyes on them looking at me intensely ,

because of this I'm afraid of the dark and although I love scary videos and stories, I rather hear them at day than at night.

I also bring you all up to tell that it's fine to have your own imaginary friends sometimes, again they have helped me through my life and I don't really know what could've been of myself if they where never there."

762,Someday we'll learn to talk about men's mental health,"It won't be soon. I'm sure the title is enough to make a lot of people angry as fuck (""Men do not suffer. I'm still stuck in the 30's where we thought wars were mentally healthy for men""). Many of us will be sacrificed along the way. They'll us how we're actually really horrible beings and it's all our fault.

763,Online therapy?,"So, does anyone here have positive or negative experiences with online therapy? Even with the lockdown lifting here in my state it's hard to find an in-person service at the moment, and I'm considering an online option. But after the big controversy over Better Help, I'm a little wary of the idea. In your experiences, does it work? Not work? Any general advice? I appreciate whatever feedback, thank you."
764,I Just Want Everyone to be Okay,"Feeling white anxious right now. Just got off a call from my Mum who called me because shes lonely and worried about her mums health. I did what I can to help and will go see her for a social distance chat tomorrow to help chear her up. Maybe take the dog for a walk with her. It just really bummed me out. 

With everything that's going in the world and with the people close to me I find myself worried all the time. How do you ease your mind when worried about others?"
765,what's the chance of cancer from tanning beds?,"i know that we still have a headie amount of summer left , but i left in the Midwest so when winter hits... it hits hard.. and long.. and grey..

i used tanning beds for a bit when i was younger to help with depression and it noticably helped. i stopped because i am fair skinned and the risk of cancer freaked me out.

i have a sun light and idk if it does anything but the tanning bed def boosted my brain chems during winter days.

whats worse depression or possible skin cancer ? lol"
766,Questions and rants,"So, I’m an early teenager, and I can’t ever tell if what I’m feeling is just puberty talking or there’s something up with me. Most of what I’m talking about was going on before COVID. 

A lot of the times, I’ll feel really tired and exhausted for no reason other than the fact that I’m just sick of everything: school, my parents, my siblings, my friends (who I dearly love), the carpet, the morning sun, etc. I’ve been kinda just feeling like shit for most of the past six months. With quarantine going on, I feel like I’ve been locked into a hell hole of everything that makes me sad. A lot of tiny things make me ugly cry in my room. Sometimes, I’ll wake up, see an announcement from my teacher on my phone, curl up into a ball, and cry for maybe twenty seconds. I don’t usually cry for a long time, but I do it really frequently. 

I’m also a really nervous person. Like, really fucking nervous. Public speaking is a nightmare, speaking in private is a nightmare, people in general are a nightmare. Everything at school tends to scare the shit out of me. Sometimes, I get so nervous that I start tearing up. It happens almost every time a teacher talks to me, which they seem to really like doing. I’m a “model student” or some shit. Sometimes, I’ll get really nervous for no reason and find a little corner for myself to just tremble. I also get really jumpy and scared with hot flashes and an accelerated heart rate, which I’ve been told was a panic attack, but I don’t know. I find myself thinking about how terrible I am and how much I’ve done wrong, too. 

I actually started writing this post because my accidentally slammed the trash can closed because I was angry, and then my mom yelled at me. Just before that, she belittled me for flinching whenever she turns to me or raises her voice. I physically jumped and ran all the way to my room where I had a tiny meltdown. 

It might just be the fact that I’ve been so stressed. I know it’s not very much compared to so many others, but varsity and club swimming, my grades, dumb school drama, my family, and my expectations have really been putting a toll on me. I really wasn’t getting so much sleep because of all my homework I had to do once I get home from swimming. 

I used to be in a program for gifted children (I’ve gotten in touch with them, and it seems that we’re all angry gays), so my parents have the bar set up really fucking high. I used to strive to be absolutely perfect because that’s pretty much how I’ve been, but I can’t find any purpose in doing anything ever. I’m starting to despise school and teachers and my family who all expect so much. When my mom saw that I scored in the top 2% one year on a test after consistently being in the top 1%, she told me that she was disappointed.

 ‘Cause of that, just seeing a grade less than an A- crushes me. I know I sound like a whiny and privileged bitch, but I don’t know how people take it. The entirety of my *school career* or whatever, my grades were super high because I spent so much time working on stuff. So far, I’ve earned two 4.0’s in middle school. That’d feel pretty good if I actually was happy. I’m probably way too dependent on praise, but I just want my parents to sincerely tell me that they’re proud of me and my efforts. 

My parents, especially my mom, expect a lot from me, and they’re old-fashioned and traditional. I don’t really like her much at all whatsoever, but I’d like to think that I still love her. We get into what she calls arguments a lot. She really isn’t the brightest of the bunch, but she acts like she’s omnipotent. She can never be wrong, and I can’t argue at all because that’s absolutely disrespectful. We were in a Chipotle after a swim meet where I did well and my little sister was more sub-par. My mom was berating her and yelling at her because she was too nervous to order. I knew the feeling that my sister had, so I told to my mom to not be so harsh. She asked me if she had ever been wrong before, and I jokingly responded by saying, “Yeah, on last weeks homework.” That was a pretty big mistake. She straight up disowned me for ten minutes in a chipotle. What the fuck, woman?

Okay, back to mental health. I feel shitty about everything, I feel terrified of everything, and I feel angry at everything. I don’t think anything’s really interfered with my life, but it doesn’t feel good. I haven’t ever tried actually hurting myself, but I do scratch at my arms a lot when I’m nervous, and I usually wouldn’t really mind if a car hit me. 

I think this is a pretty okay summary, and thanks for reading it. I know this is a pretty long post, but I’d really appreciate a response or two from anybody. Just writing about this alone has made me feel a little better."
767,Fear of Men,"Without getting into too much detail, I'm afraid of men. I have had some verbally/physically abusive men in my life and now I'm uncomfortable around members of the opposite sex and it's negatively affecting my ability to have a relationship both platonic and romantic, something I've wanted but turned down because how can I be with someone who I'm afraid of? I have maybe one or two not-too-close guy friends but even then I never get too close, I'm always on high alert, and I can't be affectionate (hugging, handshakes, anything like that).

Any advice on how to get over this? I really wish I didn't feel like this."
768,Why does wvery aspect of my life feel like im in the middle of a fever dream?,"For basically as long as I can remember (not very long) my life has felt like a fever dream.

769,Working from home making interactions with colleagues weird,"Alternative title is 'Microsoft Teams can fuck off', but I'm new here and wasn't sure if I could get away with that.

This is just quick rant because I am stressed AF.

In an ordinary working day social interactions is something I conciously have to try my hardest. It doesn't come easy and sometimes it's tiring but its doable. After a breakdown in my teens/20s it's something I had to actively learn how to do.

But everything moving over to virtual environments has got me struggling again. It's so hard to read tone. One previously perfectly nice and reasonable team member has decided that whenever I have an idea and let people know that I'm going to do the work for it that she's going to do it at the same time then she gets uptight that I'm doing the work I said I was going to do. It's not in itself a huge deal but its bizarre enough that and I've no idea how to deal with it. The not being able to figure out how to address things and struggles to communicate is making me feel super powerless and rattling some negative thought processes. Some folk are kicking off to get their contributions picked when theres a few ideas on the table and I'm left not knowing how to even share my work because I'm paranoid about upsetting people.

I'm barely holding it together through the isolation. I know I'll be OK and the anxiety and constant crying will go away once I don't have to sit with my own thoughts all day. But the longer this goes on the more awkward it will be working with some of my colleagues."

772,"I don't want to give up, because my father is trying so hard to make me happy","I have depression, some pretty serious social phobia and sometimes I become suicidal. I've tried to end it all two months ago and since then, my family has been really concerned about me. 

I live with my dad and I love him so much. He buys me materials so I can make drawings, sculptures and he always praises me. He's trying hard to make me the happiest and I can feel happiness most of the time, but sometimes I feel close to losing everything again. I don't want to make him sad or anyone else from my family.

I feel so guilty, ungrateful for everything. I gave up on therapy because my social phobia almost killed me every time I had an appointment. I know I need to keep going, but it's so difficult sometimes. I'm lost."

774,How do I find a therapist? [x-post],
775,Crippling fear of death since age 10. Trapped in my own personal hell. What the fuck do I do?,"Hey all. Ever since I was 10 years old I have been extremely aware of my own mortality. 

At age 10, I had my first panic attack. It always happened during math class for some reason. It was a feeling of dread and inevitable doom so devastating that it made me stand up out of my seat and almost throw up. I backed into things trying to escape my inescapable thoughts while the class stared. Then it ended after many dreadful seconds. After that, I had one almost every single day for a year. 

Back then, I brought upon my own panic attacks. I would get too deep into my thoughts and end up in this zone where I truly comprehend the pointlessness of everything. The mortality of me and the only person I ever loved, my mom. I would fall into a zone where I realize she could die that day, I could die that day, I could burn in hell for all eternity for not believing in God, and the actual infinite size of eternity and more. I would call this zone ""wave of realization"" when trying to explain what I was going through. No one understood. I started having them at home too. Minimum 2 panic attacks a day. 

I remember telling my sister that I wished I could sleep forever to stop this. I didn't realize that at age  10, I wanted to kill myself to stop the hell I was suffering all alone. I used to wish I was a dog so I couldn't comprehend not existing. I still do. 

Then it stopped. I had more control. I still had them, but very very rarely and only if I thought myself into one. I avoided those thoughts. It worked for years. 

But it's back now. 

I am 17, almost 18. It's much more complicated now. Now, I have come to even worse conclusions. 

*This life is the only experience that I will ever have for all eternity.* One day this will end and then it's nothing and I will never exist or have a consciousness again. That fucking terrifies me. Others take comfort in it. They say, ""Imagine what it was like before you were born."" That doesn't help. That makes it worse. Imagining an eternal state of nonexistence is what gives me the panic attacks in the first place. This is truly fucking it. 

Other thoughts that terrify me and get me in that ""zone"" where I know a panic attack is imminent is trying to comprehend the universe and how it was made, what came before it, how even IS everything existing, and what eternity is.

I don't believe in any God, haven't since I was a child, but honestly I wish I did so it would be easier to deal with death. No wonder humans made up all these gods. Genuinely believing there's another absolutely amazing eternal life with loved ones after you die must make the process a whole lot fucking easier. I wish I had that. I wish I had that so so bad dude. 

I wish I could force myself to truly believe, but that will never happen. I can't even imagine the hell I am going to go through as I near older age and the day I die gets closer, and even worse what I'll go through in my final moments where I am aware I'm dying. I hope someone drugs me the fuck up to the point where I can't know. 

I hope that when I do die, it is swift and immediate and I have no idea it's coming. Hit by a car, gun, explosion, in my sleep, anything that takes me out before I can even comprehend what's happening. That seems to be the only way. Note, *I am NOT suicidal and I DO NOT want to die.* I am simply saying I don't care when or how it happens as long as it happens so fucking fast that I won't have to suffer my own thoughts. 

It is so pointless typing this out, because I know nothing can fix this. That's what scares me so much. There's literally NOTHING anyone can do. It's going to happen no matter what. 

Can anyone else relate to this? I know I can't do anything to prevent the inevitable, but fuck, any ways to make it easier? I used to be terrified of an eternity in hell, but it seems I'm already there."
776,My (22F) relationship with food has been bothering me for years.,"Hello! I am a 22 year old (F) from Saudi Arabia and now I moved to the UK for university. I have always had a love-hate (more of a hate) relationship with food all my life. I am thinking it stems from the trauma I've been through in the past as a child when I went to a school back in Saudi where my teacher probably had issues. She would check every child's lunch box..if a child did not finish his/her food, she would beat them with a stick and give them a big bowl of raw veggies and would not let them go home till they finished it, which is what happened to me pretty much for 3-4 years (pre-school and elementary school up to grade 3) when I attended that school, other kids strangely had no issues with eating food in front of her..while I would tend to take food out of my lunch box and hide all of it inside my bag. 

She would have this stick which she would use to beat me up with every time she found food in my bag. I told my mom to give me only 1 chicken nugget so I wouldn't have a problem eating it/hiding it when I wouldn't feel like eating it while she was around. My parents knew what she did to me and she still did not stop until I finally moved out of the damn school. 

Anyway, now I have a really unhealthy relationship with food. I am very underweight (39.5 kg, 5'3). I want to gain weight so bad but I cannot even finish my food on the plate, I always get full very quickly. I cannot eat in public/in front of people because it triggers my anxiety. I don't think I have issues with my body image (like i'm not trying to lose weight, in fact, i'm trying to gain it and the fact that it's kind of impossible for me to do that makes me hate my body). I don't know what's wrong with me :( it makes me feel so embarrassed and alone."
777,"Being depressed and passively suicidal feels like knowing you're on the wrong bus, but you keep riding it to an unknown destination anyway.

779,Mental healthcare here SUCKS and I’m just sick of it!,"I’m so fed up with trying to talk to a new psych provider. Every time I tell them I take a Xanax HALF MILLIGRAM tablet MAYBE once every other week, they say “we will not be prescribing ANY benzodiazepines.” Like ok that’s not what I want! I get a 30 day supply and it lasts me for like 5-6 months. It’s so frustrating because I’m not a drug addict and I’m not drug seeking and I just want HELP!! My pcp prescribes me my meds but I don’t think they’re the best match for me. I’ve tried so many I won’t even list them. I’m struggling with grief, anxiety, depression, intrusive and obsessive thoughts. I take a Xanax if I’m ruminating on a thought so badly I feel like I can’t breathe and like the walls are about to collapse in on me. It’s like they don’t even wanna listen once they hear the word “benzodiazepine.” It’s like I get treated like I’m just trying to get a script. No I want a diagnosis and actual treatment proper for whatever the fuck is really going on in my brain. 

Just ranting and venting.. any help is appreciated or even someone else who just understands how I feel."
780,Relationship w/ parents after being assaulted,"Two years ago I was assaulted by an ex. All of 2019 was terrible. I was in a legal battle for the house I bought together with my ex and I got laid off from my job. 

Long story short I had a mental break. I felt out of control and had 0 interest in talking to my family (who attempted to be supportive) or my friends. 

Since then I am more stable: I got a job, I’m in therapy, and I work daily on my mental health. The one thing I’m still having issues with is building close relationships specifically with my family. 

I live 30 mins from my parents and my mother constantly ask me to visit our family home but never offers to come to my house... we talk on the phone 1-2 a week 

I have been trying to work on healthy boundaries and determining what I truly want my life to be. 

How do I navigate these family relationships? Especially when I am still working on my own relationship with myself? 

I enjoy time by myself and have been enjoy that aspect of quarantine. I eventually will not be able to use the social distancing excuse to stay home."
781,Reliving trauma following #BLM TW: violence,"Im really sorry if this is the wrong place to post. To start, I am fully in support of black lives matter and am mixed race. I support the protests, the petitions, donations, implementing greater education in schools and punishment for racists, and am doing everything I can to promote the movement on social media, donations and in real life. 
TW: Violence, graphic 

However, is it normal to really struggle reliving trauma from racist bullying.
Growing up, I was beaten horrifically in school because of my race - on a couple of occasions I was required to go to hospital due to damage to my ribs and arm. On a couple of occasions, I was l was locked in the toilets at school and some of the older girls would rip my hair out, spit on me and beat me. During classes, other students would mock my hair, and even pull it out or cut it with scissors.
I would get all the racial slurs thrown at me - “n*****”, “half breed”, “brown bitch”. I was even called the N word when I was 6 by another 6 year old. 
School wouldn’t do anything, police wouldn’t do anything. Eventually my mum moved me to a different school because nothing was happening. This didn’t stop those same students from seeing me about, spitting in my face and shouting slurs at me.

I was made to feel ugly and completely worthless. I began to self harm, developed a serious ED and was hospitalised for my mental health, at this point I’d tried to commit suicide twice.

These same girls now try to follow me on Instagram, complimenting how I look or trying to get me to follow their businesses. It makes me sick how they’ve just expected my forgiveness because times gone by.

Am I right to still be angry? And is it normal / healthy to be reliving these traumas due to everything that’s going on? I hate to post online, but I can’t sleep or eat, I feel sick all the time and dissociated from myself. I’d reinvented myself since I’d left home but now I feel I’ve regressed to the scared child / teenager i once was. I’d really gotten over this and repressed these memories but they’ve all come back.

Can anyone signpost or perhaps share similar stories or coping mechanisms they have for this?"

I love my dad but we get in fights a lot. Today we got in a fight about a garden. He yelled at me. I cry easily. He got angry that I was crying. I’m scared of loud noises and that continued my crying. He got upset that I’m afraid of loud noises. I went inside and started hyperventilating. Everything was getting to be too much. Now I don’t feel like the person typing this right now. I can see I’m typing. But my hands don’t feel like my own. I can feel the the fact that I just scratched my nose. I’m making decisions and doing them but my hands don’t feel attached. My head doesn’t feel attached. Not even my legs feel attached. I feel like I’m just sitting in the back of my mind watching this happen. What is going on. I’m scared."
783,"I’m 23, my brain condition has fucked up my life and I feel lost","Hi, it’s my first time ever posting to this subreddit and I’m a little nervous. But right now I just need somewhere to vent and maybe speak to someone who can help.

The last two years have been really difficult, after neurological appointments I was diagnosed with automatic dysfunction. I loose consciousness everyday and along with some other nasty symptoms. Because of this, I was told I had to leave the job I love. I worked so hard to get where I am and I wanted to keep going. I felt like a failure. 

So I applied to go to university. I went a few years ago but had to drop out because I was too sick to keep going. Until today when my finances were rejected, I can’t go back even if I wanted to. 

I feel so stuck, I feel so lost. I feel like no matter what way I go, my illness keeps stopping me. I don’t want to give up, give in to it being so cruel and damaging. But I just don’t know what to do. I’m disabled, alone and scared. But I want to keep fighting. I don’t know what to do now, where do I go from here? How can I keep fighting?"

786,Need advise on how to move on,"I noticed there are specific sub-reddits but since I struggle with all of the below mentioned I decided to seek help here...

I've been smoking weed for 10 years now. (18 - 28) It slowly consumed my whole being and turned me into a slave. I've tried to quit so many times, deleted numbers, avoided people, flushed it down the toilet only to find myself waking up the next morning with the same thought on my mind. I called dealers on autopilot disregarding and not remembering anything I promised myself last night. When I get high I instantly regret it and feel bad about myself that I keep destroying my health while living in a haze, lost and confused about what I am and where I am heading. I don't even remember who I was before my use. My moods keep swinging back and forth which ultimately hinders my relationships with the people around me. Feeling guilty and having to hide my addiction also brings me down. My family don't deserve this hypocrisy.. I have every reason to quit but keep getting back to it. Lately I limited my use but even a single puff or two makes me feel so anxious!! My brain is so hooked on these chemicals I really urge anyone who is reading this - do not over indulge and be careful how you use it. Weed is much stronger than what is used to be back in 70s for example. It's a huge business and many people, myself included, are just a victim of it.......

Another burden I have is a (mild) stutter which gets worse when I have to talk over the phone or in front of people. It all started when I was a kid during some family quarrel. For some reason I have difficulty talking to my parents (I guess it has something to do with authority). This makes me miserable because I love them so much and have much to say but just can't get the words out. Listening to people talk so effortlessly and smooth gives me great anxiety... I've avoided presentations and speeches my whole life. High school and university wasn't that bad because I managed to escape those situations somehow. I had some rough job interviews though... On my first I blocked so hard I couldn't even make a sound. I will never forget the HR guys staring at me silently not knowing what is wrong. It felt horrible... Maybe I should have told them but I've been hiding it / avoiding to talk about this my whole life, how was I supposed to be up-front about it? Luckily I had more success later, was more fluent on an interview and landed a job. Needless to say, this psychological barrier have most likely led to others, such as anxiety, depression and who knows what else. My confidence, my will to achieve anything in this life or have a healthy relationships have been dying slowly. I know there are much more serious problems and ilnesses out there and I should man up but it hasn't been easy. It's been ruining my life and took away many opportunities. I've tried speech therapy as a kid but didn't get me nowhere so I kind of kept it to myself.

I've also been addicted to porn for years now. I dare to say that I'm good looking, girls like me but lately I rarely have sex because my brain / body don't need it. Porn took away my desire to have a healthy (sex) life. It slowly escalated and I needed more shocking &amp; graphic scenes which made me feel awful about myself afterwards. I now have this partially under control but it's just a click away and the urge to peek is so tempting at times.

A girl I had an affair with some years ago, now has a baby with her new bf. I can only be happy for them but I had mixed feelings arising in me when I first found out. I reminisced about all the missed opportunites when I should have done something, ANYTHING to get her closer to me... All I did was run away, do more drugs and play video games... I'm now in my late 20s and honestly feel like a failure for wasting so much of my life doing nothing and not trying to resolve my struggles. Hiding in my shell surrounded by thick layers of smoke, instead of confronting my problems. 

I've read that stuttering is related to high dopamine levels in the front cortex of the brain. Guess what all those addictions does to your brain? They bathe it with dopamine... I really hope that I didn't fck myself up irreversibly while trying to escape from my problems. If there are medical people here I'd love to read some knowledgeable opinions.

I can go on but won't. Thank you for reading this, hope it's not too overwhelming but it's just how I feel right now. If you have been through the same struggles or have an advise to share I'd love to read it."
787,Do these sound like the symptoms of someone who has ADHD?,"I’ll be doing one thing and then I’ll switch to something else. Like I’ll be watching Netflix, then after a couple minutes I switch to a video game, which I quickly get bored of and switch to something else. This isn’t just entertainment either though. Whenever I’m working on school work I’ll start an assignment and quickly lose focus and start a new assignment, or go to something else that’s completely unrelated to school. I know this isn’t depression or anything like that causing me these focus issues because I’ve been like this ever since I was a child.

I remember in the 2nd grade a teacher had to snap her fingers in front of my face because she could tell I was daydreaming because I was locked on her eyes with no expression on my face.

I also have a bouncing leg that won’t stop bouncing, as well as HORRIBLE organization skills. I STRUGGLE to commit to routine, and I’m often forgetful and have to write shit down that I have to remember.

Does this sound similar to ADHD?"
788,What are your coping strategies for anger?,"Aside from breathing exercises and writing/making music, I find that squeezing a ball is very therapeutic for me. What do you do to overcome your anger?"
789,Anyone else disassociate/get distracted during sex?,I have really bad ADHD and disassociation issues and it sometimes makes sex stuff difficult. My mind will wander or I just won’t feel like it because I don’t feel present or just really detached.
790,Hey dudes I got a question,"I've been feeling very numb for the past year or so with no strong emotions at all.
But suddenly something really bad happened but I don't wanna go into detail it's relationship stuff.
Now I've reverted back to feeling awful to the point of physical sickness and insomnia over something not even too huge.
My question is how can I deal with all my emotions that have been neglected for so long so suddenly.
I've literally been crying over shit as little as getting left on read. I've got huge trust issues and constantly need to know what my partners doing (bcs she got drunk and betrayed trust that's all I'll say) and if not I feel really sick to my stomach and can't handle it.
I feel like there's something wrong with me but I also feel dramatic as hell"
791,I’m tired,I commented on a fb post saying something that people mistook as racist - which I never ever meant for it to be taken that way. Now I have people I haven’t spoken to since high school commenting that I’m racist. And trying to cancel me. I don’t know what to do. I can’t delete the comments or my Facebook or they’ll take that as fear and guilt. I’m just so tired. I want this to stop. I’m doing what I can for the cause. But all people see is this comment. I’m scared and tired.
792,Dad,"Well it's been about 6 years since you passed, man I miss you. I miss sitting at your house playing video games with you. I don't  think that I touched a video game in about 5 years. It just doesn't seem fun without you. I miss our weekly trips to our favorite chinese restaurant. And how you always made fun of how fast I eat. You always told me ""slow down, enjoy your food"" and I always slowed down for like 2 bites then went back to eating fast. I miss riding with you to your golf tournaments and the times we played together. I miss the laughter your brought to the room, I miss how safe I felt. I miss your advice. I miss your voice. I miss your food. Man, I just miss you. I used your golf clubs the other day, I hope you don't mind. I played a really good round with them. 4 under. That was cool even though I new you had somehow helped me from wherever you are. I still struggle with putting btw. I actually went to the golf course our tribe is so happy about. I always hated the back 9 but you know that. It's where you always beat me. I'm still taking care of your house as well. It's in ok shape still. You always told me that if anything happened to you I could live there. But that house always creeped me out at night. The other siblings are doing fine. We get together once in a while, sometimes your name comes up. We all laugh about all the goofy things you did and all the jokes you made. Of the 3 of us I have the trouble of keeping us together. Who knew that your youngest would be the one with the responsible attitude. Crazy I know because you know how everywhere i was. Never had a plan for my days never had a set place I would be. Well man I hope you're doing well wherever you are and I'll talk to you soon man. I miss you so much."

794,How to communicate with a depressed loved one?,"For the longest time I have struggled to talk to anyone about this so I'm hoping someone can offer me another perspective. I (18) have an older sister (27) who has struggled with depression for several years now; it has caused her to have suicidal ideation and has been very debilitating in her life. From a young age she has mainly confided in me as we have always been close but also because there are tensions between her and our parents. In recent years, however, we have grown apart due to sources of conflict such as her unbearable living habits and what i recognise to be poor communication on my behalf. My sister is dependent on my mum financially and domestically yet she treats her very poorly with little respect. She has done things with malicious intent in the past and can show toxic behaviour at times although my mum excuses it as being due to the depression. I have been feeling an inner turmoil these past few years as I cannot bring myself to confront her about the hurtful things she has done, for fear that it might trigger her to hurt herself. I'm afraid that she will misunderstand my anger and fustration at her actions to mean that I no longer love or care for her. This has resulted in me avoiding her out of not wanting to start confrontation yet not being able to act normally as though I think it's acceptable. I'm not sure how to approach the situation as I have social anxiety and I constantly ruminate about how what I say can cause things to go wrong. I have been having recurring nightmares where I have talked to my sister about it and she has taken her own life as a result of what I've said. In the past my sister has said she is only living because of me and so I'm very mindful of how she interprets what i say and how I act towards her. 

 My mum doesn't deserve the way she's being treated and I don't believe my sister's depression can justify the way she treats others. I recognise my passive role has allowed her to continually mistreat my mum while also damaging the relationship between us and I just want to address it in the healthiest way."
795,Can anxiety cause insomnia,"So I find it really hard to fall a sleep, sometimes I would be awke till 8-9 am then sleep.. that thing just started for me.. and I'm not sure if I suffer from anxiety.. and would wake 5-6 hours feeling like I slept for 30 minutes, I'll wake up tired!"
796,Need Advice,"Hi guys, I am 18 (m) 5'7 and I weigh 125lbs and I am perfectly fine and happy with my body (just wish I had abs lolool) . However, every single day my mom finds the need to tell me that I am too skinny and I need to gain weight and eat more. At first, it did not bother me at all but hearing it all the time has really gotten me upset and confused as to why she does this. ALSO growing up I was overweight and chubby and everyone at school would make fun of me and the thought of going back to that terrifies me. I love my mom, I really do. She is very supportive of everything I do (clearly except for my weight lol) and I love her so much but I just want her to stop doing this and just accept me for who I am. I'm just so tired of hearing this every single day "" can you eat more "" , "" omg you are too skinny "" :("
797,Looking for online or local support as I try to go back to school for the 4th time,"I (32M) am in the process of trying to go back to school via distance and online learning to finally finish my business degree. I have acute anxiety, adhd, insomnia and rapid cycle bipolar and am already getting overwhelmed just going through the application and trying to figure out student loans. I don't have a very good support network, mostly just ""acquaintances"" who I can't call on for help.

Was wondering if there are any good support groups, or options for finding people to do check ins with, to help keep me focused and on track and to stop me from succumbing to the feelings of being overwhelmed. This feels like an odd request, but I don't really know how else to find effective support. I am on a wait list for therapy again, but that will take months and I can only afford to go once a month once it starts.

Figured I'd throw this out there to see what options the reddit world has

Also, I am in BC Canada"
798,Current decline and seeing to start medication next week,"Right now I’ve found I’m increasingly bored of living my life. 
I’m 23F, have a decent job and make good money. 
I have a relationship with someone I love with all my heart though I’m beginning to consider the possibility being in a relationship isn’t helping either of us become better people anymore. 
I’ve become sensitive to jokes, I keep overeating because it’s my destructive tactic to binge, besides bruising myself. 
I think I see that boundaries in my relationship will not change and I don’t really know how to be any sadder about it. It crops up frequently and wears me down and has over months now. 
I think if I start medication maybe it’ll make me dwell on these personal problems less as they never seem to heal when all I do is try and think of a solution. I feel overworked in my love life and it’s my fault. 
I’m tired of how I look, when I lose weight it doesn’t make me happy anymore, I hate dressing up just to still think I look bad, I hate where I am in life and how it feels like I’m exhausting the few people that look out/after me. 
I’m struggling with seeing myself as enough right now. 
I keep coming to the conclusion I’d be able to improve if I were alone, though I’m not sure why I think this. 
I feel like I’m stuck and I don’t have any control of anything. 
No one reaches out to me to see how I’m going. 
Not friends or family, I don’t have anyone looking to connect even if I shoot the first message. 
Yeah people get busy but it’s quarantine and you’re all at home with your phones? It doesn’t make me want to talk to anyone I used to anymore. 
I want medication because otherwise I think I’ll break up with my girlfriend. This might happen anyway but if I continue carrying the same patterned thoughts it’s not if but when. 
It’s hard for me to place where I am emotionally. 
This entire year has been challenging beyond the absolute bullshit that’s been ongoing since January which is hard for me to convey. 
I’m so alone and I don’t really look forward to the future. I don’t even think of it anymore. 
I hope medication can help this because this is the worst it’s been so far."
799,Why does this happen,"When I’m very sad and feel like crying nothing comes out, or just a drop in my eye but nothing no tears even though I feel them? I feel emotionless at times and I feel like they are fading every day. I Aldo can’t take myself seriously even when I’m depressed, wanting to kill myself, paranoid or having intrusive thoughts I tel myself to shut up and say stuff like stop acting this and that and then I sometimes laugh, I also laugh when I’m uncomfortable or when people look at me not a big long laugh just a second laugh. Even though I don’t feel like laughing.

I want to cry! I want to cry my heart out I miss the feeling but nothing.
I remember the last time I cried was last year I went to my room and for the first time I cried to myself instead of other people and I cried and put the pillow to my face to stop my winging. Although I hated crying I miss it. I just can’t take myself seriously, I can’t cry and can’t be serious I don’t know what’s going it even writing this now I feel stupid."
800,Why am I embarrassed to ask for help,I deal with depression a lot and my boyfriend and family know I deal with it but never at the time. I can never just say “I don’t want to be alone right now” I’m not sure why. I’m going through a lot of depression right now and I’m afraid to ask for help. Maybe because I’m not even sure what would help. Does anyone else do this?
801,"Some use social shields to hide their struggle, don’t judge a book by its cover!",
802,Volatile siblings,"My family has a bad genetic history of mental illness and depression going back to at least my great grandmother. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for the last ten years, and my older sister has anxiety. When she gets upset, she very quickly lashes out at me when I'm around. Normally we live apart, with me finishing college and her starting her career in a different city, but due to the virus we're both at home with our parents. She's going through a stressful time in her life, and I feel really terrible for her. She is just trying to start her career, and due to the virus and resulting recession there aren't any jobs to be found in her field. Naturally, this is extremely depressing for her. However, what I'm not ok with is that she becomes just plain sarcastic, condescending and rude with me when she gets upset. I'm a quiet and generally shy person who doesn't really speak up for myself much, so I'm probably just an easy target for her to do that. When I finally told her today that I didn't like the tone she was taking with me, she stormed off. I even tried to apologize (not sure why since I was standing up for myself). I'm going through the really crappy process of applying to medical school right now and am stressed out about things in my own life, and it doesn't feel fair to me to have to deal with my own problems while also being a punching bag for her and not being able to say anything. I'm just not sure what to do anymore. Does anyone have any experience of dealing with siblings who act like this? It's irritating being the younger sibling and feeling like I have to be the only adult 100% of the time."
803,anyone can talk right now?,i really need someone to talk at this time. please.
804,What’s the point of doing this lockdown if there are protests everywhere and I’ve felt suicidal?,"I miss people. Social activity was my sustenance. I’m such a people person but now I feel broken. I’m not myself at all, and I’ve had bad mental health struggles in the past, had them in check for a long time, and now I’m in the deepest setback yet.

I can’t express how I feel. It’s a combination of emptiness, sadness, anger, and being totally out of energy. I’m self-destructing at a worrisome rate. I have been diagnosed with bipolar, and then re-diagnosed with depression. The meds had too bad of side effects to be worth it. I went through years of therapy and it eventually did work. I was better. For *years*. And I am so close to graduating, and finally starting my life, and then the bullshit of 2020 had to happen, and it’s so *frustrating* to be back to this hopeless state, except even more hopeless than before. I at least had the support of people then.

I won’t commit suicide, because a friend did it and I saw the impact it had on everyone and myself. I can’t do that to my loved ones. But I have been utterly infatuated with the idea and, god, I just feel so broken. I can’t do this.

Zoom calls are unsatisfying. The media pumps negative news constantly. People everywhere are angry. Seeing people with masks and social distanced really makes me irrationally upset.

I am so utterly done with all this. I feel like I have to go to a mental institution, but I have priorities I can’t let slip. I just feel indescribably broken and I don’t know what to do :( :( :("
805,Coping with Life,"

Life for me is really challenging, i love challenges and i love overcoming them but there’s an obstacle of life i can’t overcome. The template for our life is not ours, your life is basically predetermined since you were born. Go to school, get a job, get married, get a house, have kids, retire, die. Looking at life as it currently stands I’m in the same shoes of millions before where i look out at the horizon of my life and can see nothing but 40 hour work weeks doing something i don’t wanna do, not living life to its potential, and staying caught in the vicious cycle of needing currency to get absolutely anywhere in life. Doing what i do now doesn’t let me enjoy life and I’m even not all there mentally when I’m not working. I’m tired, I’m exhausted. Not even of just taking calls from my living room but having my life revolve around working for people who have way more money than me and do way less work. It’s an almost unbearable thought, 3 years of working and thinking is “this going to be my life?” Am i going to miss my children growing up because I’m at work? Or am i just going to continually suffer from depression and stress while killing myself doing monotonous tasks. 

It’s definitely the world around me as well, it gets to me. The uncertainty of the world right now has me in so much disarray, i have no control over what’s going on around me, but it’s scary and i don’t like it and there’s no way to turn it off. Our world is governed by people who aren’t with us they are against us and now we live in such a chaotic hostile environment with an uncertain future with rioting and pandemics. Even after the pandemic what’s going to happen? Do we just go back to regular life? Or is there a new regular for us now. It’s scary because no one knows and there’s no answers anywhere as hard as you look. 

We come into this earth with no understanding and only understand what we are told, then you grow up and realize there are no answers. No one knows why were here, no one knows if there’s a god. No one knows. So life is constantly surrounded by people trying to uncover the meaning of life and you intake hundreds of theories and guess just to see that no one really has any idea why we are and what we are. We’re aimless and our life only has purpose when it’s given purpose. But what’s our purpose? Unless your the top 1% your going to work 87 days a year combined. If you work for 50 years 25% of that time alive is working. That’s a disaster. Life becomes about material possessions to make life easier and more convenient and in trade less time living life and enjoying what actually matters. 

It’s not to say I’m not thankful either, I’m incredibly thankful for the people in my life and i wouldn’t be where i am without them. I have an incredible girlfriend who loves me and huge family with so many siblings who i adore and endless people in my life who are there for me whenever i need. If i need anything i have amazing people there for me and I’m incredibly thankful to have every single one of them in my life. I have great managers and great co workers, i have a decent car and all the materiel possession I’ve wanted since i was 13 and now what. I understand money doesn’t bring you happiness and the only thing that will is gratefulness and love. But somehow with everything i have around me and all the people who i have near me and i still feel alone and trapped in the cruel joke of this world. 

I feel like  with everything i have i should be happy. I have all the tools with me, but still i a not. Still i have thoughts of ending my life and leaving it all behind because if i do that, there are no consequences, just immediate relief. I no longer need to worry about rent or work or not being good enough because at that point I’m no longer here to deal with the mental burdens of this world. I don’t wanna die, i wanna be happy. I swear I’ve looked everywhere and to everyone but can’t find my own way to be content. Life just seems like it’s making the best out of a bad situation and this world has shown be every reason and emotion to not be apart of it anymore. I’m sure a lot of people feel this way as well but I’m just having a tough time coping with life.

806,I have a big problem with my mood swings since I've began to take a smaller dose of Zoloft.,"Could it be because I'm taking a smaller dose or maybe smth else? I'm confused because some people say that Zoloft can be quitted anytime and nothing should gone wrong. 
However, I begin to take a smaller dose like 2 weeks ago. First few days I had some mood swings but it wasn't really that bad. Then the next few days were absolutely brilliant without mood swings at all... and this week... is terrible. I just go from happy and even euphoric into the extremely angry or sad being. I even began to have troubles with sleeping because I feel extreme rage and anxiety in a way I want to harm myself."

808,Grew Up Poor - Spending Excessive Time Planning,"
Hi guys

I grew up in very, very difficult circumstances and due to hard work and good luck and grace, have managed to do very well in life. However, it seems that I am having a difficult time finding joy and satisfaction in what I have at times.

Currently, we are a young 25-30 year old couple with significant savings. We have been the picture of responsibility but I find myself constantly checking accounts and counting things and worrying if we are going to be okay. I also honestly don’t feel as left behind while my friends finance million dollar homes and sports cars since I know they are bad decisions But what hurt me is finding out that someone else in my field makes 8x as much as I do. I am currently in therapy for the difficulties I faced growing up (which led to anxiety and trauma) but I am hoping for some wisdom since I can’t seem to find much help in therapy for this particular issue since we have so much other crap to sort through.

How do I stop being obsessive about planning. It really helped me survive in life (both literally and figuratively) but now it’s holding me back. I’d like some help."

810,I have my first psychiatrist appointment on Tuesday and I’m worried my problems aren’t big enough for this.,"My wife and I see a marriage counselor, and she heavily recommended I get a psych eval after I opened up about feelings of depression and my new habit of binging and purging. She specifically mentioned depression and OCD. She recommended we pause marriage counseling as it’s incredibly difficult to work on a couple when one of them has what could be mental health issues. I’ve been excited at the prospect of getting answers and treatment for my problems, but now that it’s nearing I’m worried that my problems are too minuscule to be concerning this much over them.


I have a problem with binging and purging after failing to maintain a healthy lifestyle. I lost 60lbs and gained it all back and more during a depressive streak. I’ve had suicidal thoughts but never desires to actually end my life. I have bouts of anger. These all seem too superficial and I’m worried a psychiatrist is going to agree and I’ll leave with no answers and no starting block to recovery.

If anyone here has had similar anxiety, or even experienced these same kind of issues, any input would be appreciated. I know well enough that these thoughts are probably just anxiety, but it’s hard to shake."
811,"Dealing with the lowest self-esteem/confidence I've felt in a long, long time. Please help me turn it around","In January I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years. It was the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do. For a while I was messed up from it, understandably. The Covid lockdown has obviously made it virtually impossible to meet new people and to try and get over this breakup. I know that, and so I'm trying to take it easy on myself, but for the past couple months I've felt more and more like a loser. 

This is tough to admit, but even though I had a girlfriend for 6 years, I'm still a virgin. We did plenty of sexual stuff, but never actually had sex (issues on her end with fear/guilt, things that I would never blame her for, so I obviously never pushed it). I know it's probably not the biggest deal in the world, but I can't lie that it bugs me to no end. My 27th birthday is in a few weeks, and I can't believe I'm going to be a 27 y/o virgin. 

I don't think I'm very good looking. I'm shy, and getting more so as time goes on. I guess I don't think people will like me, so I never really try to be friends or let people in, and I have a tough time telling if my friends even like me or if they're simply tolerating me. Both of these situations makes it tough to really let go and be myself. 

My friend group right now is not the best. I feel bad about myself when I'm around them. I know I need to cut them out, but my roommate has them over all the time. At this point I just try to ignore anything they say, but I know I'm going to need to speak up at some point. 

I guess I've always had low self-esteem, but it's definitely gotten worse since becoming single. Covid lockdown hasn't helped, being stuck in my house with just my thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I don't like myself very much, and I need help to change that. I know confidence and a sense of self-worth comes from within, but I'm really having trouble finding it within myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance for any help."
812,How do you respond when someone tells you to just stop being sad?,"There are some people who will try to tell me that if I want to stop being sad then I can just simply stop it. This makes no sense to me because if I could put an end to my struggles by such simple logic, obviously I would. How do you respond to someone who says this?"
813,"Depressed, feeling like I'm a total asshole","I'm a married woman that works in a help desk at a military installation where my coworkers are all guys. I've worked at the same place for four years now. I struggle with PCOS, moderate depression, anxiety and general low self esteem. The last two years have been really rough and I had to start seeing a therapist and taking some mild medication to help out with the depression. 

The last two years have been rough because that is when I discovered that I had feelings for a coworker (who I'll call D for anonymity) who works in a different workcenter than me. I would interact with them occasionally in the course of doing my job. At first I denied that I felt that way, I thought that I just saw him as attractive. When I started thinking about him all the time though, I began feeling exceeding awkward dealing with them at work. This coworker had done nothing to encourage how I felt and at first I felt embarassed, then ashamed and guilty for my feelings. There were a couple of times that i had sent this coworker emails just asking them how they were doing (and not work related in nature at all). I have never solicited this coworker for anything sexual but I still felt like a creep. I ended up working it out so that anything that he needed from me work-wise would go through my manager. I stopped all other communciation and tried to avoid his office at all times. For a while, this seemed to work just fine but then I started getting majorly depressed at the thought of not being able to see and/or talk to them. This would in turn trigger feelings of worthlessness because I felt like it was a betrayal against my husband, who I didn't want to hurt with this. 
Since I started avoiding that specific coworker, I started getting to the point that I was avoiding just about everyone else as well (particularly if they were male), with the exception of my husband, my boss and a few people that both my husband and I both know together and talk to. This has caused me significant stress at work as the coworkers in my workcenter don't really like me because I don't say hello or otherwise talk to them. Whenever my boss had a potluck in the office, I don't participate. I just buy my food from somewhere else, bring it to my desk and eat quietly, most of the time with headphones on to listen to music. They don't usually look at me or pay attention to me, but sometimes I have caught them giving me glares or just a blank expression when I walk past them in the hallways or in the office. I have nothing against them, but I felt like due to what happened with ""D"" that I can't even interact with them without feeling guilty and ashamed. It has gotten so bad that when I come into the office, I start feeling really tense. None of my coworkers acknowledge me and I walk past quickly without saying anything and get to the safety of my desk (which is on the other side of the wall from the other coworkers in my office). There are two other coworkers and my boss who sit on the other side of the wall with me and I am able to have brief conversations with them but only when we are both on that side of the office.
I feel like that if they only understood my situation, then maybe they would see it differently but due to the nature of the situation and so as to not further embarrass ""D"", I can't try to explain any of that to them. The only thing I did tell them one day was that I do struggle with depression and that it makes me want to avoid people. I think they understood what I meant and they seemed to be somewhat sympathetic but as the days of silence went on, it seemed like things just reverted to what they were. I told my boss that I was having an issue being able to talk/work with my office colleagues and he just told me that I need to put myself at there more; say hi, ask them how they are doing and general conversation. My boss doesn't know about the situation with ""D"". 
I feel like my only option here is to give up this position and go work somewhere else where I can start with a clean slate. I just get the general impression that everyone sees me as an asshole for avoiding everyone. It just feels like I'd be doing everyone and myself a favor by leaving. I don't know how I can interact with everyone again without that fear of judgment and I don't know how to proceed without me making things worse then they already are."
814,Don’t know how to tell my friends I attempted,"This is a throwaway cause my friends know my account. Major content warning for sexual assault/suicide

I was sexually assaulted when I was 15 by another girl who had invited me over. We kissed, and she wanted to go further, but I said no. She blocked her door and wouldn’t let me leave, she started crying and screaming, and because of my anxiety I froze and just let her do what she wanted. The whole time I cried and asked her quietly to stop, then I was silent and just let it happen so it would end. I went home that night and cried in the shower for hours. This happened multiple times, any time she could corner me on my own she would force me to do things I wasn’t okay with. I tried to tell myself that because we had kissed, what she was doing was okay. 

I was in trauma counselling for two years afterwards, I never felt comfortable alone in a room with someone, and felt so nauseated by romantic and sexual scenes in movies that I couldn’t watch them. When I began dating again, the first time I tried to be intimate with my boyfriend I had flashbacks that caused me to have a panic attack. 

My therapist told me it might be helpful to tell my friends what this person had done, so I did. I wrote a two page word document explaining the basics, as I felt too overwhelmed to go into detail. I sent it to a groupchat my friends were in. 

A girl in the group who was friends with my abuser added her to the group. The person who had hurt me so badly years ago then began to control the narrative. She admitted to pressuring me through huffing and getting angry with me, she admitted to knowing my anxiety caused me to freeze and comply, but she claimed it was all okay because I “liked it”. She claimed I asked her to do things to me (I didn’t, I asked her to stop.) I felt so sickened reading her tearing me apart that I threw up. That night I self harmed the worst I have in years.

A few days later, after trying to get myself admitted and being ignored by the crisis team, I attempted suicide. I overdosed on my antidepressants and got blackout drunk. I went to sleep hoping I’d never wake up again. It didn’t work.

I woke up and threw up at about 3am. I vomited for what felt like hours but it was only about half an hour. I had a drink of water, and I went to sleep again. I woke up the next morning feeling awful, but alive. I cried all morning wishing I’d stayed asleep.

Its been a few weeks since then. I regret what I did. I have been on and off the phone with Samaritans and my therapist. I felt so entirely alone in the moment, but I hated myself for attempting. I still feel so angry that I almost threw everything away over a person who wouldn’t care one bit if I was gone. My boyfriend, my real friends, my dad, my little brother, they all would have been crushed if I died. 

I feel I should tell my friends, but I’m terrified about what they’ll say. I’m scared they won’t believe me. I’m scared I’ll be called a liar again. Worse I’m afraid they’ll be devastated. That they’ll call and text me at all hours to make sure I’m alive. That they’ll stay awake worrying that it’s too late. I wish I could just disappear, and have everyone forget me. Then they wouldn’t hurt so much.

I know this is incredibly long. But it’s what I needed to say right now. I’m scared about what will happen if I don’t start talking about how alone I feel. If anyone has read this far, thank you for listening to me."
815,Doing more harm or good?,"I live(d) in a predominately white suburban neighborhood growing up with very conservative parents. During this BLM movement, I have vocalized my support to my parents, and publicly, for black lives and against police brutality. I have made strides with my dad to get him to understand but we have always but heads when it comes to political views. Anyway, I commented on my dad's Facebook post with police killings based on race saying it doesn’t take into consideration the American population percent by race and asking him to put his source too. Then a guy who died from my college's father commented back to me saying "" Why don't you ask \*insert son's name\* how he feels."" 

Backstory: his son was murdered by two black men in a drug deal gone wrong that he was technically not apart of 

I deleted my comment and had my dad delete his comment to me and then I private messaged him.  I didn’t even know his son but I feel so so sad and bad that not only is his anger valid that people did not react like this when his son died but he is so blinded by the hateful act his son endured he doesn’t see that not only was that not the point of my comment, it’s not the point of the moment. And that one violent and awful awful act does not define a race or excuse the corrupt system.

Honestly, I don't know what I want to get out of this post other than thank you for hearing me vent. I feel that being an empath is a blessing and a curse but the feeling of holding the weight on your shoulders is not fun nor is there ever a perfect solution. 

If you made it this far thank you."
816,DID a bit lost,"I've been in therepy for about 5 years now, taking meds for depression and mood stabilizers for about 6-7. I'm a 25 year old male and my therepist and psychiatrist are leaning towards a diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder. Its a scary diagnosis for me, we think I have anywhere from 3 to 5 ""alters"" I guess they're called. It's a strange disorder for me to consider myself as having considering the few statistics I've read about it. It usually affects 1-2% predominantly women so as a male it make me feel even more alone. I recently lost my partner because my symptoms were too hectic for her to handle and I understand that she had to leave to maintain her own mental health, but I'm afraid for probably the first time in my life. Ive never had an answer to what's I guess, wrong with me, but now that I know it's terrifying, there's so much about the disorder that I don't know, and I've never known how to handle myself. Amnesia and having people drive me that also me is strange. I can't find the motivation to work or do much of anything. I feel like I'm sinking, the added stress is just causing me to dissociate more. I know that maybe knowing that I have it only makes the symptoms worse possibly temporarily but I've lost all control over my presence, I feel so unconscious 90% of the time. I guess I came here to say it's strange and I'm scared and I feel alone.... Lmao so I guess I'm just here to complain. Sorry about that."

819,"Hello, I’m in need of some ED-related advice!","Hello everyone!

I hope you’re all doing well and that your evenings/days are all off to a wonderful end/start. 

I’ve been researching various sorts of treatments for eating disorders.  Specifically partial hospitalisation, inpatient, residential, etc.  

I was wondering if anyone knows of any tips or tricks patients employ whilst partaking in one of those treatment methods in order to maintain their weight upon arrival or avoid meals? 

People seem to mention them vaguely often, but I’ve never actually heard the specifics. 

It’d be great appreciated if any of you could help sate my curiosity. 

Thank you.

820,"Literally can’t talk anxiety, is there a name for that?","Hi all, I’m almost 30 and I’ve had anxiety and depression my entire life. Most of my early childhood into early adulthood was spent feeling pretty suicidal, but I finally started getting better a year or two ago. However, my only insurance is through the VA and the therapists available to me aren’t helpful.. at all (Ive heard “breath, count 5 things, and don’t drink caffeine“ as the cure all for my problems for almost a decade now) so I wanted to ask here

I have a really hard time in social situations. I’m awkward and all that good stuff, but can usually think of something to say. However there are times when my mind just goes completely and 100% blank. Not like I know what I want to say and can’t say it - more like literally nothing is happening and I’m just frozen and stuck. Something got jammed in the gears up there, they aren’t turning kind of stuck.

This has caused a million arguments in my relationships and broken a few. I’ll be told to speak my mind or it will be expected of me to be saying something during a disagreement and nothing will go through my head. This is also a big problem with communicating about sex, which I haven’t had a great time with in the past. I will get told to “Say something” or asked “what do you want” and literally nothing comes to mind. I feel myself struggling to say anything or even Think of anything to say and nothing happens. In conversations or arguments, I’ve even felt myself getting mad trying to just open my mouth and at least make some kind of noise of acknowledgement that i am listening and i can’t even do that. 

People don’t believe me no matter how much I’ve tried to explain that my mind is blank and I can’t make myself speak no matter how bad I want to. They think I’m exaggerating. Please tell there is a specific name for this thing that has happened all my life. I want to look into it more 

To add, this unfortunately doesn’t seem to be a thing that I can just get better at. I was in the military for a few years and while other areas of my self-confidence improved, including public speaking in general, this has always remained the same."
821,Concerned for my mental health and resilience.,"I've always had pretty good mental health. I've only ever seen a psychologist to get through temporary difficulties in my life (work/study stress, family problems etc.) and haven't needed ongoing mental health support once those issues have resolved (more or less). 

I have pretty unlimited social support, particularly from my mother and my partner, who are always there for me. I am in a loving and happy relationship, am planning a wedding for next year, graduated from my dream degree and got a great job 14 months ago with excellent long term prospects. And yet, despite all this support and care, I have never felt lower in my work during the past 3 months.

At work, we move around departments every few months for training purposes. The last few months I've been working in a department with good regular hours (40 hour working weeks), (mostly) supportive bosses, and ok co-workers. And yet I have never felt so dissatisfied with my work. It had no meaning, I disagreed with how the department was run, and the culture in this department is notoriously negative. There's no bullying or individually-targeted negativity, but no one wants to be there and people feel generally frustrated by the processes of the department. 

This had a much bigger impact on my mental health than I expected. I became exhausted, lost interest and energy for my hobbies and exercise, my mood became low, I wanted to sleep all the time and I felt like a robot getting up and going to work every day, I even noticed myself restricting my food intake at one point. 

I leant heavily on my partner for support (which he provided in abundance) and tried to focus on the positives in my life like planning my wedding, which only helped a little. Thankfully, my placement in this department was always temporary (10 weeks) and it's coming to an end (so light at the end of the tunnel - I've already noticed an increase in my mood and energy levels), but I've become very concerned about my resilience to work dissatisfaction.

Despite all the supports and good mental health I've had, despite the regular hours and generally supportive bosses, the meaninglessness of the work and the way the department is run had such a strong impact on my mental health. I'm concerned because I feel like I've gone through some things (moving half-way across the world when I was 20, being estranged from my dad, severing toxic friendships) without nearly as much difficulty, and yet a standard 9-5 job with no individual toxicity made me fall apart this like and I don't understand why. I'm mainly concerned about it happening again because we're consistently moving every 2-3 months and it's possible (even likely) I'll end up in another (or the same) department with a negative culture. 

I guess I'm just wondering whether anyone else has been caught by surprise at how they've reacted to environmental stressors that they didn't think would be such a big deal. And if so, if there's anything they found they could do to prevent it a second time."
822,[Need advice] I have seriously lost my inner voice,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit, because I just need someone to listen. Over the last two years, I've had a lot of traumatic experiences (homelessness, abuse from both separated parents, terrible work environment, etc) and I've lost a lot of trust in people in general. 

Strangely enough, I don't feel as suicidal as I have felt when I was living with my mother (when I was underaged). But something else has taken over my mental state. I'm constantly not happy and yet not sad and yet not content and yet not overly depressed. 

It's like a mini depression, mixed with anxious thoughts and lack of focus. I've been living like this for months now, and I haven't even realised how it's affected me. 

I remember when I was younger, I had this confident inner voice that analysed and interpreted everything around me. With this inner voice, I felt like I was a smart, intelligent person. I was confident and strong even when I had moments of depression and suicidal thoughts. Slowly it's disappeared after the many traumatic experiences I've had. 

Now, I don't even know how I feel most of the time. What is this? What can I do that'll have long-lasting effects?"
823,Maybe its corona?,"I don't necessarily like to talk about how Im feeling because I don't like to make a big deal of things. I just kinda want to rant get something off my chest thats rather anonymous. I  feel like the past few days I've been really confusing myself and behaving in ways I shouldn't be acting I guess. Also adding I've done somethings I probably shouldn't have done. And the thing is it's like I never care what people think about me at all and now all of the fucking sudden I do. This for real doesn't make sense at all, but this is how my mind is currently working. Like I feel like I have to be vague because like I've given myself so much anxiety over practically nothing. Am I even making sense rn?"
824,spikes in anxiety over the last year,"Hey guys. Sorry for posting this from a throwaway, hope you understand. 

I’ve been dealing with some crippling anxiety for the last three years that has made me lethargic and bitter. I guess I just want to talk about it though I am not really seeking any specific answers to questions. 

I remember back before the summer of 2017, following my junior year of college, I was a coolest cat in town. I had wholesome relationships and I found myself to be emotionally supportive to those I cared for. Despite this I just didn’t feel intellectually fulfilled. I became increasingly unsatisfied with my career trajectory and I knew I had to make a sudden change. 

I spent that summer working full time, studying for the GMAT, and taking online courses. I hustled so hard that summer I ghosted my dearest friends and ended my relationship at the time.

Professionally and academically, however, it was quite worth it. I got into Columbia U for a masters program, the only one I applied to. I spent my senior year of college finish strong and otherwise preparing for the program, and during the program I prepared for the workforce. It was worth it as I found my dream job before graduation with masters in 2019. Don’t get me wrong, I had a blast during this time, and I met so many lifelong friends I’ve come to cherish. All the same, however, the state of unease in the continuous grind slowly wore me down emotionally.

I was so stressed during school that I was literally sent to ER and later hospitalized after my immune system collapsed (I am otherwise pretty physically healthy albeit skinny as of late). 

Having worked for the last year, I picked up yet another grind to finish up student loans. Over the last twelve months, I have paid back $50,000 in student loans. I will finish the remaining $8,000 in two months from now. I know this grind is voluntary, but I _really_ hate debt, and I’ll be so glad to be free of it.  

I can’t believe I am so close to finishing the last of my goals I had initially planned back in 2017, but now I am increasingly worried that I have become an entirely different person since then. 

My anxiety has been particularly bad over the last several months during lockdown. I find myself rather impulsive and needy. I am not nearly as kind and socially graceful as I remember being... I feel like I can’t really talk about myself and my current goals/aspirations, especially because of how taboo personal finances can be. I am so bitter and pessimistic now despite having been rather generous and emotionally supportive in the past. 

I have everything I could have ever wanted yet I feel like the husk of my former self. Now that I am finally approaching the end of my grind, I am just trying to seek some comfort and normalcy and I am scared I won’t be able to."
825,Really struggling - depression &amp; anxiety - can't cope at all,"I'm struggling a lot at the moment. At the beginning of this year, I did some group therapy for depression and it was going well. I felt ok and was getting better. Then Coronavirus hit, I moved to working from home and all my leisure activities were cancelled. My depression for really bad and I was having anxiety attacks a lot because of work. I struggle with working from home even before this, I tend to avoid it. I find it very difficult to communicate online with my colleagues. 

Things got so bad that I took a few days off work to try and relax but I couldn't. I ended up going to my GP and getting signed with sink. I still have 2 more weeks off, I want to go back after that but really not sure if I'll cope.

I've been talking with my GP and the local therapy service but it feels like I'm not getting the help I need. They make me do a questionnaire to assess my depression over the last 2 weeks. It's seems that despite the fact it says I have very severe depression, they aren't taking me seriously because I'm not suicidal and I don't self harm. My sibling who I'm very close with, was depressed a few years ago and I know how terrible I felt thinking about what would happen if they were suicidal, I couldn't put them through that, no matter how bad I'm feeling. 

Only my work and my partner know about my problems with depression. I haven't talked with my family about it. I want to but I don't know how. My mum worries a lot and it's bad enough right now with her not seeing me in over 3 month's. I'm worried if I tell her, she will be too worried about me and will constantly try to do things to help which actually becomes more of a problem. I know she means well but it causes a lot more stress for me. 

I'm also not sure how to talk to my family as it's been going on for so long now. I don't know how they would feel to find out I wasn't telling them for 6 weeks. I just don't know what to do. 

I'm sorry for the long post. I don't feel like I have much support at the moment. I don't know what to do."
826,Feeling unsupported and alone,"My bf and I had an argument a few days ago because I boiled over after a week of depression. I don’t want to call it a manic episode, but I felt that maybe it was. I was detached from what was happening and took things so personally. We made up, I apologized and things were fine. Then today when I went to the ER for stomach pains, I had a gallbladder scare and I was trying to find someone to watch my dog. I asked my bf first but said that if he couldn’t, I’ll ask my friend.

The night before, he told me I was distracting him from making music, so I didn’t want to be a bother to him and get in his way. He took it too personally that I’d confide in someone else. He ignored my texts when I told him that I didn’t mean to offend him and hung up on me when I tried to call and explain to him that I had no ill intentions and I knew he’d be there for me; I didn’t want to be a distraction. I’ve been having a lot of medical problems the past month and he’s helped me a lot, so I felt terrible subjecting him to my problems again. 

He’s not here tonight, but he did apologize and admitted he was jealous / was being selfish. I feel incredibly confused over the situation. I posted in r/amitheasshole while waiting in the ER and the replies made me feel better, but I’m in a bad headspace from it as well. I love him, but I’m so scared that he’s just not going to understand me at all. I don’t want to break up with him because he makes me really happy, but this isn’t the first misunderstanding on his part, and I doubt it’s the last time he’ll make me feel like an asshole.

My grandmother called me tonight to make sure I was ok and I miss her so much. She’s my mom as well. I wish I could get out of this town and see her, but corona and the fact that she’s over on the west coast makes it impossible. I feel broken up and as much as I’m trying to distract myself, I’m feeling alone and heartbroken. I want everything to level out again. It’s been over a week now and my gut is wrenching constantly. I can’t work out because of my back issues, I’ve actually developed ulcers from the stress and I’m consistently in a healing state. I dunno what to do with myself but try and sleep it off. I’m tired of crying, feeling alone, feeling guilty and losing motivation. I haven’t thought about suicide in a long time. While I won’t commit to that, I don’t like these intrusive thoughts; they’re eating me up."
827,[vent/rant] feeling worthless and hopeless,"So this is my first post to this subreddit and I hope I'm not posting out of place. 

For the past couple of years I have been feeling very down on myself. I got kicked out of college, watched my friends graduate and get jobs and obtain careers to self sustain themselves. I've felt like I've wasted three years of college, such as my time and my parents time/money, and I've gotten no where as a result. 

I've had trouble talking about my feelings with my friends because they ""never knew how to help me"". Just now I was texting back and forth with a friend and he just stopped texting me. 

I feel like people replace me or don't care about me. I just got my college tassle for completing college after 7 years and no one seems to really care. 

To be frank the more I write this the less I want to talk about my issues because I don't think anyone would care in the end anyways. I barely can get people I know invested in how I feel."
828,Thinking about my rapist,"I was raped about a 13 months ago by a obese black man off Grindr. If there is one thing you should never do, its use sex as a form of validation which is what I did.  When I lost my friends I turned to any source of validation and that was the only. Fused together with my decaying sense of self worth and beauty, which stemmed from my friend backstabbing me for her abusive ex, and led me to letting a old man rape me in my own home. Fuck him. I hope he burns in hell. And I guess this makes it all equal? I shared my ex's secret and now I've allowed anyone to know my shameful dark secret that I was a horny depressed loser."

Absentee seizures they are called, I cant drive, cant go for a walk alone. Soon nothing sounded fun anymore and now the only thing I enjoy is tending my garden and playing a little call of duty. I have been having mood swings and due to lack of purpose and meds not seeming to work, a wish to live. I wanna feel well enough and strong enough to lift weights again, I wanna be able to drive myself again. Some days I'm my normal jovial self, on others I hate everything for no reason or petty reasons. Now it's gotten out of control last few days my wife has been working late due to short staffed and I've been alone with my thoughts. A neighborhood stray destroyed my garden and then the game I was playing held back updates due to the riots. I'm not mad about a game or some plants I'm angry because the last bastion of enjoyment I had was destroyed. Now all I can think about is revenge. I know I shouldn't think this way but it's there gnawing at me. Grind up some glass in some meat and leave it for that bastard dog. Throw some rocks at cops from the crowd so those protesters get pelted. I dont understand what's wrong with me, I dont hate dogs I've had them all my life. I dont hate black people I helped raise my mixed niece and nephew not to mention all the girls I've dated.  I DONT WANNA FEEL LIKE THIS I WANT TO BE HAPPY AND NORMAL AGAIN."

I don't know why.  I feel tired enough to sleep. My eyes feel scratchy and dry, same with the throat.  Body gets tired and sometimes extremely cold. I Gerry shook the normal ""I'm tired and need to sleep"" symptoms but, when I lay down I'm wide awake and for hours. Sometimes the entire night. Then I spend the entire next day barely able to function. I've been calling ot a lot lately because I just want to lay in bed all day because I couldn't sleep last night.  I don't always sleep in the day. Occasionally but not every time. Sometimes I go to work and power through so I'll be tired enough to sleep that night. It doesn't always work. I've tried everything.  Sleeping pills don't even always work. I just don't know why this is happening."
834,My friend is in need,"Hello Everyone.  My friend who goes by the name Kareem hasn't been normal for the past few months.  I really wish I could post something like a link here to show you what I mean but I can't.  He sent me around 40 photos of writing he had done in his ""notebook"".  These were writings about how entities that others couldn't see were controlling his life.  He wrote a lot about a girl names Alyssa.  I don't know Kareem irl or what has been happening but from what i read, this girl lied about him or to him or something along those lines.    


He does take drugs and is addicted to them, as well as his sleep being messed up because of this.  His drug of choice is adderall (or however you spell it).  He writes about how he has to ""leave"" and ""run away"" but that ropes are holding him down to earth.  About how he must ascend in a sense.  I'm worried for him, and one of our mutuals names Catt is too.  Please, give us some sort of clarity."

836,Coping without suicidal tendencies as a safety net,"Hiya! I realize this is a weird title, and I apologize for making a throwaway account, but I didn’t want to risk anything. So lil background info, I’m F(17) who has suffered from mental illness since the age of 8, but in the past year I’ve been medicated and have gotten so much better and have overcome my past suicidal tendencies (yay!) the only thing is, now that something recent traumatic has happened, I don’t necessarily know how to cope without being suicidal. It’s sorta hard to explain, but in the past when I’d face trauma, I would be in the mindset of “okay well it doesn’t matter how I cope with this, I’m just gonna kill myself anyway” and I never truly coped with it. But now that I’m no longer suicidal, I’m facing this trauma in a way that’s new to me, because I no longer can push it aside and resort to suicide. I guess in a way I’ve lost a safety net? (Although suicide isn’t safety but hopefully my point gets across ;;) is this an issue anyone else has faced, and if so do you have any advice? (I plan on discussing this with my therapist soon, but I just sorta wanted to get opinions now ^^)"

My dad has a stroke 3 years ago and is alone in a care home and has been for 4 months now. My best friend is all wine in Manchester and I'm worried about his safety. Along with this I've been having my own health issues which has caused me to be rushed to hospital for urgent rehydration. 

All of this is playing on my mind all the time and starting to become increasingly uncontrollable. It's caused me to become closed off, nervous and just generally not that fun to be around. My girlfriend has started to notice and I've discussed it with her but it still effects me and has the knock on of affecting our sex life which has never happened to be before.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you Reddit  for being here for a man in need."
839,"I feel like my brain is blurring the line between fantasy and reality to protect me from my overwhelming sense of powerlessness, despair and self-loathing. My gaming addiction is the only thing keeping those floodgates shut. It has to stop."," I've been blessed (cursed?) with a  powerful imagination in which I've spent many a sleepless night as a  child, and in which I still spend a lot of time to this day. Be it  yearning for greener pastures while stuck in a retail job I hate,  dreaming of a better partner when mine is being a jerk, wondering how  things would go if I had godlike powers, or just off in a world in which  I have the freedom to do and be anything I please. When I come back to  the real world I am forced to concede how impossible what goes on in my  head is. And all I'm left with is this... chronic, generalized,  all-consuming disappointment with life. That is, human life and its  limitations. I'll never soar through the skies like a bird. I'll never  explore the ocean floor, or uncover any fantastic secrets in places  forsaken by man and by time. I'll never get to bang that hot chick in  that video game. I'll never create great wonders from nothing. I'll  never end all crime, injustice, hatred and inequality in the world. I'll  never wage an epic battle against a pantheon of gods or challenge the  Devil to a battle of guile and wit. I'll never get to explore the  universe and bear witness to any of the boundless wonders of Creation.  So many fictional universes OTHERS have created that I will never get to  be a part of. So many things I yearn for or have conceived of will stay  forever locked in my brain. Like every other human being to ever walk  the earth, I will wither and die and return to nothingness, and the  wonders of my boundless imagination will die with me.

I  will always be a slave to something, somehow. A boss, money, family,  peoples' perceptions of me, an addiction, laws and governments, even my  own body and its wants and needs... I hate it. What I want, more than  anything, is freedom. And not this ghetto-ass, off-brand, bargain-bin  mockery of freedom first-world countries were founded on, which is  slowly being stomped out by governments enslaved by fear and special  interests anyway. I mean TRUE freedom. To me, this means having the  ability to do and experience anything you can possibly imagine. Which,  as I see it, is only possible in one of two ways. The first is death. No  imagination. No bonds. Just nothing. You can do and experience  everything you can imagine. In this case, that just happens to be  nothing. You are a slave to no one, even if you don't have a brain to  process that. The second is acheiving omnipotence. But that's a pipe  dream. And yet my brain still envisions how wonderful that could be.  What a fucking cock-tease. It doesn't stop there though. My  disappointment taints everything in my life. Whatever bones life throws  my way, they pale in comparison to the splendors my mind can conjure for  me. Come into some money? Whatever. Someone bothers to give me a nice  surprise? Whatever. Friends and family taking the time to talk to me  despite my own lack of interest? Whatever.

Despite  all this colorful brain activity, I'm still just a 27-year-old cashier,  forced to act subservient to people I hold in the highest contempt. I'm  miserable, and I make no secret of it, especially when faced with an  annoying customer. I'm an asshole serving assholes. A loser serving  losers, which makes me the biggest loser of all. I go home every night  to a shitty one-room apartment, a cat whom I adore, and a mentally ill  drug-addict girlfriend with whom I have nothing in common. I don't even  know what I feel for her. She's a good person beneath all the bullshit. I  want to see her cast off her shackles, be happy and flourish, but after  7 years and a slew of disappointments I've fallen into compassion  fatigue, maybe even emotional burnout. She was the first woman to  express interest in me in years, so I stuck to her like glue and never  let go, no matter what. As I got to know her I saw she was damaged, but I  thought a little elbow grease and good company would fix her right up,  and I was more than willing to put in the effort. Anything for the  person who made me feel like less of a failure as a human being, I  guess... And yet, despite everything I just said... I still want to be  with her. I want to save her, to help her save herself. I want us both  to reach the light at the end of the sewage pipe and see what lies  beyond, so we can be happy together. What is this? Is this actual love?  Or commitment? Or a sense of obligation/duty? Or purpose? Or maybe it's  just irrational attachment with a side of savior complex? I have no  clue. That's another of my oddities. I've never felt loved. People say  ""I love you"" and I don't really understand the feeling. It strikes me as  a platitude that those close to you say. Whenever someone says it to  me, it almost feels awkward when I feel forced to say it back. I mean, I  know it means that you'll always be there to help the person you love  and there's an implicit trust but... that's kind of it. I'm genuinely  not sure whether I've ever felt genuine love, within myself or others.  My parents, girlfriend, and even my best friend have said it to me  repeatedly, and it never gave me the warm fuzzies. It never made me feel  safer. Or appreciated. Or supported. It's just another thing people  say. I'm a man. I'm conditioned by the world to be self-reliant. I'm  supposed to ""be there"" for everyone, not be the one who needs someone  ""there"" for him. I'm supposed the be the  problem-SOLVER. NEVER the problem. I'm not sure if I don't ""get"" love  because I've firmly drilled this notion into my subconscious or if it's  just a personal barrier or something. Both my parents are quite  well-off. I could ask them for anything. But I never do, and I likely  never will, even though I could sure use it sometimes. It drives me  crazy to see my girlfriend asking EVERYONE she knows for help when  things get rough instead of fixing the problems herself. How can anyone  have any self-respect after imposing themselves on everyone like that?  How can one sleep at night being such a burden on others? Why does  everyone keep helping her? She can keep being irresponsible forever as  long as someone bails her out. I'm a little bit jealous... I'm always  the load bearer, never the load. I wish I could be the load sometimes,  but I could never let myself live it down. And oddly enough, I'm not  hamming this up! I'm not playing the victim here! It is my genuine  position that not asking for help until all other options are used up is  the proper, moral thing to do!

Amidst  all the frustration of my everyday life, how do I cope? How do I stop  myself from going completely insane? Enter video games. They are my  distraction, pastime and poison of choice. A sliver of the freedom I so  crave. Worlds I can interact with in which I can be anything. And do  anything (within the mechanics of the game, of course). My one release  from the disappointment that is my empty, fleeting life. And so we enter  the vicious cycle of addiction: life is shit, get your fix, life  remains shit because you're too busy distracting yourself to fix your  damn problems. Due to an impactful event when I was young, I can't bring  myself to learn to drive a car. It scares me. That being the case, I'm  quite limited in my job prospects since I can't reliably get to a  workplace far from where I live. Being a dropout doesn't help either.  I've always despised school. I have no idea what I want in life because  nothing seems good enough, or worth suffering through YEARS of tedious,  fractally-padded study for. And through all this I'd have to keep  working at this mentally draining job so I can put food on the table and  pay bills, and deal with my mentally draining partner. I feel trapped.  Crushed, even. Video games are my escape. I can get lost in a world  where I control all, if only for a moment. I see these stories  everywhere of addicts hitting rock bottom and then bouncing back up and  making drastic, sweeping changes to their lives. Others hit the bottom  and die there. At this point, I've stopped denying that I'm falling down  the hole and convincing myself that I'm happy when I've been suffering  in silence for years. But at least both outcomes upon hitting the bottom  are desirable to me, I guess. Death sounds peaceful. If I weren't a  damn coward and a slave to self-preservation and to my relationships I'd  probably have ended it all years ago. I'm also open to the possibility  of life getting less shitty if I could step away from the damn computer,  acknowledge all my problems, rip off the bandaids and get to work, but  goddamn. Death just sounds so much simpler. At this point I'm dazed,  tired and rambling. Writing this is my first step towards recognizing  the hurdles ahead of me.

If  anyone saw this wall of text through to the end, have a cookie. I wrote  this exclusively for myself at the beginning, barfing out my every  negative thought onto my keyboard. But now I've done some cleanup, and  wish to speak my piece in the mental health dialogue. Sharing it feels  nice. I hope some of you find commonality in my particular brand of  suffering, that you may realize that you are not alone."
840,I need somone to talk to,im still getting over a breakup with my ex but its been like 5 months and i still haven't recovered sometimes i feel like im over it and i feel better and some times i feel like im really sad and i miss him i have a current boyfriend and he knows about him
841,Just a rant,I'm rly tired. I keep getting anrgy at everything. I'm so stressed and paranoid I'm grinding my teeth all hours of the day. I'm constantly overwhelmed by everything and I've got these rly bad headaches. Everything is just wearing me down. I think I have schizophrenia but I don't want to think about that. It runs heavily in the family. I'm at the age of when it develops and I have enough of the symptoms to get diagnosed. I have minor hallucinations but they're getting worse. And so is the paranoia. I don't feel like I'm even a thing anymore. I'm at one of my better times in the cycle before I start going off the edge again. I'm scared I won't come back the same every time this happens. I'm losing myself. Nothing defines me anymore. I recently have been having alot of repressed memories pop up again from my very bad childhood. I don't want to talk about them. It sucks that I can barely remember anything anymore. I keep getting in trouble with my family for forgetting very important things. My brother has been nothing but cruel to me lately. Can't say that's not partly my fault for being the way I am. I don't have anyone to talk to. I've tried all my school resources and my family but I get shut down every time. It's like they don't want me to be treated. This is just what it's like to be a guy in America. My own school psychologist told me I was a burden to my friends for being suicidal and reaching out for help. I'm not even making that up in the slightest. I just want help but I can't get any so I'll just post this here and hope people don't hate me for it. I feel stupid for posting this.
842,Talking isn't going to help,"I am fairly sure I'm a danger to myself, and that I'll delete this post soon. It's all just been too much. I think about talking to someone, reaching out like I am now, but I know, after this long, it won't help. I've talked about it so many times. Last time I still thought talking might help, I got some guy trying to convince me I'm a narcissist with a victim complex. My therapist thinks it's ridiculous and I score really low on narcissism screening tests and all. But the point is that talking doesn't help. I've been depressed most of my life and I'm tired of hearing it gets better and that I'm not as trapped as I am. I really am that trapped though. It really is that over. It really won't get better. Talking won't help. It never has. I'm not fixable. I've thought about it before, but this time it's different. Because I know talking won't help and that it won't get better. I guess on some level I still don't want to die. Mostly due to guilt. But I think it is going to happen this time. I don't know when, but I don't think I'm going to get away this time. There's nothing to be done for it, not anymore."
843,Significant others mental health,I’m not good at consoling others. I know how it feels to be suicidal. What are some things I can say other than “it will get better” to help with my partners suicidal tendencies? Or what are some things someone has said to you that has helped you?
844,How do I deal with past trauma and avoid the one who abused me,"I'm currently 16 (i'm a female and about to be 17 in June), I've had past trauma with sexual abuse when I was 12 going up to 15 (around maybe 2016), I was molested by my uncle who has touched me on almost all my areas like my crotch and chest. I had perform sex acts to ""pleasure"" him. Finally in 2018 I told my parents about it, of course they weren't pleased about it but I wasn't too sure if he got confronted. My parents weren't really sympathetic when it happened but his wife was (she is the most sweetest aunt I have ever met in my life and I love her with all my heart). Now that it's 2020 I still go to their house because him and my dad are super close and like to play FIFA. Sometimes I really don't wanna go because this shit messed with my head and I also haven't had therapy due to it. I just wanna know if theirs anything I could do to avoid going to their house.

Also my parents are Mexican so I guess you can have an idea of how they feel about mental health...

I'm tired of having panic attacks and feeling suicidal because of this. Someone please give me some advice.

Thank You"
845,Hiding with my depression and PTSD,"I still have bad days and it hurts. I deal with my depression alone. I can't go to my family, my friends already have their own issues to deal with and because of my depression I distance myself from them without even really realizing it. I feel it late at night, when I can finally relax and I'm reminded that I'm not as good as I appear. I'm so scarred to show weakness, I understand that I have PTSD and it's going to affect me but I just can't show it. I don't really let myself have bad days and it hurts. God does it hurt, I don't even want to hurt myself I just want to stop hiding."
846,my life is just a disappointing movie.,"let me explain

throughout my life, nothing had seemed to go right. im like the character that you yell at to not go through that door, because it’s obviously a trap, but still goes through it. no one understands my character. my character is the one that goes unnoticed and abandoned. the main character, but no ones favorite. she’s just there. i don’t know how else to explain it. I feel above my body. i feel beyond, but looking back. looking back at this disappointing movie, waiting for it to end, waiting for the next thing to go wrong. does anyone else feel this way?
sorry if it was hard to understand."

848,"I want to seek professional help, but I don't know where to start.","Hi, I'm 26 years old, female, and Asian-American.

After some personal events happening this week, I finally realized that I want to seek professional help for my mental health, but I don't know where to start. 

I'm known to be extremely sensitive; I can probably define myself as an ""empath"". I tend to people please. I also grow anxious very easily and have some of the physical effects from anxiety (rapid heart rate, insomnia, headaches, chest pains). At times, I tend to self-harm myself and have some suicidal ideation, but I'm doing the best I can to control it. 

I used to go to counseling in my university at the age of 19 after a suicide attempt. I attended for 8 weeks. I thought I was okay after that, but you know, the ""illness"" remains. The anxiety starts to fluctuate for the next 6 years, but I thought I could cope with it. 

At the age of 24, I moved to Northern California to pursue my master's degree, and that's when my mental health took a huge toll on me. I started to exhibit a ""flight"" response in places I don't want to be. I started isolating myself away from friends. My suicidal ideation increased. I sought counseling back in January 2019, but then again, I thought I was better, so we stopped sessions when Spring Semester is over. 

Fast forward to now, with the pandemics and the riots. My mental health got worse. Everything in social media triggers me. My friends are telling me to ""stop feeling everything and get over it"". A few days ago, my boyfriend and I had an argument where we yelled at each other. I tend to do this thing where I walk away to ""cool my mind off,"" and inflict self-harm. My boyfriend told me he's been seeing a cycle in my behaviors. While he admits that he's at fault too, I realized that I am in dire need of professional help. 

My friends have been calling out on my behaviors as well, saying that I'm too ""sensitive"" in other people's emotions other than myself and I ""people please"" way too much. 

If you went this far, then I thank you. At first, I wanna know what my diagnosis is, so I can find a better strategy to take care of my mental health better, but I read stories where some therapists struggle to give a diagnosis. So, all in all, I just wanna break these habits, get better, and be happier overall. 

tl;dr -- Some empath-anxious Asian girl who people pleases and self-isolates herself after feeling triggers want therapy but doesn't know where to start."
849,Im worried about my brother. Please help!!,"My 22 year old brother takes citalophram. He deals with heavy anxiety and depression. So Lastnight we smoked some weed. Keep in mind, we’ve smoked together a good amount of times. He’s still fairly new but has had experience beforehand and also mentioned it helps cope with his anxiety and depression. Anyways, He asked me about 3 times earlier that day (yesterday) so I finally had time and we smoked. Everything felt normal aside from being high, so maybe an hour passes by and I go in his bedroom. When I come in the room He is on his gaming pc with his headphones on watching the kind of videos my 6 yo daughter would usually be watching on YouTube, which I thought was odd only cause she wasn’t hanging out with him. So I tried getting his attention and he ignored me. But he turned his face at me slowly and cracked a smile and turned back. I never feel uncomfortable around him. But that felt weird.
So the next day (which was today) my mom said my brother was acting funny. He wasn’t responding back to her. So my cousin showed up to the house before I was able to and he even said my brother wasn’t making any sense at all. So I finally came and talked with him and my mother in the back porch. We just talked about life. But he has had the strangest behavior. He’s out of character. He’s super chill than his usual tense, fidgety and anxious-self. Which I liked for him but his mental state is not there. He’s saying some outlandish things. He said my daughter thinks he’s a schizophrenic. She doesn’t even know what that is or means. He also said that he thinks she played the videos to get him to think like a kid. Also that he feels like he’s my daughter. And goes on later to say he feels like Me. I left to the bathroom, then he says to my girlfriend “what’s going on? So my brothers dead?” But we don’t have a deceased brother. When I came back out he mentioned how he always envied me but I replied “it’s okay bro I know it’s just brotherly love, not that enemy kind of envy”.. 

There’s so much more he’s said that doesn’t add up but I’m reaching out because I need some urgent answer. He’s with my mom and aunt currently at her place. He’s just scaring me with how his thought process has been the past 3-4 days. I didn’t notice the strange behavior til lastnight. I just thought he was stoned But others have said he was acting strange days prior. 
If anyone can help or has any suggestions on what we should do, please let me know ASAP. I’m very worried. I also have struggled with depression but I’ve never taken any medication for it in my life. I really don’t know what to do 💔"
850,How to Seek a Therapist,"Hey yall, so I'm 18 and am going into my senior year of highschool which means I live with my parents. I'm pretty decent at coping with some of the issues I may have (body dismorphia, depression, major self esteem issues etc, no official diagnoses though) but I'm tired of coping. I refuse to talk to my traditional parents about it because I'll get the typical traditional answer. I'm thinking about seeking a therapists help but an unsure of how to bring the topic up to them and where to look. Any help would be nice!"

In the past , I've also tended to feel happy when I made people feel bad about themselves. I am fully aware that these thoughts are not normal but I cannot stop thinking like this from time to time or feeling somewhat joy from hurting others emotionally."

853,Need advice before going to a GP.,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Hi everyone! Today after 5 years of ‘managing’ and ‘getting by’ I finally decided to actually go to a GP and get help. Last night I was really depressed and wanted to go to the ER but felt too guilty to show up there and say what? That I’m sad?

Anyway, I haven’t booked a visit yet. It’s going to be another hour before they open and I can phone in hopefully to get an appointment. I’m going to have to get an emergency appointment since I’m not even registered with a practice (I’ve tried but they take a minimum of 3 weeks to book an assessment/interview? Before which you can only get in for emergency) there is something about those 3 weeks that made me not register two years ago and postpone getting until now. It feels like it’s the only way I can get my foot in there before thinking myself out of it.
I hesitate because making mental problems official would close a lot of doors - yet those are no good to me anyway until I get help..(Wanted to get a HGV license but going to have to forget about that probably)

Anyway, as you know - the GP is a busy person and only has about 15 minutes to see me. And I’m getting sidetracked.

TL;DR: prequel. Keep scrolling

Dear Reddit! When your mental health gets to a point, where after years of shoving it under the carpet and not being honest with yourself and admitting you need help It affects every aspect of your life. Basically my problem is like a big bowl of spaghetti pasta. Its all mixed together. I don’t know which strand to pull to see whats on the other end of it. And I’m scared that I’ll go to the GP and give him the wrong impression of whats actually going on? 

TL;DR  sequel (oh sweet tangents)

Basically I’m scared shitless of being like misdiagnosed? Or not taken seriously? Yes thats basically my question I have to you guys. And look at all those paragraphs, I hope this indirectly gets my point across. That dude only has 15 mins what do i do??? I might go on a tangent and make it seem like I’m depressed because of something small and get told to meditate and that would be that(Done that in counselling, years back, never came back). I could make a list but whats significant? Whats not?"
854,i don’t know what to do anymore,"
i know most people won’t end up reading this but i feel like this is the place to post this. i have been so broken as of late. recently my mental health has been the worst it has been in years and i’m focusing on fixing that. social media is toxic and i’ve pushed everyone away that has been in my life. but i need to get this off my chest. i wake up daily struggling to even roll out of bed because each day is worse than the last. i don’t know what to do to help me when everyone says “get over it” “you’ll be fine” etc. i’m not fine and it hurts. i just feel like i need to vent this. i just feel like there is nothing left for me. i wanna go do something with my life but i can’t and it’s not even because of the pandemic, even if that wasn’t a thing how in the world would i get to do anything or go anywhere without serious debt and ruin the rest of my life. i feel like there is so much out there but i’m stuck doing something killing me so i can afford housing. i feel like my life has hit its roadblock and there’s nothing to it except repeat the same shit until i die. 

i’m 19 and i suffer from anxiety, depression, and BPD. i don’t take medication and i don’t drink because in the past that has always made it worse. i don’t know what to do to help myself, doctors have been useless, therapy has been a scam and i have no one left to fall to. i’ve failed everyone in my life and ruined everything good. i can’t sleep at night and i rarely ever feel happy. why can’t things be okay. even for just one day"
855,"Sometimes I want to be physicay sick or injured, just so my family will take me seriously.","I've felt with mental health issues for a long time. Often times my family doesnt take me seriously when I'm having a bad mental health day.

 For example when I'm very depressed I'll often say ""I'm having bad day, can we talk about or do ___ some other time?"" 

My family usually responds with ""well you ALWAYS are having a bad day. You know I feel like crap too and I have to put up with YOUR bullshit!""

The other day, I sprained my ankle it for once it seemed like my family actually cared. They let me rest without making me feel guilty, they helped me out with chores etc.  I just wish they rook my mental health as seriously. I dont want to be coddling or not do anything, but samedays I can barely get out of bed."
856,can someone explain wth is going on with me,"i get irritated very easily. like one moment ill be fine and then the next my mom says something that i feel is meant to attack me and ill get very defensive and irritated or i feel like my younger sisters copy everything i do (most of the times it’s petty things) and idk why but it makes me extremely angry to the point where I’ll sometimes cry. most of my anger is caused by my mom tho. i just feel like she never listens to me and she can be the only one that’s ALWAYS right or she can be the only that yells but when i raise my voice she tells me to shut up. she’s always telling me to shut up (or she’ll just say sarcastic remarks like “yeah yeah” “you’re totally right”) even when i DO have a point. you just can’t tell her she’s wrong. but the reason why i feel so shit is because sometimes i have really bad thoughts. for example, when my mom is yelling at me ill make up scenarios/imagine of me bashing her head in or hitting her really hard and other violent stuff. i don’t think I’d ever really act upon those thoughts since i know they’re wrong and i feel bad but i just get really strong urges sometimes. it makes me feel terrible afterwards. i know none of this didn’t make any sense and im not really good at explaining i just thought id get this off my chest"
857,Mental on going issue wanna see if anyone can relate/ help,So for the past couple years I’ve been having an on going conflict in my head where 50% of me wants to be nice but the other 50% wants to be a dick and only keep to myself not caring about others at all. There’s times where I’ll do nice things for other for a day then go home and just think to my self “why did I do that” and start getting angry and upset about it. Then there’s times where I’ll be a dick and not do something to help someone and I’ll sit and think why didn’t I do that that’s messed up. And I just can’t pick either being a good person or just being an ass hole I’m really on a thin line. I just know nice guys always finish last and I’ve been hurt and kicked in the ass by life from being a nice person that I feel better being a dick and a ass hole. If anyone can help in any way just pls lmk.
858,Does anyone have any ideas on how to deal with stress?,Not sure if this is the right sub or not but anyone got idea on how to deal with stress from work and family?

859,These antibiotics have messed up mental health.,"These antibiotics have messed up my mental state.

I’m a young female who took a short course of antibiotics given to me by a clinic for my UTI (not from a pharmacy). I finished my course 2 days ago. I don’t know if it was a really strong or bad batch, but I’ve had issues with memory/brain fog/low emotions with not experiencing any sadness. Thankfully, I can feel some happiness, excitement, and laughter, but not fully like before. I also have been having horrible vivid dreams since taking the antibiotics, even though I’ve stopped now. 

I can’t conjure up emotions associated with certain places, people, or memories. This has never happened to me before and came so easy to me right before the antibiotics. Now I can’t feel anything at all and I’ve almost forgotten them. It’s making me really upset. I’ve been trying to take probiotics to fix my gut and thus mental state, and [now I’m reading that those are bad for you too?!](https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/probiotic-use-is-a-link-between-brain-fogginess-and-severe-bloating-307256). I really wish doctors were more forthright about the necessity of taking antibiotics and possible harmful side effects. 

I don’t know what sources to believe anymore. Will this depression/flat affect go away? What can I do to restore it? And are probiotics good or bad for you? Thanks for any insight."
860,My mental state,"So a few months ago on a different account (forgot the password) I posted about my social anxiety and depression in the past. Months later I still deal with social anxiety , but it’s kind of unnoticeable because of quarantine. What I’m really struggling with right now is depression. I have no motivation to do fucking anything. The hardest thing in the world to me right now, is getting out of bed. Every single day, I wake up, get dressed, hop on YouTube and watch dumb videos for hours and hours and hours and hours and then go to bed at like 5pm. That is what I do everyday because I am fucking like, I can’t even describe it. I feel dumb, I feel bored, I feel sick of everything. The simplest of tasks take hours to do because I have no drive, no motivation to do anything. And it really doesn’t help that I have no idea what I wanna be when I grow up. That’s why I fucking hate school. Because I have to work my ass off, for potentially nothing. Because I don’t know whether I’m just wasting time or not when I could be doing something else. Having a shower, is like running a marathon. Walking to the fridge to get water seems impossible. Everything sucks. I’m in a slump, and I don’t know how to get out of it. My mom says she doesn’t want to go down the route of medication, but it literally feels like the ONLY THING left. I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried counselling, I’ve tried physiologists. None of it did anything. I’m a mess."
861,These antibiotics have messed up my mental health.,"I’m a young female who took a short course of antibiotics given to me by a clinic for my UTI (not from a pharmacy). I finished my course 2 days ago. I don’t know if it was a really strong or bad batch, but I’ve had issues with memory/brain fog/low emotions with not experiencing any sadness. Thankfully, I can feel happiness, excitement, and laughter, but not fully like before. I also have been having horrible vivid dreams since taking the antibiotics, even though I’ve stopped now. 

I can’t conjure up emotions associated with certain places, people, or memories. This has never happened to me before and came so easy to me right before the antibiotics. Now I can’t feel anything at all and I’ve almost forgotten them. It’s making me really upset. I’ve been trying to take probiotics to fix my gut and thus mental state, and [now I’m reading that those are bad for you too?!](https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/probiotic-use-is-a-link-between-brain-fogginess-and-severe-bloating-307256). I really wish doctors were more forthright about the necessity of taking antibiotics and possible harmful side effects. 

I don’t know what sources to believe anymore. Will this depression/flat affect go away? What can I do to restore it? And are probiotics good or bad for you? Thanks for any insight."
862,Im confused.,"Hey so after finding nothing from my typical ""google your symptoms to figure out youre gonna die"" thing, i made a reddit account and came here.

So, as of late ive been like, lying to myself.

About everything.

Like ""hey you forgot your homework"" turns into me closing my eyes and lying to myself saying things like ""you did turn in your homework remember? Yeah."" Or ""what is that smell"" turns into ""you dont smell anything that was your imagination""

Should i be concerned? Im not really sure on what to do or if i should just ignore it

If im overreacting tell me and ill just remove the post lololol"
863,What am I seeing at night? Am I hallucinating?,"I have anxiety and I can have trouble sleeping. I have this thing where I sit up, bolt upright really fast and my heart is going crazy. 

Now the thing is, since I was about 17, (25 now), I've seen a weird black mass when this happens. It looks like loads of black wires all moving together like static. When it first happened I thought it was a spider, and I jumped out of bed, turned on the light and it was gone. Once I wake up properly, I know it's not a spider, because it's way too big, and it's just a black swirling mass. 

This used to be the only thing I saw, but the other night I saw something new. It had a round circle at the top, then a long thin body. It was half black, half red and looked like a amoeba type thing. It was quite large and was wiggling near my door. It disappeared slowly, and i haven't seen it since. 

Has anyone else experienced this type of thing? I never see it during the day, just when I randomly wake up in the night. 

Am I hallucinating because of my anxiety or something else?"
864,Is there a reason to why no one acted on my Suicide attempt?,"I was so young, 11 years old, some of my friends has been sent to hospitals, gotten therapy, their parents bringing them places, is there a reason to why my parents didn’t react?"

866,"Here is the transcripts of my panic attack you didn’t ask for, you know just in case","You feel like the world is ending, but its actually just on fire, wait no, it’s on fire and it’s spinning so so fast . You start to breath in a way you have never breathed. Like you just ran a mile under 4 minutes. Then you feel cold, but you just happened to wipe the sweat off your forehead. You just did it again right this second. Then you go for a glass of water but it takes an eternity for the glass to reach your lips because your hand is shaking uncontrollably. In effort to stop your shaky hand you grab it with the other, but it’s useless. You feel a tight rubber band has been placed on your head, cutting the blood circulation in your brain. Are you really going to throw up? Yes. Your mom just came in the room asking who knows what about grandma but you can’t articulate what she is saying, let alone any response. Just nod, yes just nod and she will go away. Yes!, it worked. Please don’t come back please. Don’t ask me what’s wrong you won’t understand. Please mom I don’t what you to see me like this. I don’t even want to see ME like this. Lock the door now. I don’t want to be bothered. My anxiety can’t take any interruption now because that only makes me more anxious. Just turn on the tv and sit down and it will all go away. Okay sit, sit. No you can’t because pacing back in forth seems like the perfect position right now. Pace, pace. Really are you going to throw up again? Yes. Okay now repeat everything again and again and again ....."
867,Took my wife to the hospital for mental breakdown today.,"I'm posting this because if anyone out there has been through a similar situation, I need to know about it so badly. I can't sleep.

My wife over the past three days hasn't slept. I won't go too far into the details but after three very emotionally exhausting days of questioning if she was going to leave me I realized she needed medical attention. I drove her to a hospital.

She is now committed to a psych ward and because of covid-19 I can't visit her. I know she's scared and I know that when she was in the emergency room and I could visit her, anytime I left the room she would ask for me. It didn't matter that she would go through fits of cursing at me and then saying she loved me mixed in with confusing paranoia. She always asked for me. I know she's asking for me now and I can't be there for her.

I'm at her parents house now. I cried so hard on my mother in law's shoulder.

When she was in the emergency room she'd have moments of clarity and tell me she just wanted to go home. And all I wanted to do was take her home. I keep telling people who ask what I need to just keep telling me I did the right thing because I'm still not sure. A nurse told me I did the right thing. Her mom told me I did the right thing. But it's just so hard to believe it. I cry every time someone tells me that and I keep asking the question because I need to know.

I can't stop crying and I can't stop seeing her in my mind's eye. I don't know what to do.

We're married for almost 5 years."
868,Unique ways to ward off depression?,"What are unique ways to stop depression before it gets really bad? Please no generic ""eat well, sleep well"" comments because those are no possible with depression lol. I am already on 7 medications including 2 mood stabilizers but I'm open to medication suggestions."
869,Everybody says the same bullshit whenever I say I wanna kill myself,"""It gets better""
You don't know that. It's literally impossible for you to know that. So far in an almost 22 year life nothing has ever gotten better, and at this point a huge chunk of my problem is just how fucked the world is and that'll never change. 

""You're not alone""
Yeah I am lol


""Suicide is selfish""
Fuck off with this


""Permanent solution to a temporary problem""
Permanent solution to a permanent problem


""It just transfers the pain to everyone else""
Nobody cares about me first of all so this isn't true. But also why am I more deserving of pain than other people? I really wouldn't care if my suicide hurt people, but it won't.



""Think of what you'd miss out on""
All I'd miss out on is more suffering.


""I'm here for you""
No you're not, you don't even know me.


""Suicide won't solve anything""
It will though? I'll be dead, that's the ultimate solution. How can I have problems if I'm dead


""Anything about God, religion or spirituality""
Fuck off


""Get help""
I have. No shit. You really think I've gotten this far without trying? I've been getting professional ""help"" for 6 years, it doesn't do shit"
870,What’s the best way to reverse neuro-plasticity?,I was watching Limitless last night and was wondering what the optimal ways to keep the brain sharp could be.
871,How do normal people think?,"I have fairly bad anxiety, depression and OCD. Thankfully pure O so no compulsions really. But my mind is CONSTANTLY going about everything. I could be sitting outside in the evening reading something but be thinking:

-How many bugs are crawling on me
-What will I do if someone walks up to me and tries to attack me (on my porch..unlikely) 
-Which way will they come from
-I have a hot tea I’ll throw it on them and scream and hope my husband wakes up
-there are definitely bugs on me
-no you checked for bugs when you came out like you always do
-I can feel it in my ear. 
-great... now I’m going to have a bug lodged in my ear and I’m going to have to go to the hospital if I don’t go crazy first. It’s going to be in my brain
-oh awesome probably going to die of coronavirus in the hospital from bug ear. 
-My mom will want to visit me and since she is high risk she’s going to die because of me

And so on forever and ever

It was very easy for me to write this because they are constantly paths that my thoughts take me on. I am very curious to know how normal people think... I know people without mental health issues still worry so I’m just wondering if anyone has any insight into that."
872,I want to visit a psychiatrist to get help but I’m also scared of getting diagnosed,"I’m 18 and I’m heading for college to study nursing but that’s the problem right there itself. During the last 5 years of high school, I‘ve developed depression and life for me has becoming confusing and the way I handle myself is unreasonably irrational and impulsive. I’m becoming more unstable and I’ve been hiding it from my family because the last time I gave away signs, I was monitored by the university counselor and ever since my mom got relayed by the information on how I’ve been mentally doing, she told it to my extended family and all they do is make is worst for me by telling me that “it’s part of life” and that its all in my head and I should get over it because someone else is as less unfortunate as me. 

Ever since then I feel invalid and scared and angry. My family drived me into a corner when I needed their support the most. 

I’m scared that once I get diagnosed, they’ll be disappointed in me and would force me to take a gap year due to the intense academic workload in nursing, or I won’t be accepted by the university’s college of nursing because I have a disorder. 

I want to understand what’s wrong with me. I want help. I want to recover but I’m just so scared of what life would be after I do get diagnosed.

Advice would be greatly appreciated."
873,Slowly losing all motivation,"As the title suggests, for the past year I’ve been slowly losing all desire to do anything, and it’s gotten to the point where I’m having difficulties even getting up in the morning. All motivation for hobbies I’ve lost, I don’t do anything for enjoyment anymore but out of habit now, I’ve abandoned all my dreams because I just can’t help but think “why bother, no matter what I’ll just end up back in this dead end, shithole town with nothing”, idk what to do. I just feel empty now, and I wish I knew why"
874,I wish I wasn't like this.,"Basically, I'm a recluse. I rarely leave the house except for school (haven't gone out in 4 months now because of Covid) and I haven’t hung out with anyone in years. I've gotten used to this kind of lonely life but I was on a movie marathon and then a feeling of emptiness just slammed into me when I was watching the end of Yesterday. Like what was I doing? Withering away like this? I've felt like this before but not on such a grand scale. I'm 19 and drifting aimlessly, and I don't know what to do or how to start being a normal person again. I have major anxiety and I don't know how or where can I start being normal when the only interaction I've had was online or awkward in real life encounters? I have no confidence in my appearance, personality, hobbies or social stuff. I don't even know why I'm writing this, I guess I've just had enough or want someone to know of my struggles. Idk. I'm not even plain enough to attract any guy, and I feel inferior because there's a lot of attractive people at my school who are fairer than me and slimmer. When I was at school I would see my classmates laugh, chase eachother, eat lunch together, etc. And I would just feel so miserable. I tried to reach out sometimes but I just get so anxious and clammy, plus I already solidified my reputation as the quiet girl and no one really wants to get to know me anymore. Sigh."
875,"My father's prejudice, abuse, and bitterness hurt me in my childhood and hindered my personal growth. I intend to overcome this.","I grew up hearing my dad angrily and drunkenly rant, talk about stereotypes and many many racially targeted jokes. Im from a family of Irish people who grew up in the Bronx, NY, and while many of them are liberal and open minded, there are many such as my father who revel in racist jokes and cling to prejudices. I had participated in a Boyscouts troop in which I was 1 of 3 white boys out of twenty-something boys, I was friends with many of these guys and there were many camping trips, hikes, barbecues, birthday parties, fundraisers, and community outreach events we participated in.
When I was around 12, my parents' arguments escalated and my mom would eventually leave, I did not hear from her for a year, during this time, my dad would angrily and drunkenly rant. There were many physical and verbal altercations with my father, he would beat me, drag me out of bed and choke me, and lock me in my room for hours, in a few cases I soiled myself as I was locked inside and he had passed out. He and my mother had convinced me from a young age that ACS would take all my things and that the Child Services agents did things to kids, so when they investigated I was too scared to say anything. I continued with Boyscouts but during one camping trip I had said something racially motivated to another boy, while I had not used any slurs, it was offensive, harmful, and degrading. I was promptly punched for what I'd said and I cried in the dirt while everyone looked down with looks that are still burnt into my brain; disappointment, hurt, judgement, concern. I internalized the shame I felt from that day and quit the scouts, I fell out of touch with friends who I was too ashamed to face, friends who I had known since we were toddlers. Many of my feelings have contributed to my drug abuse, self harm, and suicide attempts. Ive lived since with few friends and pursued my education in the Bronx and Ive committed in my relationship with my girlfriend, who has taught me more in compassion and respect than my parents ever could. In response to my sister and I participating in protest against police brutality, my father told me how ""if (he) had the money, (he'd) move out to Ohio, purchase an AR-15, and blow away anyone a shade darker than (him)"". The old man is wet brained from all his drinking and hacks so much on his swisher sweets I'm sure he won't even remember saying that.

Once i am able, I intend to leave him behind to live out his days in loneliness. I intend to finish my education, set an example that was not set for me, and one day raise kids without the burdens of prejudice and abuse."
876,How to get over competitiveness/anxiety over sharing good things?,"I honestly love helping others.

The problem is, when I share good things (e.g. knowledge or advice) I feel anxious because I'm afraid that others will use it to become better than me. It somehow triggers a competitive urge in me that makes me want to keep good things to myself. I feel bitter that I spent a lot of time discovering something and that others will have this knowledge handed to them easily.

An example is if I find a shortcut at work or a good way of doing something, I share this advice with others. However, after I share this, I fear that they'll do their job better than I can and I will lose my status as a top performer. I work hard at my job and feel jealous that these people will have access to information that I worked hard and spent a lot of time to discover.

Another (super frivolous) example is, today I found a gorgeous nail technician and shared her work on my social media because I genuinely want her business to do well. However after sharing the story, 5+ of my friends followed my nail artist and now I'm worried that if she becomes too popular it'll be hard to make appointments/she will increase her prices.

Is it normal to feel like this or is it just because I'm too competitive/jealous? How do I get over these feelings?"
877,I have all these thoughts of hurting my mom,"I'm not gonna do it but I think about it constantly. She's such a huge part of why I'm so depressed and want to kill myself. She's always been abusive and only valued alcohol and nothing else. She was horrible to me and my half sister as kids and shows no remorse. She physically and mentally abused us as kids and still mentally abuses me now at 22. I hate her. I have no love whatsoever for her and I never will, I wish I never met her.



She's one of the worst people I've ever met. She's only fueled by anger and selfishness and she doesn't care whose life she ruins. She just drinks , yells and hurts people. That's her entire life. 

I have all these fantasies about hurting her and making her feel even a fraction of what she's made me feel."
878,Is it depression?,I try to stay positive with ofetn failing and crying myself asleep. I've lost my appetite. I hate everything for some reason. I have unusual daydreams and struggle to sleep

880,(OCD) Can people hear/feel my intrusive thoughts and mantras? I need understand &amp; help,
881,Help me like I help you for once.,"I always try my best to make everyone feel happy, comfortable, loved. etc. I put myself in others shoes and try connecting my feelings to them. I just want people to know they aren't alone. I always try putting a smile onto my face and make sure I have this hyper personality that will get others through out their days. Yeah, it helps people get through their days but me. Ive always been nice to everyone but the only thing I get back is being bullied, harassed, hit, and so much death and suicide threats. I don't know what I did wrong.

882,Prescribed drugs have revolutionised my outlook on life and wellbeing (Bipolar Disorder),"I'm 19 and suffer from bipolar disorder and manic depression. For most of my life I was prone to extreme bouts of anger and crying fits. On the outside I was a smart student, accepted to a good uni and had heaps of friends. No one suspected the aggression and pent up turmoil deeply rooted within me. My parents and close friends always had an inkling that it was a puberty thing since I started acting more irrationally around the ages of 14-16. At 17, I was suicidal, in my head and I dabbled in heavy drug use my last years of highschool. I began sleeping around a lot under the guise that I was personally taking back ownership of my body but in reality I was severely lonely and craved attention. I experienced week-long spouts of depressive episodes and locked myself in my room for days on end just crying hysterically on the ground. 

Last Christmas, I was driven to aggression because I felt isolated and lonely during the holiday period. I took MDMA and passed out crying to the fucking Beatles. This is around the time when I realised I needed help. I had to stop treating my body this way and begin to nurture it and develop a relationship with myself. I was lost in subjecting myself to pain and suffering because in that deep pit of sadness was where I felt most safe in its familiarity.

Only this year I began seeking proper professional help. My doctor referred me to a psychologist. I have always been extremely wary of medication and pharmacotherapy because in a sense I wore my trauma as a badge. I didn't want to be stripped of my identity or lose my experiences. I was prescribed Seroquel at 25mg but in the first 2 months I abused it heavily with alcohol and mixed it with drugs. Its effects didn't work the same and I was bumped up to 50mg. This was when I felt life was starting to pick up. I didn't have this irrational burning desire to explode and everything felt at peace. My doctor then prescribed me to Lithicarb tablets following advice from my psychologist.

I feel like now I'm at my best. There are days where I feel worn out and tired but at the same time I know when to give my body a break. I have slowed down on recreational drug use, stopped smoking cigarettes daily and began to really implement little things into my daily routine to support my journey. I sleep every night at 10.30pm, began saving my money and have fostered even closer relationships to my friends through their ongoing support and relentless efforts to ground me and communicate their love."

886,"I finally feel good about myself, but... (Anhedonia?)","Three years ago, when I was 14, I went to a school where everyone was older than me (16-18 ish). Being younger than the rest, I was at a different stage, I found other things funny n what not. I instantly felt like I had to change, and burry my own self to be liked by the others... resulting in some really bad sort of social anxiety, and lack of confidence. I went to this school for 2 years, and when I got out of there i started slowly feeling better. 

A year later, I don’t feel anxious being social anymore. But now I  often don’t feel capable of enjoying socializing like I used to, it often feels like a chore to respond to people, making for some boring conversation... If I don’t socialize on the other hand, I feel lonely as fuck. I’m wondering whats going on, because it feels like I’ve finally almost found myself again, I’m not anxious, sad and worried all the time, but I mostly don’t feel excited. Now I feel neither sad nor excited.

The problem is, I lack the ability to enjoy things like I used to. I have very little drive to actively engage in the different things I like to do. I still do them though because giving up feels meaningless and sad, but when I do, it basically feels like my brain doesn’t reward me for experiecing good things. I’ve read into something called anhedonia, which is basically the brains dopamine receptor not doing its job right, this might be what I’m experiecing?. I guess I’m just looking for feedback about what might be going on and maybe how you think I can deal with it?

&amp;#x200B;

My story:

I've never been really the happiest of people, but I tried, I really did.

I was born and live in germany, my first language was russian though. Which basically means when I learned german, I was speaking with a heavy accent. Kids are cruel. Tonguetwisters with a lot of 'R' sounds in them made me tear up. Kindergarden and elementary school were not the worst. elementary school kids made fun of me, which made me completely lose my accent. But I was also wearing glasses, I started wearnign them when I wasnt even 1 year old. My eyesight was always bad, so another factor to make fun of... yay. I coped with directing all of my intention to my best friend at the time. When we got to 5th grade we kind of just drifted off, because we went to different schools. School sucked, I was really bad at it. To all american readers: In germany middle school and highschool are the same thing, we go from grade 5-10(13) at the same school. We have Gymnasium which is the school for highly talented kids. Realschule, which is for the avarage kid and Hauptschule, which is suited for children who have trouble learning. There are a few others, but these are the ones important ot the story. My parents send me to the gymnasium school, sicne htey didn't want to repeat what they screwed up with my brother. My brother grew up in russia with my parents, before they all left for germany. Because his grammar was bad, the elementary school suggested Hauptschule for him. He went and got amazing grades and was at the top of his class. Sadly when you went to that school you diploma is basically not as worthy as the one for example from Gymnasium. Which made life just a tiny bit harder for him, but hemanaged to get into one of the biggest coorporations in germany and works a high paying job without ever having to go to college.

I on the other hand, was never an amazing student. I am dyslexic and hated school. Elementary school suggested Realschule for me, since I was about avarage, bad at grammar but good at most other subjects. But my parents decided to send me to Gymnasium since 'Their kids are clever and they don't want to make the same mistake again.' Spoiler alert! I got literally the worst grades, I was so bad in school and was really struggeling. Especially in 'German' aka. where being dyslexic is the worst. 

I later found out that the teacher hated me and gave me bad grades because of that. I got a private tutor, I showed her my exam (In which I got an F) and she was shocked. She said if I was in her class, she were to give me a C- or if she didnt know me a D, because of my dyslexia, which was very apparent for everyone, but no one ever wanted to diagnose me btw. So I guess its all self diagnosed.

The worse grades I got the worse I became in all other subjects, because I was just incredibly demotivated to do anything anymore.

Problem was, my parents are russian. THey have 'russian temper' when I brought home an E or an F, I had to pay them 5€ (I didn't get pocketmoney btw, I had to do some work to get money). And depending on the subject and the grade, I also got a beating.

I grew distant to my parents, I didn't tell them anything anymore. Not about the harsh mobbing I got or how I felt.

I was also part of our school choir, which was nice. But whenever I invited my parents they either didnt show up or were late. I later told them to never come if they come in late, since I was so upset the missed my only solo, their excuse was 'We had to install our navigation system in the car so we could drive to your aunt tomorrow' - I was furious.

7th Grade wasnt happening in Gymnasium, they kicked me out and send me to Realschule. Which was even worse, teachers hated me. I hated them. Got the worst grades. Got beaten up and grew even more distant. Now at this point I only had animes to keep me company, I've met some online friends through that later. Which where the only reason I could smile. I locked myself up in my room after school, when I was hungry I ran into the kitchen grabbed what I wanted, ran back up and ate in my room. I wasnt allowed to eat there, so basically whenever someone came upstairs I quickly hid my food and waited for them to leave. Problem was I was incredibly forgetful, so my yoghurts sat there modling for weeks, until I was made to clean my room.

Side story: One time my dad made me clean, found a mold covered yoghurt and forced me to eat it, since we shouldnt waiste food. I screamed and cried, he didnt make me eat it, he just punched me, threw the yoghurt on the groudn so I had to clean it up. Better then eating it I guess.

So school was going bad, I never really had real life friends, meeting my online friends wasnt a thing, so I was lonely, probably got depressed and just waited for everythign to end.

I had to repeat my 9th class. Yay more hell. When I was finally done. I had a year of self pity. I applied for exactly 326 Jobs and either got no answer or a no. I had no job, no life. I stayed in my room for an entire year. Only leaving for the bathroom or at night when everyone was asleep to get my food for the whole entire day. I foudn some friends through anime, I started to cosplay a few years before that and my now best friend hooked me up with a job, a few other things happend after that, but thats basically the depressing part?

&amp;#x200B;

Whats going on now?  
I never made up with my parents for their abuse. They basically think they didn't do anything wrong and that what they did was normal. I don't trust anyone in my personal life enough to talk to them about my depression in depth, because I literally don't trust anyone anymore.

I still live at home with my parents and my grandma. My mom takes care of my grandma, I take care of my mom so she doesnt freak out and get angry with her, since she is old and doesnt know that she is doing stuff wrong. My dad works and earns the money. 

I've been diagnosed with a bad migrane when I was younger, among other health complications, I was always sick because stuff happend when I was born that basically created holes in all of my organs. Earlier this year I went under surgery against my endometriosis. Basically means some stuff that makes my menstrual pain literally as bad as the pain when you birth a child... but it happens every month. 

Basically I am not very healthy physically is what I am saying. This quarantene is really starting to get to me. Most days of the week I get up with crusty eyes because I cry myself to sleep. I am depressed, stressed and lost all interest in everything I loved. I hate cosplay. I hate watching anime. I hate being creative. I hate playing videogames. It all makes me sad. I gained some weight and feel ugly in my cosplays. I rage quit every game I play. I am just doing nothing all day. 

What makes matters worse is I have a job where I literally see the worst imagery there is in the world. It doesnt really affect me that much, but I find myself seing suicides and instead of being disgusted and quickly deleting those, I watch them to see if they work. Which is probably not that good.

I don't think I want to kill myself, yet whenever I close my eyes in the past few days I see myself in my car riding into a tree at full speed.

My best friend who lives near me is moving away. I will be alone. I find no happiniess in anything right now. I wouldnt dare to go to therapy, sicne first I don't know how and second my parents would probably get involved in that, and I don't want that. I want them in their bubble of thinking everything is ok, that I am happy and nothing is wrong.

There is seriously a whole lot more of stuff, but this is already too long, and I don't think anyone will read this far.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR - Health problems, mental problems, lost interest in everything and everyone. Only one friend who moved away. Parents rude and no therapy pls.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

My Question: 

Does anyone have an idea what I could do? Anything that would bring back my love for cosplay or people in general, without therapy?

889,I've never told anyone about my eating disorder,"Small context, Michael was a good friend to me since we were only 5. Becky was a girl I have known since similar age but the two only met when we started highschool (around 5 years ago). The two started dating around a year and a half of knowing eachother.

Things are still hazy as I try my hardest to forget. I remember he invited me over after school to hang out, which wasn’t anything special as at that point in time we were still close friends and hung out often. This was when he was in that rocky on and off period with Becky. He told me that once again they had broken up. I tried to console him as much as possible. He then tried to push himself onto me. At first, I would just push him away, move to the side, then move to the whole other side of the couch. When I finally said outright no, he backed off but began acting different. 

The next day, Becky informed me on how her and Michael were back together. I was uncomfortable and decided not to tell her what he did. I brushed it off and stupidly continued being friends with him. He seemed almost mad at me and slowly, little by little would begin to bring up insecurities abut my body he knew I had. He would call me things such as “a fat cow” “ugly bitch” and other things I refuse to repeat ever. He always said them with a joking manner and would tell me it was “just a joke” and to “lighten up” whenever I started to show obvious signs that I was uncomfortable. Michael made me learn to hate my body. He knew what made me upset and insecure from years of friendship and was pointing them out in front of others to deliberately hurt me. 

I became so insecure with myself that I began to starve myself.

I would go sometimes weeks on end only eating one meal a day. Breakfast was easy to skip; I would get out of bed late and then take over an hour to get ready claiming that there wasn’t enough time for me to eat anymore. Mum would sometimes suggest I grab fruit and eat it on the way to school or even at school before the bell rung. I would pretend I did. I skipped breakfast most mornings on the weekends too. A lot of it was the same. I would just wake up late and by the time I was out of bed, it was around lunch time. Lunches were easier to skip on school days. Nobody ever really noticed that I wasn’t eating because they always had their attention on something happening; normally Michael making some sort of scene. I found it ironic that he was the reason I was doing this to myself and he was also the reason that it was so easy half the time. I didn’t really like wasting my food but people like Becky and Michael were always good at stealing my food anyway, so it was never really wasted. Lunches on weekends were a lot harder. Its easy to avoid food when there only a small box of it you have to resist but when there’s an entire room, its another story. I had to spend a lot of this time in my room and would often avoid going near the kitchen for any reason. This was the worst and lunch time was always around the time that my stomach would begin to hurt the most. I often cried because of the amount of pain my stomach felt but I refused to eat because I hated the way I looked more. Dinners were my one meal. Even then I don’t believe I would finish the whole thing a lot of the time. The longer I did this to myself, the less food my stomach could handle eating in one serving so slowly my dinners became smaller. 

Sometimes I would eat more than just my one meal a day, like if we had guests over. Whenever heather stayed, we would go up town for lunch, we would eat tea at mine, we have a big breakfast the next day to make up for staying up so late eating junk food and playing video games. I never purposefully made myself throw up, but I will admit with some shame that my stomach just wouldn’t be able to handle the amount of food we would eat on these days and throw up without trying. I knew how to cover it up whenever it happened and there were people around. 

Th worst part was that after I began starving myself and I did begin to lose weight, people seemed to like me more. More people would seem to talk to me at school. More people payed attention to what I had to say. I suddenly had more people adding me on social media. People began to come up to me and compliment how “amazing” I looked. I didn’t feel amazing. I felt like a slob, I felt like all the word Michael had used to describe me. The more and more people complimented me for being the truly unhealthy self I was being, the more and more I thought it was working and that I could one day also be happy with the way I looked. 

My mental health declined during this time too. I hated everything about myself and started to blame myself for every little thing that went wrong in life. I had many panic attacks and break downs. I didn’t cut myself but would push something blunt against my thigh hard enough to leave a bruise where only myself could see it. 

It took me a little over a year to realize what I was doing to myself. I began to slowly start eating more and more meals. I started going to a councilor to try and get my head in check, that’s when I started taking my stress med tablets. I still haven’t recovered; it’s been nearly 2 years now. I still throw up in the morning if I eat too much for breakfast. I still don’t take food to school with me and only rarely eat lunch. I work later and later nights and so by the time I get home, everyone has eaten tea, so I eat in my room alone. I am never able to eat the whole thing and have to change my bin at night before I go to sleep so I don’t wake up to a to a rotting smell under my desk. I hide my own snacks away in my room to try and encourage myself to eat more and not skip meals. I still look at myself in the mirror with disgust as I hate the thing that stares back at me on most days. Someday are great, however. I feel confident in my own skin. I genuinely smile at school. I understand what is happening around me and I like how I look. 

I’ve never told anyone about what he did to me mentally. I told a small group of girls from our friends’ circle about how he tried to push himself onto me, but nothing further than that. My eating disorder and struggle with it have been my secret to hold."
890,i’m terrified :’)),hi guys. i’ve been doing therapy for 8 years now and it’s not doing anything for me anymore. i have been referred to a psychiatrist and i’m going today - i am scared shitless. it’s really dumb but i’m terrified at the thought. the psychiatrist is also a man and my therapist is a woman so i’ve gotten used to that as well. does anyone have any tips ? a personal story about a similar situation ? anything would help !
891,I’m literally depressed over a dumb tv show. It’s actually affecting my life and I feel so dumb about it.,"Hi, so I (18M) made the mistake of watching 13 Reasons Why for the first time a few days ago. I had to stop at episode 6 because it was affecting me too severely. The whole story is just so tragic and sad and awful that I couldn’t stop thinking about it all day, and to be honest I still can’t stop thinking about how sad it is. I didn’t get triggered by the suicide or anything thankfully, but just the whole story line actually made me depressed. Like I didn’t want to do anything, I was really irritable, I wasn’t interested in things I enjoy. I don’t really feel I can return to real life, when there’s this big tragedy that happened in a fictional world to people that don’t even exist. I want to feel like myself again, but I’m just sad and almost tearful about this stupid show all the time. I don’t know what to do, I wish I’d never watched it. I need help with this I think. I do not recommend this show."
892,How do you get out of bed when you have nothing to get up for?,"No purpose, everything pointless, everything is so confusing to me. I dont know how I feel. I just spend all day in bed crying"
893,Should I bring out to my mother the option of seeing a therapist? Should I insist or am I overreacting?,"Hello,

My family is me, mother, father, grandmother from my father side - we live in a house together - or rather they lived there without me and I returned home for a few months after not being at home for several years. A year ago my grandfather (father side) that lived with them died. He had dementia, meaning that my parents spent a lot of energy taking care of him, and now my grandma seems to have early stages of dementia too, since she seems fading away mentally, taking --a lot-- of energy from my parents. In addition our family dog, which she was very attached too died a few months back.

Our family structured more around female caregivers, so my mother takes most of the burden of going to the doctors, cleaning, handling all the uneasy behavior of an demented person like not acting reasonably etc.

My mother was always snappy, but lately, after moving back I've noticed a sudden change - she is constantly stressed, snappy, and not letting go of her view that she is responsible for --everything-- at home - cleaning, cooking, taking care of grandma in addition to working full-time.

As far as I know everything else is good - she works and works good, she eats (although little, but it was always the case), she doesn't have memory issues or isolation issues, doesn't drink and doesn't have much more headaches than usual. But she tends to take things very personally, offended easily, accusing herself very often. Most behaviors were there before, but since I'm back home it became almost the norm - almost everyday she snaps on my grandma when grandma forgets something important (like fixed-eating times - important to diabetics, or even life threatening, like to wash hands after doctor visit with the whole corona thing). I'm afraid that she is months/weeks away from breakdown, but I'm not a professional, and maybe I'm over-reacting.

**Question**: Is a person that I've described one that should see a therapist (even for just an evaluation), or maybe anyone in this situation would act the same, and I'm just over-reacting? There are cultures where therapy is the norm (like the US) or a huge shame (like India maybe? IDK). We come from a culture that is in-between - therapy is not frowned-upon, but will definitely be weird, so approaching my mother about it can offend her.

**Tl;dr**: Mother lately very snappy due to very stressful environment - grandfather death, family pet death and grandmother with several health issues including probably dementia. Everything else in life is normal. Should I suggest therapy, or is it normal human response?

**P.S.** I know that describing a person and their environment is hard on reddit, so if you have more questions feel free to ask - this is a throwaway account, so I can answer pretty honestly."
894,"An ex-friend has spread lies to my other friends that I killed myself. When it turned out wrong, my friends blocked or ignored me, thinking that I made fun of them. Since then, I'm crying everyday. After what I've learned today my whole body is shaking and I feel like my mind is about to leave me.","Fundamental info in the beginning: I get treated for depression and dissociative disorder, in the past also for ADHD and speech impairment.

My friendships always have been a little awkward. People tend to think that I'm a sarcastic asshole. It has to be something wrong with me, but I can't tell what - I'd consider that I have something like asberger? Though then I wouldn't have these emotions. At work it took a very long time to let people understand that they perceive me my personality completely wrong. Me and my great boss managed to clarify these issues and I'm working on myself to not sent false signals.

These problems make me appreciate my few friendships very much. People don't like me, some even hate me, but I don't have any bad intentions. Finding friends is almost impossible, so I'd never treat the angels I found bad. Because I know that people often perceive me wrong, I regularly tell my friends that I love them or appreciate them otherwise.

It has been half an year ago that someone spread the lie that I killed myself and sent a letter around in the name of my family. At that time I wasn't able to go online and was in a mental state where you could actually believe this information is true. People took this information for valid because of my absence. When I had internet again this information obviously turned out wrong and my friends blocked/ignored me, thinking that I was the one spreading this information to mess around with them. I just learned about this today, when one friend finally replied to me with a reason why she is ignoring me half an year later (this happened while I was talking with my therapist, too and we made an appointment to talk about it).

This is hilarious. Since they've left me, my whole life fell apart. I can't live a day without crying about loosing them, I'm just a dead soul in a living body. I'm extremely depressed and lonely. Now that I learned that I get blamed for this false information, I'm loosing my mind. I don't even get a chance to explain the situation, they don't believe me. Nobody is taking me serious and all the love I spread is considered a joke. I just need somebody staying on my side, please. At this rate I doubt that experts can help me. What are they gonna do? Tell the world that it's just a miss understanding? Fuck this."
895,Sort of repost but I’ll keep it brief :P,"1. Basically, I’ve recently been getting intrusive thoughts expressing concerns about what I’m eating as a result of a mixture of not wanting to be greedy and also because I worry unnecessarily about if what is good for me. I’ll make a list of my daily diet, just because, here:
Breakfast: 1. A banana. A peach and passion fruit yoghurt. A cheese sandwich OR about three slices of toast with strawberry jam.
OR 2. Banana slices mixed with the previously mentioned yoghurt and some granola cereal thing that has little bits of raspberry in it.

Lunch: Usually a turkey and cheese sandwich with tomato and cucumber. If my mum makes it for me she adds olive oil, some salt and oregano but I don’t bother when I do it myself :P

Dinner: either pasta OR chicken or tuna with vegetables and rice.

Snacks in between meals (usually between lunch and dinner): Nuts (cashews and almonds) or an apple, usually. So that’s it, I have a bit more info on the previous post I did about this :P


2. Basically, my maths tutor who I’ve known for two weeks, well, I had a lesson with her yesterday and during it I heard the screenshot sound. I’m pathetic, I know, but I just found it weird and thought I’d share.

Thank you for reading and God bless xxxx"
896,Do I have an eating disorder?,"Hi, I'm really scared that I might have an eating disorder/body dysmorphia. When I look in the mirror I feel like I look way too skinny, even though all my friends and family are saying that I look fine. I have started to go to semi-extreme ways of gaining weight. I binge eat in the night and eat until I feel physically uncomfortable. I weigh myself twice a day. I look at thinspiration to motivate myself to gain weight and stop looking so skinny. I've started counting carbs, protein, calories and sugar to make sure I'm eating more of it. I can't stop looking at the parts of my body that I feel are the worst.  I don't know what this would be called as an eating disorder, because I'm basically doing the exact opposite of anorexia. What can I do? I'm only 13 btw."
897,Is Racism something that needs mental health attention?,"I’m an Indian M/24, throughout my life from a young child through adolescence I can remember everytime someone has said something really horrible about the colour of my skin, and with everything going on in the world, it leads me to think that not only is there a massive rejection to cultural education by Caucasian people and obvious parental teaching but I also believe that the stigma of being openly racist on social media platforms and even to peoples faces, there must be something ingrained into these people’s mind. Shouldn’t you be embarrassed to make someone of different ethnicity feel so terrible about themselves that they can’t look in the mirror. I just want to say that as a person who has seen racism there whole life, if you wanted to hurt someone because of the colour of their skin well you have done for hundreds of years successfully, but now you best fuck off my feed."
898,It's okay to dislike and fight your own autism,"There's a growing trend of neurodiversity in mental health discourse. Basically, specifically about high-functioning autistic people - none of your suffering exist, just accept / love yourself and kaboom.

I've been denied plenty of support and empathy because of that. I was not allowed to voice my frustrations with this disorder, and how much it harms me. For anyone else out there who's sick of being autistic - it's okay, your reality IS real. You're not delusional.

For anyone else who wants to silence us because ""I'm good at math because of my autism so it's wonderful"" - fuck off. This is not about you."
899,Thoughts on self-harm, i been seeing this psychologist for about 6 months he specializes in BPD  . he macks me feel like a person i always am happy when i leave his office . he the reson i have not cut my self in 3 moths .becuse i donot want to disappoint him.  i just want people to know its never to late .
900,wish: seeing the light at the end of a tunnel,"I don’t actually use Reddit but I don’t know where else to share my thoughts to. I am a part of the graduating class of 2020 and, like everyone, thought that I would be able to go to prom, graduate, and enter college normally (given that I’ve applied to universities).

No one expected this downturn though.

The past few months in quarantine had me become closer with my thoughts. I always knew I had anxiety but I’ve never gone to a doctor for it and just found out in a test my school did. I didn’t think it would be a problem, but oh boy was I wrong when quarantine came. I am a bundle of nerves. The dream school I’ve always wanted to go to put me on a waiting list and I had to go through measures to be able to be reconsidered by the said school. I think that’s where my thoughts took a turn. Everyday I feel so restless because there’s a possibility I won’t be getting into a university, let alone my dream school (I was redirected, waitlisted, never qualified).

I began thinking how much of a disappointment I was.

I have an Asian family and of course, you know how that is. They’ve never been really vocal about it though but education is still education and it’s important. When my dream school put me on a waiting list, they were even happy to help. But that just dampened my mood even more. I felt like a disappointment. Every time I look at my father, all I feel is guilt — guilt on how I didn’t pass, how I asked help, everything really. And it kills me. I ask myself “how dumb can you get?”. As I mentioned before, they’ve never been really vocal but I knew I had standards to live up to. And having the results come back from the college entrance tests just put me in a bad place because I feel like I wasn’t enough — not enough for college, for family, and it’s honestly weighing me down so much. Maybe I should’ve tried harder. But that’s the thing, right? I’ve tried the hardest and it still wasn’t enough. As my 18th birthday nears, that’s the only wish I want to receive — to be able to get into a university. 

Everything hurts.

I want the reassurance that it’ll be okay. But it’s not gonna help my restless soul because it might NOT be okay. Maybe it never will be.

I don’t know where I’m going with this. I just know I’ve had enough of all these thoughts and I just want to see the light at the end of a dark tunnel."
901,Divorce/homesick/depressed,"So my divorce is almost final and I'm ok with that, I've just been upset because I moved from where I lived for over twenty years to live with my wife. We were married for 4 years and then she wanted a divorce, we were already going through things so I agreed. We have a 2 year old and I don't want to leave where I currently live because I want to see him as much as I can, we both keep him 3 days a week. My grief is that I now live in this area where my wife grew up that I don't like but I don't want to leave here because I get to see my son every week. I've been strongly thinking about moving back to where I grew up but I feel like I would be abandoning my son if I move back, I really miss my family and I don't feel like I have support where I currently am living."
902,"This may probably sound stupid, but it kinda troubles me when I think about it.","Now I know this may sound really dumb (believe me I think so too) but this thing has been concerning me.

So the gist of it is that I have this stuffed animal (which I named Jackie) that I absolutely adored as a child. I've had it for as long as I can remember.

Anyways, Jackie was my favorite stuffed animal and I always played with it, I'd cuddle with it when I slept, and my mom always says that I couldn't sleep without it. Now, I know that's pretty normal for a kid - having a favorite toy and all - but what concerns me is that it continues up until now. I'd talk to it as if it were an actual person. I'd given its own voice and personality and I'd even have pep talks and conversations with it. My mother would always reprimand me saying that it was weird and that I should just stop doing it because it was unfit for my age.

This may sound like a dumb thing to be worried over and it could just be me overreacting, but it does trouble me quite often. Does anyone know how to deal with this kind of thing?"
903,How can I be helpful to my sister who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia?,"My sister (29 years old) was a self-admit into the hospital in August 2018 and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was put on risperdal, however she claimed it did not help her and she came off of them December 2018. That same month, she was traveling on a bus and she had an episode. From my understanding, she was disoriented and was acting in a disturbing manner that a local called the cops on her. She was back in the hospital and court ordered to take risperdal. She was released from the hospital February 2019 and has been doing outpatient treatment (group therapy, individual talk therapy and continued taking meds).

Fast forward to today, she appears to be doing well with self-care. However, she just texted me that she wants to come off her meds. She confided in me that, three years ago Stephen Hawking was stalking her and that he had hired people to track her down to read her thoughts. Since taking the meds as prescribed, the stalking has stopped. Which you would think she could see the correlation between taking meds and curbing the delusions but she does not. She read one of Susannah Cahalan books and feels that doctors misdiagnose patients. 

She told me she mentioned all this to her therapist. She said that the therapist said meds are voluntary. 

I want to respect her autonomy and be supportive but I feel like the meds help her. I want her to feel valued but I don't know how to do that when I want to tell her to take her meds. I feel like I can't do anything, say anything. Am I supposed to just step back and just watch from the sidelines? I am not her health care proxy, so I don't have a say anyways.  

tl;dr: Sister is diagnosed with schizophrenia and doing well on meds for over a year. She wants to come off of the meds. How can I be helpful to her while respecting her autonomy?"
904,Supporting Loved Ones Who Have Been Through Trauma (A Guide),[removed]
905,"I swear by my heart that I am neurodivergent in some sort of way - I examine my behaviors and thoughts, and they line up with symptoms of ADHD and possibly even autism. But everyone I talk to says they think I'm completely normal. How do I know if something is actually wrong with me?","This is a very messy list, but I'll try to list down everything that makes me feel like I may have some sort of disorder.  

* I've always felt ""disconnected"" from my peers. Not in a ""lonely kid"" kind of way - more of in a sense that I literally could not relate to the social habits and interactions of my peers. A lot of their humor and jokes don't resonate with me, and my attempts at being like them tend to look awkward instead. This has been going on all my life.  
* Severe lack of motivation unless I have a deadline coming up - and even then I sometimes don't have the motivation to do it. I have an unnecessarily hard time just sitting down and getting things done. I find every reason possible not to do it, whether it is a good reason or not. I know a lot of people these days are unmotivated, so it made me thing that maybe this is normal. But this has been going on my whole life, and never improved when I thought it would. 
* I live in my head a lot. I love listening to music and creating fantasy worlds in my head. This also happens during times when it shouldn't like when I am talking to someone or during class, which creates issues with me focusing on the task at hand. 
* I get frustrated very easily, and by that I mean that when I hang out with friends, they eventually start to annoy me even though they didn't do anything wrong - I just get... ""tired"" of them after a while. 
* I like to ""jump around"" when I am by myself listening to music to release bursts of energy. I don't have this same energy when I am working or exercising, for some reason. 

There are other symptoms that I can't explain off the top of my head right now, but these are the main ones.  

Along with the fact that friends, family, and therapists (recent ones and childhood ones, too) say that they think I am a normal kid, I'm also worried that I am simply trying to label myself when nothing is actually wrong. But I know my own mind and I know my own behaviors, and maybe my sense of ""normal"" is skewed, but I know it is not good because it creates problems for me in my life.    

I think the biggest reason why I want to know for a fact that I am neurodivergent is so that if I know my diagnosis for a fact, it will be easier for me to know how to help myself, what to tell my therapist, and generally, improve myself so that I am not like this anymore. But if I don't know, then I won't know what to do and I'll just stay who I am.  

I am very confused right now. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated."
906,What kind of mental illness has the same effects as LSD?,"I want to know if there are some kind of mental illness ( schizophrenia, delusions etc ) that as similar effects as LSD has on the mind."
907,My brother is still friends with people that I cut off.,"So after I graduated highschool, I also decided to parted ways with some of my friends who I was with for 6 years, I don't know if it's a wise decision but I do not regret it, the friendship just got out of hands and turned out really toxic, so I leave them without even doing it properl. To be completely honest, I cherish the memories and moments I had with them but it is what it is, people do come and go. However I still have friends who are still friends with those people, so as my brother and it's very uncomfortable when I'm seeing these people out of nowhere, seeing them and when encountering with them gives me anxiety and depression and the only thing I can do is ran away from the situation. I just can't talk with them since I have communication issues and I ditched them just like that, so that makes me an awful person. I remember one time one of my former friends was knocking at my house, asking me to help her with her assignment and I felt really uncomfortable and couldn't leave my room and since she's still friends with my brother, my brother deadass let her in and I couldn't run away because I have nowhere to go and also my brother gave my new number with those people which is very inconsiderate of him. He knew, I'm no longer with those folks but anyways I just have no one to talk to about this and I just wanted to share this with you guys that cutting ties with people is hard and I get you."

909,How do I (18F) confront to my very traditional Asian parents about my potential ADHD ?,"Hello, so a bit more explanation on my situation. I'm a high schooler who just happen to be an year older than my peers. I've been showing related symptoms of ADHD since I was very young (such as fidgeting more than average and short attention span) but being in Asia we don't get much exposure to the mental health topic. I didn't learn about such thing until I went to study abroad as a highschool freshman. And ever since than I have wanted to let my parents know my concerns since its really affecting my study no matter how hard I try.

I have a brother who has more obvious symptoms than me, and my parents straight up refused to deal with it(my mother is a doctor and actually does have some basic knowledge of it, ironically)I am not allowed to get a job so getting medication on my own isn't a choice, my parents also keep the my ID to *prevent trouble*. 

So recently I've been realizing how much not being able to focus affected my life because of online classes, so I want to risk it and eventually get proper help. So if you guys have any advice on how I should communicate the issue to my parents it would be very helpful!! Thank you very much for reading this."

911,Voice and Music hallucinations stories,"1. Yesterday about midday I was just chilling on the sofa reading some articles on my phone. Nothing going on in the house. Husband was sleeping in the next room. The house was quite.. suddenly I hear ice cream truck music! I can't even explain how confused yet excited I was to hear this. I haven't heard that music in 5+ years. I'm not a big fan of ice cream but I haven't seen one of those trucks in so long that I got out of the couch and looked outside. It sounded like it was coming down my street so I got on my porch and looked out the window. But there was nothing. The music grew a bit louder and then it faded away, as if the truck passed by my house. But nope. No truck. No nothing.. just the music in my head


2. This morning I woke up before my alarm so I was just resting my eyes until my alarm went off. My husband was next to me playing video games. When he suddenly calls my name a couple times and asks me to get his phone charger that he left on my desk. Not even thinking I said sure and got up. As soon as I did I realized that what he asked was strange. He always has his charger on his night stand. Ever since we moved. Never unplugs or puts it anywhere else. Also he never puts stuff on my desk. I don't like clutter so he leaves my desk alone. But I'm up anyway and as I was about to walk to my desk I hear him calling me so I look at him to see what he wants. But he's still playing his game not paying attention to me. I'm confused at this point so I just stare at him trying to figure out if he actually said anything or if I was just hearing things. He realizes I'm staring at him and suddenly asks me for some breakfast. I say okay and on my way to the kitchen I go to my desk. And of course there's no charger. When I came back from the kitchen I asked if he called my name when I got up, he said no, that he was just playing his game and then asked me for breakfast.. 


Sorry this was long I just think this is very interesting. Let me know if you have experienced something like this!"
912,Frustration,"Hello

I want to vent some thoughts. My brother has been having some mental health issues. He has been unemployed for the past year and has been generally anxious. I try my best to communicate and talk him through things but I get frustrated sometimes. I can see the things he needs to work on to make himself better. I want him to be good and I can get frustrated when he doesn’t do anything about his situation. I think it is mostly frustration at myself. I feel like I should be able to help him and make him better and when it doesn’t work I get upset. It is at the point where the people around us can see us butting heads. The other night I was drunk and I got a little upset and rambled a bit to a family friend about how my brother needs to grow the fuck up and get his shit togethers. I feel bad that I got so angry and heated. I want to have more love and compassion. Things are looking up though. My brother has started anti anxiety meds. He also finally went to the hospital to get a pain he has been having checked out. He was so in his head and freaked out that he had something serious and I told him he was over reacting. I’ll spare the details but he is fine. 

My brother has been moody and him and my girlfriend have been fighting and I feel like I am caught in the middle doing he said she said. My girl was crying yesterday because of the situation. 

I am trying really hard to be the strong one here. I feel like I have been but I have moments of weakness and I get frustrated. I know we can work this out and everyone can be happy but I get frustrated when reality doesn’t make what is in my head. When I get frustrated I feel like a bad brother. 

Thank god for communication. I talk to my gf a lot about the situation. I talk to my brother a lot.  I keep trying to find the right words to make the situation all better but they never come. I think that might be the root of my frustration. Even though I never find the perfect words I think communication is the only thing keeping me afloat in these stormy seas  

Thanks if you read this."
913,How can I (F25) support my boyfriend (M30) when he has a depressive episode?,"Hello everybody, I hope you're doing well referring to the current situation.   


I'm with my boyfriend for around 1,5 years and we've been living together since 6 months.  
He's the sweetest person in the world, very caring, loving and empathic. We barely ever fight and even if we do, we make up within minutes.   
He suffers from depression and often sleeps very bad. Sometimes he has a few very dark days in a row where he gets very quiet and tired, feels incredibly sad and has low energy. He also gets incredibly  upset easily with tiny things like spilled water or something. I sometimes ask if I can do anything to support him but his response is ""Noone can help me right now."". In times like this, I hug and caress him as much as I can and he returns it so I think it's a good start. We often talk about therapy and he always says he's going to do it but he actually doesn't. He wants to get some insurance for non-viability and they don't accept people with mental health issues I guess. When the world get's dark around him I feel so helpless, too. I want to take it all away from him or at least the half of his burden. How can I be supportive? People with mental health issues, what would you love to receive from your partner?  
I love him so much and just want to help him."

915,Chronic fantasizing,"Hi guys, 

I hope everyone is well in the current climate.

So I will get straight to the point, I am a 23 year old male and not really gone through much trauma growing up. My parents divorced but all in all I can honestly say I had a good childhood. 

However I just wanted to put this out there, I fantasize. All. The. Time.

I find it quite difficult to fall asleep so I every night so I will make up and play out random situations in my head until I fall asleep. Or sometimes whilst driving or even watching t.v I will find myself daydreaming or fantasizing. 

I just wanted to put this out there to maybe get some advice, is this good or bad? Or is it something that everyone does? 

Cheers guys."

917,"Hi there, lovely people.","I recently just started an Instagram page where I talk about my mental health journey, some prevalent issues in my society. I come from India and in case you didn't know discussing mental health issues is still a pretty taboo concept over here. The scenario is changing slowly but we do have a long way to go.

My main reason to start a page was to merge two causes that I strong believe in. Animal care and mental health awareness.

Over here, in India, we have a lot of stray dogs and cats and there are not a lot of proper kenneling facilities available to take proper care of them. 
In my experience, animals, especially dogs, can be very therapeutic for people with mental health issues. Unfortunately not many people either don't realise about this form of therapy or have not heard about it.

So if a person needs an emotional support companion and a stray dog needs a loving home, why not have the two needs combined? Why not have the dog trained to be an emotional support pet?

I realise that this is more complex and tougher to accomplish than I make it sound but hey, it's a start. 

I will be documenting my journey over at instagram under **@pawsitea.**

I also have a blog that is still under works and I hope to publish it as soon as the quarantine restrictions are lifted over in my area.

Positive criticism appreciated :):)

Stay happy, y'all!!"
918,My (25M) friend (23M) is going down a dark path and I dont know what to do,"
We are both students studying abroad in a different country than ours. He’s destined to go back home in a few months time.

I dont know when this issue began, but he has developed a drinking issue. Bars are not open and he gets hungover 2 or 3 times a week at least, in his dorm. This doesn’t include drinking without getting drunk and/or hungover.

It is also, as far as I know, not his behavior to hook up with people. He did so anyways when he was drunk. Not sure on the story about that though.

Due to a small medical issue, the doctor has asked him not to drink for 7 days. He actually told me he’s just going to go back to drinking when the 7 days is up.

Back in February this year, he ended his relationship with his girlfriend back home. They are still talking to her. She studies clinical psychology and actually says that my friend has signs of alcoholism. Though I dont know if his alcohol issue began before or after the breakup.

He has told me a few days ago, that he has started going for counseling at the uni because lately hes been having more lows than highs in a week. He has agreed to talk to me soon about his issues also.

My friend here is a great guy and great friend. But his alcoholism and behavior seems to be spiraling downwards and I can’t help but worry. Is there anything I can do to help him without being overbearing? And when we talk eventually, is there anything I can say or ask him that’ll maybe help him a little bit? I’ve had people open up to me before about things, but something tells me this time its going to be different, though I can’t put my finger on why.

920,I’m just stupid and weak,"Has anyone here with depression ever been told, ‘You have it better than lots of people’? Well it’s true... for me at least... I’m really just worthless and lazy... I only do things when I’m motivated to do them and I think it means I’m only interested in myself. Or something. Like at school, I only raise my hand when I feel like answering and it’s really stupid. Why can I not be motivated all the time?

I don’t like loud noises and when my mum is just yelling instructions at me it makes me want to help with the cleaning or whatever even less. This morning I just wanted to lie in bed for a bit longer and my parents just came in talking loudly. And when I tell my dad to not shout he says he’s just talking loudly. I hate myself, I don’t want to die but it’s a struggle.

I am absolutely pathetic and an excuse for a human being, a baby is emotionally stronger than me. And I can’t even type because I get distracted so much. I feel like people get way more recognition when they do something controversial than something good. Like I don’t care about being famous but it feels pretty sad. 

And sometimes I just want to be alone. I decided last week that when I finish university (in like five years, should God permit it) I just want to travel, maybe go to Wales or somewhere and experience nature. But also because I want to distance myself and not have to be around people as much or just meet new people. I don’t know HOW I expect myself to ever get married if I am like this. Not that it’s bad to not get married and stay single. But like idk.

Something semi-relevant I’ve noticed is you kind of are more able to get worked up and frustrated when you’re around close family than friends. But I never ever got to experience something like a very close friendship idk bc like, my dad is a diplomat and we have to move every few years. And it’s sad, like, I know there’s WhatsApp and stuff but idk I just hate myself bc I can’t start a conversation without it being for some contrived reason like hapPy bIrThDaY.  Like I’m just stupid, I think I have social anxiety.

Right now my mum is at the door and I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE BUT NO ONE CARES. And I’m crying. I had to tell her so many times before she left and I even stabbed myself with a pen (again) a bit to make her leave so I’m just a toxic guilt-tripper now.

I bet so many people will reply to this bc if you paint yourself as a vulnerable and self-hating person as opposed to spelling out your problems calmly, you get more attention. But that’s just because I’m stupid and I really hate myself but Idc idk."
921,Can you explain your feelings of this if you understand,"Does anyone know that feeling it’s like you are not yourself, feels like I’m in a high when I’m really in my own head and thoughts and I spill a lot of things out to people with out thinking?"
922,I need an escape,"I feel like I’m suffocating. My chest is tight and heavy. My stomach hurts.

I was up all night crying because my entire body feels discomfort. Not even pain. I just feel uncomfortable/uneasy from the core of my body on out.

I didn’t have the best childhood or adolescence. I can’t remember a time I wasn’t depressed. Other than a few brief moments in my life. Some day/weeks are better than others. But there’s always that constant deep feeling of depression.

I feel so alone. I am not very close with my family and don’t have any real friends. I thought after meeting my husband things would get better, and for awhile it seemed that way. But just that one aspect has eased. And while I love my husband and I am so grateful for him, he does not understand what this is like. He did not grow up the same. His answer for everything is to “just pray about it,” and I appreciate the sentiment and I do pray... I don’t think that’s going to cut it.

I have never been suicidal or tried to kill myself but I have wanted to die and sometimes feel like death will be fine. 

I lack motivation to exercise, to find hobbies, to better my future. I’m stuck and I’m lost.

I don’t even know if what I’m writing right now makes sense together. I could literally go on and on..."
923,Diagnosed with depression but I think it’s something more...how do I still come out on top?,"I’ve grown up my whole life feeling down and like I’m drowning. But the longer I live the more inconsistent I am. I get crazy energy in short spurts that result in me being either really angry at the bad things happening in my life right now, or really motivated thinking I’m gonna be fine and it’s “all in my head”. While between these two extremes I’m just regular old depressed and exhausted me. I can’t see a doctor for a while. I’m in a bad situation that makes my life even more inconsistent making my problems harder to control. 

I have so many goals and ambitions but no energy. I can’t get out of the bad situation I’m in rn. I know that if I could I could heal and move forward with my mental illness. But right now I’m living with a bipolar crazy narcissistic person who makes my life harder. 

How can I stay consistent and heal? I feel like I’m getting worse. I want to die most the time I’m down and I feel physically and mentally ill."
924,what type of message would you want from a friend if you were depressed?,"A friend of mine seems to be going through a rough time, has ghosted/stopped messaging me a lot just sent me two saying she's distancing herself from people and that she has her moments in life

I haven't overwhelmed her with messages at very most one a week. Been 3 weeks since I've sent her one just wondering ideas what to send or what messages people who have ghosted others would want them to be sent

Just after some ideas, thank you"
925,Business name idea - please help!!!,"So at the minute I’m doing a mental health blog and sharing some illustrations of mine. I’d like to turn this into a business and create  merchandise. 

Can you help me decide on a name? I like alliterations, idioms and oxymorons. Been thinking about this for months and haven’t come up with anything that is catchy enough and creative #mentalhealth"
926,This ballon is about to pop.,"I feel like when you blow up a ballon and it pops. Or you touch something hot, and drop it instantly. No control, just reaction. I feel like I have no control. I want to hurt people. Want to die. Threaten people without even knowing. I post on here all my thoughts. I know no one can help. I guess I do it for us."
927,Apologize or let time heal?,"Its gonna be a long rant, sorry and tks in advance for going through it.

2 years ago, I met someone at work in a summer camp. We kinda flirted the whole season but Id never let thing escalate more because of many different reasons. I said hurtful things out of fear of commitment so that this person would reject me and acted very childish and immaturely and I deeply regret that ever since. 

The last time we saw each other we were at their place in a camping site (at the end of the summer) and I told them about some of my issues and that it was hard for me to deeply trust someone. They understood but probably felt hurt. They told me they’d wait for me to be ready. They gave me a lift back home and there very unexpectedly my dad was waiting and shouted at them that I was his little girl, that they were dangerous (my dad claimed that he saw us on the road and that my friend was going over the speed limit). My dad pushed me on the stairs to go inside and I ran and locked myself in my room. My parents were standing outside and started questioning me. I said that my dad had no rights to follow me and insult my friend amongst other things.
I told them I wanted to kill my self.
And they didn’t take it seriously.
And I attempted.
I texted my friend and told them I was sorry that my dad shouted and insulted them. And that I was making a mistake but that I didnt know what else to do. They tried to understand what I was doing but I rejected the help. I scared them a lot Im very aware of that.

I don’t really remember what happened after that. I know I texted them multiple time, and I think its to apologize but Im not sure. I erased our text convo and everything that happened the year after that event feels like a big blur.

They got together with another person from the camp which I also knew and was friends with. 
Im very happy for them. Because they are both very nice people and deserve each other.

Today its the birthday of the second person I introduced. And I don’t know if I should tell them HB. Because I feel like I should just disappear from both their lives.

Idk if I should apologize in a long text. Or just let everything flow. Its very selfish because I just want to forget about all that happened cause I think about it almost everyday and it haunts me.
But I dont want to bring back the pain they endured because of me.

I was rude and rejected their help, made them both worry about me and caused them stress. I feel so horrible.

Thank you so much for reading all of it.
Hope you have a nice day."
928,I’m overly compassionate towards myself,"I’ve had 3 exams all of which I had a 23 hour window to write them in and for every single one of them I got near 50% and even less as the exams went on for them done. So in the end I didn’t submit any of my exams. 

Instead of feeling like my whole life is on fire (which I don’t want to feel anyway because there are solutions to solve it, so feeling like I’m drowning never helps...)

I am really relaxed and I don’t feel as if I’ve let myself down 😭

I do this a lot. The whole of my life I’ve been messing up and stopped being hard on myself because it doesn’t help but this is bad because I need to be hard on myself to a degree? So that I actually get things done. I don’t feel guilty to the slightest. 🤣

Does anyone else have this problem? All I do is resolve to do better next time but I don’t even have a fire under my butt. What is going on 😭😭😭 I don’t want to live in the basement for the rest of my life 

By the way I am smart and capable. This probably sounds like an ego trip, but like I definitely know I can do it, which is what makes it worse. Why do I not do it?

I do struggle when I’m in the middle of doing it but instead of carrying on I give up. Please why am I a loser"

931,I lose it when I lose things,"Is something wrong with me? I've never seen a mental health professional or been diagnosed with anything but recently I am feeling like I should. I cannot handle losing things. It fills me with the worst frustration you can imagine. When I can't find something I literally cannot think about anything else. Nothing in the entire world matters until I find it. I have in the past tore apart my room by pushing every single item, including furniture, to one side of the room, and then sifted through it item by item moving things to the other side until I found what I was looking for. I still get so angry when I think about an ipod I lost EIGHT YEARS ago... we literally moved out of the house. We emptied the ENTIRE HOUSE and I still couldn't find it, even though I am 100% sure the last time I used it was in the house. My mom thinks it is crazy and doesn't understand when I tear apart the house just to find one inconsequential item but once I realize I have lost it, nothing else matters until I find it."
932,Dr won't diagnose,"I have been having hallucinations for awhile now and recently havebstsrted to hear my name almost chanted. I think or I know its not real but it's as if the people in the store or post office or wherever are doing it. Like I can hear them even if not close. I recently spent a whole night in the shower scrubbing because I couldn't stop feeling bugs crawling on me.

I'm not sure anyone believes me. Not my wife or therapist. My psychiatrist has upped my meds three visits in a row but still questions me as if I'm a child. Not sure if I should be taking the meds if he doesn't believe me."
933,Anti-Anxiety medication,"I don’t know how to start this. I was supposed to talk to a psychiatrist in February. I talked to them yesterday. When I first learned that I was supposed to talk to a psychiatrist, I didn’t know what it was about but I said sure to the idea. Now, the day comes and I start panicking. The psychiatrist could probably tell I was not okay, and they asked me if I wanted to reschedule. I did. This isn’t what’s bothering me though. Apparently my parent, therapist, and the psychiatrist had all been in contact talking about anti-anxiety medication. The problem I have with taking medication, is just the fact that I have to. That probably doesn’t make sense. This might sound bad, but I just don’t want to be diagnosed with anything. I just want to be normal. Even when and if I get diagnosed with GAD, and my life goes on the same, just the fact that I know that I have it. I guess the problem is that I don’t want to have anxiety, which I can’t control."
934,I dont know anymore.," I'm a student who is having problems, my education money is running out and I failed alot of my tests. I've run out of hope, Im in a country in the gulf and kinda of afraid to die because of my ideologies and sexuality. I'm considering suicide."
935,"I’ve been stuck for years, please help!","For the past few years I’ve been stuck in a rut. I’ve started to realize it’s a personal rut and I don’t know how to fix it or get out. About 6 years ago I was in a motorcycle wreck that left my leg pretty messed up. I can still use it but not great. I’ve always been an athletic person and 6 months on crutches and a year of physical therapy pretty much wiped it out mentally for me. Now I’ve gained a lot of weight and always say to myself “ok this day... this day I’ll start changing to be better” and the day comes and I just withdraw deeper into my own mind and somehow it’s too hard for me. Which sucks because I really have an amazing life. I have a wife that means so much to me, we just had our first baby right in the middle of Covid, I have an amazing job that I love, a great small group of friends, and a great plan for the future with my job. But somehow I still find myself depressed, sulking, anxious, and generally putting myself down. I wake up every morning hating myself more and more. I haven’t really looked in the mirror in a long time. I’m not who I used to be and I know that’s ok... but I’m also very unhappy with myself. I know I can eat better and do it... but then I get so scared to do it. Which I know might sound foolish but Im stuck. I will make a plan and get it all ready to go, and then bail out of fear. I will make a few days of food and let it go bad in the fridge because I’m just nervous, scared, all of it. I have a small thought that I CAN DO THIS... but I then let my depression talk me out of it with excuses and why I can’t do it. My son is almost 3 months old and I’m already scared that if I don’t change myself, then I’ll be the father I never wanted to be. I want to be able to enjoy my son growing up and taking lots of photos with him because my abusive father has all my baby photos. Which I will never see again. I want to be happy to take a family photo with my wife and kid because I’m so proud of them, but I hate myself so much that I force myself not to be happy. I try so hard to find the good in everything but I somehow push myself to the bad. I don’t know what to do anymore. Or how to kickstart myself and get into a better frame of mind. I want to be able to lose 5 pounds and say I CAN DO THIS! Without my mind telling me I’m not good enough to do it. I want to be able to take a family photo without immediately sweating and panicking when asked to do so. I’m just really lost."
936,Has anyone here taken Wellbutrin? And how did having a cocktail effect you while on it?,My friend was in Wellbutrin years ago and she says if she had one drink it would be like 10. I was just wondering if this is a common experience.
937,One of my parents is hateful and wants to die,"Ok there’s so much to cover but I’m going to do my best here to stay on track.  I’m a gay man (24)...  My parents have been married for almost 30 years now.  I had a great life, given everything my parents could offer.  I love them so much.  But all my mom does is talk about wanting to die and how much she hates everything.  She says he has depression and anxiety but doesn’t take meds (from what I can tell) and when we spoke about her going to therapy she confessed she doesn’t tell the doctor everything and is scared too.  Idk why.  She alo has a negative attitude towards everything.  It’s always “I hate this” “I hate that”, blah blah blah.  It’s gotten to the point that I just stop her when she is about to talk and say “if it’s not nice or positive don’t say it, I don’t care for the useless negativity” and she stops talking.  I can’t stand being around her anymore because she gets upset over everything.  The smallest detail sets her off.  She comes home from work, the store, a friends, etc. and starts yelling.  We could be having the best day and she comes home and ruins it because she starts yelling over literally anything.  She also yells at my brother all the time.  Yes he’s got a “chill, lazy” vibe.  Very LA surfer dude vibe tbh.  So she just yells for no reason.  She tells him he’s ungrateful, stupid, etc.  I defend him because I understand him more and how to get him to do shit.  But it’s just so much to handle I feel bad.  He wants a relationship with her but we both acknowledged they’re polar opposites and he won’t ever really get along with her.  Another thing with her is she has this hoarding issue.  She has such a hard time letting little things go.  She hoards crafts, starts projects but never finishes, she can’t get rid of stuff that’s single use.  It’s been really hard because my parents are moving and are getting rid of a lot but it’s always “what if I need this” “what if I need that” and then if something she never ever touched or even opened gets donated or thrown out she explodes and starts screaming and saying we all hate her and disrespect her.  That’s not the case.  We love her and respect her but we can’t have this shit around well taking pics and showing the house to sell it.  She lived with her parents until she was 27/28, only has an associates degree, moved in with my dad at 29 and then had kids.  She never really lived on her own.  She seems so unhappy and it worries me because she loves pills and medication.  She collects them like old pez containers.  She drinks a lot now, smokes a lot of weed and takes these pills.  I could only imagine what she would do if my parents got a divorce.  Anyway, I just don’t know what to do anymore, I never thought I would pick sides but I really don’t want my mom around me anymore if this is how she is going to be.  I don’t live my life in a negative, hateful filter.  Yes life is hard and it’s sucks but our world is so beautiful, I love my friends, the people I meet, the stories I hear, etc.  it’s just hard having someone around that would rather be dead..."
938,Can anyone explain mental durability?,Some common questions would be where does the damage come from and yeah? Is it luck?
939,Nightmares,I keep having vivid nightmares of ants and I keep waking up and seeing them on the wall even though I touch it and they aren't there. I'm wide awake. And I get so paranoid I think they're crawling in my ears and are all over my body. And I have panic attacks. It's really affecting what I do and my sleep. I don't want to sleep and I don't want to leave my room bc I don't want the ants to be there even tho I know they're not.
940,Questioning reality,The title really says it all. I don't know what is real. I feel like this life is fake and doesn't exist. I hate it. I don't feel alive. What is the point of being alive ? I feel things yeah but I feel so disconnected like I'm watching my life in third person. Nothing feels real. Maybe nothing is real. I keep having really bad intrusive thoughts of hurting myself as well as other things. Idk what to do.
941,"Recovery is possible, but it is a journey, not a destination.","Mentally, I fell apart and thought I would never recover. I struggle with bi polar disorder and depression and although there's highs, there's more lows. I was on a downward spiral after my ex left me, and I was stuck in my home town working a dead end job. I moved and now live with my best friends, but things didn't improve right away. I thought it was an opportunity to fix my life but it felt like things kept going wrong. I was very broke because I could find a job and the part time job I started working only paid $150 a week sometimes. I was constantly sick because of stress. I had many of potential relationships fall through and all the rejection was starting to get to my head. I thought to myself I wanted my life to end, but I didn't want to cause all my friends and family heart break. I decided I only wanted this part of my life to end. In about a month I really changed. I blocked out all negative thoughts about myself and changed my way of thinking. I got a new job at a corporate office and am making triple what I did before. I started exercising and eating right. I've lost a little bit of weight which has really helped with how I feel about my self image. I'm so much more confident and I've invested in a new, better apartment and even a new car. I devote time to myself each day so I can continue to build up my mental health. I feel a lot better but recovery is certainly a journey and not a destination. I know this is long, but I really wanted to share because I'm so proud of myself. I've come a long way and I know my self worth now. I dont let people or other things tear me down. I hope this helps other people realize that it is possible to get better. Never give up."
942,I feel too responsible to commit suicide,"I don't know if it's normal, but suicide has been a thought lingering at the back of my mind since I was 12. I've never been diagnosed with a mental illness (maybe cos I've never seen a psychiatrist) and I don't think I'm depressed or anything like that (though I have felt that at times). So I don't know why I keep thinking to myself, ""suicide is an option"".

When I contemplate suicide, I can't help but think of it as an extreme form of selfishness, because there are people by your side who care for you, and death only tortures the living. I think of my family and friends, and the unfortunate soul who would have to find my dead body and report it to the police. So ultimately, I don't think I'll commit suicide because I don't want to burden others like that. This sense of responsibility to live not for myself, but for the people around me has been what's holding me back all this while.

But when you think of suicide as an option, who's to say you won't actually do it in the spur of the moment? After all, death can be quick and it'll be too late for regrets. How can I stop considering it as one of my choices?"
943,"Helping a loved one with selfharm, suicidal thoughts, low self-esteem, and potential depression","(M17) I've met my GF (F17) about half a year ago, and since then i've been noticing signs of depression, self harm and self hatred in her. She cut herself many times, and always says how she is worthless, no matter how much i tell her otherwise. But the worst proble is that she doesnt want to go to therapy, or even just a check by a psychologist. I feel like that amount of energy she spends on fighting all things that i tell her about helping herself is magnitudes larger than the entire fkng sun annual light output. No matter how much i tell her do get help, and that she is better than she thinks, she always finds the most absurd way to do the exact opposite of what i told her. I tell her that i actually like talking to her and spending time with her? (who would have fkng thought after half a year of a close realtionship, right???) She tells me that ""But there were people that didnt like talking to me, so that doesn't count""  
I tell her that she should get professional help, because of self harm and suicidal thoughts? She tells me ""Thats just a teenager stuff (She is 18 next month, wtf?), nothing bad, its ok"". And every time i talk to her about that she first tries as hard as she can to ignore whatever i am saying, be it ""Hey, i am worried about you, i think you should get help"" or ""You are better than you think, look, this is why:"", and then, after she runs out of absurd reasons why she is bad and at the same time why she is ok, she just cries, and tries to evade the talk, and then she just stops talking about it until we talk about somethin else  


I am running out of ways to help her, and become increasingly frustrated, because she spends all her energy opposing me, no matter what i do and no matter how i try to help. I've been in her state before in a previous relationship, and my ex-GF helped me by insisting on getting professional help, but i am trying this here and nothing works, the more i try to help her, the more energy she spends on making sure that my intetentions leadto nowhere and she stays where she is, hating herself, cutting herself, thinking that she will die soon.  


One part of me really wants to help, but another is running out of ways to do so, because no matter what i do she will do everything to do nothing(And something tells me that if she spent all this energy helping herself, she would have been a happiest A+ student, two years ago)   


What should i do???"
944,Am I dead and this is hell?,"I had a close brush with death when I was 14. Since then, as I’ve gotten older, life and my mental health has took a turn for the worse: addiction, anxiety, depression,etc. sometimes I really think I’m in hell paying for my wrongdoings. Anyone else relate?"
945,I hate how I can't post literally anything on Reddit without having therapy shoved down my throat,"And before you ask, yes, I'm in therapy. I've been in therapy since 2015. I've changed therapists yearly, since then. And no, I haven't found the 'the right one' because this simply isn't the case. I do not respond to therapy and some people here simply won't accept the fact that not everyone is helped by therapy. Before 2015, I used to go to psychologists but that didn't help much either. So I guess we can take professional help out of the equation because it simply isn't for me.

At this point, there isn't much that's going to help me. I know I have adopted a very defeatist point of view but it's simply the truth. I have seeked professional help, I have changed my lifestyle in major ways (diets, hobbies, relationships, sport, etc) and I've also been through multiple treatment trials with many types of meds (SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives, etc). My depression hasn't improved a bit. My symptoms have never been as severe as they are now. My only emotional outlet is Reddit, since I don't want to be a burden for my family and friends. So I would often come here and get things off my chest. Most of the time I wasn't even looking for advice, I just wanted to vent. Yet almost every single post of mine becomes plagued with people preaching therapy and explaining how ""my life would be fixed with therapy"". And yes, I've tried mentioning in my posts that I am in therapy and it's not helping, yet people here insist that ""I just haven't found the right therapist yet"", ""I just need to open up more in therapy"", ""I just need a different perspective"" etc. It has become so tiring. I understand that the intention behind this isn't a bad one, but it's become so repetitive that at this point, these people have become some sort of video game NPCs. I understand that therapy helps some people but give me a break. We're not all the same, and there's many people besides me who are in the same boat. All this wave of 'therapist preachers' on Reddit has made me become even more depressed and I feel like I have lost the only safe place where I could come and speak my heart out.

Just a few days ago, I made a post on r/Music asking if anyone ever went through phases where they didn't enjoy any type of music at all. My post got flooded with people telling me to seek therapy and that a therapist could help me discover the roots of my issue. Ironically, I did bring this up in therapy last year and yes, the issue is still there. My therapist assured me that 'my love for music will eventually return' but I see no signs of it ever happening and it's been like this for a few years now (around 3-4 years).

I don't mean to come off as rude or inconsiderate. I'm genuinely happy that some people can find comfort and relief in therapy but I am not one of those people. And I think I've got to the point where I can safely assume that after these years, it's just not working. And I hate how, despite all this, people still keep shoving therapy down my throat. I wish I still had a place where I could vent without people attacking me like this."
946,"Am I a bad person by wanting to know what happens after my suicide, to the point that I want to fake it?","Okay,

made a lil throwaway account because I rather not have this linked to my account.

I dont really want to die.

But I dont really want to live either.

I want to vanish.

But, I want to commit suicide. But not for the dying part, for the reaction of other people.

I have people in my near vicinity who commited suicide, and I realised that only AFTER their death, people spoke about this person truly.

I want to commit suicide in a horrible way, and then see what happens to the people I know. Will people cry? Will \*she\* cry? How fast are people going to move on? What will happen after my parents clear my room and find porn, drugs and poems about how I *really* feel. What happens to my lil' bro?What will happen with my body? How does the person who finds it react?

These are all questions that I want answered, but commiting suicide will never- ever- ever answer them. Also, asking people directly will skew the results- because people don't know how they'd actually react.

My sister's horrible morning sickness due to pregnancy, her 2 y/o son who often throwing tantrums, and her husband's yelling at their son.

951,Perfectionism and feelings of inadequacy coming out via video games,"Does anyone else have this experience too? I feel like I beat myself up over video games more than a person should. 

Right now I am playing *Hollow Knight*, which is notoriously difficult. It is quite common to lose to some bosses over and over again until success. I *know* it is difficult. I tell myself it’s difficult. But that doesn’t stop the feelings of self-doubt come out in really absurd ways. Here’s an example of a train of thought.

*Well, it looks like I died again. If I can’t succeed now, I’m never going to succeed at the hardest possible difficulty. There are people on YouTube doing some amazing feats of skill. I’ll never be as good as them. I guess it’s not even worth it to continue.*

This thought process then starts to bleed over into other areas of my life. My job. My relationships. I start to brood over my perceived inadequacies in all facets of my life.

Over a fracking video game. Why do I compare myself to experts and masters of the skill? Why do I feel like I need to be the absolute best to enjoy something?

I do enjoy games. And I know that my thinking is irrational and absurd. But knowledge of our issues doesn’t automatically lead to dealing with them.

How can I learn to incorporate things I enjoy doing into a more healthy and positive way?"

I feel as if majority of the time my emotions are neutral I feel neither happy nor sad. And in the back of my head -almost I feel I should be feeling something as long as I’m alive, but don’t know what I’m feeling. I can’t stress this enough.. confusion seems to be the word brought up most in my head. I’ve started to recognize feelings/emotions I don’t have names for. I feel as though I’m also confusing emotions with something else, but I’m not sure. I have a few hundred thoughts running through my head at times. When my brain is stimulated I think I’m happy everything else I feel lazy, unmotivated. I push myself when I realize what I’m doing, but ever since I was a kid I always thought I had tunnel vision. If that even has anything to do with it. Not sure if what I put here is informative enough, but i did my best in the mental state I’m at. —Just typing this out Ive started to think I need to take some situations slower but pls lmk I want more opinions—"
955,[serious] Not sure if this is the right place for some help /advice? Not sure...,"I'm a 28 year old male from England. I have struggled with my mental health for many years. Even as a kid I was the quite, shy one. As I grew older it come to me that it wasn't being shy it was actually social anxiety. My teen years I had a fair few good friends, we would hang out, party on weekends etc life seemed sweet, but I'd still struggle to get my words out if there was people I didn't know or more than 3 people in the same room.

When I was 16 a few bad things happened that hurt me emotionally and ended up trying to take my life by taking a huge amount of my brothers ritalin and ibrophen. I got ""some"" councilling after which in a way helped with my thinking of life.

As time went on, I have a beautiful child who is always my safeguard for when I'm feeling low, I just think about how she keeps me going.
The advise or guidance I'm looking for... Basically I have my lows and highs, a few years ago it was spaced out I'd be happy for a few months then I'd feel complelty shit for a good week. Then it become more regular, it would be a few good weeks then a shit week. Now it seems its every week, I can be fine driving along in my car then bang I just want to cry and go home and lock my self away.

I have been on a few different anti depressants and taken them for the recommended time for them to work but they just make me feel like a zombie or worse than I did. I've was reffered to my local mental health support hospital to speak to professionals told them everything from childhood memories to life now and they just said it was depression.

I stopped going there to as it seemed pointless...
I get very aggetated at times over silly things  like my phone constantly going off... Being stuck behind a car for to long... Being around people to long or sometimes just being around people full stop. I have to come home and be in silence until I feel happy again. I can't hold down a relationship with a women as I just love my own company to much, but hate myself when I look in a mirror. 

Is that selfish?

I still suffer with the axiety side to, I make excuses for not attending invites to places or doing things with friends or family just because I feel to anxious that I'm being judged constantly. I have very low self esteem about myself"
956,How do you recover from over-thinking or thinking to hard?,Feels like you put in effort that you'll never get back.
957,Is this real? Am I real? Of course I am. Even if i wasnt its the best I got so I gotta go with it.,"I'm a 21 year old female that has never been diagnosed before (ive always been too scared to do it). I struggle with recovery for my ED and I have been told by multiple therapist that I should consider medication. I wouldnt say i had a horrible childhood but my parents had a nasty divorce and maybe a few stray things here and there. From ages 11 to 19 I was suicidal and did a lot of stupud stuff. Both sides of my family have history of mental illness. 

Now I dont know whats happening. I call what happens dissociation but im not sure thats accurate. Its been happening daily for a long period of time (maybe a little over a year). The easiest way to explain it is everything sounds looks and feels fake. Like im in a video game and I'm self aware. I feel like I'm going crazy, but im self aware that its not a normal thing and its just in my head and that makes me not crazy. But then I go down a rabbit hole of am I or am i not. I am starting to have small breakdowns more frecently. I look at my hands and freak out. Like they arent mine and after a fee moments I snap back. I can stare ay my reflection and it becomes so distorted I dont recognize myself. 

I use to love makeup and politics and creating things and movements and now every thing I love is becoming something that tiggers something inside me that either makes me so anxious my tummy hurts for hours or I get so sad i feel like I cant even move. 

I'm terrified of medications. Ive seen what they can do first hand and I dont want to be like that. I dont know what to do so i came here. I'm not really expecting someone to have a magical cure all. I think I just wanted to tell someone. If anyone has any advice on coping I'd love anything."
958,psychoanalysis,"Just a question for anyone who's either in psychoanalysis, is an analyst, or has studied it: how does transference work to help the analysand? Any examples of maternal transference being ""worked through"" successfully?

I ask what that might look like because there are feelings of attachment coming up in my therapy that I'm having trouble bringing to session. I keep telling myself that it's unnecessary to discuss them because I ""understand"" them on my own, but it might just be fear of trusting and communicating with my analyst. I tend to speak to her as if she's this disembodied voice behind the couch, I rarely address her in the second person, and I'm often unsure of what greetings and goodbyes ""should"" feel like. From what I've read, I understand that discussing the relationship with the analyst is important, so I'm hoping that a specific example of the benefits will give me some more incentive to open up next session. Thanks in advance!

962,For the first time in about 7 years I found passion and reason!,"  

I’m 20-something and had lost my direction in life. I moved to a foreign country after finishing what is the equivalent of high school in my country, to study something I do not enjoy and seek a future, that people made me believe was mine, but for the last few years, I’ve been working dead-end jobs and couldn’t even find the desire to start my studies. I used to play videogames all the time in high school because it made me happy, but now it’s just a habit and most of the time I don’t even enjoy it.

Probably like many of you, I consume a lot of media and about 2 months ago after watching a simple movie, hearing a few specific sentences in it and having a few discussions with myself - something struck me like nothing has in 7 years and for some reason I had the desire to express myself. I’ve always wanted to do something with arts (as I did a lot in my teen years), but was never really sure how to approach it. Now that I had passion seemingly coming from nowhere, I decided to write little stories and draw them on a few pieces of paper, then I decided to transfer them on my laptop and did my first little animation, and for the first time in sooo long, I felt like a have a purpose in my life.

I wanted to share this little story with you, because I never really talk about those things with people in my life and hiding behind a username online is easier. I know my case is nothing in comparison to many of yours, I’ve never suffered from depression, severe anxiety or any other mental health issue, but I was in a very dark place for a very long time. Many of you here are younger than me and I hope you can see that sometimes something as simple as a movie or a single sentence is more than enough to force you to find happiness. Something coming into your life at a completely random moment can change your whole idea on how to live your life and find a purpose. Don’t give up on life, life mend no harm in those dark times, and know there is at least a chance for happiness for all of us.

Here’s the little animation I did, some of you might find it interesting.

964,Should I talk with my fiancée about my self image problems?,"Short info about me. 24m had a pretty abusive dad growing up which kinda shattered my confidence and self image. Also suffer from depression, GAD, Panic disorder and agoraphobia which doesn't help. Working through it though.

So I have my ups and downs like all people but I always have a hard time with my self image. I always feel bad about my looks. Don't like going to places like malls because I feel bad about it etc. This is my problem and I have to deal with it. 

One thing that doesn't help however is that my fiancée(22f) is a huge bts fan. I mean I don't really have a problem with them. They have 2-3 songs I like but their music is not really for me. This might seem dumb but they are really good looking guys. Like reaaaally good looking. And having her looking at them and drooling over them on a daily basis really exacerbates the self image problem. Feels like it is a standard I can't really live up to. She doesn't drool over them that obviously around me but it is very transparent. Accidentelly found some fan-ertoica on put computer she forgot to delete. I still don't have a problem with this. My mindset is whatever you jerk to is your buisness, everyone has a right to fantasize. It all trickles down to me feeling bad over my looks and trying to meet an impossible standard.

Her being very good looking doesn't help either since I feel like i'm not up to her standard and that the standard I need to live up to is these kpop Idols she find so attractive.

Should I talk with her about this? And whats would be a good way to bring it up?  Like I don't want her to feel guilty since she hasn't done anything wrong. The problem is entierly mine. Should I maybe just leve it alone and keep working on myself and suffer in silence?

I just want to hear the experiences of others to know if people experience similar things or if I’m all alone. ❤️
969,Feel betrayed.,"I am finding it very difficult to love someone.  

Prior to my current girlfriend, I dated someone for five years.  I almost married her, but she left and we broke up over unreconcilable differences.  At the time I hated her for leaving.  I also hated that a month later she moved in with her now husband.

2 years after breaking up I was in a healthier relationship and taken some time to process emotionally what had happened.  The anger had become a weight holding me back from being happy.  Then my uncle passed away from ALS.  Death has a way of making other issues seem small, so I called my ex and apologized for the emotional pain I had caused which led in part to us breaking up.  

I felt like a weight left my body.  All my anger and resentment began melting away.  However, almost immediately I got an incessant stream of text messages from her husband cussing me out and blaming me for all the problems they had in THEIR marriage.  I had to go to a funeral in the morning, but I wouldn't be able to turn my phone off as I needed to remain reachable to help with the service, so I finally insisted that my uncle's funeral is tomorrow, please out of respect do not text or call me.

I didn't hear anything for a long time.  My ex and her husband live in Philadelphia, and I live in Pittsburgh.  However, occasionally my ex would drive to Pittsburgh for a business conference and invite me to lunch.  Slowly, we started working through the awkwardness and residual pain, and eventually we managed to be friends.  I made it clear upfront that I was in a relationship, and I was happy for her marriage.

We would text and talk on the phone just once a month.  Typically she called me.  We were mutually supportive and affirming of our romantic partners.  

When COVID-19 got bad, I did something I shouldn't have.  I admitted to her that I still occasionally thought of her romantically.  However, she didn't reciprocate those feelings.  I understood, told her I wanted her to be happy, and if her marriage makes her happy, then I support her decision.  I never brought up romantic interest again.

Then this week I get a text from my ex in the middle of the night.  She is scared.  Her husband has been drinking, and she cannot take her relationship with him anymore.  She asks me if I still love her and could we get back together.  I am shocked and scared for her.  I tell her that yes I do still care deeply for her and think about her romantically occasionally.  However, I told her that I was worried about her physical and emotional safety.  My best friend had gone through a divorce, and it was a soul crushing experience for her.  I advised my ex that she had a lot of decisions to think about.  It wasn't healthy to jump into a new relationship.  She should go stay with friends and family to be safe.  I wanted her to really think through her decision and make the right decision for her.  I told her that I would pray on the right decision too and talk with my pastor.  My primary concern was her physical safety.  I texted every mutual friend we had, because I was afraid that she might have to sleep in her car.  I kept pleading with her to pick up the phone and assure me she is physically safe.  She scared the crap out of me.  I thought her husband was dangerous and had hit her.

 Finally, a number shows up on my phone that I don't recognize.  It was her husband.  He starts cussing me out and tells me that he had been texting me the whole time to get proof that I was hitting on his wife.  He starts laying into me with embarrassing information I had told my ex in confidence about struggles with mental illness, gas lighting me, and being emotionally abusive.  I eventually can't take it, hang up, and block his number.  

I text my ex and tell her that was not ok at all.  I have done domestic violence prevention training and mental health first aid training.  I have friends who have struggled with abusive spouses, addiction, and thoughts of suicide.  My own brother struggles with those issues and I have had to call 911 in the middle of the night to save my friends' lives and my brother's life.  If I get a call like that, I will take you seriously, and making sure you are physically safe is my priority.  I told her that joking about her husband threatening her was not funny or ok.  It is emotionally manipulative.  She scared the hell out of me, and I woke up many of her friends in the middle of the night asking them to check on her.  In no way was anything that happened ok.  

It was unfair as well.  I confessed one time about romantic feelings.  She told me she didn't feel the same way, and I never brought it up again.  I only confessed romantic feelings because her husband using my ex's phone and pretending to be her texting me in an emergency in the middle of the night asked me.  That doesn't seem like proof of me secretly hitting on her.  My ex and her husband live on the opposite side of the state from me.  They are married.  My ex calls me maybe once a month.

I felt betrayed by someone, my ex, I considered a friend.  Her husband told her that he planned on impersonating her with her phone, faking an emergency text, and she agreed.  She told me she thought it was hilarious watching me get scared for her safety and ""outing"" me for my feelings.  I told her that was cruel.  Friends don't joke about domestic violence.  She brought up how much I hurt her when we broke up.  That this was payback.  

That really hurt.  I thought her life was in danger.  I no I shouldn't, but I really hate my ex and her husband right now.

I told her that when I was in middle school.  Bullies learned of a girl I liked.  They got her instant messaging password, pretended to be her, told me she liked me and got me to confess my feelings.  They printed out the transcript, made photocopies, and covered the school hallways with it.  The entire school laughed at me.  In the gym locker room, those same four guys pinned me to the floor and took turns trying rape me like the ""faggot, their words,"" I was.  The whole time they sexually assaulted me they mocked me for tricking me.  I told my ex girlfriend, your husband sounded like and said many of the same things those bullies did.  That was not ok 

I had to fight them off me.  Through middle school and high school as a bisexual kid in the deep south, I fought off bullies constantly.  Being LGBT in the Biblebelt was hard.  I had to learn to fight or mock my bullies early to survive.  I have a visceral and nearly unforgivable hatred for bullies and domestic abusers.

I felt betrayed by my ex.  I trusted her.  I thought we were friends."

971,"osdd , depression","so i have osdd and severe depression and anxiety ,and for awhile now i noticed that my way of thinking and moral are not under my control and changes depending on the situation for example; what is happening with police and black people, when first i saw these i felt angry cause of the situation because it's unjust and wrong and it made me cry, is what i felt, but then after a while i see these stories on social media it feels like i agree with fucking racists and at the same time i don't and for some reason it felt like i had lost my feelings, tbh idek what's wrong and right, actually my sense of value, of good and bad gets reversed, ffs what's wrong with me; tho i thing osdd is the major problem here; sorry. ps.. for as long as i can remember i never felt in control of my self, like i've been living in a dream, and even rn it's like i'm on auto pilot i don't remember what i wrote, or i don't want to remember idk. anyways does anyone knows whats wrong with me?"

974,Keep getting bouts of severe depression,I tend to get really depressed for no reason and even suicidal thinking my life's been completely ruined. Though I tend to recover after a goodnights ssleep and I'm genuinely happy again and make loads of plans to sort my life out which is in huge mess but I suddenly can start to feel as if I can make fix everything.

975,sexual trauma and the possibility of false reporting,"hey, I am Kathy and from my personal experience, I can say what sexually assaulted or sexual trauma can do to you even after years of that incident happening. when I was in school I was sexually assaulted by one of the male teachers and I was just in class 6 back then. I was confused but could never gather the courage to speak up about it to anyone. but however, times have changed and we have several platforms and counselors with whom we can talk and gather information to help us out of the situation. but it's important to know what are the consequences of sexual assault on the victim's mental health and what are the chances of false reporting.

I am dealing with bad anxiety and depression as it is and I knew I needed off of social media before all of this even happened. What’s your take? Especially if you are black, I would like to know. I don’t want to be insensitive and non caring because I know how important it is to be a white ally and I fully exercise that in my everyday life. I feel like at this point everyone is judging each other by how much activism they do and I would like to do more but my mental health is suffering. Then I feel guilty because I’m sure it feels worse to be black in America now"
978,What happens if you fail school because of mental health problems?,"For context, I live in Mexico and I've always struggled with my mental health, but it got way worse during the whole quarantine and studying from home thing. I've taken many online tests for mental health (from both official and unofficial sites) and they've all given me the same results, that I probably have depression, anxiety and ADD/ADHD.

I also told my mom about my mental problems and how I almost attempted suicide and told her to help me get therapy, but she didn't want to. I'm now really scared because I don't want to repeat the school year even though before quarantine I've had really good grades. I just want everything to be ok."

Issues since March 2020:

1) my job was supposed to start in March. Visa got delayed due to the lockdowns. 
2) no pay since January.
3) made a stupid mistake of moving to a new apartment in February which was 350$ more than the previous rental.
4) can't go back to my home country because of the lockdowns.
5) 2000$ in credit card debt. Will only be able to pay once I start getting my salary.
6) I am just working for 2 hours a day, which is pathetic. I have so much to do. Just feeling unmotivated and purposeless.
7) I was falling for a close friend of mine since December. However the feeling increased over time and I have told her that I like her in April. She said she never thought about it. I feel helpless. 
8) My original job offer was 1 year, now my employer have reduced the offer to 7 months till December. I have to find something quickly.

980,Free tutoring for all students during coronavirus (hopefully helps with stress on students!),"Hello everyone! My name is Arhan, I’m 15 years old and from Hong Kong. I’ve started a project called CoVidya (Covid as in the virus and Vidya as in the Sanskrit word for knowledge). I would like to pair the many of us who need extra educational support during these difficult times to the many of us who have some spare time and wouldn’t mind donating just an hour or two per week to help someone in need by sharing a skill. 
 
There are a lot of people on this sub. If you feel like you could benefit from a little bit of help with your classes (maybe you can’t afford an expensive tutor, don’t have online classes, or just need a little academic help during these hard times), I really hope my project helps you. It’s 100% free and you can request to be paired with a teacher of whatever class/subject you need help with. Just sign up on my website, [CoVidya](http://www.appvidya.com/covidya) 

If you happen to have some time and know a thing or two about any class/subject/skill you’re good at, please feel free to help someone in need across the world by signing up to tutor. Just an hour a week could make a difference to someone’s life. It’s completely optional but if you’re taking free classes for a topic you need help with and want to give back, teach a topic you are good at to someone else! Or even if you aren’t signing up to be a student, please consider donating some time to help those affected the most by the pandemic. 

The project has already been featured in over 20 newspapers and there are a bunch of tutors signed up and ready, but we need more students too! So please, if you want to push yourself and study a bit while also getting free help, this is for you!

Once again, to sign up to receive or give classes (or both), use this link: [CoVidya](http://www.appvidya.com/covidya) 

Thank you for your time and consideration, stay safe!"
981,I hate feeling so worthless constantly,"I have no one to confide in so I'm just going to rant here. My self-esteen is currently down in the dumps and I'm hating everything about myself. 


I put my self-worth into my achievements but whenever I achieve something I find another imperfect aspect of myself to beat myself up over. Got straight A's in school? So what, memorising stuff doesn't mean I'm smart. Eating healthier? Doesn't matter because I'm not losing weight. I constantly think that no one will ever love me or take me seriously because I'm chubby (note: I'm not even overweight. I'm at the higher end of a healthy weight but for some reason I can't stop despising the amount of fat I have and see myself as unattractive to the point that it's painful to look at myself. I can't imagine anyone would ever want to look at me, much less see me as attractive.) 


I've also been somewhat of a workaholic before and now that I'm having a break from school, doing nothing feels dreadful. I just don't have the motivation to improve my skills and it's driving me crazy. 


I hate being unproductive. I hate that I put so much of my worth into being thin, being good at art or at school or whatever and when I don't succeed I think I'm the worst person to ever exist. I'm so tired and yet I know I'll ultimately do nothing about this because I'm just too lazy to change."

Every time I have to go socialize I always try to prepared to be anxious then I'm always thinking about it the whole time. And it ruined connections. I feel like I'm just taking myself or life too seriously. Am I trying too hard to be my old self or trying to hard in everything?
983,I think there's something wrong with me,"I would like to preface this by saying I am not asking for anyone to diagnose me, and do not even know if I have any mental health problem. After a discussion with my sister today, I realized that not everyone does the things I do, and am a bit worried. 

Essentially every second of the day, I am daydreaming about random situations. I talk to myself out loud and speak to myself from both sides of the conversation (play multiple people at once). I also often repeat the conversation or what I am saying until I think it is properly worded. I can stop doing this at any time, I do not feel an overwhelming need to repeat or talk to myself, but I do catch myself doing it without realizing I started. 

I also have been told by friends and my sister that I make a quick noise under my breath. Every time I am told I am making the noise, I am daydreaming.

Also, I have no idea if this is connected as well, but I am pretty shy and not very outgoing because I feel like people are judging me. I also am a terrible procrastinator. I'm not kidding, I have pushed the limits and find that I am not even stressed about my procrastination anymore. 

I have no idea if I am over-analyzing the things that I do or if they are all interconnected. Should I seek out help?"

986,Please help - don’t know how to see a new psychiatrist,"My psychiatrist quit unexpectedly in mid March, right as I was leaving college to go home for spring break (my home is also out of state, and i wasn’t able to go back to college due to covid). I’m on my last refill of my antidepressant and I need to find a new psychiatrist here, but I’ve read online that you typically need a referral to see a pyschatrist. 

If I’m already on medication for a mental illness, and I no longer have a practicing psychiatrist, do I need a referral? When I call a place in my home town can I just say that I have been diagnosed and prescribed, I just need a new doctor? 

My parents recently moved and I haven’t seen our old GP in about 3 years (she is also in another state) so I don’t know what to do. I was originally sent to my last psychiatrist by the therapist at my college, so I’m not sure how this whole process actually works."

989,Little Me deserves a break,"I think I've done very well so far. I recognize the things that affect me, those emotions that control me in my worst moments. I know their names now; shame, anxiety, codependency. The three shadows that, in many ways, developed in my childhood because they were my only escapes.

I developed those methods trying to overcome what I didn't understand, what made me feel danger. When I see them that way I understand that they're not my enemies but old methods that at some point ""helped"" me that are no longer effective for my adult heart and brain.

I understand that when I feel danger, fear or loneliness I fall into those methods because they were the only ways I knew that existed to cope and that I put into practice to face those complex emotions since I was a child. When I feel like this Little Me begins to work from my subconscious.

She does it very well, but they are not long-term solutions. In those moments, Big Me, the adult must take control and responsibility and not leave Little Me working hard and alone backstage. Even if she does a good job we know better, Little Me deserves a break.

It's still hard to wrap my head around how childhood wounds get dragged into adulthood. We're taught to dress up these wounds so well..."

992,I think I have had a psychosis,"My uncle just had a psychosis, and my mother was explain what he went through and I realized I have had something similar though not as much as my uncle. 
I was laying in bed and all the sudden I thought that nothing was real, everything was simulated or just projected in my head. I walked to my walls and kicked against them to check if they were real, then I woke my brother up and asked him if he was there. Then I went to bed and started freaking out, and I started seeing angels in my room. Next morning I was freaked out and I didn't talk about anyone because they weren't real or something. My mother asked me how I felt and I said something like: ""You're not here"". Because I genuinely thought she was fake, and she didn't think much of it because I was depressed anyways. The next couple of days were really chaotic, for example: I was playing video games with my friends and I just felt like I was being mind tricked. Their responses just felt like a computer talking to me.
About a week later I realized that I just was confused and acted like nothing happend, but I just realized that my family(mom's and dad's side) have a history with psychosis(?). 
I want to know if I was actually experiencing a psychosis or was just confused. I have not really talked to anyone about it, because I don't even believe myself that it happened, but it did. I have ADD diagnosis and am depressed since 13 years old (now 17 (just turned 17)), this happened when I was 15.
I always feel like I want to run away from life, just like my uncle. But not always, I'm very fluctuating in my thoughts and mood. One day I'll say that I'm depressed, the other I feel great.

Life is such an ephemeral thing. Everything we do is forgotten so quickly like the castles of sand slips into the sea eventually. People forget us like an abandoned building or a dry rose forgotten in an old book. We have had encounter with hundreds of people who unfortunately have not made it to our present. We stayed with them for a period of time and then they vanish into thin air. Just like that. Without any closure. No explanation or closing conversations. Just gone like they never existed in the first place. Well, to keep ourselves sane, we may believe that they served their purposes and went away with it. We may get someone better. We don't know what's stored for us, but what about the damage they left us with? They say, 'time heal all wounds' but I don't think so. Maybe, pain subsides, but it doesn't heal straight away. Certain holes never heal. They're always left open. They start aching with gusts of wind blowing them.


Years pass by, still you're chained in your excruciating past. We can never really know why or where certain things went off to. Why some things didn't work when you gave more than you could. Maybe, that's the beauty of life. Beauty of unknown and unfathomable. There are things which we cannot comprehend because human mind cannot comprehend certain things which are beyond our sphere, wisdom and understanding.

To me, life's excruciating and human existence is burden, but I wish you all the best of everything. Whatever keeps you going, just keep going forward without looking back. You're more stronger than you think and you matter. Please, don't you dare to think of any less about yourself. Trust me, fam. You make this world a better place just by existing."
994,How do I let go of my anger?,"Hi ,

So I am struggling with feeling so angry about something lately that it's starting to really affect my daily life, and I find myself brooding and thinking about it a lot.

Basically, my parents next door neighbours are just awful, selfish people, that's always been a thing. But even during the strictest time in lockdown they had absolutely no respect for it. They took their kids out on day trips every few days, constantly had friends over and went shopping literally every single day. Everyone who flouted lockdown made me angry, I live alone and have not seen my boyfriend for 11 weeks now but it's better than going out there and putting people at risk. 

Well my mum, who is so so clean and only ever went to the supermarket once a week got infected 3 weeks ago. She is now in hospital, as she has been for the last 2 weeks. It's been so unbelievably hard to see her so unwell, to hear of other people on her ward dying and to hear the awful stories from the staff there. 

But when she got unwell those ****s next door had the nerve to ask her to display this dehumanising big sticker on her front door to tell people to stay away. She ran out to people walking through the street to tell them ""that house has covid"", she continued to make so much noise in her garden that mum couldn't sleep, she and her husband gave my little brother dogs abuse after he was allowed out again.

And there they are, still flouting lockdown, having their pals over for BBQs and having lots of other kids in their garden. We're in Scotland so lockdown is still very strict, but they just don't care.

Why is it my mum, who actually cares for others, who stayed clean, who tried her hardest, why is it her lying in that hospital bed and not people like those monsters?! 

It makes me so angry. I just hate the injustice in this world and it is eating me alive.

995,I’m going to dedicate the rest of the year to my mental health,"I think I’ve hit rock bottom. I feel so alone, i feel like i’m losing all of my friends, and I can’t relate to anyone in my family anymore. Last year I got out of a six year toxic relationship, and somehow jumped right into the dating game with bright eyes and high hopes and continuously got my heart broken. 11 months later i’m finally at the point where i don’t even want to try anymore. I feel really hopeless, probably the worst I’ve ever felt and I’ve been struggling with my mental health for 13 years. 

So instead of giving up right now, i’m going to dedicate the next 6 months to improving my mental health. If it doesn’t get better, you guys can guess what my next move is. 

So far, i’m making a list of things i’m going to change that I think will help:
-i’m going back to therapy as soon as my therapist is taking appointments again 
-i’m going to start eating healthier - not a strict diet, just like making better choices but if I crave a frosty i’m gonna get one. 
-i’m going to exercise more, especially taking my dogs on hikes 
-i’m going on a men hiatus
-i’m limiting my pouty time in bed/depression naps. I’ll take a nap when I need it, but no more laying in bed for like 12 hours straight 
-reading more self-help books, watching less of the office reruns 
-meditating 
-keeping my living space clean 
-visit my doctor to try new medications

If anyone has any other additions to my ideas, let me know. And if anyone is doing the same thing and would like some support, let’s chat!"

997,questioning existence,sure you could say I should go to therapy (again) for not really feeling like this life is all real or for not really believing I truly exist but neither does the therapist probably. So where do we go from here? Am I speaking to an audience or just the void
998,Is there a trusted charity involved in improving the mental health crisis in america? (Or anywhere),"In my opinion the BLM movement, while good for people who have been victims of police brutality, ignores the fundamental problems rife in america such as mental health and also poverty. In this case i beleive that the movement sort of unintentionally devalues the other causes of police brutality, deaths by shootings and crimes (poor police training, poor police funding, improper equipment [such as viable methods of ending a suicide by cop non leathally] , poverty etc). 

So is there any trusted charity i can donate to without my money being taken by some African warlord or something?"
999,Is there a mental illness where you just hate yourself or is it from childhood?,"Since I can remember I’ve had a really deep feeling of self disgust and unworthiness. I’ve felt like that since I was a kid, now 27F. Obviously I know that sort of attitude isn’t appreciated by people so I would pretend to “like myself” but really I’m in a constant feeling of just hating myself. I truly, deeply view myself as a bad, gross, loser of a person. Idk if this is a mental illness or maybe some stuff from childhood? I’ve tried different ways to fix this issue but it’s constant and daunting. I believe I make some bad decisions because of the feeling “well I’m a piece of shit anyway so who cares.” Any insight would be useful if you’ve heard of this or experienced it or maybe everyone just feels this way and I’m being over sensitive haha ahh.

The way I talked. The way I moved. What I believed...and how I articulated my thoughts.

It seems like such a common thing (sibling rivalry), but it REALLY affected me.

I'm almost 30 years old now, and I'm pretty sure it's still affecting me.

Many times before, I've tried processing this, forgiving her, talking with her,

meditating, reflecting, moving on, etc.

1002,I finished my first year of uni!,"I submitted my last piece of coursework today! I didn’t think I was going to make it to age 16, let alone make it to adulthood and actually be a functional human being. I’ve had ups and downs over the past academic year, but I made it."
1003,Is there anyone who can just pm me for abit?,Please
1004,Help with thoughts,So I have very bad paranoia and OCD on the compulsive side and my girlfriend of two and a half years does not like when I talk about certain things that involve my exes or other people that I think of in weird ways and rightfully so. I worry about this stuff and when I get these thoughts that I think of other people or my exes or have dreams I worry and feel like I should tell her and I feel like I should tell her everything I think with that stuff and she already has intense self hate and self esteem issues and she does not like hearing that stuff. I do not know what to do because I get the strong urge to tell her what I think even if I know it will upset her. When I was at work I thought of a dream I had like a few months ago I think and thought of telling her even if I had already told her I felt like I should. I do not remember if I told her but I am thinking of it again and it involves one of my exes and so I am worried about it. Does anyone have any advice?
1005,I feel dumber as time goes by...,"I feel like i’ve gotten “dumber” ever since I’ve started taking prozac in 2018. I was a pretty bright kid with good grades (~top 10% of graduating class) in high school, but then college came and i didn’t do so hot in my classes. I don’t really know what happened, but i feel like my cognitive ability has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY, and i don’t know how to get back up. And recently i feel like it’s gotten worse after taking adderall and wellbutrin, but i’m not sure if it’s because of that. I used to be able to focus on my studies for HOURS, but now I can’t even handle reading for one minute. It hurts my head and i feel frustrated with myself because i’m so incompetent and dumb! Any ideas on why am i like this now? Will a visit to the psychologist give me any help? I’ve talked to my primary physician and he couldn’t figure out what was wrong."
1006,I am affraid of the people of a certain minority," So in my country we have a minority of people that are... not very polite.. (I will be trying not to say anything bad about them bc it is not a good time for people to think that you are rascist). This thing started almost a year ago. It was around 10 p.m, I was chatting with a friend at the entrance of his flat when a 'minority' came to us out of nowhere (Keep in mind this guy was around 30) and asked us for a cigarette we said that we are not smokers and we thought that it was done. Not even letting me finish my sentence he got in my face and asked what else we have at us. At first I was really surprised bc this never happened to me, next thing I know he was trying to search my jacket. At that point I made a few steps back, this really angered him and he punched me really hard in the jaw, he kept hitting me after that but other than my jaw I was fine. (My friend was even more scared and I. I know him and he never went into a fight.) After that I started to fear everyone from that minority no matter the age or sex. Fast forward to this day I pretty much forgot about the incident and I thought that my fear was gone oh boy was I wrong. (For the record after that incident I started exercise and I am happy to say that now I am pretty muscular and also I learnt how to fight more or less... and I wanted to mention that this fear was only to this minority, I don't fear anyone as long as he is around my age and not from that minority) This day I was with 3 friends walking and chilling when 3 kids of that minority aproached us. (They were all around 10 or 11 while we are all 16) They aproached us and asked for a lighter (Usual scam, they ask for a lighter and when you give it to them they run away) We said that we aren't smokers and my friends started to make fun of them, everyone was laughing except me.. for some reason I was very scared (Most if not all of them have brown skin and are really dirty) After we passed them while my friends were laughing I was doing my best to hide that I was very scared. I really want to solve this problem somehow and I am open to any advice. I am pretty sure it is all mental, actually I was planning to go to karate lessons this summer altough everything canceled with this pandemic."
1007,“Why do you always have to fuck up everything you touch”,"Both of my parents always say this to me anytime I do anything. I was literally making Mac and cheese for myself and was experimenting with seasoning. My dad’s girlfriend walked in and scared me so I accidentally put way too much in. She took my food and straight dumped it in the trash and told me to “stop trying to do stupid shit like that because you always fuck it up. I can’t wait until you move out.” 

I hate myself. I honestly feel like I can’t do anything without disappointing someone. I want to fucking die."
1008,Someone is changing up reality to my harm and I don't know what to do,"It probably sounds insane, but I have no other explanation at this point. There just is no way to have such an amont of bad luck. Those who know me keep telling me how great it is that I always keep going, no matter what and that all the work and focus will eventually pay off, but it doesn't. And always because the next accident or bad luck is waiting for me. You could call me pessimistic, but everyone would be after all those events. In the end pessimism is just a reflection of ones past.

So now I don't believe in that farytale about chance anymore. It might apply to everyone else, who has natural ups and downs, but this is just not possible to be all by chance. I don't know how it would be possible for someone to change my reality, but it still is whats happening. And it's damn frightening to be at someones mercy who has such a power. I don't know what to do anymore, police wouldn't take me seriously and other people would say something like ""we all have a bad day sometimes"". They all don't understand."
1009,How does the first breath after recovering from depression feels like?,"I have been diagnosed with depression for 2 years now. I have had given up and hoped again. But I wanted to ask is it like one day suddenly you aren't depressed anymore? If it is like that what does it feel like? The first breath without depression, life without depression, how does it feel like? 

Or is it that you never recover? Do u just get used to it? Or do you fall in love with life?

I want to hope and that's why I am asking this, I want to dream, and I want to ask what this day without depression would be like so I can dream it."
1010,Idk who feels like this but how can I hate so much myself but also have a large ego?,I hate a lot of things about myself but at the same time have a large ego.
1011,Help with a persistent and disturbing intrusive thought?,"TW (?): graphic-ish description of a sex-relared intrusive thought

Not sure if this is too specific for this sub as I know intrusive thoughts are an OCD symptom, but I don't have OCD. 

For the last week or so, I've been hounded by a very persistent intrusive thought (?) about genital mutilation. It starts with the thought of it, which makes me very fearful, and then that fear sparks a graphic mental image that I can't shake. It makes me wince and sometimes audibly react, although since this happens so frequently I've learned to control my reaction a bit. This will sometimes happen up to multiple times an hour, or I can forget about it for a few hours but remember in an idle moment (and there are many in quarantine!) and be drawn into a cycle of thinking about it, intentionally trying not to think about it, and then thinking about it again. I'm almost afraid to post this because any follow-up will bring the thought back, but at this point I'm anxious that I'll be hounded by this disturbing image forever. 

It's gotten to the point that walking around my house, I'll notice sharp objects that could cause me harm and I'll get shaky and start picturing mutilation again. I obviously don't have any desire to do this to myself, it's more a fear that this will happen/I'll be assaulted and someone will mutilate me. I also fear that this is some sort of premonition and it's kept me up at night.

If anyone has ideas on how to combat this, please let me know. It's really starting to damage my mental health which was already unstable due to isolation at home/a LDR that's starting to feel neverending bc of covid restrictions/etc."
1012,I don’t want to be labelled,"I’ve struggled with mental health since my late teens. It’s been labelled by professionals but I don’t really feel like I fit into any particular “mental health label” - there are so many - anxiety, depression, PTSD, bipolar, OCD, eating disorders, schizophrenia, body dysmorphia, borderline personality disorder... they are all just labels and I don’t really like to be labelled, every experience is different. Sometimes you can feel like you have a combination of so many &amp; sometimes you feel like you don’t have a mental illness at all, you’re just living the human experience. Sometimes I feel like we are all slightly “mentally ill” at certain points in our lives in our own ways. We just aren’t all labelled. 

I feel like my mental health has taken a lot from me without my permission, it’s taken away connections with friends, family and sometimes particularly painfully, relationships. It’s taken away new experiences, jobs &amp; periods of time that I won’t be able to get back. 

Sometimes I feel like a time traveler, I’ll drop in &amp; out of people’s lives depending on how I’m coping in my own. Sometimes people don’t understand this, they don’t understand the inconsistency. They say, we’re here to help, let’s go for a coffee, have a walk or even just a chat. But sometimes I just can’t, &amp; I just can’t for quite a while. By the time I can again, it can be difficult &amp; embarrassing to explain &amp; reconnect, not knowing if I’ll have to drop out of their lives again in the future. Sometimes people don’t understand and I understand why they don’t understand, but most of those closest to me, particularly a few very special friends, have just been happy to have me in their lives in whatever form that may take. 

While my health has taken a lot from me, it has also given a lot to me as well. I’ve been shown unconditional love, shared stories &amp; understanding by so many people. I’ve got an understanding and new level of empathy for others I never thought I’d be able to have - forging new &amp; deeper connections with so many people. 

I have an uncertainty about the future which can be unsettling, I don’t know if the chemicals in my brain will go rogue again but I will do my damn best to keep them at bay with all the tools I have learned &amp; support I been given - I guess that’s all anyone of us can do, none of us can know what the future will bring. None of us are alone in this, and are all stronger together."
1013,I’m a burden,"It’s my day off today. I’m almost always anxious. My boyfriend tells me that I am too sensitive that I stress him out. (I live with him) that he already has other daily tasks to deal with and he has to worry about me on top of it. Says I’m always attacking him. I don’t mean to it’s just I get anxious really easily about stupid things and I’m insecure. I feel so worthless. He says I make him tired. He doesn’t even want to hang out with me on my day off tbh. He tries but then he gets tired and stressed. I’m nothing but a fucking burden to everyone and sometimes I wonder why I didn’t just kms at 17. But here I am, adding an extra layer of stress to his life. He says he only worries cause he loves me but I’m so hurt. I don’t know why."
1014,Is this a common disorder?,"I can't be alone in the evening/night. And I CAN'T go to sleep alone. When I'm left alone in the evening/night I constantly worry. I feel abandoned, and I'm afraid that people won't come back (either because they decide to leave me or something bad has happened to them) I'm also afraid because no one is there to protect me, what if someone breaks into the house or a fire starts and I haven't noticed. Sometimes I have mental breakdowns because of my feeling of abandoned and anxiety and sometimes I do selfharm, to try to get my thoughts away. I can't go to sleep because when I try I feel left alone and I'm afraid they wont come back."
1015,How can i be happy again?,"Hey. I don’t really know how i’m going to put all of this but here we go. I’m a teenager and I used to have this bestfriend, but I lost her because I did something really really horrible and fucked up, I can’t take it back and I can’t fix it, and if I could take back what I did then I would without any hesitation. When I first started to do it, I didn’t realise the impact it would have when it all ended, and I did what I did so I could see what it was like to be happy. I don’t want to say what I did on here because I’m ashamed of myself and can’t forgive myself. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I will never get her back but I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s been roughly 3 months and every single day I have woke up feeling the same way, like I want to die. I don’t know how to be happy anymore and I’m really losing hope. Someone please help me, I know this might seem small to some peoplw but I feel like my life is ruined because I’ve lost the person I loved most. Please help."
1016,Girlfriend with panic attacks - need advice really bad!,"So this week my gf got panic attacks from the new job in the army and it made her life really hard and from me also as I’m her first ever bf and she suddenly started to realize we’re a long time together and got freaked out from everything.

During those panic attacks that occurred (not consecutively), on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, she started saying a lot of crap about our relationship and what she feels , really hurt me. Now I’ve talked to her mother and she said that it has happened before and even worse and when she’s on a panic attack that’s really bad and she can’t see anything else but the bad, she starts to hurt her loved ones and close ones, not on purpose and she always have apologized when it happened in her past.. 

Now I wanna hear from you guys to hear really what you think about it.. can it be true? Is it BS? Should I forgive her for saying those things from the panic attack ?"
1017,Is it bad to let go the people you love in order to find yourself ?,I’m going to keep this short - I tend to think a lot about how I’m hurting other people and how I also have to be there for people. I care and I love the people around me too much but things have gotten hard for me. I want to just calm down and take a step back from everyone around me. I just don’t know if it’s a good idea.
1018,Sensory Overload,"(before you ask, i will be seeing a psychiatrist for this) all my life i’ve struggled with sensory overload problems. feel overwhelmed very easily, and by things that don’t bother the average person. today i was planning on having a friend come over, which involved my mom picking him up from our local recreation center, taking him to our house, and taking him back afterwards. which in itself, bothers me. i don’t like bringing people around my family and i don’t like troubling people, including my mom. i also had never hung out with him before, so i was already extremely anxious. but i a managed to calm myself down. we picked him up and brought him home, when he got a call that he had to leave. this really bothered me and for some reason and made me go into sensory overload. i have really bad irrational thinking when this happens, i felt like i didn’t want to be his friend, i felt suicidal, i felt like i wanted to run away. i just felt really uncomfortable and upset by this, even though it was just a small inconvenience. does anyone else struggle with this?"
1019,I need help,I don't know how to ask. I don't know how to communicate. I'm dead tired. I can't give anymore.
1020,I think i just had a panic attack?,"Hi guys. I dont know what im doing here honestly. 

I have a lot going on rn. Ive recently been disowned by my abusive parents, I'm in the middle of a child abuse allegation against my ""ex"" parents, I'm fighting with fucking cps to believe my abuse allegations but they refuse to because my fucking parents take any kid they throw at them and are considered ""an asset"" to cps. On top of that im being forced into a diet I reallly goddamn dont want to do, am in the midst of quitting cigarettes, and weed, and coming off from a brief addiction to caffeine. 

I went to the gas station and got my new diet friendly food that ive never tried and got my daughter a drink. Walk in the door, sit down and take a single fucking bite and then my daughter sits her apple juice down on the rolling coffee table, and then shoves the coffee table at the couch. The apple juice falls head first and dumps the entire goddamn thing of apple juice onto the couch. That i just vacuumed. Ive been pretty depressed lately because of all this shit and havent been doing a lot around the house. My fiance kinda lost his shit over it the other day and told me i needed to start doing stuff. So i cleaned up the whole house today and thats what i fucking get. A bottle of juice in my couch. 

Im just. So fucking overloaded. She spilled the juice and i just fucking snapped. I couldn't stop crying, my body got all weird and stingy, i started sweating like a lot. I was like loud ugly crying and half screaming and i couldnt stop. I texted my fiance a bunch of rambling about needing out and he asked if his mom would watch her, so i took her over to her grandmas house still crying and now im home and my food has one single bite out of it and i dont want to eat anymore because i feel sick and i dont know what to do except lay here in bed and think about fucking ending it all so i can just get a goddamn break. 

Ugh. I dont know what i want. Thanks for listening i guess."
1021,Suggestions on how to make it better? TW,"Hey! I'm giving this a **trigger warning** just to be safe.

I'm looking for some ways to make this better for myself. I need a new point of view and I can't come up with one myself. I'm looking for suggestions on how to help myself.

I'm a female in my early 20s, an university student. I'm living in a town I don't particulary like but I moved back here because it seemed like the reasonable and responsible thing to do. I'm going to give you a backstory.

My father was man with many issues. He used to drink and most of the time I were around him, he was in some degree of intoxication. My mother was very loving, but had a lot on her plate with raising me, earning money to sustain us, and caring for my grandparents. I was bullied at school pretty much up until high school. My mental health deteriorated when I were 16. I got diagnosed with ptsd, thought I don't know if I ever really had it. I were in a sexual relationship with a close family friend at 12. My mother found out about it. I remember her being extremely angry with me, *why do you go there, you can't blame it on him, he was drunk and you were sober, you've misused my trust*. We never spoke of it again, but at 16 I were in care for almost a year. The latter part of my teenage years wasn't the easiest either, I didn't have a place to stay at times(never had to sleep rough, though) and also got taken advantage of a lot(how do you define a lot?) At 18 I got my own place, graduated from high school and went on from there.

I'm very ambitious and there hasn't been much personal development happening for me in the last years. I'm stuck, I should be using this time to deal with the \*\*\*\* I've encountered. I've always been really worried about being in university and deserving this chance. I'm not worried per se that I'm not going to make it. But it's been hard and it's going to be that way for a long time unless I manage to deal with some stuff to make it more sustainable.

I don't have access to therapy and some trauma-related things have started to come to the surface. I'm going to have to fix this myself. A lot of my issues are sort of behind a mental wall and I can't reach them. For example, different experiences of unwanted stuff done to me - I can start thinking about a specific guy, but it just merges together with some other experiences. Also, I can't verbally express myself - I start talking like normal, but then I forget the words and my mind just goes blank. The only time things come to me more clearly is when I'm triggered. So I've been thinking if the best way to reach these things would be to trigger myself intentionally and... see where it goes? It sounds harmful and risky and I'd be scared out of my mind. But it might actually work because I could reach the things that bother me, and deal with them in a better way than I could when I were younger?

Is this complitely crazy? How do you deal with things anyway? Sorry this is such a long rant."
1022,Social Anxiety,"Hello people of the internet, I'm a 20 year old guy, live in india, currently studying engineering. I am very mediocre at literally everything i do or try to do, whether it be studies, dating, gaming, sports.

I have terrible anxiety since childhood, but it got noticeable by me when i was 14 when every guy in my school was talking about girls and started dating and stuff, since i didn't have the guts to even talk to anyone (not just girls), i have literally 2 friends till this day and i don't feel like i have a meaningful connection to even them.

I overthink everything i do, in fact I'm overthinking right now that everyone here would judge me.

Social anxiety has ruined my life, i can't do basic tasks without shitting my pants, like getting grocery and stuff, it has affected every aspect of it. For example, i love playing video games but i hate interacting with people online I never do voice chat while playing online games and i think that's very pathetic that the one thing i actually like doing, i can't even enjoy doing and it's not like i don't want to interact with people.

Please tell me what to do, it's ruining my life and career and also my hobbies."
1023,VIRTUAL GRIEF &amp; MORTALITY SPACE: online support group | Wednesdays 7-8:30 pm EST | June 10 - August 5 | Drop-In,"VIRTUAL GRIEF &amp; MORTALITY SPACE: online support group

THIS GROUP IS OPEN TO ANYBODY, ANYWHERE.
THIS GROUP IS FREE.

*You're not obligated to come every week, you can contact me the week-of and I will give you login information and you can just join as you please each week - but please commit to the whole session which will last from 7-8:30 pm EST*

So this was born out of my 'Ask the Good Death Doula' Event last night. It seemed one of the most poignant moments was the moment of silence when I held space for myself and the participants to feel grief: for whatever and whomever they may be grieving in that moment .

I realize something I *CAN* do right now is hold space for people of all communities dialoguing about our grief and mortality; which makes perfect sense, because that's kind of my specialty, and seems to be in great need right now.

I may not understand each individual, and each community's unique experiences, but I understand how to support people through grief and I understand how to hold space - and I understand how to know when *I don't know,* and how to learn.

1024,My anxiety............does anyone else relate?,"I'm a male junior in college, my anxiety started in December and came out of nowhere, it just so happened to start up the week that I quit nicotine, so I blamed all my mental confusion and such on nicotine withdrawal rather than relizing it was anxiety, these are the things I've been experiencing since it's started, do you relate at all??? 

- my life literally doesn't even feel the same as I was before I had anxiety, I never would get caught up in my head or be bombarded with ocd and intrusive thoughts. 

- I keep hoping that one day ill return to myself how I was before all of this!

- My vision seems to not be as good and I have this sort of brain fog/off feeling that I can't quite describe but it's just there and it annoys me.

- I've been way more lazy and just wanting to sleep, kinda like a depressed state to an extent, my parents have made comments saying I have ”a loss of motivation” and I just wanna tell them it's the fucking anxiety and ocd but they won't understand.

- I no longer can smoke pot, I used to be a daily stoner for about a year up until my anxiety started and now since I have this anxiety when I'm high it's really not that enjoyable, does it get better? Will I be able to smoke with my buddies like I used to?!

- I almost feel a loss of emotion to an extent to where I don't ever think I would be able to date or be in a relationship with a girl while I'm going through this because I'm literally so fixated on my thoughts and this anxiety. 

- Hopeless, I feel like it's gonna be like this the rest of my life, and I'm not gonna be able to do my dream job that I'm going to school for, a State Patrol Officer, in my head ill often times ask myself if this anxiety is gonna be with me while I'm trying to land that job and if it's gonna interfere.

-This is all new to me, I never really had bad anxiety or anything early on in my life, it just came on in December and has been lingering ever since.

- I reached out to an anxiety and OCD specialist and I've been working with him on a weekly basis but he just tells me that hes gonna work with me to not run from the thoughts and anxiety but instead just let them be there with you and not get a rise out of you, but doesn't that basically mean I'm going to have these thoughts my whole life?!!! 

- I also get intrusive thoughts about Family, Friends, Pets, and everything, it's completely annoying........

If anyone can relate to any of these things, please shoot me a response and let me know, I'm a 20 year old college kid and I really feel like I'm missing out on some fun times of my life due to this, I really just want my life back so I can get back to enjoying my early twenties😔"
1025,"Anyone having this problem, I don't know how to describe it..?","Hey guys, I don't know if this is the right place to post it, but it's a mental health forum so might as well.

Anyways, I've had this problem for some time now and I feel like I should ask for some advice.
I don't know why, but I keep having these thoughts that go against my will. I mean, I've already suffered from intrusive thoughts in the past, but this is something different (I think).

Let me give a real example. So pretty much I'm a gay male and very proud of the whole LGBT rights movement. For some reason, whenever I see a news story or something LGBT related, there's this voice in my head that keeps saying horrible things like ""disgusting"" or ""mental illness"" or ""crazy"", except I know that it's not how I see it. But for some reason, it feels so real and I keep worrying that I have internalised homophobia or am just lying about being gay. Before I didn't have this problem, but when I was younger, I used to hear these comments being said by others (either at school, family, or from Facebook friends which I've now deleted or Facebook comments on LGBT news articles) and I feel like it unwantedly got ingrained in my head. I also have this fear that someome arojnd me will say that out loud when an LGBT topic pops up.
I don't know, but it drives me crazy...

For another example, I'm pro-choice, but comments such as ""baby killer"" or ""evil"" keep popping up in my head, even though it goes against my will. I think it came up similar to what I said before, but the point is that a thought that goes against my will keeps popping up in me and it feels so real, that I get panicked sometimes. Does anyone know what is going on in me? Thanks"
1026,Helping a friend,"My friend is having a lot of problems that's going in her life and I feel I can't help her because she's from a different country, her father don't treat her well and doesn't talk to her without a specific reason,she didn't get good grades and the only colleges that accepted her are expensive and her father won't pay that much, she's afraid of loosing her boyfriend because she feels he's cold to her sometimes. She's afraid and anxious I told her to tell whatever she's feeling in a record as we couldn't call, and I tried to look for reasons why her father is like that but she didn't know, she's almost 18 and she's so sensitive and she keep telling me she's afraid of loosing everything and her boyfriend. I tried to assure her that everything passes as I've been through something similar, and that the most important person to focus right now is herself. I don't know if I'm doing my best but how can I help more and there's something I do wrong?"
1027,It's taken 73 days...,"... and I've finally snapped.

I'm a 25 year old woman currently living with the parents during a pandemic. I'm (attempting) to finish my Masters by September and literally every aspect of my life, from health to education to relationships to daily actives is uncertain. Every day merges into the next. 

This lack of certainty has led to my brain never switching off, and this evening, while having the usual debate with my dad over something trivial, I snapped and had an actual meltdown. 

I was wondering if there are any practical tips of things I could do to calm myself, or even better, establish some certainty in day to day life, while living in a world of chaos.

I've tried exercise. For example, I walked 20km today around a forrest and exhausted myself. It doesn't appear to have worked.

Any help would be completely fabulous.

Much love xx"
1028,An interesting title,"I'm having a major resurgence of depression. I don't like anything I usually if I do for over an hour. When I'm alone I just become neutral, like I'm waiting for something. My friends are busy a lot and honestly it sucks cause I don't want to be selfish but I need them so badly. I've been having suicidal thoughts, I told my Mother who is a critical support system. I told I wanted to be admitted but we're gonna try to get a deeper evaluation but I can't get an appointment till September. This whole world is falling apart. I support BLM but I'm so fucking tired if hearing about riots and deaths and politics. I empathize too much and all this sadness is draining me. I can't even watch a sad movie without being a lost daze for an hour after I watch it. I get so sucked into the pain of that fake world and I have to tell myself to wake up, it's not real. I just need some friends that understands and who I can talk to. I love my friends now and no one will replace them but idk I just don't want to be like hey give me attention I'm dying. If anyone feels inclined I'd love to talk to you, I just need someone who wants to talk about the real people we are."
1029,I'm confused,"I've always considered myself to be somewhat of an empathetic person, but as of recent I've found myself completely disregarding other peoples feelings and I don't really feel bad for anyone anymore. What's currently happening now would be a prime example of what I'm experiencing. The videos I see of the protests where people are getting mistreated and hurt evoke no feelings whatsoever. I've no political standpoint, I don't carry any prejudice against anyone, I just don't care. I find it entertaining if anything, I enjoy seeing people get hurt nowadays."
1030,I went and got help today,"I finally after 6 months of spiraling down, stressed out at temp jobs. I called out the rest of the day, went to my pcp, and she helped me get help. I almost did a voluntary admit. But crisis decided that i fit best in a group therapy program on zoom for the next 2-3 weeks.
I will be quitting my job effective immediately, and getting better. Ive needed this for so long, and put it off due to feeling like i just didnt need it, wasnt mentally ill enough. 

But today i did it. It was all triggered by a single dose of singulair, and yaknow what? Ill take that one bad medication reaction and thank it for saving my life and making me realize i needed help (there was a new FDA warning about the mental health affects singulair can have with even one dose, which was all i took, and my pcp was not aware, but i told her not to worry and it absolutely isn't her fault, she just wanted to help me breathe better) 

Please get help if you have the means to. Its ok. Its ok to not be ok. I love you. You're wonderful ❤️"
1031,"Just a question, what happens to someone that tried to kill themselves. Are they taken to a place against their will?","Hey there, 

I dont know how to word it better. But let's say someone is suicidal. What do the authorities or mental health professional do that individual? Does the Swat team comes to their house, grabs the individual and place them in a mental health institution? Does that person receive some sort of record whether it's criminal or medical? How long are they kept in this place (if applies)?"
1032,Why I hate therapists,"""You get out of therapy as much as you put in. Because I, the therapist, doesn't want to work. Just give me the money and leave me alone.""

I came to you with harsh conditions. I needed help. I couldn't hide. But you didn't want to work, all 3 of you.

We asked for answers. We wanted to know what the fuck is depression. We wanted to TALK to someone. I wanted a respond. I wanted, for one fucking time in my life, for someone to actually EXPRESS INTEREST in me.

I cannot express how hurting it is to reach out for help and get your blank faces. How was I supposed to talk to you when you didn't talk? Why do I deserve to be punished just because I don't like to lead the sessions, just because I NEED HELP OPENING UP?

Why did you do this? Why did you refuse to help me even though I fucking paid you?"
1033,I'm about to totally lose it and I don't know what to do.,[removed]
1034,Love with depression and self loathing,"I find it very hard to talk about this topic, I simply always dismissed the option of a relationships for myself and just never even dwelled in the thought of ever having one.
In all of my life I never felt anything even close to a crush, not towards guys nor girls.
Sincerely, the problem in a hipotetical relationship it's not the other person, is me, I just simply can't see myself with anyone.
Relationships don't repulse me, is the taught of me in one that makes me sick.
I just can't even fathom the thought of someone even taking an interest in me so I simply remove myself from the equation and I'm doing it so effectively that I simply haven't developed the ability to have feelings.
I don't even know if i have the right to call myself asexual, because I have a strong conviction that my feelings or rather lack of them thereof, have more to do with some deep rooted self-esteem problems and pathological depression.
I am not exactly sure even sure what I am looking forward to, because for once I dont think even if resolved all of my problems i couldn't ever have back the option of being normal but mostly I bet I genuinely am not interested in love, but I am in a time of my life when this kind of lacking side of me is starting to feel increasingly bothersome. 
I am just so tired, tired of not fitting in any box, tired of feeling like people expect something of me and tired of people thinking that I'm feeling bad because I'm missing out...
I already have so many reasons to feel bad about myself, and the notion that I'm not even capable of comprehending what every other human have no trouble feeling just makes me feel even more miserable.
And knowing that I will never be able to comply to even the most basic of physiological duty makes me feel just ten times more useless than I already feel."
1035,22F and Lifelong Struggle with Mental Health,"I'm not quite sure how to start, but I'm looking for advice and emotional support. I'm a 22 year old female and I've struggled with my mental health for most of my life, ranging from severe depression to body dysmorphia and anxiety. I was raised in a very strict religion that some (myself included) would refer to as a cult, which I ended up leaving when I went away to college a few years ago. My first year away at college was a very difficult period in my life since most of my friends and family (other than my parents and sister) severed all ties with me after I left the religion and made it publicly known that I was pursuing higher education. One of my closest friends in the religion also abruptly died shortly before I went away to school, and I didn't even realize that what I was experiencing was grief. I had also been homeschooled from 6th grade onward so it was difficult to transition back into a brick and mortar school. As a result, I turned to drugs and alcohol and didn't really give much thought to my future because in the back of my mind I always thought that if things became too much I could just kill myself. As time passed at school and I sought professional help, I slowly began to learn how to cope with these feelings. I also made close friends and met someone who I'm still currently in a relationship with. However, there were still numerous moments where I would completely break down and think about all of the experiences I missed out on as a child. I also still harbored deep hatred toward myself, and tried to commit suicide during my junior year abroad after experiencing a panic attack in a museum.

Flash forward to 2020 and I'm a year out of college living with my boyfriend in a major city with no friends or family here whatsoever. We moved here last summer because he was starting grad school here, and I had also gotten a job. Unfortunately I have been furloughed from my job since the end of March, and am expecting to go back soon but my boss has unfortunately been less transparent on that as I'd like. As a result, I've been experiencing regular panic attacks about the prospect of permanently losing my job. The fact that I still haven't made any friends since moving here also makes the days feel very lonely, and I can't help but feel myself regressing back into the person I was when I first went away to college. I binge drink every day and keep telling myself that if I lose my job I can always just commit suicide. I also don't feel very connected to my boyfriend anymore, even though we live together and have been in a relationship for four years. I fantasize about what it would feel like to be pursued by other men and women and sometimes wish I had the courage to just go out and find someone else to f\*ck and talk about life with. Most of all I've just been deeply deeply upset and lonely, and keep ruminating on moments in my life when I've been abandoned by those closest to me. I can honestly say that I don't even want to be on this earth anymore, and the social conditions in America only make me want to leave it even more. I'm disgusted by myself and everyone around me and don't know what to do.

Sorry for the rant -- if you've bothered reading this far and have any advice or support I'd appreciate it."
1036,Why do sometimes I experience moments when I can't read well or even finish a sentence?,"I am a good student, I love to read, have good vocabulary, I am average in terms of how smart I am I guess. However, starting last year I began to have moments where my mind can't focus on certain words and when I speak it comes out like nonsense. It's like my mind is not working right. It was only like this a couple a times for like a week last year. However, it kind of happened today, but much less intense. I make sense when I talk, but I have trouble reading. Even sentences like ""here we can help"", I struggle with reading and making sense of them. It's really frustrating. I don't know why this is happening. I can't go see a doctor or anything because I can't afford it. Just wondering if anyone had some insight into what it could be. Also, i'm 22, female."
1037,Does anybody have experience of weaning off antidepressants?,"I'm potentially going to wean off my meds (Sertraline) soon, after I speak to my doctor next - who knows when that will be with the lockdown.

It's common knowledge that going cold turkey off meds is a big no-no. But I can't find much online on what it's like to slowly wean off antidepressants, so was wondering if the people here had gone through this and how they felt?

My depression is not 'cured', I mainly want to come off meds because a) they cause me lots of side effects, b) they stop me taking other things like Omega 3 tablets and CBD oil - for some reason the interaction makes me feel more depressed, and C) I don't think they've helped me much tbh and I'm sick of taking them.

Did your mood change at all coming off? Good? Bad? Or was there just physical side effects like the 'brain zaps' I've read about? Any advice for coming off?"
1038,Needed to get some things off my chest.,"I've never made a post like this, so I am not really sure where to begin, or if this is even the right place. I'm 30-something male who has battled moderate depression most of my life (recently put on medication), in tandem with self confidence and social anxiety issues. I have grown out of the latter two issues with age, but a new one has presented itself. Over the past 5-6 years I have had ever increasing issues with anger management. I am quick to become emotional/defensive/irrational at things that are beyond my control. It honestly feels as though I have a literal ball of anger and vitriol building inside of my chest that is only getting bigger as the years pass. I have tried almost every outlet I can think of to relieve some of this tension (athletics/boxing/new and old hobbies/etc.) but to no avail. I dont understand why this is happening to me, I dont even understand where all of this anger and frustration comes from. I have a great life and it almost feels like my brain trying to sabotage itself. 

TBH: I dont know what I am hoping for by writing this out. It kind of made me feel better venting on a throw away account, I guess?, and I dont really feel like anyone else I have talked to about this understands. I know this is not normal and I know I need to talk to a professional about it. However, if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, I would love to hear them. This problem is only getting worse as I age.

Lastly, (just incase) theres no risk of self harm or harm to others. The worst I do is lash out at others online, and I'd really like to stop doing that and be a decent human being again. Thanks for reading if you made it this far."
1039,I’m out of options.,"i’ve done therapy for years and i’ve only gotten worse, i’ve been to a mental hospital and only gotten worse, i’ve been but on meds and only gotten worse, i’ve self harmed and only gotten worse, i’ve talked to family and only gotten worse. I’m 13f and i feel like my mind will take over and i won’t live til my birthday in 1.5 months. i feel like i ruin everything, and people always say to cherish life and it will get better but i’ve always felt like shit and i
there’s nothing to cherish, i do everything wrong. i’ve gained 50 pounds in the last year, am most likely getting held back, and my parents might have to build a new room if i move in from my toxic mom’s house (my parents are divorced) and i’ve tried homeschooling but i just got worse as well. i don’t want help but i feel like i need it, because the only experiences i’ve gotten with help is that it makes me worse. i just want to know what i can do before my mind takes over. (oh yeah and i’m lesbian and i’ve only dated one person in my whole life so i feel like i’m never going to find anyone)"
1040,I'm done.,"I'm 26M. I've been single for 5 years and that's definitely not changing anytime soon. 
Any chance I get to further myself, I fuck up. 

Women (well out of my league give me a shot and I self-sabotage to the max, so I don't  even get to the point of rejection (as I do that myself).

I have no friends that I can depend on (I just have my Mom and Brother), I'm a college drop out (supposed to be starting afresh in September,  but we'll see how this pandemic pans out). 

All I have going for me is that I'm fit and healthy (obsessively so). 

During this pandemic, I've really tried to take my mind outside myself. 

I've tried learning languages, experimenting with art, cooking and I've read til I can't physically keep my eyes open. 

But what's the use if I can't communicate with people? 

I'm not thriving. I'm keeping myself occupied, until what?

 What's the point? 

The only reason I'm keeping myself alive, is because I know for a fact my Mom will not be too far behind me."

1042,"I feel like I am stuck in a negative thought loop, please help me.","Recently, I have a friendship which went bad, because this friend/roommate insulted me many times, which made me hate him inside my mind.

Initially I just let go because I can deal with insults and I did respond to those insults to show my attitude and I didn't want to make it awkward since I am still living there, though I quickly found a new place and moved away.

However, after I moved out of the house, I start to feel really bad about this whole experience, I feel like I really hate this person greatly. So great that I resent this person and I want him out of my life.

However, here is where the problem is...

Before I left the house, some talk happened between me and him, where he commented on my weight and said something similar to I should lose weight, he also bragged about how he is learning skills and getting confident about finding a new job.

These comments triggered me, I admit I probably got sensitive, I've always wanted to lose weight and start learning skills, but I procrastinated and didn't actually start. I thought to myself I'd start after I move to the new place.

However, I am not stuck in a negative thought loop, I give myself this thought: ""If I start losing weight, learning new skills, doesn't it mean I got influenced by this person I hate? But I resent him very much, I want him out of my life, if I am influenced by him, then I can't get him out of my life...""

So, now I feel real bad because I feel like I am stuck, if I do what I wanted to do, I get worried that I am influenced by him, if I don't do what I wanted to do, I can't improve my life...

I see from outsiders' perspective, this all sounds a bit crazy, I don't know why I am stuck in this thought pattern...I am also afraid of seeking professional help, because I didn't seek help before, so I feel if I seek help, then I am again influenced by him.

It's a very shitty experience, I feel maybe I am trying to erase things that has happened, however, due to my resentment I am experiencing this feeling.

I just feel so bad, I wanted to lose weight and learn skills, it's all a part of my plan, why does this person has to say things to bother me like this, I've always respected him and tolerated the insults, I was finally going to kick him out of my life, and he says those things."

1044,Am I mentally ill or are these feelings normal,"Hey I'm a 21yr male who has been dealing with social anxiety for pretty much my whole life, on top of me avoiding large events or social gatherings, It has caused me to have self esteem issues as well. I'm black and has never told anybody about all these feelings, not that I have any friends to vent to anyway , but I should at least have my family right? Unfortunately being black and mentally ill is taboo, or at least it feels that way, Every day feels like a emotional rollercoaster and its tiring, life isn't perfect but I just want to be content with the things I do have, and feel more comfortable in my own skin.    

Ps If anybody has felt the same way would love some feedback, I'm new to this so it doesn't have to be advice just want to vent."
1045,I am not real,"I will turn thirty years old in a few months and even that feels alien to me.  I have always felt aged despite not having spent the years alive to justify it...

In the three decades I have been alive I feel like I have never become a fully realized person... If you compared me to the average person, I would appear to be a 2-D cardboard cutout lacking substance and definition.  People have likes/dislikes, passions, hopes, desires and feelings. I feel things and I appreciate things but my feelings are stunted and shallow, like they too are not fully realized.

In those thirty years, I have maintained no relationships with people outside of my family and only one consistent albeit emotionally awkward connection with one of my parents.  Since April 3rd of this year, outside of work, I have only seen and spoken to two people.  I do not have game nights, lake trips, super bowl parties, Christmas or Thanksgiving celebrations. I do not have friends that I visit or text or talk to or video call.  I work to generate an income and come back to a home where I keep myself alive and occupied until it’s time to go to work to keep the cycle going.  I don’t feel bad about it most of the time but I think I am numb and almost watching my life from afar. The only intense emotions I seem to feel are negative.  I can feel intense fear, intense anger and while few and fleeting intense sadness. I do not feel joy, happiness, contentment or excitement. I do feel love and empathy and I can laugh and I have a cherished dog who has been by my side for almost a decade. 

I have a very difficult time making decisions, surviving social situations, expressing wants/needs/feelings and most of the time I do not know why... I do not have hobbies, interests, passions or dreams. I feel half-human  and unresolved.  As I turn thirty, I wonder why I am here.  Life is hard and hostilely textured; for me it is very rarely and never consistently peaceful much less enjoyable.  I have these fleeting memories from childhood where I remember feeling still... The last time I can remember I smelled chlorine, I felt the heat radiating off the living room window and I felt quiet inside, contented.  I would think you attain this by meeting your needs...shelter, food, and general safety but I have never been able to recreate that sense of peace or comfort.  How does one feel so little and yet remain so discontented and uncomfortable? 

I don’t know who I am, if I am or why I need to be here. I have one person and one canine to look out for in this world and when they are gone I don’t think there will be anything left for me.  I feel like I am running out a clock by making sure the remainder of their lives are not subjected to undue negativity or hurt. When that time is up, I think mine will be too."
1046,"I have social anxiety, am shy, quiet, and an introvert and don't know what to do","I have social anxiety, general anxiety, am shy, quiet, and an introvert, and no matter what I do, I can't seem to improve. I have tried taking professional speech classes at my university, and I've even taken AP French in highschool ( where I've had to give daily speeches in French). But no matter what I do, I still get very anxious before a presentation or speech to the point I'm unable to sleep or eat. My general anxiety is something I've come to manage, but not my social anxiety. Whenever I do something out of my comfort zone, I feel so anxious for hours that I can't concentrate on anything else. I've tried breathing exercises and the techniques my therapist gave me, but nothing seems to help. It doesn't help that I have a naturally quiet voice and that I'm very shy. People( teachers and my family) are also always telling me that my quietness is annoying. I've never gotten bullied, because to most people, I don't even exist. 

I've always heard that being an introvert is different than being shy or having social anxiety, so it feels worse when you have all three of them."
1047,Alone,"I've been trying to avoid this feeling for a long time but, I'm alone. My only friend is my boyfriend and I'm ruining that too. I just want to bawl because I go through the days numb yet hurting. But poor me, right lol. We all have it rough"
1048,Need to find a direction,"I changed jobs around late October last year, I knew it was a bad idea but I did it anyway. I was sadly right, I despise my job and it is eating away at my sanity. I took the job thinking maybe I could do it, it had decent health insurance, but I'm not the right person to be a corrections officer. I do the job to the best of my ability and make sure everyone is always safe including our clients within the work release facility. 

I have put out over 40 applications and not so much as one interview, which is quite disheartening. 

To add to all of this I have been home for nearly two weeks because I was sick. My first covid 19 test was inconclusive, I'm awaiting the results of the second test. Being home has only reinforced my desire to never go back, while my anxiety and depression have gone through the roof. 

Part of me wants to say sod it and just tell them I want go back, I know it will be a huge relief. However, I can't risk my family's wellbeing. I have always done and sacrificed anything to make sure they were never at risk from losing a roof over their head or being hungry. 

I feel very lost and mixing that with my major depressive disorder and anxiety is making it impossible to think clearly."
1049,Confused about something currently and need some insight,"So something that I deal with, some days worse than others, is a really weird mental ""black out"" if I had to describe it. I still can function normally and I'm not zoning out I'm still paying attention, but when it happens, if I'm thinking to myself, reading, talking, listening to someone talk, etc. I lose all understanding of what is being said or read.

It's like if you were in a conversation with someone and they immediately switched to a foreign language and continued like they hadn't.

For background, I have depression, haven't had any major head injuries, and have had an MRI that showed nothing. This happens multiple times a day for about a minute at a time, sometime longer.

I've mentioned it to doctors before, hence the MRI, but they didn't find anything. So I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone else has had this happen before?"
1050,Ive been on hold on the phone for unemployment for over 10 hours.,"Ive been on hold for over 10 hours, I need help I am starting to go crazy I dont feel like a human anymore.

1051,Benzo for Sleep,"For anyone that takes a benzo before bed, does it ever just not work for you on particularly anxious nights? Last night I took mine at 11:30, and fell asleep at 4 or later. I got 2 hours of sleep, so today has been miserable, especially with the added anxiety and fear of it happening again.. Whenever I have a bad night I'm just so overtaken by anxiety that it's all I think about all day. It's horrible!"

We have a variety of positions available (artists, marketers, editors, writers, web designers and outreach). I’m not sure how reddit works because I don’t use it that often, but if you’re interested then let me know!"
1053,Mental Health Decline.,"I've been depressed for quite some time now. Growing up with an emotionally abusive mother took it's toll on me throughout my adolescence and adult life. 

Lately I have been even more depressed than usual considering the state of the world. Both of my parents were affected and almost died from COVID-19 and now the civil unrest around the world are really taking its toll on me. Going to a local protest and being teargassed and shot with rubber bullets was pretty traumatic as well. I hate to see others across the U.S getting brutalized by the police and having their constitutional rights being violated really breaks me down. I hate seeing our black brothers and sisters being discriminated against and brutalized, I hate hearing pro-trump supporters or anti-BLM being racist and ignorant still, I hate how our President is handling his whole presidency, and I hate that I feel hopeless and am worried that nothing will or in a sense, everything will change. Nothing is going to be the same after this.  Our children, our future are going to face the repercussions.

I quit my job a couple days ago due to my mental health and I haven't been eating and sleeping A LOT, I barely want to get out of bed, let alone my room. My family is really worried about me and cry when they see me.

I hope others are being stronger than I am and do not feel the same way I do but I know that I am not alone in feeling this way and there are many others out there suffering in silence. I cannot even begin to imagine what the black community is feeling. I do not know what to do anymore. I really need some help. Where and how can I find it?"
1054,Being alive is hard,"I’ve been struggling to manage my mental illnesses since I was a teenager—I’m now in my late 20s. Between depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and possibly ADHD, I feel very tired. I am tired. This year has been especially hard. And I don’t just mean 2020 because we all know how hard these last six months have been for everyone, but I mean my last 365 days. My husband and I separated after being together for ten years. I had two failed relationships following. 

I don’t really feel like I have anyone in my life to talk to about how I feel. And I certainly don’t have the ability to seek professional help. Between pandemics and living in the US as a working poor “essential employee” means I don’t have access to healthcare. I don’t want to live, but I’m not going to kill myself. I explained it best to someone by saying this: “Like am I really going to do ‘the thing’ ? No but being alive right now is too hard for me mentally and I’d rather be absolute nothingness in a cosmic void but instead I’m a lump of flesh that’s piloted by an electric pile of meat”

Sometimes I wonder how long I have to fight until things get better. Not just for me, but for the many people who are also in a similar position. I’m tired of being a lump of flesh piloted by an electric pile of meat."
1055,Should I admit myself?,"I keep losing time. Waking up, blacking up, not knowing where I am, posting about wanting to hurt others, myself. I feel so off. I’ve been in the ward before, it hasn’t helped much, but I feel like I might do something bad. Maybe this new place can help."
1056,Prozac and Hydroxyzine,"I take 20mg of Prozac daily. I’m having a particularly anxious evening, would it be okay to take Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) to calm me down and put me to sleep even when taking Prozac?"
1057,I feel like nothing will get better for me,"For years, I’ve been around the wrong people, friends and lovers alike. I’m a really giving person, and always wanting to be there for others no matter what, I would push the fact that they were toxic because I wanted something that everybody had, friends and somebody to start a family with because I always wanted kids and always wanted to just settle down. Had an abusive ex who caused me to miscarry physically. Immediately after that, came across “Leeches” who saw me as a target because of how trusting I was and such, one girl even pimped me out because “Oh, we can do this and this and get tattoos.” My own mom said that I’m the type who’d follow somebody off the cliff to make them happy-type. And when I got raped in August the girl pimping me out, her only advice was to “Move on and get over it.” and every time I’d question her motives, she’d manipulate and make me question myself, I feel so alone and lost trust for anybody after the leeches. New relationship happens, and he’s the sweetest guy there is. He knows everything about my past, that I have abandonment issues, depression, anxiety, a rape victim/survivor who is struggling mentally.

I’m scared, I’m scared that things will never get better for me. I’ve been pretty suicidal lately, I feel as if even if I tell others, it won’t matter because of everything happening lately. Because of the rape, I’ve been relying on sex to cope mentally. Though lately, boyfriend has been rejecting me (My ex would always act like something is sexually wrong with me and a lot of things make me self-conscious.) I know there is something medically happening bacterial-wise down there and I’m getting it fixed soon. I’m always trying to stop and tell myself “No, he’s not rejecting you because he’s tired of you.” “He’s not at his friend’s because he wants to get away from you.”

I was in special ed class, a little slow with a case of being born hard of hearing. People think I’m just not responding to them but I’m internally processing what they said. I panic when told “No, let’s go through the math.” Because I was always bad at math because again, special ed classes, but I always feel embarrassed because all I’ve known, is being humiliated and treated as if I’m a burden by other people. My boyfriend is leaving out of the state soon, since we live together, I’m not even sure if I feel safe with myself. I even feel like a burden to my boyfriend when I know it isn’t what he feels about me but it’s torture. 
I just want to be able to start a family with my boyfriend (We’re trying) and to just have a new start, but it feels like it’ll never happen, not with everything shitty going on along with having to see my rapist again in Trial during everything.

I just wanted to write this out and get it out like a journal, but with sharing it to the world. 

I’m so emotionally and mentally exhausted, all I feel like I can do is just be silent and let things happen in my life.

I’m tired of feeling like a burden to everybody, had to leave my 7 year job because it just got worse there.

I really don’t know what more to do for myself."
1058,any advice for getting out of a negative mindset?,
1059,I imagine celebrities watching me,.
1060,I imagine celebrities bullying me,.
1061,I can’t really think of a title for this,"A couple years ago a new girl moved to my school and I bullied her and made racist jokes to her just because she enjoyed a certain brand of clothing. She ignored the bullying and then I escalated it to a fight she didn’t want or ask for. I knew fully she won but I never admitted it and I told everyone I knew that I won, due to me being more popular at the time most people agreed I won. A couple year passed and she began doing drugs, smoking, drinking and driving. She began getting more popular and ended up hanging around with the same group of friends as me and we made up. I apologised and we were on good terms, so good that we would joke about it. And fast forward to about 5 months ago she posted on Instagram that she didn’t want to live and he talked to me about it the next day at school. She had a tough relationship with her mom and when she went to visit her dad who lives in India it was a terrible time. A couple days later she got into a street fight and told me after how it was my fault that she was the way he is, I don’t disagree with her.

Later she posted the same thing saying she didn’t want to live, but I didn’t do anything I saw it but didn’t talk to her. My reason was “she probably has a ton of people giving her support right now.”. And the same things happened again a week ago but now it was a picture of her holding a knife to her wrist. I messaged my friend asking if she saw it too and I asked her if she messaged her. After this I messaged her myself asking if she was alright she said yes. I’ve only just the last few days realised how much of a evil person I am. The reason I didn’t message wasn’t because “she had too much support” but rather I just didn’t want to because it made me uncomfortable. The reason I even said I’d give her support in the first place wasn’t because it’s what I should’ve done after causing this but rather “if I didn’t do it she would have called me out for it, and maybe even start another fight. One I didn’t want”. I asked my friend first is she had seen or messaged her hoping that she would say “yeah I did message her” so I wouldn’t have to. I made the mess but I try my best not to clean it up myself and have others do the work.

1062,I don’t know what to title this,"A couple years ago a new girl moved to my school and I bullied her and made racist jokes to her just because she enjoyed flexing on twitter. She ignored the bullying and then I escalated it to a fight she didn’t want or ask for. I knew fully she won but I never admitted it and I told everyone I knew that I won, due to me being more popular at the time most people agreed I won. A couple year passed and she began doing drugs, smoking, drinking and driving. She began getting more popular and ended up hanging around with the same group of friends as me and we made up. I apologised and we were on good terms, so good that we would joke about it. And fast forward to about 5 months ago she posted on Instagram that she didn’t want to live and he talked to me about it the next day at school. She had a tough relationship with her mom and when she went to visit her dad who lives in India it was a terrible time. A couple days later she got into a street fight and told me after how it was my fault that she was the way he is, I don’t disagree with her.

1063,"Dog owners that don’t properly take care of their pets, but refuse to get rid of them, is there a mental disorder for this?","I feel there are people I know that have pets and are deeply attached, but do not take care of them like they should. Whether it be keeping them in a crate or alone for 14+ hours a day, ignoring serious health issues, or just refusing to groom or train in general. 

Regardless of the pets suffering, they still refuse to re-home it. 

Is there a mental disorder out there for this?"

1065,"When I became depressed three years ago I started to become a much more bitter, irritable, and, honestly, a bit of a nightmare, but, since I've started getting better, its not going away... Help?","Basically the title. I was diagnosed with severe depressions and numerous anxiety disorders on top of minor OCD about three years ago (I also have ADHD, but that was diagnosed well before that), and around that time, I, and some of the people around me, realized that my personality changed quite a bit pretty much instantly in the sense that I was always very irritable, very bitter, and would snap at everything. I didn't have the best temper before, but it was nothing like this. My counsellor and my doctor both believed that it probably had to do either with mental illnesses themselves or the medication I was on, but as I have been getting significantly better, the irritability and nightmarness isn't going away AT ALL, if anything, it's getting worse. I am currently titrating off one of my two antidepressants, but I decided to nitrate off BECAUSE I was feeling so much better and the irritability was persisting/increasing even before I started titrating down. I've worked through numerous anger management programs and I've been doing mindfulness meditations for the last like 6 months as well. Any advice or info that may help me out here?"
1066,My friends don’t care anymore,My friends have no interest in me. My friends were in a room on houseparty for hours and never even mentioned it to me. They leave me on delivered or on read for hours. My boyfriend even seems completely disinterested. I can’t tell if it’s just me or if they really do hate me. I annoy everyone in my life.
1067,I get triggered by the slightest bit of criticism. Am I a snowflake or is there something wrong with me?,"I get on with my life trying to be one of the good guys, be nice to people, respectful etc etc.

I recently noticed that I can't decide if I'm trying to be a good person, or that I'm simply confrontation adverse.

I had an intense upbringing and had it drilled into me not to cause trouble.

Even on the Internet, my heart rate elevates and I feel like I'm having a mild anxiety attack when someone criticises me. It got to a point where I felt gaslit on several forums. I don't think I'm trying to be incendiary but it definitely led to me feeling like I'm being harshly judged.

I try to make light of everything in real life and I don't know if it's a mask to hide what I'm really feeling deep down.

I don't have anyone else to measure my emotional reactivity with. My sister used to call me short fused. I don't smash things up but I think it shows in my face or something. Im not one to voice my frustrations externally.

I was bullied as a kid and when I feel like I'm going to deal with confrontation, I feel like I'm clamming up on the inside and feel like crying. It's compounding my feeling like a wuss.

I feel like I've reached the point where I'm scared to voice my opinion, even anonymously on the Internet, in feae of negative reactions. 

Tl;dr I don't know if my feelings are normal, or if I'm emotionally weak or overreact."
1068,I think Im mentally ill,"I think I have a mental illness. I do not know. I never have sought for help and never told anyone about this. Recently, I get more frequent panic attacks. I'm also worried that I'm having extreme mood swings. I tried searching for bipolar disorder and Im not sure since bipolar is long term mood swing and mine is different. 

The thing that made me think my mood swings aren't normal is when I feel down, it's extreme. It isn't just feeling sad anymore and I get suicidal thoughts. I also started to cut myself. Right now im not in ""the lows"" and not having suicidal thoughts. It's weird.

My sleep pattern is completely fucked up too. I sleep on the day and am awake ALL NIGHT. This has been going on for weeks. I can not stay too for longer than 6-7 hours of sleep. It's driving me mad. As much as I like to sleep, I can not have peace. My head hurts when I try to, so I just get up and tire myself up.

My phone is my distraction. I think it keeps me from ""the lows"" (I call it that now). I also started to not want to talk to anybody nor have any contact. I became more irritable. Is it weird that a while ago I started panicking after killing a cockroach? Fuck this sounds like some crazy shit. Lol I PANICKED OVER A COCKROACH wtf

Idk if they are panic attacks but what's for sure is IM NOT CALM

I have also avoided to watch some movies when people start arguing or shouting. It was last week when it started. It never happened before but suddenly a memory started to resurface and made me panic AGAIN. I cried non-stop for minutes and was not able to calm down. ended up not finishing what I was watching. I tried watching a different movie and when people start shouting at each other, the same uneasy feeling comes again. It makes me extremely uncomfortable. 

Im not taking this seriously. Im still young. Im just 15. This could be wrong. I might just be faking. But im worried that if im alone when I have to move for school I might hurt or kill myself. It's like im a different person when im at ""the lows"" and when stable."
1069,Can this be a sign of health anxiety ?,I'm constantly scared about illnesses. It's all I can think about all day and I'm constantly scared about it. I'll do whatever I can to not contract any illeness. I get scared from any sign of an illness as and constantly convince myself I have something

1073,Alone again,"Because of concerns due to the Covid pandemic I started talking again with my ex, which I deeply love and its mutual, everything was going perfectly, now we live in different countries but I was seriously thinking about saving money to go meet her and be with her.
Turns out that before we started talking again she was having something with someone and that now that we started talking again she was very undecisive and overwhelmed. She told me that she really liked this guy but know that I was back in her head it was very complicated. 
I love her, I am not a very popular or social person, have no friend besides my best friend that is back in my home country,  I would love to be with her more than anything but I want her to be happy so I told her to go with him as I am in another country now anyways... I am very happy to see her enjoing someones company again since our broke up was really hard but now I am all alone again and it sucks to be honest."
1074,My Story - TW⚠️,"I have never actually posted anything on reddit and I am pretty anxious about doing so. I originally wrote this with the intention of solely writing about me and my brother’s relationship, but somehow it turned into this really long story about my life. So, if anyone takes the time to read this thank you for listening. There might be some triggering topics in this post so be wary of that if topics of rape/self harm/suicide/drug addiction are triggering to you. 

My brother and I have never had a good relationship. Growing up in a dysfunctional family and with a father that struggled with drug addiction throughout our childhood, one would think that would draw us closer together and allow us to lean on each other for support having dealt with the same traumas. However that is not even close to how the dynamic of our relationship works. My brother growing up kept to himself. He didn’t want to talk about anything going on and understandably so. I know people handle traumas in different ways. But as the younger sister I always looked up to my brother for support, but I never got that. He didn’t want anything to do with me. When I would turn to him for comfort he would get so angry, scream at me to leave him alone. I remember years later after we both were in college and our dad had been sober for several years I confessed to him how much our dad’s addiction had affected me and continues to affect me to this day. I cried to him and he was completely stoic and only said “stop acting so privileged. Many people have it much worse”. Growing up in a household that turned a blind eye to the addiction and abuse we all endured and especially with a brother who claims it has had no effect on him at all made me feel extremely alone. I had no one to turn to. When I got older, in my early teenage years, I hit a very rough patch. My dad had again relapsed and left our family for weeks draining the bank accounts to use for drugs. One day my mom and I drove around our town trying to find him and when we finally did he was in his car with this extremely pale, gaunt woman. It was clear years of drug abuse had taken a toll on her body. My mom followed his car and got out at a stop light to try to talk to him. When she grabbed the door handle, my dad drove off causing my mom to fall hard on the concrete. She quickly got back in the car and continued to follow him and he led us to a crack house on the sketchy side of town. At that point I was hysterically crying. I felt so betrayed and honestly in shock of how my dad was treating his own family. I felt unwanted by my own dad. I begged him to come home and he lied straight to my face saying he’d come back that night. He didn’t come home for weeks. When he finally did it was because he owed some drug dealer money and they had shot at him while he was driving. After this whole ordeal my dad went to a baker-act facility and then stayed at a halfway house for about a month. My mom claimed throughout this time that she would finally divorce my dad so we’d never have to go through this again. But to my surprise he moved back in not even a month later. It seemed like my mom did a complete 180 and now that my dad was home we were expected to treat him like nothing had happened. My dad constantly would demand respect from me. I was so angry at this time. I hated living there and I hated having to see my dad every day. I felt betrayed by my dad, by my mom, and by my brother who completely shut me out. During this time is when I really started to act out. I was 14 years old when I met a group of not so good friends. I started smoking weed, drinking, smoking cigarettes, and becoming sexually active. I would stay out way past curfew and honestly just defied my parents in every sort of way. At the time I didn’t realize why I was acting that way. I don’t think you ever really do when you’re going through it. Only in retrospect do I realize how much my father’s addiction had affected me. I would cut myself every night and I still have scars to this day from years of self mutilation. I hated myself very much and still struggle with self hate even now. On the night I tried vodka for the first time ever, I got black out drunk. At the time I thought I was with reliable friends. But later that night, I came to completely naked on the beach with random people trying to dress me. They took me home and the next day when I checked my Instagram, pictures of me naked on the beach were all over my timeline. A hate account was made about me that posted the picture with a caption that said how much of a disgusting slut I was. A bunch of kids from my high school commented on it agreeing, calling me a whore and a slut. Come to find out later that the guy friend I was with that night took advantage of my state, raped me on the beach, and left me there for random people to find me. And the people who took the photo and posted it were my friends that just so happened to come across me on the beach that night. After this I fell into the darkest depression I had ever experienced before. I cut myself twice as much and would walk home directly after being dropped off at school. I knew everyone was talking about what happened and could hear the whispers of slut being passed around as I walked by. Even this wasn’t the end all for me. The reason I tried to take my life that night was ultimately because of what my dad said to me. I returned home that night after a full day of skipping school and hiding out at the community recreation center. My parents had gotten another call from my school that I had skipped yet again and they were understandably very angry. I understand why they were so mad but they knew what had happened and they weren’t sympathetic at all. They didn’t understand that I couldn’t show my face at that school. I felt so ashamed and hated by everyone. And most of all I hated myself. The argument escalated and my dad told me “you will never amount to anything but a hooker” and that was it. I was defeated and I knew I couldn’t do it any longer. I didn’t know how to kill myself but I tried taking all the pills I could find in my house. I took two whole bottles of melatonin, a bottle of ibuprofen, and I tried to drink bleach but couldn’t make myself drink more than a sip. I laid down in my bed so tired, so exhausted and fell asleep. I woke up abruptly in the middle of the night in complete agony. The amount of pain I was in was incomprehensible. I was vomiting violently everywhere. I just couldn’t keep in it. I felt like I was dying. My parents rushed me to the hospital where I was stabilized. From there a cop hand cuffed me, put me in the back of the patrol car, and transferred me to the same baker act facility my dad had been to so many times before. I stayed there a full week and was diagnosed with a copious amount of mental disorders and put on medicine. When I came back home nothing had changed. My brother still didn’t want anything to do with me. My dad was still expecting the utmost respect and discipline from me and my mom still followed my dads orders like a puppy dog. And I was still just as broken as ever before. I was expected to change though and when I didn’t well... all hell broke loose. Unfortunately, my suicide attempt open my parents to the door of mental health rehabilitation. They put me in and out of psych wards for the next several months, each time a new mental disorder was assigned to me. The third time I was put in they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on probably the worse medicine I have ever been on: abilify. The doctor gave me way too high of a dose to start off on. Keep in mind I am a 90 pound 15 year old at this time being given a high dosage of an anti-psychotic drug. A day after starting the drug I got extremely ill. I had a splitting migraine that lasted for days and was throwing up every half hour or so. They gave me Benadryl to try to calm me down I guess which only made me extremely high as I physically could not fall asleep because of the pain I was in. I remember calling out for my mom in a daze as I sat high as a kite in the common room while everyone else slept. After being discharged from the facility and being on abilify for at least a month, it had completely deteriorated me as a person. I was a shell of my past self and felt like a zombie. I had a hard time concentrating on anything and couldn’t keep up a conversation. When I went to visit my guidance counselor (who was the worst guidance counselor in existence and told me I had screws loose in my head, but that’s a story for another time) at school she asked me if I was on drugs because apparently I had a dead pan stare. I was on the verge of exploding. Every day was a struggle for me and the only time I felt anything at all is when I was drunk with my friends. One specific day I went to the beach with friends and got very drunk. We were hanging out with a man who I’d never met before. He was in his 20s and provided the alcohol. At one point during the day he brought up the idea to get some cocaine. I was extremely drunk and thought this was a good idea. We got the coke and started doing bump after bump. Me and my girl friend then decided we wanted to run away and start a new life in Miami. The older guy agreed to drive us down there. We drove for hours down to Miami drunk and high off our asses and he dropped us off on a corner. My friend said she had a friend down there that could give us a place to stay but when she tried to call him on a pay phone he wouldn’t answer. So two 15 year old girls were stuck in downtown Miami with only bathing suits and cover ups on. We walked miles to Miami Beach and sat outside a restaurant where we met two Argentinian men that sat down with us and talked. Another man joined us and the Argentinian men offered for us to go back to their place to drink and hang out. We said yes. The man who had joined later said he would give all of us a lift there. Right as we were getting dropped off the two Argentinian men were talking in Spanish and the man who drove told them to get the fuck out of the car and that we weren’t going with them. Apparently the two men were planning on getting us really drunk and having sex with us not knowing the other man knew Spanish. For the sake of not making this any more confusing than it already is I’m going to call the man who drove, Tony. Tony took us to his place and let us stay there that night. He probably saved us from being raped or worse that night but unfortunately he wasn’t a saint either. He tried to sleep in the same bed as us and with each passing second I felt more and more uncomfortable. The drunk and high was long worn off by this point and I was regretting every decision we made. I wanted to go home but I didn’t know how. The next day Tony dropped us off back at Miami Beach. We asked him if he could spare some cash for us and he said he would for a kiss. We decided against that and were left at the beach with no money and no idea what we were going to do next. We spent the day at the beach trying not to think about nightfall but as it was growing closer I knew we couldn’t stay here. We went into the lobby of a hotel and I connected to the WiFi on a iPod I had brought with me. I called my mom on some app I had downloaded and to my surprise she was already on her way down to Miami to try to find me. She had called the cops and talked to my friends and figured out where we had gone. My mom picked us up drove us hours back home and immediately to the psych ward where I stayed for a week and from there was sent to a long term behavioral rehabilitation facility. To be very clear, I am not condoning anything that I did. I know how wrong it was. I know I fucked up real bad and there are no excuses. The thing is now looking back I can understand how it had gotten to that point. I wish I could change a lot of things I did in the past. I wish I never got involved with that group of friends. I wish I never got drunk that fateful night on the beach. I wish I never tried to kill myself. I wish I didn’t try to run away so many times. I wish I never did coke and go to Miami. But I was in an environment that left me completely vulnerable to the actions of people around me. As a child I could never escape the cycle of addiction and abuse from my father. I was trapped in a crumbling household that acted like it wasn’t crumbling! That we were perfectly fine. I was the malfunctioning piece to my family and I think instead of finding the root of the problem and fixing it my parents tried to fix the thing that from the outside looking in was broken. But if you looked just past that outside layer, all our wires were frayed. Our family was broken. Our whole family was malfunctioning. I was just the scape goat. And so I spent 2 months in this rehab facility. From the outside, mental health facilities look like a perfect place to send misbehaving children. The website says they have pet therapy! And arts and crafts! The first day in I knew this new environment was going to be hell. We had very strict rules. Single file lines, waking up at 7am and to bed by 8pm. Immediately after waking up we had to sit in the common room completely silent while they handed out medication. This took literal hours for everyone to get their drugs and if you talked or got up when you weren’t supposed to you would get something called “hours”. Hours were a punishment given where you had to sit in a chair for a MINIMUM of 4 hours. You couldn’t speak, you couldn’t sleep. You literally had to sit there for hours doing nothing and many of the times they made you face the chair towards the wall. If you fell asleep the hours wouldn’t count and you’d have to redo them. Hours were a minimum of 4 and depending on the severity of your crime it would go up by 4. So you could get 4 hours, 8, 12, and so on. If you spoke or got up during the time they gave you medication you would get 4 hours. I met with my psychiatrist once a week for a few minutes. I didn’t even know his name. My therapist there was the worst therapist I’ve ever had. He was unsympathetic and didn’t listen to me. He would drag on and on and hardly let me speak. He told me I needed to accept the blame for causing my family so much pain. I already felt so ashamed. I cried nearly every day. The kids in there were very abrasive. If you were violent you’d be transferred to basically the “bad” girls ward where you were placed with other violent girls. I remember one time this girl was mad because this other girl was talking bad about her. The day before the other girl was going to be discharged she took all her belongings out of her dresser (she was her roommate so she was allowed in their room) and pissed all over her stuff. Yes, she urinated on her belongings. When the other girl found out she flipped shit and they got in a physical fight and the whole unit was on lock down meaning we weren’t allowed to leave the common room and go to the gym or cafeteria for days afterward. The girl was transferred to the violent girls ward. This kind of thing happened a lot while I was there. Somehow kids snuck in drugs. People would get away with having sex under the technicians noses. There was a place called the quiet room where if you were acting up they would lock you in there. It was all white with padded walls. I remember kids getting put in there and hearing their screams go on for hours. This wasn’t a healthy place to be is what I’m trying to get across. Also there was no pet therapy like the website said. I felt so hopeless. So alone. I was on the most medication than I ever had been on before. When I finally got out I cannot tell you how depressed I was. I didn’t know how to function anymore. I didn’t have any friends as I completely stopped talking to all my friends from before. I stopped going to school so all I really did was stay home every day doing absolutely nothing. I didn’t go out in public and I didn’t talk to anyone. Finally a few months later I went back to school. At this point I was a sophomore in high school and I was doing really really poorly. I met a group of friends that again weren’t the best influence but I didn’t run away anymore due to fear of being put back in the facility again. I met an older guy through this group of friends. He was 19, drove a car, didn’t have a job but that didn’t matter to me. I thought he was so cool and he liked me which made me feel even more special. We started dating and my parents did not approve of it at all. But what can you do as a parent? They tried getting the cops involved but they couldn’t do anything because of some vague law that allows for that sort of thing. I didn’t realize it then but this man was taking advantage of my vulnerability and age once again. It was a very toxic relationship and extremely emotionally abusive. He strung me along as he cheated on me multiple times. He’d ignore me and manipulate the situation so I would be begging him to forgive me. I felt like I was falling apart but I couldn’t let go of him. I looked to him for validation and if he didn’t give me it then I was nothing. I tried to get out after he cheated once again. But he would text me everyday and tell me how sorry he was how much he loved me and needed me. So I took him back. He ended up getting involved with a girl a year younger than me. He helped her move across country while we were dating and I learned later on that he took her virginity on this trip. I was devastated. It felt like my whole world was falling apart. And so I finally cut him off completely after 6 months of manipulation and abuse. It was so painful at the time. I remember crying every night for weeks. The thing is when you’re in an abusive relationship you feel like you can’t ever get out. You feel like you need them but after a few months I realized just how horrible my life was with him in it. And now looking back I am disgusted with myself for ever getting involved with him. He preyed on my age. He took advantage of me being so much younger than him and so influential at the time. It’s just another thing on my list of things I regret. Junior year was a good year for me. I got out of that relationship and really started focusing on myself. I had been on and off medication during this whole time and I was completely off at the start of junior year. I felt clearer than I ever had before. Not to say medication is a bad thing I know it has helped many people but I was put on so many drugs and they had so many horrible side effects. Abilify made me a zombie and made me gain at least 20 pounds within a few months. I took another that gave me nose bleeds daily and made my vision blurry. Overall my medicine experience has not been a good one and I’ve never seen a positive effect from being on them. So when I went into my junior year I focused solely on school. I went to all my classes and did really well. I got straight As that year and my GPA went up a pretty good amount because of it. I took my SAT and got a decent score and I started thinking about college. I really just made a complete 180 during this time and I’m so glad I did. The problem is my depression and anxiety never truly went away. I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me. They told me I was bipolar then later said I had borderline personality disorder. I know you can’t fully diagnose someone with those things during this age so it wasn’t a for sure thing. I don’t know if I really need a label I guess. I fall into deep depressive episodes a lot and I struggle with anxiety and especially social anxiety every day of my life. I don’t have any self confidence and I question everything I do. I struggle to make friends and I don’t trust people easily. I know I have a problem with basing my self worth on what other people think of me and especially men. I get involved with someone and I get so excited and think I’ll finally find someone that’s going to treat me right and they end up being an asshole or completely ghosting me. I stopped cutting myself junior year too but it is still something I still struggle with to this day. When you spent so many years relying on that to help cope it’s hard to not fall back into that self destructive behavior. And even now I sometimes wish I could just go off the deep end like I did when I was younger. A lot of times I feel like I’m just standing on the edge peering down at the abyss. I wanna just jump off head first. But now I wouldn’t even know how to. My feet won’t move. So I’m stuck in this in between place of not totally off the edge but so close I feel it’s presence weighing me down all the time. I really couldn’t tell you a time I felt totally free. Maybe when I was younger and didn’t understand anything. When I didn’t know how awful humans could be to one another. I remember when I was really young at least 5 years old. I was sleeping in my moms bed. My dad had come home probably from a long night of drinking and drugs and I wanted to go out to the kitchen to get a snack. I snuck out of my moms room and out into the hallway. Everything was dark except the luminescent light of the bathroom breaking the darkness. I walked down the hallway and slipped in front of the bathroom doorway. My dad was standing there doing something over the sink. There was a knife and thick blood dripping from his arm. Only later did I realize I had witnessed my dad cutting himself. My memory gets fuzzy sometimes of that event and I see blood covering the walls like a sick horror movie in my dreams. I know it’s not real but when I think of it it makes me shudder. I am now 20 years old. I have spent 2 years in college jumping around to different majors not really knowing what I want to do. I’m transferring to a new university this fall hoping that will make my college experience better but to be quite honest with you I don’t feel like I belong anywhere. I feel disconnected from the rest of society. Like everyone else is in on the joke and I just never got it. Back to the point before I got way too deep about my life, my brother and I just don’t have a good relationship. I have always wanted to be his friend and I feel like he just shuts me out or doesn’t even like me. Whenever we get into an argument he always has to bring up the fact that I was on medication. He says that I’m fucking crazy and that I need to go back on meds. It makes me feel like no matter what I do I will never escape my past. I will always just be that crazy teenage girl. He told me once that I embarrassed him in high school. My brother is only one grade above me so he was aware of everything when it happened. When I hear him say that it makes me feel even more ashamed of myself. Like all I am is just an embarrassment to him. He never tries to talk to me about anything from our past or anything I went through. He’s a very angry person and isn’t very self aware. I know our childhood trauma has affected him in ways that he will never realize. He was in a relationship with a girl for almost 2 years in which he was verbally and emotionally abusive to her. He decided to break it off but later regretted that decision and begged for her back. When she said no he took to social media to bash her and victimize himself. His explosive anger and total lack of self awareness in certain situations just goes to show the impact our childhood has had on him. I love my brother and I always have. I think that’s my weakness too. I care too much about what he thinks of me and the things he says to me. He’s very condescending and loves to tell me that I’m a disappointment. He says “I know you can act smarter than you do and it’s disappointing that you act that way anyways” over pretty simple mistakes I make. It’s like he expects the people around him to be perfect and when they aren’t he sees them as inferior. I want to have a good relationship with my brother but I have tried for years and to no avail. I think we will never see eye to eye and that to me is so upsetting because there is no one else in the world that has experienced exactly what I have except him. Through out our childhood we both experienced our father leaving and returning, going on drug binge after drug binge, the explosive fights between our parents, the house going into foreclosure. We experienced it all together and yet completely separate. And now we’re here years later and we couldn’t be anymore distant. It’s sad and I don’t think I will ever find a single person who truly understands me. 

Sorry for the very long post. Honestly I could write a book with all my experiences. I just want to be very clear about one thing I am not looking for sympathy or pity. I think sometimes it’s good to get all of this out and I contemplated a lot on whether or not to even post this. If anyone has gone through similar experiences feel free to reach out. This world can be so hard sometimes and so lonely. I hope we can all find our way and maybe there is a reason for all this suffering.

If you have made it this far, again thank you for listening and I hope you have a great night/day. I know everyone on this subreddit is struggling with their own unique adversities and I truly hope everything works out in the best way it can for all of us❤️"
1075,My Story - TW⚠️,"I have never actually posted anything on reddit and I am pretty anxious about doing so. I originally wrote this with the intention of solely writing about me and my brother’s relationship, but somehow it turned into this really long story about my life. So, if anyone takes the time to read this thank you for listening. There might be some triggering topics in this post so be wary of that if topics of rape/self harm/suicide/drug addiction are triggering to you. 

My brother and I have never had a good relationship. Growing up in a dysfunctional family and with a father that struggled with drug addiction throughout our childhood, one would think that would draw us closer together and allow us to lean on each other for support having dealt with the same traumas. However that is not even close to how the dynamic of our relationship works. My brother growing up kept to himself. He didn’t want to talk about anything going on and understandably so. I know people handle traumas in different ways. But as the younger sister I always looked up to my brother for support, but I never got that. He didn’t want anything to do with me. When I would turn to him for comfort he would get so angry, scream at me to leave him alone. I remember years later after we both were in college and our dad had been sober for several years I confessed to him how much our dad’s addiction had affected me and continues to affect me to this day. I cried to him and he was completely stoic and only said “stop acting so privileged. Many people have it much worse”. Growing up in a household that turned a blind eye to the addiction and abuse we all endured and especially with a brother who claims it has had no effect on him at all made me feel extremely alone. I had no one to turn to. When I got older, in my early teenage years, I hit a very rough patch. My dad had again relapsed and left our family for weeks draining the bank accounts to use for drugs. One day my mom and I drove around our town trying to find him and when we finally did he was in his car with this extremely pale, gaunt woman. It was clear years of drug abuse had taken a toll on her body. My mom followed his car and got out at a stop light to try to talk to him. When she grabbed the door handle, my dad drove off causing my mom to fall hard on the concrete. She quickly got back in the car and continued to follow him and he led us to a crack house on the sketchy side of town. At that point I was hysterically crying. I felt so betrayed and honestly in shock of how my dad was treating his own family. I felt unwanted by my own dad. I begged him to come home and he lied straight to my face saying he’d come back that night. He didn’t come home for weeks. When he finally did it was because he owed some drug dealer money and they had shot at him while he was driving. After this whole ordeal my dad went to a baker-act facility and then stayed at a halfway house for about a month. My mom claimed throughout this time that she would finally divorce my dad so we’d never have to go through this again. But to my surprise he moved back in not even a month later. It seemed like my mom did a complete 180 and now that my dad was home we were expected to treat him like nothing had happened. My dad constantly would demand respect from me. I was so angry at this time. I hated living there and I hated having to see my dad every day. I felt betrayed by my dad, by my mom, and by my brother who completely shut me out. During this time is when I really started to act out. I was 14 years old when I met a group of not so good friends. I started smoking weed, drinking, smoking cigarettes, and becoming sexually active. I would stay out way past curfew and honestly just defied my parents in every sort of way. At the time I didn’t realize why I was acting that way. I don’t think you ever really do when you’re going through it. Only in retrospect do I realize how much my father’s addiction had affected me. I would cut myself every night and I still have scars to this day from years of self mutilation. I hated myself very much and still struggle with self hate even now. On the night I tried vodka for the first time ever, I got black out drunk. At the time I thought I was with reliable friends. But later that night, I came to completely naked on the beach with random people trying to dress me. They took me home and the next day when I checked my Instagram, pictures of me naked on the beach were all over my timeline. A hate account was made about me that posted the picture with a caption that said how much of a disgusting slut I was. A bunch of kids from my high school commented on it agreeing, calling me a whore and a slut. Come to find out later that the guy friend I was with that night took advantage of my state, raped me on the beach, and left me there for random people to find me. And the people who took the photo and posted it were my friends that just so happened to come across me on the beach that night. After this I fell into the darkest depression I had ever experienced before. I cut myself twice as much and would walk home directly after being dropped off at school. I knew everyone was talking about what happened and could hear the whispers of slut being passed around as I walked by. Even this wasn’t the end all for me. The reason I tried to take my life that night was ultimately because of what my dad said to me. I returned home that night after a full day of skipping school and hiding out at the community recreation center. My parents had gotten another call from my school that I had skipped yet again and they were understandably very angry. I understand why they were so mad but they knew what had happened and they weren’t sympathetic at all. They didn’t understand that I couldn’t show my face at that school. I felt so ashamed and hated by everyone. And most of all I hated myself. The argument escalated and my dad told me “you will never amount to anything but a hooker” and that was it. I was defeated and I knew I couldn’t do it any longer. I didn’t know how to kill myself but I tried taking all the pills I could find in my house. I took two whole bottles of melatonin, a bottle of ibuprofen, and I tried to drink bleach but couldn’t make myself drink more than a sip. I laid down in my bed so tired, so exhausted and fell asleep. I woke up abruptly in the middle of the night in complete agony. The amount of pain I was in was incomprehensible. I was vomiting violently everywhere. I just couldn’t keep in it. I felt like I was dying. My parents rushed me to the hospital where I was stabilized. From there a cop hand cuffed me, put me in the back of the patrol car, and transferred me to the same baker act facility my dad had been to so many times before. I stayed there a full week and was diagnosed with a copious amount of mental disorders and put on medicine. When I came back home nothing had changed. My brother still didn’t want anything to do with me. My dad was still expecting the utmost respect and discipline from me and my mom still followed my dads orders like a puppy dog. And I was still just as broken as ever before. I was expected to change though and when I didn’t well... all hell broke loose. Unfortunately, my suicide attempt open my parents to the door of mental health rehabilitation. They put me in and out of psych wards for the next several months, each time a new mental disorder was assigned to me. The third time I was put in they diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and put me on probably the worse medicine I have ever been on: abilify. The doctor gave me way too high of a dose to start off on. Keep in mind I am a 90 pound 15 year old at this time being given a high dosage of an anti-psychotic drug. A day after starting the drug I got extremely ill. I had a splitting migraine that lasted for days and was throwing up every half hour or so. They gave me Benadryl to try to calm me down I guess which only made me extremely high as I physically could not fall asleep because of the pain I was in. I remember calling out for my mom in a daze as I sat high as a kite in the common room while everyone else slept. After being discharged from the facility and being on abilify for at least a month, it had completely deteriorated me as a person. I was a shell of my past self and felt like a zombie. I had a hard time concentrating on anything and couldn’t keep up a conversation. When I went to visit my guidance counselor (who was the worst guidance counselor in existence and told me I had screws loose in my head, but that’s a story for another time) at school she asked me if I was on drugs because apparently I had a dead pan stare. I was on the verge of exploding. Every day was a struggle for me and the only time I felt anything at all is when I was drunk with my friends. One specific day I went to the beach with friends and got very drunk. We were hanging out with a man who I’d never met before. He was in his 20s and provided the alcohol. At one point during the day he brought up the idea to get some cocaine. I was extremely drunk and thought this was a good idea. We got the coke and started doing bump after bump. Me and my girl friend then decided we wanted to run away and start a new life in Miami. The older guy agreed to drive us down there. We drove for hours down to Miami drunk and high off our asses and he dropped us off on a corner. My friend said she had a friend down there that could give us a place to stay but when she tried to call him on a pay phone he wouldn’t answer. So two 15 year old girls were stuck in downtown Miami with only bathing suits and cover ups on. We walked miles to Miami Beach and sat outside a restaurant where we met two Argentinian men that sat down with us and talked. Another man joined us and the Argentinian men offered for us to go back to their place to drink and hang out. We said yes. The man who had joined later said he would give all of us a lift there. Right as we were getting dropped off the two Argentinian men were talking in Spanish and the man who drove told them to get the fuck out of the car and that we weren’t going with them. Apparently the two men were planning on getting us really drunk and having sex with us not knowing the other man knew Spanish. For the sake of not making this any more confusing than it already is I’m going to call the man who drove, Tony. Tony took us to his place and let us stay there that night. He probably saved us from being raped or worse that night but unfortunately he wasn’t a saint either. He tried to sleep in the same bed as us and with each passing second I felt more and more uncomfortable. The drunk and high was long worn off by this point and I was regretting every decision we made. I wanted to go home but I didn’t know how. The next day Tony dropped us off back at Miami Beach. We asked him if he could spare some cash for us and he said he would for a kiss. We decided against that and were left at the beach with no money and no idea what we were going to do next. We spent the day at the beach trying not to think about nightfall but as it was growing closer I knew we couldn’t stay here. We went into the lobby of a hotel and I connected to the WiFi on a iPod I had brought with me. I called my mom on some app I had downloaded and to my surprise she was already on her way down to Miami to try to find me. She had called the cops and talked to my friends and figured out where we had gone. My mom picked us up drove us hours back home and immediately to the psych ward where I stayed for a week and from there was sent to a long term behavioral rehabilitation facility. To be very clear, I am not condoning anything that I did. I know how wrong it was. I know I fucked up real bad and there are no excuses. The thing is now looking back I can understand how it had gotten to that point. I wish I could change a lot of things I did in the past. I wish I never got involved with that group of friends. I wish I never got drunk that fateful night on the beach. I wish I never tried to kill myself. I wish I didn’t try to run away so many times. I wish I never did coke and go to Miami. But I was in an environment that left me completely vulnerable to the actions of people around me. As a child I could never escape the cycle of addiction and abuse from my father. I was trapped in a crumbling household that acted like it wasn’t crumbling! That we were perfectly fine. I was the malfunctioning piece to my family and I think instead of finding the root of the problem and fixing it my parents tried to fix the thing that from the outside looking in was broken. But if you looked just past that outside layer, all our wires were frayed. Our family was broken. Our whole family was malfunctioning. I was just the scape goat. And so I spent 2 months in this rehab facility. From the outside, mental health facilities look like a perfect place to send misbehaving children. The website says they have pet therapy! And arts and crafts! The first day in I knew this new environment was going to be hell. We had very strict rules. Single file lines, waking up at 7am and to bed by 8pm. Immediately after waking up we had to sit in the common room completely silent while they handed out medication. This took literal hours for everyone to get their drugs and if you talked or got up when you weren’t supposed to you would get something called “hours”. Hours were a punishment given where you had to sit in a chair for a MINIMUM of 4 hours. You couldn’t speak, you couldn’t sleep. You literally had to sit there for hours doing nothing and many of the times they made you face the chair towards the wall. If you fell asleep the hours wouldn’t count and you’d have to redo them. Hours were a minimum of 4 and depending on the severity of your crime it would go up by 4. So you could get 4 hours, 8, 12, and so on. If you spoke or got up during the time they gave you medication you would get 4 hours. I met with my psychiatrist once a week for a few minutes. I didn’t even know his name. My therapist there was the worst therapist I’ve ever had. He was unsympathetic and didn’t listen to me. He would drag on and on and hardly let me speak. He told me I needed to accept the blame for causing my family so much pain. I already felt so ashamed. I cried nearly every day. The kids in there were very abrasive. If you were violent you’d be transferred to basically the “bad” girls ward where you were placed with other violent girls. I remember one time this girl was mad because this other girl was talking bad about her. The day before the other girl was going to be discharged she took all her belongings out of her dresser (she was her roommate so she was allowed in their room) and pissed all over her stuff. Yes, she urinated on her belongings. When the other girl found out she flipped shit and they got in a physical fight and the whole unit was on lock down meaning we weren’t allowed to leave the common room and go to the gym or cafeteria for days afterward. The girl was transferred to the violent girls ward. This kind of thing happened a lot while I was there. Somehow kids snuck in drugs. People would get away with having sex under the technicians noses. There was a place called the quiet room where if you were acting up they would lock you in there. It was all white with padded walls. I remember kids getting put in there and hearing their screams go on for hours. This wasn’t a healthy place to be is what I’m trying to get across. Also there was no pet therapy like the website said. I felt so hopeless. So alone. I was on the most medication than I ever had been on before. When I finally got out I cannot tell you how depressed I was. I didn’t know how to function anymore. I didn’t have any friends as I completely stopped talking to all my friends from before. I stopped going to school so all I really did was stay home every day doing absolutely nothing. I didn’t go out in public and I didn’t talk to anyone. Finally a few months later I went back to school. At this point I was a sophomore in high school and I was doing really really poorly. I met a group of friends that again weren’t the best influence but I didn’t run away anymore due to fear of being put back in the facility again. I met an older guy through this group of friends. He was 19, drove a car, didn’t have a job but that didn’t matter to me. I thought he was so cool and he liked me which made me feel even more special. We started dating and my parents did not approve of it at all. But what can you do as a parent? They tried getting the cops involved but they couldn’t do anything because of some vague law that allows for that sort of thing. I didn’t realize it then but this man was taking advantage of my vulnerability and age once again. It was a very toxic relationship and extremely emotionally abusive. He strung me along as he cheated on me multiple times. He’d ignore me and manipulate the situation so I would be begging him to forgive me. I felt like I was falling apart but I couldn’t let go of him. I looked to him for validation and if he didn’t give me it then I was nothing. I tried to get out after he cheated once again. But he would text me everyday and tell me how sorry he was how much he loved me and needed me. So I took him back. He ended up getting involved with a girl a year younger than me. He helped her move across country while we were dating and I learned later on that he took her virginity on this trip. I was devastated. It felt like my whole world was falling apart. And so I finally cut him off completely after 6 months of manipulation and abuse. It was so painful at the time. I remember crying every night for weeks. The thing is when you’re in an abusive relationship you feel like you can’t ever get out. You feel like you need them but after a few months I realized just how horrible my life was with him in it. And now looking back I am disgusted with myself for ever getting involved with him. He preyed on my age. He took advantage of me being so much younger than him and so influential at the time. It’s just another thing on my list of things I regret. Junior year was a good year for me. I got out of that relationship and really started focusing on myself. I had been on and off medication during this whole time and I was completely off at the start of junior year. I felt clearer than I ever had before. Not to say medication is a bad thing I know it has helped many people but I was put on so many drugs and they had so many horrible side effects. Abilify made me a zombie and made me gain at least 20 pounds within a few months. I took another that gave me nose bleeds daily and made my vision blurry. Overall my medicine experience has not been a good one and I’ve never seen a positive effect from being on them. So when I went into my junior year I focused solely on school. I went to all my classes and did really well. I got straight As that year and my GPA went up a pretty good amount because of it. I took my SAT and got a decent score and I started thinking about college. I really just made a complete 180 during this time and I’m so glad I did. The problem is my depression and anxiety never truly went away. I’m not really sure what’s wrong with me. They told me I was bipolar then later said I had borderline personality disorder. I know you can’t fully diagnose someone with those things during this age so it wasn’t a for sure thing. I don’t know if I really need a label I guess. I fall into deep depressive episodes a lot and I struggle with anxiety and especially social anxiety every day of my life. I don’t have any self confidence and I question everything I do. I struggle to make friends and I don’t trust people easily. I know I have a problem with basing my self worth on what other people think of me and especially men. I get involved with someone and I get so excited and think I’ll finally find someone that’s going to treat me right and they end up being an asshole or completely ghosting me. I stopped cutting myself junior year too but it is still something I still struggle with to this day. When you spent so many years relying on that to help cope it’s hard to not fall back into that self destructive behavior. And even now I sometimes wish I could just go off the deep end like I did when I was younger. A lot of times I feel like I’m just standing on the edge peering down at the abyss. I wanna just jump off head first. But now I wouldn’t even know how to. My feet won’t move. So I’m stuck in this in between place of not totally off the edge but so close I feel it’s presence weighing me down all the time. I really couldn’t tell you a time I felt totally free. Maybe when I was younger and didn’t understand anything. When I didn’t know how awful humans could be to one another. I remember when I was really young at least 5 years old. I was sleeping in my moms bed. My dad had come home probably from a long night of drinking and drugs and I wanted to go out to the kitchen to get a snack.

It was a very toxic relationship with a lot of codependency and now I feel lost, unsure of who I am or where to start to heal.

1079,Doctor and Psychiatrist don’t have any idea what to do to fix my REM behavioral disorder. Advice needed.,"I’m 27. Diagnosed Bipolar Type 1 with PTSD and anxiety.

I take: Lamictal (mood stabilizer) Abilify (anti psychotic) Adderall (stimulant) Fluvoxamine (antidepressant) and recently prescribed Prazosin (lower blood pressure) for my sleep disorder. Psychiatrist told me it prevents REM sleep which is helpful with PTSD patients that experience nightmares.


Here’s my thing: All I can find online about it being used to treat my sleep disorder, are very small trials that yielded different results. And even then, there weren’t many.
I tried it last night. I didn’t have nightmares but I still woke up constantly. Possibly more than usual. I’m going to give it another go tonight.


The recommended treatment for my sleep disorder is melatonin and a low dosage of Klonopin. I was prescribed this for anxiety but after I worked through it and no longer needed the medication, I was prescribed Adderall to help motivate me and keep me awake.


Psychiatrist won’t prescribe both because “You can’t have an upper with a downer” but I need the Adderall because I’m so exhausted all the time and I feel like without the klanopin, I won’t ever be able to feel rested. I also assume if I could finally get some rest, I won’t need Adderall anymore. Regular doctor refuses to give any recommendations because I’m on so many psych meds.


Sorry for the ramble. If anyone has experience with REM behavioral disorder treatment or just any advice in general, it’d be greatly appreciated. I’m exhausted."
1080,Can we share positive things on this post,The world seems like it’s going to shit and I’ve never felt so hopeless in my life. I feel so overwhelmed with all the news I’m reading and I’m desperate for some positive news or anything for that matter that’ll prevent this downward spiral i feel myself slipping into.
1081,Best tips and tricks to avoid relapse with self harm?,I have been clean like 3 years and recently have had the thoughts of self harming again. Everything has been really hard on my mental health lately from being unemployed and sheltered with Covid and now starting a new job that’s really taxing on my mental health. I intend on getting back into therapy eventually but at the moment do not have the funds or even a predictable schedule due to work. For now what are the best ways or methods I can use to cope and avoid relapse?
1082,Anger management tips?,"When I get angry I spiral into bad thoughts but hold everything back because I’m scared of getting judgement or hurting someone, I’m getting angry more often and don’t know what to do about it"
1083,"Unable to speak about the most traumatic events and only giving away the ""less severe"" one.","You sometimes feel like it's impossible to speak about past trauma, even with a mental health expert? For some reason I'm only able to speak about things that seem ""less severe"" to me, hoping I'll be able to talk about the bigger things later, but the day never comes. I've had different therapists over the past few years and one of them was really nice and helpful, but I still couldn't.

 It's like even when I'm scratching on the surface I'll get very realistic dreams, I'm scared to fall asleep because I either relive those events or dream about stuff that gives me the exact same feeling of helplessness. - it throws me back into the state I was 5 years ago at my absolute worst, every single time - it's like I want to tell someone so he can work with me but I also really DON'T want to tell anyone, I need to keep it to myself even if it means I'll break. I'm physically unable to talk about it. I'm kinda okay now, even though I feel my mental health is getting worse again, but at my worst I got triggered by so many things, certain loud noises, some burnt smells, a specific perfume even fire crackers like I'm a fucking dog. Really random things that are around in real life every now and then. 

I guess I'm really bad at reliving the helpless feeling in a potentially life threatening situation, even though I KNOW I'll be physically fine. It's like I lack the energy and balls to talk about it and work on it but I also feel like I can't keep going anymore. I basically stand by myself when things get really bad and I'm just a major inconvenience for everyone around me when I have to go to a clinic, I wish I could do it and also be mentally okay so I can keep fully functioning. :(

Sometimes I feel like I'm also scared of getting ridiculed when I tell someone. Like I assume people won't believe me or something, and it makes me vulnerable. And there is always this underlying feeling of knowing how fucked up some things really are, it's almost surreal and makes me scared of being weak. 

How can I get myself to do it and just talk about the hard hitting stuff that stuck with me?"
1084,"Research Participants Needed for the ""Fear of Crime and ICTs"" Study!","**Have you ever been worried or anxious about crime? Do you use technology, such as the mobile phone and social media?

1085,"I haven’t felt the same since I was 13 years old. I know puberty makes changes on someone life, and they experience changes but mine seemed to not have been a phase.","It has been about 5 years since I felt normal. I know humans are not suppose to be always happy, but I only experience genuine happiness about 2 times a month. Majority of the time, I feel numb, and I usually feel irritated, angry and sad most of the time. I know I’m not suicidal because I don’t think about killing Myself. My anxiety has been off the charts and I would have high rushes of happiness out of now where and feel like I’m hopeless later, but mostly sad. I can’t put everything I’m feeling into word, but if you understand what I’m going through or made any sense of what I said it would mean a lot if anyone helped."
1086,my mind is empty,I think this has been happening for a long time now however recently this problem has been getting worse. I'll be with people and they'll be talking and I'm actively listening but sometimes I just cant respond to them and I'm never able to think of things to start a conversation you know. My mind is just empty I literally am thinking of nothing if that makes any sense. Unless I am specifically addressed I will almost never say anything. I can do the same thing on purpose when I stare at something for a long ass time and my mind is completely void of any thoughts like some sort of auto pilot. I don't know if it's a mental problem or just a skill I need to develop. Listening to people talk it seems like a lot of the time they are just spitting out whatever they are thinking at that current moment and conversations just keep going from there and I wish I could do that too. I feel like im coming off as a boring person because of this (maybe I just am boring idk) and I really want to change
1087,Is anyone schizophrenic? Help,So about a couple weeks ago I used to stay up all night and sleep all day. I went to bed at about 9 am each morning and slept until about usually 8 pm. I had just turned my phone off and was going to lay down one morning and I suddenly hallucinated music and a bird chirping sound. I automatically panicked and genuinely believed I developed schizophrenia. I’ve read online where people would hallucinate when sleep deprived. Nights prior to when it happened my body wanted to sleep but I stayed up anyway. My family has said that I’m a hypochondriac before but I just don’t know. My mind is making me think I’m hallucinating and making me hear things. I’ve also read that people with schizophrenia aren’t aware that they’re ill. Is it all anxiety in my head or am I really schizophrenic? Part of me knows there’s nothing wrong but I feel like I developed psychosis.
1088,Anxiety,Why do I feel uneasy whenever I see someone getting into tasteful music or things that are considered cultured?
1089,Depression while in a relationship,"I’m in a good relationship, we’ve been together almost four years and live together. I deal with a lot of depression and my bf knows that and really tries to help. When I’m really low it affects him too and it makes me feel guilty and I sort of spiral into being more sad and feeling more and more guilty. How do I keep a healthy relationship while dealing with depression? Has anyone dealt with this and have advice?"
1090,I finally asked for help,"It's been a long hard road and recently got extremely harder, I've struggled with depression for a long time. And today was so close to just ending it until someone I had been talking to about our problems messaged and wanted to talk about them. We discussed it for a while and in the end instead of ending it Im now getting the help I need. After Soo many tears today. I already kinda feel a bit better knowing that I'm trying."
1091,I've been having weird thoughts,"Sometimes when I'm home and not doing anything, I just think ""Hey, I could go kill my parents right now"" now hear me out! I will never, EVER act on any of those thoughts as I love my parents and family to death, sometimes it just comes on my mind and I immediately hate myself for thinking that the second after. And it really sucks because I could be having a great time, and then my mood is just ruined. Has anyone else experienced this? (No suicidal/homicidal thoughts btw, I'm just trying to understand why my brain does that lol)"
1092,I want to want something.,I can’t remember the last time I felt an ounce of emotion towards anything. I’m not unhappy pressured just blank and blah. I laugh but it feels all surface and temporary. I just want to WANT to do something. Get excited. Be happy about it or passionate. I take Luvox. That I’m coming off of and I’ve always basically felt like this. And then randomly I’ll get a SURGE of excited happy energy and then it goes away and we’re back to this. Idk why. Any advice?
1093,Struggling to choose between military or getting help.,"I need advice about getting professional help, I'm definitely depressed though I haven't been to a doctor or anything, I discuss why in a minute.

I get what I thought of as phases of not being harassed by depression, I'd be pretty much opposite of depressed, but it was suggested to me that it might be bipolar, I really hope not, I hate self diagnoses I know they're shit and often very inaccurate, but the things I've read are relatable, not just horoscope level relatable but the stuff from people's detailed experiences and actions during their phases, from random bursts of aggression, creative plans and ideas I couldn't have dreamt of, a bunch of motivation for anything from cycling and working out to woodworking and trying to make something that I rarely actually finish and after one or two sessions I never get back to it, I also do stupid and reckless shit nothing that would be too bad for others but could be deadly to me. 

I've gone a bit off track, I want to join the armed forces but I also want to get help with my depression and get tested for bipolar, it's not that I'm in danger of committing suicide, I have decided that I'm not going down that path, but I do want help dealing with the depression, I want to be able to suppress it, here's the problem, I can't get both, I can either take military path and pretty much keep my mental health issues to myself which sounds stupid in itself, or I can go get professional help which does mean kissing the military goodbye, I know on paper the choice is obvious, go get help, but I'm struggling to make the choice, I just really don't know what to do here, I can't really do either till after lockdown is eased so I guess I've still got time to think it over."
1094,that feel when you know you’re going to reach your breaking point soon,"things were going somewhat okay for a week after a traumatic event. I’ve been doing work nonstop for one week with little sleep. it kept me distracted and I was productive. I’m a week ahead of where I would’ve been if I paced things out. 

but now I’m realizing the reality of my life again. things can’t just be avoided. I can’t keep living in the environment I’m in but I also can’t leave yet. it really feels like all I can do is die or wait just a bit longer. I’m trying to wait.

it sucks so much when you have to lie to the doctor about your mental health. I’m almost 17 and I live with my parents. My mom lies about her family history of mental health to professionals when in questions and I don’t know if it’s genetics and/or the environment I grew up in that makes things harder for me. I can’t seek help because it would make things so much worse for me in my external life. 

every tiny thing going wrong right now feel like I’m slowly getting closer to breaking down. I’ve had problems with anger and internalizing anger since I was young and I just can’t hold it in anymore. I really just don’t know what to do anymore. 

thanks for reading. I just needed to get this out — no need to respond to this."
1095,Misdiagnosed and coming off lithium,"I was diagnosed as bipolar II after one ten minute appointment directly after a suicide attempt. I was immediately put on lithium and have been on it for around 8 years. Now after my mental health has actually never been better, both my therapist and psychiatrist mentioned that I should consider that have been misdiagnosed, because in their eyes I did not seem bipolar. Instead they felt I had an anxiety disorder, PTSD, and ADHD. I had suspected as well, but I didn't know that my experience with the doctor who gave me that label wasn't the norm and it often takes several appointments, longer than ten minutes for sure.

So my psych has decided to wean me off lithium, as we suspected I have not experienced any sort of mood swings (not that I ever really had them in a cyclical fashion anyway). But it has only been a week or so.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? I can only find resources for people who ARE bipolar coming off of lithium. What can I expect from the process? I already feel I can think a little clearer, but I really have no idea what to expect after being on it for so long."
1096,How can I stop idealizing the past?,"it’s time that i finally acknowledge the truth of my situation here and seek out some help. ever since summer of last year, things have been different for me, and i mean that in a bad way. i’ll provide a bit of background here. i’m 17 y/o currently and prior to summer of last year, my 2 best friends moved away; the 2 people i spent more time with than anybody else. one being a homeschooler with a large family (which i seemed to connect with much more than my own), and the other being one person who i had a ton in common with, more than i have with anyone else i’ve met. they each moved far away to the point where i’d have to take a plane or drive countless hours to see them, which absolutely broke me. luckily, i got the chance to travel down to atlanta, GA for a few weeks with my friend and his family after they came up to their old house to finish moving out in early July. at first it was tough living a new lifestyle with a new family, but after about a week i couldn’t see myself living any other way. it was fun, but it had it’s flaws. i was outside for a majority of my time there and i was tired all the time. when i returned home, my girlfriend at the time couldn’t stop saying how excited she was to finally see me again. we hung out a day or two after i got back and we were starting to get to know each other better, which made me happy. after this, things slowly turned to hell. we cared for each other, obviously, but she started to cancel plans we had made literally weeks in advance due to issues with her family and mental health. i wanted to be there for her but just couldn’t. we made a whole-day plan for my birthday and she cancelled, and i just let it happen. we broke up about a month later. currently, i’m constantly thinking about only the good memories we had and all of the great things that happened over summer and how i’ll never get to feel like that again. i can’t say that i’ve truly been happy since september of last year. i feel lonely around my friends and family and i constantly spend my days regretting. what can i do to stop thinking of my shitty past in a positive light? all i can think about is my past and i’m always so disconnected from reality. i’m seeing a therapist weekly and it just isn’t cutting it, i feel like shit every second of the day and it’s visible. also, i apologize for not putting my giant brick of text into paragraphs, i’m using mobile right now due to issues with my laptop. thank you all, and stay safe in this wild time"
1097,"Me, a loser that has nothing to live for anymore.","I (11M) (here comes the ""you shouldn't be here"" comments) have been struggling with border line presumed mental insanity and emotional numbness. (I haven't got a diagnosis but I think that would fit me.)

School, the place I call hell. I would be harassed by liking NASCAR, being a Smurf (now that I understand since I am 4'6"" and my other friends are at least 4 '11"" or higher) 

 And I even be harassed for liking baseball! And I 'd be harassed for being ""too sensitive"" or ""dramatic"" since I get hurt a lot. 

And on Field Day, where I got punched and kicked in the eye (and I am not f***ing kidding you) for saying ""you cut in line"" 3 times. And thank God I have blue eyes since I had sunglasses on. I had a mild concussion as told by my parents. And you know what those motherf***ers said to me, ""you were just being dramatic and you didn't get hurt. ""

Yup, my OWN FRIENDS. You have got to be kidding me! Well nope, they just repeated what those you know who people said to me. 

Me: 0 

School: 1 

Note: Field Day was before the COVID-19 pandemic, so stay safe out there!

But there was one person I hated the most, his name I'll call him Rob. (Name changed due to privacy)

At recess, I would play soccer and I think my legs were pretty strong but not as much as him. 

One simple mistake, and wouldn't you know, he would lash out on me like a 7th grade English teacher.

And he would always say to me if I accidentally passed to an opponent, he would say ""You should of passed to me."" While having 4 men covering him, good job Rob. And he had his buddy, I'd call him, Jim, he wasn't as much as a arrogant douchebag as Rob, I actually used to be best friends with Rob. 
 
Me: 0

School: 2

 But this is where this gets interesting.

A couple of months ago, I was told I was getting a packet due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I had to wait 3 weeks just to get a packet, 3 F***ING WEEKS! And I was damn stressed out of the packet, since it had like I don't know, 30 F***ING PAGES, and guess the time I was supposed to complete it by, 1 F***ING WEEK! So I had to complete a average of 6 pages per day. Mine that that's more than we do in a day at regular school. I am pretty fed up of this, but didn't tell my parents since they laughed at me before when I told him that I might be messed up.

I listened to music, especially rock music. But I felt like that there was a comparison between Me and a album that is unknown when people talking to new music and all that things I'm not into. Enter Pink Floyd's The Wall, a album I consider to be the greatest of all time.

This album is a 26 song masterpiece double album about a man that struggles through his dad dying in WWII and his overprotective mother, and School. Doesn't stop there when he has to deal with his girlfriend cheating on him while he is a well known rockstar.
10/10 would recommend but it has some really feel songs like Don't Leave Me Now.

The School part with that album, really hits me.

Fast forward to a week ago, I wasn't doing any school work since I have been burnt out of everything, I have been isolating myself against my family since I have just been burnt out of everything except YouTube, Anime, Roblox, and Bloons TD Battles. My parents don't think I have some sort of mental issues, School is just been a living hell to me and sucking my life out, my brother just annoys the hell out of me, my friends at this point just think my mental issues are fake just like they told me about me getting hurt, and I don't think I would want to live in a place where everything and everyone treats me like shit.

Thank you for listening."
1098,Feel like crap,Anyone else just feel like a totally piece of shit? I feel so two-faced and full of myself and lazy and mean and judgemental. I'm just really sick of myself. I just do such stupid shit man...
1099,Scared. Sad. It’d be better if I died.,"So, I’ve (23, F) kind of got years of baggage to unpack, but right now I’m so scared. 

I feel like crap. I’m pissing away my college education. I want to graduate, I really do. I want to do well. I keep failing classes. I don’t set out to, and I start with every intention to do better. But my mom is abusive. She sucks me into her misery. She’s an alcoholic. I’m tired of letting myself get pulled into the cycle all over again. 

But really, there’s no excuse. This is my responsibility and I’m fucking up. I’m scared to talk to my administrators or instructors because I know it’s my fault. I know I don’t deserve sympathy. I need to be stronger than my mother. Than the trauma from my abusive ex. 

Honestly, I’d be better off dead. I’m going nowhere. I want to stop trying."
1100,"I've been diagnosed with Emotional deprivation disorder (EDD) at 6y/o, im 28 now...",I've always wondered if it is a form au autism? Does anyone knows? I've google it but the answers were not very clear so I decided to check here to see if anyone would know :( thank you!
1101,I am not okay,"I am not okay. 

Honestly, it's taken me a lot of time and self-reflection to accept this. For a long time, I've done everything to convince myself that I *was* okay. I tried telling myself I was. I tried ignoring the problems. I tried running from them. I convinced myself the constant exhaustion, the irritability, the lack of self-confidence and abundance of self-doubt, the ever present fear and trepidation were all normal. That they were just part of living life. 

And occasionally, it worked. For a while at least. But the issues always came back. And each time they were worse. They hit harder, and put me on my ass for longer. And it cost me more and more each time. It's cost me two jobs I loved. It cost me any confidence I've ever had in a better future for myself. And every time, I told myself that I can just pick myself up, dust myself off, and keep moving. 

But I can't. No matter how hard I try, I can't just keep pushing myself. I can't keep doing what I've been doing. It doesn't work. It took me a long time to admit this to myself. It took me a long time to listen to everything that I've been telling myself, and everything that the people around me have been telling me, because I didn't want them to worry. I didn't want to put extra strain on them, especially because I know that many of them are going through some of the exact same things I am. I wanted to be there for everyone. But I finally realized that I can't be there for anyone if I can't be here for *me.*

So it's taken me a long time to finally say this: I am not okay. And that's okay. Because someday, maybe someday soon, but more likely quite some time from now, I will be."
1102,Olanzapine,"Hi guys, my mom just got prescribed 10mg of olanzapine and it’s her first night taking it. She hasn’t slept for more than 2 hours in the past week. Does anyone have personal experience with the drug and could help me out? Weight gain is not an issue because she is quite skinny at the moment. Will she be out for a while, it’s her first night taking it. I hope all is good. Thanks so much"
1103,Can you help me?,"I think I rewrote this about a million times. And each time I feel I cannot get the words out that I want to say. But it feels good to rewrite because then I am no longer thinking of ending my life or the pain that has brought me to it. I feel like I’m caught in a limbo. I have been for years now. And everyday that passes, the next bout of sadness that comes makes me more desperate than the last. 

Some context to where I am coming from. I have a sick (has epilepsy) younger brother I no longer am close to. My parents have always hit me and yelled at me a lot but only me, my brother was never hit even when he was not sick . My mother and I are basically estranged. My mother adores and loves my brother. My father scares me but can act like a goof and makes me forget why I fear him. I have been hit and yelled cruel words at. I wake up to the words almost every day and if not when I wake up then it will be definitely during the day. Its become so that I wake up with cold sweat and a racing heart. I don’t get yelled at once or twice, it’s constant. I sometimes think if I cannot kill myself then maybe I should go deaf. I will not have to hear such words and I can pretend all is well. It was almost  nine years ago when I had decided that living was not worth the pain. The night I decided it I had planned everything out and decided that the next day I would ride out and do it. Ofc that did not happen since I am here now. and that is all because I dreamt that night that I had been loved and Ever since I have held on to that dream, that one day I will be loved, that this will all work out, that I will no longer feel like this and that I can live because life will get better. 

And so here I am years later and still stuck. I may not cry myself to sleep everyday as I used to but when I do I am desperate to fall asleep to dream the same dream that made me keep living and unfortunately dreams don’t work like that and I don’t always dream the reason to stay alive. And what has prompted me to post this today is that I had been yelled at to start to study for next term in September. Yelled at in a way that I felt if I did not obey my likelihood to getting hit was very f***ing high. I’m a uni student and so I have a bit longer summer break than others. I see why I should study but this is the first summer where I am not in school and I wanted to take this summer to enjoy life, to once again remember or find reason to keep going on. Ofc I cannot go travel as I had planned but I thought being at “home” will not hinder that determination. But being 22 and still not having the courage to stand up for myself in fear of getting hit, hurts. I think of taking my life and ending it all but two things stop me. 1. It would mean I have given up on the idea that I will be happy one day (and this is a problem because I am stubborn and I don’t like to give up) 2. It would mean my parents will find out I did end my life and they will have to live with that and I cannot put them through that after what they went through with my brother. Even after all the hate, I love my parents and it’s a reason why I fear being in a relationship. If I love them as deep as my parents such that I cannot let go even when I know it is what is hurting me. I don’t think I could take being hurt from both my family and the man I love. 

And so here I am, wanting to die but can’t put myself through it. But with every passing argument, I end up not caring a bit more and I can just feel it, that I’m on the way to one day ending it all and maybe I can finally find some peace. 

I do not know where to go from here. I wish to live to find love and peace one day but I know if I continue on the way I am, I don’t think I will make it. And so my question to whoever is reading is, can u help me?"
1104,I feel like a coward sometimes,"I've been having alot of mood swings lately (im bi polar) and I just feel like I am too afraid of killing myself, it would be so easy to do but I just can't do it (I guess its the unknown of the afterlife that makes me stay alive). Sometimes I feel sick of being alive , it mentally makes me feel weak... I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror, all  I see is the self hatred, my life has been unfulfilling for the most part, but I won't kill myself myself, I won't physically hurt myself either, I will live on, but it is draining."
1105,Where to find reliable online therapist?," Hi, I want to get an online therapist considering the state of the world. If you are so curious about why then read my posts. But I was wondering where I actually get a therapist"
1106,I don't want to live.,"So I'm a 14 y/o currently studying in grade-10 or high school to some of you, and recently I have been overwhelmed by this thought of the purpose of my existence. I have been asking myself I wanna really live, right now I'm just existing. No I'm not depressed, I don't think there's anything pushing me to the edge of a cliff rather it's more like there's nothing to pull me back, there's nothing I wanna live for. I usually busy myself in what normal teens do these days: videogames, anime and internet. Not very long ago I realized that to  properly live and enjoy life I'm going to have to indulge myself in activities that I genuinely cant get enough of, something which I will be willing to do not because of it's result but because I wanna do it no matter what comes of it, I wanna take the hardship and struggle that I will enjoy and at the end of the day all the hardwork will be worth it regardless if I succeed or fail, only there's nothing I wanna do in life. I don't know the purpose of my existence. And I don't wanna be one of those people who study hard and get a good pay and get all the riches they want and in the end realize that life is more than money and a respectable position in society, so long story-short there's nothing I think I want to do in life. When I was in grade 6 my test result went from 80+ to range of 60 or lower and my family and teachers started acting like most parent and teacher would react and because of that I thought I was a nuisance to my family and ran away from home. I subconsciously was pressured from study and didn't even realize I was being study-pressured until my uncle told me that was the reason I ran away. I was about 10-11years of age at that time, so I don't wanna get a good degree. I respect skill and knowledge, I'm a guy who is interested in science but I don't pay much attention at class, I have told myself that whatever I am to become in the future wont be because of my academic grades or degrees but because of the time and effort I will have invested in an activity solely. I haven't found a purpose and I cant live depending on other people forever and I'm thinking if I will be better of dead, not like I'm doing anything existing anyway; neither for myself neither for others."
1107,It feels hopeless,"Everything I do is crap. My opinion doesn't matter. When I wake up I regret everything I've ever done and it hurts. I have constant anxiety attacks, my own friends deny I feel this way and it's so annoying. It feels hopeless I've tried to stay happy but it's impossible"
1108,My husband has a suicide plan,"A couple of nights ago my husband almost went through with a suicide plan. He got up abruptly in the middle of an argument we were having, and began writing down all of his passwords and banking information for me. I was able to convince him to stop and promise that he would not kill himself that night, and we went to bed. I have spent the past couple of days working on getting him set up with a therapist, even though he does not want to go. 

This has all been super upsetting for me, and I have my own therapy appointment tomorrow. I want to talk to my therapist about what happened, to get advice and also process, but I don’t want to put her in a position where she would be obligated to call a psych hold for him.

My long term partner (22M) has had depression for the last 4 years and a few weeks back, he fell into(? sorry if that is the wrong terminology) a depressive episode. It is the first one he has had while we are a couple and I am finding it hard to know what to do.

I am reading sites and books and trying to understand what is happening but my emotions get in the way. I get really tearful because it is so hard seeing the person I love become a shell of himself. But I feel like this thinking makes the situation worse and I want to find coping mechanisms so that I can support him better and also protect my own mental health.

I have looked for psychologists/therapists/counsellors for myself online but since there is so much going on in the world, it is difficult to get an appointment soon. But I want to start getting advice and coping mechanisms as soon as I can.

Does anyone have any advice or coping mechanisms or thought processes that I can use to better support him and also not be super upset myself? 

(I plan on going back to the gym when restrictions are lifted and I go back to university in 2 months so hopefully that will help me have other support systems, but I can't right now :()"
1110,Homicidal Ideation?,"(Not asking for a diagnosis, just wondering it all in about to state below is just normal intrusive thoughts)

So anyway, hello. I'm 14 and from the USA. I'm making this post because recently I've wondered if my thoughts/actions were normal. 
I don't really remember the first time I've thought about hurting someone, but the earliest I can remember is of me wanting to kill my friends. I've always wanted to hurt them, but about 5 years (maybe) ago I had planned on killing them. I had gotten a knife from the kitchen and wrapped the handle with paper towels, so finger prints wouldn't be on it, and had sat on my couch thinking it over. Looking back on it the way I would have done it would have immediately gotten me caught. I think this has happened 2 times I think? 
Skip now a year later in May or so of 2016. I was going over to my cousins (which I hate and have always and do plan on hurting him some way one day) I was in some angsty mood or something and thought that ""this is the night I'm gonna kill him "" so I grabbed a butter knife before we left and put it in my pocket. I don't really remember much but I do remember holding him down and putting the knife against his neck. A few seconds later I removed the knife and tried to put it off and tried to make it seem like a joke after I decided against it. He's ran off and told but boy, I wish I could remember the look of fear on his face all the way, it's exciting. 
Now skip to this year and the previous, I'm not gonna go into much detail but one night of being verbally abused I had such, strong urges to hurt the person who was doing it. That happens ALOT. And I've recently (few months ago) called CPS on them so it does down.
I have thoughts of cutting off someone's limbs and making some way of keeping their mouth open, then stabbing them in the lungs and throw them into our lake so they struggle to breath, but can't do anything.
Also of forcing a big object down their throats or up the other end nd watch them writhe in pain. Don't wanna get too detailed
 
But I just wanted to know if this could possibly be homicidal ideation"
1111,I want to improve my health but I have a weird thing about sweating,"My step dad was really abusive and being a girly girl teenager I hated sweating. My anxiety around sweating started when my step dad would yell at me about it.

Like in his mind you aren't working hard unless you're sweating? So he'd scream and threaten me about how he'd make me sweat (plus that I was useless etc)

In retrospect it's a weird thing to be hung up about on his part. But it's made me super anxious about being  sweaty, or doing a lot of physical activity that leads to sweating. Like when it happens I feel the same as I did when we would scream and yell at me.

But I'm overweight, and I want to be healthier. And I've started with ring fit adventure on switch (pretty good if you want to try).

But everytime i feel sweaty I feel anxious and terrible and stop. And I know i should push through and keep going but I feel like it's too much right now, which really frustrates me.

And idk, some advice or kind words would be nice?"
1112,Testing,I tried to post something earlier and it is not showing up. I want to test to see if this time it works
1113,Feeling very lost and hopeless right now,"Several days ago my dad and I got into a physical altercation. My dad has been known to have a violent temper and responds to any of our criticisms with ""shut the fuck up"", ""be quiet"" or other means of intimidation because he is the ""father"" and we should know our place. Over the years, I've learned to suppress my emotions and sit quietly

We were having lunch as a family when we started having a conversation regarding the current events happening. At this point, my dad was at a disagreement with me and yelled ""be quiet. stop talking"". This time I told him ""I'm not going to be quiet anymore"". Everything escalated from there as he told me to leave. I was gathering my things to leave and as I walked towards the door, he got up to physically fight me. My mom got in between us as we ended up on the couch. After about 20 mins of yelling, he left the house.

That night my sister and mom talked to me and I had thought we had an understanding that we need to fix his behavior and that it was wrong. Unfortunately, I guess I was wrong. My mom's solution was to tell me to avoid him ""for now"" thinking that she would talk to him first. That hasn't happened. My sister contacted a priest who told me "" to think of my mom and sister's health"".

Not knowing where to go from here, this has honestly been the worst feeling ever. Am I wrong? Did I just fuck up my family? I thought I had support but I guess not. 

TL;DR Got into a physical altercation with my dad. I don't know what to do from here."
1114,Weirdly Struggling in a Way I Can't Describe,"Hello,

I have a lot of personal issues. I have a lot of anxiety and my own mental health issues (I think I'm bipolar) but this is beside the issue I'm asking for help with.

I'm 30, and despite everything, I live home with my parents. And they HATE each other. I don't know how else to explain it. My dad is in AA (and I think suffers from brain damage from surgery) and the easiest way to describe him is a complete narcissist. Everything is about him. Everything. Like it's okay to see a movie he's interested in, or buy something he wants to buy, or talk about something he wants to talk about. He's sexist, slightly racist, he calls my mom fat a lot because she has gained weight. And my mom is someone super kind-hearted, has slightly alcoholic tendencies (from my viewpoint related to my dad), shes likes this hopeless romantic, with liberal viewpoints who just wants like a proper partner in her life. I think my dad has cheated on her, like I have every reason to believe she has (he particularly hints towards it when we're smoking weed together, like all the women he has had).

I guess what I'm asking for advice with. I'm stuck here while I'm trying to finish school, trying to put my own life on track. How do I play the neutral medium here. How can I stay out of their marital problems when I completely think my mom should dump his ass and start her life anew (she doesn't because she has a huge pension and would give half of it to him). He's a terrible human being but I'd be homeless without being allowed to live here. How do I deal with it? 

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm just trying to get through the day-to-day drama. I'm just trying to get through my own shit, ya know? How can I get through this. I feel like if I pick a side, I'm going to be the bad guy. And I don't want to pick a side, I don't want to be the guy that caused their divorce. I don't know if anyone has been through this before, but I just need to get through the next 2 years or so before I plan to move away and let them sort their own problems out. Any advice is appreciated."
1115,Difficult friend.,"Hello, first time posting here, just looking for some advice. So, I have a friend who I’ve known for over 10 years, and recently their mental health has declined a lot. They’ve always struggled but it’s debilitating at this point, as in, can attend school and when they do it’s only for two lessons. I’ve also struggled with my own mental health and been in situations where I’ve had to help friends before. I’ve been really trying to help them get back on track, but they seem to be just getting worse. I thought it was me, but I’ve looked up almost everything I can do to offer support in the correct ways, and I’ve been doing that. I’m not sure what to do at this point; I hardly see them irl so I have to offer support online, but they turn their phone off. It really scares me because sometimes what they say is really worrying then they don’t reply for days and I just spiral. I really really really want to help them get better, and get my friend back. But it doesn’t seem like they want to come back. I want to support them but it’s taking a toll on my mental health. Any advice for different ways I can support my friend and myself? (Btw, they are on medication and go to therapy often). Thanks x"
1116,Drowning,"From past few days, I feel like I am drowning literally. 
I am tired of screaming and asking for help so I am going to stop. 
My hands sometimes involuntarily try to save me but I don't want to.
 I want to go. I seriously don't care. 

Each month I feel like I hit a new rock bottom which I couldn't thought was possible. I don't know how to say it and I feel guilty both for my parents and God but I think I am just weak. I am not meant to be. 

I had addiction issues and was in serious depressing shit  but I thought I had hope and can change. Which I did partly , came out of those addiction and tried to change my life. It didn't change. 

Right now I feel like a cosmic joke. I just want to go and escape from here. 
Sorry , I needed to vent this out. Thanks for listening."
1117,I keep think of past memories that are sad or when people I love upset me. I feel like this is why I can’t be happy like everyone else. How do I overcome this ?,
1118,Tonight was a disaster.,"This is going to be long.

So I’ve been keeping track of all the times I’ve hit low points these past couple months. Ever since late March, I’ve been feeling incredibly awful and the idea of self harm has been looking better and better the more time passes. I’ve been able to keep myself from physically harming myself, but I still have serious thoughts of suicide and wanting to disappear entirely. I may not have the courage to ever follow through on suicide, but the pain is so great that I constantly wish I could dissolve into dust and cease to exist. I argue back and forth with myself, as I’m aware certain thoughts are lies my brain is trying to tell me, but it’s gotten harder and harder to push those thoughts away. Ever since the month mentioned above, I haven’t been able to go more than two weeks without a depressive episode (this phrase is the best way I can describe what’s happening, but I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, nor am I self-diagnosing).

Tonight, things came to a head and I was unable to fight off many of the awful thoughts I’ve had about myself. The summer semester of college has started; it’s only week one and I’m already behind. I only work weekends and otherwise stay at home since COVID-19 is still a major factor. I don’t have an exercise routine and my eating habits have been slipping a lot again. Tonight, everything came crashing in on me and I couldn’t think of myself as anything more than a lazy, good-for-nothing leech who can’t even be bothered to handle the responsibilities they have. I beat myself up for not being able to handle something so simple as schoolwork, for not buckling down and getting shit done. I called myself a terrible, awful human being who contributes nothing to society and thought everyone would be better off if I just stopped existing. That’s something I dream about a lot. Not *dying,* but just...disappearing into nothing as if I were never there in the first place. Falling asleep and never waking up. I thought the world would be better off if I had never existed in the first place.

Having told close friends and family about such thoughts, my mom gave me the number to a suicide hotline. A small part of me reasoned that this was a good time to try and call, but I’ve always had a lot of anxiety about phone calls, so I opted for the online chat option instead.

...It...took a while.

I had to psych myself up for it in the first place because not only was I afraid to connect, but I also felt guilt and shame because I believed it was stupid to go running to the hotline over *schoolwork,* even though I knew there were a lot more detrimental thoughts that needed to be addressed than just that. Even then, there was a waiting line, and I couldn’t stop shaking and crying because I was so terrified they would think I was just another whiny bitch who wanted attention and was too lazy for college. I was still afraid once I got to the front of the waiting line, but once I hit connect and entered in the information it asked for...nothing. All the counselors were busy.

I threw my phone down and cried some more, feeling like a total moron for even *attempting* something so stupid. It wasn’t their fault. They had more important people to talk to, people that *really* needed the help. Not lazy freeloaders like me.

All the crying tired me out soon enough and I just felt *tired.* I still do. I thought I was doing something right by using a resource  given to me by my mom in an attempt to help, but I came out of it feeling like a fucking idiot. Now I’m exhausted and am no closer to getting any of my schoolwork done that’s due by 5:00pm tomorrow (it’s 1:37am here).

Overall, tonight was a disaster. I don’t know how I’ve made it this far, but I’m not sure how much longer I can keep going. I was too afraid to reach out to anyone close because I felt they would tell me I was being over dramatic, or that they deserved better than to hear about my woes and sorrows again. My doctor gave me a list of therapists that are covered under my insurance, but I haven’t done anything with it yet. I’m just... I guess I’m afraid. Frozen. Once I’m in that low point, I become paralyzed and can’t see a clear way out, even though I’ve been told time and time again to reach out to others for support when things get bad like that. I’ve said to others that I can only help them so much and that it’s up to them to help themselves, but then what the hell am *I* doing? Sitting here, letting my mind eat away at me again.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe to finally speak up since I couldn’t seem to open my mouth earlier. I don’t know how to talk when deep in the throes of sadness, but I can’t keep going on like this. Something’s got to give sooner or later and I’m afraid it’ll eventually be *me.* If I could just learn how to *act,* then maybe something could change, but... Deep down, I’m a coward.

And I hate myself that much more for it."
1119,I think I'm spiralling,"Warning: this is going to be really messy and repetitive just because I was typing as I was thinking, and I started crying like immediately. Sorry if it's confusing, you don't have to reply, I've just felt like I've been ""the smart one who people go to when they have questions about politics and have things they need to vent about"" and it's really really really getting to me. I just needed a place to write it down where I know people will read it, or at least have the chance to.

  
I have major depression and general anxiety, so with the current situation involving protests, riots, and the whole pandemic bullshit, I'm starting to doubt that I truly have a future. I feel like once I get out of college its just the edge of a cliff and I'll have nowhere to go. The country I live in is turning into a fascist dystopia and I fear for the safety of many of my friends and family since they are people of colour, yet I can't do anything to help them besides the bare minimum since I'm only 15. When I was younger I used to have suicidal ideations since I doubted that I even had a future after 13 and now I'm starting to get them again. I want to keep the people I love safe and I hate that they have to live in a world where they get scared for their lives when a cop pulls them over for a traffic violation but I can't protect them in the way I want to. The whole world feels like a prison and I don't know if there's anywhere to go, since it feels like right now every single fucking country has racist law enforcement. We can't escape it at all, and every day it just feels like its getting worse and worse. protestors are being unjustly arrested, gassed, and shot every fucking day. More and more people of colour are being killed. More events involving police brutality are being put in the spotlight, which is not a bad thing. It's amazing that these are coming to light so that more victims can have justice and their murderers can be given the consequences they deserve, but it's fucking horrible that it takes weeks, months, years even for this to happen. I just want the people I love to be safe but there is nowhere to run and hide and tell them its okay. If feels like there is no safe haven aside from death. Everywhere people are dying. Everywhere there is teargas and bombs and guns and military and cops and prisons and fascists and fucking evil evil evil people who don't care how many people die as long as they get their 5 figure paycheck at the end of the month. It makes me just want to kill myself since clearly there's nowhere else to go. I most likely won't do anything since I have a younger brother, and he looks up to me. I don't want him to grow up knowing his older sister killed herself because she couldn't take it, he doesn't deserve to have that on his conscious. Still, I have the desire, and I have a deep dark hole in me that I can't make just go away for a minute and let me up for air."
1120,I can feel my mental health slowly slipping,"I've never been diagnosed with any mental illnesses or experienced any debilitating mental problems but ever since being socially isolated due to quarantine, I've noticed my mental health plummet. Things are starting to get back to normal irl but my self image/self confidence are still lower than ideal. It's been months and I just want to feel good enough to get stuff done. This is mostly a rant but advice is appreciated."
1121,"I called a wellness check on my friend, but they didn't get sent to the hospital. What do I do? (TW: mentions of s**cide and s*lf h*rm)","Background info: This situation involves me and my friends M, K, and P. We were friends since middle school; we will be juniors this fall. 
P's dad had died back in September, and her dog also passed away a few months later that same year. She stopped coming to school and started therapy, and my friends and I did stay in contact with her for a while, but M and I eventually stopped talking to her. She just stopped confiding in us and we had nothing else to talk about like we used to, so we just sort of fell out with her. K talked with her, I don't know how often, but they remained pretty close. 

Two days ago, K and M told me that P was planning her suicide. K had been following her spam on instagram, and apparently P had blocked M and I on it. I don't know when or why, I just knew we were blocked, and that K was the only irl friend P had on there. The rest were internet friends. On that account, P had been expressing that she was in pain and she just wanted it to end. Throughout the captions on her posts, we were able to figure out that she felt as though therapy wasn't working and that her therapist knew ""one part"" of her plan. She was on suicide watch and her mom had hidden the pills, but she said it didn't matter for now because she planned to do it in August and that her method would be a surprise. She also posted some pics of her scarred arm and scissors. She did mention that she wouldn't go through with it if a miracle happened and that she wanted to experience happiness again, but this was all still concerning so we decided to call authorities to perform a wellness check on her yesterday. However, this backfired, so she confronted K and M and blocked them, knowing they had called authorities because they were the only ones who had directly told her that they were concerned. We still had hope she was sent to the hospital for her safety, but today, I was able to see that she was actively posting on instagram meaning she was still home. I don't know if her mom took further precautions to prevent her from hurting herself, but I still think it would be better if she were in the hospital under close professional watch. 

Since she hasn't blocked me and doesn't know that I know of her plan, I am the only one who can reach out to her now. I plan to befriend her again so she knows she is not alone, but I'm scared that she will ask if K and M told me about her condition. I don't want her to block me because we will never be able to help her anymore if that happens. I'm so scared and I really don't want her to kill herself and I'm trying so hard to give her the best chances without losing her from my sight. I know she has her mom and her three siblings, but if she was able to hurt herself even after being put on watch, I don't think leaving her at home would be the best for her. 

What do I do now? Am I doing the right thing by befriending her and risking being blocked? Or is it just best to watch from afar and hope her posts don't stop once it hits August?"
1122,Having a complete breakdown,"Hi I’ll preface this with a bit of my background. I have Bipolar I, and some other issues. I have had life long struggles starting since early childhood due to being raised in a very volatile environment. I had extreme behavioral issues as child and was in and out of therapy, in patient behavioral institutions/psych hospitals, and long term residential programs. I think due to a combination of mental health issues and my environment. During these times where I was institutionalized I was raped, beaten, starved etc. I spent much of my childhood in these scenarios as my parents while successful weren’t equipped to parent. I graduated high school a year late and it took me until I was nearly 21 to get into college. 25 to get my Bach. I’m nearly 29, and finished my masters degree last summer. I spent my time post graduate school traveling and selectively applying to jobs. I finally landed my dream job...during all of this. I moved to SF and spent several thousand dollars for moving costs, furniture, etc. recently we received work from home orders for another year plus+. I decided to break my lease to Move in with family and am spending thousands more to do so to move out (about 15k total past 3 months) so I don’t have to pay Bay Area rent. 

I feel so detached from reality. I’m having full on night terrors and nightmares. Multiple panic attacks a week. I’m having breakdowns. I’ve fought so hard for everything I have to get where I am now. and then the world collapses. I’m staring to dissociate from realty. It’s impacting my job which I started remotely and will be indefinitely. I can’t afford to not have this job. I literally climbed Mount Everest with no arms and legs to get to this point. But every waking moment I’m thinking about killing myself. I can barley function and have to drag myself through my work day for the dream job I spent 7 years in college with overlap of years of internships/work to get. I couldn’t think of a more perfect place to work or job position to have. I don’t know want to do. I can’t even fathom my situation where I start my career remotely and will be working remotely until further notice. I’m somebody who is very outgoing and extroverted and always on the move. But now I’m just existing. And I want to die. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m experiencing severe suicidal ideations. I’m barely sleeping. I’m barley eating. I just want to die. I know I have to push through this but I don’t know how. I don’t know how I can make. I finally escaped my life circumstances and ended back at the starting point. Idk."
1123,Help describing an episode I had (23m),"Hi, (oblig on my phone formatting apologies)

About a year and a half ago I was in the process of dropping out of college, but at that point I was still forcing myself to go to class about two days a week. I was walking from my house to school, about a mile, and I was crossing the street when a girl coming the opposite way smiled and said something to me that in retrospect was probably hello or something like it, and the more I think about now, it was probably someone I had met before because it was a small school, but I didn't recognize her at the time.For some reason, all I heard her say was ""I know what you did"". 

Obviously I felt attacked and my instinct was both fight and flight and so my response was an angry ""WHAT?"" as I kept walking. I looked back when I crossed the street and she didn't look back. I think I scared her. Ive felt bad about it since almost immediately after it happened.

I've never felt that attacked before and I've never behaved that way before either. I'm not an angry person and never angry like that. It's probably worth noting that I was a bit stoned and sleep deprived at the time, but no more than ordinary for me.

I've been doing my own research but I'd be really interested in other people's opinions about that situation. Thanks, appreciate you all."

1127,Is it okay to forgive and still love your abuser?,"My dad grew up with an extremely abusive cop Dad, my mom grew up with a recovering alcoholic but still abusive dad as well. My dad has beat me my whole life, to the point I’d characterize it as beyond “spanking” or “reprimanding” which I don’t agree with but like, I was thrown against a wall and to the floor and dragged by my hair by a man 5 times my size a couple of times. My TV was thrown into the wall and there’s a dent in it still, we also had to cover up a closet door with some dumb wall art to hide the hole he punched through it. 
      My younger sister has faced the same but now acknowledges I was more targeted by the violence and she would try to protect me and felt so bad when it happened. My Mother who I love to death and I know wants the best for me turned a blind eye, she said her abuse was worse and what I was going through was nothing in comparison.
     I want to break this cycle and if I have kids never I’ll fucking never hurt them. But the issue is I still love my Dad. The man who has psychically abused me most of my life. I seek his approval to this day. He had a hard childhood and his father was even more abusive so he see’s this as normal, he also has severe OCD and I feel bad for him and like he doesn’t know any better or any different.

Although, I think I'm slowly sinking back into all of this and I'm trying my best to keep my head up but recently with the pandemic I've been feeling worst than ever... I want to communicate with a therapist or at least a psychologist but I don't really have to money to afford it, and I'm so scared to even call one

I have already chronic migraines and they increased, my fingertips are slowly turning blue, and I'm feeling lightheaded each time I stand up
Worst of all is I'm sleep deprived, I'm scared to sleep, I'm constantly having nightmares. It plays horribly on my mood, I'm always on the edge of having a breakdown, and god, i'd lie if I didn't try to get wasted drunk without my mother knowing despite promising to stay clean

My mom keep trying to shove pills down my throat saying they will help me, half of the time I'm high on aphrodisiacs and have difficulty breathing if i stay awake for too long, but then i fall back into those disgusting nightmares and the cycle restart. insomnia. panic. breakdown. pills. sleep. nightmares.

I tried hiding all this suppressed frustration and anxiety for so long to my friends and my boyfriend but I think they're slowly realizing my mask is breaking down and that i'm not fine, i'm scared, i don't want them to see me like this
I'm a mess

i'm so tired, i don't know where to seek for help anymore
i guess this sort of is a cry for help? I'm desperate, and my mother visibly won't help my case, she thinks I'm just overdramatic and i should drug myself until I'm numb

1129,I think I’m a pedophile,"I (19F) just want to preface this by saying that in real life I do not feel attracted to children. 

But recently (and I feel disgusted with myself saying this) I found this anime character that I really connected with and found myself attracted to. So much so I masturbated to him. But he is 12. 

Oh god just writing that out is gross.

He doesn't look like he's gone through puberty so there is no excuse. I'm still attracted to him.

He's the cool type of character and he gets so much character development throughout the show, I wondered if maybe I'm just attracted to his personality. But I know its definitely his aesthetic too. He’s so cute, but can be so hot sometimes but *gag* he’s a fucking kid, but it doesn’t matter to me in the moment like wtf. 

Worse is that I especially like the parts when he's crying, like when he's going through a breakdown. I am sickened by myself. I am getting turned on watching a 12 year old anime boy crying for his friend, like what the fuck is wrong with me? 

I have not been attracted to a character this young before ever. And l've never been attracted to kids in real life either. It’s just this one fucking character.

I am still attracted to people my own age and older and I would never ever touch a kid in real life. But I googled it and you don’t need to to still be considered a pedophile.

Is there something wrong with me? Am I a pedophile? I am really scared."
1130,I need help being a better person,"I’ve completely done life wrong, I’ve fucked up at every single turn, my mom died because of me, because I was to stupid to  Realize something was wrong and help her. I stayed back because I’m slow I’ve been in lower level classes my whole life Because I haven’t put the effort in to get out of them I don’t think I’ve ever tried to do anything good for people and in general I’m just a disgusting leech of a thing, I wish I could rewind time and fix everything but it’s too late now I feel like if multiple reality’s actually exist I’m living in one of the worser one you know what I mean? Like I never knew my biological dad But I heard he was an abusive drug dealer who dropped out in middle school, and I’m really scared I have his anger issues because I know I can be really toxic sometimes and I don’t know how to fix it. I don’t know what to do? How do I fix myself?"
1131,I feel trapped,"I'm currently 19 year old male. I've just decided to take a hiatus from editing videos for a friend of mine across the country.  I felt like I had little reason to do it other than I felt bored and didn't want to do it. I was being paid weekly but after about 6 months of doing it I just got bored. And now I feel like the only job that suited me is slipping away. I have many other interests and hobbies that I've wanted to pursue. Now I currently want to get into fighting game tournaments even though I know jack shit about fighting games (I know it's crazy) But whats even crazier is that I just started playing a fighting game (Guilty Gear xrd) for only 2 weeks. And whats even weirder is that I feel like I'm either sabotaging my enjoyment of the game because I want to commit every fiber of my being to get good at it or I've already lost interest in the game but I'm trying my best to trick my brain into thinking that. The reason I'm taking about this situation in particular is because it feels like an example of patterns in my life were I decide to pursue this passion of mine but decide to walk away because I feel like it's too hard or some other stupid excuse. It's drives me crazy and it makes me feel like I'm going to end up a lazy fucking failure. I don't want a ""real"" job. I can't imagine doing shit like being a lawyer or a doctor and not wanting to blow your brains out. I worked part time in retail for two months bagging most of the time and cashiering on the side. After being unable to handle the pressure of customers, I had a mental breakdown at home. Having mental breakdowns every 3 months has been a common occurrence since I was a freshman in highschool. I was diagnosed with anxiety at that time and my parents (especially my mom) are extremely overprotective even today and rightfully so due to the amount of time I wailed shit like, ""I WANT TO FUCKING DIE!"" or something like that. Thing is though, I don't want to die. In fact, I'm fucking scared of dying. I want to live my life to the fullest. Have my own roof to live under, I kind and thoughtful girlfriend with similar tastes, freedom to travel and all that good shit but the real world tells my that I'm not mentally fit or strong enough to get to that state. I've been scared of talking to girls, my height has always bothered me (currently around 5'4), and as I've said before I don't even want a real job and If I aspire to be something like a participant in fighting game tournaments (terrible example I know) it'll take sacrifices that I feel like I don't have the balls to make. On top of that I haven't bothered getting a drivers licence and the recent pandemic has stopped me from doing so. Honestly, I don't even know where I'm going with this. At the moment, I just don't want to get into another spell of angry outbursts and breakdowns. My life just feels like a cycle of me feeling great one day and feeling like shit the next and it feels like there is no way to end the cycle. Theres a voice in my head that screams ""I want to die"" even though I don't. I know things take time but I'm fucking impatient. So fucking impatient."
1132,Could I be 'suffering' from some sort of Trichotillomania?,"Hello, I'm a 22 year old male. I watched a TLC documentary about this girl who had an obsessive compulsion to pull out her hair follicles, where I was introduced to Trichotillomania. 

So for maybe the past 4 years or so I've had a grown a bad habit of rubbing specific areas of the top of my scalp. It feels like a itchy-dry spot but it's really just because it's where the waves of my hair change course. Never the less, I can't stop rubbing or lightly scratching these areas when im anxious/thinking/concentrating. When I was younger I also had a really long habit of curling/twirling my hairs into knots, which eventually I grew out of, but maybe it's formed into this.

 I know this condition is specified to ripping out hair, but could other similar OCD conditions be applied to my situation?"
1133,Accessible therapy/counseling?,"I'm beginning to think I would benefit from therapy and/or counseling (Are they the same thing? I'm pretty sure they are). However, I can't pay for anything because I'm 16 and my parents would definitely not pay lol. Also how exactly would it work rn bc of corona and everything? For context, I live in the USA. Does anyone know of anywhere I could get free, virtual counseling?"
1134,Struggling to speak with a doctor about issues,"I am not diagnosed with bipolar but due to things that have happened over the past few years I have been trying to get myself to talk to a doctor. 

I am wondering if being diagnosed with something like this might appear on any kind of public records or background checks? Does it prevent you from purchasing or owning firearms? (I am located in the United States) Does it cause significant increases to insurance rates? Legal repercussions of any kind?

Also, is there any way to tell if my potential symptoms are real or made up? I have behaved in ways that seem to fit multiple warning symptoms and others have pointed some of these things out to me. I just feel like after reading symptoms and thinking “uh oh, this is relevant” that I made myself act more that way. Like a confirmation bias. And I feel that is very dangerous because psychiatry is heavily reliant upon self reported symptoms. I either hurt myself by treating a condition I don’t even have, or I hurt myself by not treating a condition that I really do have."
1135,PANIC DISORDER,"So, I’m September of 2018 I went through the absolute worst time in my entire life. I don’t really know what the hell it was, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t think straight, I couldn’t be happy, I damn near dropped out of school. I was fortunate enough at the time where I was living with my boyfriend whose family was paying for all of our bills so I didn’t have to worry about paying for anything. Fast forward to now and we broke up about a year ago, and I actually am living my current boyfriend, but he doesn’t have money, and we both work at the same place actually. We just got a place and everything was amazing. But the panic has come back. Now I have had anxiety and panic attacks since then, but I feel exactly the way I felt back then. It’s extremely difficult for me to sleep, if I can at all. It’s extremely difficult for me to feel normal at all, and it’s really hard to be happy. In fact I’m suicidal when this feeling happens, because it’s so relentless and won’t go away. I have to work in 4 hours and I’m freaking out about sleep. I want to kill myself. I hate having this. I never though it would come back. Please freaking help in any way!"
1136,My mom is schizophrenic!,"Hi! I'm 26(F) living in a moderate open-minded society, where people are aware of mental diseases but still don't know how to act around them. Not that they are negative about it. But they steer clear from such people as if it's a contagious disease which hurts alot. My mom has been diagnosed with schizophrenia paranoid. She have been showing it's symptoms for many years but as our society was not very aware of mental diseases up untill recently, it took many many years to know about the diagnosis let alone treatment. She is 46 and reluctant to get any treatment because she doesn't believe she needs it. Call it lack of education or awareness, for her to even understand that whatever she is feeling and dealing with can be helped through medicines is very difficult. It's been 6 years now from her diagnosis and without any treatment despite of my family trying our best to get her treated. My familyhave now accepted the fact that she might never take any help and would always live in the fear. It affects my family on day to day basis. But now it's affecting me a lot. I don't why I can't come to the acceptance her situation. I have talked to the doctors and always got the same answer ""you can't help her unless she wants to help herself"" Which always makes me feel helpless. I love her and want to help her but always come with no solution. She has changed alot, as if she has become a totally different person. I hate to see my mom becoming somebody whom I don't recognize, relate or to have any kind of relationship. I sometimes miss her desperately even when she is in the same house."
1137,Hear me out,"Good day to everyone.

I just want to tell you what I'm feeling, and hopefully you can hear me out. This won't be that long and I hope you stand by.

I was a psychology student graduate, so I have some  knowledge about mental health problems. As I assess myself, I have two underlying problem. First is FEAR and the other one is DELUSION. 

My first story is about me training for mixed martial arts with my friends, and as a beginner you will need sparring to enhance your skills. My very first sparring was my mind felt like I was beat up bad even when my friend barely touched me with his gloves. And me same to him, I didn't execute anything. After that everything changes. I get away from trainings to gyms and make excuses and I'll do everything to stay away from him. Time past by and I challenge myself to train again and I did well. I did well in sparring even they are pro fighters and Im not. I throw some good exchanges with my other sparring partners, I hurt them they hurt me. The problem is until now my mind never forget my first sparring and continue to evade the specific person even some of my sparring partners hit me well than him. It makes me anxious, clouded mind and afraid. 

My second story is that I always have this automatic thoughts of every male strangers is my enemy. When I walk them through streets my heart always pound fast and it's like 'Fight or Flight' mode. The backstory about this is my girlfriend was been harrased in public while he was with me and I didnt know about it then I made sure that I will protect her THAT'S WHY I TRAINED FOR MIXED MARTIAL ARTS but worse thing happened for my mental health. 

What are your thoughts? I need to hear you out. It's been around 2016-2017 and I'm still living through this hell. Any opinions are welcome.

Thank you."
1138,I don't feel good.,I don't feel good seems to be the only way I can describe how I have been feeling lately. I have an empty feeling in my stomach and I don't want to live anymore. My life is not bad things are finally looking in a positive direction for me after a good while of shit choices. This is taking a toll on my relationship and the last thing I want is my boyfriend to leave me. I love him greatly he is a positive roll in my life. But these mood swings they are so unpredictable lately. I can't afford to be hospitalized again but I know that would be my best option. I can't fall back asleep  I woke up with a rage in my belly that I fell asleep with last night. Why? Why did I have to wake up feeling the same way? I don't want to do this anymore guys. I don't feel good .
1139,Help,"I've lost myself. I don't know who I am. I've been fine for so long. Depression never goes away. I was fine I don't know what happened to me. Nobody is here for me and I understand people go through their own but I deserve attention, don't I? I'm so tired of living like this. I just want to be happy. Maybe I'm just overthinking. Do you ever feel like you're not here but you are here? me."
1140,I need help with medical bills (asking for advice),"Hey, I was hospitalized in March 10-17 after a depressive episode (yay bipolar 1) I currently owe over. 2,000 I medical bills and I don’t even know where to start. I’m a full time student so I just don’t have the money.

Any advice ?"
1141,"Can’t do my schoolwork, guilty, demotivated, frustrated","Background:
Since the end of 5th grade, I’ve had trouble doing schoolwork. It began when I zoned out for 10-20 minutes during a geography lesson and missed some important information about rivers that was part of an index card-based project. I had never zoned out like this before and didn’t give it much thought. When asked why I wasn’t doing the project, I (who was very socially awkward) didn’t say anything. I didn’t feel comfortable asking about what I had missed. I begin zoning out in every class, frequently. My grades went down and I felt really bad about it. To cope with this, I stopped caring. In 6th grade, I didn’t do any work as a result of an absence of focus and no motivation. It continued and still is today. 

This year (I’m a freshman in high school) I’ve really been trying to improve my ability to focus and get my schoolwork done but there’s always something in my mind holding me back. Sometimes I can’t concentrate and spend hours doing everything other than schoolwork, sometimes I get frustrated at the amount I have left (which grows the more frustrated I get, creating a feedback loop), and other times I can’t make myself continue doing an assignment because the amount of work left on just that single assignment overwhelms me. 

Occasionally I can finish one or even two assignments in a day, but then I’m exhausted and waste the next day doing nothing. I am assigned about 3-4 things to do per day, so obviously this isn’t sustainable.

I feel guilty because part of me thinks that I’m holding myself back because I’m lazy, but the other part of me is saying that maybe there’s something else going on. I also feel guilty because everyone tells me I’m extremely smart and my scores prove it, and whenever I hear that or am reminded of it I feel like a waste of intelligence. This demotivates me and I end up sitting in my chair ruminating about my negative qualities.

There was one day I woke up and looked at my assignments. I cried a lot trying to do the first one and eventually stopped crying and started doing it. Throughout the course of the assignment, I cried a few more times. After that, I started doing very well and I managed to complete 8 assignments by 4 pm, but my brother wanted me to help him unload a U-Haul and build a wall in his new residence. I didn’t want to go at all because I was doing so much work and could go on for a while, but my father made me. 

Since that day I’ve performed even worse than usual. All of my work is due on June 12th and the days are slipping by so fast because I’m just distracting myself from my work instead of going back to it and feeling bad.

A third perspective and/or words of encouragement would help a lot. Also, any idea why I cried that one day?"
1142,It's so hard for me to cry or even shed a tear no matter if I'm alone or with somebody else," It has always been like that (F23) and there's a certain context to it so I understand why I'm like that but I always feel uncomfortable in front of people if something is really sad and everybody's crying (real life situations, movies, tough stories) and they look at me and I just can't cry.

I mean, whenever everybody else is crying I don't feel well and I feel like everything's in my throat and I can feel my chest burning but I can't open up to people just like that and say what's the reason for it. They always look at me in a weird way, expecting me to cry with them and I simply can't. I feel like they are analyzing that in their heads trying to find a proper answer or a reason why I'm not crying. Especially because I'm a female and it would be somehow 'normal or expected' for boys not to cry, which is a terrible way of thinking about emotions.

Last time I really cried was back in 2017 when I lost my friend in a car accident and that was the first time my friends and other people saw me crying.

I just had to get it off my chest because many times I wish I could sit and cry my eyes out but I can't. I know there are people like me who will get this and since I can't talk about this with anybody else, I just want to shout out to you. In my country we have a beautiful song that says: *Crying without tears hurts terribly.*"
1143,I shouldn't feel like this.,"How I feel is difficult to explain but here is my best shot.

There are very few people I would trade my life for. I have a good career, above average looks, am well traveled, acceptable social life for a thirty year old in a medium sized town. I live every day doing pretty much anything I want. 

Yet.....

I feel totally disconnected from life. It's hard to describe but it's like a feeling of not being in control. Like life is pushing you in a certain direction. Although I have friends and family, I feel like I am acting. All the time. And that not only does no one really understand what's going on behind the scenes but, would they even care? Are they doing the same thing I'm doing to them to me? Are we all trying to pretend to be a certain thing around certain people at certain times? The seeming total disconnect from other people gives me an overwhelming sense of loneliness, sadness, and a feeling of nihilism. 

I have randomly decided quit jobs and travel for several weeks to months at a time. I have taken on new activities of rock climbing, and aggressively skiing. And I've been in love. I am aware of the intense anxiety of being in a totally new country, the fear of climbing, the adrenaline of a dangerous ski run, the love in a romantic relationship, but it's like it's not real. It's like a small feeling of control that occurs for a brief moment then fades away into meaninglessness. 


Thanks for hearing me out. Glad this community is out here."
1144,"Observing thoughts, and more","Hi everyone,
 Around three to four months ago I started meditating. Now I feel as if I am observing my thoughts ALL THE TIME. It’s like I’m getting lost in thoughts. 
 After months of fighting with my parents my mom told me that I was “schizophrenic.” I didn’t believe in it at first. I had seen therapists before, a few times. One therapist told me that I could have OCD, but I wasn’t diagnosed. I do check locks, or before going to sleep, I used to touch the empty plug to make sure there was nothing plugged in. The latter must have happened after I had watched a video on OCD patients. I may had been influenced by that, I don’t know. 
 When my mom told me that I was schizophrenic, I saw a therapist. He said I had major depressive disorder. But I must have misinformed him about my situation by using big words or something, I don’t know. I mean I did cry more than ten times in a month, (I had a period in my life where I didn’t cry a single tear for A YEAR) and felt generally bad. I remember back in February I sat on the school stairs. I felt so alone, like I had never felt before. I also told the therapist about a few nightmares I had. I think I had one or two nightmares between June 2019 and March 2020. Back in summer I had a nightmare where my cat fell down the window and I was screaming “HELP” as the sky was dark red. I had eaten lots of sugary foods before falling asleep that night. And I had also slept late. 
 So after my mom told me that I was schizophrenic, I checked online for schizophrenia. I used to check ocd or anxiety symptoms, but it was not that prominent in my life. I think after checking online for schizophrenia symptoms, I got into a rabbit hole where I became OBSESSED (underlined, bold, a million fucking points) with mental health, psychology, mood, thinking, thoughts... I then started meditation, I remember searching on YouTube for “meditation for emotional healing.”
 After meditation I also became very focused on my breath. I breathe so loud now. I used to breathe deep when I used to feel anxious, now I take deep breaths very, very frequently. 
  After my mom called me schizophrenic, I also started to self diagnose myself, or check for symptoms that are related to schizophrenia. I became very focused in sounds around me. I think there was a construction that day at my school, or something, I don’t remember well. But there was a sound. I asked my classmate if she heard the same sound that I heard, I asked “do you hear that sound or am I the only one?” She said “Yes, I heard that too.”
 I also became obsessed with my mood. I was watching my mood all the time. I didn’t take the antidepressants. It’s like I was this mood-hunter, where I chased happiness, and googled “happiness,” and mood, etc. I wanted to fix depression if there was depression, so I ran, stayed away from stress, tried to eat well etc. but it wasn’t me. 
 I also believed that what we said would change reality. Which I think it’s false now. I thought I was rewiring my brain, or changing my set of thoughts. I tried affirmations. I used to repeat affirmations to myself to fix myself after fights with my parents."
1145,Is this Tourette’s?,"Not sure if this is the right community for it but I wanna know. I never thought it was torettes before because I thought TS was only shouting things. 

But I found out it’s also other things, shoulder shrugging was one the website mentioned which I have. I’ve always felt weird urges to shrug, or twitch my eye to or nose because it’s like an itch, like my muscles are itchy and I need to stretch them or something. It’s pretty annoying and sometimes I constantly feel like I need to do it, which probably looks weird. It’s not out of my control, it’s like scratching an itch. Some days it’s not bad tho. Is that torrets, for those who have it? Or what would it be?"
1146,I want something to be wrong with me.,"This sounds really bad, but I don't think it's for attention. I just feel terrible a lot of the time and it feels like this can't be something that people just deal with everyday. TW for stuff like self harming, food issues, pedophilia, general stuff. This is just going to be a massive list of things that might have screwed me up so feel free to skip around. I've seen a therapist, I've seen school counsellors, and I've done some online counselling, but after a few sessions I feel better after venting and then I give myself time and then I get worse again. I feel too scared to go back and tell them. 

A lot of not so great stuff has happened in my relatively short life. The priest who did my confirmation was a p\*dophile (although he never did anything to me or my family, and we found out a few weeks after he left our church. The news did use a photo from my confirmation though.) My grandma had a stroke on a plane and my dad was away a lot to see her in Hong Kong. To get her home took a lot of resources and she died shortly after. I honestly don't know how these things have affected me, sometimes I feel bad because I don't think I actually mourned properly.

I used to scratch myself with a pin when I had a major breakdown, but now I do it because it's generally calming. Sometimes I feel bad, but the other day I actually got an amazing result on a test and did it anyway. I've preplanned it, like in the middle of the day I unscrewed the blade from a sharpener and kept it for that night instead of it being a spontaneous decision. I don't think I'm actually properly hurting myself, because it's not deep and there's no scars. (Although they are just scabs right now so I guess there's time.) I'm not really suicidal, I want to die but I'm not going to put effort into it at the moment. Sometimes I think about dying in my sleep, but most methods seem too painful or ineffective to try.

The other day my mum had a bad time and called a friend (I think, I'm not sure) about how me and my brothers were being raised selfish and lazy. I think I'm dealing with that, mostly by writing my graduation speech where I turn that around in my head, but it might have set off a lot of the stuff that happened. My two brothers have had ADHD tests, one is on medication for it and I'm not sure about the other (that sounds bad, but he's in year 8 and it's up to him if he wants me to know about it). Two of my uncles have epilepsy, one I used to see every week and we are quite close.

I thought I might have had social anxiety or something similar because I couldn't talk to strangers if I was by myself. I can't ask things of people on public transport, I overthink where I can sit. It's not severely affecting me at the moment, just bouts of fear of doing something wrong or not following some unwritten rule, but I still take public transport everyday after school.

I'm sort of questioning my sexuality, I'm pretty sure I'm sexually attracted to both men and women, but I don't think I've ever had a crush. I had a girlfriend for a while but that was just us both trying something new and it never got serious. I don't know what love towards someone feels like, and I don't know if I've felt it and just didn't realise. Or just overreacting.

Now some random bits and pieces that might be of importance. I sleep in a nest and like layering blankets like a weight. I run around the house because my head gets too full. When in social situations I get drained easily and often start creating fanfic in my head of characters in my position (this often overtakes the situation, like I will actively switch off to think. I regret this a lot.) I'm turning 18 in less than a month and I'm terrified of the future. I know our family is okay, but also not in the best position money-wise, we go on holidays to visit family every 2 years or so but I'm still worried about bills going up. I eat regularly, but will often ignore if I'm hungry or if I know I'm not quite eating enough, I'm fine with my weight and body (I actually enjoy it more than other physical aspects of myself).

Anyway, thank you for sticking to the end. The main thing I'm asking I guess is if there might be something wrong, because I feel like I'm overreacting or exaggerating sometimes, but I do have good days, just not the majority. Thank you!"
1147,Really worried,"I think I’ve been here posting about it before but I’m honestly scared now. Throughout the last six months my boyfriend 28m and I 25f have been renting with housemates. I was already worried as it wasn’t planned to be share housing. We moved out so we could move in to a place just for us but instead we made a move for an in between. I have a neurological condition called Misophonia. Since I was 14 when I came to telling my family and putting a name to the condition, it’s been a serious struggle with eating with my family let alone my bf. The condition not only puts strain on me but also on him and everyone else close to me. As I get agitated easily with it. Making anything with sounds and visual to do with food and restaurants difficult. I’ve gotten to a point where I am off my meds as I’ve needed to change them. And I haven’t seen my psych for months, half a year at least. I’m thankful that I can go and see her in another week from now, however I would not be surprised if my partner wants to separate. We’ve struggled with my condition before but right now since I asked him quietly at dinner to ‘be aware, I’m not dealing too well right now, this might sound sharp’ and it did, he doesn’t want to see my face he wants me to go away from him for at least a few hours. I already struggle with anxiety but my partner is I think past breaking point and has clearly had enough of me right now. I’m just wondering what more I can do as I’m numb right now and at a loss as for what I could possibly do. I cannot right more wrongs when I said I was doing my best to improve. When I haven’t, sadly. We’re supposed to be moving out again together as the housemates situation was not working out. They’re not happy with our effort’s. I’m always trying to fix things but I think this is long gone. I don’t know what I can do. I have no control over the bf, I have mistakenly put pressures on him unintentionally expecting him to comply consistently. No one can. That’s horrible and I feel like I’m a fuck up."
1148,I dont know what I want in life,"
I've been meaning to post about this on reddit for some time but I couldnt find the words to describe how I feel but I will give it my best shot. Putting my life in words is not easy so please bare with me and help me.

I have never been able to figure out what I WANT. I just do what feels FUN at the moment. When I was young, I played many sports but never fully COMMITED to one so I never got really good at any. Just an guy who knows many sports (all rounder). This also has carried on to school and now college. 
I do what feels GOOD at the moment. Most of the time, what makes me feel good is usually something that is a short term reward. The things that make me feel good right now are: anime, tv shows, video games, food. For example, I could motivate myself to study by telling myself I will order a burger or watch an anime if I finish studying. In other orders, I am not thinking about anything else when I do these things that I enjoy, I am merely doing them for pleasure. I could go out with friends (thats a lie, I only have one friend) just to feel that I have done something different and not to feel like a hermit when I binge watch. 

Praying, Studying, Friends, etc. are just there to make not feel guilty about doing the thing I enjoy which is their only purpose to me. If they lose that purpose they are pointless. For example, I am watching anime right now while I have final exams and I have no guilt for skipping 3 exams. 

I dont know what I am supposed to do in life but I know that this isnt healthy. I thought about this many times and came up with potential solutions. You know how many times that was? Literally over 100 times. I have broken promises to myslef to CHANGE so many times that I dont trust myself anymore. I have sought help because people may belittle my problems and tell me to ""man up"" ""others have bigger problems"" ""you are just lazy but with excuses"". Men dont talk about mental problems where I am from.

Please, I just need your opinions on what I should do. Feel free to ask for additonal information. 

Thank you"
1149,My Life Recently is Constant Worrying and Despair and I Need Advice Please,"? Possible just incase TW: Abuse, Anxiety, Medication, Worries, Distressed, Suicide

A apologise in advanced for the poor gramma, possible spelling mistakes and the long paragraphs. I just really want to get this off my chest anonymously and gain some sort of advice. This is longer than expected but it outlines almost my life and the first time I’ve been truthful about it. I’m not in my twenties yet but I really want to change before I am.

Firstly, a bit of background and context. I am currently a university student, in England, studying to go into the medical field but don’t quite want to go into details on what profession it may be. I recently only got diagnosed with Adult ADHD Combined Type with Generalised Anxiety, Social anxiety and emotional dysregulation associated with ADHD. I’m still quite young, that being a teenager and I know I have my whole life ahead of me but for most of my life, different situations and circumstances were never normal for me. At school i always got away with doing things, not turning up to lessons, poor behaviour, messing around in class and distracting others. I was with Camhs quite a bit but never had a diagnosis for anything. But, I was still top set in every subject. Despite all this, I still got quite good/decent grades and went to college. In college, pretty much the same, messed around, lazy but again, reworded friends assignments etc and got 100% after the two years. I then started university and just finishing my first year in about a months time. My childhood was abusive, I was abused physically and verbally at home, I was bullied at school but at the same time I was well known and popular. People wanted to hang with me at times and other times they didn’t. I had loads of friends but didn’t at the same time. I had such a different experience to life as some people and it’s hard to explain. 

University has been challenging as it was a complete reality shock. I found literally trying to survive a lot harder on my own than others. Cooking, washing clothes, managing my time, studying and generally trying to sustain life in general has been extremely difficult and I could never explain it to anyone until I got a diagnoses of ADHD and started medication which has help in some aspect. I had to use my student loan to seek the diagnoses from a private psychiatry service because the waiting list would’ve been two years. 

During University, I had a period where I was taking street benzodiazepines and got to a very low point in my life where I attempted to overdose multiple times on these benzos but again, after a few days, I did not feel as if I wanted to even do that and felt completely fine. I have attempted a few times previously and the same, I felt completely different after a few days. No one really believed that and said it was unusual so there’s another reason why my life is just not typical or normal. I was sent home from uni but continued online learning with the rest of the cohort as corona virus pandemic occurred and it didn’t make much difference. I am struggling SO hard with the remote work and lectures, even though I am receiving help etc. Nothing is working, my brain is just not processing anything as if my brains CPU has just slowed down significantly. 

People have always told me to speak to my family etc for help but being home has been the worst. I have NEVER been close to my family and I don’t think I ever will be. I never speak to them, I feel awkward speaking to my family; my mother especially. Since being home, (Roughly 10 weeks ago) I have stopped the benzodiazepines but I feel as if that has contributed to constant day for day anxiety. My anxiety is related to health issues and friends and how others judge me. I constantly feel as if I have something wrong with my health and that leads to me doing hours of research and googling symptoms hoping to find an answer to relieve me knowing i’m fine but as you know, it will always state the worst case scenario. I know this but I still do it because I want an answer and it’s never the answer that I want. 

On top of all of this, a healthcare job that i used to work for over a two years ago has just dismissed me for gross misconduct. I was in inpatient briefly because I smoked cannabis and it exacerbated my paranoia and feelings at the time. I had gone to work after, which i knew i shouldn’t have, and when I came back I was tested positive for THC on the day I worked. This was because THC lasts such a long time and I had not smoked or been under the influence whilst working. They believed me when I said this but because if anything happened to someone at work and i tested positive, it would have been a legal issue. This now plays on my mind on how it will affect me in the future when applying to my regulatory body for my profession. I rang a solicitor and my course lead at university and councillors and they all believe that it will be okay but it still plays on my mind as if I have completely messed up my life. 

Recently (last three months maybe) I have been so cautious on what people may think about me, are they really wanting me to be here? Why am i always the third person in the corridor behind them? Why does no one pay attention to my questions when I ask in our uni groupchat? Why am I always last to be invited or even never? I almost NEVER call my friend but they call me because I just fear that rejection. It is ruining my life and I have tried meditation everyday, tried noting and mindfulness, tried to change myself. I have never had that one best friend and I have no idea what the hell is wrong with me. I feel as if recently i struggle to talk to people, I stutter my words, I have difficulty phrasing things unless I am writing them down. My reading and writing have become so bad. 

I woke up this morning thinking the world is falling apart and so is my life. There’s a global pandemic, there are multiple riots and students all over the country are devastated and outraged by how they are proceeding with teachings. 

I don’t have anyone, I don’t speak to my family, my friends back at home don’t want to hang around with my and my university friends don’t talk to me, they prefer other people since I have became riddled with this anxiety and I believe it might be because I am constant worrying about my health in some aspect or my mental health or judgement from others. I am due to have an assessment for therapy again but I can’t even think of how to explain what I need help with or how it can help! 

I kind of want some sort of advice and if anyone is willing to read this to see what I actually need help with and mention to a professional again because I don’t even know what’s wrong, even though I have briefly explained my life story. Even right now, my memory is HORRENDOUS and I can’t even remember what I wrote so writing the TL;DR will consist of me going back and forth reading what I’ve wrote and condensing it. 

I really just want everything to go back to a time where I did not care so much, was briefly happy for a while, had some friends. Didn’t worry constantly about judgement (even if the things i was doing is normal), I wasn’t so afraid of saying no to people and I want to change. I want to be able to not fear rejection, I want to not constantly focus on negatives and I want to be a normal person. I am in a social awkwardness hole and it’s filling up with thoughts of past regrets, previous wrong doings, fear, worries, financial struggles and loneliness. 

Any advice would be appreciated so much❤️

TL;DR: My life has been completely different to others. I have ADHD-Combined, social anxiety, generalised anxiety and emotional dysregulation. I take medication which helps when active slightly with productivity. I constantly worry about my health and how others judge me. I have no one, not even my family, never been close to my family. I do receive professional help but they don’t work. I have an assessment for therapy soon but don’t even know what’s wrong or how to explain what’s wrong. I feel awkward asking for help. I need some advice. My life has turned for the worst and I think it may have been to do with the time I was taking high amounts of benzodiazepines and have damaged my brain. My life is basically a lie and I just want to go back to being happy and not caring/worrying so much again. I am a mess. My experience with life has been so different to others and it’s hard to explain."
1150,I made this account 1 year ago to post here about how crap I was feeling on my birthday..,"Exactly one year on, and about 6 weeks after starting antidepressants i feel like the sun has come out!

almost everyone forgot until I after 8pm when I posted about it on Facebook and I’ve had a sudden guilty rush of messages, but I don’t care, I feel like people love me every day.  I’ve had a lovely day, there was cake, and I’m looking forward to a nice weekend seeing my mum and dad for the first time in months!!"
1151,"I want to be a better person but i don't know what to do about it, please help","This is my first time posting here and i don't know if this really belongs here but i have a hard time finding more specific subreddit for my vent. I know that other people here might have more serious problems but i just need to write about it somewhere and i have a hard time telling this to people in my life. 
I have incredibly low self esteem, i cry a lot and cannot control it. Im anxious and afraid of everything and on top of that im introverted and really bad at communicating with other people.
So naturally many things don't come as easy to me as to other people. Even though i am quite successful academically, in real life outside of school im completely useless.
Many people in my life have noticed this and clearly want to help me but i just feel like that their advice in not getting me anywhere. I just don't get how advice like 'just believe in yourself more!!' or 'don't be so afraid' or 'just be more assertive and decisive' is supposed to get me anywhere if anxiety and sensitivity is just how i react to things and have almost no control over that.
I would really like to get better at these things and i know that its me who has to do the work but i just don't know where to start because its not like i can just change my personality in a matter of days.
I just feel like such a burden to everyone around me and sometimes i feel like it would be better if i just didn't exist at all and saved everyone the trouble."
1152,Identity crisis,"I don't know what to do, this has happened before a few months ago but it feels worse now.

It starts with thinking about a recent mistake (last post if you want to read more) and feeling ashamed intensely, and I'll go down a shame spiral and remember every mistake I've made and who I used to be and hate it. I have changed a lot but I used to think lying was more okay and gossip behind people's back, but I don't even know who I am or what I stand for anymore.

I had a problem with drinking and getting blackout drunk and have said nasty things to people I love on a few occasions, I have apologised profusely to all of those people but now I am thinking back and wondering if I did other fucked up things while blackout drunk and I just don't remember them.

I don't know how to forgive myself and I managed to bury it for months but now all the obsessive ruminating thoughts are back, and they are my fault.

I have a really nice life and don't think I deserve it, I have tried to help people and change who I am and I am still messing up and bowing to peer pressure or avoiding confrontation at 22. I can't help but compare myself and feel I have done worse things than others even though I don't judge them as harshly.

I find it hard to take compliments because I don't think I'm lovely and don't think it's true.

I really don't want to worry my boyfriend and feel bad for making it about me when so much is going on in the world. He doesn't know that I've hardly eaten these past 5 days either, don't understand why I'm not but I just don't have the motivation to do much because there isn't much to do. Feel quite disgusted even more that I'm just wallowing in my self-pity and it's not helping anyone."
1153,It is ok to feel like a confused shitty hopeless loser without any meaning in life sometimes,"Hello guys, I am writing this post because I read a lot of posts from people feeling badly, hopeless, as losers, without any purpose in life or with the feeling of being out of control.
At first I would like to tell you that it is ok to feel like this sometimes.
Life is not like in the movies and it is full of challenges, difficult times, wrong choices, bad attitude, down moments, mistakes and laziness.
We are not all the same, we do not follow the same paths or rules and there are no assured steps that can be done to avoid suffering in life or mistakes. Most of us are not brilliant successful entrepreneurs with excellent curricula,genius ideas,wonderful friends and a perfect family always laughing and having fun.
Actually I do not know anybody with a perfect life and perfect people around.
Most of us are just ordinary people that are facing everyday life  step by step and trying to make ends meet with some creativity.
Now, you need to acknowledge that you are not different from anybody else and you deserve to forgive yourself, to feel better and reach out for happiness. You are capable to make your life better as anybody else.
We all have down moments to reset our lives and gain new energies and many of us need help to face those moments and to deal with what our brain is making us to think and feel.
Sometimes you feel being in this deep down dark hole without any exit:please just breath and cry, you cannot believe it because is not what you are feeling but there is a way out.
What you can do about it?
At first reach out for help, if you can afford mental health services contact them, if you cannot you need to contact the suicidal helpdesk in your country,it is extremely important to get professional help to identify the exact problem and what you need to do in order to face it, contact also the people you can really trust (your family or friends) , do not be ashamed or afraid of scaring them or to disappoint them, ask them for help, speak frankly and openly about how you feel, start to help yourself with art, sport and creativity:draw,sing,write,play music,listen to music,do sports, write on reddit if it helps you, if you can or just have a walk, take your time to reflect but do not isolate yourself, involve yourself in community activities with others.
I know that you can feel totally desperate and that is why you need to give yourself a chance and take action!
I am not a doctor and my purpose is just trying to give you some strength and courage to activate yourself.

1154,Manipulation,"Growing up, my mother would make me feel manipulative for expressing feelings, be it sadness or even joy. 

By the time I hit puberty I had been diagnosed with bipolar. This was later rediagnosed as TL Epilepsy. The mood swings made it hard to diagnose I guess. But really it had instilled this fear that what I felt was invalid. It was a chemical imbalance. I've been unable to open up to people on a deeper level, have relationships, fearing that I'm manipulating them into my life, all followed by deep guilt and shame for what I feel. 

Around 17 my mom was diagnosed with BPD so what was perhaps gaslighting on her side is almost justified by her personality disorder. 

I can't open up to people. Even now writing this it's heavy hearted and filled with shame. I get to be anonymous. 

The guy I really like and have gotten to know, I can't open up to and I know I'm pushing away. He thinks I'm covered in red flags. I don't know if he's joking. I don't know how to tell him that I'm really scared to tell him how I feel because my feelings are accompanied with me also feeling like I'm manipulating him, and then with that guilt. Like I'm tricking him into being with me. 

The rational side of me knows its not true. The side of me, that scared little girl, still hears her moms voice telling her to stop being so manipulative."
1155,i cant do this anymore,"i had an appointment with a psychiatrist yesterday that was purely for diagnosis - i have been in therapy for about 8 years but it stopped helping - i don’t know this man i just met him yesterday so i tried my best opening up to a stranger. everytime i told him how i felt he dismissed it with the flick of his hand and kept telling me “oh that’s nothing” and proceeded to laugh.
ive never had a proper diagnosis before as my therapist refused to. i feel like shit. i constantly need validation about my feelings, my parents constantly keep telling me that i have nothing and im just lazy but i cant do anything anymore, ive self harmed, ive made plans to kill myself, i’m anxious to go out or do just about anything. i mean i started having a panic attack when i couldn’t find a shirt. i’ve been constantly like this for the past two years - i cant do this anymore. anyways, his diagnosis was social anxiety and obsessive thoughts. i just felt really bad about myself and i feel like utter shit. why am i feeling like this ??? there’s absolutely no reason, a frigging doctor confirmed it for god’s sake......."
1156,"I’m a US Marine, but it really doesn’t feel that way.","Hey everyone, now for starters I’m not posting this because I want pitty, this isn’t about “oh I’m sad please give me attention” but I just want to see if anyone else feels similar, and maybe if someone can maybe help me.

I’m a 20 y/o US Marine who works a “POG” job. (For those of you not enlisted it means “Position Other than Grunt” where “grunt” meaning infantry, boots on the ground killing terrorists kinda stuff) 

If you looked at me on paper (which is how 85% of the Marine Corps sees you) I’m a pretty good Marine. I’ve got goods Proficiency and Conduct scores, I’m good at my job according to my leadership, I’m just starting college courses, I have over 200 volunteer hours this year alone, I’ve been working to get certifications, I have high first class Physical and Combat fitness test scores.

Everything apart from my Rifle Score, which stands at 250 (the lowest passing score) because I didn’t qualify twice, barely making it in bootcamp. 

Apart from my poor marksmanship (literally, for you marines) it appears I’m great. My Staff Sergeant is even having me go on a meritorious promotion board for Corporal. Hell, one of the Gunnery Sergeants in my unit refers to me as “Future Sergeant Major”.

Regardless of all of that I don’t feel like I deserve the patch I wear on my chest. “U.S. Marine”. I don’t fee l like I’m good at my job, because every week I mess something up. Even though I have volunteer hours all I did was coach a few kids. 

It’s more than just feeling like I don’t deserve this stuff, whenever I’m not at work I just crash, I just feel really depressed for no real reason, usually alcohol or nicotine helps that (I’m a lightweight so a 3 beers will have me good) but recently it’s not been distracting me. Had to leave a party while drunk a few weeks ago just because I couldn’t pretend anymore. Hell im drinking a beer as I type this. 

It usually starts with me judging myself, I think back to how I can’t shoot, or how I messed up this week, or whatever, then it turns to tears, with a roommate I can’t really do that, so I hold them back, that’s when the internal screaming starts, it’s almost like I’m not in control of my own mind sometimes. It’s to the point where hobbies that used to light up my eyes and make me lose myself feel just so numb.

Maybe it’s just burnout, I’ve heard a lot about that. I’ve been looking around and I’ve heard things about imposter syndrome and high functioning depression, which maybe I fit the billet for.

The thing is, if to everyone else I’m do great, then maybe I don’t need to get help, really part of being a Marine is putting others before yourself, so as long as I can get up, do my job and then some, why should I worry. As long as I do what I’m told, when I’m told, and still somehow go above and beyond, why should I stop. 

I’m sorry if this is really long, there’s a lot more to it, but I don’t want to drop my walls to the people who know me who think I’m some kinda legend. If anyone else feels this way, even if it’s not in the military sense please let me know, and tell me about how you handle it. Right now I’m doing fine, but the pressure is building and I cannot afford to snap. 

Thanks guys."
1157,Managing bipolar symptoms or disorder,"Im a 27 year old Male from Hawaii, USA. Bipolar disorder runs in the family on my dad's side, at least for 3 generations. I've been able to manage pretty well without medication despite having symptoms since I was 15. However, I find it increasingly difficult to manage. Some times I feel euphoric and creative and productive for weeks at a time, but other times I feel the opposite. I am a musician, and I am afraid medication might hinder my creative side, and I must admit that I relish in what might be called mania.

I would like to know from other people with the disorder, did getting on medication help? I would appreciate your personal anecdotes and experiences. Thank you"

1159,CAT scan/Consent to taking pills/Baker Act,"My girlfriend was been in the hospital for 2 days now. She disappeared with her car the night before going to the hospital and I was so worried so I called the police to find her(Im in a different city). She's been okay since yesterday but isnt released yet due to the Baker act. 

My main 3 concerns are:

She wants a CAT scan since she was assaulted, however she's worried about being held longer and shes thinking of doing the CAT scan after she's discharged.

Her doctor has not seen her not once before prescribing 4x the amount of her usual dose which is fucked up. Is that legal for a doctor to do? To prescribe without seeing  your patient?

Can she refuse to take the medication they are giving her? I dont want her in there any longer then needed and she's been okay to be released. We dont want them keeping her longer over  fucking pills. This is in Miami.


Take care of yoursleves and loves y'all"
1160,The one good thing therapy over the phone,Because of the pandemic my therapy is happening over the phone. Sometimes it's annoying because my therapist is very hard to hear sometimes and we can't read each others body language (which is somewhat important with me because I'm not the most talkative although i'm getting better) but I do have the pleasure of not having to go out in public after having therapeutically bawled my eyes out. These tear-stained cheeks are hidden from the world.
1161,Fix the killer/abuser mentality,"I'm 19, FtM, I've been diagnosed with BPD, clinical depression and severe anxiety (I don't know if any of these things matter). I have no idea how to name this but I feel like I need help. I've been dealing with this quite a while, I'm very interested in true crime as well as crime novels/comics whatever and whenever the killer/abuser has a troubled childhood or past I feel like if I've been there I could've helped them somehow, fixing them in some way, I would've be there for them. Most of these killers had some type of family issues or romantic issues and since I was raised in a toxic household I feel too much empathy towards them ignoring completely what they've done but I don't feel this way towards anyone who isn't a bad person for example any guy who has treated me badly I still want to be there for them and I romanticize being abused mentally and physically by them. I also have a weird view of how romance should be expressed; stalking, obsessing, jealousy and possessiveness are some ways I think it should be expressed towards me. But when someone I like gets mad at me I feel like I should apologize but I also feel like they should apologize to me. This is mainly my problem because I started dating more guys recently and I'm meeting a lot of people so I feel this type of mentality will affect my relationships but I don't know what else to do, I'm trying to get back into therapy but it's a bit difficult to have sessions online since I don't have much privacy. I'm not from the U.S so any services from there aren't available to me, thanks for reading."

1163,Trying to get help seems impossible.,"Unless you're in ""crisis"", it seems next to impossible to get any help.

I'm in Ontario, Canada. I've been to many of the crisis bullshit things, they are ok and help in the moment enough to get you out of your head enough that the urge to die subsides. But trying to find any long term help isn't as simple.

I feel like I'm just in cycle, repeating the same things, but getting no help. Where the only outcome is I'll succeed at some point and just die.

It was like pulling teeth with my GP just to get the meds I have now, but since I asked about a specialist she doesn't seem very interested in helping me, she just tells me I'm on s list. I've been waiting for years now, last time I saw her I asked and she just said she'll start it again. So I'm other words I'm SOL. I'm on disability, and alone, so trying to navigate the system is a little difficult for me. I can't even get my case worker to call me back to see if she could help or recommend anything.

Things just keep getting worse. And it seems like I'm only being left with one option to get any relief."
1164,Blues,"My mental health is pretty much non-existent. My days are blue. I don’t feel any motivation at all. I work and study and that’s all do. I have no friends, no family. My dad abandoned me ever since I was a 4-year-old. My mom was there, but she would fuck different guys every night and party all day. It was definitely not something that I wanted to see/know. We fought a lot. So I decided to move out. I live by myself and it’s very challenging, especially being 21 and in the middle of a global pandemic. I try very hard to feel good and appreciative for the things I have, but I can’t help it. I feel so lonely. I tried to make friends, put people don’t take me seriously. They just want to have a good time and then disappear. I just want the pain to go away, but it won’t. It’s chosen me. I smoke most days as a way to escape reality and feel something. I’d like to say my life is like a roller coaster. But no, because I’m never up, just deep down always. I think I’m a good person, but no one else can see that and it hurts, a lot. I have no one to talk to. I’m just all alone, and I always thought I could make it. I thought I could trust myself. But I just can’t. I’m afraid, empty, and destroyed. Can anybody hear me?"

1167,It feels like I have forgetting about something traumatic but I cant' say what,"Hi

It's my first post ever here on reddit, even though I read a lot of stories, but yeah, a bit nervous.

Also, English is not my mother tongue so I'm sorry if the grammar is all messed up.

I decided to write here today because I'm not really in a good place mentally speaking, which, honestly is fine and understandable with all the things that are happening in the world. I am used of having depressing episodes and I can usually deal with them. But every time I'm in a bad place I can't help but wondering if something happened in my life, something that would have caused all of that, but that I would have forget about. It's a thought that I began to have when I was in middle school, that somehow something went wrong when I was younger but my brain just erased it. I tried doing research on it but couldn't find anything at the time, didn't have any evidence and it felt like it was just something that I wanted to make my life easier (having a nice and neat example of a singular trauma that would just explain everything) so I dropped it.

But I have been talking to this new friend recently, and we were amazed to find that we had a lot in common especially about our childhood. Except this friend family is blatantly toxic where mine is fine. But she told me they were a lot of traumatic events that she forgot about until going in therapy so that it didn't feel like her family was that bad. So I was wondering if maybe it wasn't the same for me.

To be honest, a huge part of me doesn't believe that anything wrong happened to me but as I said this thought has been bugging me for years (I'm 21 now, it began around 11/12) so I thought that maybe having an external point of view would help me sorting things out.

First is a hella long introduction :

When I was around ten, my family decided to move out and my parents opened a restaurant in a small town. Me and my older brother were easy kids, we never caused any problems, were really calm and nice and good in class. When we moved out the family structure changed a lot, my parents suddenly didn't have time for us, they were stressed and exhausted all the time. A year after we moved out my brother who was 17 decided to continue his studies at the other end of the country and I basically found myself alone in this big, old and scary house (to this day I'm still convinced that it is haunted, but that's another story). Even thought I used to be a very extroverted child  I struggled making new friends, it was a very lonely time and I eventually turned out bitter, angry and eventually depressed. Things got a bit better when I entered high school (I know high school is view as being hell on earth, especially for american but were I live, we consider middle school to be the worse) and was in a boarding school two hours away from home. I tried to take this as a new opportunity to make friend (and I made plenty of them), and being happy again. But I was already deep down into depression and I realized I couldn't get myself out of it alone, so I decided to talk with my parents and to go and see a psychologue, and then a psychiatrist. They diagnosed me with depression (duh) but it always felt like an easy diagnosis, when I think about it I'm pretty sure I also had severe anxiety, eating disorders, OCD episodes, was constantly living in a daydream state (I later found out about maladaptive daydreaming) and I'm pretty sure I had visual hallucinations at a certain point (but again, could be that my house really is haunted). Anyway, with the help of professionals i started to get out of it, and after seven awful years I began a life without depression.

And then the problem :

Basically, when I picture my life before we moved, it's all happy moments and nice things. But when I look more into it they are a lot of weird things and I just don't know if they are normal (and I know normal is a hug word but... yeah). Moving out has messed me up pretty badly and I can accuse most of the thing I have today on this fact, but the more I think about it, the more it feels like it was an older problem.

So, some things that I don't know if they are weird or not (it all happened before I was ten) :

\- I never slept alone, since I am old enough to remember and even before that, I would always scream and cry until my parents let me sleep with them, when they became tired of it, they just made me sleep with my brother (who was really nice and didn't mind all this time)

\- when I was around six, I remember having a conversation with my mother, telling her I wished I could be reborn into a nice, rich family. They wasn't notion of wanting to die as far as I remember, but I clearly remember wanting to be reborn somewhere else. My mother talked about it with my father who became very angry/sad and told me that if I wanted to go I could. So in the middle of dinner, I just left. My father didn't think I would do it and run after me, I remember crying a lot that night. It's a very weird memory because I remember feeling a lot of negative emotions, but my parents forget about it until I brought it up when I was 16 and find this funny/cute.

\- I was a very nice kid, always polite and well behaved. But this one time there was this town party with little stands and everything, and a fifty something guy would announce things and talk about each stands. I don't know why, but I hated him so much, I never saw him before but his voice on the speaker would make me mad. I know that it asked me a question at a certain moment, and that I must have said something bad because the next thing I remember is being in the car with my father lecturing me while I was sobbing uncontrollably.

\- After we moved out I had pretty weird sexual dreams including my father but I just put that in the whole ""eodipian thing you have when you grow up"" box

and finally...

\- I had a pretty early sexual awakening. The first time i consciously masturbate was around five or six with a... very weird fantasy. I was sitting near a pool with old men smoking, and they used me as an ashtray. They weren't burning me or anything but it was really heavy in the shaming category. I began watching pornography around ten, and almost immediately started watching quite heavy stuff. Since then I almost always had a pretty messed up sexual life.

\- I had this friend, a neighborhood of mine, she was two years older than me and I used to sleep at her house pretty frequently. She would also came to my house pretty frequently, I don't know when or how it began, but we started having weird game. We would do catwalk that would end up in strip tease (she usually played the role of the man/boss). In another game, she pretended she was taking care of me and I had to seat on her lap, I don't remember much of this one but it's the one that gave me the strongest sickening feeling. In the most disturbing one, that I completely forgot about until recently, we would tie one of my baby doll on the swing, hurt it and call it names, the disturbing part (appart from the obvious) is that I remember feeling a mixture of awful/really excited and it was no doubt a sexual game. We also had sexual intercourse multiple times (I can remember two but might have been more). Most of the weird stuff happened at my house, but she would almost never sleep at mine. I was the one sleeping in her house, and when I did I only remember playing barbie and doing normal stuff. I don't know what to think about this. I don't remember who came up with all those things, and I don't remember being against it, but it feels very wrong and unhealthy now.

Also, after we moved out I refused to sleep over my friends house, but I don't know if it's related

There was several pedophilia related incident that happened when I grew up, it was a really small town, everyone new everyone but I somehow only learnt about it all when I was way older. Some of those incident included people I didn't know about, some of them included people really close to me.

&amp;#x200B;

That was... A very long first post. Sorry for that people.

I don't really know what to expect about it, but it's nice to know that I write it all out somewhere."
1168,What do I do? Nevermind. I worked it out. I hope.,"I've been falling behing in my uni work. I quit my job abruptly. Literally woke up that morning and decided 'nah'. I feel like shit. And again I've started thinking about killing myself.

I don't enjoy living but I'm not sad enough to kill myself. I just think about it every day and how nice it would be to just stop existing.

I'd like to get hit by a truck.

Or maybe have one of those magic 'one in a million' brain seizures that kill perfectly healthy people.

You've heard it all before on this subreddit. We all kind of want to die, so I won't write out my thoughts. I know you get it.

Anyway, today I decided to go to bed early to make tomorrow come faster. I'm in bed now, typing this on my phone. Tomorrow when the sun comes up I can start WORKING on this shit. I'm going to have a productive day. I always feel better after a productive day. I'm sick of feeling like shit.

But that won't drown those thoughts forever. Guys, how do I make these thoughts go away for good? How do I stop myself from wanting to die as soon as I slip up? I'm on antidepressants and they're amazing. But I think I need counselling for my thought pattern.

Ok.

I made up my mind. I'm going to call my uni and schedule a free appointment with the counsellors. Maybe they can help.

Thanks for reading."
1169,What is wrong with me?,Somedays it's like everything is okay but other there's something in my head telling me how things will go wrong. Something that always keeps me bothering. I can't sleep on those nights. I can't think rationally. All I can think of is how my life is gonna get fucked up
1170,Just sharing,"Hi there, 22, male, have OCD, psychotic disorder, suicidal ideation, 7 year long depression, been in 2 psychyatric wards since 2015, and had a schizofrenic break last autumn. Feeling like crap these days specially after monthly dose of meds. Feel stupid also. The doctors keep shoving shit up my system and guess what, slim to nought improvement. Been on about 9 different meds since 2015, 3 max at a time.
Fed up with it all. Now the newest shit my brain is playing on me is the restraint-needed urge to hurt people.
I get really aggressive when psychotic, and have been so; and well, money, that is another story haha.
Yeah just wanted to share. 
 
How are you guys/gals doing?
Take care everyone :)"
1171,How to cope up with loneliness?,"So I am not a social person. I have three close friends with whom I used share problems with. One of them is dealing with her own issues and need space to heal. The second one, she had become my 'centre', could understand me without me even saying anything and is always there. Kind of had become dependent on our friendship which was stupid of me but didn't relise until now. But we had a falling out and she has been ignoring me since and wouldn't talk to me even when I reached out (you can know the story if you want by reading my last post). The third friend, well he talks to me but as he is working doesn't really have time to talk all the time whenever I need to. 

So through all this my anxiety has risen tremendously. I haven't had a attack in a while which I am thankful for but  not a day passes by crying over loosing that friend and being lonely and not being able to talk to anyone. The loneliness is eating at me. 

I don't know how to deal with this situation. I don't know how to deal with one of my closest friend abandoning me."
1172,I can no longer find joy.,"Between my job outlook, my wife's job outlook, the endless barrage of bad news: I can no longer find joy or happiness. I'm angry and anxious and if I'm not, I'm just numb. I grieve for the life that was, full of adventure. I haven't left the corner of the city since March 15. 

Not sure what the next step is."
1173,Depression sucker punched me even though I'm doing great,"(I'm from France) 

A couple days ago my old depression just hit me all at once, although the only thing that changed was the fact that I took the last pill of my medication for the month (Concerta, pretty close to Aderall but not exactly the same, I have ADHD). 

My nutrition is really good, I workout daily for around an hour, I entirely stopped drinking and smoking recently (it wasn't an actual problem, I just felt like it was best) and I've been getting plenty enough sleep. 

 Now mark my word, I have no reason to be depressed. And it pisses me off so much that I am. I hate being negative and almost never am in my everyday life but I'm physically unable to feel or imagine anything good right now, although I'm doing great in almost every aspect. I'm not excited by anything.  

I just need an answer on why I sleep 11 hours a day, feel exhausted until I go to bed, and still get great performances when I workout. I don't feel like doing anything, don't get pleasure no matter what I do and constantly feel stress I cannot pinpoint.

Concerta is not supposed to do this but it's not the first time I feel like this when I get off it. I am not diagnosed with any disorder like bipolar or borderline but the possibility has been considered by my therapists in the past. 

People of reddit, what should I do to stop feeling like this?"
1174,Is this normal ?,"Hey! Do you talk to yourself? I know that mind never stops but i think that means thoughts for most of people. But for me is actually talking to me in my head.  Like every minute, every second. And it worries me that is not normal and because my mood changes very quikly i started to worry that i have more personalities or schizophrenia or Something.  I mean i say something or write Something and if its funny i laugh in my head and if its stupid i say "" youre so stupid why did you say that or did that?"". While was studying earlier i thought ""I should drink some juice"". After a while i thought "" I forgot about the juice but its ok ill have it later "" and thats how it goes like the hole day.  No matter what i do.  Im scared a little because i have depression  and anxiety and possibly harm ocd but the last one is not officially diagnosed.  And of i dont talk to myself in my head i have a lot of racing thoughts.  I mean if i see a photo i remember when,  where it was taken and how i felt and when i saw it last time and the people in it like where are they now,  how i feel about them and so many more in just a few seconds.  Can someone relate to this ? Im really scared right now."

My boyfriend died in Oct (I was admitted somewhere then) my mom died in March, my best friend besides the boyfriend who died is moving to New York. I feel so hopeless. Alone in this world. I need help.

Here are the issues:

I am on methadone. I HAVE to find a hospital that will give methadone (I know some do Ive been to a few)

I don't have a car so I will have to take a bus to the hospital. We have 3 one doesn'y have a unit but they will  send to other hospitals. The 2nd one mental health unit is AWFUL its whe re the sickest of sick go so you don't get alot of help. The 3rd one the one I usually go to had changed alot we used o have groups where the depressed/suicial/lucid were in one group and those who were still to sick to participate right had another group well that stopped so therapy and activites is half explaining over and over game rules or non sense talk because they are so sick.

I don't know what I should do. Should I go to the hospital with no unit and hope they send me somewhere good. Call metal hospitals and do a screening and see about transpotation?

1178,I’m ok but it feels like I’m not even though I am but... yeah,"I’m absolutely fine but I get thoughts about that not being the case. Physically, I’m fine. Why should I question that? But like... am I SURE??? Ugh actually saying this makes me feel bad bc the feelings feel more real... but anyway, this feeling is sort of affecting me in how I eat. I mean, how do I know if putting two slices of cheese in my cheese sandwich instead of one isn’t going to be bad for me? I also just... feel my body over just to check in fine...

Just... how can I stop this before it turns into a bigger problem for me? It’s fairly minor at the moment

Ya girl a mess.  

I am stressed, to say the least. Why can’t I get these thoughts to stop? Why is it that every time something somewhat awful happens it effects me like the entire world is ending. I mean that, just last week I got into a fight with a friend, she was a bad friend to me so I called her out, end of the story she didn’t like that and yeah we are no longer friends and I am sitting around obsessing over what she's saying about me or what she's doing or if she's turning my friends against me. 

As outrageous as that all seemed it was very real to me. So real that I had to completely distance myself from my phone, and everything and everyone associated with her just to feel okay. That’s not normal right?  

I assumed that everyone she spoke to now hates me, that her family now hates me, that I am perceived as trash. If I had my phone on my, I was deleting then redownloading my social media apps over and over, making sure I didn’t miss a message incase someone reached out about her. (why would they ever???)  

Then it got so bad I went out of my way to message people and apologize for fighting with my ex friend? I am so scared of people hating me for some reason. 

On top of that my ex friend knows exactly what hurts me the most and what causes me the most distress so I am scared she will use that agsint me.  

All in all I need help learning how to cope with this shit because man oh man I am having a hard time."
1180,Same Day Psychiatric Services?,"So I’m having a string of really shitty mental health days in a row. I’m not suicidal or having any thoughts of hurting myself or others or doing anything destructive, but I REALLY need someone to talk to today. I’ve had anxiety for years, and decided to finally do something about it. My new medical benefits just went into effect recently, so yesterday I called about 15 local practices looking for an appointment. Nobody had any openings before next week. Right now, I have something set up for the end of next week, but that seems like an eternity from now.

Does anyone know of any way I can talk to someone today or even tomorrow? I’m in Central NJ if that makes a difference, although I prefer tele conferencing due to COVID.

Any help is much appreciated!"
1181,Why do I have these delusions and strange thoughts?,"Hey! I'm not sure if this subreddit is the best place to ask this question, so please tell me if there is a better sub for this where I can get some answers.

First of all, I know I shouldn't ask strangers on reddit what the hell is wrong with me, I have my first therapy session on June 11th ever since corona started, so I'm sure I can talk about my experience there, but I hoped by asking people who might be familiar with this, could tell me their experience and maybe give me a bit more clarity about what's going on.

I have had these 'symptoms' for as long as I can remember, but slowly over time, I have started to realise these thoughts and behaviours aren't exactly normal. I'm currently 16, btw, if that helps. Also, I have been diagnosed with depression, general anxiety and social anxiety and I'm probably gonna be diagnosed with ptsd, but I haven't done any tests or whatever for that.

It's gonna sound pretty stupid but these are what I'm struggling with:
- everytime I watch a show or movie or read a book, I get instantly attached to the characters and that universe that I can't stop thinking about it. It's as if I live in that world and I have to remind myself that this is the real world. I can't tell the fantasy world apart from the real world.
- speaking of the fantasy thing, I have to fantasize about something like a story before going to sleep or else I'll stay awake the whole night. But sometimes (this actually happened last night) sometimes I get too into the fantasy and cannot stop thinking about it, so much so that I also can't sleep either.
- I feel as if people can read my mind and that I'm constantly being manipulated. I feel as if everyone's action has a deeper meaning to it. I believe that I'm being controlled by someone or something and everything, even objects, are watching me. I believe that everything is made up by my head and nothing is real. Other people don't exist, I just made them up.
- I always talk to myself in my head, but I've started to realise how I suddenly start a conversation in my head. Like, I just randomly think of a sentence and start a conversation. It feels as if that conversation is put in my head without me wanting to. I can zone out and talk non stop in my head before I realise what I'm doing.

I don't know what this means and these are pretty specific so google hasn't been helpful. I'm very ashamed of these things, because I feel stupid for feeling as if I'm being controlled. I have never talked to my therapist about these things and I think it's gonna sound so weird when I suddenly mention these thoughts. Hope to get some clarity about this."
1182,Addressing Concerns,"So long and short of it is my wife has Bipolar 2 depression which causes her to have hypomanic episodes (inflated self worth, thrill seeking, risky behaviour etc) from time to time. 

She has been medicated for it for a while and seems to be doing pretty well, but occasionally she shows signs of slipping into a manic state and when she does, she does things that concern me. 

She gets hyper sexual, which I dont mind, what red blooded man would. She sends me photos that I enjoy, of a very explicit nature. She also spends a lot of time on social media platforms like snapchat and Instagram talking to people.

Normally I wouldn't think much of it, after all, we live in a largely social media driven world, but then she sends me photos that have snapchat filters, and are obvious screenshots taken from snapchat. She sends them to my messaging app, not through snapchat. She jokes about having an exhibitionist streak a mile wide. Correct me if om wrong, but 2+2 sounds an awful lot like she is sharing nudes and other highly sexual photos with other people. Am I reading this wrong? I've been up since 3am keeping myself from grabbing her phone and looking for proof, but I'm driving myself up a wall with all the narratives my brain is cranking out.

Any perspective? Advice?"
1183,Advice for intrusive thoughts and verbal tics?,"Hi everyone,

I'm fjuckthisshit, cleverly named after my verbal tics.

I'm not here to vent, but for actual advice, so if you have any to spare, or links to online resources, I'm all ears. 

I don't have tourettes, but I struggle with insecurity and self-loathing. Some days, like today, stuff bubbles to the surface, and I constantly have to catch myself from yelling out loud ""Fuck I hate myself!"". I mean, it can get pretty weird if I suddenly blurt that out around my colleagues. My tics are always triggered by a flashback an embarrassing memory, or something that I just realized I should probably feel embarrassed about. 

Sometimes my these tics are accompanied with hand gestures, like blowing my brains out with finger pistols, or cutting my wrists. I sometimes feel like cutting or choking myself would be a relief, but I know it won't. I don't physically self-harm. 

I've never met anyone else that have the same tics  related issues. However, I find it very unlikely that out of 7 billion people on this planet, I'm the only who struggle with this.

Please, does anyone have any helpful tips?

And just in case you are concerned. Other people are never the focus of these intrusive thoughts.

1184,Has anyone experienced blacking out like this? Trigger warning: self harm.,"Trigger warning for self harm!!

The last couple of days i havent had my birth control. It kind of keeps my hormones in check and i can feel a huge difference in how i react to scenarios when im on and off of it.

I have been in a lot of distress lately and i am an avid self harmer. Its not every day anymore like it used to be, but it happens often when i feel im coming to my breaking point. Like when life feels like its fallin down around me and i cant repair anything, i turn to self harm. Usually its in some sort of panic attack, and something i feel hard to describe happens.

Most of the time i dont remember what happens when i self harm. I always do the same thing:

1. i begin to have a panic attack about whatever is going on
2. i start to frantically search for something to use (breaking open razors are my favorite but i also use box cutters and scissors)
3. i look in the mirror and i black out.

after this i end up somehow end up back and im okay again. just shaken up by the whole situation. the last time this happened i remember staring into my eyes in the mirror and telling myself “what are you waiting for you stupid bitch” and thats the last thing i recall. bits and pieces of the blood dripping come back to me but most of its a blur. like my body feels its in autopilot and im no longer in control.

its been getting worse and worse. i have had recurrent dreams of me going to a particular spot and killing myself. my last failed attempt to cut myself (this is after i threw away EVERYTHING i used or was tempting, besides my moms razor in her shower because i thought shed be mad. i ended up trying to break it open and i couldnt) i remember nothing after telling myself to “grab your fucking keys and start driving”. I ended up at the spot, a quarry with very tall cliffs. Not truly remembering how i got there. 

Does anyone else go through this in complete distress and panic? I often find myself talking to myself in the mirror just to talk to her and throw insults, but once i begin to self harm its like ive lost all control."

I cannot figure out how to not only be my mind and this awful feeling. Mother has always been emotionally gone, completely unconscious only worried about her story and how she looks to everyone else, also doesn't seem like she understands her emotions either.

I can't imagine him roaming the streets on one of these protests. I usually have something I'm obsessing about at any given time, but usually it's something I'm enjoying (like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley). I can't stop thinking about these protests, the rubber bullets, the shots fired, police brutality, all that. I live very close to downtown. It's not a huge downtown or anything, but we have had some protests here. I haven't heard of anything crazy happening though. Last night my husband and I heard what we both thought were gunshots. He usually assures me that sounds aren't gunshots, but this time he even looked out the window which really freaked me out.

I don't really know if they were gunshots, but it certainly didn't help. I'm shaking, I'm not eating. I threw up a couple days ago and I can't do any of my work (I'm working from home). My auditory hallucinations are slowly creeping back. I can't clean or do anything. I feel paralyzed by this, and I can't see my therapist until next week.

1195,Am I sick or just lazy?,"Hi. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a native speaker of the English language, and I do not live in the USA. I am sorry, nevertheless, I hope some of you might read my chaotic introduction.

I am writing this post because I feel a bit lost in my life, even considering all the options to be honest, like never before.

I am a 21 years old male. Everyone calls me lazy. My teachers used to call me lazy, my mother thinks I am extremely lazy. I generally do not clean my room, because the mess does not disturb me. My mother eventually cleans it up. 

I had a period where I dropped out of school and practically did not leave the house for half a year. Nowadays I am, like many young people, supposed to study online(I came back to school and now am enrolled in an academy of sorts).  But I have done at best 5% of studying that was expected of me. I almost never study at home, from a book, which is considered lazy I think. I don't do groceries, I don't do house chores. I feel bad for my mother who I am a burden to. I must admit I am having troubles with myself, especially recently. My mother apparently lost all her faith in me and tells me to get even the worst job so we can split the bills, or else I should pack myself up. Around a year ago a doctor diagnosed me with schizophrenia. Around a week ago I decided that I am not sick, and stopped taking the meds. But boy, if I really am healthy, some strange coincidences have been happening. I have had a few rows with my mother. My disregard for academic commitments has caused me to potentially face many correctional examinations due September. The thing is, I am not stupid. I do stupid things, but I am not stupid. I did relatively well at school considering I did not study. I had been doing well in the academy, up until the quarantine hit. 

You must also know a few things about me. First, I weight 240 pounds at 5'10. I had been very fit all my life, doing all kinds of sports until I started taking meds. 

Secondly, the thing I have been doing for the last few of years in my free time(which I have had a lot of) is computer gaming. I even dream about making a living out of playing, although after some years I am still not good enough. It is safe to say that I am addicted to it, and every single time I tried to ditch games, I failed. The last time was a couple of days ago. 

I am just wondering if the fact that I am clearly not a functional human is out of my control, or is it because I am just lazy. I want to achieve something in life, I have always been ambitious. But right now I am feeling really down. I enjoy participating in the classes a lot, but when it comes to any homework, or  mundane tasks, such as groceries, chores, money transfers, turning in some papers to the academy. I just do not seem to care. For example, i still have not paid for nor received the student's ID, even though almost a year has passed, simply because it would require me to go the bank. I don't even know if I can pass the year without paying for it. And if I don't pass the year, I will have to find a job, which for a lazy person like me who has never seriously worked would be the last thing I'd like to do. In fact I used to have a job after I dropped out of school, at McDonald's. I was doing 6 hour shifts, doing fine making fries. Then they wanted me to learn how to prepare the chicken, I got overwhelmed and did not show up the next day. I guess a week of working is too much for a lazy piece of shit like me.

I also have very poor hygiene whenever I am not leaving the house, which is all the time nowadays.

I think that is all you need to know. I hope you have read it, even though I am not a good writer. What do you think about me? Is there hope for me to achieve something in life? What should I do?"
1196,STOP SEEKING A DIAGNOSIS FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING YOU MAY THINK IS OUT OF THE ORDINARY.,"Stop seeking diagnosis in general for that matter. Sure, I understand that labels help some people come to terms with their illness and if that's the case, go ahead and ignore what I'm about to say. Having a diagnosis is not always helpful. It is just as easy for a mental health professional to treat you based on your symptoms. Symptomatic relief is the way forward. You do not need a label for this. 

I'm saying this for a couple of reasons. One being; Once you have a diagnosis, it's there for life, it will follow you around, service to service, professional to professional, most people will not question it. They will attribute all of your behaviours to a condition or disorder, it takes away from your personality, from your natural quirks. It prevents people from getting to know the 'real' you and it often means the root cause of your symptoms is overlooked. You will no longer be a person but a tick box. 

Another reason is the huge stigma that is attached to so many mental health disorders. You may think you want to be diagnosed because you feel it will validate your condition. Sure, it may make you feel validated for a time, like you really are ill and you can accept that, but trust me, in the months and years to follow, you will notice that you are treated differently to everyone else. The doctors you visit will speak to you in a different way, they may be patronising, they may label you attention seeking, they may even put you down as a lost cause. And THAT is extremely invalidating. 

So please, please stop. By all means look for help, you deserve to feel better whatever your problem may be, but don't believe that a label is always going to help, because in the end, it can become a massive hindrance."
1197,Am i crazy?,"I personify my thoughts. Ive talked in my head to myself since i can remember. I dont believe im developing any psychosi, ive always done this, theyre not audible, theyre not telling me to harm anyone, theyre just how i sort out my day to day life. They usually feel as though they originated in my head, and not some outside force. The problem i face today, is, they dont feel like theyre mine anymore. Theyre still thoughts, silent, not hallucinations, ""voices"" or malevolent. But they feel like theyve become personified like that scene in at worlds end. Like a conscience, but instead of me thinking, i should get back to work, they now say, isaac, get back to work. Or isaac, you want to play video games. Should i seek help?"
1198,Trying to help my mom,"I have tried to convince my mom for years to see a therapist but she refuses. 

Some background: My dad died when I was young, about 17 years ago so I was solely raised by mom for all of my life. My mom was alone for about 7 years until she finally started dating again. 

First boyfriend: Once she met this main her personality drastically changed. She began only liking things he liked and even started speaking like him. It was almost like she was a chameleon. She would send me and my siblings to my grandparents every weekend and would never spend time with us. If I complained about this she would go into hysterics and say that I just want her to be alone. This would happen all the time. She would make me feel guilty for wanting to spend time with her. The person she dated was emotionally abusive toward me and my siblings but my mom never noticed, or she pretended to notice. One day he physically tried to hurt my brother and I completely lost my cool and forced him to leave. After that day she broke up with him and suddenly she would trash him all the time for not treating us right. 

Second boyfriend: Again with the personality change. She would only do things that he liked. She would pretend that she liked things for years even though my siblings and I knew it was a sudden interest. For example she claimed to love hockey, because he liked hockey, even though she had never liked hockey before. He eventually broke it off and she went into hysterics and blamed us for not making an effort to get to know him. 

Third boyfriend: The third man she dated was shortly after the second but they have been in a relationship for 7 years. I actually do like him because he is pretty laid back and easy to get along with. I prefer hanging out alone with him and my siblings than when my mom is there. If my mom is there she likes to put on a whole show. It’s like she suddenly acts like my family is so close even though that is not the case. At home we are not a very emotional family. There is no hugging, but suddenly around him she’s a hugger. 

Lately my mom has been beginning to almost steal my personality. Bands I listen to, she is beginning to listen to. The thing is she claims to have listened to them for years. I buy a new top, she will go out and buy an identical one. It’s just weird things I notice, and don’t think to much of. 

She also has been a pretty compulsive liar my entire life. Anytime she comes home she has a new story to tell, but most of the time they feel so made up. It’s happening more lately and is very concerning.

I have also caught her pretending to talk to people on the phone. When the conversation doesn’t feel normal I check her call log and figure out that there was no one on the other line. 

All of these things have been really concerning over the years and I have begged and pleaded for my mom to see a therapist. It’s hard to have an emotional bond with her because she causes me such bad anxiety anytime I’m around her. 

I’m at my wits end and have been distancing myself from her lately because I can’t be around her without her triggering and anxiety or panic attack. 

How can I convince her to seek mental health assistance?"
1199,Constant anxiety and stomach ache,"Hello, this is my first post here

I'm now 17 years old, and when I was 13 so approximately four years ago I started having daily stomach ache. Just a quick background info, i have always been shy and kinda coward, and wanting to behave well, both in social situations and gradewise in school. I didn't eat lost a lot of weight and stayed home a lot from school. Then we ran a lot of tests and whatever to find out that it was nothing physically wrong. Then I started therapy when I was 14/15 and I'm still regularly see him. There was a clear connection between anxiety and a nervous situation resulting in stomach ache. I have had my ups and downs, but generally I have had stomach ache from time to time everyday, but nothing that bothered me so much, around the time of 14-16. I started go to school more and met friends and felt mostly fine when I came home from school.

But this last year in highschool I have had not severe but a lot stronger stomach pain, almost everyday. And it's kind of the only thing I can think of, trying to feel if I'm having any stomach pain. This year I stayed at home a lot in the beginning but then was just about to come back to school, when the pandemic began and we started having distanced school. Going to school and socializing was for me an essential part to have the courage to meet people outside of school.
But now I'm always home doing absolutely nothing, don't tolk to people at all and don't meet anyone even though I sometimes get invited to things. And I have a lot of stomach ache every day, and it's the only thing I can think about. Even though there is no proof of it being a disease and it is mental, I don't meet friends only in fear of having stomach ache when I meet them.

My writing might've been a little messy, but I hope someone understands my situation. I feel like therapy doesn't really help me, and I wonder if anyone has been in a similar situation and maybe have some advice.

Thanks!"

1209,How can I keep a positive attitude while surrounded by negative people?,"I have a long history with major depression and after years of work I’ve managed it well. My confidence is pretty great and I’m in a new relationship which is the best of my life. Someone I respected was jealous of me, instead of being happy for me she said I would mess up my relationship; I immediately replied “no I won’t, why would you say that?” She laughed nervously and I knocked on wood. I’m secure and happy but upset by her actions. It hasn’t led to any doubts that I can make it work but I don’t want to be annoyed by it. How do I stop?"
1210,"I had a scary ""mental snap"" two nights ago after smoking weed and am chasing an explanation.","Apologies for long post, but I have to unpack. 

So I've smoked on an off for a decade, I have a fairly checkered past with mental health, but it's a fun combo of depression, anxiety, ptsd, and adhd. Mainly adhd though, the rest is fairly situational and comes in waves. Anyway this past month or so I've been making massive strides through meditation and exercise, and from laying off the weed; meditation has been the big one though. After 4 days of not smoking I smoked a few bongs with my housemate and became paranoid and retreated to my room, not totally unusual but normally I'll just play guitar and vibe out pretty quick, not this time. 

I couldn't stop pacing and thinking so I tried exercise, and then I tried to meditate, but that seemed to open the door completely, and my thoughts became completely overbearing. I became obsessive over the idea of ""solving the problem of consciousness"" and was simultaneously in total control over my actions and also not at all. I was in control, but it was a different ""me"". My conscience/subconscious addressed itself to me as ""the haver"", and claimed it was here to stay (The way I explained ""the haver"" to my friend the next day was like, when I tell my arm to move, it moves, when I address a question to myself ""the haver"" responds). 

The next three hours was typing and scribbling, all trying to figure out the nature of how thoughts/actions/internal monologue interact. I've studied both philosophy and psychology at university so this is stuff I think about anyway, but this was different, I was obsessed and could not stop. I felt powerful and in total control. As the high wore off, I sort of came back to myself, but 2 days later my brain still feels stretched out, and last night I had nightmares all night about going insane.

I gave my weed to my housemate and will not be smoking again. I'm afraid to meditate as I don't feel like that door is closed yet, as the questions I had in that state are still nagging at me, and a part of me wants to reach back into that feeling of power and control even though I know that it was pure delusion.

Any insight would be really appreciated as it's left me very very shaken. It's 3 in the morning, and I worry I'm in for another night of nightmares..."
1211,Trying to make a difference,"I’m 20 and I have (and still am) battled with depression/anxiety. For the longest time I have wanted to help others and do my part in raising awareness on mental health. I finally decided to take a leap the other day and created an instagram/blog account to help spread the lessons, stories and strategies that have helped me in my past. I just started and don’t really know where this will go, but I do know that I am passionate. I’m asking if you could support me by following my account or give any tips on what more I could do. It would genuinely mean a lot to me. ( @yourhealingheart on Instagram)

1213,Shitty Life,During this lockdown I have been having been having bad time. I am suddenly thinking of all the bad things happened to me. I am thinking about those who I thought were my friends but were just destroying my confidence and my self esteem. I am in a constant state of self pity. What did I do so wrong to deserve this. I am thinking about all those when I was in school just a big crybaby and a loser I was. I am thinking why did I have such a abusive person as my father. All those bullying which I thought wasn't a big problem. Why was I big coward. I want to cry and I am not able to. I don't have any confidence anymore. I can't a task as simple as driving a car. I am not ready for what fucked up thing lies ahead of me.
1214,Emergency mental health support for suicidal person with OCD?,"Hi, a good friend of mine had a nervous breakdown last month. He basically had crippling anxiety to the point of starving himself/being bed ridden for days, combined with irregular manic episodes and intense mood swings..etc.. Fortunately, we convinced him to reach out to a psychiatrist who diagnosed him with OCD which was exacerbated by the COVID 19 outbreak.

He was prescribed Fluvoxamine and has been taking them for about two weeks now. Things were getting better until he suddenly had an allergic reaction to the meds, with rash breaking out all over his back and arms. The GP recommended him to stop taking Fluvoxamine immediately but his psychiatrist isn't available to prescribe new meds until next Monday, so now his anxiety is back with a vengeance. Due to several external factors combined with the withdrawals, he's now going through an intense manic episode which has gotten very dark and I have reasons to believe he's suicidal.

None of us (his family/support system) are able to be there physically for him right now and we're very worried. We have contacted his one friend in the area to reach out/check in on him but I'm wondering if there are any additional emergancy support/mental health services we could reach out to get him at least through this weekend? He normally lives in NYC but is currently staying in Connecticut.

Thank you very much."

I'm doing a big research project surrounding PTSD, trauma, and how it can affect one's relationships and the way we feel about society and how we fit in. If you have any experience in this area, or any stories to share, please please do.

I’ve tried eating healthy, vitamins/ supplements, cold showers, meditation positive affirmations. I refuse to ever call out of work because of a mental health. I have panic attacks at work and feel insanely guilty for it. I’m scared if I reach out to any of my friends or family they will look at me as weak and lazy. I go to therapy weekly it’s been about 10 months now. I tried to call my therapist today but she’s off. It just feels like this will never end."
1221,Overthinking little things need advice,"Hi Everyone! I hope you are all doing well during this pandemic and current circumstances. I can use some advice. I am an over thinker and have general anxiety disorder. I used to not over think when talking to new people, although I would be nervous/anxious sometimes I was more confident. Now, I am 20 almost 21 and over think every day. I over think talking to girls. My friend gives me advice on it saying how its normal to be nervous in the beginning and that just made me anxious. Now I feel like I have to be nervous in the beginning when talking to a girl because she said it's normal. Also, I am able to act fine when talking to a girl when nervous but when im anxious I can't because I have racing thoughts then. Even making a phone call to a pizza place I was like ""should I be nervous right now?"" I ordered fine and seemed confident but I was over thinking it the whole time. I used to not over think little things like this. I am close to asking for medication because I have tried therapy. On the good note, I am more confident now in myself but over thinking and anxiety holds me back from feeling good and putting myself out there. Thank you."
1222,I'm sad when people I know go out and have fun,"Uh, so like the topic says, I'm very sad when people I know and are close to me go out and have fun. I'm only 20, but I can count on my one hand times I went out with a group of people. It makes my chest heavy when they tell me that they're going out or are out already, cause I never experienced it in a way most of people in my age did. When I get a chance to go out with more than 1 person I'm very awkward, quiet and people just don't talk to me after one group meeting. I'm very stressed when I have to talk in a group of people, even say a joke or just join a conversation, so I'd rather not talk cause my stress takes up and I mess everything, I don't say exactly what I wanted to say and I'm stuttering. For now I mostly have internet friends that I play games with, recently I've been going out with one girl I meet couple weeks ago, we haven't go out yet with her friends but I think It'll be another relation that'll go down because of how I act - or more like how I don't act at all. I don't think I'm looking for any advice here, just wanted to share this as I'm sitting with a cigarette right now and try to not to cry. 

Stay safe everyone, have a good day."

1224,I feel as if I've lost all sense of effort and determination.,"I used to be a pretty hard worker while I was in school. I would have the energy to keep myself working no matter how tough or boring something was. I managed to keep this up all the way until senior year, where, eventually, it felt like something that was there, just suddenly wasn't. It was as if something snapped and changed me as a person completely. 

Where before, I was outgoing and willing to try new things, now i'm cowering in my room, just a few clicks away from applying for college but never bringing myself to finish. About to begin trying to livestream but making new excuses every minute. Trying to learn how to draw and paint better, but always allowing myself to get distracted. Looking at job listings that I KNOW I'm qualified for but never applying.

I can say with certainty that this isn't because of COVID-19; I've been like this for two years now.

I can't bring myself to try anymore. If anyone maybe has some advice, or maybe some resources, it would 100% be appreciated. If you know a good therapist in South-Central PA, USA, I would also appreciate info on them."
1225,My family doesn’t believe me,"I just really needed somewhere to vent to because i’m so tired of bottling everything in, my family doesn’t believe me and I don’t want to talk to my friends about this anymore because i feel as if i’m bothering them.

Before I start, i’d just like to say that i’m 16 years old, and I don’t really know what I feel, since i’ve always been told that it’s nothing, but this doesn’t feel like nothing. 

My parents, they’re immigrants from Mexico, so for them, it was always in a sense, survival of the fittest. My dad grew up in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights, a community made up of many other latinx members and chicanos, so since he was 18, he began working, trying to make something for himself. 

Meanwhile, my mom was in Mexico, she never made it past elementary school education because she had to provide for her family, and that’s all she ever really knew, provide. 

When my parents met, they got married and moved to the United States, it was a struggle at first, they had 4 kids, and lived in a one bedroom house in California, all they would do is work. Eventually, we all moved to Texas, and we are now living a middle class life and our family is no longer struggling. 

Because of the way they were brought up, and their situations, mental health was never brought up, I think the Latino/Hispanic community has a really bad stigma when it comes to mental health, they think of it as a weakness and something that can be looked past, or something that can go away, due to the fact that all they really knew growing up was to “survive”

Because of this, I never really got to express the way i felt, don’t get me wrong, my childhood was amazing, and so was my pre-teen years.

I started feeling this way my sophomore year of highschool, my freshman year, I was in a really bad place when it came to my friend group and relationships, He would hit and push me sometimes, and he even broke my phone, putting things in my head. That made me change how i felt towards myself, I would wear baggy clothes and hate to look in the mirror. 

Sophomore year, I got out of that situation, i started dressing nice and I made a better friend group, but i still felt this way, i felt hopeless and sad all the time, i was just tired of everything, but i would cover it up by dressing nice and being social, for a while, it worked. 

I am now going to be a junior, and i’m just so tired of everything. I feel so apathetic i suppose, and it’s like my old careless self is gone, I don’t eat, i stay up all night, and i just don’t care for anything, i lost all motivation. I just don’t want to be here anymore. 

My family, they don’t understand, they think I am just being irresponsible and lazy, and I mean, maybe I am, i mean, my parents had a rough life, and my older siblings grew up in a lower class home, meanwhile i’m living my teenage years in a nice middle class home, so why should i be complaining? 

I don’t know how to bring this us to them, whenever i do, they brush it off by saying i just need to clean or eat right. 

I’m so tired of acting like everything is okay, I just want to give up, i don’t know how to bring up this situation anymore, and maybe this isn’t mental illness, i’m not sure, i’m just so tired of keeping things bottled in."
1226,am i really my own worst enemy? trigger warning,"i have lost it today and i know i am my own worst enemy and i know it doesn't make me a better person knowing this things i have done and how vile i am and was and i can take blame my mental health is a part of it but the other part is my family i know saying sorry doesn't help and i say the most horrible words and i am not using this as an excuse but it just comes out my mouth i do not know if i can stop it sometimes.

1230,"Friend denying MH issues, posing a potential danger to others - what should I do?","Hi, I hope me posting this here isn't inappropriate, but I'm kind of at my wits' end about this.

I have a friend who is in serious denial about her mental state. It's none of my business, maybe, but she could pose a threat to others around her. She's an alcoholic, and has been abusing cannabis and possibly other substances, and is engaged in a lot of scaremongering through her social media presence, and saying a lot of perjurious things about a lot of people, especially if she has any hint that they might disagree with the things she says. She's lashing out and being hurtful now, and if it gets any worse she could make real trouble for people.

Six, seven months ago, she was someone I could be really proud of. She'd quit the drink and been dry for eighteen months or so, had a really great partner who was good for her and encouraged her in all the right ways, and was making good progress with her career (as a secondary school teacher). That ended almost literally overnight.

We never had particularly regular contact, but we were fairly close at one point, and I know that she's capable of a lot. I've been here on the sidelines since new year, and seen her make seriously bad judgments of things like COVID-19 situation and other political events since she started drinking again. Her depression is back, her moods are unstable, and she is simply not a nice person at the moment - and not someone I'd be happy allowing to teach my children.

Again, I've been mostly on the sidelines, engaging only very infrequently.

I'm asking about this here, by the way, because I know she needs help. I know I'm not the person that can give it, but some things have become obvious today that I could do something about - I just don't know if I should.

Basically, most of her friends on Facebook have taken note of how her behaviour has been degrading in recent months, and she's been denying these things most vehemently, saying her mental health is fine and perfect, and attempting to prove otherwise.

Now, earlier on this afternoon, she tagged me in a live broadcast she'd put out on Facebook. I had been going to ignore it, but the frame the picture was frozen at showed a letter, which I was curious to read. So I did - I transcribed it from the image and read it. Essentially, it said that she had been discharged because she hadn't been cooperating or attending meetings or telephone conferences. So then I listened to her reading it - but what she was saying wasn't what the letter said: she was redacting the letter as she read, to make it seem as though she had been discharged because her mental state is fine.

Evidently her mental state is so off-kilter that she can present an obvious lie as though it was the truth and expect to be believed, and yet because she presents as being functional, the authorities can't intervene without her consent and cooperation.

So here's my question - two questions:

* If I contacted her social worker, whose name and phone number were on the letter, and offered the recording of her telling everyone the exact opposite of what the letter says, would it hold any water as proof that she really *needs* help?
* If yes, should I? Or should I edge away quietly and let whatever happens unfold without my intervention?"

1233,How to not lose your mind with every single uni assignment?,"Hello everyone. First of all, I realise there are much worse things going on than this but I've been struggling with mental health for a few months and would welcome any help.

I am quite an overachiever, always anxious and stressed out about everything I do and say. It is becoming worse and worse, especially when it comes to my uni assignments. It's my first year of uni and I am studying abroad, and due to current situation been living alone for 5 months.

I always get way too in my head when it comes to assignments. During the entire process I become an anxious mess, having multiple mental breakdowns, not getting any rest. I always overthink every single word and information I write down and think of everything I do as not good enough. 

I try to divide my work into smaller parts to make it seem more manageable, however, I lose my mind with every single assignment. I usually get pretty good grades but I drag the process every single time (even if it's a topic I am interested in) knowing it will have such negative effects on my mental health.

Does anyone have any tips on how to make stay calmer during the process or any techniques? Thank you very much!"

The issue is, I used to be 130 lb at 6 feet tall. Now I’m over 160, and yet I still see myself as just as skinny. I’m not trying to debate what’s the right body type. That’s not what this sub is for. I just want to know if anyone has strategies to be more accepting of their own body. It’s not even just my own body. I feel like if I look at another man with a normal sized body I still see him as too skinny. I honestly want to stop overthinking this and to barely even notice physical flaws (I hate using that word) on people. I don’t even want to look at someone’s body as flawed. I genuinely want to see beauty in many different body types."
1235,I'm having multiple mental issues and I wanted to share that with you,"Hey, I'm a 17 years old male, or rather, a boy. I have few personal problems that bother me. I suffer quietly so I figured that I would at least share my experience with you, Reddit.

First of all, I am anorectic, it is not visible though, I maintain my weight at a healthy level, but as soon as I get over some threshold I adjust my calorie intake accordingly. This mostly happens after I overeat because of the diet before. And so the cycle repeats. This mainly fuels my other problems, because when some friends invite me to hang out, I mostly reject, not because I don't want to go, but because I was in the “overeat part of the cycle” and my weight went up and I think I'm really fat and I don't want my friends to see that.

I'm quite friendly guy, I am not shy. I talk to most of my classmates and even to few people from different classes or schools. It might seem that I know a lot of people, but from my perspective I feel quite lonely. I think that all those friendships are shallow and I don't like that. I don't have a best friend. I feel that mostly I have to make an effort to move the conversations. Is it me? Am I a bad friend?Whats wrong with me?

I am a science and computers guy as well. I have set for myself a goal I want to achieve. After high school I want to go to a certain uni, but I have to pass some exams in order to get enrolled. I feel that I am not that smart. The exams test specific areas of intelligence and I know that I am not good at the spacial intelligence part. I am scared that I wont pass the exams and I will have to live knowing that I am a failure and cant get to a uni. That's the exact reason why I don't want to take an IQ test. What will I do when I find out that I'm dumb?

This is where suicidal thoughts come in. If I am dumb or cant get to a uni, where will be my place in the world. I really want a higher education and I cant imagine myself in a world without one. You see, I don't believe in a god or afterlife. If I don't have a place in the world, I can just kill myself in a snap of fingers. Everyone will die someday. Why bother living a life as a failure if I can “fast forward” to the end of the time and get rid of my feelings as a failure? Why?

PS: Of course this is a throw-away account. I don't even have the courage of a man to post it on my main account. I am a coward and a selfish prick.

TL;DR: I am a lonely, anorectic and possibly dumb mess with suicidal thoughts."
1236,Dramatically emotional to feeling nothing,"Sometimes I’ll spend weeks being so emotional over past and present things, I’ll cry so much, I’ll take every word and tone defensively and I’ll make quick decisions on irrational thoughts. And then I’ll spend other weeks completely numb, barely feeling like I’m actually here, I have to make myself laugh when other people talk because I can’t do it myself, I can’t really react to anything but inside I want to scream that I’m hurting. I don’t know which I’d rather feel."
1237,How do you tell your parents you want to go to therapy?,"Hello. 

For the past few months i’ve been feeling really really dysmorphic, and now,I just feel so apathetic. I lost all motivation for everything I suppose, I dont find interest in any of my hobbies anymore, I don’t eat, I just stay up all night (I don’t mean to) and sleep for a few hours, and then repeat. It’s sort of like this dark tunnel in my stomach and it just mutes out everything, so I guess that’s how i feel, really monotoned. 

in the past, I was in a really really bad situation (atleast for a 16 year old girl) and it really caused me to have sort of a trauma i guess, I mean i have commitment and intimacy issues now, but i feel like this is more than that. 

Anyways, my friends told me I should seek therapy, but my parents don’t really believe in mental health, and i don’t really know how to bring this up, I was wondering if you guys can help? thank you."
1238,Are my reasons good enough to go to a psychiatrist at kaiser.,"I’m going through a lot in my life at the moment. A breakup from a 6 year relationship, still dealing with childhood trauma, body image issues and self esteem. 

When I called kaiser to make an appointment to seek therapy and they asked why I wanted to go. I didn’t feel like my answers were good enough because I don’t have a serious mental illness, I don’t have an addiction to drugs or alcohol, and I don’t self harm. 

I just told her I’m going through a lot in life and previously therapy had helped me.

Just seeking some clarity or confirmation that I should go."
1239,what is going on with me?,"reddit; i come here because i've severely fucked up.

my name is kei, and i've been on and off of discord for a long time.

and i have a problem; and i'm not sure what's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

once my mental capacity fucking crashes all i can think about doing, instead of taking a break from places and trying to do something that would help me, i. make multiple accounts, and start making fake realitys in servers. and while i'm doing it, all i can think of is myself and not what i could be doing to other people. people have called me a manipulator, a dirtbag, a ""pity party creator"", and i probably gave some people trust issues while doing it. 

i can't trust my own mind when it comes to making an online account, because for some reason every time i do i end up making more and making fake realities.

i finally realized that this was completely fucked up after a group of people added me to a dm and just started going off at me; asking me if i felt any remorce at all. which, i do. but while i was doing it i didn't which is what really concerns me.

is this some sort of - coping mechanism? or is it a sign of something else? i need some kind of help, i don't want to do this again.

1243,EMDR first session questions,"I had my first EMDR session yesterday and I left feeling good, but I went home and just crashed. A lot of anxiety, feeling heartbroken about a breakup that happened awhile ago, but I powered through and went to bed.

Today, I woke up feeling off, and now I have this feeling of intense dread/ shakiness/ massive depression w/ a pretty bad migraine that I can’t place. No new memories are re-surfacing and I can’t place what memory/experience is causing this. I just feel helpless. What do I do?"
1244,I need advice - My long-distance friend has severe depression and I'm scared for them,"I have had a best friend online for a couple of years now, and I care for her more than anything. She's a super sweet caring person who's been through a lot of shit in her life. She has severe depression which has gotten much worse this year. Her other friends keep stabbing her in the back, her mother and siblings keep abusing her. She only has me and a couple of other people, everyone else seems to keep hurting or leaving her. Since we mainly text, I thought that we were making progress, but she recently told me how shitty her situation actually is, to a point where I think I barely talked her out of committing suicide last night. Today another group of friends completely ditched her and I'm really scared for her. I've been bawling my eyes out and I'm very stressed since there's no way I can help her.  

She's getting help and is on medication but nothing seems to be working. I'm just very scared, She really means the world to me and it frustrates me that I'm unable to help her. What can I do?"
1245,I walked out on my brand new job today...,"I’m so used to working in an office environment doing customer service, medical, or computer/filing related work. Due to this pandemic I lost the opportunity to work in those kinds of settings and got way too anxious and depressed being home all day, so I took up a job in fast food out of desperation. I’m not used to standing for long periods of time so my feet were on fire after a few hours, they made me clean the lobby and bathrooms twice. One of those times I had to get down on all fours and wipe piss off the men’s bathroom floor. I almost puked. They didn’t let me borrow the mop for it because they said they only use the mop for the kitchen. Mind you, it was my first day there and they left me alone after only an hour of training, I messed up on some orders and got bitched at by customers. I have serious issues with my anger and anxiety so you could imagine how I was feeling. I was sweating, they made me take off my jewelry. They all reeked of marijuana (the employees/people training me). I got so fed up told the manager I was going on break and walked to a nearby gas station to sit and cry. I called my mom and she picked me up. The good news is it’s not hard for me to find a job, and I’m able to do food deliveries now for postmates because my card just came in. It was a really overwhelming experience. Thank you for reading and letting me vent. IT GETS BETTER. Peace and love."
1246,Disgusted and feel guilty eating food now. Dunno why,"All of the sudden, the past few months ive felt rather repelled and disgusted by eating. I get flashbacks of memories eating with my family and feeling disgusted and pretty uncomfortable. Seeing my family members shove mountains full of food into their pie hole, including myself, makes me feel like a pig, greedy and simply selfish for consuming food. 

I never really had problems with food until now recently. I just dont know why its such a bother to me now, maybe cuz my mental health has drastically decreased. Is my issue categorized into a disorder? Perhaps ocd?"
1247,I'm lost and hopeless,"I don't  know anymore what to do. I just feel lonely, lost and hopeless. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up. I'm just doomed to be alone. Nobody ever wants to be my friend when they get to know me. I don't exactly blame them but it still hurts. I'm fat, ugly and shy trans guy. So those traits probably repel most people. I wanna out of this house and city I'm  in now but I can't because I can't even live alone like other adult people. I'm  just so useless burden to this society. I haven't done any work in over 5 years, and now I cant because I dont have any degree. But to get one I need to study but I cant even do that with depression and bpd. 
And if I keep gaining weight I lose the only thing that brings joy to my life floorball. I have already hard time with it with bmi over 40. I go to therapy but I have next appointment on the 17th. I just don't know if I can make it there without actual breakdown."

I want to be at peace with myself, but I don’t think I ever will be. I’m sorry I’ve failed everyone around me. I wish I didn’t."

1253,Full Body Cringe,"I have become semi-agoraphobic over the past several years.  Not to the point where I cannot leave the house, but it is difficult for me.  I dread any interaction with people outside my immediate family -- in person, on the phone, on the internet/email.  

When I am around people, sometimes even a cashier at the grocery store, I obsess over all the dumb things I've said and done (for example, why did it take so long for me to get my debit card out of my wallet, or, do they think I'm giving them a weird look, or was I not friendly enough).   I know that for most of those things,  the person I'm interacting with probably never gave a second thought to.  

Then all my embarrassing memories start flooding my consciousness, dating back to elementary school.  I experience a sort of physical, full body cringe feeling, often accompanied by dizziness and nausea.  If I don't actively distract myself I start to have sort of mild , passive suicidal ideation (FYI I am not suicidal at this time).

I really want to stop being like this.  People in my life do not know why I'm shutting them out.  I'm sure they think I'm a huge asshole."

1257,Mom wishes I was never born,"This is my first personal post to a forum like this in a really long time. I've always been made fun of and attacked for not having the textbook, loving relationship with my mom. This has made it really difficult to ask for help from anyone, as I'm used to my feelings being rejected. I'm in college now, but I've had this issue for my entire life. I live with my mom--my dad passed when I was young so its been the two of us for a really long time. She works a high-stress job and has always expected me to take school as seriously as she does her work. This means never hanging out with my friends after school if I don't want her calling and texting me a million times. If it were up to her, I'd be chained to a desk doing work 24/7 with a gag in my mouth. In middle school I was bullied to the point of self harm but she never even made an attempt to address the problem, saying that I was only 'being a baby' because I didn't want to do more work. When I told her what I was doing to myself she fully didn't believe me, calling me a pussy. I was 13. This attitude has persisted. Whenever other people are around us, she pretends as if we have this caring relationship when the reality is we really don't. She's good at acting as if it's true, so when we're at dinner with her friends and she says all these things about how hard I work all it does is make my blood boil. She calls me nicknames that she makes up on the spot and sends me looks as if she actually expects me to do the same. I'm not sure how sick in the head she is: i don't know if she actually believes that I love her or if this is all manipulation of me and her friends. The one person who's believed me is our neighbor,  but even she only believed me when I was old enough for her to and when I had been telling her about the abuse for years on end. Whenever people leave the two of us alone, she goes on tirades about how I've failed her. I admit it's not just her that is nasty towards me, now that I'm older I know what she's doing is wrong and I call hr out on it. Probably not in the best ways, but I promise you I would never reciprocate the same energy she's sent my way. I've shown up to school with bruises more times than I can count and no one has ever thought twice about it or said anything to me. She's threatened me with her boyfriends and co-workers, saying that if I don't comply she's gonna get her boyfriend to beat me. People tell me I'm outgoing and confident,  so I'm sure it's easy for people to laugh about the problems I have with my mom, believing that I'm exaggerating to be funny. A couple years ago I posted on socials that I got kicked out of the house on a school night in the middle of winter, and all the responses were ""haha epic"".  I've convinced myself that the only reaction people will have to me talking about my mom issues is either laughter or disgust because that's been 99% of the responses. Whenever I bring up how she's treated me to her face, she denies everything. She even denies me hurting myself, she denies ever hitting me. This has driven me to the point of insanity. I know that she's never going to change so I need to find better ways of handling her. I've never had a conversation with someone who's had a similar experience but I'm hoping posting this will help me with that. I know there're people like me out there, I wish I had an easier time talking about it so that I could find them. I don't want my horrible relationship and experiences with her to carry over into other aspects of my life as I become an adult and move away. I know that my anger towards her won't just go away if I move away and never respond to her, I have to process and heal. If anyone has advice on how to lessen her affect on me and how to process traumatizing childhood events I would appreciate it. Also, if there are more specific forums surrounding familial abuse I'm really looking to find support for this. Thank you"
1258,“Your Brain in the Time of COVID-19” a podcast on the complex emotions we are experiencing during this pandemic and how we may cope with them,"My friend and I, two neuroscience PhD students, found ourselves overwhelmed with all sorts of unfamiliar emotions during this pandemic, stress, loneliness, anger...and we decided to go on a journey to understand what’s going on in our head. We recorded what we learnt in this podcast. [Your Brain in the Time of COVID-19](https://anchor.fm/neuro-junkies)
In the first episode, we talked about stress, why we are so stressed out by uncertainty, the history and physiology of stress, how stress influence our decision making, and how we coped with it.
In the second episode, we talked about loneliness, how we evolved to be this way, social media and pets.
There is a lot going on right now, and we want to tell people that they’re not alone in this, and maybe hopefully offer some relief by chatting and sharing about what’s going on in our mind in a genuine way.
We’d love to hear what you thought about this podcast, and perhaps what you’d like to learn more about. Thank you! :)"
1259,"Venting, mental health isn't doing great today.","I woke up this morning and felt decent. I had a good sleep and I was hydrated. Then, all of the sudden I have this mental crash. My girlfriend went to work and she notices that I was not feeling good. I have been basically home alone in silence with no motivation to try and help myself. My virtual escapes such as social media and video games aren't keeping me at bay. I can't take that one step to help myself because I simply don't want to. I would rather just sit here and be sad. I fear that it will make my roomates and my girlfriend sad to see me so it makes me even more sad just thinking about it. I feel like I'm in this mental white noise where even my own brain doesn't want to me feel better. This is strange because yesterday I was in a good mood and was very productive.

1268,Feeling like there is no barrier to block my tears ?,"Hello,

I have been depressed for 3 years now, and was finally feeling better, thinking I was seeing life again like something worth fighting for, but now I have this feeling again;

It is like I have too much tears to contain in my heart, in my head and in my eyes, and that it can flow over at any moment. I feel like crying all the time, and I don't really know why.. 
That feeling just comes for a period of time and then goes away.. but It is like I have no control over my sadness.. I cannot really explain it better, but I was wondering if it was something that was linked to depression, or if someone knows what I am experiencing.. I also cannot find satisfaction in all the things I usually love, even my boyfriend sometimes, even when I try my hardest.
(I have been seeing my boyfriend again, that I hadn't seen since the beginning of quarantine, and my parents don't know about him - it has been 2,5 years - for religious reasons - a major factor in my depression. )

I literally spend hours planning, replanning, worrying, and anxious about my debt. I don't want to do anything except work and sleep. Also I'm not sleeping well because of my anxiety.

Background: Have had mild anxiety since i was 12. Startes smoking weed (hash) and drinking at 13. Between 15-16 i smoked alot, a couple of joints a day and alot of alcohol in the weekends. I stopped smoking and drinking about 6 months ago, because i started to get anxiety attacks when i was high and wanted to kill myself when i was drunk.

About 4 months ago the anxiety attacks started to come back. I spoke to my doctor but he just said it was the hash and it would go away soon, but it didn't.

I have been empty on the inside since and is starting to get more deppresed. I get ancxiety attacks every now and then, nothing big. 

Wondering if anyone has any tips? It gets worse every day"
1276,Deleted social media,All my (22m) social media is deleted and I’m out of my relationship all because of my own fault I was texting another girl. I’ve been paying for many bills and I’ve been working almost 80 hour a week I’m tired and stressed and feel unappreciated so I messaged someone else and got caught now I’m single. Me and my girlfriend (21f) live together I feel I have no place in the world and I mess everything up
1277,I don’t know what’s wrong with me.,"I’ll make it clear now that I used to struggle with depression. I’m going to be a sophomore in college. I struggled with depression throughout high school. When I went to college, I feel as though my depression had significantly decreased or even fully went away. I was happy and such at school. But I would still have episodes. Not really sadness, but I’ve always struggled with concentration and focus. I never really seem to be hungry. I feel as though I get angry and agitated fairly easily. I feel bored very often but I also have very little interest in actually going out and doing something. I sleep A LOT, like almost 12 hours a night. The thing that bothers me the most is my anxiety about the future. I honestly cannot see myself in the future. I can’t picture myself doing anything really. I think about suicide sometimes but I trust myself and know that I wouldn’t do that or want to inflict that pain onto my loved ones. That’s my biggest issue, I have absolutely no idea where my life is going and I just don’t know how much longer I can take that. I’m a psychology major at school so I know most of these are symptoms of depression. And I know that you don’t have to be sad in order to be depressed but I used to struggle with it and I like to think that I overcame it. I still feel the things i listed previously though. I’m not usually sad but i feel that i’m a lot more prone to sadness now. I know this is a lot and it might be confusing but is there anyone that can just help me ease and calm the war zone in my head."
1278,Not a bad day,"I am having another sorta decent day. Tomorrow I am getting a 2nd (and possibly a 3rd) parakeet to keep our current parakeet, Lemon, company for when I start going back out there into the world. That is the good news that I had gotten yesterday: the Partial Hospitalization Program may be opening back up next week! I am excited, but if I have to wear a mask the whole time, that is going to suck. I am 100% FOR wearing masks, but I do have asthma and a phobia of suffocating, so I can only wear one for short times before I start panicking. Still, I will be able to get my routine back and that is worth more than a little suffering. :)  


We have been eating total junk food for a while (pizza, snacks, etc.) and cooking only occasionally, so I am excited to start walking from the bus stop downtown to the Center again to get some exercise. Our county is FINALLY in Yellow Phase, so everyone and their mamas were out and about today. It felt...so NORMAL that I wanted to cry. I know there are still restrictions and social distancing rules, etc. but it was just so nice to see PEOPLE (and remember, I HATE being around crowds and people because of a touch of social anxiety). I seriously felt like chatting with total strangers (that is WEIRD x 100 for me) and it was wonderful to have human contact, so to speak, other than my family.  


Ah I am in such a good mood!! We have pizza coming (sigh...yeah, I am a sucker for this local pizza and I just HAVE to have it today) and life is just...good. I played my favorite game (Team Fortress 2) with my friends and the server I hang out on was a lot of fun. I usually play Pyro (duh) and my friend plays Scout and we have a lot of fun doing the different taunts in the game and stuff.  


Oops well, the pizza will be here momentarily, so I have to scoot. What made my day even better is that there are 2 new Markiplier vids out--Minecraft (YEAHHH!!!) and Raft. I am watching them now. Bai! I hope everyone is having an okay day!"
1279,I go from being somewhat happy and positive of the future to horribly depressed by the day,"tw: mention of suicide/self harm 

I’m not bipolar if that’s what you’re thinking, I have a long history of severe mental issues and lately it’s left me extremely fragile. Like I talkedl with my therapist yesterday after a horrible breakdown, felt better for a day then when work wasn’t absolutely perfect my brain goes “just give up already, kill yourself” and I hate it so much. Like I’ve been dealing with it for so long that the littlest mishap flips the switch. And god, that thought is scarily comforting. I honestly think there comes a point where our minds just can’t take anymore of it and become unstable."
1280,my mom died,"She was never in my life and was a total pos, but I’m still so fucking sad. I always deleted her messages and blocked her accounts. She OD’d this morning and I feel like shit for never talking to her. It’s been a really fucking shitty week."
1281,What's wrong with me?,"WARNING: VERY LONG


Im in a really scary place right now and this is essentially a final attempt to figure out what to do before I do something terrible. Im a 21 year old male. I wont go into too much detail about my life, but just know that while it wasn't too bad, it was very far from perfect and Ive been emotionally isolated from most people in my life for what feels like forever. In terms of what Im already diagnosed with, I have OCD, depression, ADHD, and probably severe agoraphobia. My self esteem is also catastrophically low. But right now, I can only wonder if theres something much darker at play right now. Basically, for the past year and a half my life has been dominated by an excruciating obsession. This obsession revolved around being a good person. My therapist calls it ""moral scrupulosity"". Its a type of OCD. It means Im absolutely obsessed with having the right morals/beliefs and I constantly ruminate and self analyze and perform internet research to find out if I am or not. But it was through this obsession that I started to wonder if there was something wrong with me. As I peeled back layers of my psyche and dug deeper into my own head, I felt as though I kept stumbling upon more and more red flags. I kept remembering bad things I'd done in the past, and aspects of my personality and worldview that seemed downright awful. Prior to this obsession, I had always envisioned myself as a good person. Someone who was not only kind, but empathetic. However as my obsession continued, a new image began to form. An image of a selfish, pathetic mess of a human being. A borderline delusional individual. I realized my obsession to be a good person had its roots not in a desire to be kind to others, but a desire to feel good about myself and to gain the approval of others. When I obsessed about whether or not I was a sadist, it wasnt out of empathy of those I may hurt, but because a sadist isnt very likeable. I also realized that I wanted to be more than just a ""good"" person. I wanted to be perfect. Perfect looks, perfect personality, perfect interests, perfect beliefs. I wanted people's approval and I wanted it more than anything else. It was the only concrete thing about me. This insatiable appetite for attention and to know that I was one of the good ones. The good people the world, someone above everyone else. In addition, I realized that I really didnt love or feel connected to anyone in my life. Not my friends or my family or my pets. I started to panic. The image of the person I used to be crumbled before my eyes, and from it's remains rose a monstrosity. There were so many things about me that were downright shameful and I couldnt cope with it. I couldnt cope with the idea I was a bad person. It turned me inside out and sent my emotions spiraling. Everything I thought I knew about myself was a lie. I was reduced to nothing but a pile of pitiful flaws loosely taped together into the shape of a person. I had no real personality, no real beliefs. It had all been picked up from those around me in a shallow attempt to become more appealing. I couldn't THINK for myself. I depended on others to tell me literally EVERYTHING about myself. My self hatred skyrocketed. I felt unstable. I couldnt stop thinking, my mind was constantly racing. I needed to prove to myself that I wasnt bad, that I could be redeemed and still be loved. I desperately needed to be loved. My emotions began to constantly pingpong back and forth between intensely hopeful and euphoric highs to catastrophically painful lows. There was no in between. I was stuck between deluding myself into thinking Im capable of becoming better and realizing that I might just be rotten to the core. Everything about me fell into this constant state of flux. I got more self destructive. More judgmental and spiteful towards others. But the worst part was my empathy. At first I thought it had vanished, but I realized that it may not have ever really been there in the first place. I still had empathy, but it felt so... inhibited. Perhaps by own selfishness, or maybe my self hatred. I dont know. All I did know is that I was so... numb towards the suffering of others. Not only that, but where empathy shouldve been I only felt selfishness and hatred. I was truly. beginning to devolve into a miserable little creature. When I asked myself whether or not I was capable of committing despicable acts, time and time again I couldn't truly answer. It began to feel like I didnt care about hurting other people. To me, it felt like the only thing standing between me and committing a felony was my own laziness and self preservation. Thats how it felt, at least. Its like my mind had been split in two. One side was evil. Hateful. A monster. While the other was desperate to go back to the way I was before. To feel loveable again. In order to do that I felt as though I had to become an real, genuine empathetic person. But the more I tried, the more impossible it felt. I felt too selfish, too fixated on feeling good about myself rather than showing genuine love towards anyone. To show love towards other was to sacrifice myself, and to sacrifice myself... something about it was so terrifying. But I couldnt give up. I kept trying to find the good human in me, to pull it out. But nothing seemed to work, and I only got worse. There were plenty of times where I felt so drawn towards accepting my darker self. To cry out: ""Im not the problem, youre all the problem!"" I just wanted to feel whole again. I wanted it so bad. I was starting to get drawn towards darker communities. I never interacted with them, but they lingered in the back of my mind. My mind was always eager to remind me that there was no point in fighting. That it was it was impossible. Heres the thing... I think it's right.

As I am now, Im detatched, depersonalized, horribly insecure, self destructive, depressed, anxious, borderline delusional, and emotionally unstable. Whats worse is I dont even really think I have an identity. Im trying to build a person but it feels like Im missing half the pieces. I hate who I am. I hate how cynical and judgemental I am. I hate being stuck between two emotional extremes. I hate how it feels next to impossible to do anything out of the goodness of my heart. If I dont feel like a good person, a likeable person.. then I dont even see the point of living. I want to be someone else, but people like me... I dont know, man. I truly do feel rotten to my core. I don't think I can change. To me it seems like my only option is to just be awful, or be delusional. I cant cope with the shame of who I am. I just CANT. I have so much to be ashamed of and every day the list only gets longer. The worst part is I know deep down I dont wanna be kind and loving for the sake of it. I just want my precious approval back. To feel good about myself again. I remember when my dad was terribly sick, I wouldnt even let myself feel bad about it because I felt as though I didnt deserve. I could hear a cacophony of laughter in my head. All the people I admired laughing at my suffering.

I'll say this, i definitely do have OCD. I do have intrusive thoughts. I do self analyze myself to hell and back and blow everything out of proportion. But Ive never seen an OCD case where someone is THIS bad. It just makes me think theres something else going on, that OCD isnt the main issue here. It feels like theres genuinely something dark and twisted inside me. Nowadays if Im not bouncing back and forth between depression and euphoria, Im just empty. Numb. Every day Im battling myself and every day I get closer to giving up."
1282,please help,"i can’t take the anxiety for much longer, i know the thoughts aren’t true and they’re just thoughts but they feel so real. i can’t stop thinking about them. it’s been going on since april and i want it all to end. please help."
1283,I just realized I might be a victim of emotional incest,"I really hope this kind of thing can be posted on this sub.

So I'm freaking out about this. I'm 32 and I still live with my mother, and it wasnt until tonight that I finally googled what my relationship with her was. Obviously it's nothing sexual, but we've always been a team for my whole life. We do everything together, and I really love her, but it's like..........that is not normal. I don't really want to write more because it makes me so upset. So I'm a mess and I think I've finally got the name for that mess. I'm so embarrassed and I can't leave my apartment I dont make enough money to live anywhere else. I'll be searching for a counselor soon, but I needed to get this off my chest to someone."
1284,"It's very frustrating that the more ""put together"" you seem, the less emphasis people seem to put on meeting your emotional needs or care about your mental health.","I've had this happen my entire life - from a young age, if I was a good student in a class, my teachers would just intentionally pair me with problematic kids for projects. This isn't just an assumption - I asked a teacher once why she kept pairing me with students that didn't like to do their work, and wanted to spend the whole time in class that we were assigned to work on our projects on goofing off. She told me, ""You just do so well with the work, and other students like you, so I put you in a group with them because I just know you'd be so good with helping!"" Except these students didn't want help, but for me to do the entire project for them. This happened over and over again, and even continued into my adult life. 

I also spent a few years of my life homeless. I worked really hard, with the help of some organizations and very kind strangers (no one ever does this on their own!) and made a life for myself. I had a physically, mentally, and emotionally abusive narcissistic parent (the cause of my homelessness) and have had some pretty rough things happen. Whenever people are going through similar things, and they ask me for my advice, they end up dismissing my help. ""u/CaliBounded, you could do this sort of thing because you're *strong*. Your brain works differently from other people.""

That's the part that throws me into a rage. When people just volunteer me for shit because I seem like I have my life together, or think that I'm well-rounded, they just write off the fact that I got this way through sheer effort. I was not ""born with"" a different brain from others. It makes it seem like I got here from some secret genetic superpower or something when I just tried really hard, and struggled the entire time that I tried. None of what I've accomplished came easy to me, and people just put me on a pedestal and let me assume more responsibility and pressure because ""I'm stronger than I look"" or some stupid bullshit like that. I had a 4.0 in my programming bootcamp (our courses counted for college credit) and I've had teachers go, ""I know the student in your group project is being an asshole, but you're more mature than that - you can get through this."" without offering reprimand or to stop them. Just letting me handle it and piling more onto me because I'm ""so good at"" handling other things.

I've had people cheat on me, lie to me, steal from me, etc. and then have people tell me, ""Listen, you've been through so much - this really is something you'll get past. You've been through so much worse than some man breaking up with you. You're stronger than this."" It's super shitty because no one knows how much anything affects me. No one knows how much (or why) certain things affect me more than others. Just because I escaped an abusive parent doesn't mean that infidelity doesn't hurt. I've even had the very people that have hurt me (the people that have cheated) go, ""Look, I'm sorry, what I did was terrible, but you'll get through this. You've been through worse."" It's like everyone goes, ""This person has had tons of things thrown on their plate in the past and hasn't committed suicide yet - I'm sure I can just add my bullshit too and they'll also be fine.""

It's painful. It's terrible for people to keep doing this. One thing that's helping is me realizing that it's not that I NEED to have tons of people around me - this has made me vulnerable to meeting these types of people that can sense that I feel alone and codependent. It's literally been better to interact with less people and have the few people that I interact with be good people than dealing with several terrible people. Even if I have to be alone, it'd be scary, but I'm not trying to have more bad people enter my life. It's still painful though. I feel like the concept of me having mental health that needs to be maintained is a joke to people."
1285,Why do I feel so depressed to the level of being on the verge of crying after a night of no sleep?,"Whenever I get no sleep or just a few hours of sleep, my emotions get really bad. I get so depressed and think about things that make me want to cry. And otherwise feel very down. Why is this?"
1286,I don't know what I'm doing with my life,"My life feels stalled. And I suppose it is with COVID. All this time at home has me thinking too much. I haven't known what I've been doing with my life for a while actually. I spend all my time focusing on school because I can't deal with real life. I wasted time at community college. I graduated my with my BA and entered a MA program because I didn't know what to do with my BA. With COVID my research hasn't been able to move forward. I haven't responded to an email from my advisor from a few weeks ago where he asked me what I wanted to do. I failed a class this past semester which is bad for a grad student. I don't think it's going to be offered for another 2 years now and I'm supposed to graduate next Spring. When I'm not doing school stuff, I'm usually trying to fill my time with volunteering and keeping myself busy but that's not happening right now. 


I have no social life, before COVID either. I never really make friends with anyone in my classes. Last year I actually did but since COVID started I haven't really kept in contact with her. I just don't have anything to say. I have a girlfriend too. We've been together for 7 years but most of the time it feels like we're only together because we're used to each other and can't bother to find other people. Her social life is just as bad as mine and we've only had each other for the past 7 years. 


I'm worried it's going to end soon because she hurt me twice in the past few years and I haven't been able to let go of it. I forgave her but I still think about it. She said she was a horrible person for it but idk if I can trust her like I used to. We don't really talk much either. It's been a while since I've had a meaningful conversation with her. Our texts to each other during the day are short. When we spend time together we talk about nothing important or we hang out on our separate devices. I try to tell her about things happening in my life and I think I depress her. She's got her own mental issues and recently became physically ill and says that she's jealous of my life sometimes because I'm doing something with it by going to school. I know she's not happy with her life and I wish I could fix it but I can't and I feel like she's not happy with me either because if she was she wouldn't have hurt me those times. 


I don't have a real relationship with my family either. I barely talk to my older sister and I know I should. I feel like I only matter to my parents when I'm doing things for them. They hate it when I talk back and point out things they do wrong and my mom calls me stupid a lot over little things. My dad says I'm too lazy and I don't show ambition even though he ignores any of my academic achievements. It's only ambition if I'm doing something for him - managing his small company business or managing his real estate. 

I feel so alone most of the time and I wish I had someone who cared for me but I can't bother to put the effort into it. I don't like the life I'm living and I feel like most of the time I'm just going through the motions to get through the day. I'm getting closer and closer to 30 and I don't know what to do. I never expected to live to see 25 to be honest and now I'm past that. I'm wasting my youth in a dead end relationship and I'm too scared to live life so I'm stuck in academia. I just don't know what to do with myself and I'm just so depressed all the time to do anything."
1287,I dread nights and trying to sleep,"For the last month and a half since my boyfriend had to go back to the country he is from for the duration of this pandemic I've been living with my parents and sleep has become so much more difficult.

It was okay to begin with but now I'm at the point where I dont feel tired because my brain is constantly stressed. I hate it here, I always have, I feel like I have zero autonomy and every day feels like some kind of groundhog torture. I try everything to try to get to sleep but my thoughts wont stop.

It just feels like I'm constantly fighting a battle I cant win.

I feel so alone and miss my boyfriend. We are so good for each others mental health and wellbeing and without him I've lost who I am. I've lost my home, my love and everything I used to do to help my mental health. I have no idea what to do. Iy feels like there's nothing I can."
1288,"My symptoms, looking for direction","Basically I have this thing where I put on an extremely extravagant act. Everything I do is geared to make people see me in a certain way. It’s really weird and really hard to describe but I’ve created this new persona I guess you could say. I am unable to stop “acting” and be myself no matter how hard I try. I can’t talk or even type in my “real” voice anymore. 

Anyways I really hope there is someone who can relate and has advice for me.

I find that i am happiest when I make myself as distant as possible with other people and the real world. Things like playing video games, being on the internet, and getting high are when I feel like I don’t have this persona on and I’m a real person.

It’s become really painful for me to be in the real world because I’m not a person there. If I were able to wander the world completely alone then maybe things would be different and less painful for me.

On top of this I feel really distant all the time. I think this is my brains way of saying “I don’t like that stuff get me away”. So I’m never really 100% there because being even 50% there causes me pain.

I digress. I know these symptoms and this line of thinking is very weird and I know few people can relate. Sadly it’s my reality, if there is anyone who can relate you couldn’t possibly imagine how much it would mean if you were to send any advice, personal experiences, or get in touch."
1289,Is there a name for this type of behavior?,"Hi guys,

just as a quick disclaimer, this happened years ago and I‘m in a really good place right now, so this is really just for understanding what happened and no call for help. TW explicit description of some type of breakdown. 

I was going through a lot of stuff that was really traumatic and I was struggling with depression at the time. That day, a very very minor incident happened (failed my driver‘s test due to anxiety, they were all very nice about it) and I just ...physically imploded? 
When I left that car I started crying, but not really, just that there were waterfall-like tears streaming out of my eyes with no sobbing and I couldn’t see anything. This lasted for the entire day. Walking was really really challenging and exhausting physically but I tried to keep it together because I was still in public. 
When I got home I literally fell on the floor and then had to rush to the bathroom and vomit my soul out. After that my entire body started cramping up very painfully. I got very very sensitive to light and my hearing grew worse with everything making a dull pulsing sound and me hearing my blood constantly.
After that I started coughing constantly and feeling like I couldn’t breathe but there was nothing in my throat and I was shaking a lot and got incredibly cold. So I tried to walk to my room but everything was spinning and it took me ages to get up the stairs. I put the heating up and laid down under three blankets (in the beginning of summer) but I was still freezing and shaking and my entire body was just one big blotch of pain, this really dull kind that you feel when you hit a bone on something. At this point I could finally breathe again but only when I laid very still. I couldn’t sleep and I also couldn’t think so I kind of just laid there the entire day but I lost all feeling of time/ hunger/ tiredness. 
When my mom got home she tried to talk to me and I really tried to answer but it took me ages to understand what she was saying because the words didn’t make sense in that moment and my tongue felt really heavy and I had a hard time speaking or remembering any type of words. I remember that at some point a lot of time had passed and I had zoned out entirely and wasn’t sure whether I had gone downstairs to eat or whether I had fallen asleep and I was feeling entirely numb at this point, so I just decided to close my eyes and drifted off eventually.
The next day however, I was obviously still in a bad mental space and felt kind of like what I now feel when I‘m hungover, but other than that I was completely fine and none of the physical symptoms were there anymore.

I was just wondering if someone experienced this or if there’s a name for this? It never happened to me again but it’s deeply ingrained into my memory because this is the trippiest thing I ever went through and I have NO explanation for what on earth was going on with my body."
1290,"A good nights sleep is critical to your mental health - if you find yourself lying awake, a little meditation before bed can help you find peaceful, refreshing sleep","Insomnia can have a hugely detrimental effect on your mental health, especially if you regularly miss sleep. When we lie awake at night, we can frequently have stressful thoughts that prevent us from relaxing enough to drop off - meditating before bedtime can help to accept and let go of these difficult thoughts and feelings. Reducing caffeine and screen time along with regular mindfulness practice can help you sleep peacefully and have happier days.

1291,I think that there's something really wrong with me.,"Ok so I have always been very attracted to certain types of people, in school it was male teachers at least twice my age or any guy significantly older than me or someone that there would be a lot of scandal around me being with. Now I thought this was pretty normal until the dreams started, I constantly get dreams about these people or people that I trust Assaulting me. But now I get triggered into a panic attack when people stand over me or behind me. My friends have noticed that I jump at the slightest touch or noise and they found it strange that I can't remember anything from my childhood up till the age of about 9. It's just been getting worse over the last year until I had an episode that I can't remember, according to my friends I couldn't speak I was terrified and would only stand in the corner of the room or continually walk around looking over my shoulder and twitch and rub my hands and wrists. I don't know what to do, is this all in my head? Has this been caused by something? Why can't I remember it if it was something that happened? Any advice would be great."

1293,The BLM protests and social media posts make me feel crap,"Hear me out.

I'm a mixed race adult (white and black African) so I've dealt with a lot of the issues raised. In fact, I've dealt with more of these issues than I had realised.

I've gone my whole life thinking I had it easy, that racism isn't that prevalent, when in fact, I've just not noticed it because of how ingrained it is in our society. It's also brought up feelings of not belonging anywhere. White people have never seen me as one of them, while in Africa, I'm called white due to a paler complexion. Neither heritage wants me. I'm stuck in the middle, with no where to run, to feel safe. 

I'm not from the States, and I live in a small town so we haven't had any protests here. I'd have to travel to a city to take part, but because of covid and medical conditions (minor, but I have really weak lungs), I haven't been out and taken part.

I don't post on social media much but there's so much pressure to be heard that I share the occasional post. My sister text me saying that she feels she isn't doing enough for the cause, but she lives with our sick mum.

I try to escape through games, but it somehow finds a way to be made aware.

I'm numb. Not the same numb that my depression causes, its a new numb. I'm not numb to myself but to society.

It doesn't help that my boyfriend doesn't believe white privilege is a thing, he's foreign but white. He gets the racial slurs, and understands the racism and supports the movement, but doesn't think he has any privilege.

And don't get me started on colourism. That's a whole other issue that apparently doesn't form BLM. 

This probably didn't make sense, I guess I just needed to vent a little.

Does anyone else feel the same?"
1294,What moment made you realise you had more Emotional Inteligence than your parent(s)?,"For me, when I was 8 and my Dad was hitting on a waitress who was visibly uncomfortable... (I was embarrassed and ashamed)."

The founder of this site resigned as a statement to his daughter. Yet I feel like it's a personal slight because he tells people like me we're less than.

1298,Is it worth it to see a psychiatrist?,"I told a few people close to me that i want to kill myself, that i am angry all the time, that almost every day i have a mental breakdown, that i hate everyone around me and i want to beat them into the ground, and i know i'm fucked up but what good will it do for someone to tell me something i already know, plus i'm worried that if i get help that they will put me on drugs until i dont know myself or rather make the situation worse."
1299,How do you control anger ?,"Is there anyway that could make this easier for me. 

I suddenly have sudden urges to beat someone up. And then I cry because I even think about it. 

I also get really angry after my friends do something that is really fucking annoying and even my sister. I want to know how to control my anger, so people can assume that I'm calm and a nice person. 

I want to fake being a happy person  when I go back to school because I've told too much secrets to people I don't even trust anymore and I want them to forget about it somehow. I have been miserable for so long and still am but I want to have new friends and to get rid of my old self which everyone knows me as.

Any suggestions?"
1300,Hoooow do I stop seeing Mary Jane ? I am DESPERATE to feel better without my daily spliffS routine,"Hello people! I hope you’re all safe &amp; sound.
Long story short:
I started using cannabis regularly around summer 2016, I then went on to smoking daily alone &amp; the habit stuck even harder when I got diagnosed with a CML. It’s a cancer that will never truly go, and I guess I have been coping with the symptoms, the diagnose, &amp; my depressive tendencies pre-cml. I want to mention I have been bullied at school at the age of 13/4 by my two best friends and I guess it had affected me a lot since.

When I don’t smoke I’m cranky, I have mood swings and I can’t tolerate anything/one in this world. I tried quitting then I convince myself that there is no point?? I have chemo brain + weed brain, I can’t remember shit, I am slowly regaining my balance through roller skating but my memories, my words, my brain have all slowed down. I still assimilate a lot of things but I’m afraid to be coping with my sadness with weed. At the moment I feel well because I have money, but when I have no money and can’t buy weed I’m miserable.
I’ve been trying to instaure/invest in this that can actively keep me busy when I am broke. Whilst writing this, I definitely firmly believe I’m addicted. I tried to stop soooo many times I cannot 😭 I need help. I stopped smoking with tobacco so that’s already something, I just still see the joint as a reward for going through the day or to go through the day. I pity myself, it’s like I have no self control yet I’m in charge of what I inhale, smh. 
Guys if you have any solution pleaseeee share them, I’m desperate, the cancer is already so much energy, I need to stop losing some through cannabis. 
Love green but I love and miss my absorbing sponge of a brain. I want to lose the daily habit and make it rare / non existent."

1304,"I feel as if someone disappeared, and its ruining my life","I am posting this here because I do not know where else it would be appropriate. I dont have too many friends. My total friend group consists of me and seven other people, but last week when we all met up to play video games I felt the strangest feeling I have ever felt. While I was casually hanging out with them I felt as if someone was missing. And not as in that feeling of you just wishing one of your other friends was there. No I mean that I felt as if one of my friends had been ripped away from this universe along with all memories of them. And now I'm stuck with this feeling that someone who I once knew has just someone completely disappeared. It's so hard to actually explain and I dont expect many to understand. But I just get this feeling that there is a missing link but I can't remember anything about them, only that it feels like they should be there but they aren't. 

Now I suffer from depression and when I asked my friends about this situation they thought I was having some sort of weird episode. But I swear this feeling is real and I've been stuck with it ever since I first felt it and it's taking a heavy toll on me. It has severely increased my depression and anxiety and I honestly dont know what to do at this point. Should I go to a doctor? Even if I do, what do I tell them? That I feel as if someone close to me has been torn away from our universe but that I cant remember anything about them? It just doesnt make sense but I cant keep going like this. I made this account just to ask people of this community for help since this is the only thing I can think of. I hope that everyone can take me and my situation seriously and that you can give me honest and helpful advice. Thank you."
1305,I think I might have Major Depression,"So I've noticed recently, that I have been feeling really low but a kind of hyper at the same time. I thought it was bipolar for a while, but I noticed the mood swings weren't as aggressive and frequent.

I appear to have all the symptoms of major depression, I am absolutely terrified of talking about it while showing my face. I've always refused counselling because I'm not comfortable having a regular conversation.

I've never wanted to take any kind of medication, because I don't want it to change who I am. I don't want to be like this, but I can't do anything about it."
1306,Minor inconveniences,"[idk if this should have a trigger warning on it or not] This is a genuine question, how come minor inconveniences make me want to k*ll myself but actual traumatizing events don’t? For example, I can get really upset about someone saying an off comment to me but one time I seen a body bag get wheeled away on a stretcher one morning and I didn’t have the same emotional reaction. Yes I was sad and cried but, it’s not the same as what some minor inconveniences do to me?"
1307,"(TW: suicide, family pain) I just wrote this slam poem in 5 minutes to explain how I'm feeling please feedback I need to hear some sanity","  

As young as 6 us kids boys were intimidated 

called every name under the sun

Our mother a scummy cunt she said “council house scum”

I swept it under the rug except when the schools were concerned

Talking to an autistic child like that isn’t abuse? when will they learn

It must hurt to have so many bad memories I thought;

I left it alone – she’s moved on now with Dad ‘the kids’ and a home

My brothers asperges is a delusion merely Munchausen-by-proxy

Vilified for wanting to work with computers called boring

Don’t look at that screen it will make your brain numb

Watch Big Brother, Celebrity Jungle and Piers Morgan

Stop taking your pills, stuff upper lip, just get on with it

Tell that to a person who’s overdosed in front of HIS mum

when you said meds are shit – that’s not guilt free 

The words that I must have sent that night are not me

Or how I speak to any human being

I know you’ve never cared about my mental health

Nor believed it 

But I have borderline personality 

It comes with amnesia when I switch and as with all cases

Of this shit mental disease it manifested after going to dark places

13 stitches in my arms, overdosed cut my throat

Blood spilling out of towels, face down passed out alarm bells

There’s some other shit they diagnosed me in the hospital too

But honestly I know its all fake to you

The amount of damage your words have done

Don’t match mine not even one

Perhaps not you see that is not how you care for a child

Now you’re giving out phones, consoles and splitting up a family

Because you’re always right except not in reality

My father I still believe is a good man

But on the phone after the messages

He confirmed from which my mind had ran

‘The kids’ doesn’t include me

If you think about it I was just forced family

A relic from a toxic relationship

That even after 26 years still remains hatred 

I’m so sorry for the dark shit that happened

It’s a trauma no one needed that

But then it occurs to me that no one even said are you okay

When we found out my best friend was dead

Did anyone drive over or give lifts to Toms funeral?

Or was everyone busy letting my brother shoot up

Cast out like a freak that could have been his fentanyl 

That could have been his funeral

If you can’t understand how some one grows up

Goes through all this emotional suffering

And ends up in a state finally saying something

Then you truly need to take an honest look at yourself

I’m trying to get better, no more messages

Maybe the occasional letter

The biggest insanity when we spoke dad about this

You never asked me how my brain is

You know I’m not the type to bring down mental health

So why didn’t you ask if I needed some help?

That behaviour as you should know

Is self-destructive and suicidal 

But it wont be the kids if I go?"
1308,Do I do too much or am I just weakminded,"I hear from a lot of people that i do to much, but i never had a full time job and notice myself not being really productive throughout the day. I'm always struggling with feeling like I'm lazy and productivity is a huge theme in my life (in which I'm mostly failing, in my own opinion) 

I set apart all things I've experienced throughout the last 5 years, and i wanna hear what you think. I think there is more, but these things are at the top of my head rn. 
I'm struggling with my mental health rn, and i wanna check if it's bcs of my turbulent lifestyle or bcs I just can't handle much. 

- I've written 3 books, struggling with getting published
- tried for many short story competitions, which i had high hopes for, but not winning anything 
- had acting classes and tried out for a lot of acting jobs which i really wanted to make money with, getting at least 400 rejections 
- tried at least 15 (regular) jobs which I all hated, walked away or was fired after 2-4th shift 
- switched study 5 times, not completing anything 
- made 2 short films (directed and written) , working on a 3rd one rn
- started a feature film script, being written by someone else but I'm directing him (I'm gonna direct the film later) 
- started a film company, but haven't found the right producer to help me get it off the ground
- had 2 love relationships, both approx. 9 months 
- was paranoia for a whole year (this was kinda traumatic) bcs of using cocaine and speed a few times. Thought my house was infested by fleas for a year long, and actually feeling itches and seeing them jumping (which where hallucinations) 
- moved houses 6 times, with the last one being bcs of a huge fight with my roommates
- my grandmother passed away 3 months ago, she was a huge part of my life
- I'm 26 and i live with my mom rn, i feel like shit."
1309,Tapering off Prozac,"Has anyone tapered off Prozac before? I am 26f, married, I am also a mother to a 3 year old. I had an eating disorder ages 12-22. I started taking Prozac age 22 and it helped immensely for anxiety and depression and helping me view my body in better light. I started at 20 mg. Then I had my daughter and I had to bump up to 40 mg due to ppd and more intrusive ocd thoughts (triggered by pregnancy hormones but it has stayed with me now). I have been wanting to try coming off my meds completely. I want to make sure I am coming off for the right reasons. I will add that I work in mental health and I see a lot of my clients come off their meds because they think they’re doing well. Only to realize they were only doing well BECAUSE of their meds. How do I know I am wanting to come off meds for the right reasons? Also, might be TMI but Prozac completely killed my libido initially. It’s back now (not as strong as it used to be) and I have to work hard to orgasm. I would like to enjoy sexy time without having to try so hard each time. 

Anyone can answer, I would especially like the input of other mothers."
1310,Should i believe the nightmares i have,"I took a nap and woke up from the worst nightmare ever, cold sweats and everything. I got a letter from my bf in the dream where it was him telling me i was a manipulator, shittiest gf ever, a list of all the things we did together and what was wrong with them, and in the end told me to go die or go kill someone if im not going to killmyself. I had an extremely toxic friendship earlier in my life and i was manipulated to all hell and I would never do that to anyone, moreso my bf.

1312,I'm feeling trapped and I need advice,"Warning- Sexual abuse mentioned

I'm stuck in the house. My boyfriend went on a day trip and I've been counting down the minutes until he returns. I have the baby and the car seat and we went out earlier but she was cranky and exhausted so I had to bring her back home quickly. I feel trapped in this house and I need to get out.

I have issues with needing to be able to escape or hide ever since I was younger due to severe abuse (I was physically, mentally and sexually abused by my father at a young age). Yet, it had worsened after my ex. I wasn't allowed to leave the house or have a job. The one time I walked outside without his permission (we had an argument and I needed air) he stood in the door way, counted down from 3, threatened me like a child and when I came inside he forced me down, threw himself on me, grabbed my face and screamed at me to moan because I wasn't enjoying him. Then, when he was done, left me on the couch alone to sleep for the night only to return the next morning. When sharing a bed, I couldn't even move because if I did, he would either try and push himself on me or choke me. 

When I left him, I went homeless (I didn't know I was pregnant yet) and those 3 days before I learned I was pregnant was the happiest I had ever felt. I could go anywhere, I wasn't stuck, I didn't have to return to the same place every night or be stuck in a small trailer for weeks on end. I felt happy. I felt free.

Now, I get terrible anxiety when I can't easily just leave for many hours on end. My boyfriend leaving for over 12 hours and me being stuck because I have to prioritize (She will always come first.) my child is just sending me through the roof.

I tried writing out my frustration. Drawing. Taking a nap. Playing games. Playing with my daughter. Going on a drive with her.... But I just can't shake it. I need to leave. I need to get out. I want to take a walk and hide behind the park where no one can see me but I can't. 

I'm thinking about making myself a hiding spot in the house so when I get the urge to hide I can go there... But we have very little room and I just don't know how that would work."
1313,I'm so tired.,"It's nearly been a year since I started feeling this way. I spent a lot of time trying to work things out on my own, and all that did was make it worse.  I've always had a good support system around me, friends, family, etc, but I could never find the words to describe whats going on. This last year of my life has been going steadily downhill.

My parents divorced the year before and I was able to work through that, but for some reason, I haven't been able to shake this god awful state of mind.

It feels bad ALL the time. Everything's been normal, no big traumatic events, I still get on with my friends and love my parents dearly, and yet I wake up most days wishing that I hadn't.

I all but gave up on college, but I was still able to scrape some half-decent grades. I'm going to university, 2nd in my family to ever do that, and my dad told me how proud he was of me. I feel like an imposter, I don't deserve to be where I am and feel like this.

I have by no means had a hard life. It's been good, but I spent today thinking about topping myself, and I feel so fucking selfish for that.

2 weeks ago I finally got the nerve to talk to my girlfriend about how I've been feeling, and it felt better to tell someone. I broke down while explaining the way I've been thinking and the things I've been thinking about doing. We broke up the week after that. Honestly, it was definitely for the best as we weren't good for each other anymore.

I'm angry at everything and everyone, the last good night of sleep I had was before the new year.

I miss the distractions, even on my worst days I at least had a lesson at college or my job to take the edge off. I was 2 weeks away from taking my driving test and getting my first taste of real freedom.

Since lockdown started over here in the UK, I've had nothing to put my mind towards, and now the bad days keep getting worse and more and more frequent.

I'm so sick of having this internal struggle with myself, trying to find something or someone to keep pushing me through and coming up blank. My life hasn't even started yet and I can't wait for it to be over.

After we split I told my parents most of what was going on, I cant tell them about what I thought about doing though. I couldn't bear to see the look on their faces if they knew.

My mum gave me the contact details for a counselor, but I can't bring myself to phone them. I know that whatever the fuck is going on in my head isn't normal and that I need help. I still can't justify wasting someone else's time on my stupid bullshit.

I'm drinking a fair bit these days. I can easily get through a bottle of spirits in an evening. I'm not dependent on it and never have been but I'm worried that it's getting out of control. It feels good to not be in my own head for a while.

I want to feel like me again, I want to sleep, I want my life to start, and I want to be around long enough to live a good one, but I don't think I'll see my 20s if I keep going like this.

If anyone has any advice on what I can do, please, I need help."
1314,Decreasing Sertraline/Zoloft,"Okay, so I know now isn’t exactly the ideal time to alter my meds (pandemic, protests, etc.) but I’ve been afraid of being on a high dose for too long. I took 150 mg of Sertraline (Zoloft) per day for maybe 3 years or so. I thought that due to my new living situation, job, etc. maybe I could decrease (and eventually stop) the drug. I talked to my doctor and she suggested I go down to 100 mg per day for a month and see how I feel. 

I’ve been at 100 mg for 2 weeks now and I’ve been feeling an undercurrent of anxiety coupled with nausea. Have any of you decreased your dosage and experienced something like this? How long did it last? Did anything help alleviate the effects? I know this is all on Google, but I can’t find a lot of personal anecdotes (which helps my anxiety more than stuff like, say, statistics).

1319,ERP making HOCD feel more real than ever.,"
So I'm doing ERP and I was super convinced I was gay. But right before I did an exposure I noticed a body sensation I always felt with girls and that reassured me (probably not helpful) and then I did my exposure right after. Then that one thing changed. Basically it was this quality about my body sensations when it came to sexuality but it changed immediately and went away and felt like I was switching out what fake attraction felt like with what real attraction felt like. It’s just super scary and I’ve never been this convinced before.

Now I feel like I used to towards girl but towards guys. I feel super super stuck and I don't know at all what to do. I don't even remember what it's like to like a girl. Even when I look back into previous relationships and crushes, I feel nothing. This has never happened before, I don't know what's going on.

Does anyone relate or possibly know why this could have happened?"
1320,I think I need to get mental health support but I don't want to waste people's time so I was looking for any advice,"With everything that's going on in the world I know that the NHS is really struggling so I don't want to use resources unnecessary but I think that I do need some form of help.

I really suffer socially, I second guess every word that leaves my mouth or type in a message so half the time I just don't say anything at all as I worry about how people will react or feel as I hate the idea of insulting or offending people, especially people I don't really know which makes making new friends really difficult.

I am really bad at keeping in touch with people, there's been many occasions where I'll suddenly just stop talking to friends and family for 2-3 months at a time and then get back in touch out of nowhere and although they all welcome me back openly I know it's still a really bad way to treat people but I just can't seem to help it.

I don't really like being around people a lot of the time so most of the time I just stay in and listen to music on my own and then get agitated when people are around.

I have a really short fuse and my temper can get the better of me so I have to distance my self from others regularly to avoid lashing out and offending or pushing people away. This happens the most at work when I have a really bad/difficult job to complete and I can sense that my boss and the receptionist are judging my abilities and capability at my job.

I hate most things about myself pretty much all of the time for example my appearance, intelligence and personality. I genuinely believe I'm really ugly and that nobody will ever find me attractive physically but my personality is also so bad that I don't think I'll ever have a happy relationship. I don't have anything in my life that I can genuinely say I'm good at or  enjoy doing. I feel I have absolutely no personality like when people tell jokes I have to fake laugh pretty much every time as my heads either in a completely different place so I haven't heard it or I don't find them funny so I just pretend to laugh because I don't want to offend them.

I have trust and abandonment issues as most of my family have either left me behind and done a runner or they been taken from me so I get scared at the thought of getting close to people because as soon as I do it's almost like a feeling that it's only a matter of time before they've had enough and leave.

My dad did a runner when I was 15 which has probably done more harm than I care to admit but not because of him as a person but the fact that up until that point I'd been raised under a false illousion that I had a real family structure around me that I could rely on but then you learn that your dad doesn't give a damn about you and that he actually resents me being born as he hated sharing my mum's attention with a child so he held it against me throughout my childhood. My Mum doesn't know or care about me at all, we live together as I'm only on Apprenticeship income so I can't afford to move out yet but she doesn't talk to me about how I feel or anything about the things I'm into yet she'll talk about work for 2 hours without even blinking and then not say a single word afterwards. She's always threatening to just up and disappear because she doesn't think she has anything to stick around for even though she has 2 children, 2 granddaughters and 2 grandsons in law. My sister, niece's, nephews and grandma are the only family I truly have to rely on and care for as sadly my grandad passed mid April so I've had to be the glue pulling everyone together after seeing him the day before he died barely being able to eat and unable to sleep which was really difficult as he was a real old school man's man who I looked up to as an example of the kind of man I wanted to grow up to be.

My sister is incredible and one of the reasons I almost feel ashamed to say that I might need help as  she's been through a lot more than I have which I won't go into here as they aren't my stories to tell but that fact she still pushes on and is such a kind hearted, beautiful and honourable human being is just inspirational.

Ultimately I just don't really know what to do, I want to be a better person and be a closer resemblence to  the confident, excited and energetic person that I used to be as a kid but I don't want to waste people's time so I just thought maybe posting my feelings here might mean that you guys might be able to give me some advice on where to go from here.

Thanks everyone and stay safe"
1321,Anger and Fear,"F(18) I broke up with my ex-boyfriend who had been coercing me into sex, completely destroyed all trust, my body image, and my mental stability.

I fear I’ll panic and either completely shut down or attack him. I’m in therapy but my appointment are minimal due to the pandemic. I’m scared, what if I can’t do it anymore.

Does anyone suffering Bipolar II have any advice for medication? I have been asked to look into Lamotrigine and Quetiapine.

I'm very weary of medication. I was initially put on Citalopram (other than intestinal bleeding, weight loss and brain zaps, did nothing to help) and Sertraline (gave me insanely high, persistent mania, psychotic episodes, awful vivid nightmares and ongoing brain zaps post ceasing medication) also did nothing to help.

1324,Am I depressed?,"Hey redditors I'm quite new to this sub and I'm on mobile so forgive me.This is also a bit of a vent so pls have patience in reading :)

So I(16M) have been struggling with this for a while now, I'm not sure if I have depression,need help, or I'm too sensitive. This all began back in school, about a year or two ago, I had made new friends in my 3rd year of high school(before that I had no friends and was usually lonely) and these new friends were pretty cool for the first few months, we shared alot of laughs and we had fun, but later into the year, I realised that my friends were laughing at the cost of me being hurt. I used to annoy certain friends in our friend group so that other friends would laugh (I was the funny friend), but when I used to harass them, it would usually follow with a punch(that hurt and bruised), but the friends laughing didn't care and kept encouraging me to do it again, and I did to keep everyone happy.

After realising this, I stopped being the 'funny friend' I would act more mature and not do any stupid stuff in hopes that my friends would respect me more, but instead I just got walked over more, my friends literally pushing me around, slapping stationary out if my hand and making me pick it up, kick me over when I was on the floor, this would make others in the friend group laugh, others said that was uncalled for, but this hurt me a lot, combined with no one to talk to at home,and only ever playing video games(it was the only thing I was good at) made me feel awful,useless,pathetic I used to have these sudden outbursts of anger(usually when I lost at the videogame)where I would strangle or punch myself because I thought I deserved it.

Me being walked over daily turned me back into the quiet kid I was a few years prior, and I would just daydream and let myself be walked over by the 'fake' friends, I wished I could die, and sometimes ended up praying that God would kill me in my sleep, this was when I would remember how my best friends stopped responding, we used to game together but I stopped talking since I was stressed with exams, and so our communication died out, but I had really good times with them.

I've not been the same person I was since highschool, I used to be funny and energetic before, now I'm more quiet and have a more 'it is what it is' mindset but I do talk a little more now, I guess going back to my original question, is this normal for a teenager? Do I have depression? Am I too sensitive? How do I cope and go back to the 'normal' and 'original' me 

TL:DR my school friends walk over me and push me around, my gaming(and some of the best) friends leave me, I strangle and punch myself, I have no one to talk to, look at the questions above"
1325,"I feel like, I am not a pleasing character. So try very hard to please everyone.","I don't know how to talk well, am very bad at small talks. I am an introvert, but I badly want to please everyone.
During my teenage days, I found helping is a good way to please. So I try to help everyone even neglecting my own needs. I find it hard to say a 'NO'.
Yesterday, I felt very sad when I felt, even with all my 'helping' , I am not a favourite of others at my work place. Somebody who talks better and almost always says 'NO' and find excuses, seems to be more comfortable and good friend of my co-workers. How to get friendship bof my co-workers?

My dears, Can you please give me some insights?"
1326,Back to Work Anxiety after Quarantine,"These past 3 months we have been out of the office because of community quarantine. Our employer is still actually giving us half our salary even if we do little to no work since we were not prepared for Work at Home scenario. The problem is I have worked myself in so much anxiety that whenever i imagine being called back to work, my chest gets cold and i dont breathe normally. I dont like my job and I am aware of how much things we have left pending because of the no work period. Thinking about it makes me want to puke. I think I’m putting too much pressure on myself already that it’s manifesting physically. I’m having a hard time stopping what I feel. I keep distracting myself using anime and internet from the reality of the situation because my physical reactions are so bad. I feel like I’m such a baby over this because I’ve always been more comfortable being at home. I’m aware that it’s just me overreacting but I think I already have a bigger problem."
1327,My Girlfriend Gets Sad Every Time She Drinks,"We've been together for roughly 5 months. She's 20 and I'm 21 (legal drinking age is 19 here). We're both in university but currently back in our own hometowns due to COVID-19. I don't really know how to approach her about her mental health and drinking.

She tends to drink alone at night. Her parents don't really know how much she drinks. They are okay with her having a couple of drinks but she tends to drink too much. I'm not against her having fun. Whenever she's drunk, she calls all lovey-dovey at first. I genuinely enjoy calling her but after some time, she gets very apologetic and sad. I know a lot of people apologize for small things when they are drunk. She apologizes for her body, or that she's not good enough. I always support her and show her love. It helps her out that night and she's happy that she's reassured. She's really sensitive and cares a lot about what people think about her. I get that. It just gets super amplified when she's drinking.

I don't know what else I should try to help. Reassuring her works for the night but it starts all over again next week."
1328,I think I might have existential dread but I don't want to self-diagnose.,"It's like the title says. I feel like life just has no meaning. No matter what I do, I won't have any lasting impact. Even if all of humanity banded together the most we could possibly fuck up or improve is this solar system, and even that is a stretch of feasibility. And the universe is infinite so there's trillions of other galaxies that are the exact same and we will never have an impact on them. Good or bad. If humanity as a whole can't do that much then what could I accomplish on my own? I just feel like this all the time but I don't want to self diagnose due to the stigma associated with doing so, and I don't wanna ask my parents to go see a therapist or something. I just don't know what to do anymore."
1329,Finally started the long trip of fixing myself. At 23,"So I’ve been terrified of getting help. Reasons most possible  from medical neglect and a lot of gaslighting from my family . So I down loader firefly health. I wanna tell my story. Maybe I’ll stop at some point or maybe not even post again . But maybe I can get some one to start the process of getting help too. 

So I downloaded the app put in my insurance name and other info. Made a video appointment and forced myself to do it after having the app for a month. Got connected with a doctor that same day. 

Now my childhood was filled with my mother manipulating is kids against each other . And having an abusive father and brother and kinda sis ( don’t know how I feel about her)  so made me an appointment m with a social worker . I laid it out. Every trans I could think of I told her my life story and she heard me. She told “ of course your scared your life was in danger your whole life!” To hear that what I went threw was actually fucked up and it wasn’t all in my head was great. 
I was shaking the whole time. She was super nice and she walked me threw it. Like heals my mental hand threw talking and learning . She’s going to look into financial help for me and some  thing like a mental care think that’s from 9 to 2 for like 2 weeks. So they can monitor me and try some meds. She also wants to set up a therapist while I’m in there so that I can keep going right when I’m done. So she told me she’s gonna look into it and get back to me. I’m so scared. But I can’t go threw life having my energy being sucked by my past . I would be me until I get threw this. I can’t grow as a person without this. 


Im sure by next week ima be a chicken and not want to show up for the appointment but dam right now I have hope. 

What you are feeling.... makes sense.... there’s reasons and since there’s reasons the fixes. So tell yourself to hold on . Make that appointment . Or that call. Be open about what happened so they can know exactly what their working on. Even if your not sure still bring up what your thin you feel . And keep that train going and keep holding on and breathing"
1330,Has anyone felt unmotivated?,"So, for the past two years I have felt unmotivated and unable to concentrate on a task for more than 15 minutes. I used to enjoy studying and doing my homework but since my Junior year I’ve felt useless/unmotivated, loss of emotions, and unable to concentrate. I‘ve been thinking of making an appointment with my universitie’s health center but never go through."
1331,Am i just sad?,"These past few days i’ve been so emotional; crying frequently, feeling helpless, feeling stressed and tired and wanting to escape to the void, to the point where i denied hang out requests to keep from bringing them down. i want to say i’m just sad right now ‘it’s just temporary’. but it feels like it’s been like for so long. idk what to do"
1332,I feel bitter and angry at everything and I hate it. I wasn't like this before,"Ever since I graduated college I feel like I have changed for the worse. I'm angry at everything, snap easily, hate my job (which I used to be extremely passionate about, and it's what I went to college for) and I just hate the way I am becoming. I feel like I have no control over my emotions. I don't know why I am feeling this way. I just feel bitter and angry about everything and don't like anything about me. I'm mad that I don't have a lot of friends, which is something I never cared about before, but do now for some reason and I'm mad at the past and all the choices I've made. I just feel bitter about everything. 

I just have no idea what to do. How do you change your thoughts?"
1333,Why do I lose interest in absolutely everything after a certain amount of time?,"By no means am I depressed (I think), but for some reason and for a long while now, I've been losing interest in everything after a few weeks or so. Happens with my hobbies, relationships, etc. Sometimes I come back to the interests I've been passionate about for awhile, but they still aren't safe from me just dropping them for a few months and moving on to something else.


I got into chess recently and was really excited to learn the game. I wanted to improve my skills enough to beat my family and friends. I lost interest in improving and playing after one week. 


Does anyone know what this is and how to combat it? I can't force myself to suddenly enjoy chess or something like it again. I don't understand what this is :("
1334,Cry for help Need good advice,"I have really bad ADHD like 90th percentile on the tests. Lifes been really tough for me. Idk if maybe I have some social disorder too or ASD. Anyways Im super depressed, I have social anxiety and I thought it was because of my impulsivity/hyperactivity as a kid. But i recently got tested and im now only inattentive type. 

And i just like cannot function and I feel so hopeless. I dont even need to me normal I just desperately want to fit in. But im so awkward even the few friends i have notice. I dont know whats wrong with me. It’s especially tough during coronavirus lockdown because I don’t know how to text. I don’t understand what people want to hear or how often to text them and it makes my anxiety worse so ill just go without talking to anyone for weeks.

And don’t get me started on romantic relationships. I want to know what love is like but even if someone was dumb enough to be interested in me (im very physically attractive) I dont think i could manage the stress of a relationship. Its so devastating to me. Ive read everything i can find on social skills and gone to classes for them. Same thing for texting. Nothing helps

I see all these people on snapchat that ive met with their stories going out with friends and drinking or jusr having fun and it feels so unattainable. And I wish I could just focus on my classwork and be content with that, but you know ADHD and lack of concentration plus the severe depression from years of social isolation. 

Ive been taking different ADHD meds for years but I have a “sensitive brain chemistry” and meds dont really work for me. Please no advice like learn to be happy with what you have or life sucks. I don’t enjoy spending every night alone crying because i feel like im missing out on what it means to be alive"
1335,An episode of some kind..?,"So.. Uh.. I guess you could say an ""Episode"" of some kind happened to me and I'm still pretty anxious even if it did already pass. I don't know what happened but I ended up going into the washroom and blocking my ears or staring into one direction with no context. 

Here's what happened (From what I remembered) : I was in my room I think watching videos when all of a sudden I started smiling and lowly giggling. I was able to stop laughing but I kept smiling even when I tried to stop. This went on for around ten minutes or more when I decided to leave my room and go to the washroom.

When I got there I was able to stop laughing but instead I got a bit emotional and weirdly enough shed some tears. These didn't last long tho and I started to smile again but cooled down a bit later.

I did get anxious and suspicious that someone was watching me or that something was gonna happen and even heard some weird sounds.

(Basically I live somewhere where cars constantly pass from time to time and for some weird reason when ever they passed along with the sound of a car passing came a weird sound like a low pitched voice mixed with the sound of the car.)

Never happened to me before. Anybody know wether or not this is normal? (Most probable it isn't..) And if it isn't.. Any ideas?"

1338,"i want to die, but i also want to live. just not in the situation that i put myself in.","**TLDR: help me. tell me how to get out of this mess, how to graduate college, how to keep living every day. how did you get out of your own messes?**

**that bojack quote of ""every day it gets a little easier. but you gotta do it every day - that's the hard part. but it does get easier."" gets me through my darkest days, but then again i'll have to work hard every day to feel like a normal person. and that feels so exhausting.**

&amp;#x200B;

i fucked up big time - my college is going to suspend me for a year for failing out of classes this semester. i'm a senior. what a fucking joke. and i'm just so fucking exhausted and burnout and numb that i don't even *want* to try to fix this and do the schoolwork and graduate. i don't have the energy. my family will be so mad at me when they find out this happened. i go to one of the top schools in the U.S., and my parents are about a quarter mil in debt for it. i feel so guilty, so anxious, but still so numb to my situation. i want to kill myself because of this, and because of a flood of other issues in my life.

i've been falling deeper and deeper into my depression for the last year. shitty friends made my anxiety, ADHD, and depression so vicious, and i dropped the ball on classes, extracurriculars, internships, and social relationships. this has then been compounded by the anxiety of human life being altered forever because of corona, and the dread that nothing will change in america after these protests. i want to go into politics: work on mitigating and adapting to climate change; making society more economically equitable; expanding democratic participation; addressing the institutional and systemic forces that have made life so shitty for so many people; building up public transit systems and renewable energy and public libraries and national parks and and and. do good in the world. but i need a college degree for that.

fucking up like this is making me so suicidal, actively researching things when i've never let myself in my other darker days. i just don't know how to claw myself out of this mess and graduate.

i'm passionate about things, i find pleasure in things, i know i am loved by people. i'm on medication and finding a therapist, starting to workout more because i know it's good for my brain. but i worry that my mental health will always make me struggle like this, that i'll have good periods but then fall back into The Pit, that blackhole of self-loathing and regret and self-imposed social isolation and 14-hour depression sleeps and being paralyzed by anxiety and fucking up my responsibilities because of it, which makes me fall even deeper. 

i'm just so afraid that life will always be like this, and so then i think killing myself now will just make it better. but then on the other hand, i want to live so i can experience the good periods and do good in the world. but then again, living is so much *work.* and i'm so tired. that bojack quote of ""every day it gets a little easier. but you gotta do it every day —that's the hard part. but it does get easier."" gets me through my darkest days, but then again i'll have to work hard every day to feel like a normal person. and that feels so exhausting. i just don't know what to do.

1339,TW sexual harassment,"Note: I posted this on another subreddit but I guess I’m looking for more of some help healing and some validation 

I reported a long list of things someone was doing to me (physical and verbal) in a school team setting. The person got in a lot of trouble and confessed to a lot of stuff. She is no longer at the school. However, when I reported sexual harassment the “Human Resources” (idk what to call them) told me that it was unlike the person and the person later denied it. Some of their other actions they admitted to are on the blurry line between illegal and jerk. It’s been a year and the sexual harassment (verbally and socially pressuring me into being in situations where I was naked in front of them and potentially other ppl) has been dismissed and I have no evidence or witnesses. I have basically lied to everyone that I never mentioned the sexual harassment so I wouldn’t have to tell them it got dismissed. I feel like throwing up when I think abt it and I feel unsafe around her old friends. It’s consuming me that it happened and that I’ve lied.
Please help me"

1342,I just need to get this off my chest;,"I just need to get this off my chest; 

&amp;#x200B;

I am exposed to a lot of death in my job (law enforcement/investigator).

My grandfather died 5 years ago. He and I were very close. He had lung cancer and emphysema. I visited him one afternoon to take him a morphine inhaler from the chemist because my grandma couldn't drive and get it herself. The next morning I was at work and overhead the call for a death at their address over the radio. I knew straight away what it was and credit to my work - they made calls and got me straight over there to be with my family. I was devastated though. 

To make things worse, he'd passed away in the kitchen and was lying on his back in the hallway with a sheet covering him. His doctor wouldn't answer his phone which meant that the undertaker couldn't take him away. He lay like that for 5 hours while we had to sit in the next room before the undertaker could take him). I then helped my mum plan his funeral. 

Since then,  I have moved to a different section that requires me to attend a lot more deaths as part of my job. Its my teams responsibility to attend places where a person has died (by unknown natural causes, suicide, murder, accident etc) and look at the scene and determine if the death is suspicious. 

I started off fine, deaths are sad and all that but we get on. But then I found that when I would go home and lie in bed, I would start to think about what if I wake up and my father has died or my mother or brother or sister or partner. I would become really sad thinking about this and nothing I would do could make it stop. I would be lying in bed beside my partner and Id have to touch him to make sure he was breathing because I would lie there thinking that he was already dead beside me. Or I would have to lie awake because if I slept then I might wake up and he'd be dead. I never worried about myself, just everyone around me. 

In 2018, I attended the death of a 23 year old who had overdosed and died in his sleep. I still remember everything about it because he was the same age as my little brother. I had to look into his phone and see the messages between him and his family members planning weekends and telling each other how much they care for each other. 

After I left work, I drove home. It was late, and the lights were out and the second car was missing because nobody else was home. I sat in my car screaming and crying at the thought of going into that house and being in there alone and having to try and sleep. I ended up calling my mum who lived nearby, she calmed me down and I drove over to her place and sat and cried and told her everything. 

I never got help, I just bottled it up and pretended I was all better. 

I actually haven't had too many problems with it since then, but also I actively took steps to avoid going to deaths - I would make sure I was busy with something else so others would go, or I would refuse to go inside due to the smell, refuse to touch the body, won't talk to family etc.

I've just recently had a few set backs at work related to other anxieties. I finally came clean to a coworker I trust, who was horrified that I hadn't said anything, encouraged me to speak to a therapist about everything and then I told my boss about everything. 

To their credit, my work have been really good in trying to help me get back to 100%. 

My problem is that I don't know what to do with my therapist. I really like her and I feel comfortable telling her things about myself. She's helped me a lot with my other anxieties. 

But when I tried to explain about this, she told me I need to disassociate myself from the investigations and just remember that I'm there to do a job and the families pain isn't my pain. I think she misunderstood what I am experiencing and I struggled to explain it to her.   
it's actually caused me to go back to experiencing these feelings of dread and worry some nights so I'm very scared that its all going to start up again. 

I want to be confident that I'm being treated properly, and I don't want to change therapists, but I feel a bit like this problem was glossed over by my therapist. I'm also afraid that if we get right into it and I start talking about it with her, I'll be diagnosed with something serious and sent to a psychologist and put on medication and I won't be able to do my job anymore."
1343,I don't know what's wrong with me?,"This thing has been happening to me for almost 3 years and it's kind of hard to explain.

Some context: I have pleanty of good friends, a loving family and no much of economic or social problems. I'm not rich but I have all my needs covered. Despite this, I can't help but feel miserable sometimes. At first I didn't take that too seriously. I though it'd be because I was a teen. I had these periods of time when I could only lie on my bed and do nothing but cry. That's alright, I was feeling sad, but that's normal.

But that didn't last long. At first I felt sad, but it developed to feeling nothing at all. It's sudden, one moment I'm playing a game or reading a book I like, and the next one I lost all interest and joyment in what i'm doing. It's just... nothing. I don't feel anything at all. I think that in those moments i should feel miserable, sad or even scared of this, but i just can't. I'ts a weird emptyness stuck in my chest, that won't allow me to do anything, because I feel too lazy to. I don't feel like doing anything.

It can last from a few hours to weeks. I just got out of one that lasted an entired week. A week that I couldn't eat, attend to class, or talk. I couldn't even look at my family at the eyes. And whenever they asked me what was wrong, I could't answer, because I didn't know. I have no idea why this happens to me nor what do I do to avoid it. I know it'll end at some point but idk how much time would that be, or when it'll happen again. Since the year started these periods of time are more frecuent that before.

Going to the psychologist it's complicated right now as we can't go out, and I don't want to risk my family for such a needless thing. I don't want to cause more problems, but I don't know what to do either. I don't know what i'm looking for when I write this, as I know I'm not obtaining a solution from you all, but maybe it would be relieving to know that I'm not the only one with these desconections..."
1344,Can a 16 year old make and go to a doctors appointment without parents consent or knowledge?,"I’m a 16 year old Canadian girl. I live in the province of Alberta. My mental health just took a massive decline. I haven’t had any motivation, I just feel numb and get about 3-4 hours of sleep on good days. I take melatonin to help me sleep but it never really helped much (not prescription). My parents are very ignorant when it comes to mental illness. My father isn’t to bad but my mum is the one I’m worried about. I once tried to talk to her about these same symptoms about a year ago and she just told me “you sound like a crazy person” and “stop being so dramatic”. That felt like a punch to the gut. Fortunately my symptoms got better over time with the help of some friends, but made me wary of what I tell my mum. Now they are much worse (panic attacks, crying fits etc) and my best friend is really worried about me and worried I’ll get hurt or I’ll hurt myself. But I’m unsure of what course to take. Help"
1345,coping with being too attached to people/loving them more than they love you?,"it seems like every friend i have i seek a close, deep friendship. over the past year, i’ve fallen apart from my three closest best friends, and it feels like shit. especially considering all of my current friends don’t seem to want to be close with me, or value me as a friend. i’m not trying to make this post seem like a pity party, but it genuinely hurts so bad not to have a person in the world i can go to. even my older sister prioritizes all her other friends over me, which i expect from her but it still hurts. i just feel myself getting depressed at night with no one to go to, or desperately wanting an escape but no one to escape to. it’s unbearable."
1346,I feel like a burden to everyone around me,"So I've been diagnosed with autism if that has anything to do with this, but I feel like a burden to everyone around me and I have no idea. So for some more back ground information i think I've had depression (although i never sought help and it was never diagnosed so for lack of a better term) I actually did cut myself previously and attempted suicide, but then i made some friends and all of that stopped I was happy.  About a month later I started to feel less happy and more empty and these thoughts of me being a burden to my friends started.  Now these thoughts never happened when I'm with my friends but every time I'm not is when they showed up. Now days, because of the recent pandemic, I haven't been able to be around my friends and could really only talk over discord, but now I constantly have these thoughts of a being a burden, that they would be happier for without me and I started having suicidal thoughts again even though I'm not going to act on them as I don't want to die, and I have reason too feel this way as my friends have been very nice and a good friends, I even plan on asking a girl out soon, so why do I feel this way even though I have no reason too."
1347,Mens mental health,So my partner has been struggling with his mental health and im trying to do anything i can to support him. He has low self worth and is frustrated with almost everything. What are some genuine nice things i can do or get him to show him how amazing he is and how much I care? How can I better support him?
1348,Why can’t I let shit go?!,"So, I really struggle letting things go. I think a better word for it is rumination. I ruminate. A lot. An example of this was the time I obsessively thought about an uncomfortable exchange with a classmate when I was in high school. He and two of his female friends cornered me about something I did to annoy this kid. Yes, it was not my best moment. I purposely made a mess for him to clean up because he was doing bitch work for the teacher to get a passing grade. The guy was a dick and just wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine. It backfired, big time. For the next 9 months I RUMINATED on this. Every spare moment to myself, in the shower, on the walk to school, on the wall back home, while I put on my lanyard for work, ect ect. It haunted me. I eventually got it out of my system but it took a LONG time, clearly. My parents were a big source of my unhealthy mental state. I moved out when I was 18 and since then things got better.

Over the years, (30s now), I have tried to get over my ruminating qualities and succeeded, for the most part. Covid and the social unrest has me ruminating again and I am struggling. I ruminated HARD today about where my neighbor parked her car claiming it was too close to my driveway. I mean, I’m not wrong, her car is close. But it’s also not worth the 6 hours I’ve spent thinking about it. Any advice for a slightly neurotic human that needs to stop thinking about dumb shit?"

1350,Seeing stuff that no one else does,"So I’ve experienced seeing stuff that other people don’t, quite a lot but I don’t know if this is the same as that. 

My boyfriend was sleeping but I started to think he was just ignoring me so I went and checked if he was active on the Xbox and it came up saying he was active and playing a game with his friends. About 10/15 minutes later I checked again to take a photo of it for proof and it said he was active 5 hours ago. Now I’m starting to dissociate and feel like none of it happened which is kinda normal for me but I’m really confused because I’ve never heard of people seeing stuff happen through screens."
1351,Life's kicking me in the teeth right now so I'm just going to vent here.,"Just really having a hard time about it right now. I'm a Uni student and can't get back home easily so haven't seen my family properly in almost a year. When covid happened everyone I knew left as well so I haven't had much contact with anyone besides customers at work and we all know what they're like! My studies have suffered badly and I just wish I'd reached out about that sooner

The one thing I was looking forward to was leaving for home in July. However turns out the estate agent screwed up with the break clause on my house (there was a typo in my contract) and I can't leave until septmeber. I'm about to get dragged into a massive legal battle over it. Then I have a placement even further away that starts in September so I might not see my family for another year on top. Honestly I'm really feeling done with my degree and the situation in general. I feel hollow, emotionless. I lost the ability to do what I love (cycling) because of uni and now with my mental state I can't really bring myself to pull myself out of the hole. I can't study, I can't do the things I enjoy without feeling guilty about not studying

Sorry if this is a ramble I'm just writing things down as they come to my head"
1352,There's definitely *something* wrong,"I have been in a bad mental spot for a month now. I knew I was feeling bad, but I just thought it was just me having a bad time, until I sort of went off on a friend just on a ""I don't care about anything any more"" and she responded with saying she knows where I am because she's been there too, and she was sorry I was dealing with depression. Even though I know all of the symptoms of mental health problems, but it just hadn't clicked.

In the past month I've had panic attacks almost everyday, I've had the worst and strangest sleep situation of my life, constantly tired, but something feels weird when I try to sleep, I've been constantly anxious, everything is a trigger, I've been running away every time it does though.  In the past 3 days I have barely been eating.  For the firs time I legitimately have not seen the point in doing anything.  That's just the month it's been bad, in the past I've had lots of intrusive thoughts, more sleep disturbances, more spaced out panic attacks but at greater intensity, and assorted mental breakdowns from suppressed memories.  Oh and I guess also importantly anxiety, depression, and a handful of other things run in my family.

I think I might have PTSD, I looked at the DSM, and especially after this month.  Or if not that there's something else. I know it sounds weird but I don't know how to tell my therapist or if I should. There are a few reasons for this: I don't want to come off as someone who web-md's themselves which in a way I sort of am, but it would probably come off more like that because there are quite a few of the bigger issues I haven't brought up, I don't know how to bring it up. Yeah I'll stop there; I have no idea how I would go about bringing that up because we've been working through some stuff, so it's not like a blank slate. And I don't know how to bring it up with my mom, because when I've brought up stuff in the past she's sort of brushed off the idea that I have anything diagnostically wrong. (Or at least her opinion on that has varied *greatly*). Plus she's always given off a large ""We can only have one child with mental health problems in the household."" So yeah I don't know what to do. I don't want to make people worry because I am safe. I just don't know what to do."

1356,"I relieve my mother's death 12 times per day, every day, today is a bad one and thought I'd share","Possibly relevant background, I've been diagnosed Bi Polar (2), yay, since my twenties. A good medication took care of any major issues and I was able to perform at high degrees in work, life, etc.

6-years-ago, mother passed away. 

Our relationship was a long and complicated story but we were as close as a son and mother could be. She was an epic person, a brilliant woman who gave love to everyone around her. A powerful woman who could literally move mountains when she wanted.

I was there when she died. I was there when she was admitted 22 days earlier for what looked like cervical cancer. I spent every day there, yelling at doctors, having conversations I didn't understand, really struggling with not becoming unhinged. Mostly confused about a cancer travelling through her killing her incredibly quickly.

When we got to the time that her body was failing, as I mentioned, I was there. The medication to control her breathing wasn't working so she was gasping for air, she had an incredible fever, she was sweating, twisting and griping in pain and fear. 

I remember her looking at me, I know the rational here is that she was so high on a massive dose  of pain meds that she had no idea what she was looking at but I swear... She looked right at me, she was in so much pain, a pain that burned through her body, something no human, not her, should ever experience.

Somewhere in between screams, blood, green fluids, piss and gurgling, her body finally gave in. And she was gone.

I broke. I just broke.

Before all of this I'd proudly tell you I was the youngest VP in a top company in my industry and I was changing the world working 70 hours of week. High 6 figure income, my wife could do whatever she wanted, 2 amazing kids.

My frantic, Bi-Polar brain had locked onto the image of my mother dying, PTSD filled in the blanks with smells and emotions and my life went from being a wealthy king in waiting to being a drooling mess on my expensive sofa.

In 6 years I've been on am incredible number or medications, so many excersize routines I can't differentiate the burpees from the liftoffs. I've seen no less than 5 shrinks, some from the insurance company, some from actual Doctor recommendations. Some were good, some just wanted my hourly billing.

Today: been a pretty good day, spent good time working on the house with my beautiful wife. She kissed me a few times and I like that. Then, around 7, it hit me like a monster.

Flashes of death, blood, screaming, her struggling to breath. The hospital smell is so thick in my nose it's all I can smell.

6 years on, this has Happened almost every day. Sometimes just small reminders but other times like this. The HIFI version, complete with screams of pain.

I break down, run downstairs so my wife and kids don't see me lose it. Drop 2 Ativan because I can't breath now. Crying uncontrollable because I just want to save her, you know? Like, I get it was 6 ago, she's gone, but fuck man, she doesn't deserve this pain...

I have to stop it. But I can't.

3 hours I basically bawled hysterically, my wife Finally caught on and came to hold me. It made me feels worse be better to have there. She loved my mom as well so I get she feels the same a little bit.

I don't know if anyone is reading this but if you are, here's what I want. I just want to miss my mom dude. Like I want to miss her and think of her in pain like this, to feel responsible like this.

I feel without hope, without end. It has been 6 long years of unimaginable despair with continuous reminders of why.

Not to the dramatic but I find it difficult to imagine having much right left in me. I'm so tired. So overwhelmed."
1357,I hate my brain. I hate it so much.,"I hate it. I hate OCD. I hate depression. I hate how my older sister spits on me and purposefully triggers me. I hate how she responded with “haha mood” after I told her about my self harm. I hate how she said that “ADD is very similar to OCD so I go through everything and more than you do.” I hate how my brain can never shut off. I hate how I can’t go one night without sleep paralysis or terrifying nightmares. I hate myself. I hate the stigma surrounding OCD and how very few people truly understand what I go through every single day.

1358,Night time panic attacks - then I don’t remember in the morning,"So for my entire life (I’m 29 now) I have been a sleep talker. Occasionally a sleep walker but only a handful of times in my life. Over the years it’s gotten worse, and now my wife is getting scared. I’m getting aggressive in my sleep, waking up in panics sometimes grabbing my wife and I don’t remember any of it the next morning. Sometimes she says my words are just gibberish and other times it’s clear and understandable.  Last night she said I was telling someone to put their hands up and get on the ground. I was an MP in the army reserves and spent about a year and a half on active duty outside of training but no combat experience so it’s not PTSD. 

Biggest problem is it’s affecting her sleep now with how bad it’s gotten and with her being a full time nurse and a full time student working on her masters, I don’t want to be the cause of more stress for her. Would CBD help at night? I just don’t even know where to start or what kind of doctor to see for this. I also work in pharmaceuticals so weed is out of the question as a treatment unfortunately. Thanks for the help everyone."
1359,The philosophical persuit of pessimism and It's relationship to modern mental health.,"I think a lot about the diagnoses I received as a young man (majordepression, generalized anxiety), and in a way I can notice myself being different from those around me. In an attempt to find solace in the universe I stumbled upon the philosophy of pessimism mostly represented in my life by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Sartre, and Cioran.

Each philosopher contends that it is almost inevitable for an existential being to come to the conclusion of the lack of inherent value and purpose of existence. This tension between a need for meaning and the reality of human discourse can cause one to contemplate suicide. To their credit I would say that each philospher lived until their naturally occuring death, and overcame the natural inclination towards suicide by creating great works of ontological art. 

How do we distinguish between the reality of human discourse, and the peigns of mental illness? Where do we draw the line between the crushing realization of inherent meaninglessness of existence, and chronic mental illness? What is the process of diagnoses for patients that adopt these philosophies and what may seperate them from someone who is experiencing the same feelings but doesnt have an education in philosophy and critical thinking?"

I’m still functioning, but I don’t feel anything. I can’t keep a single thought going and I feel like I’m about to cry, but everytime I start I just freeze and start panicking.

For whatever it’s worth, i suffer from borderline personality disorder and wouldn’t be surprised if he did too. We’ve been dating for 10 months. We frequently get in arguments that quickly get volatile. Things like “I hate you” and lots of door slamming. Things have gotten violent and Cops have shown up but I won’t get into that now. Tonight after I had a breakdown (because I feel incredibly trapped with him here in this new state and apartment) I finally was able to go into the next room and cool down. He got on his phone and - because he pays the internet bill - took his phone and knocked me off of the WiFi so I couldn’t watch Netflix. Then, after going to confront him about it, he literally laughed hysterically because of how angry I was."

I personally believe in the credibility and logic behind the philosophy of pessimism as described by the above mentioned philosophers. I would love to hear anyones thoughts on the matter. Especially that of a professional that understands the modern state of psychology.

""Only those are happy who never think or, rather, who only think about life's bare necessities, and to think about such things means not to think at all. True thinking resembles a demon who muddies the spring of life or a sickness which corrupts its roots. To think all the time, to raise questions, to doubt your own destiny, to feel the weariness of living, to be worn out to the point of exhaustion by thoughts and life, to leave behind you, as symbols of your life's drama, a trail of smoke and blood - all this means you are so unhappy that reflection and thinking appear as a curse causing a violent revulsion in you.""

I used to be Spongebob, now I am a Squidward suffering whilst against society.

I had a tyrade non-verbally since

1. My Dad is sound asleep.

2. I'd be a complete idiot saying it.

But it went something like this, picture me and some other classmates with the teacher while we were doing something called ""morning meetings"" on the rug.

 "" Jimmy, how was your day? Great! Floyd, (my privacy name) how was your day? Me about to go on a tyrade: Depressing. And why is that Floyd? Field Day.

Teacher: What happened?

Me: (tyrade time) Being kicked and punched in the eye, I can't believe that people call me ""dramatic"" FOR BEING FUCKING PUNCHED AND KICKED IN THE EYE!??! That makes no sense at all, considering the fact you people saw it out in the blue, and god damn my sunglasses are the hero, but you guys thought I was being dramatic for being punched and kicked in the eye, and you guys said to me ""oh you're a dramatic, don't be angry and sad, you just want attention"" Bitch, what I did to you, nothing, and considering the fact that everyone (including me, I was dramatic once) and you lash out on me? Obviously the is some really fucking bias here. You don't think you're dramatic once, that's some bullshit right there. And even my parents said to brush it off when in actuality, that put bricks in my wall, so does the people.who told me that I am doing it for attention, can go fuck off to Disneyland, and it wasn't bad enough, my friends said I was dramatic, and do you know how many friends told me that? Almost everyone! I can just rename *my ""friends"" * to assholes. They have betrayed me, and worse enough, borderline depression, mental insanity, emotional numbness, and maybe even bipolar. And if you ever see me, don't talk to me, EVER, you assholes. *proceeds to walk out of school*

Now, that was kind of crazy, to say the least.

Welp, at least I got that off my chest for about a year."
1366,Truly am I worthy of being loved?,"I’ve driven most people away, wether they were frustrated or scared or just dealing with their own problems and couldn’t help me. It just seems like no matter how hard I try, I will never be worth anyone’s time. The people I talk with these days would have every right to leave me behind. I’m a burden. I’m not a worthy person, I’m just garbage. Part of me wishes I was DOA, that way I wouldn’t have impacted anyone’s lives and the albatross around their necks that is me would have never been a problem in the first place."
1367,What sort of issues does being told as a child that your parents wished they never had you would create?,"If you had a mother who said “I should’ve never had kids” screamed with deep rage “I hate you, you ruined my life” “kids are the worst thing to ever happen to me” and just General “rage” attacks involving screaming, berating, crying, throwing things and just sort of berating you that no matter what you say there’s no winning. But then also the mother was very loving and kid at times and then eventually the mother and adult child had a wonderful relationship. 

I’m asking what sort of self esteem issues or social issues or relationship issues this might create for the child? (Not about how it effects the daughter - mother relationship specifically)

Idk why I worded it 3rd person lol, but obv it’s about me. I feel a lot of pain about my childhood experiences and wonder if this sort of thing can lead to long term damage mentally."
1368,"I’ve only ever smoked socially but now I’m having an overwhelming urge to smoke, can you help me understand why?","I’m 25f, it’s 1:50 AM right now and I have an overwhelming urge to smoke a cigarette.

I’m not really a smoker, but my best friend is. I occasionally join her by smoking one cigarette. This happens at most 5-6 times a year, and last time I did that was probably in January of this year.

I won’t lie, I like it, mostly because of how it tastes at the back of my throat and the way it reminds me of my late dad who smoked a lot. My friend and I seem to do this “tradition” with really deep late night talks and whenever shit really hits the fan.

But I don’t have a real smoking habit, I don’t go out of my way to buy a cigarette, I don’t intend to pick it up either for health reasons and (until right now) I didn’t have any dependence on it. With all that said, what’s going on? Why am I suddenly craving it? Could I really be addicted after all this time?"
1369,What could this be about?,"So ever since i was a child, i was a perfectionist, especially when it came to my creativity. The first ones i could remember is me making birthday cards for my family members and constantly redoing them, wasting paper cause i thought it was ugly. If i decorate my room, it will be a week and i think its ugly so i redo it... now i think its uglier so i redo it again. This process repeats until i just give up cause ive made a mess now. Its almost always to do with my art but its sometimes things i buy or basically any desicion i make myself.

I have adhd, do you think this is the cause?

If you have another diagnosis and the same experiences as me, what is it?"
1370,Avalanche of Issues,"You know how it goes. A person comes to talk about something, gets a response or doesn’t, but either way they’re talking into the void. I’m here because I have no where else to go. A void is better company than myself. 

**tw: grooming, mentions of pedophilia, unhealthy family dynamics, chronic illness**

I’m 18, and I feel like my life ended before it began. Still, gotta count my blessings. I don’t have anything terminal. I’m white, male, and my parents aren’t complete shit. But holy fuck, man. I’ve got issues. I feel like either I've got too many, or maybe I'm just making some of them up. 

I don’t feel safe to talk about all of them. Basically, I’m a part of the LGBT+ community, and my mom... she didn’t yell at me, she didn’t send me to a conversion camp, she didn’t kick me out. She eventually allowed me to begin expressing myself in moderate ways. I’m grateful for that. But that doesn’t mean she took it well. She said some things that I can't forget, and I don't have the courage to repeat at the moment. Who says that stuff to their 15 year old kid. Who... christ, who says that stuff at all. 

I’ve got chronic, escalating health issues that prevented me from finishing high school. Couldn’t get my GED because of covid. Doctors are clueless. I feel like a deadbeat, lazy, disappointing son. All I do is lay on the couch all day, and whenever I try to do more, like laundry or dishes, recovery takes hours. I’m not exactly unfit, I’m just really sick. Can’t even call my friends for too long, or I’ll get worn out. I want to adopt a rescue dog, but my dad made a good point- If I can’t even muster the energy to study for 90 minutes a day, how do I expect to care for a life? 

My health issues made the past few years hazy, and I have the life experience of... honestly, can’t tell. My estimate is a 14 or 15 year old (*not* saying I’m going to get romantically involved with people of that age, that’s nasty). What I can remember isn’t great. Toxic friendships, groomed at the age of 16/17, self-image issues, learning that the older cousin I was close with as a kid is a pedo (I don’t remember time we spent alone, but I remember being groomed for certain things), two years at home 24/7, and just. A lot of pain. A lot of sickness. A lot of family drama. 

I’m sorry, this is too long already. I don’t know why I came here tonight. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice, validation, or just to sit down and have a chat with the void. I don’t know, but I know I'm whining. I'm sorry. I’m tired."
1371,"Feeling alone, needed to vent","This is my first post on reddit, and my only current active ""social media"" account. I used to have Facebook and be a part of large gaming communities and such, but as the hardware evolved, so did our friendships, but I digress. 

Ive eaten 3.5 grams of shrooms, and I'm brewing up my second cup of mushroom tea for a total of about 7 grams. I've smoked more raw cones then I care to count at this point, to the point I'm smoking them because I just legitimately like to smoke. 

I'm 35, turning 36 this month. I've been married for 13 years, and we've been together for 15 years total. We've had our shares of ups and downs over the years, and were quickly seen as ""the ideal couple"" for our small group of high school alumni, and soon we found ourselves the only marriage remaining. 

We've brought 3 children into this world, with a total of 5 pregnancies. After the 5tj we finally had 2 girls and a boy, so my wife had the surgery, as it was quicker/cheaper for us. 

Fast forward today, and our oldest is 13, but I lost her the day she started kindergarten. She's basically lied, stolen, and did everything she possibly could to do the opposite of what I say/ask her to do. She's 13 so obviously she's already had the birds and bees talk, and is aware of her monthly stuff. I grew up with 3 sisters and no brothers so I know more about that stuff then my wife does, so I'm used to all that's stuff. 

What I'm not used to is a child being so lazy about her own hygiene that she will leave a bloody feminine product in her dresser drawer, because she didn't feel like walking to the bathroom, 15 steps from her room. We also have 2 bathrooms so availability usually isn't the problem. 

So we bought her a garbage can for her bedroom. At least if she wouldn't leave it, maybe we could keep it from her drawers, but nope no change. 

Also she has basically stolen every piece of money left laying around the house, even from the other 2. She will grab food from the cupboard and hide the wrappers in her room, or down behind the stove.or washer and dryer. I've found banana peels and stuff rotting if I don't check it daily. 

My middle child is 11 and has type 1 diabetes. She was diagnosed at 5, so she's basically known diabetes more than she has a normal life. She's very small so in no way has a diet to follow, she just needs to make sure she gets the correct amount of insulin. She is still injection dependent because truthfully, even with government help I can't afford it. My benefits cover this so we need to get used to it.

Back to her being small. She is using a Humalog injection pen, but it's so big she can't hold it, squeeze an injection point, and press the trigger all at once if she uses her arms, so if course her stomach has become all bruised and slightly distended because of the constant use of the same spots. The doctors, ( yes plural) have told her repeatedly not to use the same spots, and to move farther from her belly button, but she is not able to do any other area herself because it hurts. Which is understandable, and we can't be available for every injection, she's 11 and if covid ever becomes less of a problem she will probably like to go out of the house again sometime. 

My 3rd child is 6, but some days I feel like I'm talking to him at 2 years old again. He's become one of those children you see in TV who throws a tantrum because I told them no more tv. Literally he has screamed loud enough to wake the neighbors dog, and has lost his voice to it. 

He doesnt seem to retain any sense of hygiene, and no matter how we explain or offer things up to him, he basically lives in his own filth 24/7.  

We put a TV in his room at a young age because the noise helped him sleep. He was always ""finicky"". Once you found a brand for him to eat or drink, you couldn't change it or he'd refuse to eat or drink any substitute for days. I've taken him to the hospital over his refusal to drink anything other then juice. He stopped drinking any form of milk before he was 2 because of a carton of bad almond milk from Costco. One drink and he now vomits any time he drinks anything dairy or dairy substitute. Just to keep him hydrated we had to give him juice so diluted it could no longer be called juice. And again as above, hospital for dehydration, so he won that one 

School and day care were good for him. He has way to much energy. And probably falls under multiple spectrums for several charts if I wanted to actively pursue it, which I don't have the energy for it now. 

Sorry for the long rant so far, and thanks if you've made it this far. I wish it was stopped there and a nice easy way out, but follow along and see just another step in my life. If you believe in karma, please let me know how big of a mistake I made in the past to add up to all of this. 

I've been dealing with stomach issues since my early teens, and a condition called hyper hydrosis. For the lazy, basically my body does not shut off my sweat glands. I can be sitting on the couch in a pair of shorts at room temp, or at 10 below, and I'll still be sweating from everywhere. Tried one surgery, ended up with seared sweat ducts, a nasty case of infection because of a need to use deodorant to return to work early or face termination 

I've been stuck in call centers since I was 19 because of health, availability, financial dependancy, etc. We've all heard the same excuses a million times over so insert whichever you need to keep reading. 

I've had surgery for my hyper hydrosis, and had surgery for a herniated disc in the l5-s1 area that pushed against my sciatic nerve for about 10 years. I've had carpal tunnel surgery on one hand but have not had time to have the other done. 

Now I'm dealing with daily nausea, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhea/ constipation. I've had both constipation and diarrhea in one sitting at the toilet, it's weird. 

I've been waiting a year and a half for a gastro because my town of about 100k doesn't attract top quality or quantity so we only have a few to choose from. 

On top of this I've also been diagnosed with maniac depression, with possible bipolar symptoms. My gp has sent a referral to a psychiatrist but they had a 6 month wait list before covid.  I've been out on medical leave since Feb of this year, with no end in site. 

My wife decided to go back to college last year to get out of the fast food jobs she's used to. She got govt funding, plus student loans, and we had some $ saved so great. In the early fall she started getting sick, and was having dizzy spells. 

By October she'd been to the er twice because it wouldnt go away. She was basically having vertigo meets the spins from when you're drunk. Vomiting and everything that goes with both of course. 

 She's seen a gp, an ent, a neurologist, and a cardiologist. Not a single test, prescription, exercise, nothing helps. So now she is bed ridden. Getting out of bed feels like everything is spinning so badly that she can't focus on anything more then 2 feet away. 

We finally managed to get get pulse down to a normal level. At rest it was averaging around 130-140 a day. And no doctor saw anything wrong 

I'm going to wrap up soon i promise,  but again, mushrooms and weed. Sorry. I hope to God in my noobness I didnt hit a character cap somewhere :/


So now I'm essentially a caregiver at 35. I have to run the whole house, with 3 kids who don't care about their own hygiene, and are very definitely ""it's not my problem/mess"" thinkers. 

I have a wife who for all intents is disabled, but can't even get a diagnosis to get labeled a such. We haven't been able to be intimate in months. Picture sex on a water bed, on a cruise ship. That's what her head feels like, so I feel bad even talking about it. I find myself having to disconnect to be able to perform the basic tasks to help her IE getting in and out of the bathtub, getting dressed, etc. 

I'm also dealing with daily pain etc as stated above. Celiac has been ruled out by blood tests. Fodmap diet reduces frequency if bowel movements but does nothing for the pain. Gluten free did nothing. I went for back surgery in March of 2019 and weighed 252lbs. Within 6 months I was down to 210lbs without trying or maintaining any sort of diet regiment. And in truth I eat like trash. Too much take out, too many quick meals. 

I'm sorry for the rant, im exhausted mentally and physically. Im alone physically only, because there is always a voice reminding me of how bad I failed something. 

I get no help at home, Im waiting months for professional help, and being a country boy I'm trying to find a reason to not just grab my camping equipment, my dog, and just drive into the woods and disappear. 

I'm not a Saint by any means, and have probably earned, or caused 90% of my own problems but I needed to talk. Even if it's to myself."
1372,A seeping volcano on course for a violent eruption.,"For the past 8 months it has been me and my young daughter, every day, no break, constant contact. When I go to the bathroom? There she is. Lock the door? Banging and screaming until I come out. Go to sleep? Shes up every 1 to 2 hours with night terrors. Sleep in bed with my husband? He whines about being woken up when I go to comfort our daughter. Ask husband to tend to her so I can sleep? He ignores her and she gets up and stays up and will only talk or interact with me. 

My daughter is a year away from school age. However, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from August to November she and I attended preschool. I was 1 of 4 ""room parents"" who stayed and helped out. This was fine. The school was 20 minutes away with no transportation besides car. Well, November my cars registration was up and it needed $1100 worth of work done to pass inspection. I spoke to the mechanic who agreed to a 6 month payment plan then my husband shot it down saying he could do the work himself for $500. So, he took my car out of the shop and drove it to his Dad's 4 car garage and parked it. December came and went, no repairs. January? 1 repair, replaced the wiper blades. February? No repairs. March? No repairs. April? 1 repair, replaced a burnt out headlight bulb. May? No repairs. June? So far, no repairs. 

I do not nag him as he goes nuclear when any criticism is given. I asked him in April if he was starting the vehicle whenever he went out to his Dad's for a weekly visit and poker game, he said ""No, that battery is dead."" I asked if he could replace the battery and start it to keep it somewhat active and he yelled about my ""constant nagging"". I have asked him about my car maybe 3 times in 8 months. 
We have 2 cars. Mine and his. We have put out money for his car this year, new tires, tie rods, new sound system, windshield, pcv valve, catalytic converter. I am so angry and everytime I try to express myself about how frustrated I am, trapped at home 24 hours/6 days a week, no alone time, with absolutely no breaks he gets angry at me and tells me I am overreacting. My mother in law is no help either as she likes to remind me that she raised 2 kids primarily alone while my father in law was travelling for work. I find this extra irritating as she talks openly about my husband and sister in law being in daycare 3 times a week since age 1 and spending the night at their grandparents or Aunts house every other weekend since age 2. I do not have that. 

On top of this, my own family has nothing to do with me. Apparently, I'm a burden due to the fact I have no ride to get togethers and have to hitch one. 3 weeks ago, I blew up at my mom who said, ""Do you really think it's worth the hassle?"" I haven't seen any of my family in 8 months and the farthest lives 40 minutes away. I see their posts on our group text about get togethers, etc and they don't bother to invite me. I spoke to my sister yesterday morning and when I started cry-laughing about being unwanted, she asks, ""Is everything okay?"" I blew up again, I pointed out how everyone took turns driving 40 minutes out to my brothers house every other day to visit him or pick him up when he was without a car. She said nothing to go along with this. In fact, she rambled about cleaning her patio and her dogs being the ""Three Amigos"" and laughed nervously then abruptly hung up. What was that? I don't know. 

Also, I have tried to adopt 2 different hobbies this year because I had none. Embroidery and painting. My husband threw out my embroidery supplies ""by accident"" and gave my painting supplies to his teenage niece. To be fair, his niece is very talented and has painted some beautiful pieces however, I am back to square one. He said my hobbies were too expensive. I spent $0 on embroidery supplies thanks to a neighbor giving away his deceased mothers hoarde and I spent $30 on painting supplies. He has 4 hobbies: Golf, poker, firearms, and hiking. We have $250 budgeted every month for his hobbies. 
My husband has never hit me, hes never been physically abusive. He is occasionally verbally abusive but he is emotionally abusive constantly. He immediately goes to yelling even over simple questions. He is a hypocrite to his nucleus.

I needed a break so, tonight under the guise of errands I went for a leisurely drive around town. Trying to relax and just be alone. I was gone for a little over an hour and he blew up my phone. ""I'm very tired, where are you?! Are you ever coming home?!"" I drove home, stopping at the park to scream into my arm before going home. 

This is where I failed horribly, stupidly, and miserably:

I walked in the door, he is packing his bag for a day out with friends on the trail tomorrow, gives me a snarky remark, and I stormed off to the kitchen. My daughter came in to ask me why I was gone ""forever"" and I yelled at her. Telling her to ""leave me the hell alone!"" and stomping off to her room to grab her pajamas and get her ready for bed. She pestered me, ""where did you go? Why don't you love me? Why did you run away?"" I yelled at her again, ""Please just shut up!"" My husband comes out of his room, ""Goodnight, princess! Sorry mommy's throwing a fit!"" I bit down so hard I seriously have a chipped tooth now. 

I am such a dumbass. Pardon my cursing. My daughter is not the reason I'm angry, why did I treat her like trash? I feel so absolutely disgusting right now. I honestly feel like any moment I am going to explode and wreak havoc and destruction. 

I am not homicidal but I am suicidal.

Anyway, thank you for reading, I hope you have an enjoyable day today and tomorrow."
1373,My Therapy Prompted Me To Start My Own Podcast to Keep Discussing My Issues and to Hopefully Help Others,[removed]
1374,I have zero self-esteem [19M],"I've struggled with low self-esteem as long as I can remember. Recently it has reached a peak (or I guess a trough). According to Merriam-Webster, self-esteem is ""a feeling of satisfaction that someone has in himself or herself and his or her own abilities."" I'd say for me, that is literally at or close to zero. 

I am single. I'm constantly craving a romantic relationship, but every time one comes my way they either aren't interested in me or leave me for someone better. I have friends, but I think they all kind of hate me. Maybe not hate me, but at least find me really irritating. I guess when I'm around them I go into this annoying mode where I try to prove that I'm cool by making bad jokes and dominating the conversation. It's not even conscious, it just happens and then I hate myself later.

 I used to have confidence in my musical abilities, but lately, I've been publishing some of my music and it hasn't been received too well. I used to be a great student, but last semester I really screwed up in my classes. I've been depressed and often suicidal for months, I feel like I'm circling the drain. 

About a month ago I decided to take charge of my body, which I'd been neglecting for a while. I researched and started using new routines for my hair and skin, which have been going great. I started working out almost every day. I look in the mirror and physically I like who I see, but mentally I feel the same. I'm totally burned out. All the things that used to make me happy now just make me feel empty. I stay in my room most days with the lights off and my blinds down, sitting in my bed with a blanket.

I am being completely honest when I say that I think I am a complete failure of a human being. I am lazy, judgemental, I have no future in my career. I am a complete disaster and a mess. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel completely dead. My body just walks from room to room, there's no person inside. Help."
1375,Can you gaslight yourself?,"So I recently got out of a LONG term relationship with this guy. In the last few months before the breakup I realized he had gaslighted me a couple times. After I pointed it out to him he got mad and, you guessed it, gaslighted me. 

So today I was driving home from work and this guy was backing out of his driveway without looking and almost hit me. I had to swerve to the other side of the street to avoid him. When i looked back he gave that typical arm/hand gesture that would indicate it was my fault. 

Obviously it wasn't my fault, but I ended up sitting in my driveway for 20 minutes wondering if it somehow was my fault. Maybe he had plenty of time to back out and I sped up without realizing it? Did I run a new stop sign I've never seen before? It got to the point where I actually considered going back to apologize. 

Could this be a lasting affect of all the gaslighting? Could I be conditioned to self gaslight now?"
1376,I think I’m addicted,"I’ve had several therapy sessions, listened to all the advice people (including my parents who I am extremely close to) gave me on countless occasions. No matter how much sense everyone makes in those moments, or how many sessions I have, I always end up hurting myself. I think I’m truly addicted to it; I feel like if I don’t, I won’t feel better. Sometimes I do it impulsively and I don’t even think before I do it. I think I’m addicted to not just to specifically harming/hurting myself but my misery in general. Is that a real thing or am I just out of my fucking mind? 😂"
1377,I’m lost,"I’m lost

I’ve been treading water a bit lately and actually thought I was making progress with myself. But all that’s gone out of window. I hate myself for being so weak. I hate my need to numb myself with drugs and alcohol. I hate this feeling and I dunno what to do I feel like I’m on a one way collision with death and I just don’t care"
1378,I have had so many waking nightmares that I'm not sure if something that happend today is real.,"So I was napping this afternoon, and woke up to a strange noise in my ear. I swear i saw the snout of a blue tongue lizard poking out from under my pillow. I jumped up, just looked at it for a sec and ran to turn on the light and then couldn't find it. I tore my appartment appart but it was nowhere to be found. Its winter, and it should he hibetnating somewhere and not be able to move so fast.

The problem is, i have nightmares constantly where i wake up and think i see or feel something, i wake up properly (usually when i turn on the light) and its gone and i can go back to sleep. Its also normal for me to wake up halfway across the room, trying to get away or find the light switch. But normally i dont have this feeling of certainty that i was awake, that I absolutely saw it. But now I'm starting to second guess myself.

I have seen the lizzard in the yard before and am not particularly scared of it, i dont want to cohabitate, but if its in the yard im happy to live and let live. Its the waking up to scales. Snakes feature predominantly in my nightmares and im terrified of them. If you have seen a blue tongue, the can absolutly look like snakes at first glance. They also hiss when afraid or pissed. So I'm guessing my sleep to nightmare ratio is going to suck tonight. 

Any advice on being able to relax and sleep? Also advice on nighmares would be welcome."
1379,I get both real bad episodes of both depression and anxiety. But I can say even though both are horrible and cause me a lot of hurt I definitely prefer feeling depressed over being anxious. Is this weird?,"I feel depressed a lot more and it honestly feels it can be unbearable but I have to say for me when I experience severe anxiety it’s so much more unbearable, I would definitely prefer the emptiness of feeling depressed all the time than the extremely intense worry that anxiety causes me. 

Is this weird, is this okay to feel. Idk I feel a little messed up that I prefer my depression over anxiety."
1380,Do I have schizophrenia?,"Hey, I’m trying to sleep, and for some reason I’m experiencing the most insane hallucinations ever. I’ve had 3 dreams in the past 10 minutes. Everything looks weird, it’s literally like from a scene in a movie. Small areas continually move in and out in my eye and I start to question what am I doing. Is this a sign of schizophrenia. And will this ruin my life?"
1381,my coping mechanisms are stressing me out ???,"first post feel free to correct if i’m doing it wrong -
i (33,F) have, for many years, used single-person games (solitaire, sudoku, etc) to help myself calm down and distract from big stressors.  it’s become such a go-to that sometimes i don’t know what else to do when i feel overwhelmed.  over the past few months it seems like this anxiety has built inside of playing the games...
i feel almost panicked playing solitaire... an incredible sense of urgency playing sudoku, or even something more simple like that gem game...
i feel very aware that i should probably just not play any of them because they have me breathing like i just ran (at all) but also they’ve been my go to for so long that i feel kind of lost not playing ??
is this normal? at this point i’d be relieved to hear that anyone’s ever found themselves even kind of the same but also i hope you’re doing better than i am :/ 
any thoughts would be greatly appreciated"
1382,i cant stop reliving embarrassing moments (advice please),i keep reliving embarrassing moments every day when my mind isn’t occupied with something else to think about. its starting to bring me down constantly. how can i let go?
1383,"Help. Weird disassociation, confusion, unknown diagnosis","I'm not sure where to start. I've been having random moments of disassociation, I feel outside myself. My body appears distorted, like I'm not really mentally inside myself. This comes and goes and lasts anywhere from a few minutes to hours. I have seen a psychiatrist, she recommended therapy. I have also seen my regular doctor and she is scheduling me a neurology appointment. I have had anxiety and depression my whole life. My mother has bipolar disorder, my aunt has schizoaffective disorder, I think it may be genetic. I have never been diagnosed with anything. The first one started last September. I was at work talking to someone when it happened. All of a sudden, mid conversation I forgot everything we just talked about, I felt like physically I was falling and at the same time like I could not move. I felt like stone, like I couldn't walk or speak. I was still aware of what I was doing and where I was, my name and my bosses names, I went out to my car on break after and I started crying, hyperventilating because I did not know what just happened. I thought I had a stroke or a seizure. I was able to drive myself to the emergency room. My hands didn't look like mine, I got checked into the ER and finally calmed down, they did bloodwork and everything was fine, they said it was probably just a panic attack.

So after that I started the buspirone. It was ok, but I am still experiencing the disassociations extremely randomly. There does not seem to be a trigger for them. They last anywhere from a few minutes for up to 5 hours. I always feel extremely tired afterwards. When they happen it is always the same sensations, I am confused and it takes longer than normal to recall basic information, I have learned to stay calm. I feel beyond numb emotionally, also like I can't move or speak. But I am able to do so with muscle memory. I look at myself in the mirror, at my hands and it's like they don't belong to me.

I also had a cat scan after that first instance and again they did not see anything abnormal.

 My wife of 9 years was diagnosed 2 years ago with POTS syndrome and is basically disabled at this point. She cannot stand up or walk unassisted and has fallen and hit her head on occasions. I work full time in addition to taking care of her. I am not sure if I need to see a neurologist, therapist, psychologist or something else at this time. I have been taking celexa the last three years and buspirone for about 8 months. I was just prescribed Rexulti medication and have only taken one dose. On Monday we lost my father in law, my wife's step father, suddenly and unexpectedly.

Please let me know your recommendations. I know it is a lot but this is in short all of the stress of my life lately. I don't know where to begin but I am seeking help and support."
1384,How to deal with anxiety?,"For a long period of time I have dealt with anxiety, I always get nervous to the point where my hands shake when having to go to social events and having to interact with new people. I have never discussed with no one this feelings as I feel they will tell me that I’m exaggerating as I usually don’t show signs of feeling uncomfortable in those situations, however inside me I always have doubts of myself and give to much importance to the opinions of other people.

So I wanted to ask, Are there any tips on how to deal with anxiety? Because I feel limited due to this and would like to feel more comfortable with myself.

Thank you and stay safe"
1385,have you ever been angry at your own art? ...I don't know what to do,"Quick backstory, I'm 23 years old, joined a digital art school in October 2018 as a 3d art student. before I was studying engineering and this art world was (and still is) a completely new thing to me.

Came from a strict family (e.g. my parents weren't happy at all of me choosing this school, but whatever)

The first year went really smoothly, learned a lot about blender and unity and technical stuff. now we are in our second year. I think because of the large amount of information, they skipped ""some things"" of more artistic stuff, like: theory of color, composition, a n a t o m y. 

Or rather, we had them but I such a short time, it was pretty meaningless. I don't know if you are supposed to learn how to sculpt a face starting from no knowledge at all in a week's time. 

And I went from being on par with my friends and other fellow students to being useless and always trying to ask for help. 

I liked this school. This new world. i really did. but now i feel like my ""list of things that makes you happy"" turned into a ""list of things that makes you angry""...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, back to the question

In the beginning, have you ever been ""angry"" at your own art? Did you ever felt like ""Oh this isn't enough"", ""Why am I unable to improve"", ""I don't even know where to start""?  


I've been in kind of a bad place in my mind in the last four months. I feel like I lost all my motivation, and sometimes when I try to start modeling something it happened that I said to myself ""Why even bother?"" -- and obviously the result wasn't pretty.

This also lead to and heavy thing in my chest. every day, for the last four month, this thing is here, right under my sternum, and it's killing me slowly.

I started avoiding others, in order not to bother them with my shit. and I was kinda surprised, but nobody actually tried to contact me, so I guess that's ok, they are better this way.  


All I hear people say is ""Oh don't you worry, is just the effect of quarantine"", but I know for a fact this all started waaay before that..."
1386,27 living with parents,"Hi everyone. I am new to this reddit, so I'm not exactly sure what qualities as a substantial post. I just turned 27, and I have bipolar disorder, OCD, which comes with extreme anxiety. I moved out almost 5 years ago with my ex girlfriend, and it didn't work out. I moved back with my parents and my 4 cats (thank God. I missed them). I've stayed here ever since, and they love having me at home (maybe not always, but usually). I feel like a complete failure not living on my own. My 21 year old brother is back home because of the pandemic, and he got really emotional the other day about how he misses living in his own place (understandably). I realised today, I can't picture living alone. I do want to have my own place, eventually when I can afford it, but I can't picture my life living without my parents and especially my cats (no i can't take them if i move out. They are bonded and i would never do that to them). I am getting my monthly ect on Monday, (finally), but I judt just want to know what others have done in this sort of situation."
1387,"Is my therapist right? TW: Excoriation, Trichotillomania","I recently decided to open up to my therapist about my body-focused repetitive behaviors and how they are worsening. I find myself constantly pulling out hair, skin picking, and deliberately but also unconciously damaging my body. I've had these problems for the majority of my life, and keep relapsing every time I make progress. 

My therapist told me that I'm doing these behaviors because I don't get enough exercise. Apparently since I have ADHD my body puts my extra energy into these behaviors??? Is this true? She said if I get enough exercise, my behaviors might go away, and I'm really desperate for a solution so it would help to know exercise makes it go away."
1388,Hormonal depression help?,I've been on medication for depression and anxiety for a while now but when my period comes it I end up having some pretty bad days. I was planning on talking to my doctor at our upcoming appointment but this was just a bad night and I wanted to see if anyone had some advice on dealing with this?
1389,I have a fear of everything being fake,"I made this account just to post here cause this has been keeping me up a lot.
I'm afraid that everything I feel is fake, and I don't mean that like I'm pretending to feel a certain way, but that I'm just confusing everything. It's a bit hard to explain but I'll give some examples.
I have a physical disability, I can still walk but if I do so for more than 10 minutes my legs cramp up, I start heavily limping and it hurts. But, theres something in my brain that is saying ""what if this is what everyone feels? What if this is normal and you're overreacting?""
Another example, I get panic attacks pretty regularly, but what if they're not panic attacks? What if I read what a panic attack was somewhere and I just assume this is what it feels like when in reality it's a normal reaction?
Like... it's like this with everything I do. Like I've gotten to the point where if my leg is asleep I'll question if this really is what it falling asleep is, or if its something completely different. I feel ridiculous just typing this out, but it's like my brain is convinced I'm this extreme hypochondriac who's just overreacting with every little thing and in reality im 100% healthy and ""sane"". 


(Kind of side note: And the thing is it's not just with physical things, but hobbies as well. I paint but I've convinced myself I'm not an artist, I can love a tv show a lot but I dont consider myself a fan... it's like everything I do or am is fake or something...)

Has anybody ever felt this way? I don't know what to call this or if it's even a real thing, am I just overreacting about that too? I'm really confused..."
1390,*trigger warning: alcohol abuse disorder.* Alcoholism and addiction is a mental illness’s from its often co-ocurring. By the age of 28 I was an alcoholic. But no one really believed me because I didn’t fit the stereotype of a “drunk”. The people,"Closest to me had the hardest time accepting it. They downplay my drinking amounts, they make assumptions about how minuscule and non-detrimental it was to my health and life all while never actually asking a fucking question. I’m not sure while not since they clearly knew nothing about what I went though. I was also really open about it so people could freely ask if they wanted. They just chose to dance around it and act like it wasn’t there.

I’ll just vent it here because why the Fuck not lol

For about 5 years I’d drink about 3/4 a fifth of whiskey every night a few hours before I’d go to bed. By myself, at least 6-7 nights a week. And then I’d go to work or school the next morning at either 6 am or 8 am. I followed a strict patterned routine so that I could keep it hidden and I could still go to work or school.

The next 3 years I was drinking a whole fifth of whiskey still each night before bed. Still 6-7 nights a week. Occasionally I’d take a few days off here and there but never longer than 3. My patterned routine was working for me as I was able to get through undergrad and grad school with almost all As.
I drank mainly as a coping mechanism to relieve anxiety, depression symptoms, traumatic memories I was ignoring. But I did finally acknowledge I had a problem in the 6 year and I wanted to stop. I felt before that i had a problem but I wasn’t ready to admit that at all unfortunately. But after I decided, I tried more than a few times to get sober (on my own) and the longest I lasted was 2 weeks.

The last year I was at my lowest, I felt so stuck in the cycle of addiction and I had no idea how to get myself out, and I clearly wanted out so badly by then. My ex-husband comes from a big drinking family so he enabled me our whole relationship and was even codependent. However, it’s not his fault, and I would never blame someone else for my addiction. I made 2 suicide attempts that year and finally admitted myself to inpatient.

Ugh it didn’t end there though. Removing the alcohol was just removing the bandaid I used to cover a gaping festering wound. My issues were within myself, with myself, and my mental health.

So slip ups do happen and I relapsed after 11 months. I Fell into old habits slowly but surely over a period of 6 months. Until I was back doing that suicidal-addiction dance again. Yeah, it’s a problem when you drink half a whiskey, fall asleep, then wake up at 3 am and drink half a vodka. When your husband hides the liquor at 5 am you decide to chug carpet cleaner instead, because that will sure show him! Wait What?. Within minutes my legs were numb, my arms were numb, I’m drooling and can’t speak. Hubby drags my ass into the tub, smashing my eye on the towel bar to get me to throw up what I can. Not the best idea because it burned again on the way back up but possibly helped me. Idk what happens when you drink carpet cleaner? Besides becoming stupider lol.

But I have been sober since but I’m more successful this time around because of therapy, continuously addressing my problem behaviors and working on fixing them. And also a proper diagnoses from a different doctor.

But the bottle doesn’t discriminate. It doesn’t give a shit about your race, your sex, your education, your socioeconomic status. It preys on anyone who might be vulnerable from a mental illness or tragic life event. But it can also completely blindside a healthy individual. It can be your neighbor, your teacher, your sister, a person who seems like they always have their life together. It hasn’t been the stereotypical middle aged father and husband for years. 

If you can drink socially and control it, more power to you. I don’t bash people who drink, it’s engrained in our society and sometimes it is expected when you’re young.


Everything I said about alcohol can be said about addiction to other drugs. It’s all the same slippery slope that feels like hell."
1391,"Positive Mindset, How to Achieve it?","For the past years, I used to have a positive mindset as to why everything is how they are, I would question them and try to make sense out of it from different point of views that end up on a positive note. Except for my ""family"".

But lately, I'm not able to do so to the point where I wonder as to how was I able to think positively of others. It's the worst with my ""family"". I wonder if living alone on campus alone made coming back to my family's house made it worst since I got some privacy and a space of my own there.

How do you guys keep a positive mindset instead of taking everything in negatively?"
1392,*trigger warning* was I sexually abused by my classmate as a child? Mental health on the decline,"I want to try and understand if this is normal. I'm in two minds about the whole experience but deep down I feel frustrated and ashamed.
When I was 4/5 y/o a girl classmate said I could be her friend if I played a secret game with her. From what I remember it involved her holding my clit &amp; rubbing it while she counted to 100 and then I'd have to do the same to her. I had no idea what we were doing but it was fun and felt good. I ended up cuming multiple times and then I started to do the same thing to myself in bed at night.
I realised what was happening a few years later after reading the sexual health section in a magazine (I was masterbating) but immediately felt weird and ashamed about how it all started. I found out this had happened to other girls in my class too. 
I transfered to a secondary school far away from any of my primary classmates bc of this situation. 
Ive never told anyone but harbour some seriously weird guilt surrounding the whole thing. I'm now mid 20s and still use the same technique to get myself off but feel really weird about it. I have massive self esteem issues, self hatred, social anxiety &amp; more. Im also afraid of making friends with females, kind of like an inferiority complex or just generally fearful idk. 
If anyone can help me make sense of this, please leave a comment. Tysm x"
1393,Movies about mental health.,"What good movies do you know about mental health?   
I think they have an important role to play in society because they open up people's mind towards issues often unknown to the general public.  
Any recommendation welcome!"
1394,Does forcing someone with social anxiety to face their fears help?,"i love my friends, but they keep trying to force me to meet new people, but i really don’t think that will help me rn. they think i need to put myself out there, but i am trying new things. this month i have started to force myself to call family members, since i could only text them, and calling people very much triggers my anxiety. 

i really just don’t feel like it will help rn, and will only cause me more worry. i tried to meet and talk to two people i didn’t know that they introduced, and it didn’t go over well. i know me bringing it up and bailing because they want to invite other friends to group hangouts really angers them, and honestly that also makes me anxious."
1395,I don’t think I’m suicidal but sometimes I wish for a painful death. + I have murder dreams,"I don’t know why but sometimes I wish for the most excruciating painful death possible. I want to feel all the pain I’ve put onto others and multiply it into myself infinitely. I’m 17 and I’ve dealt with depression and hallucinations most of my life up until relatively recently. All my life I’ve dealt with dreams of me killing people. It could be anyone from my friends to my family entire schools of 800+ people. I killed someone’s entire family as he slept and then rather than killing him I stuck my knife into his spine so he could never walk again and never play the sports he loved. If you’d like to know why it was because the day previous he gave me back the wrong pair of earbuds. It wasn’t his fault it was an honest mistake and in my dream I massacred his family and didn’t even give him an easy way out. I let him suffer... for a pair of earbuds! I hate myself! I hate that I can’t be friends with anyone without having to watch them die to my hands. I just want to live normally not having to watch them all die. There’s probably one exception to this rule and that ofc is the girl I like. She’s the only one in the world that I would probably never be able to kill irl and I don’t remember a time where I’ve killed her in my dreams either. I’ve gunned down my friend who was begging for his life right in front of me and I felt nothing. I didn’t feel anything in the dream and I didn’t feel anything after. I’ve had a dexter type dream before btw where I’ve killed 70+ people some of which were my closest family members before being killed by dexter himself and when he was cutting into my face I just layer there motionless feeling every bit of pain but not feeling anything and I stained, stained into his eyes as he sliced forcefully into my face. I had some dreams where I didn’t actually kill the people too. There was this one where I was at a friends house and I fell asleep to see his sister groping herself behind him and I told myself stop I can’t think this and suddenly there was red everywhere and everyone in his house was dead with their hearts carved out and their throats ripped as if birds had desired to eat first their vocal cords and then their chests clean through. I laid there with my chest and throat chewed through and a giant vulture 5 feet tall and 2 and a half feet in diameter at its thickest point standing over me twitching it’s head back and forth watching my movements of which there were none. Oh and I guess this also counts for not killing someone in my dreams but theres still death involved, the girl I like, I’ve had dreams where she’s on her deathbed and I watch as she finally dies and she’s gone forever. This actually gets to me both in the dream and out but it’s the only death I really have that makes me feel sad. I’ve had other times where I just feel freaked out surprised scared stressed and sometimes even happy for what I’ve done in the dream but besides the ones where I watch her die I’ve never once felt sad. If anyone here is worried I haven’t actually killed anyone and I’ve not seen anyone die except through videos which btw I did not look up I was just shown them and watched and laughed in the past. I see some sometimes now but more than anything I just feel disappointed that I have to see that kind of thing anymore it’s boring it’s not cool it’s gross it’s not really my kind of thing anymore. I don’t really abuse animals btw I spank them but lightly whenever they do something bad or splash water on them but I’ve never attacked my pets or any other animals but I’ve been around plenty of dead animals and even asked to be the one to put down my dog when it was time. I don’t think I’ll ever really kill someone unless they attack me or my family though but I certainly would be able to kill them if the time came. Oh and btw my hallucinations were internal auditory and they only ever told me things like that I sucked not anything like kill yourself or kill someone else and they’re nonexistent anyway now so it doesn’t really matter. The reason I probably have the thoughts and longing for a painful death is from my Cush too btw and not because she said anything like I hope you die it’s just really me thinking it would be easier if I never had feelings for her than it would if i did. I kind of used this as a way to rent without a counselor or someone else I could tell this to but I really didn’t mean to clickbait with the whole idea of I want a painful death, my crush is just the only reason I can think of although that doesn’t explain why I think I deserve punishment for things I never actually did but whatever. I didn’t expect to write all this down so I didn’t really write it with comprehension in mind and I’m too lazy to fix it so sorry good night maybe I’ll feel different in the morning."
1396,Is it normal to not be motivated to get up and eat?,"I’ve been noticing that in the morning or throughout the day I’ve been too tired or just not motivated to go and make myself breakfast or food no matter how hungry I am. Sometimes I’m embarrassed to go and make myself breakfast, because I wake up at 11am and get out of bed at 12pm.
Sometimes I don’t even notice that I’m hungry.
Is there a way to help myself with this? And also why is this happening?"
1397,I just want to experience emotions,"I feel nothing. Literally nothing. I don't feel love to my friends, I don't love my girlfriend anymore and I want to ruin every bond that I have with somebody. When my mom was in danger,i was supposed to be nervous and sorry for her but I felt nothing. It's like all my emotions have been cut off. I don't feel thrilled anymore. I pretend to love my girlfriend, because i don't want to hurt her. It takes a lot not to say that I don't care about her. Nothing is interesting anymore. My job became boring, no art ideas. I became extra clumsy. Everyday chores suddenly became so difficult. And I feel like i'm in a bubble and this void inside of me is growing. Everything is meaningless, because in the end, there's always an end. I just want this feeling to stop because it ruins all my friendships and affects my life."
1398,Infidelity 9 years later,"The backstory: 04/02/2011 my wife meet up with a friend of mine at the park and had sex with him in the park restroom while I was at work. When I got home the guilt of her act eat at her so much I could tell something was wrong she refused to speak to me, look at me talk to me. The next morning she left with our 4 year old with no explanation (at this time I had no idea she had cheated). Over the next few days I learned the truth and tried to talk to her, I cried and begged her to just come home but faced the coldest person I've ever meet, when saying I love you I got I know, when asking how kid was I get he's ok I guess. After a week I got word the guy had moved in with his brother in the same town my wife had moved to with her mom and I received devorce papers with a restraining order. Talking to a lawyer made things worse for me he tells me I need to prove a new relationship and show poor judgement on her part for being with a guy who had several drug charges in the past. So I hacked her email, her messager big mistake. She talked to her friends I'm dirt I'm center of convo in every instance and biggest mistake she made was waiting 5 years to leave. I attempted suicide about this time bye taking alot of pills but woke up sick as a dog but still alive. I continued monitoring her messages until one day I seen one of her friends tell her she seen me and I looked like I was close to death, I had lost weight I looked drunk ect. The day after she was told this she reached out and offered to let me come get our son for the weekend. This was a real wakeup I took him to a water park for the weekend. On Sunday she called and informed me her and her mother had gotten into an argument and her mother kicked her out, she wanted to come stay with me cause she had no where else to go. I let her come back and one thing lead to another, the devorce was never finalized and here we are 9 years later. She has made it her lifes work to make up for the things she done, she has been the ideal spouse, devoting every waking moment to her family. She pushed me to be where I'm at professionally and I could have never done this  without her. But I still have triggers, i still have nightmares at times. I wake up back in that moment those few months when I was scum of the earth. I'll be depressed when these days hit and I'll feel fine once the days behind me. It hasn't happened in awhile however now we're to the point of the post.

Few days ago it hit me, bad dream. I'm tied to a tree, she's having sex with another guy right in front of me. They both pick up ball bats and start hitting me. I'm blooded I'm beaten and I wake up. In the past she's comforted me in these moments, this time she shrugged it off, made a joke about it and told me she's not going no where just cheer up. I continue my day and did just that left it to the wayside. Then last night she makes another joke saying her and her friend talked about my dream and she's not leaving for a man if she ran off it would be with her bff and there leaving the kids with the husband's. The fact that she's making a joke of this bothers me, im torn I don't know if I'm stuck on a past where I don't know what all really went on, I don't know if it's the idea of her making a joke feels like the cruel woman's back. I'm scared to talk to her because I know how that talk goes, I can't let the past die, I can't just move on speech that leads to an argument. My stress levels are already through the roof with everything else going on from work, family, covid-19 ect I just needed her support and I feel like my emotional downturn was a laughing point."
1399,What's wrong with me?,"I have had depression for 3-4 years ( I am 18) and now I guess I feel better . I know what I want to do and how I should start to do these things(baby steps). But when it comes to actions,  I just do nothing and continue to live like always. What's wrong with me ? Is this mean that I am too afraid to leave my comfort zone ? How to force myself to change things? I am so sick of living this way..."
1400,Does anyone know any tips for social anxiety?,"Like whenever i'm in public how can I calm myself down, and how can I be okay surrounded by people? Any experience people w social anxiety that knows any tips?"
1401,I am a cold-hearted monster ÔwÔ,"My paternal granddad and grandma passed away 1+ and 2+ years ago respectively. I was very sad when those events happened but thankfully I wasn’t *extremely* psychologically affected. Does this make me bad btw?

But that isn’t exactly my main point I want to discuss, it’s about something that happened literally just now. My dad was very affected by this and says he felt very depressed after his parents passed away (idk how my aunts and uncle have been affected over the years). And right now my dad was just crying whilst looking at pictures of Granddad and so I went to see him and gave him a hug and i don’t know how but when I let go, I didn’t do it consciously but sort of pushed him away bc I guess I don’t really like being that close face to face. If you have ever been hugged, you’ll probably know that when you let go you’re kinda close y’know. And so that set Dad off and he always says I treat him like a plague bc of the covid thing (he goes out almost every day although that doesn’t affect me as much as it did, say, in early to mid April) and that made me feel bad idk he kinda just makes me hate myself more. I tried cutting myself with this plastic ruler/protractor/triangle fusion thing I have but I stopped and it didn’t do anything to me compared to when I stabbed myself with a pen on Thursday and almost two weeks ago. Have a nice day!"
1402,Can anyone suggest the next best thing to a hug?,"No pets.

No healthy adult connections.

Drop in IQ

Got to a great place recently just to be destabilised again by abusive behavior. 

I need people but don't like them. The ones I do like don't like me.

Feeling often like a child.

Everything feels bleak.

Suggestions to make the loneliness feel good again?

Did anyone go through a stage where people couldn't tolerate them and vice versa but made friends. Am adult past 28yrs"
1403,Why do my emotions feel so muted?,"It's been a problem a lot lately, does anyone else have this issue? It's been bothering me especially because my empathy seems to have died now. Watching videos of the recent police brutality in the US and reading articles about it used to fill me with rage, but a little ways back some sort of switch flipped. I don't feel anything particular when I see these things anymore, and it worries me.

I used to have massive anger problems but those have seemingly vanished as well, I don't get worked up as easily now. On top of that, I don't really feel as if I have a direction in life either. I waste all of my time every day trying not to think about how I don't really serve a purpose aside from keeping my family and friends happy, and I feel my life is too fucked to get it straightened out now. I don't know what I'm doing.

Does anyone else have any advice from getting to a better position mentally? Do I need to be drinking more water or something?"
1404,how can I deal with anxiety?,"Anxiety was something that I never thought of as being a big deal right up until now in my college years. It's because it has never interrupted my way of life. I was happy and carefree. 

Now in college, I feel overwhelming anxiousness to the point of being unable to sleep without worrying or creating scenarios in my head that doesn't end well. It's a lot of 'what ifs' : what if this email doesn't go through? It would be my fault. what if the admins are thinking that I'm being too pushy for a reply? what if I'm not being professional enough? what if I fail this assignment because I didn't draw this object perfectly? What if my lecturer hates me for not getting it right on the first go? what if I leave a bad impression on this person? 

I tend to overcheck things like checking if I sent the email to the right person thrice, checking if I filled in the form right at least 5 times, checking if my cart was filled with the right things 3 times, and such. In situations where I am not in control, my mind tends to wander and question if I did the right thing : was my pin correct? Is this waiter annoyed that I'm taking so long to order? Etc. 

I realise that when I get anxious I pick on my acne a lot and this causes me to feel even more anxiety because now my face looks terribly scarred and every one will start commenting on my face. 

I would greatly appreciate it if you guys could share any advice in how I can cope with anxiety because I don't want this to take over my life. 

Thank you xx"
1405,Due to Covid 19 I cannot see my family doctor or arrange therapy,"I have gotten worse in these times and I do not know what to do. I have gotten hard back into my alcoholism and quit my essential job today because I don’t see anything as a matter anymore. The most I can do is get a refill on my Zoloft since I only have two left. I am a 20 year old man, I watched every tragic stage of my father dying of stage 4 brain cancer, it happened very fast and I heard his last breaths when I was 15. I don’t know what to do in these times. I was at the top of my list in town for therapy but never took it seriously since I was high on incredible drugs like meth or crack, which I’d come down off of Halfway through and have to cut them short. I do cocaine occasionally but my main problem is alcoholism now, because a horrible shroom trip made me develop panic disorder so I can’t smoke marijuana anymore. If there are any professionals who happen to be on this subreddit I beg you for help, before I do something to myself, or others."
1406,have been having panic attacks and constant hallucinations,"This isn’t much but recording what’s going on so I’m sorry if it’s too vague and uninteresting. the panic attacks usually are about death... life... whatever. I’m scared of dying and not sure that I’m really alive. It doesn’t feel real. I feel like I’m a failed experiment. A lot of my thoughts contradict each other and I understand that but it doesn’t make it feel less real. Wearing masks to stores has been causing them too. I’m not really sure why, maybe just combined with social anxiety it’s too much. 

I’ve had hallucinations for as long as I can remember. Right now they’re constant though. It’s most corned of my eye. It’s to the point where I’m scared to look away from the wall. Some of it is illusion. Most are still hallucinations. I don’t do drugs and I’ve gotten okay sleep. They’re starting to go into auditory too just no where near as often. Paranoia isn’t helping at all. Can’t relax."
1407,What does it feel like to want to live?,"I’m not actively suicidal, but where’s the line? It’s getting blurry. I can’t see the boundary. What does it feel like to have a desire to live?"
1408,Social anxiety is making me want to give up,"Everytime I think things will get better, I find myself in the same pit again. Nobody likes me, I'm weird, nobody wants to spend time with me/talk to me/engage in an activity with me. I was supposed to have  a great training session, it helps me deal with my mental health, but we were uneven in the group. I always end up alone, without a partner, nobody wants yo practice or spar with me. I can't deal with this amymore. An acticity that gives me joy, helps me with depression and PTSD, makes me almost physiclly throw up when my social phobia gets triggered and too over whelming. 

It feels like I'll never get rid of the problem, what's the point of living. I just wanted to vent, maybe ut feels better even if no one will ever know or understand me. I'm tired of being judged, I'm tired of hearing that I'm weird and sonething's wrong with me. It just makes it worse."
1409,Dealing with mentally ill parents. (share your stories?),"My mother has gone through a series of events over the course of her life that has lead her to having bad mental-health. Owing to this our family has gone through a whole lotta shitty times and my mother has severely struggled to avoid depression and anxiety. She is in a stable place now, but as a result of what i previously mentioned her outlook on life is really really negative. She believes in a lot of conspiracies and sees a lot of good-things as a rouse or government smoke-screens hiding underlying issues etc... My mother is a fantastic mother, and has given me an amazing upbrining, but this recent ""Black Lives Matter"" movement has brought out the worst in her with a some racist undertones. I have gone through a lot of phases of coming to terms with all this and often when i actively try to do something i make matters worse. Im at my witts end and find it really really hard to sit passively and observe what is happening. **I am not making this post to look for answers** (I know everyone's situation is very different) **but i was hoping to hear some stories or get a discussion going on dealing with mentally ill parents.** With luck, these would help me, and others, gain some perspective to help us deal with this."
1410,I told my whole family I was raped by my dad my whole life...,"Back in 2018, I told everyone in my family my dad raped and sexually molested me from ages 7-15. (Conditioning started well before that) responses were: from my brother, “I’m just trying to be friends with everyone.” My aunt, “I can’t uninvite to the camping trip, that’s not proper” my mom cuts me off whenever I have mental breakdowns towards her (I just get blackout angry &amp; mean, not to make excuses for that behavior but...) everyone else, “just forget about it to show him you don’t care.” LOLLLLLLLLLLLLL FUCKING COWARDS

Short story, he’s still living his best life. 

But what’s really fucking with my mental health right now is all the people who I confessed to are out here posting BLACK LIVES MATTER (which is fucking with me a whole different way) &amp; have basically shunned and black sheeped for being brave and not staying silent. I’m mad. They’re ugly hypocrites.

I’m not really well right now."
1411,"Please, I need input from an unbiased third party","I oscillated between very motivated/happy and very down in the last few weeks (I am not depressed).  There a few circumstances in my life that stress me a lot. I am 25 and currently live in my parents house due to covid-19, will move out again once over, have an appartement but I am here to be with them and because college is online. I will try my best to be brief.

\- I mostly live of my parents and am not finished with college at 25, I work in my field (stem) next to college but it disgusts me that this is the case and I think everyday about just taking out students loans, even though I don't need to. I often think that I 

\- I have become very nihilistic, not in my thinking so much, but in practice (I do not believe life is inherently meaningless, but sometimes I think in my own ""cost/benefit anaylsis"" it is not worth it). In the last 2 months I have often thrown things, punched walls and so on. The thing which scared me about this is that when you don't care about anything, all options are on the table and I might just destroy my life for good

\- I'm extremely indifferent about things in my environment, I can ignore an untidy room or a phone which is practically falling apart for months with ease

\- I am a sensitive person and I hate it (to empathetic), it makes emotionally intense situations very different to tolerate. To remedy this over-sensitivity I have killed a rabbit which my bare hands. I was very difficult and not fun, I am not a psychopath. I will know if it made a difference when I get into the next emotionally intense situation. If you think this is an extreme measure, it is but it was the only idea that was left to numb myself 

\- I was bullied as a child due to my being a bit out of the norm, I was suspected to have aspergers a few years ago when I was in a hospital for depression, it makes sense in way, you know, I was always a bit naive when it came to interpersonal stuff. When someone provoked me who was weaker than me I basically just walked away. But getting older this has left me with like 7 chips on my shoulder. I often think that I still have to get even for that , which I think I should if it were not for the possible legal/professional consequences

\- I don't see my life become better over time, even if I would earn a lot of money which I might

\- If I will commit suicide it will either be through Ketamine or suicide-by-cop, I am well equipped for both, but I can't do this as long as my family lives which makes me feel trapped in a way. It also means I have to stay around for some of the most painful experiences of my life, the death of my  closest family members

\- Due to this nihilistic thinking my behavior is becoming increasingly unhinged and in a way it scares me because I believe I might throw my life away in a way and regret it later on. I have drunk the whole last week, before that I was working out and doing good. Alcohol is not something I usually consume. I do not know where this is supposed to lead when I already think like this when I am still quite young. 

\- I believe my parents had very hard lives which is why they placated and sheltered me which has lead to low self-esteem. They want to do everything for me under the guise of 'helping' me but don't realize why I dislike it. They will for example ask me if I need help or want something and if I say not they will still do it. I know they only have the best intentions but think it induced some kind of 'learned helplessness' in me.

\- I have struggled with PIED which has caused me to isolate from my friends and to become withdrawn, it is extremely disheartening

\- despite how negative this sounds I actually can do very good on a day-to-day basis, I take my vitamins, help people out, study hard, refrain from instant gratification and work in my field which actually became very passionate about. I can be very contend. Am I just imposing arbitrary standards on myself when it comes to where I should be in live a 25 ? I know I am definitely my own worst enemy in some cases. To be honest I have quite a negative bias when it comes to myself, which was probably caused by my bad childhood experiences. I just don't want to hurt the people closest to me, which why I must strive to live a happier life. Its just seems that I have these demons (not literally) inside of me, I am just an emotionally pained person that better needs to learn to better deal with themselves I think.

1413,How do I stay productive?,"I suffer from chronic depression and anxiety and other stuff so maybe that's why I get so crazy restless and bored when I try to do anything that I end up chewing on my skin. There were a few times where I managed to work for multiple hours, but every time my eyes are bloody red, which is embarrassing. I get a headache and my blood pressure spikes and I have weird sensations like body itching. Then I look at my colleagues and they have enough energy to joke about things and fool around. Like, how are they doing this? Where do they have the energy? I have increased my discipline and my GPA is much better in uni than in school, because I do complex tasks well but I still fail at simple tasks. I can be extremely productive in short bursts, but afterwards I'm depressed and exhausted. I don't want to be lazy, but I'm worried that I'll snap. Am I overreacting? Should I just try to push through?"
1414,What should I expect from therapy and how should I prepare?,"I am a 16 year old male with depression and I recently managed to convince myself to ask my parents if I can maybe start seeing a therapist. They were both so supportive and my mom said she will start checking if there are any good therapists in the area.

I don't know how it'll go though. What should I expect? Would it be mostly just me talking and the therapist listening and asking questions? Or will there be more than that? And how can I prepare myself for whatever is about to happen?"
1415,TW: Self-harm,"—————————
TW: self-harm
—————————

I *hate* the heat, and I don’t do well in it. I’m super sensitive to heat and humidity, and the moment it gets to me, I get light headed, dizzy, and I just lose all coordination. I’m always in shorts or dresses, which means now I can see my scars more often. Which is making it really tempting to start cutting again. I wear jeans at work (literal hell), so I’m not as worried that people are going to see them. My anxiety has been at an all time high- as I’m sure most peoples’ are. I have everything, but honestly my ADHD is so bad, I never remember. I’m always circling in between like 10 different tasks at a time. But it’s getting harder now that I’m running out of things to do. I know I should talk to my therapist about it. I’m nervous that she’s going to do something more drastic if I tell her I want to hurt myself. She knows I purposefully keep everything incredibly superficial so I never have to get medical attention. What would she be allowed to do knowing that I’m (hypothetically) hurting myself? Does it make a difference that I’m not “seriously” injuring myself? (I feel like I’m justifying it by saying “not seriously”)"
1416,My friendship subscription with my bestfriend ended,"This might be a bit long so I'll apologise in advance. 

Recently, my bestfriend (online friend) cut off her relations with me. She was one of the people that meant a lot to me and vice versa. As in the only one I could vent to about anything without the fear of being judged. However, she had an irl bestfriend (her school friend). Unfortunately they were always there for each other and that other one was always paranoid someone's gonna replace her. She doesn't like her making friends, especially online. I knew about this, but I thought she would talk it out to her friend someday and be sorted. 

Didn't happen.

She was however treated very poorly by her irl friend but she's really been there for her in hard times from a long period so she usually waves it off. However, recently I noticed she would talk very less, sometimes a whole day by without any message. I tried initially, but she excused herself being busy so I didn't really want to bother her. One day I get a message from her saying we can't communicate anymore, not because her other friend found out, but because she's in a way lying to her friend by not telling about me.

Now we were twitter friends. So I expected she meant she doesn't want to keep connections with any online friends and she said she would deactivate. She did deactivate and that affected me a lot but I was helpless, there was no way I would be chosen above an irl bestfriend. Days later I try to check her profile and she's back, doesn't text me but still interacts with her friends on timeline. In fact she made another account which I found out through a common friend of ours and she spends her time there.

So I confronted her today and she just plainly went that she tried to feel bad about leaving me but it wasn't natural, and she forced herself. And whenever she would watch a 'funny' video or talk to someone she would forget me. Then she said she felt I never had an impact on her life. Now this is coming from a person who I treat better than my own family or any other friend. And It was surprising and kind of depressing for me because there were a ton of times she would just suddenly tell me that she's afraid of losing me and made me promise a million times that I'll always be with her.

I just feel stupid"
1417,"Sometimes I wonder if I have undiagnosed Asbergers, or primary school was that bad. And I honestly don't know.","What do I do? How do I secretly go to a professional if I still live with my parents? Should I even go? I'm really scared of this, because in my country going to a therapist, or any kind of mental health help is seen as worse than being an alcoholic."
1418,I feel like I’ve stopped feeling all emotion but stress,"For a few years I believe I’ve stopped feeling much emotion other than stress. I say believe because I struggle to recall how my emotions should feel at a normal level. Sometimes I doubt myself and tell myself this is normal and life is grey and bland, but I can’t help but think this isn’t normal.

Bit of background, I’m a guy in my mid 20s, family come from a country where mental health is very taboo. Plenty of Violence and abuse in my childhood, very messy situation with parents that hated each other, where my brother and I became their physical and emotional outlet. Tbh I recall good Memories from my childhood and look back on it with nostalgia and good times. When I think deeply about the abuse I do get caught up in a whirlwind of bad thoughts and often have to sort of pull myself out of those thoughts or I just end up crying. I know it’s just not right to go through these kinds of things growing up, but it’s also not the most abnormal thing in the world, especially in some countries. If anyone could share some experience, advice or even just if they relate? I want to start feeling happiness and excitement again. I’m literally always stressed and can’t feel like I’m constantly pulling a smile because if I wasn’t, people would just see the bland almost depressed facial expression I naturally sway to when I feel this way. Feels ridiculous writing this because in some ways I recognise I sound a bit mopey, but I genuinely want to get better and think a lot about this.

Just thought I should add that I’ve never had therapy or anything like that before - mental health really was stigmatised at home. When schizophrenia is no different to depression in the eyes of my family I was just always a bit scared to be one of those kids who got help."

I'm having a trouble to sleep every night I just basically cry or I just watched movies just to forget how painful it is to be separated. We're just a friend back then.. that person likes me first of course I don't know how to react but I'm overwhelmed.. I'm very happy that SOMEONE FINALLY LIKES ME! After that I simply offer my kindness first then eventually I decided to confess that my feelings towards that person got deeper I said ""I like you."" We stayed for about 2years then I discover that that person likes more people than I thought. After sometime we have many misunderstandings then that person decided to end our relationship. My birthday is on June 10.. 4days to go until my birthday and she decided to end it at the end of May. It hurts, it really hurts... All my sacrifices is just gone I know myself that I made mistakes too but I work it out to do the right to let that person to know how much I like ... To stay... All my insecurities just popped up again and it's eating me.. I promised that this year will be our greatest year but I'm wrong.. it's just hard to talked to someone about how you feel without being bash or something but I'm just not mature enough to accept things that easy. That person supposed to be my last.
I just let out my feelings because I'm thinking of bad things to end my life without hurting my parents but in the end of the day I don't want to disappoint them or to give them a problem. I don't want them to worry:) maybe I'm so selfish that's why everyone leaves everyone think I'm weird because I'm quiet but I just don't want to get attached to anyone again."
1423,Quarantine Craziness,"That awkward moment when you've been quarantined for 3 months with a racist, abusive parent and another parent that condones the abuse, and you can't walk due to achilles tendonitis in both ankles, and quarantine just got extended for another month and you're going a little crazy, and have three preexisting overlapping mental health conditions that already made your life suck enough without all this extra absurdity happening, but black lives have always mattered and you should let all the ads play in this video [ https://youtu.be/bCgLa25fDHM ] because 100% of the ad revenue will be donated to organizations supporting the BLM movement, which means you can still support BLM without paying any money out of pocket and without ever leaving your home"
1424,I dont feel well.,"I have 5 days off work and nowhere to go, nothing to do. Ive started feeling pointless. Just spent ages trying to get rid off all the disgusting hair off my face (im female) and all the time a voice was telling me not to bother, i'll still be fat and ugly and boring and worthless.
Thoughts keep popping into my head about just disappearing. That no one would notice. Or care.
I live on my own and I'm worried its just going to escalate more over the 5 days.
Does anyone have any tips on how to shut it out?"
1425,I wish life had a pause button and fast forward button.,I’m basically in a really bad place right now. And I wish I could either pause time to heal. Or fast forward in time to when I’m done healing.
1426,I often think about ending it these days,"About two weeks ago, I decided I would pretend I was pregnant just to see how my parents would react. They told me that I would have to leave the house immediately and that I was making this worst decision of my life to carry the pregnancy. 

About three years ago I gave birth to my son. I was staying with them while pregnant. I gave up my son for adoption because they repeatedly told me they would not be able to let me live with them and that they didn't want to help me. I was homeless for 5 years before becoming pregnant and wasn't sure if I could do it alone. 

Now I'm alone all the time. No friends, no parties, no boyfriend. Just the other week I was dumped by a hookup because he told me one of his longtime friends revealed she had feelings for him. He was number 46 out of all the men I've had sex with. 

No relationship so far. Now I feel used up and bitter and like I know too much and am undesirable. Like no man will ever want me. And I really do want a relationship. But I'm too tired to search at this point. 

I'm 33 and feel so exhausted. I don't feel like I can go out there and ""make it."" I ended up homeless the first time that I moved away from my parents. I don't feel like I can make monthly rent payments and keep myself afloat. I can't have another baby here at my parents place. I want to have another baby. But if I do, they will kick me out. 

I've helped them a lot and they benefit from having me at the house, but not enough to say that they need me. Nobody needs me. My son is taken care of. I can see him once a year but even that's looking less likely as he gets older and his adoptive mom doesn't extend the offer like she used to. 

I think about maybe stepping in front of a train. Cutting myself? Maybe feeding a pipe through my car window that's attached to my muffler. I think to myself ""I don't even want to be here."" The thoughts of suicide bring me relief. 

My mom says if I killed myself I would ""devastate the family."" I guess that's the only thing stopping me for now but lately I'm not so sure. I just want an end to my suffering and don't feel like I can make a life for myself. 

Thanks for reading."
1427,Difficulty crying.,"Whenever I watch or experience something sad I get all the preambles to crying: Tightened throat, eyes feeling funny, shaky and slow breathing etc. But I very rarely seem to actually cry (the last time being around 6 months ago), it's quite frustrating as I like the emotional release that comes with crying and would like to experience, it's like my whole body is ready to cry and my mind wants to but I just don't. Basically what I'm asking is, is this normal? If not, why? Mainly just wanted to vent, sorry if this is not the right sub for this I just couldn't think of anywhere else."
1428,I don’t know where to post this but it’s driving me insane,"SHORT VERSION AT THE BOTTOM

I never ever feel safe in my own home. I always see a figure standing outside my window, in or outside my closet, down the hallway at night. I constantly feel watched like this person is always their maliciously waiting to harm me. One time i even had a issue with i think sleep paralysis and this figure looked at me from the closet and i stared as it slowly started creeping out of it then dashed full speed over me (which I completely felt its weight on my chest as it climbed over) and it layed on my bed to the right of me and stayed. I could not move. Then i was awake for sure and felt COMPLETELY conscious and I still felt it next to me but I was completely paralyzed. It then ran really fast beneath my bed. This thing is constantly watching me from my closet. Sometimes it comes out and i see it dash. I don’t know what is wrong with me I hate this and i hate that I can’t feel safe in my own home. I can’t talk to anyone about this either because the parent i live with does not believe in mental illness and has a variety of issues and we are not close. The other parent never even responds after the first conversation of me talking about depression and seemingly forgets it. Also about this weird figure this has only been going on constantly for about a year. Before that i had only rarely seen it except for when i had what i called “episodes” that involved my entire surroundings going insane and me having basically panic attacks with all my regular feelings nowadays amplified. One more thing from past and present that is the same now is hearing voices out of nowhere especially when i try to sleep. I usually hear a “hello” “wake up” or a creepy laugh in some strangers voice that I suspect is this figure. While going to sleep/waking up this figure has also pushed my chest. 

Before all of these more extreme things for my entire life I felt like someone was watching at times but was always reading my thoughts. Nowadays i am constantly paranoid and miserable and im scared to talk about it and sound crazy. I know what i am experiencing isn’t real but i dont know why.

SHORT VERSION: I feel like i am constantly watched and my thoughts are read. I constantly am paranoid and see the same black figure everyday in one of three places. 

Could I have an additional mental illness besides depression and anxiety? (Both were confirmed when i used to have therapy a few years ago)"
1429,Would you be happier if you didn’t have social media?,I’m curious.
1430,I have jealousy OCD,Not retroactive jealousy OCD.The thing is I can't tell anymore if it's intrusive thoughts or that I'm actually a jealous and envious person.The thoughts seem so random and it makes me envy and be jealous of everyone.The funny thing is jealousy and envy is about wanting something that someone else has but I don't.The thoughts just won't go i am contemplating suicide even though I know I can't go through with it.
1431,For the past year my step sister has been sexually harrasing me.,"It started a year ago when me and my step sister got into a intercourse. The next morning I was bawling crying because of guilt. it happened 2 times after that and those times I woke up crying, after the third time I decided to stop doing it because it was wrong so I haven't done it for nine months but she still will grab my penis and I just have to back away or stop me in doorways and grab my hands and put them on her breasts. I just don't know what to do I feel alone in this."
1432,Attempts on my life in the mental health system,"G'day Reddit. I am freaking out about the fact that I have had 2 attempts on my life thought out my experience with the mental health system. I trusted them to deliver my medication safely. 

How ever when I was in hospital. I was deliberately given a medication overdose. From what I recall it was meant for another patient not for me. They later denied that it was deliberate and said that it was an unfortunate accident.

After being released from hospital back into the community I thought I was safer and could trust them to deliver my medication again.

I rely on carers to come to my house and deliver my mental health medication.

I had a second attempt on my life. When a complete stranger actually showed up at my house with mental health medication and gave me an what I believe was either an overdose or an attempt to poison me. Which I didn't realize until later that night that he wasn't one of my normal carers. Then I started having the same symptoms of an overdose as the first time I was given an overdose. I also realized that the medication pack didn't look like my normal meds.

So I took my self to hospital told them what happened but they didn't believe me and sent me back to the psych ward. Where they asked me stupid questions like is there a plot to kill you etc.

What I found out later is that a van was stolen from my carers and used to deliver me mental health medication but even after pointing out this fact I still wasn't believed.

Since then I have been reading about carers who kill apparently it's a pretty big problem in my country."
1433,"I’m buying pc parts and I’m having this weird feeling of regret, even though I’m looking forward to it.","I’m currently buying a $700 pc with a $250 monitor, and I’m having indecisive thoughts of whether I should make it less expensive, even though I know I have the money to afford it. I’m just so worried that I might regret the purchase. I’m mainly going to use it for gaming, but I know games are a waste of time. That is what bothers me. I’m spending nearly $1000 on something that’s a waste of time. To me, as a 15 year old teenager, $1000 is a huge amount. My family is well off, so $1000 won’t bother them as much as it bothers me but I still can’t shake a weird feeling when I’m ordering such expensive pc parts. 
Any suggestions?"
1434,An exam in university has been ruining my life.,"Hi there. I'm now a university student since 2016 and there is one exam that dramatically changed me. I have this calculus exam that's one of the exams of the first year of my degree that completely destroyed me. I've done it now  17 times and soon I'll do it for the 18th and also for the last time. This exam is probably a type of exam that many universities have, were only 10% or less pass the exam and usually half of them cheated their way out. I've done it so many times that a I feel physically sick everytime I need to start and study for it. Because of this exam I developed tremour in my hands in situations of high stress, I started feeling nausea before exams and now I will change university.

I come from a family were we never give up, that was my mentality during this four years. I worked harder everytime going always over my limits but I never passed it. Not only that, but twice already the teacher simply told me he wouldn't make me pass it because there was something in the exam he felt it wasn't perfectly accurate. Not wanting to change degree or university I kept working on it but I never received the price I've worked so hard for. Now after four years my parents told me they don't want to see me suffer like this anymore so I'm changing university and degree moving from engineery to biology.

Ultimatelly I just wanted to know if there's someone that had a similar situation and what did they do. I learned so many things from this experience but I would like to know other similar stories to analyze other possible outcomes and solutions if something like this happens in the future. Thanks for reading and I wish you all a great day."
1435,Can’t get happy. Everything feels ruined again.,"I don’t know how to start this. All my life I’ve had trouble being happy. I’m 24, and my teenage and adult life has been a rollercoaster. I’ve found “love” twice since I was 18 and the first time ended in me moving across the country to live with family because we broke up and I had nowhere to go and I needed to get away from her. Now I’m here again. In a new relationship, in a lease, and the relationship is fucked. Both of us are to blame in certain aspects. But the bottom line is here I am again. When I fall in love, I fall in love so hard. This isn’t easy with me and I’m scared. I don’t know where I’m going to go, she has two kids from a previous relationship so obviously she can stay in apartment. I guess I’m going to have to find a room to rent but I don’t have very good credit. I feel so alone. I don’t have any family left to help me, I don’t have anywhere to go. I feel like a failure. The person i really love doesn’t want me anymore and that’s the hardest pill to swallow. I want to die or to kill myself so badly but I can’t bring myself to do it. I know I’ll be too scared. I just feel hopeless."
1436,The mandala,"I thought I would share an insight from therapy and a project I’m working on for my own mental health and wellness. 

I suffer from self-esteem and self-concept problems (among others!) and often sometimes I get really hard on myself and the next thing I know I feel worthless. I tend to seek external validation when this happens and I realized that this is unhealthy and I should learn skills to maintain my set-esteem and worth internally. 

So knowing that I tend to seek validation externally I decided to draw a symbol that comes from within called a mandala. Carl Jung wrote about them a lot and a link is below. 

Basically my project is to spend a day thinking well of myself. Not in an inflated sense but just positive thoughts. Through meditation I with just let my mind wander in this state and then draw whatever symbols some to me. I will carry this drawing around and look at it when I feel my self-esteem starts to slip. My hope is that looking at this symbol that was created in a positive mental state will help me regulate. 

I don’t know how well this will work but I believe that it will. I share this in hopes that maybe somebody else may find the idea useful for their own mental wellness or maybe just the idea will inspire or motivate them to find their own way to self-regulate.

1437,Feeling physically heart broken," I'm 20F and when I was 18, I went through a period of just mindlessly sleeping around with anyone. It was mostly because I had always been so insecure of my own physics that I tried so hard to prove to myself and my peers that I could also be the cool girl. Before I was sexually active, I honestly never thought I can be seen as desirable by any one of the opposite sex. Boys make me feel seen and validated. I got so hooked on that excitement of getting someone new that the body count just kept on piling up. Although I managed to seperate casual sex from romantic connection, I eventually got caught up in a fling that ended up in a messy situationship. Since the whole thing between us revolved just around sex, our dynamic was undeniably just toxic. I romanticized his possessiveness, and shrugged off the fact that he treated me like shit all the time. When I was with him, I craved the validation and attention from him so much that I would honestly do whatever he told me to. Even when it crossed my boundaries, I never turn down his demands as I never wanted to upset him. I just wanted to be loved so bad that I picked up even the tiniest crumb of affection that he gave. I kept trying so hard to be the perfect “girlfriend” for him just to maybe one day be truly accepted as one, yet I was constantly feeling that I wasn't good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the breaking point when I found out that he met a girl on his vacation and told me how he felt so connected to her, how he was devastated to leave her and just can't wait to see her again. I was absolutely crushed. How could he feel so deeply connected to a girl he just met, while I was there first. We had a huge row that night. He kept explaining how our connection was only sexual and I was too young for him and how our relationship wasn't gonna last anyway. At that point, a part of me agreed with everything he said, but I couldn't help but feel betrayed as I had given so much love for him. I was completely heartbroken and wanted to push him away so bad. But when I said that I wanted to end our relationship, he immediately switched his behaviour and begged me to stay. He said he was sorry for how stupid he was and I was his only baby. Of course, I stayed.

&amp;#x200B;

That mess lasted for another 5 month before we finally broke up. Although we managed to talk it out and ended on good terms, the whole thing just left a huge wound in my self-esteem. I fell back into that route of fucking strangers just to feel better and constantly got the urge to sexualize myself to be desired. But after all the fun and excitement, I just felt empty. All the guys just wanted me for sex, since as soon as I tried to spark a meaningful conversation I wasn’t that hot and fun anymore. As if they just want me to shut up and be their fuck doll. I felt like I wasn't worthy of love at all. I kept on thinking that if I had been more conventionally attractive, and didn't have to be so good at giving blowjobs to be liked by guys, someone would actually have a true emotional connection with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I bumped into this guy. It was supposed to be a purely sexual relationship, as we agreed to be just friends with benefits in the first place. It turned out that we are so much more compatible than we even expected. He was like my best friend and for the first time ever I was able to talk to someone about anything for hours and hours. Whenever there's an issue, we would confront it together and talk openly about our emotions. It was the first time I've ever felt so intimately connected with a partner, and for the first time things seemed like it might get somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

It didn’t

&amp;#x200B;

As much as we shared romantic feelings toward each other, his perspective on love life is rather different than mine. Although we both agreed that soulmate or “the one” doesn’t exist, I do believe that a long term partner is necessary, while he doesn’t really think so. Despite the fact that he admit not having any polyamorous experience before, he is very open to non-monogamy and is confident in his ability to love multiple people at one time. He swore by the fact that he doesn’t get jealous and believes that possessiveness shouldn’t be romanticized in relationships, which is amazing. He was very affectionate and caring all the time, but not once did he seem to want to address his feelings to me. Once again, I felt like as if I’m doing something wrong. I was always questioning myself, am I that difficult to love? Am I not good enough? Even though the time we spent together was amazing and I always feel safe around him, I couldn’t help but doubt my own self worth every single second. Unfortunately, we had to stop seeing each other due to the Covid-19. We are still good friends, but not for once can I feel endearment from him. I’m just sad that I miss him so much and I think he is such a special person, but I fear that he will never feel the same way about me.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I think of the trauma I went through in these two relationships, I felt my heart actually crack, like it’s being squeezed. I think of how I kept trying in vain to just be appreciated and loved. I feel like I lose myself everytime I try to please someone, so that they would just stay. I feel weak, and hopeless in finding love. I don’t know if I can ever come across anyone that would reciprocate the amount of affection I give them. Whenever those thoughts run through my head, my heart can’t stop aching, so much that I feel it physically everytime. It hurts so bad but I just can not stop over thinking.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m trying my best to achieve self-love through taking care of myself properly first. I don’t want to come into a relationship as an empty cup anymore. I think I can do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading my vent. I hope you can share your thoughts or similar experience."
1438,People say they’re pro mental health but then give you shit for not wanting to do anxiety-inducing shit,"Any complaint about my job impacting my mental health, people say:

“Suck it up and do it. “
“Just get more meds.”
“At least you have a job.” 
etc.

without taking into consideration how it impacts my health. I am just so sick of it.

I really need to stop asking for people’s advice and do whatever I feel is right."
1439,"Meditation may have created a suffering/cleansing pattern in me. However, this time, the suffering feels as if it has gone too deep, too profound, advice appreciated","This will be very difficult to word. For reference, I have suffered multiple traumas in my life. I have been meditating daily for the past two years. For the past several months, I have experienced suffering like never before. It would either surface in meditation, in a dream, etc. and then I would go through a phase in life where it felt like my ego was being disintegrated (look up positive disintegration theory--felt like that) and then I would come out of it with a new understanding/blissful state.

This time however was different. Very different. I don't know if I went too deep. I felt suffering one day, and hoped to feel better. Within a few days, I woke up and felt such depth in my heart I knew that this was not something I was simply going to ""come out of."" I unlocked something which may have been in me my whole life, it may have been worse due to trauma, I don't know. But I unlocked something.

I lost hope this time. This is not to say I am textbook depressed: I have no issues getting up in the morning, I love myself, I want the best for myself, I am simply suffering badly. I feel pain in my heart. This has been going on since May 25th. A few days ago I was walking and somehow understood that in order to heal I must go through a wave of something bad, something dark, something overwhelming. Before this wave, it is like a slow, numb, slightly painful process where my mind was constantly neurotic and OCD like it usually isn't--like an ego gripping on.

Last night, the bad wave hit me. Traumatic thoughts raced through my mind (I don't think they are suppressed as I used to ruminate with these bad thoughts, like I knew they were there) and I felt pain I thought I had resolved, maybe this was trauma healing or maybe this was just my neurotic ego hurting me due to loss of control.

Either way, I sat with the awful feelings--there was nothing I could do. I meditated a little later, and felt a small purgatory effect. I felt like I got maybe 50% of the negative shit out, but I still have some to go.

I am just wondering if anyone can offer any input or advice. If quitting meditation is the best option, I am very hesitant to do so because I always feel there may be rewards at the end of the tunnel, but I don't really know where to go. I'm 22, maybe my ego is necessary.

I know many will recommend therapy, and I consider it, but in my usual patterns, I may reemerge out of this with a new understanding and not need therapy. I've been through similar things before, this specific case was just the mother of all cases. I did not know I could go so deep.

Much appreciated guys."
1440,Sleep issues,"I am a long term sufferer of depression and occasionally anxiety. I’m on the max dose of sertraline. 
I’m caring for an elderly relative, helping another, working from home (due to COVID) albeit shorter hours and battling with some health issues. I sleep well normally. I have to wear a cpap as I have sleep apnoea. During the pandemic my sleep has become increasingly problematic. I have not been able to shut off and am not going to sleep until 4-7am. Consequently I sleep all morning but wake up feeling wretched. I have sleeping tablets but they are not helping all that much and I’m afraid I will become dependant upon them. 
I feel really low. It’s coming up to Father’s Day and I miss my Dad. My teenagers are just being teenagers so that’s hard. I need good quality refreshing sleep. This tiredness is making my anxiety flare and I need to nip it in the bud. 
Any suggestions please?"
1441,KETAMINE (Fin),"Today is my first day since the completion of the two week Ketamine injection treatment for Suicidal Depression. It feels less heavy, and no suicidal thoughts to burden the mind.  I know I am feeling better and am in a better mood overall and have gradually felt this way over the course of the two week long treatment. Colors look a little prettier now and conversations are easier with people. I think I am enjoying things again."
1442,I think I have high-functioning anxiety.,"This has been going on for a while but I used to write and read a lot before COVID, and I would always be unhappy because with work and school I didn’t have time to do these things. Now I had all this free time and I thought it would do wonders but I don’t even read or write anymore and I’m still unhappy. I recently went back to work a few weeks ago and initially enjoyed the return to a routine but now I hate being there. I look forward to getting off so I can relax but I can never get comfortable and have to deal with consistent chest pain on the right side of my chest just under my pec.

I always think to myself “once ____ happens it’ll all get better” but it never does. Anybody else have any experience with something like this? I don’t know what to do."
1443,I feel like I’m the only one. Looking for direction. Here are my symptoms.,"Basically I have this thing where I put on an extremely extravagant act. Everything I do is geared to make people see me in a certain way. It’s really weird and really hard to describe but I’ve created this new persona I guess you could say. I am unable to stop “acting” and be myself no matter how hard I try. I can’t talk or even type in my “real” voice anymore. 

Anyways I really hope there is someone who can relate and has advice for me.

I find that i am happiest when I make myself as distant as possible with other people and the real world. Things like playing video games, being on the internet, and getting high are when I feel like I don’t have this persona on and I’m a real person.

It’s become really painful for me to be in the real world because I’m not a person there. If I were able to wander the world completely alone then maybe things would be different and less painful for me.

On top of this I feel really distant all the time. I think this is my brains way of saying “I don’t like that stuff get me away”. So I’m never really 100% there because being even 50% there causes me pain.

I digress. I know these symptoms and this line of thinking is very weird and I know few people can relate. Sadly it’s my reality, if there is anyone who can relate you couldn’t possibly imagine how much it would mean if you were to send any advice, personal experiences, or get in touch."

1445,it's important to hear and to be heard,sexual abuse or assault is something that is present in the fabric of our society. not only outsiders but there are families where sexual assault is being done behind the closed doors. its high time that we raise our voice against such monsters.  [https://tickle.life/sexual-abuse-and-incest/](https://tickle.life/sexual-abuse-and-incest/) I came across this post which shows what sexual assault can do to a person. we need to stand together as family or friends or even in the name of humanity to support each other and condemn such acts. this kind of thing has a deep-rooted impact on the person's mental health and overall personality development. talk and reach out to people who would listen to you and reach out as long as you are not being heard.

1449,Please help. My mum is becoming manic and I'm worried about her catching coronavirus," Hello, any advice on my current situation would be greatly appreciated. I'm panicking now, as I can see the familiar early signs of mania. 

  TLDR: My mum has severe Bipolar with psychosis and refuses to take medication; I would like any advice to help her realise that it would be better for her (and not just us) to take the medication and avoid becoming manic.

  I will try to keep the background brief. She has Bipolar and refuses to take her medicine, for more than a few weeks or a few months. While she knows what her other manias were like, she enjoys that initial buzz too much. She hates the side effects of the medication and has always been suspicious of mainstream medicine. She always insists that she is in control, she'll take it later, it won't happen this time. But she also hates being in hospital. She has been hospitalised against her will every time she has had  manic episode. She knows taking the medication would prevent this but still won't do it. She also doesn't take any advice related to her mental health.   

  Her manic episodes last several months and always ends up with her in a full blown psychosis; including thinking that the government and family members want to kill her. There are many long nights walking through town, getting away from white vans or people at bus stops. She will harass strangers, saying that she “knows what they are doing” and can end up raising her voice at them. She has never been violent though (other than breaking things). This has always been very worrying, but now that we are in the middle of a pandemic it will be even worse. She is in her mid sixties and not in good physical health; during manic episodes she is unable to care for herself properly. She has become homeless previously, due to her actions during mania. We live in the UK so are still under lockdown. 

 Mental health treatment is free under the NHS, but is massively underfunded so there isn't enough space in the psychiatric hospitals. Nobody gets sectioned (detained against her will) unless they are currently a danger to themselves or someone else, even if they have been recently. Which is incredibly difficult and means that her highest stage of mania can last for months with nothing we can do. Last time she has ended up disappearing to a hotel in another town where she trashed the room. The police were called and they just took her to another hotel. 

  I need some advice on how to talk to her. Any way to show her that it would be better to take the medicine now and not let the mania develop fully. Without making it look like I'm trying to control her.

1450,i’m killing myself,"there’s nothing wrong with me. i went to a psychiatrist who said i have absolutely nothing while he was blatantly dismissing my feelings throughout our session. i’ve talked to my parents a lot about my feelings and they get it. till they don’t, till they tell me nothings wrong with me. till they call me lazy. till they slam my door angrily when i decide not to talk to them. i’m so very tired. no motivational or inspirational crap is getting to me anymore. i need constant validation about my feelings and i hate it. whenever i feel anything theres this voice inside me telling me i’m faking it. i’m so fucking tired. i’m so tired i want to throw my guts up. it hasn’t gone away. it’s been two whole fucking years...i don’t care anymore. fuck, i can’t even self harm for god’s sake cause i’m getting flashbacks from the last time i did it. i don’t even know why i’m posting this here. a coping mechanism keeping me busy i guess."
1451,I don’t know why I did what I did,"I very much can be considered someone who would want attention from someone they love from time to time. I get bored easily, I’m pretty clingy to my significant other though I try to refrain from being too excessive (I was told by exes that it was annoying) I get anxious and scared when I don’t know of my significant other’s whereabouts, I’d cry if I don’t hear back from them 30 minutes after they said they’d be done with what they’re doing. And recently, I realise that I also hurt myself when I feel like I don’t get the attention I want from them. Whether be it cutting or slamming my head against the table repeatedly. I feel bad for doing something so stupid. I just want to know why I hurt myself. Am I attention seeking? Why do I worry about someone to the pointof tears even though they may not be in danger? Am I experiencing this because I’m an only child perhaps? I want to know."
1452,Helping someone while having boundaries,"Best way to help?

I’ve dealt with mostly mild depression and anxiety for the majority of my teen and adult life. I’ve had a few bad periods, but it’s mostly manageable. However, I’m struggling on how best to support my 16 year old son who also has depression and anxiety. He takes meds and sees a therapist, but doesn’t seem very engaged in trying to get better. He just wants to sit in his room most of the time and do nothing. I try to give him space, but I don’t feel it’s fair to the rest of the family that he should have no responsibilities, no contributions and almost no interactions with the rest of us. Most days, it feels like he is a tenant who happens to eat our food and make messes and laundry, but barely interacts otherwise. I told him early this week that we were visiting his aunt today as a whole family and to be prepared, but when I tried to get him to go, he refused and punched two holes in the wall. We ended up leaving him at home. I’ve tried looking into residential or outpatient treatment options, but he’s not suicidal, so most won’t take him and he’s not engaged, so many others would let him leave if he doesn’t want to be there. Do I just let him take advantage of the rest of us and contribute nothing to the family with zero accountability because he’s depressed? How can I support him while also having boundaries for myself and my other kids and spouse?"
1453,I don't know how I feel...,"I don't know how to explain how I feel so bare with me but have you ever felt guilty for feeling shitty towards your life and think ""why am I feeling this way if there are others going through worse?""

I just don't know how to not feel bad, I've also been feeling terrible physically the past two weeks and even then I feel it's my fault.

I’m looking for a reputable online mental health website, one that has someone to talk to and also can prescribe medicine. My sister recently had a baby and is suffering from ppa and ppd, she lives in a very small town where it’s hard to get in and see anyone. She has a therapist but won’t be able to see him for a while. She’s always suffered from depression and anxiety, she’s used CBD and smoked weed but it’s not helping like it used to. She was on Prozac and Zoloft when she was younger but she didn’t respond well to those. She’s tried CBD+Ashgawanda herb and that hasn’t seemed to help either.

At first I didn't like the quarantine, it disrupted my routine. I needed it to end soon. I cried at times, not because of the situation but many other issues. Now I got used to it and I'm relatively OK, as good as I can be. Now I realized I don't want it to end. Thinking of the ""new normal"" terrifies me. Am I the only stupid one feeling this way?"
1458,I feel like I’m just slowly dying inside.,"My mom died in April.  I’ve found out things about her and my also dead father that sent me reeling. It’s completely shaken my identity I feel. My career isn’t where I want it to be and I’m in college trying to further myself. I have a beautiful child you has been my biggest blessing and I feel like my baby keeps me alive, and I feel so much shame saying that. I can’t even say I want to live for myself. I’m clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression and anxiety induced insomnia. I feel like there’s no one I can talk to. I’m close with my sister but she literally has no clue what to say or what to do and it makes her really uncomfortable it’s something she’s never dealt with. My so asks and says he can tell something that is different but I feel like I can’t talk to him at all. I feel like I’m just fading away. After finding out all this information about my mom and dad and my childhood I feel like I can’t trust anyone. The state of my country right now is just making it worse. I’m so sad, I’m so empty, I know there’s a part of myself that is so full of life and love and adventure and I just feel like I’m losing it. I feel like I’m in yet another fight to control my mind and my mental illness and I feel like I’m losing and I feel like I’m tired of fighting it and it never becoming any easier to win. I want to get help or go to therapy but I can’t because I don’t have insurance and I can’t afford to pay for it. I need help. I really don’t know what to do anymore.

1459,Doubting Myself,"Whenever I have a thought about someone or something, I automatically start to argue with my own thoughts and I feel extremely insecure and anxious.

1460,Do I have an issue? Or am I just making a problem for myself?,"I struggle to trust anyone, so I don’t open up at all. Keep everything in my head, to myself, and just hide what I’m thinking as to not burden anyone else, or just because I can’t trust them. I know that people don’t lie often to me, but there’s times where it seems like whatever they say is just either lies or prancing around the truth, even I do that. And with that, it adds to the fact that I can’t trust people. 

I don’t have much motivation to do anything. Whether it be as bad as to get out of bed that day, or to do daily tasks around the house, or to work for university. I tend to get bored with trying to work for uni early and then just let it build it until I have 5 assignments due in two days’ time and then rush and struggle to get it all done, and no matter what, if I’m trying to concentrate on doing something for uni, the slightest of things distract me, any noise what so ever, so I listen to music to cut the noise out, but with that I just start zoning out. I can be reading a book and eventually end up in the middle of four different ones that I just leave for a couple of weeks. I smoke because of no other reason thboredom, just to be doing. 

I need to be helpful to others, but with that is the main need of wanting some sort of validation. But even when I do get validation from them for being there or doing something, it doesn’t mean anything to me, its like they are lying to me because I don’t see the good in what I actually did. I don’t see the reasoning behind doing it to begin with. Other than the validation that I don’t believe is genuine. 

I do not care about things.

I get angry over nothing, and then go looking for fights and arguments, and sometimes these arguments lead to me changing into a different person, fuelled by anger and disgust in myself and a lack of empathy and sympathy so I say things that I cant even think of normally and when its all over and done with, I feel vile and nasty because I know that what I did was not right and unnecessary, but there’s nothing that can change that. Its like I become somone else.

Building on that, yes everyone has their moods, so do I, moods of either anger for no reason, or completely ecstatic or just happy, either way, then moods of just “depression”(don’t know other words to really use), and there are also times of not feeling anything at all, not like neutrality, but like nothing at all. 

Does anyone experience this? Can anyone give some sort of explanation in regards to this? Is this just normal and I'm looking too much into this?"
1461,Things I Have Trouble Talking About With My Therapist... Any Advice?,"Warning: racism

Hey guys,

Clearly I'm on a throwaway account because of how embarrassed I am of talking about this. I'm just a lil under 18 now and have been in therapy for about 2 years on and off. Over those 2 years, I've been diagnosed with OCD, then depression, then generalized anxiety and social anxiety, and at some point experienced many BPD symptoms.

Yesterday I was speaking with an online friend about this particular habit I have that I have never communicated to my therapist and I realized how fucked up it is in light of recent events. Which is what brings me here.

Something I have noticed is that I talk to myself a lot when I'm alone. Not really talking, but more I just mutter insults to myself all the time. I wake up every day and one of the first things I repeatedly say to myself in the morning is ""I need to fucking kill myself,"" without even really thinking about it. Usually when I'm thinking of something distressing (i.e. I'm really scared of dying and that's one of the things I obsess over), I automatically mutter something of the sort to myself. However, it gets worse. 

I grew up in a pretty racist environment and will admit that in the past I was discriminatory to POC (not explicitly, but in my mind I did have a distaste for different ethnic groups). In my environment racial slurs were used a lot and acceptable, and thus, I grew up saying these words frequently in conversation, becoming quite the habit. Obviously as I got older, my social awareness improved significantly and I was no longer using these words so regularly. However, there is a significant issue I still deal with. Whenever I think about something to do with a bad social experience with people, I again, usually end up muttering something without really thinking about it. It's practically got out of my control at this point. But I've noticed that I use the particular n-word a LOT in these situations. Usually I'm alone, so no problem. But, sometimes if I'm explaining something traumatizing that happened in my life... I use the word to describe people in my life. It sounds so pretentious to say, but it really just ""slips out"" in those situations where I'm extremely anxious about what I'm talking about. 

I know it's as simple as ""just don't say it."" I know. I am so embarrassed of even typing this, let alone ever bringing it up with my therapist. It's just gone too far at this point. I really want to change but I have no idea what to do. I sit here, realizing that in a few months I'll be starting university. What if I accidentally say something of this sort in front of my peers? I truly never mean to offend anyone but it has just become such a deadly habit I am dying to break. 

Please don't take this post the wrong way. I'm not trying to be edgy, not trying to be subtly racist on this subreddit. I just genuinely want help.

Thank you."
1462,Am I a victim of trauma?,"So back in December, my room was quite a mess, and my mom saw it and became enraged. She screamed at me, threatened to hit me, threw a cup down on the floor and forbade me to sleep in my bedroom until it was perfectly clean (not a grain of dust anywhere clean). I cleaned it all within a day and was allowed to come back to my room. 

But every since then, I’ve been feeling Incredibly anxious about my mother coming into my room, if someone knocks on my door I will literally jump, I’m scared of being around my mom and have gotten anxiety attacks when she gets mad in another room, because I fear that she will come into my room to scream at me and kick me out again, even though my room is always perfectly clean. 

This doesn’t feel normal, has this event been traumatic or am I overreacting?"

2. I get various levels of whatever it is that doesn't let me work, sometimes I can comprehend simple information sometimes not
3. It looks like laziness but it's not because when I get relieved I work without a problem
4. Easy indicator of which state I'm in is with reading. I can either read with comprehension or read for a very short time without comprehension. Something is ""blocking it"" and I want to find out what
5. I can be in an unworking state for months, sometimes reaching almost a year"
1467,I can't take this,"I've finally reached my tolerance point. I can't take my mental decline anymore. I've decided to seek therapy but there's one huge problem. I can't.


I'm moving abroad in 2.5 months and apparently mental assessment + getting a therapist takes about 2 months here which means it wouldn't make sense to seek therapy only to see my therapist a few times before I leave. But I absolutely can't take this anymore, I've been postponing and making excuses for almost a year already. 


Something else that makes me even less willing to seek therapy now is that I should tell my parents about it which would worry them tremendously whereas if I wait those 2,5 months I wouldn't have to tell them. I don't know what to do, both seem like awful options."
1468,I don’t have another way out and I have an ethical obligation to kill myself.,"I don’t think that there is a way for me to get better. I have spent a year and a half dedicated only to trying to get better. At 17 years old I find myself In the exact same place I was as a 15 year old in sophomore year. People keep telling me “things will get better” I don’t think they will. I think I’m different. You can read my previous posts for a background of my symptoms. Anyways the only way I kind find any sort of joy at this point is by distancing myself from the world. Playing video games and being high are the only things that make me feel anything.

I digress, I think that I’m doing a disservice to myself and my family if I continue to live. A. I am putting myself in pain for no reason. I don’t think there is a point for me to suffer any longer. For a long time the thing that kept me from seriously considering suicide as my exit strategy was my family. 

Recently I came to the realization that I’m not going to get better. If I continue to live I will only be in pain for the rest of my life. This brings me to my second point. B. It’s unfair to keep my family hopeful. I’ve accepted the fact that My life on earth is done. I think it’s a fucked up thing to do to keep them thinking that things will turn around when they never will. It’s best to end my life so that they can let the thought of me go and get on with their lives.

I am pretty sure I’m going to go through with it. I’m going to go to one more therapy session. I’ll tell my therapist about my thoughts and give him a chance to convince me otherwise. My last hope is that these are just delusional thoughts that every person who is “depressed” has. Sadly I’m confident that I’m thinking clearly. 

I wish that I hadn’t been born. I wish that I didn’t have to worry about the well being of my family. It makes this so much harder. I want to get over with this and just be gone. Every time i look at any of my family members I want to cry. They have no clue how much pain I’m going to cause them. I hope they are all right. I fear I’m going to cause my parents to get a divorce or cause one of my family members to fall into depression. The world would be better without me. If I simply didn’t exist. Fuck this.

I digress, I’ll probably write a goodbye note to reddit. I’ll write one to my family and I will write a note to the world and society in general. 

Until then, I’m unsure of how I’m going to kill my self. I’m scared of using a knife or hanging myself. I don’t think I could cut myself and I’m scared banging myself won’t work. I don’t think I can get my hands on a gun because I live in an extremely privileged white community In the suburbs of Grand Rapids. I think the person who I would ask for a gun would be suspicious of me. I’ve thought about using my car but I don’t think I should fuck my parents over financially as well. This all leads me to pills. I don’t know what I would use but I need it to work. Surviving would be too much pain for me and for my family. Any suggestions drugs or otherwise are appreciated."
1469,Never happy with myself,"I always wondered how people are really happy with themselves for a long time. I have always thought im not AS pretty.. Not AS smart.. Not AS interesting etc..

Ive had this feeling for as long as i can remember myself, but recently it got a lot stronger since i got into a realtionship a year ago. Im always concerned hes going to find someone better, that im boring or ugly or just not for him.
He tells me its not true and it hurts him that for so long ive been feeling this bad even tho he told me otherwise.
I just cant stop and i dont even know how to explain it to him. I have ups and downs like anyone else but it feels like the downs are just outweighing any uos i had.

Living with anxiety while you have no one you can lean on is like living in hell. I have severe anxiety, I don't know how to deal with this anymore since I'm tired having it for 8 years and a half. It makes me think about non existent negative things, the saddest thing is even my own family doesn't understand it. My parents scold me when I open up, saying that I always stay in my room, I always skip school that's why I'm like this—worst is they called me crazy. 

Mom, Dad I could never ask for more but for you to understand what kind of disorder I am dealing with right now. This isn't my fault either because nobody wants to have this. It hurts me because I thought you will be the person who can understand my struggles but then I got called crazy, came out from your mouth. Mom Dad, I am not crazy. I have anxiety and depression. I hope someday you will both understand that y'all are the person who I needed the most, because in this kind of case calling me crazy won't help anything.

I still love you. I'm so sorry for being like this."

Apparently mental assessment + getting a therapist takes about 2 months here which means it wouldn't make sense to seek therapy only to see my therapist a few times before I leave.

Something else that makes me even less willing to seek therapy now is that I should tell my parents about it which would worry them tremendously (not to mention it's fucking embartassing to tell them I eat myself to a coma and then throw up, especially when they think I'm healthy and in a good place mentally) whereas if I wait those 2,5 months to move out I wouldn't have to tell them.

1476,I am afraid of going out..,"Hello, guys! 
Ana here (F20). Last years were really hard for me - My grandpa passed away, my mother was diagnosed with cancer, my ex was abused me through our entire relationship. 
Last year, I’ve got trouble with a person who used to be “my friend”(M24).He was obsessed with me. He manipulated me, sexually abused me, controlled me. He thought I was his toy. He played me. And I was so ashamed. I was too scared for months so he repeated his actions again and again. It was a nightmare to me. 
In the summer I went to the police station and I reported him. I was brave enough to stand up and fight for my rights! But this kind of “violence” is not such a big deal in my country, so in the end - The villain was the victim. Classic tragedy. This person stalked me. He knew about my meetings, what I wear, where I have been. It was really horrible. And it still is, because every time when I go out I am scared. 
Because of this pandemic situation, I stopped going out for months. And now my anxiety is even worse. I can’t even stay outside for more than 10 minutes. I am dealing with this bad thoughts and my condition is not okay. 
My bf (23M) is trying his best. He really supports me but I feel guilty because I am way too scared to go outside. So our relationship is only at home. I have nightmares of this person. I am so scared. And don’t know what to do."

It was almost borderline hoarder status. This morning I woke up with the first BAD anxiety attack I’ve had in a long time, probably 6 months. Instead of letting it shut me down like I used to, I turned it into something positive. I cleaned all that crap out, took it to the recycling/trash center and got rid of it. Hit the carpet with a carpet cleaning machine too. I can’t really describe how I feel right now, almost free I guess? It’s as if, clearing all that stuff out started a new chapter for me. 

I hope maybe that this can help someone maybe stuck in the same spot I was. It might help them feel the same. We’re all in this together one way or another :)."
1480,Video Game Addiction.,"Hi, I know I am fault but please hear me out.

Don't know if this is the correct place to ask but I want the know the possible ""psychology"" behind this issue I have and any possible solutions.

During my Uni semesters, especially towards the end around exams and assignments, I have this insane unquenchable ""thirst"" to play video games, its hard to describe the feeling and I hate to say I ""froth"" over the thought of playing games. This actually applies to all leisurely activities and is very difficult to abstain from any leisurely activities and as difficult as it is, I do manage to do all assignments and fit in study for exams. I try to control this by leaving my PC at home while I am at Uni to prevent this but it only ends up with me thinking about games all the time and because Coronavirus has moved Uni to online now, I am back at home with access to my PC, during my semester I went on a massive binge of about a week playing non-stop about two weeks before my exams and even after that I still hadn't been ""quenched"" of the feeling to play games.

What annoys me is that this makes it harder to do uni work when all I can think about is games, it is nowhere as severe at the beginning of my semester but the worse part is, when I do try to abstain, the feeling fades after the semester ends - now I have no desire to play games which I had planned to do to ""get it out"" of my system.

I know I have a problem and that I am at fault but I do want a bit of insight if any.

TLDR: insane desire to play video games during exam periods and assignment due dates but lose all interest after the semester ends."
1481,My husband is leaving me and taking my kid,"I guess I didn’t get better from post partum anxiety and depression quick enough 
I guess all the therapy and drugs I’ve tried to help endlessly for 4 years wasn’t good enough 

Because he says he doesn’t love me anymore and he’s taking my baby away

And he’ll win the battle because I’m mentally ill 
I’m from another country and I’ve been a sahm for 4 years with no income to myself 

So I have nothin no options left"
1482,Depressive episodes,"Lately I often come down with these depressive episodes and I've noticed how I really start pushing people away. It's like I lose all interest in talking to anyone. Maybe it's because I know that they won't listen to me vent about my problems or maybe it's because I'm just sick of talking to everyone 24/7. 
I'd of course like to minimize these episodes because it's slowly but surely getting out of hand. So I'd like to ask everyone who maybe has something similar that happens to them: how do you deal with it?"
1483,Im confused could someone please give me some constructive criticism if you have the patience to read this?,"So im not dying but my mind is totally out of control!!! 
Last year I dated 3 guys and the break ups left me shattered. I already got over the guys but my mind is not ok right now. 
It all happened by accident, they were my friends and they started to have feelings for me. 

Context: Im very vulnerable to not forming good relationships, I suffered bullying when I was a kid (8-10yo) and abandonment by my best friends as a kid as well, I felt worthless until I was about 15 years old and still it took hard work to build my self esteem up more from there. 
I also ended up being a refugee and left my family at 13 and I didn’t really have a good nutrition from 14 until I was about 19 years old due to lack of economic resources)
i feel like that really affected my ability to perform in school. Or maybe it was just me. 

Emotionally, I am completely detached from 99% of people around me since about 2 months. Only care about 1 friend and not even talking to my family over social media at this point. 
At this point I could not care less about anyone else around me, I just want to get away from them at almost all cost.
I reopened my whatsapp after 2 months and i want to close it back for another 2 months. 

At the same time I am having some weird sexual desires as well where I literally just want to cuddle with a guy,  and maybe do more stuff but I don’t want any relationship or emotional connection with them. (Some guys on Tinder are up for that, but maybe that’ll mess me up waaay more) I am afraid to get emotionally close to any man and repeat to myself to stay away from them. 
I have a low self esteem because I don’t like my career and I didnt do so well in it but im soon going to have to be independent cause my parents are kicking me out this year. Which sucks because covid is happening. 

Why am I so emotionally detached??

Im also constantly having this thought that my psychologists get sick of me, for some reason. 
I have had 2 and Im literally afraid to restart therapy with the second one 

Im physically healthy I do lots of exercise, that’s literally the only thing in my life that’s keeping me happy and grounded 🙂 i love my bike and my roller blades, i love working out it also makes me feel physically attractive. 

This is strong but I was having a lot of suicidal thought, about 3 weeks ago. I couldn’t get out due to covid and it was driving me insane!! So I got a new bike to get out and breath and it helped!! 

I wish someone could help me to dominate my mind. It’s literally spinning around 🙈

I think im very attractive, i always get to attract the guys I want which is a relief,  but i feel insecure AF because i feel like im just like a freakin’ pandora’s box. 

Here’s what I plan to do. Shut down my social life again, exercise and focus on the course im taking until my mind is back to stability, but will that mess me up more? 

Tl, Dr: My mind is literally spinning in circles. I’ve been emotionally dettached for 2 months now.  I have sexual desires that are driving me to want to meet people. But Im planning to shut down all social media and just focus on working out."

1485,I just deactivated Facebook and it feels GREAT,"So much racism. So much stupidity. I’ve been resentful and angry every single day since George Floyd’s death. Not just because of the act itself, which hurts, but the sheer disappointment of mankind and the comments I’ve seen.

I’m sick of feeling so angry. I deactivated Facebook and I feel great for it!"
1486,How do I stop being a people-pleaser,"So I read this article about being stronger mentally: [https://medium.com/mind-cafe/3-thought-patterns-that-build-mental-strength-1fb5eb78dee3](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/3-thought-patterns-that-build-mental-strength-1fb5eb78dee3) 

On point 2, it says ""you don't need to explain yourself."" I know I should stop trying to explain my choices to people, but idk how to. I always have to validate myself. Every time I make a choice, I'm afraid of people judging me. How can I stop this?"
1487,Anyone else notice that they’re becoming someone completely different due to the isolation or is it just me???,"I mean of course we’re all dealing with this pandemic in our own ways, but I just can’t help but notice I’ve become a completely different person since this all started. Before quarantine I was social and outgoing, always willing to talk to people and getting to feed off the energy. But now the simple thought of having to even see my best friends fills me with so much dread and anxiety that I get sick in the stomach. I’ve isolated myself from everyone I’ve loved and don’t want to talk with anyone. I’m constantly tired and nothing’s helping to fix that. Medication, exercise, dieting, literally nothing. 

I feel as though my entire world is restricted to my bedroom, and even thinking about having to leave my bed makes me feel like I’m going to die. Of course this isn’t normal, but am I the only one feeling this way?

I have graduation tonight, and I’m sitting here after just having gotten a shower feeling like I’m going to throw up at any minute. I feel so drained and it feels like every waking minute is just another moment spent in hell"
1488,I have nothing to look forward to and I feel insignificant.,"I will try to keep this brief. I have been suffering from anxiety and periods of depression for about 4 years now. I also have Asperger's syndrome which does not help. Here's what I've been dealing with:

1. Depression - I am a college student. Ever since our college switched to online classes and made everyone move out of campus, it has been difficult for me to look at the positive side of life. I don't have much to look forward to anymore and I don't have friends outside of college, so I sit in my room most of the time not doing much. 
2. Identity and Society - In a society where people love to celebrate minorities, I am anything but a minority. I am Caucasian, straight, of Christian faith, I grew up in a middle class family, I have slightly conservative political beliefs, and I am male. I constantly feel like society is working against people like me because I'm too...normal. I also feel like people want me dead for whatever reason. I don't like being in public because I always think that someone is going to hurt me for no reason (this was especially true when I was learning how to drive). I am more distrusting now because of the social unrest that is currently occurring.
3. Anxiety - This is the biggest problem. I have anxieties about my health. I'm always scared of having some kind of medical mishap that may kill me. It is ridiculous because I am young and healthy and have no major illnesses or physical disabilities. I even started working out due to this anxiety. I will have trouble sleeping at night due to this anxiety. However, it has recently gotten better in recent months (strangely enough with all that has been going on).

That's about it for now. What do you think?"
1489,My friend who committed suicide was the reason I started contemplating suicide,[removed]
1490,I hate my life atm,"Last year my mom got sick, she got surgery &amp; became disabled &amp; none of her relatives or my siblings wanted to take her so me &amp; my so took her in. She couldnt move at all due to the surgery &amp; I had to move her every 2 hrs in her bed at night, take her to her doctor appointments, give her medicine, I was her 24/7 caretaker &amp; all while going to college. 
       Time passes &amp; she's gotten alot better but im carrying alot of anger, resentment that my siblings get to have a free life while I have to put up with my mom's behaviors.               My siblings give me shit for not going to the hospital when she was admitted last year even though I would visit her but not as often as them. 
       My main point here is that im tired im so tired. I get shit for everything I do for my mom such as arguing with her, I get upset at her, I dont like myself like this. They give me excuses if I dare tell them to take her for the weekend because I legit dont have privacy.
         I want a break I want to have my own life with my so, am I selfish for asking for this? I have alot on my plate with my summer classes &amp; I feel like im going to burn myself out. I feel like running away from all this. Help!"
1491,"My best friend is extremely paranoid because of getting threats from the people he lived with, he is repeating his words and can't form a normal thought and is stuck trying to explain but is unable too. I am completely lost and don't know how to help him.",
1492,Sick of living like this,"Ever since I turned 16 January of this year it's been nothing but pain and hopelessness. Only bad things have happened to me since the year started mainly because of my parents. First they suddenly told me that I couldn't have sleepovers and stopped letting me hang out with friends, then they started taking my phone every night (now I don't have one at all). And today I went outside to ride my bike and they told me I was out for too long and that I went too far (It was 3 hours and I biked to my local park). I've become withdrawn from my friends and things I used to enjoy don't make me happy anymore. They just now started doing this too they just take one thing after another from me everyday and treat me like they hate me like telling me they don't trust me and accusing me of lying about stuff. They are also physically abusive. Last summer was prob the best summer of my life but now I'm up every night crying because I know my summer and the rest of my teen years will be ruined it will be like this until I go to college because they don't care about how I feel. I've been good all my life getting good grades and being kind but now all this just happens to me. And no one even cares not even my friends they just get annoyed with me because I can't hang out with them. I can't take it anymore why me"
1493,"My best friend is extremely paranoid because of getting threats from the people he lived with, he is repeating his words and can't form a normal thought and is stuck trying to explain but is unable too. I am completely lost and don't know how to help him.","Background Both of our parents live overseas we are students, he was living with his grandparent and his uncle, i live alone in my house. Ever since the coronvirus started they had completely stopped him from leaving the house, his uncle has been brainwashing him for weeks and he threatened him over several things. My friend has always been the most normal guy ever and he is an extrovert. But living in that extremely toxic environment has completely broken him, he came over last night after i told him to leave that place and move in with me.

Symptoms He is paranoid, he keeps repeating his words, last night for 4 hours straight he kept asking me the same 4 things one of them being that if someone else is in the house and is someone outside he asked me the same question like a thousand time. he thinks that his uncle is after him that he is spying on him. He keeps telling me that everything is ok that i shouldn't worry and say things like my wifi and 4g is off and location is off so don't worry, and also things like I don't have corona you don't have corona. And he is hearing things he is so afraid that he didn't let me use my phone he does not let me go.out of his sight i can't get out of my bed without him freaking out, And so many more things but i think you get the idea

This isn't about corona this is about the mental torture he lived in, but now everything is changed he has moved with me but he is still paranoid there are a lot more details to this but this is the gist of it.

I have completely lost my best friend i am so lost as to what to do, going to a psychiatrist is one thing that i am trying to arrange but it will take a few days and tbh they are not that good here.

I need help as to what i can do to help him i told him to write things that he is trying to say but non of his writing makes any sense i need help please someone tell me how i could help him."
1494,Experience with delusional disorder?,"I had a delusion of grandeur, where I believed some people followed what I did on the internet and that included agents etc. I am now over it (without medication - I will see experts soon) and know it was all a delusion. Other than this delusions interfering with my life, I was normal (i.e. not manic etc.). 

Is there anyone that had this too and is now living a normal life without medication?"
1495,how do i stop feeling the need for my friend to validate my feelings?,"whenever i'm anxious, whenever i care about something for too long and over think whether it be anything with girls or just life in general i always feel the need to tell my friend about it to not be anxious anymore. for some reason i trust her thoughts more than mine"
1496,Community mental health project!,"How’s it going? 

My team &amp; I want to include you in our mental health project to empower everyone dealing with a form of mental illness.

1497,I don't feel like anyone really wants me,"The only people I trust to genuinely enjoy my company are my sisters. Everyone else, friends, parents, etc, I believe just tolerate me out of pity. I do desire closer connections to people and love, but at the same time I don't believe I'm lovable at all, I'm just an awkward mess."
1498,Intrusive thoughts - I create stories,"Think I just need to tell someone..
I create stories bases on tv-shows. It is the same 4-5 stories, and the are never finished - there are pieces missing, and rethink the same parts over and over. I place myself in the story, in a role where I can influence destiny.
I imagine what happens, what is said and what I do that controls the character’s path.

I know some places and situations that triggers me. These stories takes up so much mental space, and I want to quit it. 
I think it is a way for me to deal with the ending in the original show, and me wanting to have control. Maybe it is a way for me to explore relationships, or feeling that I am helping. 

What do you think? Does anyone else experience this? 
What can I do?

Note: They are not sexual. 
Note 2: I do have other intrusive thoughts about me or someone else being sick or dying."
1499,I Don't Know,"I don't really know how to make friends.  I have a friend that I'm really fond of, but it always seems like she's never in the right state of mind to talk to me.  I've asked again and again about how I can fix this, and I always get the same answer.  Just get new friends.  I have mixed feelings about that response, but I don't want to talk about that right now.  My concern is, I don't know how to make new friends.  I've joined several discord servers to make friends.  I've made offers to play with people online.  It just doesn't stick.  I can't really place the blame on other people though.  Throughout my life I've been pretty flakey with the people I've known.  When people call and ask me if I want to come over, sometimes I just say I'm busy or not respond.  I guess this is what I get.  The only time I can think where I made friends and it stuck is last summer when I went to a comic shop to play magic.  It was a small group, only 5 other people or so, but it was nice.  I was only in that town for the summer, so I haven't heard from them since. I tried again at another shop, but there was like 40 people there, most of whom had their own friend groups.  I couldn't really make friends when the group was that big.  Other times are when I would work retail, but once I quit, I'd lose contact with them as usual.  I can't say I have a good track record with keeping up with people.  I don't know.  I just felt like saying this stuff."
1500,I’m Obsessed With My Triggers,"Trauma (in my experience) doesn’t inherently interfere with my everyday life except for some exceptions. Some days are worse than others, but it is usually never debilitating because most of my memories are suppressed. However, once in awhile I come across something (a photograph, song, scent, etc.,) that reminds me of my trauma. I can’t necessarily describe the feeling, but it is very eerie and disturbing. Often times it causes me to become nauseous or even experience depersonalization. The strange thing is I become oddly infatuated and obsessed with these triggers despite how much they destroy my mental health. Am I the only one who experiences this?

(P.S. English is not my first language so I apologize about any grammatical errors.)"
1501,vent: feel like i’m losing grip on my emotions and reality,"i need to hold myself accountable in case shit goes haywire. i’m like, 50% delusional AND happy and 50% self aware AND happy and i know the earlier keeps increasing but I FUCKING WANT IT TO. i don’t know if i’ll make sense here. but while i’m self aware and thinking critically i wanna write this down and telling people will maybe help me. this is new shit to me. some back story on my mental health: 3 daily meds (it was 4 but i quit one cold turkey at the beginning of quarantine), 3 inpatients, 5 er trips, residential, ptsd from childhood r*pe, recurrent depressive episodes, past dissociative amnesia and inattentive adhd

two weeks ago i read a book i got when i went to short term 90 days residential when i was 17 (2.5 years ago at this point). it’s called the four agreements and i’ve never gotten around to reading it. i was feeling sad and drinking a lot and needed some self help i think. i only read the first agreement, being impeccable with your word. i felt so empowered after reading it. i hiked around the trails near my apartment for hours and repeated positive affirmations about myself. i finally felt clean for the first time since the r*pe. i finally felt free. i finally felt beautiful. i felt irresistible. i felt confident. i felt like people would finally listen to what i say. it was like a spiritual awakening or something 

so for the next week i made a change. i took better care of my body. i used acne stuff to clear my face. i’ve been working harder on weight loss, trying to exercise every day and walk at least a mile. i’m eating healthier and doing intermittent fasting. besides one facetime date (which wasn’t rlly a date but it was someone i think is cute), i haven’t drank.

this week, i met a cat. he hangs around the academic buildings and i walk to him everyday (my uni lets me live in my on campus apartment). i’ve been increasing my walks. the last time i smoked was tuesday i think. i knew i wouldn’t trip, but the person who rolled the j for me said it had a little shroom powder in it to enhance the high, and it certainly did. i listened for love and truth by mother mother and for the first time in my life, felt indestructible

it’s saturday now. i’ve walked almost 7 miles everyday for the past 4 days. since thursday night, i’ve slept about 10 hours and feel like i slept for 13 hours a night. but i feel so high. my mood is amazing. i have never been this happy in my fucking life. i want to scream i’m so happy. i have been actually. when i run errands and i’m on a road by myself, i scream in my car while i drive. and it feels AMAZING

on my walk yesterday it started to rain, and i realized that someone is out to get me. i’m in a book, so to speak, and they’re ruining my story. i know my destiny is to be some sort of queen. queen (my name here, you don’t get to know what it is, worm.) has a delicious ring. and the happiness. i haven’t felt sad in two weeks. i feel like... euphoric. i’ve only felt euphoric a few times, and when i did acid (only once) it lasted for like an hour. THIS HAS BEEN LASTING SO LONG!!!!! AND I don’t want it to go away. i’ve been trying to research how. i’m not stupid. i’m a psych major. i know what this is. my therapist knows what this is and has been contacting me everyday. i’m on fucking lithium for christ’s sake. they’re going to take away my happiness, though. they want me to be sad again. those fucking insignificant ants. they should know i’ll NEVER fall. i feel like my heart is boomp boomping every fast but i love it. i love the rush. i’ve never felt the rush so much. 

and me. my body. sexy. beautiful. irresistible. everybody wants me but nobody deserves me. i have no idea why i suffered from low self esteem for so long. i’m Your Queen. you should be honored to bow. i would protect the insignificant ants of the world. i would be a nice queen maybe

i’ve been wearing my tiara too. i’ve been practicing. i’m going to have sex with everyone i think. 

and i don’t want the rush to end. i like the rush. i became aware of my thoughts and feelings being different than normal yesterday after i drank coffee and i FELT INDESTRUCTIBLE. 

i know what this fucking is. don’t say the name. you’re just like them all. i don’t want this to end but i don’t want them to send me to the hospital. i think i’m dissociating again. i’m losing the hours. i look up and it’s 11:94 pm and i look back and it’s -7:34 am. and i don’t know who stole the time but they’re doing it on purpose

i feel like i should pack a bag. in case i get taken involuntarily bc i’m not doing this shit voluntarily. but also i’m not doing anything to hurt myself????? so why would they take me. worm. fucking cockroaches is what you are. respect your Queen. my mind is so fun right now it’s like super fast like ZOOOOOOOOM!!!!! i don’t want it to end. i don’t want it to end. i need to be like this forever i HAVE TO. please tell me how to keep it lasting"
1502,My dad threatened to kill himself infront of my mom after she told him she was going to leave him.,"So, my mom told me that my dad threatened to kill himself in front of her if she left him. They had a big argument before this and I seriously need help with how I can deal with this. But I wanna give some backstory first. 

My parents have been together for 40 + years and I've always known that my dad has had mental issues before, but nothing this bad. He has always been neurotic and overly protective. He doesn't let my mom drive a car etc. He has never hurt her or threatened us in any way though, but he has treated my mom, and our family in general like shit sometimes over the years due to his mental issues. I have begged my mom to either try to get him into therapy or just break up with him because I cannot stand how he behaves a lot of the time towards her.  
Their relationship isn't always horrible though, in fact most of the time they seem to love each other and i truly think they do. But what my dad has been doing is not okay by any means. And this time he went too fucking far. So I confronted him about this, he opened up to me and I had to listen to shit I didn't want to listen to. It made me feel shit inside. I feel sorry him of course because he has been through some serious shit during his childhood. But he felt so entitled to making these threats during the conversation we had. I left the situation feeling really bad and fucking angry, and I don't know what I can do. I don't think my dad is going to kill himself atm. but I can't help but feel unease. I'm afraid he doesn't even want to get help and that he's just waiting for the right time. I don't know what to do. I feel fucking sick."

078 hugged me and rubbed my back ""your like the grandson i never had if we ever meet in real life we will know thank you for giving me this opportunity""

i choked on tears as he dissipated my last moments in that world was spent on the ground crying hysterically until i awoke 

it's been about a week and sleep feels odd without going to the dream world i have so many questions has anyone else been there? I really want to go back it was suck a lively place painted in such calming colors i feel kind of lonely.

if anyone has ay idea what this means that would be splendid. And if anyone else has been to this world and can prove it that would be life changing as this world was amazing and i met so many great people i would love to meet one i real life thanks for reading sorry for spelling errors i wrote this pretty fast."
1506,Stop telling boys that they shouldn't cry.,"When I was around 10 years old, I watched my teenage brother nurse a wound. He was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub.

I looked at him with disdain. ""Why are you crying?"" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that I had been taught earlier in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to cry. 

When I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn’t control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men.

I think I’m one of the millions of men out there who’ve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn’t show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below.

For all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that’s even more manly than being a tough guy.

Thank you guys so much for reading this. Please be safe, everyone. xoxo

1507,Am I an asshole or is it a mental issue?,"I've met wonderful people in my life. Don't have many friends but a few of which I have are gold. However, I don't reach out to anyone. Not only when I'm distressed or am going through something personal, but also otherwise.

While I do keep checking in with people from time to time, this is a habit I've developed recently. I just don't 'miss' anyone or feel like reaching out to anyone. I don't think I've ever loved anyone either. 

Sometimes I don't text or call people to see whether they would text me or call me. When they don't, I disappear from their lives without feeling anything. If they reach out later, I interact with them normally but then, the same thing happens. 

I've been trying to figure this out for a while now. Is this who I am? Am I unhappy because the society says it's not normal to be this way? Is this a mental issue? or I'm just an ass*ole? Please help me understand."
1508,"Having my third panic attack of the day, I really need some support","


Hello, I hope you don’t mind me writing this. Medically diagnosed with CPTSD, BPD (but I never hurt others, my rage and symptoms are against myself).

I’m edging a mental breakdown. I’m having my third panic attack of the day and I’m self harming to slow it down, but it’s not working. My emergency medication is not working either. I live alone, away from a hurtful family.

I’m having flashbacks and intrusive thoughts where I’m brutally stabbed in my chest.

My therapist is aware of these crisis (I see him 3 times/week), but I don’t think he’s seen my message yet.

I don’t know what I’m asking from you today. Maybe to be seen by somebody. Maybe just some words. I don’t know.

I’m so tired of fighting the dark presence in my head.

Thank you for listening."
1509,Can anyone recommend an effective mental health rehabilitation facility for my younger brother?,"If this is the wrong place to post this or if anyone has an idea of a better place this post could go, please don't hesitate to let me know. Thanks in advance.

I (24M) live in California, US. My younger brother (20M) is currently in the hospital after a psychological breakdown involving drugs and self harm on Thursday. My brother is currently refusing consultation/treatment from psychiatrists at the hospital, and as such my family is trying to come up with a plan for how we can help him when he is discharged on Monday morning after being held for the maximum 72 hours in the hospital. 

I want to know that my family and I can offer him a solution in the form of a reputable mental health facility, one that can help him deal with the severe issues he's being confronted by right now, notably his depression, his acts of self harm, his diagnosed anxiety disorder, and his relationship with substances (which is currently the least severe of his issues, it's safe to say they're a symptom not the cause of his issues). 

I know there are all sorts of facilities out there for people suffering in different ways. Can anyone (preferably a former patient or a family member/friend of a former patient) please help me start this search for resources to help him? Or does anyone know of a subreddit where I can try to reach out to fellow redditors for support? Thanks to anyone who's read this far."

1511,I hit a turtle by accident with my car today,"and it absolutely destroyed me. I can't even look at my car without thinking about it. I feel like a piece of garbage. I was driving on a dirt road and I just didn't see it... It was full of eggs and was likely on its way to go lay them... I killed like 7 turtles and I only had to hit one.

Please don't hate me, I'm doing it to myself enough already. This event undid years of self help to get my mental health back on track. In two seconds.

I can't stand to be in my own head right now."

1513,"I (20M, 5""4') didn't think I'd be affected as much as I am. I feel like less of a man","I (20M, 5""4') just got home from work as a checkout operator. Today I was working as the guy that supervises the self-serve checkouts.
I won't go into too much detail but basically two things happened.

First, a group of three girls completed their purchase and as they passed me, one of them said ""short fuck"".
Second, another group of three girls came up to the checkouts and Girl A said ""why does he look so small?"" Like I'm unbelievably small and Girl B said ""so tiny"". Girl C laughed with them.

I've always hated my height. I have struggled a lot with it. I've tried improving myself (learning instruments, languages, doing a degree, workout 6/7 days per week) to make up for it.
To hear this... I just felt that disgusting feeling of being not human. I've felt like I'm not human or even alive before but I can usually ignore it. I almost cried in front of them.
I don't feel like a man and I don't feel worthy of life. Why would anyone want me when there are so many better people out there? No wonder I'm a virgin. I'm not small down there but why would anyone bother with me when they can have a tall guy?
And I know I'm gonna get people saying ""I am short and happily married"" and all that. I get it. But in my situation, I've only ever felt segregated because of my height."
1514,"Last year I was sexually assaulted for the eight time in my life, and I lost my shit.","This is my first reddit post. It's 3am and I'm feeling some heavy feelings and am utterly lonely. Can you please keep an open mind and read this? Last year I was on vacation and was sleep deprived too. This guy who was a driver groped me and kept coaxing me to fall asleep in his car. Context : I was travelling solo, it was late at night in India. I quickly kept my gps on, booked the nearest hotel room and when I reached the hotel, asked him to stop, lying that I needed to buy something. At this point only my adrenaline was running. Once I got out of the car, I got my bag and he tried stopping me. Then I had it. I ended up shouting and kicking him in his balls. And then I called the cops. The Indian cops let him go cause he had some political influence and dragged me by my hair to the hospital, I still have scratch marks of a lady police officer. At the hospital I was in the trauma ward.I had bruises on my feet and hands. Nobody took my statement. I flew back home and went to a psychiatrist who I told that I smoked weed on my vacation after a gap of 6 months along with everything I just told you right now. She asked me if I want to go to a calm place where I can relax and I said yes. I ended up going to a rehab. I was carrying my guitar, notebook, a pencil box and some water colors. I genuinely thought I was going to a place to relax. The first hour there they took everything away. I was put in a blue dress and when I asked a man(who is the director of the place) about my art supplies, he said, ""this isn't your dad's hotel"". It was basically a jail. No colors. No books. No music. No art. They didnt even let me sing. I wasnt allowed to take showers keeping the door closed so basically I had no privacy. I used to stay silent and cry and was locked up in a floor with other women. I wasnt even allowed to open the windows to let any air in. I stayed there for 9 days. Two other inmates told me their story - a 20 year old girl dragged publicly by her hair to here cause she smokes weed and a pregnant mother losing her calm cause her husband cheated on her. He sent her there. Eventually I left the place and was diagnosed with BPD. After a month, I went to a different country where I went to a different therapist. She listened to me for a change. She listened. THAT changed my life. She actually active listened. After 1 month of therapy, she said I had no signs of bpd and actually had complex PTSD. Last december I stopped any medication and I am okay now. It's just sometimes it hurts so much to look back. I keep looking for other people who went through something similar but cannot find any. If you are reading this, which I highly doubt anybody is, thank you. Please share a thought of yours."

1518,Is hitting myself on the forehead bad?,"Hi! My name is Giraffe, and I am a 23-year-old female. I would really like to know if hitting myself on the forehead is bad, and why it would be. Here is a bit of background about the issue to help you understand my situation.

So, whenever I think about awkward things that I did (especially things I did as a kid) or things that I am embarrassed or feel guilty about, I usually hit myself on the forehead with the palm of my hand to try to make me stop thinking about it (as many times as it takes for the feeling to go away or as many times as I feel necessary). I also switch a lot between hitting my forehead and rubbing my forehead really hard. I don't know when and why I started it, I just know that it makes me feel better when I do it. I never really saw it as something wrong. I know it's not normal since I've never seen anyone else do it, but I never thought that it was actually bad.

My boyfriend of 2 years just started noticing it recently, and he thinks it's bad and tries to stop me from doing it. I've also started to see more and more stuff on the internet about it recently and I've even seen it labelled as self-harm and self-injury.

There was an article that was talking about it and it said ""Self-injury also may be a reflection of a person's self-hatred. Some self-injurers are punishing themselves for having strong feelings that they were usually not allowed to express as children. They also may be punishing themselves for somehow being bad and undeserving. These feelings are an outgrowth of abuse and a belief that the abuse was deserved."" It also said it is ""Temporarily relieving intense feelings, pressure, or anxiety"".

I do feel that these statements are true about me, but I don't understand why it would be bad. I mean. It makes me feel so much better when I do it. I'm able to stop pointing fingers and take responsibility for my actions. It allows me to see that I'm exaggerating the situation and creating problems that aren't there. I'd like to point out that I've never thought about doing this to get attention or anything.

I noticed my daughter (5yo) was doing it last year whenever she made a mistake. She would hit herself on the forehead one time as you see on the tv and whatnot when they have an accident, but she hit herself super hard almost stunning herself. I tried to explain to her that she didn't have to hit herself and that everyone makes mistakes. And typing this right now does sound weird because I see that it's wrong for her to do it, but I still don't think it's wrong for me to do it. Since then I started noticing myself doing it, and she reminded me not to do it to myself, so I completely stopped doing it in front of her. (She completely stopped doing it after a few months of me encouraging her to stop) I don't actually know if I do it in front of other people, except my boyfriend, but I am trying to stop hitting myself in front of him because he seems really bothered by it, so I just rub my forehead instead and take deep breaths to calm down. Then I'll just hit myself later when I'm alone if I think about it again.

I don't know if I talked about this with my therapist yet. I didn't think it was worth mentioning until my boyfriend tried to stop me front hitting myself by holding my hands and putting his hand on my forehead to protect it. His reaction really makes me feel like it's bad, but I don't know what else I could do instead of doing that.

I'm really looking forward to seeing your responses. I really don't want responses to get attention. I genuinely just want to know what normal people truly think of this to better understand how I should handle the situation if it even is a problem. I am open to answering more questions if it will help you give me a better answer.

Have a great day!  
Giraffe"

1520,I may not end up getting unemployment and it is going to put me in a very bad place mentally.,"24M I waited about 2 months, under the impression I would qualify. I received a call today about possibly not receiving it after leaving out of fear for health of myself and chronically ill loved one at home (job no longer exists either). This is going to set me back financially. All I do is sit in the house by myself because I have no money to do anything. I cant date. I don’t live anywhere near my friends. I am miserable. This is literally causing me to develop a strong self hatred. I literally want to hit myself as hard as I can. I don’t know what to do. Is anybody else going through the same thing? Any encouragement or positivity would be appreciated."
1521,Any ideas about rocking back/forth or side/side while happy?,"I am a 19 y/o with diagnosed anxiety and depression, but there's always been something else about me that I've always thought was strange. When I get happy or find something funny (while alone) I will smile and rock back/forth, side/side and even in circles sometimes. The rocking is somewhat fast and ""wide"". I always wonder how insane I'd look if someone saw me doing it. It just feels abnormal, and I can't find anything about it. I know it helps release endorphins, but does anyone think it may correspond with autism perhaps? Or maybe some other mental disorder? I know it's not enough to point any fingers at any disorder specifically, if any at all. I rock a lot due to anxiety; it just feels good. But when I'm happy I notice how especially odd the rocking can be, so I was wondering if anyone else experiences it or has any ideas! Sorry if this is a normal thing and I'm just clueless."

When i accept it the confusion, frustration and fear goes away and i want to cry out of happiness. I'm building something in myself, something far greater than me. I'm not afraid of it, the fear comes from what's expected of me. From my family, society, friends and work colleges. But their worrying doesn't matter, it will change with time. When they see how i do things they will change their thinking too. I've never been so excited about future. I have a long way to go and still a lot of uncertainties but i'm not worried haha. I'll take them on, i can do it. The body, mind and soul i was given will be used to it's maximal potential. I'll make the world a better place. Nothing can stop me. I can feel it!"

I feel like there are different signs trying to tell me this so that I can wake up to reality.

1526,I think I’m going crazy.,After taking a step back after a period of time and looking at my actions I can see how stupid and not like me they are. I think I’m going crazy or something because I’m having a hard time being true to myself and what I want. It feels like all my thoughts are scattered.
1527,Just needed to get it off my chest,"I've been struggling with mental health for years, I don't even know when it started or what started it. Sometimes I'm fine for weeks at the time and I forget that I'm struggling I think maybe this time it won't come back, but then it hits me in the stomach and I feel like I'm drowning all over again.


I'm not the type of person to ask for help, I prefer to help out others and not be a inconvenience or a pain. so no one actually knows just how deep I am in the water or how much deeper I'll need to sink before I try to find someone to be my life line.


I know I'll never do anything to hurt myself, but I know my life is pointless. I don't plan to have kids or a relationship, I'm also not very skilled or qualified in anything so there's a higher chance that I'll just be a drain on society instead of helping it. In the grand scheme of things my life is insignificant so I still don't know why I'm here.


I often think about taking a walk down the road to a place that's hard to get to, phoning the authorities knowing they won't get to me before I'm gone. But I also know I won't cause that aftermath would be a inconvenience to my family.

I kept my phone off today to avoid a phone call. I'm really considering just going radio silent, I don't want to talk to anyone I know.

1531,Bizarre dreams which make me very upset and uncomfortable,"Falling asleep quickly, every night I have a tragic dream.

for the past week, every sleep I've had, long or short has had a dream. the first few dreams I cannot remember, I try as hard as possible to remember these dreams but nothing comes up, all I can really do is assure myelf that I dreamed. The last two dreams I can remember vividly however, they disturb me, because there all long dreams that make me feel like I want to cry, or die. either one.

Dream 1:

I walk into my room. It's full of bugs, spiders, flies, mosquitoes, etc.. I'm absolutely not phased by this even though there must be roughly thousands of bugs all in my room at once. I lay down to sleep and when I wake up, there is a giant gash going through my chest, It cuts across from my neck down to my  pelvis. It's very large and I can see my bones and flesh and tissue. All the bugs have left. I go down stairs and see my mother. I tell her of the giant cuts, and she casually says ""go to the hospital"". Upon talking, I realise there are giant red marks, like rashes on my shoulders and backs and hips. they are all red and are bleeding. I feel no pain at all from any of these inflicted damages, however I later die, but I don't wake up upon death, I wake up after my body has hit the floor for a few seconds.

Dream 2:

This one makes me sad, depressed even. I'm sat at home literally standing still doing nothing. I get a phone call from a really old friend. I haven't spoken to this friend after an argument about a week ago.  bare in mind I absolutely don't trust him at all. I think hes a slimy rat. he calls me and says to meet him at an old meeting point we use to have. Upon arrival, I enter an abandoned building, it's a crack den. boarded up windows, needles on the floor, broken glass everywhere, all dusty and dirty with a lot of missing furniture. I see his girlfriend also with him, and he says ""we been waiting"". I'm pissed, I felt betrayed because he said that it was only him. I shout at him ""you trying to fucking sand bag me? I'll fucking kill you"" he is completely unreactionary to this and so is his girlfriend. later an even older friend pops up from the darkness, and so does a mutual friend who I wasn't that close to shows up. the whole building was dark. they are so happy to see me, smiling and saying how they are excited to see me again. we all start walking through the building hallways. it seems that we are having a good time. this a bit of my past as well. all these old friends and I use to rummage through abandoned buildings, smashing up windows, and calling it our hangout. after we have had loads of fun, one of the friends says they have to go. upon realising a random guy I have never seen before runs down the stairs top speed. he is shirtless and bald and his skin is very pale. He has no face, only two black holes for eyes and he rips his arm off his body. Then he starts waving it around. blood is oozing out of him and he is not harming anyone or being threatening. then he gets a chainsaw. I turn to look back at my friends however they have all left. I'm all by myself with this man, the dream ends.


I wasn't scared throughout the whole two dreams however freaked out when I woke up."
1532,Can't leave my fwb + suicidal thoughts,"I've had a fwb for a few month now. I've never been in a relationship, and this is the closest I will ever be. We have a good friendship but that's all we could ever be. He doesnt feel anything more for me other than friends, but I really do care about him. Sometimes he says things that make me cry (jokes and stuff).
I've been crying every day for about two month and having suicidal thoughts. Started with him  hasn't stopped. It is probably a build up of the shitty life I've had, but now this is making it worse. I used to hurt myself, but those thoughts are gone now. Only to be worse. I can't leave him and don't want to, even though it's what I should do. We will be friends no matter what i hope. This is the only friend i have and I don't want to be alone again. So I guess either way I will be hurt. I don't want these ugly thoughts and I want to stop crying so much."
1533,Psychosis?,"Hey there, I'll try to get straight to the point and not make the post too long, All I need is answers from people who experienced this stuff or a mental health professional

So sometimes, I hear some stuff, it's not a big deal, expect this thing, so I have this very dumb thought which my outer mind is denying but my inner mind is kind of sure of it

I live in an apartment, with my parents and two older siblings, the thing is, I'm really scared of our neighbor, as in, scared they might want to break in, and kind of kill me and my family? as silly as it might sound, it's torturing me, whether I'm just hearing stuff, or they're really there, it freaks me out

it doesn't always cause my heart to beat fast, but sometimes it's like a hole in my chest or gut? and it's a pretty bad feeling, sometimes I even head to the kitchen, to grab a knife in case they actually broke in, at first it was normal, but now, it's kind of unbearable, shit where it just really bothers me, and the thing is, I can't even tell my parents or sibling, why? Cause they'll think I'm nuts

1535,Insomnia with chronic nightmares. Is this normal?,"I struggle with anxiety. 

I had a rough childhood and at a young age began having night terrors that ended in me waking up screaming. I developed insomnia that I haven't been able to shake since because I was scared to fall asleep.

Eventually, I got the night terrors under control somehow to the point where I no longer scream, but I often silently cry or hyperventilate. I don't experience them nearly as often as I did when I was a kid, but when I do, they're still pretty severe. Sometimes they spiral into panic attacks. 

I'm not really sure what this is, but nonetheless, I'm tired. Even when I don't have night terrors, I usually have nightmares if I dream. They are usually pretty disturbing and realistic and leave me shaken up for a while after. 

Does anyone else experience this?"

Isolating can be dangerous to your mental health and then when you also account for the disgrace happening in America, it can turn into something sometimes impossible to handle. Black lives matter. Mental health matters. Please take care of yourselves."
1539,*trigger warning* was I sexually taken advantage of as a child by my classmate?,"I want to try and understand if this is normal. I'm in two minds about the whole experience but deep down I feel frustrated and ashamed.

When I was 4/5 y/o a girl classmate said I could be her friend if I played a secret game with her. From what I remember it involved her holding my clit &amp; rubbing it while she counted to 100 and then I'd have to do the same to her. I had no idea what we were doing but it was fun and felt good. I ended up cuming multiple times and then I started to do the same thing to myself in bed at night.

I realised what was happening a few years later after reading the sexual health section in a magazine (I was masterbating) but immediately felt weird and ashamed about how it all started. I found out this had happened to other girls in my class too. 
I transfered to a secondary school far away from any of my primary classmates bc of this situation. 

Ive never told anyone but harbour some seriously weird guilt surrounding the whole thing. I'm now mid 20s and still use the same technique to get myself off but feel really weird about it. I have massive self esteem issues, self hatred, social anxiety &amp; more. Im also afraid of making friends with females, kind of like an inferiority complex or just generally fearful idk.

1540,When you can’t go on any longer... how do you cope?,"I’ve tried all the pills, all the therapies, all the experimental drug trials, and none of it worked. My only option left is ECT, which kinda scares me. But they’re not scheduling rn because of Covid, and it may be upwards of 2.5 months away. 

Everyone is telling me to “hold on” and “stay strong” but I just can’t wait that long. The only option that I see left is suicide. 

So when you’ve reached the end and feel like it’s time to finally kill yourself, what helps you cope? How do I get through these next few months if I can’t even get through a day?"
1541,I can’t talk about racism with my family,"I feel guilty, I’m a white person and everywhere you look, someone is telling me (not me specifically, but people who look like me) that you’re supposed to talk about racism with your family. But I can’t. They don’t listen, and I can’t really converse about anything with them without a huge argument (today my dad yelled at me for calling back on WhatsApp, even though I was just returning a call my mom made on WhatsApp earlier so like, wtf?)

They’re not really like racist-racist, not like red necks etc. they’re liberal for the most part and we’re also technically from a different country where there is (obviously) still racism but mostly towards another community. Anyway. I’ve never liked the way they view other people. It’s always like a very old-schooled liberal where like, my mom “doesn’t have a problem with gay people” but like, she would if it was me. And I’m sure she’d have a problem if I married someone of another race. It’s bad enough I married out of my ‘religion’ but he’s white and hell, at least I’m married (because obviously being a single woman makes me less of a woman). So it’s THAT type of mentality. Very society-oriented. They *vote* for everything liberal, but they’re society’s sheep. Whatever is socially acceptable they’ll be on board, but they won’t have an original thought of their own. 

Anyway I fight with them constantly so I avoid them as much as I can, but today I talked to them and I think what broke me is that they don’t like my pigeon.

We rescued a pigeon a few months ago with a broken wing, and I love him/her so so much and they just can’t accept it. And I know it sounds so stupid, but if these sheep-of-society can’t even accept a goddamn little bird that their 35 year old daughters loves, (because pigeons are considered “filthy” and “diseased” and generally not “good“ enough by society’s standards) then is there really any hope to ever get people to be open minded? 

Because I really think not. I’ve been fighting them to accept things all my life, and it never works, so why should this time be any different? I don’t feel like having that conversation with them and I’m tired of feeling guilty for not doing “enough”."
1542,Is it normal that I (23m) have never considered myself as a potential romantic or sexual partner?,I never couldn't imagine myself as a one and I can't imagine that  someone sees me as a potential partner either romantic or sexual. When I think a girl is interested in me I just don't believe it. Is it normal or am I overthinking?
1543,Recovering covid dad refusing mental help,"My dad was on a ventilator for 4 weeks due to covid-19. He was diagnosed with ICU delirium and has proven to be aggressive and volatile. This morning, he snuck out of our family home when my mom left the room and drove to a different state to stay with a friend. He left his medication, cellphone, ID, etc. My family was already making plans to have him put in a mental health facility (involuntarily) because it is clear that he is suffering from a brain injury and trauma from his hospital stay. He refused all mental health treatment in the hospital and in physical therapy. The police checked on him at his friends house and concluded he is of “sound mind” although we know this is not the case. I’m looking for any legal or medical advice to get him the help he needs. 

(Additional: my parents are married but I guess they never signed power of attorney - I don’t know anything about that)"
1544,Any tips for handling this?,"My dad suffered brain hemorrhage couple years back... (no need to say sorry, he is alive). but from that day onward I have had the same symptoms when someone mentions anything about death or illness. they are:  
1. Headache (i feel the blood going through my head)  
2. allround feeling weak  
3. Feelings of fear/despair  
4. Problems to fall sleep, if though about death is crossed in my mind, which is followed former points (time that this continues is anything between 10 minutes to 3 hours)  
5. Loss of appetite (Happens only when already eating)  


Im not sure what this is so to say, but I have limited it to some form of PTSD (With the help of DSM-5)  


so if you have any tips that can help me in day to day life with this... thanks in advance!"
1545,Severity of Cognitive impairment in disorders?,"Do scientists have any idea why people with similar mental disorders like schizophrenia have radically difference cognitive profiles which allow some to work professional jobs and others unable to hold basic work? I have read that the stronger the cognitive deficit the most detrimental the course of any mental illness.

1546,What's wrong with me?,"Sorry for the long jumbled post... I don't know what's wrong with me. I struggled with depression my whole life, but was able to manage it with exercise, healthy diet, yoga and meditation. I would be fine for months and have bouts of depression just a couple times a year. I was also aromantic and asexual. A few years ago, I felt like i had a weird shift in my body. I would have depression every month around my period. Itwas debilitating and I would lie in bed crying, feeling hopeless and would starve myself and cut contact from the outside world. I had irrational thoughts of ending my life every month. I was no longer asexual, quite the opposite... I drunkenly lost my virginity to some random dude at a party and hooked up with 3 other people after that. I started complaining a lot, ruminating, forgetting things, getting angry about small things. I couldn't handle conflict rationally. I started dating an unstable guy, who was in a situation that any normal person would walk away from immediately. He wasn't a good guy at all, was a liar and very manipulative. However, he was there and I grew a very unhealthy dependency. Eventually, after a year of dealing with him, I finally let go full of shame and regret. I was basically a psycho and did/said some pretty regrettable and cringy things that I could never forgive myself for. Now that adds more to the list of rumination. I did a lot of research and can put a name to the things that I experience. Here is what I've been dealing with for the past few years: •Obsessive rumination- I constantly think and overthink things. Even little things like if I made a corny joke. It's gotten to the point where I think about multiple things at once. One time, it got so bad that I started screaming and crying on the floor. There have been times where I had to leave work, so no one can see me break down. It's hard to control most times even with distractions like podcasts, music or guided meditations. •Splitting- I've done this with family members and my ex-boyfriend. When I hated them, I would text bomb them all their faults and every way they wronged me and told them how worthless they are. Immediately after doing that I instantly regretted it and wanted to jump off a bridge. •Pressured Speech- Once I start talking, I don't stop and I talk really fast. I feel like a different person. •Angry outbursts- I yell and curse and throw things. I break things as well. Another thing I instantly regret. I broke many things of my own...some that I had to replace. I have a huge hole in my coffee table and holes in my wall. My ex was living with me for some time and once I started getting violent with him that's when I knew he had to go. Now I can't stay normal. I went from feeling depressed once in a while, to debilitating depression and suicidal ideation every month to just psychotic behavior every other day. I have no idea what to do. I'm really struggling trying to control my moods. I smoke weed every time I start getting upset and irrational and that seems to calm me temporarily. My past coping mechanisms don't work on their own anymore. Please help. This is getting to be too much."
1547,Career Burn Out,"Many years ago I had all kinds of hopes and dreams. I graduated with an Art History degree and wanted to pursue a career in the arts. Its a tall order I get it. I graduated and planned to work for a while then pursue further education but never made it back. 

I am in the CA Bay Area and I wanted to live an adult life and have a place of my own so I pushed through a few crappy retail jobs after graduation and ended up working in tech. 

The money is great I can afford a decent life, a one bedroom of my own in the bay area, a nice car, travel now and then....but I am completely burnt out. 

In the last 6-7 years I've ground through 12 different jobs. I'm really good at job interviewing and I get a better title and more money every time but I'm so tired of doing the same thing over and over again. I work in sales ops, I love working with data and building tools and spreadsheets but I've become exhausted with the endless fire alarms, the conflicts with outsourced IT the arguments with sales people, the constant fear of being laid off from whatever random startup I'm at for the next few months. 

I don't want to do this anymore but I don't know how to make a change.  I don't have a family to support and I'm in my early 30s which is not too bad but I constantly have this feeling that its too late and I just have to stay on this same path.

Has anyone here experience a similar career burnout and how did you push through it or get over it?"
1548,just lonely,"i miss someone that I haven't met. i feel homesick for somewhere that doesnt exist. anyone i get attached to hurts me in some way, whether they realise it or not.

i have friends but they don't feel right. i do like them of course, but i dont feel fully comfortable with them, I can't tell them my feelings. i can't express the things I love without them telling me to stop, and how it's getting annoying. 

it just feels so lonely. knowing no one really cares no matter how much to try to believe there is someone. 

i just want at least one person. who I can fully trust, be myself around, tell everything to, them not getting bored or annoyed, just someone to really care, without it feeling fake. someone I know isn't lying."
1549,I HOPE this song can make you guys feel better!!!!,"https://soundcloud.com/user-581505294/pure?ref=clipboard

Tell me what you thinkkkk
I write my songs with emotion so I hope all you amazing people going through hell can relate and feel less alone.
Also follow meeeeeee. Teeehee :)"
1550,Dont know who I am anymore,"Lately I've been feeling like I don't know who I am anymore. I am not working, I dont have friends/bf, just everyday is the same and it seems that I lost my ""personality"",my goals, myself. I feel I don't belong anywhere. Im getting mad."
1551,Drunk and stoned,"Eyyyy probably gonna binge and Purge + cut tonight, hopefully I won't text people&lt;3"
1552,I'm struggling to accept my autism,"For years I've been insecure about my diagnosis on the autism spectrum with aspergers, not because I feel different, but because of the stigma towards autism and the people who have it. I've always noticed a stigma that people with autism are ""neckbeards"" or ""creepy"" and every time I see that, I feel depressed and ashamed of myself even though I can't change that I'm autistic. I know that nobody here is a therapist, but I'd like to hear if anyone has any advice on how to accept my diagnosis? 

I feel like my first steps to feeling better about myself would be reaching out to others and learning how to accept that I can't change the way I was born."
1553,Why does it feel like my life is being played in third person rather than first person.,"For a few years now it feels like my life has sort of just been moving through the motions and I'm not really in control like someone else is playing my life like a third person video game. It feels like I'm never really paying full attention to things and always sort of in a haze, like when I'm biking or working I get moments where I go ""oh right, I'm biking right now I better concentrate"". Does this resonate with anyone else? Honestly I thought the fox would be to drink more coffee cuz it feels like I'm sleep deprived but that didn't fix it. Any ideas?"
1554,Stuck in my head,"I was doing fine at the start of everything, working from home, taking up old hobbies as well as new, hanging w my family. Then all of a sudden something stupid triggered me and I had a meltdown. I was diagnosed with PTSD, GAD, and severe depression as well as several phobias years ago. Till the quarantine started I was in a good place and had gone to only having therapy sessions as needed. I take my depression meds daily and had emergency anxiety meds in case of panic attacks. My career is good, relationships good, I was losing weight. The instant the meltdown happened I reached out to my boss, the other director of the shelter I work at, my therapist, and family. Everyone has been great. My boss gave me a week off paid without deducting from my PTO and told me to let him know if I need anything. I just had a meds eval with my doctor on Thursday and with the recommendation from my therapist she agrees I need daily anxiety meds along with my emergency ones. I have all the support of coworkers, volunteers, and friends and family but none of my outlets or behavioral therapy is getting me out of this funk. I'm constantly on the verge of tears and I don't know what to do anymore. Just needed an outlet to vent. I shutdown FB when this started so I don't have to see constant stressful news."
1555,Random thoughts,"Everyone now and then i think the most random, stupidest of things, theyre not negative just unique, i have no known disability that would cause this so i am curious if anyone has any idea as to what it could be?"
1556,Why am I not as confident?,"So, i used to do Irish dancing from the age of 7 to 11 and I used to love performing in front of crowds and learning choreographing.

But im now 20, and I cant even do a hand movement from the choreography (im trying to learn Kpop) but I end up getting into my own head too much and start hating myself.

People say that practice is the only way. Which is obvious. But how can I if the very action freams me out enough to stop me.

Any advice?"
1557,My memories don't feel like mine,"My trauma is so surreal it almost feels fake, I don't want to believe it was there.  For years I used to try to pretend it was all false memories in order to fit the narrative of a normal life.  As a child I used to imagine all of it was from a past life.  It feels like someone else's memories.  I don't feel anything like myself when I look at myself in those memories.  I can't recognize any part of my personhood.  I wish I was just delusional like my mom gaslighted me to believe I was.  It hurts too much to believe it all happened."
1558,how to keep my (kinda-ish) trauma about alcohol from affecting others,"(i wouldn’t really consider this trauma, but trauma kinda sums up how it affects me)

i (M15) have divorced parents, but the main reason they got divorced was my dad’s alcoholism and some actions he took in relation to it.

growing up, he would miss my sports meets, concerts, etc because of losing his license. during the divorce, i was used as a “spy” for my mother to look over his shoulder and hunt for beer cans when he was living in our basement. i’ve spent hours in police stations because he skipped court dates in relation to duis and was pulled over with us in the car.

because of this, i am wary with alcohol. i will not drink any (even if it’s just my sibling or mother offering me a sip of wine). this obviously does not cause issues, it’s even healthier.

BUT, i get extremely wary when friends of mine drink. obviously my friends are not legal, but i understand that, ya know, it’s high school. most of the time, i end up slightly freaking out at them and snapping. 

i know i can control people, so i need a way to manage this wariness. so yeah, lemme know if y’all have any ideas."
1559,My family won't believe me,"I am almost positive I have some sort of disability and I want to get checked just for some reassurance. My dad is very narcissistic and everyone in my family treats me like I have the mental capacity of a 10 year old and I kind of just go along with it because I feel like it makes them feel better about themselves so I haven't really minded it too much. I'm 19 now and I have a feeling that all of my dad's manipulation and my families degrading words have actually caused something in my head. The problem is that I have sometimes sarcastically and seriously mentioned mental health and in both cases everyone in my family brushed it off like it was nothing. So idk if they would even believe me if I got diagnosed with something. Any ideas on what I should do, also I'm sorry if I went on for to long I just had to get it off my chest and clear my head somewhere."
1560,Feeling hopeless during quarantine,"This may seem less serious than other issues on here but I’ve been really struggling with my mental health since quarantine started. I feel guilty for it because I know there’s a lot worse going on in the world but I just feel so unmotivated and hopeless?
My final year of uni was cut short because of the pandemic and while I’ve been struggling with anxiety for a while, recently it’s turned more into feelings of “there’s no point in anything” and I just don’t really know what to do with my life because finding a job just becoming even harder. This results in me constantly wishing I could go back in time (which obviously isn’t going to happen) instead of focusing on how to make the present/future better. 
Was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions on what I could do to combat these feelings?"
1561,Trying to get help,"Why is it so damn difficult to seek help from the school nurse/counsalor?
I just can't get myself to talk about my problems to anyone. Like literraly no one.
Many people have 1or2 people they talk to about their problems and help eachother. But i have none. It's so difficult. 
I may have difficulties talking to people because of my fear of them backstabbing me or just leaving me. When people talk behind my back i can't stop thinking about it.
I just want to talk to someone one on one in real life.

Sry if this text is a mess."
1562,what is this called?,"whenever something small doesn’t go my way or isn’t perfect i get really upset. for example, i’m not allowed my phone or echo at night so for the morning i ask my dad to wake me up. if he doesn’t wake me up at that time or somewhere close to i WILL cry about it. if i want to go on a run (and have been wanting to but not getting the chance) but i have to do laundry or wash the dishes i WILL cry and have no motivation at all and not want to talk to anyone. what is this called (btw i’ve had and noticed this around 2-3 years ago)?"
1563,Feeling paralyzed whenever anyone slightly raises their voice at me/sounds annoyed by me,"Whenever anyone responds blandly or criticizes me for something that didn't necessarily call for it, I tense up and my head goes blank and I can feel my face heat up. And then I spend the next few hours stressing over that one response and it even results in breakdowns sometimes. I keep thinking if my text was actually inappropriate and start to regret ever sending it; is this just me?"
1564,My last 5 months were not that great.,The last 5 months were not that great for me... I have an upcoming exam in 5 days that is very important and I feel totaly not prepared .I hope that I will get a 8.5/10 but the chances are pretty low ... Over that My social life has not been great either .... I didnt talk to anyone except my parents that come very late from work. I spend all of my days learning but failing .... I have no friends. No one wants to talk to me. And to put salt on the wound 3 months ago I got rejected by my only crush this year . I am in a very low point rn and feel bad the moment I wake up. I dont know how to deal with this .... Last year was great for me I got a gf and was happy most of my year and then around june she broke up with me and that was the moment my life went downhill from . From june to today no one opens up conversations with me . No one wants to talk with me. I feel lonley and sad. This year was really bad. I got bullied less than last year but I still fell like shit when I try to talk to my classmates. The only thing that is making me happy is my pasion. Wich I dont often do it rn because of my exam wich is on my mind everyday. If i dont get over 8.5 I will fail. And  my level rn is 7 at maths and 8 at my contry's language. I FEEL LIKE SHIT . I HATE THE PLACE WHERE MY LIFE IS RIGHT NOW. And I dont know how to escape the situation that Im in right now. I JUST WANT TO GO BACK..... Its 4am and I dont want to sleep because if I wake up then I got to do the same thing that I did for the last 5 months. Everyday feels the same .. I feel like a robot . Wake up . Learn . Eat . Sleep. I have no one to talk to so I can tell how I feel. My parents cant talk with me much because they arive at 8-10 pm. Even if quarantine didnt exist I still would not be able to talk with anyone.
1565,Helpless anger and insecurity,"I posted this to r/anger already but I think it might be applicable here more so than there. 

 

I feel like an evil jerk. I don't know why but whenever I feel someone has invaded my space (like they entered my apartment and we had a confrontation) I get so furious I start lashing out violently over stupid things. My roomba bumped into my leg a full day after someone I know and I had a disagreement I kicked it across the room like some kind of psycho (and bruised my foot, ow). I kind of go into this point where I'm super anxious but relatively normal, and then every little thing that happens is the 'last straw' and it's almost like I can't control my own body. It's scary, because what if I hurt someone I care about? I had one incident where one of my cats got into a very important package and was chewing on it and I had this awful impulse to throw her or do something awful. I feel like it's getting worse. I don't have fun hurting people or things, I dont get off on torturing animals or anything. It's just when I'm on this wire-thin string of composure I feel like something might happen. I know this has been going on for a long time- I've seriously hurt one of my sisters when we were younger but I hadn''t really connected it to this anger until I gained some self awareness on it. I think I'm either sick in the head or an awful person.

This may or may not be related, but I also have a huge issue with ownership. That is to say, insecurity over what is 'mine' and what isn't. I can't buy things used, and when my parents got me a dog when I was younger, they named her for me and it always, always peeved me. I didn't want anything to do with her. (Not a huge deal since the dog liked my mom more than me). I just didn't feel like it was 'mine. And now, some guy I have an issue with comes to my apartment and confronts me in my 'safe space' and now I'm going up the wall with trying to make it feel safe again.

My parents never let me go to therapy or see a psychiatrist (they're scientologists), which maybe is what I need. I don't know whats wrong with me, and I need to do something about it soon but I don't know what. Please don't yell at me, I don't know what to do and I'm freaked out. I'm suspecting anxiety and maybe even bi-polar. But I don't know anything about it since my parents wouldn't let me receive medical help and actively prevented me from learning about it.

I'm somewhat suicidal. I haven't made any attempts, but the temptation is strong. The only reason I haven't made an attempt is that my mother's friend's son shot himself with a shotgun and I know that if I killed myself or attempted to she'd lose it and may even hurt herself. Even so, I still feel the urge on an off-day basis; although I've never self-harmed. I don't know the reason why, but I'm afraid of letting my parents see any evidence since they would tell me just to go back to the Org. They think I'm making everything up.

I also have a very hard time concentrating and I have pretty frequent memory loss. Sometimes I sleep for 16 hours a day, sometimes missing important things due to it. Sometimes I do manage to feel okay, and I get a lot done but it never lasts very long and is pretty few and far between. I can't remember what people say after they tell me either."
1566,I feel so betrayed by my friends,"I know this problem im having might not be a big deal to some of you, but it literally made me cry and it's a big deal to me, at least right now. I also know we aren't supposed to be having parties right now but we're teenagers and my friends were going to have one whether I came or not (in this case I wasn't even invited) I just want to vent because I feel so betrayed and I'm realizing that I was probably never wanted in the friend group in the first place. It's not that they think I don't want to go, they know I have depression and I told them that at the last party i actually felt really happy, part of the reason this is such a big deal to me. I even told the person organizing the party that I want to go multiple times, and then they just went and had the party without me even knowing. It's not that they wanted to keep it small, it was the biggest party they've had yet, the only possible reasons left to why I wasn't invited is probably because im just that unwanted, or they forgot about me, but that's not much better. I don't know why I'm that unwanted, I try to be nice to everyone and I thought that these people were my friends, but I guess not. I was so excited for this party, i even got alcohol to bring and share with people, and then I find out that the party already happened last night and I wasn't even aware of it. I've been trying to improve myself lately; doing my homework, showering every day, keeping my room clean, things to help with my depression, and it actually had been working. But now I feel it's all pointless if I have no friends and nobody cares about me.


Sorry for the wall of text and horrible formatting, just wanted to vent.

TL:DR I wasn't invited to a party my friends were having and now I feel pointless"
1567,Im hearing strange whistling outside,"Its literally 2AM, idk if its audiory hallucinations, some random neighbor or the wind but its creeping me out lol."
1568,Recently Deleted Facebook and with it my Support Network.,"I just deleted facebook and messenger off my phone because I can't handle everyone hating each other. I don't want to delve into that anymore, though. Suffice it to say this should be good for my mental health.

However, it has had the unintended side effect of now I don't have my support network. I had a lot of friends who posted memes, some uplifting, some dark humor, and a lot that were mental health related. Basically I had some friends who made me laugh and now I don't get those laughs unless I go to a computer, which with a 7 month old isn't going to happen often. 

Any suggestions on ways to keep my mind occupied or to divert spirals etc.? I'll admit that scrolling without really reading was cathartic sometimes and I haven't figured out a safe way to do the same thing on Reddit yet. 

I know it's an impossible situation I'm in, but Facebook was literally making me suicidal on a daily basis and now I'm just suicidal from being so disconnected. It's dumb and I'm probably more venting than looking for solutions, but if you have anything for me please let me know!"
1569,Am I schizophrenic?,"So I’ll start from the beginning I guess. August of 2019 I started to get really depressed and I had stopped eating to the point where I would eat once a day or every few days. A few months after that around late December I started getting really anxious and I also started seeing and hearing things. I would sometimes see faces in walls or there would be like a man that would watch me from a distance, (kinda like slender but all black and not as tall) well I thought it had just to do with anxiety so I told my mom that I was depressed and that I was hearing things. She told me not to tell the dr that I was hearing things bc it was most likely in my head so I did what she said and my dr sent me to a therapist. I was at first kinda relived to go see one thinking I would get help but as soon as I entered the room I had a the feeling that this girl was going to follow me home and torture me. I kept the thought to myself but I was very scared of her after the therapy I told my mom that I don’t wanna go back and she respected me.

Well whenever I was getting hallucinations (mainly audible, rarely visual) I thought they were real but they would only last for a few seconds or few minutes then they would go away. This made school very hard and maintain friendships hard. Voices would tell me to do horrible things like suicide, hurting myself, hurting people because they were gonna hurt you first. I don’t know why but then I started having delusions where I thought my ex and my bestfriend hacked into my phone and was watching me and listening to me through the cameras. There were times where I’d be laying in bed about to fall asleep then I feel something get in bed with me and put there hand on my arm and whenever that happened I would freeze up. So one night I a week ago I decided to look up my symptoms and schizophrenia came up so I’ve been doing a lot of research on that. I never even heard of schizophrenia until I looked it up. I told my mom mostly everything including a bunch of other things not mentioned. I’m only 15 I’m terrified for what’s gonna happen whenever I go to the dr and tell her what’s really been happening and I’m afraid there gonna send me away because the voice that tells me the future said that’s gonna happen and I’m going to live there so am I crazy?? Because everything feels real and I’m scared. What should I do?"
1570,How do I stop overthinking everything?,"So like the title says, I tend to over think and analyze things, a lot. This is really frustrating because often it turns problems into a bigger deal than the actually are. 

I know this isn’t professional help, and I am seeing a counselor weekly, but any tips from Reddit would be greatly appreciated."
1571,Short feeling like I’m going to cry,"When I’m feeling bad about myself or really stressed out I get this small feeling in my throat like I’m gonna cry and then maybe a quiver in my lip and then I just swallow it and put it away. I don’t choose to move past it, I just feel myself dissipate the feeling if that makes sense. I don’t want to put it away! I really want to cry sometimes, I haven’t cried in years. I am worried that when I don’t let that energy out I am storing it somewhere inside me. Where may I have gotten this habit?"
1572,I think i have Schizophrenic when i was a kid,"I was still 7 and my grandpa always abused me and my sister (mostly me) saying ""your too thin"" or ""gain some weight"" after that he'll hurt us like kicking, punching, slapping,and chocking us

The birthday of my grandpa I began hearing voices that i should kill my grandpa with a knife stab him repeatedly until he dies because he scarred my during my childhood i didn't tell my parents I've been hearing voices i kept it as a secret for years and i still hear voices to kill him"
1573,Scared of going to sleep,I’m scared that when I go to sleep I’ll die. People always say dying in your sleep would be peaceful but the thought of going to sleep and then never waking up scares me. What do I do to overcome this fear?
1574,Rock Bottom and a light. (Hoping this helps somebody),"Maybe this will inspire somebody here. About a month ago I was going to kill myself. Finally hit the floor enough times, where I saw nothing left and made plans to end it all. Its been 11 years of struggling with multiple things. But I always wanted to make music. Had verses I’d write and just leave alone. That day I told myself, If im going to kill myself, lemme at least try and put a short song or rough demo out, like I’ve always wanted. I did. Wasnt perfect but I got alot of good feedback. Then made 2 more after that in a months time. My point is, I thought one day I was gonna wake up and I’d be ready to pursue what I wanted. Took mulitple mental breakdowns and hitting rock bottom to realize that day never comes, you just have to push through it. I still get the suicidal thoughts but not as much as I did before.

1575,how do i tell my parents i need help???,"i think i might have ADHD(i am NOT self diagnosing myself) i want to seek help from a therapist/medical professional and figure out what exactly is going on, but i’m scared my parent won’t take me seriously. i have taken medication in the past that was not prescribed to me and my mom knows about it so i’m afraid she will think i am just looking for meds(i’m not i just want help) she also does not “believe” in medication so even if i do have ADHD i’m not even sure she would do anything about it. i’ve thought about going to my dad first but i think he will just laugh at me and tell me i’m over reacting. i’m 16 so i can’t get help by myself. everyday is a struggle and i feel like i can’t do anything about it, at least not until i’m 18. looking for advice on how to tell my parents that i need help."
1576,“Men are disturbed not by....”,"A famous Stoic Epictetus once said “Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles and notions which they form concerning things. “ what you can take away from this quote is this... our main source of suffering comes directly from how we interpret our circumstances in life... everything external of our life is merely just an opportunity for us to act on it with certain emotions and thoughts."

1578,"I was doing really well, but now I’m getting consumed by childhood guilt and I’m spiralling","
TW: self-harm, bullying, homophobia

I’m not sure what happened. I had been feeling like my old self again before the anxiety &amp; depression and hadn’t self harmed in almost a year. Without a warning, I started remembering old things I did when I was like 12-14 years of age. Bad things.  I did it since I wanted to break my reputation of being the nice and quiet teachers pet and become popular and well liked. What is really haunting me is how I pretty much used to be homophobic. 


Some of the things I feel really remorseful about was how I used the word “gay” as an insult and comedy bit. I even kept on using it on my friend “jokingly” and they even told me “jokingly” to knock it off and I didn’t. It caused us to break up the friendship when we were like 13 since I thought they were overreacting. I can’t push that guilt off of me. I also played a part in spreading a rumor about someone else being non-straight in my freshman year of high school  (someone told me and I shared with someone else). 

I knew what I did was wrong at the time but not the gravity of it. The guilt is consuming me, more than it did when these events happened. It’s been more than 10 years. I can’t concentrate on anything else but these actions. I wish I could go back in time and never do it so I can finally feel like a good person. I didn’t think I was hurting anyone at the time, but I obviously was. 

Thank you for listening, I appreciate it."

1580,Do you ever get severely irritated by to many people talking at once,Lately when I’m at work (restaurant) and many people are talking at once my head starts to hurt and I become so wildly irritated that I can barely hear all the thoughts in my head at once. When I was little I could never focus on anything if someone was talking and I slowly grew out of it but lately it’s been back. If more than two people are talking at once I can barely function. Does anyone else have this problem or am I just being stupid?

I feel like I’m waiting for one thing to push me over the edge and nothing works.,"I want to die. I have two anxiety disorders and depression. I’ve been to counseling but all we do is talk about changing my mind set. But how can I change it? I can’t fake it til I make it because I don’t believe what they want me to believe. 

I just got into an argument with a cousin on Facebook... it was over a petty matter and this is probably the millionth time I’ve done this with people. I just get so angry. And I’m so sad. The psych ward did nothing to change me when I was there last year. 

I hate my life and everyone else would be better off without me. 

Jobless before COVID. Don’t pay rent. Pick fights and cry out of frustration at the drop of a hat. I’m so tired."
1582,I told my mom and sister that my brother used to molest me,"When I was 5-7 years old, my half-brother would molest me. I was young and I trusted him, and didn't know any better. I thought nothing of it growing up, and the experience led me to frequent sexual thoughts ever since. I couldn't sleep without having random fantasies, and I constantly craved relationships.

When I reached the age of 17, I realized how wrong the situation was. By that time my brother had already left home to live with his girlfriend. I told my mom the truth, hoping that would help me get overcome it. And all she had to tell me was, ""I knew."" I was shocked and confused, and I cut the conversation, deciding to keep my thoughts to myself. I cried that night.

Two years later my brother informs us that he wants to move back in because he and his girlfriend had broken up. I say no. He had come over to visit a few months prior, drunk out of his mind, and had tried to full on kiss me in the kitchen while my mom did whatever in the living room. I cried as I explained this to them and my sister and mom just sat there watching me. My mom explained to my sister that I had been molested as I child. I don't feel safe around him, I told them. And they still tried to convince me that it was the best thing to let him back in if we want to ""keep the family together"", as we aren't so close with out relatives and ""only have each other"". No, mom, I thought. I do not want to keep the family together. He is NOT my brother.

And yet they pressured me into giving in. I felt like the bad guy. Three of them versus me. And I'm the fucking victim.

I asked my mom why she never did anything if she knew about it all along. Three fucking years. She said she didn't want to believe -- accept -- the truth of the matter, because we were all her children. Fucking selfish."
1583,Younger brother is depressed. Need help.,"Hoping this is the right sub for this...

I have a brother a few years younger than me, approaching his mid/late 20s. His entire life has been a difficult struggle to overcome bullying, weight issues, self-image issues, everything. I probably didn't help back when we were kids - my life was a lot easier. Girls. Friends. Good grades. Etc. None of that for him.

His life is much better now and he's doing well for himself (on the outside). We've been getting closer and talking more (from separate states), but I'm realizing he still has a lot of trauma from these times in his life and he is depressed. He's not happy and hasn't really EVER felt happy, and doesn't really have hope or faith that happiness will come. He's cynical and jaded because of all the things he's dealt with, including a recent breakup from basically his only GF ever (*he* broke up with *her* because I think he just got bored and sick of arguing). 

I had a long talk with him to try to speak about the power of positive thought, gratitude, and many more things that I've learned and discovered about happiness and fulfillment, which he is severely lacking. 

He's open to seeing a therapist, and that will be helpful. Possibly even meds would be beneficial. But I'm not really sure what else I can do or how to speak to him in a way to actually help. I'm very positive and gentle and encouraging and I've told him to try and take more action and get out of his comfort zone to find what makes him happy. He doesn't know what that is. And I get that - many of us don't. But I see why for him it's a harder void to grapple with. He has some slight interests but doesn't feel GOOD at anything in particular. His happiness is closely tied to his desire for companionship (which he's been mostly deprived of and has a poor outlook on now).

He's not ugly or obese. He's a genuinely handsome guy, tall and a tad bit overweight, but nothing he couldn't shed with the right mindset and motivation. I'm aware none of these superficial things translate into someone's own self-image. His is damaged for sure.

He told me he's thought about suicide before, but fortunately I think it's only a thought. I know I need to take it serious though, and I did (by telling him to NOT think like that and why he has a lot of great things to live for). If nothing else, the pain he knows he would cause our family wouldn't allow him to do it, but I know that's not a great reason for someone on the edge.

Please help me help him."
1584,I feel so different and emotionally stunted.,"I'm 20 years old and in college, but I feel so much different than the people around me. They are able to converse easily, have friends, go to parties, be normal and I envy that. I sit in my room day after day wishing that I could have a group of friends, but whenever I try I am convinced that I am a bother, that no one wants to be around me and that I am draining the fun. I worry that I am a burden to them so I lock myself in. I don't talk to anyone. But when it's time to go out in public, I cannot even begin to tell you how conscious I feel about myself- all I could think is ""Are they looking at me"", ""Do I look like I'm doing something weird"", ""Am I standing weird"" and so on. And when it comes time to texting friends, I struggle to keep the message alive and I second guess everything that I text. So I'll text something and then I'll delete it because I'm like ""Oh this is stupid"". I know that things are nt the way that it seems, but I'm so sick of feeling different.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like my anxiety and OCD rendered me socially inept and it leaves me wishing that I could be normal. I wish that I could have normal experiences as my peers. Like on their social media- I will see them going to parties or just sitting with friends and I struggle to do that. I fucking struggle to keep a simple conversation and then I begin to obsess how this will affect me in the future.

I just wish I could be fuking normal."
1585,I cant stop contacting someone who wants nothing to do with me,"I have mental illness,, depression and a learning disability which makes my mind get stuck ont hings. I felt the same way about this girl for 15 years. She doesnt want to talk to me. Shes asked me not to contact her . I try so hard but i break. Because in all my life talking to her is all that helps. Without that i feel suicidal all the time, i just am too cowardly to do anything.

I know im being selfish and what im doing is wrong. I should just leave her be. But at the same time nothing else ive tried works. Ive been in and out of therapy, im on meds, try meditation. Ive lost 6kg starting working out but i feel no different. Im trying so hard and its for nothing.

I want to leave her be and respect her wishes, i really do. But i never even wanted other girls. The few ive talked to, i always feel they arent her or as good as her and i just cant forget that. Im all or nothing and got nothing.

Im tired of living like this. Her life and mine would be better with me gone.  Im sure of it. Because i dont feel my life is getting better just worse. Ive tried what i can and it just doesnt work. I feel so alone and alienated from society. If it all crashed down i wouldnt care. Idk. Maybe some people are better off dead and gone.

Im working up the courage to end things. I know i sound selfish and pathetic and disrespectful. I truly dont mean to be, its just i try and go back to the one thing thats ever helped. But its not fair on her . She owes me nothing no one does.

I just really want this all to end. I cant do this much more."
1586,Depression + Asperger + Anxiety + Cero Friends?,"So yeah. Before you ask, I have all those diagnoses... I usually help around reddit, talk to people. But where I am I can't rely on anyone... my grandmother had an stroke years back, she lives with my parents and me.  My father's a bit of a dead beat. And my mom carries everything on her shoulders... 

I try not to be overwhelmed... I look back on my suicidal times and hope and wish I never feel like that again... normally I'd just take one of my prescription pills to help me deal, but my mother is smiling. I rarely see her smile so openly, it's not a fake smile. I know those... if she sees me taking them, well that smile will break. I know how to pretend that am fine... I did it in college, before I dropped out. I don't regret it, I have my reasons. I made a decision. 

Somedays I try to exercise. But I have a project am working on... and beyond that I have little motivation to exercise I look on other people my age, twice the looks and twice the muscle... with the motivation to exercise while I, some days, can't push myself to eat properly. 

I feel particularly overwhelmed right now. I really don't have a reason for that... wished I did, though. Then perhaps the title to this wouldn't be a mathematical formula. I like comic books, typical awkward nerd, Darkseid's anti-life Equation... Sometimes it feels like it should start with a variable ""D"" for Depression."

1588,What do you do when you wanna expose someone for hurting you so bad that you developed a disorder from it but it's been so long that there's no reason to even bring it up...,"Having to take a deep breath here....
I ask myself ""was my childhood THAT bad??"" Alot. Trying to force myself into thinking I just developed all my issues from my own accord because I have and always feel like a piece of trash that can never be good enough for anyone. 

My family...the ones who should've been there at my downfall, were the ones standing there ready to push. 

I was sexually abused for 7 years by an older sibling. Grew up in a very strict Christian household so you are forbidden to speak of sex in a non educational way. I was labeled a whore by my mother and father when they discovered that I had been watching porn and speaking to people I shouldn't have on the internet, sending pictures back and forth. I started at the age of 11. 

Men that were clearly in their 30s talking to me and showing me attention, listening to me talk about my problems and telling me I was beautiful and had a beautiful body and how shitty my brother was for ever hurting me and that I should run away. 

But all along the way, was it really THAT bad? 

We didn't always have money, my dad didn't even go to college until I was 5-6. He mopped floors at a paper mill just to keep us going. My mom was a stay at home parent homeschooling us, giving us fun projects all the time and encouraging craftsmanship and artistic talent. 

My home was ideal to anyone who came over. So why did I dread being there. Ask anyone, they would've much rather came to my house because we were able to bake cookies and paint and make different crafts. But for me it was still..terrible. 

I finally had the chance to not be isolated at home around my abuser when my parents decided to send me to a Christian school. I thought it was amazing because I could hang out with friends without being around my parents... They knew about my brother when I told them because he tried a few times on my neighborhood friend at the time who ended up disassociating and saying it never happened when I told my boyfriend at the school who then showed the entire football team. (Private school, super small 100 people max including the teachers) 
So I was forced to leave the school due to causing drama. My mom I'm pretty sure spoke to the councilor assuring her that what I said never happened and that I'm a problem child. 
Well my mom quit the job she started in order to stay home so we couldn't possibly ""explore"" each other again. 
(He literally blackmailed me into doing it and admitted this) 
I was self harming...suicidal and angsty. I downed a bottle of ibuprofen and sat in the bathtub hoping I'd drown when I really just threw it up before it could do anything and hated myself for being such a failure. 
While I was withdrawn from the school, my brothers tuition was anonymously paid.. rubbing salt in the wound for me. 

I begged my parents to take me to therapy and to get medication. But my brother was better when he went to Bible camp so my parents said no. And added that it was dangerous because if I tell them what happened my parents could have me taken from them and my brother put in jail. And it wasn't fair that my parents worked so hard to get where they needed to be only for ME the failure of the family to tear everything apart. So I internalized that as me being the problem, maybe I did allow him to do things to me because I was just a messed up individual from watching porn (he started this as far as I can remember since I was 6-7) 

My dad on the other hand has a track record as well. My half sister has document proof from the court case where he was forced to give up parental rights or her mom would expose him for molesting her. 

Yeah this goes beyond just that. 

My sister barely saw us, my dad made sure we would understand that she would only believe the ""lies"" that were fed to her and she'd never see him as the father he was. So he would get angry and refuse for us to give her gifts sometimes, go to her wedding, he refused to have anything to do with his grand children. 

Because I was refused treatment for my issues besides you know. Being anointed with oil. My issues worsened and so my parents both deemed me a whore and a pill popper because at one point I was so desperate I asked a friend for her depression medication so I wouldn't be suicidal anymore. I was determined to change myself. 

Fast forward some more of me picking the wrong guys including one who molested his 5 year old cousin and blamed it on me and called me from jail cussing me out because I wouldn't have sex with him (I was 13). 
Well for 8th grade and highschool I was enrolled in a public school system. It was crazy that I fit in with everyone there so much better. 

Fast forward a little more past me going through typical bullying and suicidal friends who ended up in the hospital and other horrible guys (a couple okay ones and some chicks) I find who is now my husband, at first he didn't believe a word that came out of my mouth and thought I was lying for attention, until he met my parents. I refused for him to meet my brother and he still hasn't to this day. 

Well before my parents met him, I kept him a secret and snuck out to see him, my mom ended up thinking I was having sex with my best friend and not a guy cuz she saw a hicky and demanded that I would find a friend to live with and leave. Well I did but that was a stupid move cuz the friend I tried to at the time didn't tell her grandmother and she cussed me out driving me back to my parents house drunk as shit and my mom denied the entire thing. 

She was so relieved to find out that it was a guy who gave me a hicky and not my friend. He was the only thing keeping me sane while my mom would come in my room throwing fishnet tights at me that she went out of her way to buy just to come home and call me a prostitute but still she refused for me to get help because they could go to jail. 
I got very rebellious, snuck out of the house many times especially when I had my car but I had to hide every single phone I ever had because my dad would freak out if I even listened to a non Christian band. One day I tested him too far and he smashed my phone into the corner of the table which sent me straight to the bathroom my mom at the other end banging on the door telling me I better not kill myself. 

I finally had enough of this shit when I was 18. I had a job and a car so I thought I was totally independent enough to leave. I moved in with a friend and her large family and family friends living there too. Welp that worked out well. 

Me and my husband broke up with each other at the time because I was going crazy wanting to drink and smoke pot all the time and have sex. I was definitely not in the right state of mind. Not to mention my mom was calling me threatening to get me fired, expelled and locked up. 
Meanwhile experiencing first hand what happens when someone falls down the hole of addiction to heavy drugs, stealing and running from the police. Our neighborhood was completely surrounded by the police. They came in and swept the house not knowing that the person ran and hid under a mattress and in an abandoned house. Days of running and no sleep. 

Basically I told my husband I couldn't take it anymore there either and begged him to move in with me and have a baby. So we did, same neighborhood, different friend. They ended up kicking us out when I had about 2 months left of highschool or so. I was desperate, looking for a place to live we rented the cheapest place we could find and after moving all the clothes in, I instantly had a meltdown and decided I could not do it. I wasn't going to be pregnant living in this filthy run down home. So we moved again...finally finished highschool miraculously graduating on the honor roll during all this ontop of living hours away from the school (able to do online work) 

Me and my husband lived with his dad for a while and had alot of issues fighting with each other and battling mental health ontop of all this plus my parents trying to chummy up to me because I was pregnant while simultaneously downing me and also getting mad that I refused to invite my brother and his wife to my baby shower ""his wife forgave him for molesting you so everything's fine now, you need to get over it"". 

Later while visiting my mom she even took me to my brother's house when my first baby was only a couple months old to ""drop something off"" while on the way to taking me home, but it was a sly attempt at letting them see my kid.  




I moved states eventually after living with in-laws for a while we got our own place but also his brother is here too instead of his other siblings. And we are doing fine now but....i still talk to my parents after a while of distancing myself from them. I want my children to know them but something deep inside hurts so badly and I keep remembering my dad saying ""what did I do that was so bad that made you want to leave""...you weren't there for me in the time I needed you the most and instead made my brother the hero of the story....the straight A student who had a 4.0 when I only had a 3.8 I got yelled at for having a 95 on a test one time because my brother wouldnt have missed those questions. 


After all that. One part of me wants to expose them for what they did. I'm still pissed that my parents and brother are living the life of luxury, being lucky enough to make it big and get engineering money. When I'm over here living paycheck to paycheck. I can't entirely blame them..I could've stayed home. I could've went to college. I could've waited to have kids. None of that was on my parents. I did all those things myself. And I feel like I'm absolute garbage because I made those decisions. 

I don't even know the point I'm trying to make anymore. 

I'm 21
Married, and I can't even have sex without intrusive thoughts. 
I developed severe pure OCD (internalized where your compulsions aren't the same as washing your hands 5 times in a row) 
I also developed DID. A mild form yet it's still haunting. 

I'm living through it. I stay strong for my babies because they deserve someone who gives a shit. Someone who's not going to let their minds crumble and fall apart because they can't wrap their minds around such a horrific chain of events. They need someone stable and strong enough to show them how to stand in the midst of intense darkness. 


But I still fight myself every day. It creeps up no matter how many projects I give myself. 

I don't know why I made this post.. I wanna expose them for what they did to me but I still feel like I'm the piece of trash who needs constant approval because after all. They're the ones who are living their best lives. 

For anyone who took the time to read this...thanks ❤️"
1589,Unable to cry,"I struggle with depression and anxiety. I’m currently on anti-depressants. Last week I cried probably for 3 days straight and was unable to sleep. This week I’m a little better but I feel so depressed, lonely and like my life isn’t going anywhere. A part of me wants to cry just to fill something, but I physically can’t. Does that happen often? I just feel so empty and don’t know what to do to let go of this feeling."
1590,Do you feel like people see you as less human cause your balding?,"Im a guy in my late 20’s and I feel that people can’t see past the fact that I’m balding?

I go to a friends house they have to talk about it. I see my parents, they mention about their distaste/disappointment that I am balding. My co-workers at work make somewhat rude indirect comments about it. I go to the barber and they have to make disappointed comments about it. 

Like I’m not even balding that badly? It’s just at its initial stages. But I feel like people can’t even see me as me anymore. It feels like I’m stripped of my character over my balding. I mean I can’t really do anything other than go on medication to control it, it’s out of my control as it’s genetics.

It’s gotten to the point where I don’t feel like talking to people, I don’t want to see friends or family, and more so just want to be alone. I’m honestly quite happy having alone time. But I get intense anxiety about going and meeting people I know, cause I feel like I’m going to get judged.

What if they hate me. What if I annoy them. What if I left, would they notice? What if I died, would they notice?

I know deep inside that they would notice they would care but my head just keeps telling me they don't. That they do all this because they feel bad or because they pity me. I feel like nothing is real. Nothing matters. I don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe I have a slight hope someone will see this. Maybe I have a slight hope that if I write it out, it will all go away. I thought that talking about it would help but all they say is no we care about you. Not we understand how you feel. I just want someone to understand how it feels to be constantly reminded that everyone leaves at one point. There's only one person that hasn't left me yet.

Basically what im asking is, once the situation is brought to light and told should i go on with my life and even with this bad experience should it not matter to me anymore once justice is served ?  


i just feel like its disturbing that i havnt told anyone about the thing and how vile it was and i just let it be in my memories i feel like i would be perfectly happy afterwards,mabe if this particular thing affects how i am now and i wonder about that but who knows i've kinda accepted that no one has perfect experiences they are kinda just placed into this world they have things that block their growth and we can help each other together"

My stepfather has been molesting me since I was 17 years. It started off with inappropriate conversations, then touching, and then forcing me to give him oral sex. I reported him several times, but nothing was ever done to him. I got really bad punishments from him for trying to report abuse. 

I am now 21. He raped &amp; sodomized me almost a week ago, for the first time &amp; raped me again last night a second time. 

I’m not really processing it well. My panic attacks have gotten extreme worse, suicidal thoughts, and Ive been self harming. 

I haven’t reported it. I’m actually scared to report it. He’s scarred me. I feel really low and I don’t know what to do with myself. I’ve just locked myself away, hoping he doesn’t come back for more. I feel sick. 

I need advice. I’m not mentally able to go through this alone."
1601,what’s your take on self diagnosis?,"this goes for any mental illness.
Personally, i am strongly against it. there’s nothing wrong with saying “i think i have *insert mental illness*” but there’s a difference between that and saying you have whatever mental illness without a professional diagnosis."
1602,"Just because someone has a mental illness or mental disability doesn't mean they shouldn't own a gun, or that they're not competent enough to safely do so.","I'm surprised how much I've been told this since I bought my first gun. It's rude and ableist, and it's been an extremely degrading experience having the same thing be said to me over and over. ""Uhh, are you sure you should own a gun?"" ""I wouldn't trust you with a gun."" ""Mental health disability is a big red flag."" Someone's mental health in regards to their gun ownership is none of your business. A lot of states have criteria that need to be met now to buy one, so that's between them, the state, and sometimes their psychiatrist."
1603,Head Injuries and Brain Damage,"Hey all, 

I'm new to this Reddit,  so forgive me if I'm posting under the wrong category. I had a pretty bad injury back in 2013 and it left me with longterm brain damage which has made life at times more ""interesting"" than I'd like, as well as some general trust issues due to my overall situation. I recently got up the courage to finally talk about it some, and just wanted to say to anyone else who may be going through this, that you're not alone. I hope it helps some. 

[Living with a Head Injury](https://youtu.be/sv9Cgja3Gi4)"
1604,I look in the mirror and I don't look right,"I look in the mirror and after a minute I get a feeling like something's wrong. It feels like there's something off about my face. Sometimes when I do something, it recognize I'm doing the thing, but it feels like I'm not. I'm not too sure why."
1605,Not welcome in church due to depression,"yep.. shared with minister in confidentially.. the pandemic made him take advantage and says I can not join the zoom, which I'm like if it were real church they couldn't kick me out... they will cut of people instead of having the ""mentally ill"" person deemed by the minister who has no psychology degree...

&amp;#x200B;

joining at 11 a.m Pacific tomorrow in protest if you could join the zoom and say mental health matters and you discriminate the depressed that would mean everything to me.. I know the world is fighting so many battles but to see a minister advocate for black lives a month after he basically has said my depressed life doesn't matter is BS

&amp;#x200B;

so Tomorrow 10:55 a, Pacific

1606,Pathetic but honest drug fueled rant from a mentally ill weirdo.,"Stuck in an ugly farm town I hate, been here my whole life. Only time I'm feeling excited is when booted up at a party,in a city or about to have sex. Never at either because I've ruined most my short lived friendships.Social skills have completely deteriorated from already being bad. Never finish anything, I'm pretty stupid. Want to hop on a bus and be broke and not finish my education or just die.  Haven't gotten laid In almost a year. Can't function without my adderall xr or speed pills.Horribly dependent on nicotine and dabs. Always down to do whatever drug. Hate my body, hate myself more. Bored, anxious, depressed. Who isn't tho? Having deluded thoughts that everything we see on the media is brainwashing and can't tell what's real or not. Get told I'm attractive often, become uglier and uglier the more I project my stupid, mumbling, slurry voice. Done scummy things I regret.  going through a hypochondriac stage from months old swollen lymphnodes on my neck.
 I realized that getting a terminal illness is 50/50 because dying or living both sound like equally garbage options. Constant subconscious need for attention that I can not control. Had a fucked up childhood and was exposed to certain themes that I feel have made me autistic or some shit. Done alot of good and been nice but it doesn't out weigh the bad and being mean. Pathological liar(being honest rn). Constant worrying since I was a kid. Grew up a fat kid btw, went through a bully stage until i thankfully got beat up. Still feel like a stupid kid despite being 19. Didn't spend any of my youth doing sports or socializing because I wouldn't ever stick with it. Wouldn't take my ADD meds as a kid. Don't want to tell my therapist who I  constantly lie to. Afraid she'll take my addys away because of weed and I won't be able to function. Constant highs and lows. Mostly low.  Always Oversharing. Constant brain fog. Impulsive behavior that I've for the most part taken control of. Done alot of crazy shit. Either really good with people or really bad. Constantly worried about myself and my family. Fake confidence. Hurt people,stole,lied. Have a cheating fetish that's ruined any good relationships I've been in. Along with other porn induced and unhealthy fetishes. Probably fried my already semi functional brain in multiple different ways. I just want to leave. Getting my license back soon but I'm afraid of being a homeless drifter. I need to explore, see the rest of the world. At 14 I Argued with my childhood bestfriend. We roasted each other and it turned mean. We quit talking for months . He then died of Leukemia. Couldn't even get over myself for my dying friend. I bring out the worst in people on accident. A lot better than I once was even just a year ago. Still garbage. Still scum. Stupid. Will change, hopefully tomorrow, or the next day."
1607,Anyone feel full body tingles when they’re really really sad?,"Idk how to describe it but when I’m in a depressive episode and I’m crying or feel so utterly sad I get these pangs like tingling pangs in my arms, pit of my stomach, full body really. Even though the sensation doesn’t hurt it still feels like I can physically feel the pain I’m emotionally feeling. Idk if that makes sense but I was curious if anyone else felt this too."
1608,Feeling abnormal again now that people are allowed to go out again,"Lockdown restrictions are being lowered in my country and people are allowed to move but I can't. I feel so trapped. I couldn't get my licence yet because I get too anxious and my mind goes blank. Anyway, my family doesn't own a car. My family also doesn't allow me to use public transport or Uber because it's ""dangerous"". Before the quarantine, the only place I used to go to is university but who knows when that will be opening again. I can see people are going out again and I feel so left out, jealous and angry at my own situation. I can't stop crying about it. I feel like I can't take it anymore. 

For the past 3 months I felt normal almost because people were living my lifestyle but now I see how different I am. I have social anxiety so I never used to want to go out but I'm on meds now and I'm ready to put myself out there but I can't. 

At home my parents are hoarding more now. Most of the sofas are filled with stuff so even watching TV is stressful. They get angry at me if I try to clean. I can't do this anymore. I can't live in filth at home with not being able to escape to uni. I feel like I'm going insane. I can't see an end to this."
1609,Tripped balls,It's hard staying sober in my house so A few days ago I ate an edible and it was really strong. I ended up being very high and had this overwhelming urge to hurt myself and just end it? I came to and I'm still have the urge to just hurt myself. I didn't want to alarm my family but I dont know how to deal with this anymore.
1610,Why do I feel guilty/angry/sad for not liking things that past/child me liked,"Over the last month I have started wanting answers of why I express some unhealthy behaviours so I can fix them, and there is this one behaviour that I can’t find help for anywhere, it’s if something is bad/unpleasant but had something to do with my past/childhood I get to angry and then feel guilty about not liking it.
an example is me and my friend were playing sea of thieves and the tutorial had pirate/classical sounds and I get mad because I can’t drive a ship for my life and I just started crying and was torn because I wasn’t having fun after spending 50$ on a game and the music that I loved as a kid was playing.
another one of these things happened when I bought a book about model railways as I do that in my spare time but when I got it it was a paper back for people just learning how to read and started making fun of all the facts they got wrong and then out of nowhere I started to feel guilty and started to tear up thinking how 5 year old me would be so happy to get a book like that.
I really at this point just want a reason why this happens so I stop feeling like this and just be happy with now.
Any help would be helpful"
1611,Looking for advice on where to start,"I want to apologize ahead of time for rambling here, or if I am in the wrong place looking for advice. I am certain I need some sort of help. I am really not sure where else to ask because the information I find online is often conflicting.  I am truly afraid to ask for help in a public, self-identifying manner because I don't want to be held in a facility. I am clinically depressed, with major health anxiety issues. I have suicidal ideation. I heavily depend on alcohol to process my emotions. I know I need help. My problem is that there are many levels of mental healthcare professionals, and I can't seem to figure out which type of professional is best suited to deal with my issues. I am sure that if the state of my mental health is too advanced for a certain professional it would be easy to get a referral for another, more specified professional that is better suited to deal with my particular issues, but I am not sure where to start. A counselor, clinician, therapist, psychologist? I am not sure the difference and what kind of support each could provide. Thank you for your time and input."
1612,Emotional Numbness,"So, for the past few years I have been dealing with major depression. I am feeling a lot better overall now and am actually being productive. But I still just feel emotionally numb. It’s not like I feel no emotion at all, just not much. The best way I can describe it would be to compare it to talking with someone, but you have earplugs in and you can barely hear them or understand what they are saying. They’re just like muted or something. I haven’t cried in about 5 years now. I used to be a pretty emotional kid but I think that (I could be talking out of my ass here i don’t know) when the depression hit me I just subconsciously suppressed my emotions so I wouldn’t have to deal with them. And now I’m fumbling around a dark room and I can’t find the switch to turn them back on. I’m not sure what I’m looking for by posting this here, maybe some words of advice or something, but I’ll probably just go to a doctor about this. I’ve also found it very difficult to talk to people and make friends. I don’t know if that’s related at all, but I just graduated highschool a week ago, and I have nobody I consider important to me, besides maybe my sister. My parents are assholes and it’s very hard to confide in them. When I first told them I was depressed they accused me of just trying to manipulate them, but that’s beside the point. If anyone actually reads this or responds, thank you for taking the time out of your day to do that."
1613,debilitating nostalgia,"hi all! so basically for my whole life i've had this tendency to revel deeply in nostalgia. it's always been a compulsion, an itch that i have to scratch. for instance, today i was feeling nostalgic about my ex boyfriend, so i just spent a half hour reading our old text messages, remembering what it was like to be together and reliving some of those feelings. it obviously only makes me feel worse. anyway i was wondering if you guys have felt this/how you've dealt with it/if this is an actual mental health issue/anything... thanks!"
1614,I just feel like things aren't really good right now,"I'm a university student and i study at Toronto Canada. But when it's summer I come back to my country where my whole family lives. I don't really know what happens when i come back home but i just brake down somehow. I feel like a grey cloud follows me wherever i go but i manage to smile to my friends. When they ask me how I'm doing i can lie and say that I'm doing good. And sometimes i do feel like I'm okay but other times i just feel like a useless piece of shit that is no good for anyone. I don't even know if it's valid for me to write here. I feel like I'm just not good enough for anything. And my girlfriend is one of the most amazing things that ever happened to me but i just feel so bad that i can't describe how i feel to her. 

Like one minute I'm okay, but next thing you know I'm just having thoughts that I shouldn't be having. My mind just fucks with me and i hate the fact that I can't really talk about it."
1615,"As I've gotten more depressed, I have a harder time recognizing my own friends and family.","Sometimes I'd look at pictures of an ex and I had a hard time recognizing her despite seeing her 2 weeks prior. I would think ""I was with this person?"" and I assumed it was just because of heartbreak. 

Lately I've gotten worse mentally lately and I'd stare at my parents and I had a hard time recognizing who they were, as if I've never met them. I knew they were my parents and I loved them, but I had a hard time recognizing their faces. Just today I had the same experience with my sister where I unironically asked ""is that my sister? "" and genuinely thought it was someone else. I didn't recognize her voice or face at all despite seeing her and talking to her just yesterday at dinner. Both of my closest friends I had moments where I questioned if I actually knew them even though I met up with both of them and acknowledging their existence without issue fairly recently before that weird disconnect. 

I don't know why I'm experiencing this so suddenly, I have a good memory and I dont know if I'm just disconnecting from reality or what. I have never experienced this before. 

If anyone can help me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you."
1616,How do people make friends?,"I'm an undergrad student. Being an introvert and a shy person I've always struggled with making friends.the ones I make, I feel most of them using me. Always asking for stuff. Perhaps it maybe because I don't ask others for various things."
1617,The way people behave is incredibly upseting. I can't look at any current events related sites without becoming upset. How do you cope?,Just avoid anything news or politics related?
1618,Question: Where do I post OC mental health awareness pictorials. Is it okay if I post it here?,.
1619,My story about the painful process of self-acceptance,"Most of my life, I have tried to emulate the great to get rid of depression, anxiety, and existential angst.  My path led me to self-improvement, spirituality, and many more—exciting areas of self-inquiry.  But something was always missing.   After seeing the animation movie The Little Prince on Netflix, I remembered my promise as a child when I read to book, that I would not lose my sense of wonder for the world. By the end of the film, I was in tears how much I have lost in becoming a functioning adult in society.  So, I started working on finding a center of belonging, what people could call a soul.  By living more intuitively, I have come to realize that learning through external sources will install an external authority. You are conditioned by ideas and your hunger for knowledge, power, love, etc. Without knowing it, you become a kind of automation in your adult life with invisible buttons. When someone presses them, you have auto-response.  Therefore most of us live in a world made up of a subset of beliefs, habits, and ideas that resonated with the originator and have some benefits but do not have to reflect our internal compass.    
To dive deeper into this specific topic on authenticity, I have written about my philosophical journey within Nietsche framework for personal transformation. If you feel that the current methods do not seem to work for you, read my story, and take what you need from it.

1620,I am having trouble understanding my emotional state,"For the past 2 years I've noticed i was slowly becoming unemotional or sympathetic to family and freinds. Ive talked to my parents and best freinds and while my parents think I am turning into a sociopath due to my past truamas (suicide attemps, sexual assault, emotional manipulation from past relationships, watching someone take their life in front of me) I'm worried if this will affect me negativly in my life and im asling to know if what i have is a serious mental issue or if is this nothing to think about. I thought i would asl here since going to a psychiatrist in both unavailable and dont want to spend too much money like I did with therapy. I did some research into this and most of it wasnt helping me understand my situation.
So, whats wrong with me or is there anything wrong with me at all?"
1621,Downhill I guess lol,"Lost it all- how my life changes quickly 

2017: I had countless numbers of friends and was very liked, known and “popular”. I hid the fact I was depressed and had other issues after my best friend was shot and killed. This fucked me up since I grew up and loved him
Like a brother.
2018- Still well liked, less popular, depression got worse, felt alone and empty everyday. Tried to *TW* commit suicide. Told one of my close friends about it and we barely talked since. My girlfriend was also a super insecure person who made my life miserable this year lol. Made some friends who eventually would leave as well
2019- still depressed, lost a lot of people and friends i knew, told one of my childhood best friends about my depression and we haven’t talked since. Didn’t hang out with anyone for 11 months. 
2020- I haven’t seen or hung out with anyone since January 2019, people don’t respond to my invites. I never get any.  I really don’t understand how I lost 25-30 friends. People I cared and care about. 

I don’t quite understand what changed, I haven’t change how I act or my personality but just super quickly everything changed. I have nobody left. I don’t want to exist anymore. I have been nothing but supportive and kind to everyone. And yet they all leave. I want to do the same I want to leave myself behind. I want this life to be over with I guess. My life after 2016 hit all time lows every year. I’m losing everything. Everyone just leaves :). I hate being alone I always feel alone. Not just physically but mentally knowing I have nobody who cares for me kinda traumatized me. :)"

1623,Free online counseling?,"I wish I could, but I can't afford to pay for counseling.

So, does anyone happen to know of somewhere online that is free? I'm just in such a bad state right now and I'm trying to find anything. I don't have any friends to confide in anymore, so I'm all alone in what I'm dealing with."
1624,Are you alright?,"Is everything okay? Are you alright? Talk to me, tell me what’s up - you matter and I am here to listen"
1625,Help me Understand me,"For as long as I remember I have been a go with the flow person. I’m a relaxed person who doesn’t have many worries. I have very few friends. A girl friend who I don’t know if either of us likes one another. Parents who don’t cate much for me. I just float on forward in life. Even with no worries I have contemplated and attempted suicide. I don’t know if I want to even participate in life.

 I enjoy things still but I feel as though I have no purpose or reason to keep dragging myself along. I have done enough I guess, I’ve saved 3 lives, I’ve explored what I want. And idk there is not much left. I don’t get a lot of enjoyment out of things anymore other than two things I love. The beach and basketball.

 I don’t have friends family or a significant other who truly cares about me. So why keep moving forward. So idk my last three options are disappearing and creating a new life, dying doing something cool I guess, or idk just float through life some more. Idk any info would be cool I guess."
1626,Not ok. Relationship ending.,I am not doing well.  I think my relationship is over.  Nobody's fault.  Both of us are dealing with a lot of issues outside of the relationship.  Need a hug.
1627,What’s wrong with me?,"For the past couple years, I have had a horrible feeling that makes me feel not like myself. I honestly don’t even remember what I used to act like. Whenever I feel excitement or happiness, I remember my guilt and how everything is just going to end. I have very little acquaintances and don’t have a close friend. All relationships where I can talk to someone and be social have all ended. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve been thinking it’s depression for anxiety, but I think I’m overthinking it. I often worry about my future. I have even planned out where I’d live, what college to go to, my major, and even how I’d die eventually. I have been feeling guilty about my first crush. He was a very sweet, funny, and relatable boy. We used to talk and play a lot together. Now, I think I may have emotionally hurt him. I think I have hurt him badly. He used to be a pretty social person. Now, he rarely talks to people he knew. I think I hurt him because I wondered if he was gay. I talked to friend about this. I don’t know if she told him about it. I am not friends with her anymore because she and her family hate me. Her family has fat shamed me and have spread rumors about my family. I never hated people that are part of the LGBTQ+. I have my respect ps for them, considering I’m asexual. That boy has never talked to me since. Every time he sees me, he looks sad or sometimes angry. My mom is another reason I feel horrible. She has told me that when I was in her stomach, she had to do so much. That I understand. Being pregnant is hard. My father had abused her and was an alcoholic. He was brainwashed due to being an alcoholic. Now he is fine and has a new wife. That new wife is horrible. My mom has told me I could die wherever I want. I could jump off a bridge, or die on the street. She makes so sad I sometimes cry at night when everyone is asleep. I also weigh a lot more for my age. I am just a 13 year old at 180 pounds. I feel horrible in my body. Sometimes I feel so horrible I am selfish. My mother has always talked about herself. No one has asked my how I’m doing so far. I also have very low self esteem. I play in an orchestra. I love the viola, but had been discouraged from it. I’ve worked hard on trying to get into the orchestra chamber. I thought the people that got in were worse sounding than me. I thought I was better. I’m wrong for that. I realized that life is so simple. You only are born, make a story, and die. My mom only believes that I’m not hurt if I’m not physically injured. I just think that life is very blank and simple. I’ll die in the next 20 or more years. School makes me feel bad, too. I am very smart for my age, but I feel that doesn’t matter. I only force myself to get good grades. I only think that getting good grades will bring me happiness. It doesn’t. I dont know what makes me happy. I love anime and manga, but I see my reality when I am happy. Reality is really painful to me. I realize that we all end up the same, we die lonely. I have been feeling so horrible, I have made imaginary friends. I think that’s not normal. In the end I just need someone to be with me all the time. Someone that cares for me. And I know people have it worse than me. So what’s wrong with me?"
1628,I feel like my parents are both singlehandedly destroying and throwing away my mental health,I live in California and I’m 13 years old and I love with my parents. I have been seeing a therapist and have written a suicide note before and I’m gay. My parents are fighting all the time and they’re divorced. I hate this feeling and I want to move out. Is this possible? Can anyone here give me tips or advice or answer as to what I should do. I feel like when I’m alone I lose control. Plz help
1629,I can’t self harm like before.,"I’ve been cutting since I was 11 (I’m 19 now) and I was never scared. It was my relief and I found comfort in sliding the blade and watching my blood drip. I accidentally cut it open when I was 17 and got stitches. The doctor told me that a lot of people don’t mean to cut so deep and end up bleeding out badly or taking their life by accident. Ever since, I can’t cut like before. I can’t go as deep because I no longer know the line between a normal cut and a deep cut that needs stitches. I keep doing small thin cuts that are basically scratches and they don’t bleed a lot like before. I’m not entirely sure where it comes from. Has this happened to anyone else?"
1630,Obsessive thoughts?,"Does anyone else have this thing where when they are even a little bit happy a thought comes in like ""you can't be happy because other people have gone through terrible things and if they can't be happy you can't"" or when you feel upset about something, I think ""you can't be upset Because other people have worse problems"" or sometimes I feel bad simply because my problems aren't as bad as other people. It's a really obsessive thought I have all the time and it's driving me mad. Literally. I can't think of anything else or even be happy."
1631,Family Issues,Is it okay to want to just give up and run away?
1632,"I can’t realistically afford a psychologist, but I feel like I need one. Anyone have any advice?","Im going to leave out all the juicy details because that’s not my question. I’m currently taking psych meds but I don’t ever talk to anyone about what’s going on. My PCP gives me my meds so it’s been about 2-3 years since I last talked about it. The meds are great but there is a lot more going on that needs to be worked out, and throwing sedatives at it just postpones the issues. I can come up with the money for a couple of sessions but it’s just not going to be sustainable for me. I want help, just don’t have access to it right now. Anything will be much appreciated."
1633,I just need overall advice for getting through my last 4 assignments for the semester at Uni,Im finding myself just insanely stressed with 4 assignments due in a period of 2 weeks. I can’t get them moved or changed and I just would like some suggestions for keeping the stress and fear at bay.
1634,How do I be content with my life?,"hello everyone, I'm 20 years old my transition from high school to university was absolutely brutal. during high school, I had a lot of friends and I was in a long term relationship that in my opinion was okay and I was actually happy I felt I was surrounded by people that actually want me and like spending time with me. Sadly I went to study abroad since I got accepted to a good university which made me and my girlfriend breakup along with other reasons, also my friends and myself made new friends which made us forget about each other. 

sorry for all the chitchat, my question is how do I become content in my new life. how do I move on from the fact I lost many friends and a relationship and feel happy with the new small group that I'm in? how do I stop mentioning memories from the pst out of context? I really want to enjoy my life but I keep comparing the things I'm doing now with things that happened a long time ago.   
Thank you."
1635,You have nightmares...,"...I wake up crying after having told someone in my dream I love them, to which they answer: ""You like to say things like that when you feel good for 5 minutes, hm?"""
1636,What is a good way to get therapy during our current situations?,"I haven’t been to my therapists’ in 4 months now. I was wondering if there are some tried and trusted online therapy sessions I can book. I don’t want to spend too much money, just want to share and get another perspective because everything is overwhelming right now."
1637,I have a question about Catatonic Schizophrenia..,Has anyone ever dealt with this or gone thru it. OR knows anyone who has.
1638,I don't feel like I was meant to be human,"For the past few years I have feeling really strongly that I was meant to be a higher being with more( like a entity/spirit).

I have a strong sense of justice and have always felt a connection to the spiritual realm. I feel like as a human I can't bring out my ideals of justice. 

I also have always imagined myself as a spirit not a human. No one seems to understand me. I'll have periods where I feel extremely strong about this then other times where I dismiss it.

I don't know why I feel this way. I have never been diagnosed with schizophrenia or even suggested the idea."

1640,I feel like I can’t take it anymore,For the past 3 months I’ve been super depressed and have a lot of anxiety I feel like it’s just constant negative thoughts . Thoughts that I know is not true  I feel like I’ll never get better I feel like this feeling is never going to stop these thoughts are never going to go away   I feel so sad so tired so exhausted of feeling this way  I don’t know what else to do  I try everything to distract my mind and nothing works I just feel like I can’t deal with this anymore I could barley sleep or eat . Sometimes it gets so bad that I feel sick I’ll throw up I have body aches I could barley get out of bed I just keep asking myself  when is  this going to stop when is this going to get better cause honestly this is so hard I’m so scared
1641,How do I deal with anxiety in times of social distancing?,"I've been dealing with anxiety off and on for most of my adult life.  Since I have had a steady job and income these last few years, I have been feeling a lot better.  However, since the coronavirus and social distancing, my anxiety has gone through the roof.  I've had to cancel a lot of plans and I feel trapped.  Also, because I'm an introvert, I don't have a lot of close friends.  This is really hurting me in this time of isolation.  I don't know what to do when I feel like this.  It's gotten to the point where it's really a physical anxiety, muscles aches, feelings of restlessness, and lack of exercise.  How do I deal with this anxiety in a time of social distancing."

1643,"Bulimia is fucking my head. I feel disgusting after vomiting two times within 10 minutes. I feel fat and want to slice my stomach off. I’ve been bulimic for 9 years and counting. I, honestly, see no end.","I’m not fat per se but I feel fat.

Covid and quarantine has affected my eating disorder badly. I have to deal with the Asian custom (at least, on where our family follows) of eating together with your family since I’m stuck at home. 

Now, it stressed me out everyday that I have to eat only to vomit. I vomit 3-8 times a day and I never had a day off from this cycle ever since 2020 started. I’m sick and tired of myself. 

I just vomited 20 mins from posting and it’s 2 consecutive times within 10 minutes. I ate dinner and I felt fat because... there’s food in my stomach. Then, my step mom made us eat cake. And my brain just binged ate eat. I should have eaten 1 small spoon of it but I ate... let’s not get to that. So here I am again, less than 10 minutes from my last purging... running to the toilet and putting my whole face to the toilet bowl with all fingers in my mouth. Practically wanting that everything I ate would be thrown up. 

I feel tired and lethargic now. I feel disgusting. I want to cut my stomach off; slice it away from my body — I don’t want it. Why do I need and want to be boney-skinny? Why did society made that concept rooted to my head for years? I don’t think I can recover unless I’m bone-dead. It’s all I ever wanted. 

All I can think right now is to not eat. I won’t vomit if I won’t eat. But then, my stomach ulcers will kill me. Idk how to end this cycle and I don’t feel like I’m living life anymore as vomiting is the only thing I constantly do. 

Idk what to do... My relationship with food and myself is messed up. I feel miserable."
1644,I posted here the other night about my dreams and slightly about suicide but it got worse and then better,Idk if it was just my lack of sleep since I feel a lot better now I still should probably go to bed soon instead of being on here typing this but I wanted to give an update to anyone concerned about the previous post if you read it I basically talked about my longing to feel the pain I’ve inflicted on others I just had the feeling out of nowhere and kind of wanted to vent but as of rn it’s gone which is good I guess it might and probably will eventually come back but for now it’s fine I’ll probably see a therapist or something that I can go to just when I feel like I need the help most instead of like a weekly thing since Im not the type of person that has problems with my mental health weekly or bi weekly it’s more once a month or every few months where I have big problems that need talking about after my post though I did start to have some more actually suicidal thoughts like that I should find out what my dad did the night he died so I could take the same drugs and call the police so they could come and I could shoot them before shooting myself and that if any time would be good for killing myself it’d be right now I’m not really feeling that same way though that I was now and I think that’s largely because I’ve been able to talk to the girl I like about everything going on too and I even asked her if she had ever liked me as something more than a friend which she’s not done previously but wouldn’t be closed off to meaning she’s only really seen me as a really close friend for the time that I’ve known her but that if I were to ask her her if she’d like to go do something not necessarily dating yet but eventually if she liked it enough then she might say yes which is now kind of what I’m thinking about doing once I get a job which I have one place I’m pretty much guaranteed to get a job at because of my history there and for decent pay too at least decent for a 17 year old that only wants to save money right now so that he can pay for his future projects and then I’ll also be able to get started on studying for the ged which I’m planning to take instead of continuing high school so that I can just go into college already instead of waste my time with two more years of high school since I pretty much failed all my core classes this year out of not being willing to do school work TLDR: stuff was only going downhill the more I stayed up last night (even having suicidal thoughts) but once I got some sleep I felt a lot better and it also helped that I got to talk to the girl I like about where we stand and everything else going only our lives

1649,Dealing with shame and guilt,"I'm just curious to find out if there are other people who have to deal with this.
I have to deal with a lot of shame and guilt for things I have done in the past (and yes, it is definitely justified).
Of course I'm not the only person having to deal with that, that would be ridiculous.
But since like 3 weeks I can't stop playing scenarios in my head that did not happen to me and realising how wrong I would have reacted in those situations.
(of course I am still reminded of embarrassing things that actually happened  and they way I treated others).

Do other people do this? 
Because right now I do this literally from the moment I wake up to when I fall asleep, and please believe me, I'm not exaggerating, it's literally non stop 24/7, the only thoughts I ever have.

Also, I know ideally I would be talking to a therapist, but in the end only I can make this stop by dealing with it, and right now I just wanna now about other people's experiences"

1651,A question about how/if SSRIs worked for you,"Question about how i know my SSRI has worked

Hi everyone.
I’m a 25 year old male and I’ve been on Fluoxetine primarily for Pure OCD (or at least I think it’s OCD) as well as presumably various other mental health issues I’ve had for as long as I can remember. I’m currently on week 7.5 of my medication and I feel no better, different maybe but definitely not better. I’m no longer hysterically upset 24/7, not eating/sleeping etc. But I still feel absolutely awful. My obsessions/compulsions are still as strong as ever and causing my crippling anxiety and distress and within the last week I’ve also been feeling very nauseous.

I’ve been through this same experience before twice within the last 5 years and both previous times I’ve recovered and been normal (or at least felt normal) but both times I’ve foolishly stopped taking the meds and relapsed, the most recent being 7.5 weeks ago. The trouble is I literally cannot remember the recovery process from either of the previous times whatsoever except I’m sure it didn’t take this long.

I’m honestly in a really bad place at the moment and what makes it worse is that I’m worried the tablets have worked and this is as good as it’s going to get and I’m honestly losing hope. Every day feels harder and harder and even though I’m not longer in hysterics over it I feel as though I’ve accepted my hopeless situation and it frightens the life out of me. I just want more than anything for things to go back to normal but I don’t feel like they ever will.

I’d happily continue on my meds for life (assuming they work) if I had to as they’ve saved my life twice previously and I’d honestly rather avoid therapy if possible as I don’t react well to it plus I’m incredibly afraid, ashamed and embarrassed (not about having therapy but about opening up about my problems.)

I suppose the point of this post is to ask about people’s recovery processes. How long did it take? how did you feel? Was it instant like a light switch or did it take weeks/months? Etc. 

Right now I feel so hopeless and down. I feel like nothing is every going to get better and I’ll be stuck like this for what’s left of my life and I really don’t want that. Other than the mental health issues that control it, my life is generally good. I’ve always been incredibly anxious even as a kid (I couldn’t even cross the street on my own if there was someone I didn’t trust there at one point) but in regards to family life and my  general situation I couldn’t ask for better. But I’m not sure how much longer I can go on feeling like this, it’s too much and things don’t seem to be getting better. I don’t want to just “accept” how I am because I feel as though I’m just trading one negative state for another and neither are preferable.

I’ve been trying to distract myself with normal activities I enjoy like gaming, movies etc. And I’ve moved into my girlfriends house for moral support but honestly I’m finding it all so difficult and distracting myself is, in a way, making me feel worse as time goes on. Like I’m just trying to pretend the problems aren’t there only for them to come rushing back as soon as I remember or have a negative thought and it’s so tiring. I always told myself that by the 6 week mark things would be better but as I’m now approaching 8 weeks and still in such a mess I’m honestly on the cusp of giving up and I don’t want to. 

Thanks.

TLDR: How did the recovery process for your SSRIs happen?"
1652,what can i do ? :),"I'm 16 and I can feel that I'm slowly drifting away from my family. Whenever I speak, they just scold me and I can't stop hurting my family. I decided to just be quiet so I wouldn't cause any more problems but they still treat me like a punching bag where they let all their anger out. I can't open up to anybody because I'm socially inept and when I tried telling my family, they just called me a drama queen."
1653,Social media Stalking.,"So i met with this girl on a social media platforms.
and she is so much obsessed with me that,wherever i go be it on any social app she finds me out,which i really appreciate this in a way or the other cause, in today's world when people rarely care about each other especially on social media she really cares about me,she really works hard to waste her time completely just for me. Can u people even imagine,how important i am to her.

and yes,many people likes her but out of them two not two,four, no not four.. actually everyone tries hard to be her eye candy but one boy he really loves her hard and sometime she just get insecure about him.

The main reason for her insecuriy is me since she had a doubt that i have some feelings for him.
Though i made it very clear earlier that i don't have anything for her play boy  but you know sometimes insecurities they just come out. 
 she is still staking me due to her insecurities.

It will be great help for her if you people help her out from all this.
poor girl.i really feel bad for her."

1655,"I (21F) am fed up of my negative mindset and toxic thought process sabotaging all my relationships, how can I help myself change?","Lots of text incoming, tldr at the bottom.

Just a super upfront, I need help kinda post. Huge disclaimer, I know the things I am about to say are unhealthy; I have identified a lot of unhealthy things about my thought patterns I'm just overcome with frustration that I don't know how to fix them. I've used titles if you want to skim read.

BACKGROUND;
 I've been with my boyfriend just over a year now. I know I should trust him and things should be super great and I really really want that. But some stuff gets in the way. I had a lot of childhood trauma and grew up without a father as he committed suicide when I was 7, I was kicked out of my home when I was 15 because my mum's boyfriend tried to sexually assault my little sister, been cheated on before, etc. My relationships with guys have always been a bit weird, I usually make really good friends with them, and if I get romantically involved it becomes a whirlwind romance where I'm gonna marry them, for like the first 4 months or so. And usually they feel the same.

UNHEALTHY TURN; 
But I always kind of change at around the same point in every relationship. I become really jealous, as in if the guy talks to another girl in a nice way I'm certain that I'm done for, though I know better than to outwardly show it so I let it just fester and try very hard to keep it in check so as no harm is done. I start placing a lot of worth on frequency of sex, and worry I am becoming unattractive if it doesn't seem frequent enough, even when I'm not particularly in the mood, though again i make sure I do not outwardly react to this as I know it could create a lot of pressure on the relationship. I get silent sometimes if I'm in a mood because I need to work it over in my head and don't know how to express it rationally, which I know guys hate but I can't help from doing it. And I begin thinking wow, yep he resents me and will definitely come to resent me if he doesn't already. He's going to leave, he's gonna cheat. I know I'm not beautiful and I compare myself to any attractive woman my boyfriend interacts with, which means I sometimes seek assurance. I KNOW this is annoying and my boyfriend tells me this is silly and unnecessary to do every time I do it, and asked me wouldn't I get annoyed if he did the same? I agreed, I would, I want him to trust that I love him more than anything and think he's beautiful, without having to keep telling him.

 Again, I'm super aware this is all very unhealthy and a great recipe for pushing my partner away, hence my need for help.

MY PARTNER;
 I just have to say, my partner is incredible and, even after a year I have no doubt that I want to spend my life with him, we've been through a lot together and this lockdown has been a little tough, living with him and all, but it's also only proven we are a strong couple. I can't stand the thought of my own unhealthy behaviour sabotaging that like every relationship previous.

TRYING TO RESOLVE;
 I've started really noticing when these things come up in my head, and started being able to counter those thoughts when they come up to try to stop any kind of reaction or starting any unnecessary arguments, but this often takes a huge amount of thinking and rationalising before I can calm myself down. I know, in a way, this is a good thing; I'm managing to stop these shitty thoughts in their tracks and reverse them so as I begin thinking like a normal human before I let it take over me. But I just want to know... Does it get easier? Because it feels like a huge uphill battle every time, and I'm the only one who notices when I manage to win, because to anyone else obviously it just looks like I'm reacting exactly how I should by default when I do win.

THERAPY; 
I'd happily try therapy again, I've tried it many times before but it's never worked, and the waiting list is absolutely huge for free therapy, so before all the therapy comments come in, I'm super aware that maybe trying again would be beneficial, it's just impossible to see one within any reasonable timeframe. I tried to sign up to Better help but they were like ""nah you should find a real therapist we ain't ready for this shit"" which is completely garbage, why offer an accessable therapy service that declines half the people that need it for being TOO fucked up?

IN SUMMARY;
I just need some guidance because a lot of days I'll be like ""wow I'm doing great!"" And then something will happen or the next day comes and I realise how far I truly have to go to be happy and mentally healthy. It's really tough to try and grapple with and a lot of times exhausting. My partner knows of my past but I don't think he realises how much it affects me, and at the start of the relationship I would use these past events to explain some of my behaviour, but he saw it more as an excuse for the behaviours and got annoyed by it so I stopped trying. He's not the talking type, his worst nightmare is therapy, and I don't think I could ever really explain what I've been through to him without sounding like a walking sob story at this point, so I can't really just hash it out with him, as lovely as he is. Plus, my past is not his responsibility.

If anyone could offer any reassurance, advice or online services that can actually help me, I'd hugely appreciate it. Thanks for reading, I know I probably sound like a mega toxic person but I want more than anything to change that.


TLDR; my negative thought process often ruins my relationships and I'll be damned if I let it ruin this one. I'm starting to realise and slowly fix my ways, but it's a really difficult process and I'd appreciate some help where you can xox"
1656,How to deal with fears of getting help,"Over the last several weeks, I have observed significantly increased levels of irritability, anger issues and a consistent lack of positive emotions. I am concerned that this shift in emotional state may boil over into something more dangerous. I am starting to believe that it may be a good idea to pursue professional help, but one of my main hurdles is the fear that by reaching out for help for myself, I am tying up resources and that my issues may not be as serious as someone else's.

I am worried that I may not be able to deal with this hurdle effectively and would like advice to help deal with it so I can get help with my problems before they get worse.

Thanks"
1657,Be fat or don’t sleep,"So today after taking sleeping medication for approx 12 months, my doctors informed me that have put on almost 18kgs since starting the meds. Wonderful. 
I can honestly say that that Mirtazapine, has totally changed my life. I have been sleeping 8 hours a night, every night and my mental health has deffently been better for it. But now, I have to choose, do I want to be fat or unhealthy or do I want to sleep. Like seriously!?!? Just when I thought I had caught a break with things! :("
1658,Ashamed and angry with myself that I wasted an entire year. Possible to unfreeze mentally? Wrong to end my life? I’m A PATHETIC LOSER,"
I graduated from college summa Cum Laude with a graphic design degree in Sep 2019. Since then I have done nothing. In Oct I went for interviews etc. The next month I had a devastated family conflict and my family tore apart. I was the closest to one sister and I found out that she was gossiping about me behind me back. Everyone in my family had a side to them I didn’t know. That day I felt the the worst emotional pain. I ran to an isolated park to cry that day. I felt more alone than ever. Two days later my bird best friend died &amp; I was so devastated with no support and embarrassed to grieve over a bird. I ended up isolating myself from the world, stopped looking for jobs, and just continued eBay selling for money. I went out again to enjoy life for the first time 4 weeks later and two weeks after another bird friend died. I ended up having serious suicidal thoughts &amp; I tried therapy, but it didn’t help. It’s been months now, I live back with abusive parents, a dysfunctional family, I have no job, suicidal thoughts, hate myself, feel worthless, don’t see a point to live, &amp; I still can’t get myself to unfreeze and work on getting a more stable job. I can’t believe that I had so much passion &amp; so many dreams at one point. I had a potential business and a book ready to get published but I don’t have the energy or do I care to finish it. It’s been almost a year. I have no energy for life like I used to. Going to be 25 years old soon and look at what a pathetic loser I am"
1659,What could cause this?,"I (M15) don't really know what is going on, Every time I walk outside the house I convince myself that it's dangerous and somebody might be after me or following me, although I have never had any threats and nothing has ever happened, when this happens I often start shaking or panicking. This could be unrelated but around a year ago now I woke up to what I thought was screaming, it was so loud it seemed like it was coming from the house itself. In fear I ran to the bathroom where I sat about 15 minutes until my mum shouted if I was ok. I don't really remember what happened after that except that the next morning I woke up in the middle of the hallway"
1660,I LOST MY MIND FOR A SECOND AND IT WAS TERRIFYING!,"I just lost my mind for second, or reality or something. It was like I was dead, after having a “homicidal fantasy” thing again it hit different... Right after.. I laid down. Messed with my arm and talked about how vulnerable people are. My vision then kinda went black, I was breathing very very fast and heavy, my chest hurts. I thought I was dead, or something? And I was flipping out. I sat up after a few moments of that and shook my head and now I’m back to normal other than my chest hurts. What the hell was that? It wasn’t a panic attack, it felt nothing like one. I’ve had them before but this... This was crazy I legitimately lost my mind for like 25 minutes? God I’m in a lot of pain now. If this happens again I’m taking myself to the ER that was not normal I was... I was dead I swear to god I wasn’t real! I was fake! Everything was a delusion... It was so scary... I was so scared"

MENTAL HEALTH; when I get wound up, I mean I really get wound up. When I let these thoughts run unchecked or I'm too emotionally exhausted to go through the huge process to rationalise them, I have a full blown meltdown. I have anxiety attacks out the damn WAZOO and believe it is the end of the world and I am unloved and no one will ever truly want me. THIS, among other reasons, is why I need to turn myself around, as these meltdowns obviously put huge strain on myself and my relationship.

I have had the habit of procrastination from a very young age. But as time goes the procrastination level is increasing and I can't simply control it. I have this big exam coming up (it's similar to A levels) and the result of this exam depends on me going to a good university or being able to go at all. I'm from a 3rd world country where going to universities or colleges mean a lot if you want to have a  good-paying job or any non-labour job for that matter. But I just can't study, I procrastinate away all my time. I have studied almost nothing in the last 1 year and during the 3-month lockdown I haven't even been near books whatsoever. 

The problem is I know that doing this, not studying is going to have a very bad impact on my life. I can't possibly accomplish anything. I know all these but I still can't help myself. and at the same time *knowing that I'm destroying my lif*e is also literally killing me. Add to that some other issues and I'm having **suicidal thoughts** but at the same time I'm somehow scared to take my own life

I haven't really been able to share these with anyone because us well parents in 3rd world countries don't care about their children's mental health neither do I have any very close friend whom I can rant with. So I came up here and I was hoping you good people could give me some sort of suggestions or something that can make me stop procrastinating.

I know that I am stuck in life right now, but I'm afraid that this feeling will never go away, even if I found whatever I want to do. It just brings me uncertainty and deprives me of optimism. 

I don't want it to be this way for the rest of my life :("
1665,Needing help identifying my issue,"Hi there. I am 26 years old and still have not held down a job more than 2 years. I am now doing gig work self employment and it’s working well for me. 
I just want more for myself though. I have left jobs due to being treated bad for no reason by my bosses. I would also let them know about their behavior that was directed towards me was not okay. My last job was working in a lab as a specimen processor. After 7 months I lost it. I yelled and told my team lead and boss how crappy they were and told them how crappy they treated me. The entire room heard me yelling around. I left that same day. Told them I’m not coming back. Typically I’m a nice person and very to my self because I do have generalized anxiety disorder but for some reason I’m not lasting at jobs very long. Also on my breaks I go to my car. I get anxious on lunch breaks and want to be alone. Any suggestions?"
1666,i dont know what to do.,"as the title states, im not sure what to do anymore. I have plenty of things around me that im moderately good at and enjoyed doing, but i just dont feel like touching them. Everything that i got joy out of just feels bland and plain, i still have fun but that fleeting feeling fades and i just feel empty. i dont know what makes up me. everything just seems like the same picture painted in shades of grey, its just so frustrating. I dont know what i want anymore i dont know what i should do i just feel tired of the same thing over and over again. im stuck in this rut of the same processes theres no difference in each day, atleast when school was still in person i could go and fill my head with equations and facts rather than sit at home and wring out the fun from every one of my previously sacred hobbies. Now its all just plain, i stay home, watch youtube, maybe a movie, eat, sleep, and repeat. im tired. im trying to get a job but all i can do is wait. i dont despise working or doing things, i just want a distraction from my own self, i just want to feel even remotely happy again"
1667,I can’t love myself,"I’ve tried, but I just can’t. All I hear is fighting, between the outside world and between my family within ourselves. I can’t do it. I’ll just exist hating myself until it eventually kills me,I guess. That’s all I can hope for."
1668,Always changing my mind,"Hi so I wrote a separate post on my inability to keep a job for very long. I have another concern. Maybe someone knows how what is going on? Another problem is changing my mind all the time. I have a problem being able to stick to a career. I have a phlebotomy certificate, substitute teachers certificate and have not used either. I went from retail to health work in a lab. I get online to look for a job and it’s never the same area. My life outside of work stuff is like this too. I say I’m going to get up at 5am I do it for 1 week and stop for some reason. I cannot stick to a schedule it’s terrible. My life is passing and I need answers. I’m 26 and everyday I’m trying to get better but I feel stopped. Any feedback?"
1669,How accurate are self-diagnoses?,"I'm nearly certain I have OCD and have had it for several years and am finally going to a doctor next week. I always score severe on OCD tests and my experiences match almost any video I've seen on the topic. However, I am really scared I am going to be told ""actually you are just gay, not a real Catholic and those scary thoughts you get about sex with people you would never ever want to have sex with? Nah that's just denial, you're a deviant""( I don't mean gay thoughts by ""deviant"" I'm not THAT kind of Catholic,  I mean bad bad bad). I'm just so frightened that I secretly am inherently bad/a psychopath and in denial and using OCD as an excuse, even though these kinda thoughts never occured until I was 19 and I'm the kinda person who feels guilty over stuff most people wouldn't."
1670,I can feel my mental heath deteriorating.,My landlord has been harassing me from months now. I stopped exercising. I stopped eating to my normal capacity. I stopped reading. I literally stopped doing everything I enjoyed doing. Today I realized this is not normal and something is very wrong with mental health. Help me!
1671,I just want to vent to someone,"Redditors, a lot has happened the last year, I feel like talking about it and share perspectives, but am afraid to be a nuisance to my friends. I’m just not through talking about it all. I was doing better until yesterday and was hoping maybe I’d find someone here to talk to. Send me a DM if you want to be my mental health pen p(e)al(th)"
1672,Why am I avoiding treatment/help?,"Ive been having suicidal thoughts since i was a kid and i’ve just recently found out that having suicidal thoughts almost every day is not normal.  Also, my emotions aren’t very stable. When I’m sad, it goes to the very extreme. Ive tried to attempt suicide (mostly trying to jump down) but i always chickened out. But I return to normal quite fast too and after completely forget about it. I tend to forget a lot of things but when Im sad it’s like I just got hit by all of my problems at once.

My fiance has been telling me to get help as he thinks that my mind is too fragile and he cant handle it. It’s been 2 years and I still have not look for help. Im not sure why but I don’t want to look for help. Sometimes I thought to myself it’s probably because im scared. What if im actually perfectly normal and i cant use my instability to get away with things anymore. Idk if i should still look for help.. and i really dont know why i just keep delaying it like i refuse for it to be treated.."
1673,I don't know what todo anymore.,"I don't know what to do. I live in Aus and have tried to get help and non of it help. Everyday just feels like shit and im sick of living. I feel like i've started to go insane. I've started mumbling to myself and crying almost every night. I'm worried i'm going to cross the line and end it, if anyone can help please do."
1674,Don’t know what to do,"I’m at my last real effort. I attempted suicide at age 12 and have had ideation for as long as I can remember. Some things are happening in my life right now that I can’t control, beyond pandemic and racial injustice (although that stuff is just adding to it), and I haven’t been this close to suicide since I was twelve. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford therapy. I’m on meds. My doctor knows. I can’t go into a facility because I have a kid and my husband has to work and if my in laws watched my kiddo, I would have to explain all of this to them. 

I just want the pain to stop. I don’t want my family and friends to have to deal with it anymore. I’m sick of disappointing them. I’ve always been a failure and I just don’t want to feel it anymore. I just want rest. I want nothingness."
1675,Never had anxiety this bad,"I know this sounds stupid, and actually, it is. I've been avoiding doing my homework because everytime I think about it I feel physically sick so I avoid it even more  and it gets worse and worse and it's been a few weeks now, I avoid being around my parents because everytime I do I just get overwhelmed by fear of punishment. The day before yesterday something happend and i thought I'd get into serious trouble. I was so, so scared. I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and then put it back because I didn't want to go to the hospital before I was dead. And decided to do it at 2 am instead it felt like I couldn't breathe and I was gasping for air I didn't calm down untill a while after when I realized I was ok for now and was happy but then I realized that I wont be and that I was just stealing happiness from future me and that the more I am happy now from running away the consequences will get worse so I've decided to turn off my emotions, this never would've happend if I didn't let them control me. If I dont have the desire to things if I dont have fear this won't happen again.I'm honestly so damn stupid. I used to be bullied but even then, I was never dead serious when I said I wanted to die. But I am when it comes to homework?????? How pathetic is that!! I am living a great much better life right now so why are things this way. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post so I will delete this then, or I think its automatic"
1676,how did u get confident?,with overcoming anxiety!
1677,I don't feel human anymore.,"Have you ever felt less than human? Or let me rephrase that, has anyone ever made you feel less than human? I'm a teenage boy from Arkansas, and like many other teenagers have a lot of emotions. My problem is that most of these emotions are negative, and caused by two people who are supposed to help me. My mother is a Narcissist, who recently quit drinking. 
        She has emotionally abused me almost my entire life, dehumanizing me and degrading me. She talks to me like I'm nothing, and like I don't matter. She calls me many bad things and doesn't care about my emotions, she made me do band and then never came to my performances. She made me play football and didn't give a shit after she signed me up, when I found E.A.S.T (a program dedicated to solving problems in the community) she couldn't care less. 
       She's the main reason I dont want to be around long enough to see senior graduation, but she isn't the only reason. My little brother also degrades me like I'm human dogshit, and acts like im an inconvenience to the world. He calls me things like a ""retarded faggot bitch"" because I don't let him use my stuff, or says I should kill myself after every minor mistake I make. He has finished the job my mom started, and has basically driven me to the point where I don't feel human.
       Although my father and friends try to keep me from falling deeper into the hole, I feel myself slipping further and further towards the edge."
1678,I'm not ready to get better,"I've been putting off therapy for about a year now and today I just understood something. I don't think I even want to get better. My eating disorder, my laziness and self-pity, they're all coping mechanisms I don't have the motivation to work through. I'm not ready to commit to therapy and working through my issues. 


I feel awful saying this but I just don't have the willpower or motivation. I don't know what to do anymore because I have uni starting and I wanted to fix my life before that but I just don't have the energy."
1679,I have no idea what's going on with me.,"I am looking for some answers here. I recently realised I might have a legit problem when it comes to dating, maybe even socialising in general. When alone, I know for certain that my mind craves company - and I usualy react to it and go out with friend/ on a date. However, what happens after I am actually out there with somebody, has kept me confused and worried increasingly last couple of months. Almost always, after some (short) time, an urge to leave and go home to my room emerges. It is so strange and irrational, but at the same time it's strong enough for me to act and flee. Now, I have no idea how serious of an issue this might be or not be. I just feel exhausted and find myself questioning things I probably should not question. This behaviour prevents me from building relations I am otherwise sure I want to have. 

Thank you all for your time."
1680,Do you ever feel like you don't have the same thirst for life as others?,"I'm a 26 year old female, I have bipolar type 2, my mom died 3 years ago, however I am taking the right medication and feel good. My meds don't make me a zombie or stop me from feeling anything which is good. But does anyone else have this deep feeling that they just don't have the same thirst for life as other people (mentally ill or not)? This has just been my whole life, like embedded in me, I like going out with friends and all that stuff, being social, being out - but deep down I'd rather be at home, doing nothing.

This is made hard because my boyfriend is a person who loves being out and about.

I don't know, it's like I just don't have the same want to live life to it's fullest as other people do? Can't explain it the best really."
1681,what can make mania worse?,"i think i’m manic and going in and out of delusional. both have been getting more intense, the mania slowly building for a couple of weeks now and the delusions rapidly building for the past four days. while i’m in a state of self awareness, i figured i’d ask this

i’m not diagnosed with bd and i’ve honestly never been manic nor hypomanic (to my knowledge). i have been taking lithium for over two and a half years now, but i always thought it was for unipolar depression. i also take lexapro (3 years now), vyvanse (3 years too) and as needed xanax (1.5 years). i took remeron (3 years) until march when i quit it cold turkey because the restless legs and twitches at night were unbearable and i was tired of being so ravenous. im 20 and have a history of recurrent depressive episodes starting at 12, past hospitalizations, ptsd from r*pe at 12 and dissociative amnesia with the ptsd. despite having recurrent dep episodes and taking lithium, i don’t have an official bd diagnosis and i’ve never been manic

but i think i’m manic now. sleeping 2 hours a night, thinking something stupid like “what if a mouse wore a hat” and laughing hysterically for 10 minutes (he would be cute though), walking 6 miles a day, literally no appetite at all, for the first time in my life i love myself and i really do think i’m above everyone. which brings me to the delusions i think i’m having about being a goddess and this human body is just temporary because i have to see how humans live before i rule them. i have all these weird notes i’ve been writing, but at the same time it feels so real. like i don’t know which things are delusions and which is reality, it all feels real

so i’m typing super fast so i don’t think something like “the mania is part of my goddess initiation” and feed into my excited mood. what can i do while i’m calmer right now to make sure my mood doesn’t accelerate much? what can i do to try to ground myself? i’ve never been manic and despite being in treatment for years and being a psych major, i don’t know a lot about mania. i posted here yesterday but i got really confusing and had to take it down. just i could really use some advice please. 

i stopped taking my stimulant for now, i haven’t been drinking caffeine since realizing, haven’t drank alcohol or smoked weed in a week, and even if i can’t sleep i’m still lying in bed"
1682,i don’t feel like i’m me. please help,i feel as though i’ve taken over someone’s body. i feel like i’ve been abducted from my life in another world and stripped of all my memories and thrown into a body in this world and that at any moment someone from my old life is gonna magically pop into existence and take me back. and i want to go back i don’t want to be here. i’m stuck in this mundane boring life but i just don’t believe this is my life
1683,I don't care enough about life,"I don't know what's real. I don't know if I'm lying to myself, but I feel like I don't care anymore. I don't care about my future. I don't care about my life, but then again, here I am voicing my concerns. I know everyone's so tired of me being this useless, but I don't know....urrgghhh. I wish I could be more enthusiastic about living, about changing myself, but I'm not. I have to do *something* but then I wouldn't  want to do it. Contradictions upon contradictions. Someone ought to give me a gun. Like, stop. Just stop, brain. Stop making this so difficult."

1685,My school friend is harassing me.,"My friend from college that I’m not even close with and have only seen him outside of college once invited me to go camping last week. Couple days prior to the day I sincerely apologised and said I’m busy and can’t make it as I have a few things going on right now and I’ll get in contact with him when I can. It’s been a week since then and he has called me over 20 times on my number and social media late at night and early in the morning, waking me up and stressing me out. 

He lives far away and I’ve only just passed my driving test, all his friends that I don’t know will be there and he set me up with a girl that I do not wish to sleep with. I struggle with social anxiety which I have explained to him in the past. He also keeps on talking about women in a disgusting way, saying we can take turns making the tent sticky (the plan was to go camping) and loads of other horrible things. That and everything else was putting me off. 

I am actually going through some stuff right and everything was making it worse. I am starting to not want to be friends with him anymore with the way he acts and the things he says and how he is now harassing me and not giving me space when I clearly said I am busy and will contact him when I can, maybe I could have been more clear but I would of thought someone would get the picture? I could have probably done something different for this to not have happened but still... 

I’m asking for help on what to say to him and what I could do different next time myself.  

Thank you."
1686,Too far gone to recover ?,"As a male being bullied from middle to highschool and having emotionally unsupportive parents that shunned me once I decided to drop out because I couldn’t take the abuse anymore, is there anyway for me to recover. I’ve become bitter and never shared my struggles with anyone.  Now I can kinda share it only because I feel numb and kinda suffer from disassociation. My typical day these past 2 years has been staying in my room majority of the day. 

I also suffer from just so much anger and tension in my head. 
The only thing to really provide relief for me was weed but it made me aware of my emotions and it was so dark that I decided to not do it anymore. 

Furthermore was emotionally abused by my own family for not meeting their standards when I was going through hell all my adolescence in school. 


Am I too far gone to recover ? Like I’m in an extremely bad emotional state and have become a social recluse. Tried medication didn’t help. Even tried Benzos even they were not enough numb the pain . I’m not taking anything now maninly because nothing helped and I’m not going to take medication that has a bunch of side effects if it doesn’t help.


If anyone can share a recovery story similar to mine that would be great. 

I’m just looking for any advice and how to overcome severe emotional pain that was supersede for years"
1687,Unmotivated to do anything besides laying down. I don't want to live like this,"I (F22) get up in de morning/afternoon and I watch Netflix. Constantly interrupting my series my being on my phone, so not even enjoying that but I can't stop.



I don't work out anymore, I barely go outside, I barely eat, I've lost so much weight. Im too lazy to even look for a therapist or reply to some people on WhatsApp. I'm currently not working bc it had become impossible to do my job bc of my depression.



Ive tried working out and hanging out with friends. But I hate working out at home, and I still feel depressed. Crying while I'm working out. And then feeling hopeless that it doesn't make me feel any better bc it always used to. When I'm with friends I feel annoyed or empty. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Which scared me. 



Please don't give me advice about how I should just pick up a book or go outside and work out. Or meditating or journaling. I just cant seem to do it, otherwise I would've had done it already. I know ways to trigger dopamine and feel better. I just can't seem to make the first step. I'm stuck in a loop of sleeping and 'watching' Netflix. Im so tired, does anyone have advice to make the first step out of this? I don't want to live like this"
1688,How Do I Get Help For Friend In A Very Serious Psychosis Situation This Could Be Life Or Death,"First off I will say I do not know where this person is. She very recently moved within this month in Houston and we do not know where she is other than Cypress TX. She is constantly breaking down calling friends and has conspiracy theories about the government. She rapidly posts on every social media platform and is literally just screaming. She has already hurt herself. Talking to her literally does not make any sense, so I doubt this would help. This has happened 2 years ago and we had to involuntary hospitalize her. This current episode is going on day 5 now. The only problem this time is that we don’t know where she is exactly. I am guessing Facebook could do something, but I’m scared it will be too late before they give the authorities her location."

1691,Gad help for my mom,"Hey guys, I’m coming here because I don’t know what to do. A month ago today, my mom had a reaction to a medication which caused her to have a panic attack that lasted probably somewhere near 2 hours. Since then, she’s been diagnosed with gad, and prescribed all kind of medications. The thing is, she almost always gets the side effects of most prescription medications, so everything is making her symptoms worse. She can barely eat even though she’s forcing food, she can barely sleep even though she’s trying everything we can to try and get some, she’s foggy headed all the time and says it feels like she’s drunk, her gut health is all kinds of messed up, and she always has to have someone with her. I’ve struggled with symptoms similar to this since February, but medical marijuana helps a lot of my symptoms so I’m still able to function. I just don’t know what to do, she loses more hope every day, she’s tired of feeling like she’s living in a nightmare, and we’re tired with her as well.  She’s changed her diet (when she can force food, she’s only getting around 500 calories per day), she’s making sure to walk a bunch for exercise, she’s getting sunlight, practicing deep breathing, listening to happy music, staying supplemented and hydrated, and avoiding worrying about things, but none of it has helped. Has anyone else been in this situation? Has anyone else found relief? She’s been to multiple doctors, and they all just want to give her pills that she’ll most likely have a bad reaction to (some of them she already has in the past)"

Lyrics from Sir Elton John - Love me again

Oh, the joke was never hard to tell
Threw my spare change in the wishing well
The dream alone is always in your hands
If that don't fill the boy and build the man
A heart has many secrets, so I'm told
Through the years, a theory can grow cold
I'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear
The voice inside my head is the one I hear

Singing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again"

1700,When the Blues Becomes Depression: The Importance of Mental Health Therapy,https://telemind.com/blog/mood-disorders/when-the-blues-becomes-depression-the-importance-of-mental-health-therapy
1701,I’m constantly afraid the world is going to end,"I’ve always been afraid of death, but not usually for myself-for my family. 

It was bad as a child, if my mum invited me somewhere and I said no, I’d feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and an urge to go just incase something like a car crash happened. 

This has slowly escalated over the years. I’m now 26 and afraid of thunderstorms (which I used to love) because it feels like somethings wrong, almost apocalyptic. 

My partner and I are interested in politics and often discuss varying topics in the news etc. But lately, given what’s going on with the pandemic, BLM and the multiple countries that seem to be on the brink of war, I can’t discuss it as my anxiety just sky rockets. 

I just worry all of the time. 

I know therapy is the best option here and I’m currently on a wait list (around 6-8 months) but I wanted to know if anyone has experienced this and if there’s anything that may help ease these feelings."
1702,I (17M) don’t know what to do about my mental health anymore,"Hi. I’m a 17 year old boy living in America. I have been dealing with certain aspects of my mental health for a while, and I genuinely don’t know what to do anymore. I just want some kind of advice so I can try to fix it before college, preferably without medication.

I’m not quite sure how to describe what I’ve been going through, but there are a couple of aspects to it. 

1. I used to think I was the smartest person in the world, genuinely. I thought I could understand how people worked, what they wanted, even what they would like for me to do. I fell really hard into this idea and even acted on it a couple times, buying somebody something at one point because I thought it was what they wanted. It got to the point that I began to think I would be better at communicating with them if I acted differently towards them. I made characters, I guess, that I acted as with different people, and it did work for a while. I got too confident in this “ability,” at one point, I think, and that’s what made me realize I wasn’t really that good with people or that smart. I don’t know if any other thoughts like this have happened or are happening, but this is the one I can describe.

2. Those characters that I created kind of became their own people inside my head. Sometimes they would talk to me, sometimes to each other, it’s gotten to the point that I don’t know if they’re just characters I’ve created, or if they’re real. One of them has started saying very disturbing things that I won’t go into detail about. I have to admit that I have almost acted on one of these suggestions, specifically I wrote a suicide note with plans to kill myself, but my family intervened. Currently I am seeing a therapist for depression because of this intervention, but I don’t know if it’s really depression or something else.

3. I frequently have trouble concentrating and have started using fidget toys or whatever is available to try and focus. In this regard, music has been of great help to me. Whenever I was feeling a little off or fidgety I would pick up an instrument and start playing something to distract myself. The idea of music became so ingrained in my perception of coping that I have been seriously considering a performance major once I go to college. I have also found video games to be a great coping mechanism. 

That’s all I can think is wrong with my situation right now, there’s probably much more under the surface though. The only person I have told about this so far is my girlfriend. If you don’t have any advice that’s fine, but thank you for considering anyways. Have a nice day."
1703,Advice on encouraging parents to seek help and go to therapy?,"Anyone else experience this?

I know my mom and I struggle with very similar kinds of depression and anxiety. Ive been open with her about how much therapy has helped me deal with it, but she won't give it a chance. Its clear that she has no one to talk to, and I know she would benefit so much from going to a counselor. 

Is everyone going to tell me the only person I have control over is myself and I have to let it go? Or are there resources to help? Has anyone successfully gotten their parent to seek mental health care?"
1704,Nothing I do raises my self esteem,"I have a long history of mental bullshit and it’s destroyed my self esteem. I can’t stop comparing myself to other people, criticizing every little thing I do, ruminating about whether I’m a failure or not. I’ve been talking to my therapist but nothing seems to help. It’s making me seriously depressed and I don’t know what else to do. Anyone got suggestions for stuff like this???"
1705,"Potential eating disorder, calorie counting, anxiety","Hello, I’m posting here as I’m really struggling with my eating habits taking over my life. Last year i wanted to lose a bit of weight, and over the course of a year I’ve gone from 14.8 stone to 10.8 stone, through calorie counting and exercise. Im getting worried however, as its starting to take over my life. I love eating, but feel guilty whenever i eat, even if its within my ‘calorie limit’. Im terrified of putting on weight and exercise 2-3 times a day. Anything that involves food or drinking, i see as calories and weigh these things up in my head. Im a 6ft 1 male and I currently eat around 1500 calories a day, with around 700 calories of exercise. I feel stressed at the thought of eating, and not being in control of my eating. Today for example, i went for a picnic with my mum and she brought the picnic. I ate two sandwiches, a bag of twiglets and some mini oreos, and now feel terrible. Its frustrating as now that experience which was lovely feels slightly ruined. Im not sure what i want out of posting about this, I just dont want this to rule my life anymore. Everything has become about weight loss and calories and its so frustrating. I want to stay healthy and enjoy food and maintain my weight, but at the moment I cant think about anything else. Im sorry if this isnt relevant, but any tips or reading to help would be really appreciated. Thank you in advance"
1706,How do I get help?,"Based in the UK (specifically England), 17F
How do I go about getting help with anxiety (preferably without my parents knowing, I don't want to bother them with it... Every time I try to say something, I get too nervous and bail out -_-)

Oh and on another note (idk if this is related) how do you get help with social skills? I feel like I don't know how to talk to people and feel really awkward."
1707,"A family member has been reading my posts on reddit. I feel sick... I post some really strange things here without thinking. It just tells me I need to be more careful what I post, but I don’t like being monitored online.",I had no idea anyone knew my user.
1708,I think I might have hurt myself if it weren't for my mom,"I've been having a horrible month, incapable of coping with my freelance work.    
   
Every week is a cycle of panic attacks and frantic working on the computer and sending work that I know sucks to my clients.     
    
Now looking at my computer screen makes me want to die. I know that the consequences will be shitty if I don't finish the work on time and to a good quality, both for me and my client, but all I feel like doing is slicing my computer monitor with a knife and screaming.   
   
I mostly just cry and scream but today felt a strong urge to end my life during my weekly breakdown. I am thankful for my mom for being around and calming me down.   

   
But I feel like a crybaby and  burdon on my family and everyone else. I think it makes me a bad person, and that society has no place for talentless hacks like me.   
   
I can't do this anymore, but how will I financially support myself and my family otherwise....     
   
I think I am a coward to feel like this at my work, considering the hardships that other people face without complaining"
1709,"Is there a place where people who can’t express themselves, can shout just to let it all out alone?","I wish there is a place where I can shout to myself and talk to myself frankly. I want just say a loud scream without disturbing anyone. I want to free my chest with my self inflicted emotional stress. Overthinking and worries are taking over me. 

Hope at least this post of mine would give me a relief."
1710,What does bipolar feel like?,"I am worried whether I am bipolar or I have depression with moderate anxiety. Idk. Sometimes I can’t sleep. Especially lately. Sometimes I feel excitement but like it’s too much excitement and i become hyper focused on one thing. It’s weird. Idk if that’s anxiety. This doesn’t happen very often. Most of the time I’m pretty low and negative. I also have very invasive thoughts. Over daydream...to the point it affects me “living”....maybe it’s just to escape because I hate my life. 

I can’t remember how I felt being consistently okay for at least a week lol. It feels like I have breakdowns at LEAST once or twice in a week. 

I’m just trying to understand myself. The better I understand myself, the better I’ll know how to help myself. 

Maybe just tell me about your experiences even if you don’t have bipolar."
1711,"Hey guys, I really need your help rn......","It’s been awhile since my last post. Now that we’re in quarantine, I’ve done a lot of thinking. I’ve looked back on the years and have noticed something huge in my life. I’m scared of my dad. He never physically assaulted me or abused me in anyway. He just has a bad temper and can say awful things to my brother and I. My dad has always been a vocal person for as long as I can remember. When I was little, I never really thought about it to much because he was my dad. But, as soon as I got older (maybe 7-9) he grew more vocal towards my family. He would get annoyed by the slightest things and get so mad that my mom would have to step in and tell us to go to our room to block out the noise. If nothing was perfect for his standards, we would hear about it. As the years past, it only got worse. Nothing was ever good enough for him. I eventually stopped telling him things and tried to avoid him at all costs. I think now looking back, I crave positive attention because all I’ve ever received from him is negative feedback. I have older siblings as well. They have all moved away and have ceased contact with my family including my brother and I. I never understood why until now. They left because of him. When I was younger I was always afraid of my friends dads and would always refuse to talk to them or to ask them for anything. I think I got that from my dad being so mean to us that I wasn’t comfortable enough around them. (They were all nice people btw it wasn’t like they were mean or anything). My brother isn’t affected as much as I am. I’m guessing because he’s a boy and he just couldn’t care less. Around the beginning of quarantine, I was helping my brother move rooms since he wanted to move into the basement. I had to take an air conditioner and move it out of the way. I placed it on the mattress and chunks of dirt came out of it. My dad went Biserk and said “Your a fucking dumbass!!! How could you be so stupid”. And right after he left the room, I broke down into tears into my grandmas arms. After, I thought I was overreacting and my grandma told me not to accept the fact that he hurt me emotionally because it wasn’t my fault. I’ve been trying to research why I’m so scared of him and why I’m so shy and I can’t really find anything. Ive been told my whole life that I’m just a quite person. I came to accept it but I wanted to know why. I also believe that because of my father, I cannot lose any weight. I was debating weather or not to see a therapist but I’m to afraid to tell my mom that something is wrong with me. I realize that my problems shouldn’t be everyone’s concern and that their are far worse things going on rn. But, I really needed to write this. Not only for some answers, but for someone to help me. I don’t want to be quiet. I don’t want to be scared anymore. I just wanna be comfortable and be able to talk to people."
1712,Confused and sad. Unsatisfied with my life. I think I might just be a slut from birth,"I am a bisexual woman in the deep south. I was raised Christian but as an adult I've gone irreligious with the occasional indulgence in some new age woo just for fun. I am a writer. I'm married to a nice man. Things aren't really so bad I guess.

The trouble is i have a constant stabbing feeling in my brain that this is all wrong. What would I do if I were left to my own devices? Probably not this.

I love my husband with all my heart. But I don't know if I can love just one person, and that scares me. I feel like I don't fit in this monogamous society. There's something inside of me fighting it's way out all the time and it's a person I wish I could be.

I don't belong here. I can't live like this. I have too much love.

When I think of the ideal scenario, it's me in the absolute center of an orgy because deep down I am utterly insatiable. Of course, my husband is there because I love him, but he's never been able to keep up with me. So in my idea of my true self, I'd want him there but with many, many others.

I want to feel connected to everyone. I want to be naked on the grass, beneath the sun, but how can I? No one would have me. My husband would be jealous. My family would disown me.

I'm trying to get a grasp on what my true identity really is, and it feels like I'm some sort of all-loving whore queen, who can't be allowed to exist. A queen bee that loves and fucks her entire hive. (I know this isn't exactly how bees work)

But I've settled for a quiet life indoors with one person and it hurts me in a way I can't entirely understand. I guess I'm just looking for insight."
1713,Any tips about tomorrow?,"I’ve decided to join a martial art school to improve my self defense ability .However I’m super nervous because I’m obliged to train with a random that would be skilled , and I don’t want to embarrass myself .

1715,Insecurity and past traumas make me always worried people will leave me,"Between my mom leaving me at 16, some unfaithful partners in my past, &amp; overall not finding myself worth while or good in any way. I constantly have anxiety about my bf or few close friends ditching me for someone better.
If my own mother could up &amp; leave then how could I expect anyone else to stay?
I don’t feel pretty enough to keep anyone around bc there is always someone better.
I don’t have a special unique quality that would keep people around. 
I don’t know what I offer.

It’s not exactly like my bf or others have made me feel like they might leave or I’m not worthy, I just feel this way all on my own. I can’t shake the fear. it makes me overthink so much so that I can convince myself they’ll leave even with no actual evidence. 

I don’t want to project these fears into my loved ones. I don’t want to push them away by needing their reassurance. But I don’t know how to stop feeling like this. 

I don’t know how to feel good enough that people won’t leave me. I don’t believe there isn’t something wrong with me."

Do any of you avoid being too close to people because you are afraid they will get too attached and become emotionally dependent on you?"
1718,How do I approach my roommate who uses their mental health as an excuse for their poor behaviour?,"It comes up in conflicts and just everyday conversations. I never want to push aside someone's mental health, but the way that she brings up her anxiety is tactical. As someone who struggles with their mental health, and is extremely aware of others' mental health, it's frustrating that she only brings it up when she needs an excuse, or when she is looking for pity. She has said and done things that directly attack my character, and when I call her out for it, she says ""sorry, it's just my anxiety that makes me think that"".

I could get into the finer details about this, but I'm mostly just looking for ways to respond to her when it happens. It's manipulative and makes her think that she is justified in her poor actions. I'm worried that when I do speak out about it, I'm going to do it in a very aggressive way and invalidate her mental health at the same time.

What are some healthy ways to discuss this?"
1719,feel like a burden,"i’ve been contemplating suicide for ages since age 15, i’m now almost 18 and during this period i have been the most unproductive, incompetent person ever, i just feel like such a waste of resources i don’t even know what to do"
1720,Should I be worried?,"( english is not my first language , i’m sorry for any grammar mistakes )
My stepdad was ( still is ) physically abusing my mother , not all the time , only when he is angry . Anyway , that’s not why I’m posting this . The whole thing started years ago so I got used to it but for a long time I started feeling really scared , not for me , but for her . 

When they are both in the kitchen I open my door , trying to listen what they say , hoping that they wouldn’t start fighting . When I hear their voices louder than before I freeze and can’t stop worrying about them fighting .

When they are coming back from work my chest is heavy and I start shaking . For a few days now I cried every day even if nothing happened . ( They are not fighting every day or every week but when it does it’s really bad )

He’s pretty jealous so when my mom’s phone rings more than two times and she doesn’t answer I start worrying because when she doesn’t answer he gets mad so I need to find her and give her phone . I’m just really scared but I don’t know why my chest feels heavy and why I’m shaking and why I sometimes can’t breathe ."
1721,im just nothing at this point,I can't feel real i don't want to feel real i don't want to exist i'm pushing everyone away and i stopped talking to anyone who knew how i really feel AND I EVEN STOPPED MESSAGING MY GF I'M FYCKING BAD PERSON SHE'S PROBABLY HURT IM SO SELFISH I HATE MYSELF I HATE EVERYTHING
1722,I am dealing with a nameless feeling and a lot of confusion. Can someone explain what is happening? I don't know what to think anymore. Am I finally okay? (NSFW due to detailing; so a trigger warning).,"TW: Suicidal talks and depression. I just really want to know what happened.

I'll try to keep it reasonably lengthed and as concise as possible. I am 19F, my depression started in the fifth grade. Truly, I woke up one day and just had trouble focusing on the test I had that day. I could barely read and comprehend even the simplest of words. I got that test back and it was a C. The first C I ever got. I was always a straight A student that the teachers adored. So that crushed me, and I had a thought that said exactly ""Guess you aren't that smart after all,"" and it spiraled from there. I dealt with severe depression where I would lay in bed all day. I wouldn't brush my teeth. I wouldn't shower. Wouldn't go out. I had constant, uncontrollable thoughts criticizing my every move and I was EXTREMELY suicidal. Constant thoughts of harming myself in any way. My chest and heart physically ached from the sadness I had. Bad anxiety and social anxiety.

I didn't get medicated help until I was 15. Paxil was the first try. Made things worse. I was put on Zoloft which just made me have less mood swings. But after 6 months, it was clear it wasn't working. I voiced my difficulty reading and concentrating. He said perhaps I had ADD, and put me on Adderall.

Adderall immediately perked me up. I was finally able to read again. I picked it back up as a hobby because from 3rd to 4th grade before all this started I loved reading. 

But, when I would crash after the Adderall it would hit me hard. I was still suicidal, but in a casual way. I would never actively attempt, but it was one of those situations where if a truck was about to hit me I would make no effort to move away.

Told my doctor. Changed Zoloft to Viibryd. I had terrifying, intense dreams. I felt everything. The pain. It was so real that when I would wake up I didn't know if I actually did or not. Trazodone was added to the mix to help me sleep at night and get rid of the vivid dreaming. It worked, but barely did anything to my depression and feelings of worthlessness. I started hallucinating and hearing voices telling me to kill myself. I knew they were not real, but it was stressful nonetheless. I had intense feelings of paranoia.

I had a mental breakdown in my GP's office so my parents finally gave in and took me to a psychiatrist.

I was immediately diagnosed with psychotic depression. My psychiatrist whiplashed me and completely changed my meds off. Took me off the Adderall and gave me Prozac and Abilify. Also a huge list of fucking vitamins and told me to drink Premier protein shakes three times a day. They are a lot of vitamins, but if anyone is interested I can tell you everything I took. I should note that I quit that Adderall cold turkey without any withdrawls.

I was desperate and I followed his advice, even though it felt so stupid. He also genetic tested me. I wouldn't get these results until later, but I will just tell them to you know: I have an altered COMT function which means I don't metabolize adrenaline well. Which is further justification for taking me off of the Adderall. I also had something else going on and was prescribed Deplin; which is a methylfolate that is a medical food that is suppose to make the antidepressant work better. This is all important to know for later.

I didn't like the psychiatrist but I followed what he said regardless. They just drug tested me every damn time and when I just couldnt piss they accused me of taking drugs or something, which was causing my hallucinating. At this point, the hallucinations and voices stopped. The Abilify was working. But, it started making me feel like my muscles were burning constantly. Like if I didn't move, the energy would pent up and it was extremely uncomfortable. It made it impossible to sleep. They called it akathisia. There was no relief. It was honestly the most tortuous thing I had ever experienced. They put me on Cogentin twice a day and it stopped, just like that.

Problem was, I had absolutely no energy or will to do anything. The depression, miraculously, was getting better. I did not feel as suicidal. Eventually, it stopped completely. I didn't feel ""right"", but I didn't want to die anymore. This carried on for about four months.

That's when the panic attacks started. The overthinking was still there. I was prescribed Xanax and treated like a drug seeker while the PA put in the order. I didn't ask for it by name. I took it once when I felt a panic attack coming on and it made me feel like absolute shit. I cut it in half for the next time and the same thing happened. I felt so bad and it knocked me out. I woke up so jet lagged and groggy and physically ill that I thought it better to just suffer through the chest pains of a panic attack the next time it happens.

I was in surgical tech clinicals at this time and I could not do anything. I was so anxiety ridden and falling behind. I got depressed again and consequently stopped taking my meds. I stopped them all. The Prozac, the Abilify, the Cogentin, and the Deplin and all the vitamins. I felt like nothing was working. I do want to note though that while I still didn't feel ""right"", I wouldn't say I was depressed and I was definitely NOT suicidal.

I saw my Adderall on the shelf and decided that fuck it, it helped me before, maybe just THIS is all I need. I decided that next week on my clinical day I'll take 10mg in the morning and just see what happens. I have nothing else to lose. 

The day went smoothly. I did a bunch of surgeries really well. The invasive and self-critique and low self esteem melted away. I was able to think properly and focus. I know that Adderall makes you do that, but this was the first time I felt normal in almost 8 years. I could confidently say I had a great day.

&amp;#x200B;

And just like that, everything has stopped. It has been about two weeks now. I feel normal. I am not depressed. I am not suicidal. I am not anxious. I have just been taking my Adderall that I had left over. I went back to my GP and explained everything. He said that I know what helps me and if this helps, then he will support me through it. I got another Adderall prescription. I have not told my psychiatrist yet. I have an appointment with the PA in about two weeks. I still have abandoned all my medications and I have been just taking my Adderall.

I can confidently say that I am very content with life and I am happy. I feel like I can do school again and my dreams of being a medical doctor may come true if I work hard enough. I look forward to life. I can 100% with confidence say that in the 8 years this has happened.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a source of depression, but I still cannot help but have a bit of a disturbing feeling in the back of my mind. What happened? Why has it stopped all of a sudden? Will it come back? It doesn't feel like it will. Was Adderall all I needed? Did I even have depression in the first place, or was it just ADD? Did having the Zoloft with the Adderall really cause that many issues? Sometimes, I wonder, what if I was just prescribed Adderall?

I know you're not suppose to just stop meds without telling your doctor. But I did, and I'm glad I am. I no longer have weird thoughts or moments of brain fog that the Abilify gave me or the moments of uncomfortable mania and racing thoughts Prozac would give me.

I am confused as to what happened. Did I get better? Is this what healing feels like? It feels good, but something just feels off.. or does it feel off only because I haven't known what normal feels like in so long?

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to add that there was no childhood trauma. My depression seemed to come out of thin air.

&amp;#x200B;

Reading back, I don't even know really what I am asking here. I just feel good but in retrospect I am just so confused. It started in a flash, and now its ending in a flash. Does anyone know what the hell happened? Am I going to be okay? Can I finally close this chapter in my life?"
1723,Idk if this post belongs here but help pls,"I really didn’t know where else to post this I hope I’m allowed to here.. also idk why I find this rlly embarrassing

I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...

I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....

1726,Black lives matter,"There are people who check out of politics because they do not think certain matters affect them and that the news is overwhelming. It is awful to watch terrible things happen to others but the ability to check out is a privilege afforded by certain people in the mental health community. If you check out over the generations of exploitation and dehumanization of the black community, it is morally wrong. Do not check out because of mental illness and being overwhelmed, there are so many ways to fight against injustice. Educate yourself and find ways to participate. 
It is argued that not everyone has the mental capacity to get involved. That it seems people are asking others to engage in behavior which will induce panic attacks, depressive episodes, flashbacks, etc. That some people can’t do this right now. 
We are not guilting you into certain situations when we are highly vulnerable already. However, this is a movement, and not a moment. Everyone can partake in anti-racist work. There are ways to get involved that do not trigger these things, it is important not to opt-out."
1727,Can someone categorize this mental illness?,"This is going to sound weird, but I’ve been doing this odd this for the past 5 years or so. It’s like I have these visions of some other universe and make up an imaginary world in my head and I pace back and forth around the house, literally running around for no reason. Sometimes I listen to music while doing it but it’s not dancing. I just pace and pace for hours, back and forth, in my little dream world. Then I’ll stop for a few hours, but the urge comes back again. I only do it at home, never in public. That’s the only time I feel that I can control it. It’s like this itch that I can’t resist. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? I’m 19 y/o by the way. I’ve been bullied my entire life and lived in a toxic household, so maybe that’ll provide some context."

But when he saw me shaking, he hugged me and pat my back until I felt better. When we went to sleep, I thanked him for helping me and he said that he cared about he and wants me to be happy.

1731,Does anyone get breathing anxiety?,"I don't get this much anymore, but I'll do my best to describe it.

When I was in middle school and my early stages of high school, I had a lot of anxiety and panic attacks over my breathing. I would think about whether I was breathing too loudly, start to obsess over it, and then because I was having a panic attack it was a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy where *everyone* I would actually start breathing too heavily. It sounds very strange but I did want to name it and wonder if anyone else went through this. Maybe it was just stuff I was going through at home at the time but I just don't know if anyone else has gone through this kind of breathing anxiety."

At the age of 21 I feel like I’ve peaked. I’ve upset all my friends so much they ran. I just can’t find it in me to take that final step. I don’t know what’s stopping me, I just wish it wasn’t. I’m sorry if I upset anyone, I’m sorry if I’ve failed anyone’s expectations. I’m worthless."

1736,"I wrote this last night while I was blackout drunk and kinda depressed, thought I'd share it here","I'm sitting here on a lone Saturday night, a little brokenhearted.

Companionship and love is all I seek. My veins bulge with blood that burns red with desire. Alcohol fills my already intoxicating body as I fall to pieces. Black.

Black is everything that I see. Here. Now. I wish that things could go back to the way they were before, however I know that's not possible. I have to try to make something out of my life and my situation, as hard as it may be.

Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I got into a relationship, just a small one. One that could simply ease my craving for one. Yeah, that should be enough. I'll just get into a SMALL relationship. Yeah, that'll work. That's perfect.

My lips crave for another pair like my lungs crave smoke-filled air.

I just want to be happy. Truly happy. Not fake happy, which is what most people are. Most people fake a smile because that's what they're taught. Fuck that.

Fuck faking it 'till you make it. 

I think I fall in love too quickly. I think that's part of it. For some reason, my heart wants to skip all of the bullshit and go straight to the point. That's not healthy. I'm not healthy.

Alcohol may help, or maybe not. Drugs may help, or maybe not. It's all chance. All a game.

My lips crave for another pair like my lungs crave smoke-filled air. What is love?"
1737,Residential Therapy?,Has anyone ever done residential therapy? If so how was it? I’m planning to admit myself into residential pretty soon because I keep getting lower and lower mentally
1738,I'm done,I just wanna die might kill myself later becuz I'm having a panic attack and no one seems to care idk if I can keep dealing with trauma and shit I just wanna fkon die
1739,i don’t know what i’m feeling,"hi i dont really know what to say but i feel like im trapped completely, not just in my body but in the world. i’ve persuaded myself that nothing is real as it seems (im finding this hard to explain) and i trust literally no one anymore. my mind seems like the only thing i actually have now and i cant connect to anything else. everything in life seems so trivial and i just want to be gone. i used to care so much about grades and my image and my old hobbies but it feels stupid now to even care that much about myself because what do i even get at the end. whats the point in any of it ? im so scared of death because i hate being in pain and i feel like i could have a heart attack any second. like i genuinely am so scared of just keeling over and dying, which is irrational considering how much i hate it here. i just feel so unsafe even in my own home around my family who im supposed to love. i’d like to think there are other people who feel in a similar way but im starting to lose hope of that in my mind too. idk what i will achieve by writing this but im very very scared right now. this probably sounds so stupid but i just need to know if anyone else feels the same please"
1740,I am lonely and I don't know what to do.,"I am very lonely. It keeps me up at night. It distracts me from studying. It's all I can think about. Last summer I ended my friendship with my only friend of 7 years, because it became very toxic and frankly, I started hating her. Having that kind of relationship, I never cared to meet other people. I was very comfortable with her. We had our own thing. We were happy. We spoke in English all the time instead of our native language. The seventh year, we were constantly fighting, it became very tough to be friends, and I thought it was time to let it go.

 Incidentally, right around then, I reconnected with someone I met in middle school; Emily. We were going to the same middle school and turns out we were going to the same college. We started hanging out. I was very excited. I fell in love with her. In college, we formed a group of friends. I was very pleased with the way things turned out. I thought, I finally belonged. But where she could make everyone laugh and spill their deepest darkest secrets, I found I was unable to reach out and build deep meaningful connections like that. My relationships with the rest of the group were platonic. I realised that I was unable to be funny or smart while looking someone in their judgmental eye. But I could be those things when texting in the group chat. And it's something they noticed. So every time I'd get past that mental block and make a joke, someone would say oh look she has a sense of humor. The thing is, because for seven years, I only communicated with one human being in a totally different language than to the one these people spoke, I didn't know how to reach out to them. I didn't know what made them laugh, I didn't know half the words they used.. 
Sometimes we'd all be sitting together and they will be so excited with one another, joking around, being affectionate.. and I'd join in, I'd try to be part of the conversation, but I'd get ignored. Not because they are bad people, but because I have nothing interesting to offer and at some point, people are gonna stop caring. So I retreated onto myself. This new discovery has made me very sad; it was eating me up and I couldnt express to them why I wasn't so jovial anymore. I felt the wedge between us, starting to take place. 
 With coronavirus, I lost contact with them completely. I tried to keep my relationship with Emily afloat. I'd video call, once in a while, always sending Instagram memes. But it felt like she wasn't interested anymore. On video call, right around the 3min mark, she'd tell me 'hey, my mom needs me. I'll call you back later' but then she'd never call back. When I stopped sharing memes, I realized I was harassing her with all these messages when she would just leave me on read.
 The fact, that no one cared, no one wanted to know how I was, made me miserable. I tried to accept the fact that I was alone and there is nothing wrong with that. I'd find someone, at some point, right? But it's been a month and I am still sad and lonely (cringe but it is what it is). I am suffocating. I want to cry, but the tears won't come. I want to fix my friendships but I can't change the fact that I am boring. I want new friends but I don't know where to meet people and how. I want to drink myself into oblivion but in my family alcohol is a sin and I don't know how to go behind their backs. I want help. I want to be able to understand them and to speak their language. I don't know how to do that. Especially, when they lose interest so quickly."
1741,How to make myself anxious/nervous voluntary?,"I am studying my emotions and my random anxiety/nervousness/fear comes at random moments in my life makes no sense. I want to understand it by making myself anxious voluntary and stopping this anxiety when I want to so that when it comes randomly I can stop it whenever I want. But in order for me to practice, I have to first start getting nervous/anxious. There is nothing in particular that makes me anxious, it just comes randomly, is there a way I can communicate my thought to make myself anxious so I can practice on stopping it? I just don't want it to comes in times WHEN I DON'T WANT IT TO COME or at least I will able to stop it if I have enough practice controlling right now."
1742,"I really, really hate myself and I don't know how to cope.","I betrayed the only person that cares for me, I know it wasn't 100% my fault but I can't stop hating myself for the decisions that led to the event. 

Also, a lot of people in my town HATE me and are spreading rumours about me, I never felt this disliked in my life, I don't even know how I'm going to show my face ever.

I just don't know what to do with myself, I can't do anything, I've been crying for 3 months now, all I want to do is lie in bed. I really hate me, I feel so much pain and it's not going away."
1743,How long will i feel mentally fried/exhausted?,"Hi, So for the last few months my Brain has been feeling super exhausted, It’s like a headache a mile headache.

I can’t think properly, I think a lot slower and I always second guess and make sure if like the words i’m using are correct or if the numbers are right. It’s not constant but I just have to start thinking of something and it totally fries my brain.

It’s really uncomfortable and it kinda scares me. 

Oh, Maybe it’s important to mention that i have severe anxiety, depression, ADHD, and autism."
1744,I’m not exactly sad but nor am I happy?,"These days I’m not exactly sad but nor am I happy. There’s days and times when I feel like the world is crashing in front of my face, I want to cry but tears just doesn’t come out because of how numb I feel and there’s days and times when I’m not really feeling sadness but nor am I happy. Does that mean my depression is better or I’m not exactly suffering from depression anymore? And sometimes I just wished that I should just continue feeling sad because that’s the only emotion I feel, at least I feel something like w human instead of feeling empty and nothing."
1745,Rough...,"At the end of my rope it seems.

I'd be lying if I havent considered extreme measures but I think a lot of people have. I dont want this to be about that but just want somewhere to let this all out. Dont even know why I'm doing this.

My mother was murdered last november. It was a day after I applied for a job back home a few states over. My mom was always really the only family member in my life with any sense of consistency or really the only person in my life I could call when I felt like I do now and she knew exactly what to say or do to make it all better. She was also the only family member we had within 1600 miles. Also why i applied to a job back home. I got the job in the midst of dealing with all of this, which was probably the best and worst possible thing having to explain my situation to people at work or why I sounded like I was a mess to multiple people. My company took good care of me. Allowed me a paid month off, paid for all my families stuff to be moved across the country, gave me relocation assistance ect. While all that is great I feel now it probably wasn't the best. Right after all of this I had no time really to let it out...between moving, leases, packing, and everything else involved with a cross country move I had no time to stop. My uncle and grandma came out to help with things, help with my son... but they left and I flew my other half out with my son and stayed behind to handle all the arrangements. Didnt really have time to grieve. 

Arrived at my new location living with in laws for a while. Planned to get our own place soon after saving up and paying off cards. All is well, new location of work isnt the most ideal I'll admit but being near family in this time helped a lot. Still really no time to grieve. Then covid. Being stuck at in laws now for a good while longer than expected after living on my own for 10 years probably didnt help the situation. Bottling up all my emotions for so long caused me to start being abrasive when I'm naturally a butterfly type personality. Friction between me and the other half started to get bad. Work peers not having the same outlook on things also added more stress due to them practically abusing employees verbally when I have more of an empowering mindset. That added more to home stress. Ontop of my mom, covid, the world. All while I just bottled it up....

We decided to take time apart and for me to stay with my grandma for a while. Who knows... this could be permanent. Not being together anymore, not being with someone I've spent the majority of my adult life with that I love. I'm to blame for that, I get it. I should of sought out help. I should of done more to let it out. I shouldnt of let it consume me or alter my being and allow me to take it out on my other half. Never the yelling type or god forbid the abusive type but really just shut down and shut out. Kindof just felt like I got to a point where little things upset me more than they should have and I didn't have the capacity to respond normally. No excuse.


Really don't know why I'm here writing this but I feel I just need to get it out. I guess i just feel like there really isnt much more that could go wrong. I lost my mom who really was the only family member I had any connection with. Really the only one my son had a connection with. Had to push all that down. Moved to a new area. New job. Now lost my family really. And ofcourse as I'm writing this my sciatic nerve left me immobilized the past two days. I just wish I could go back to last October for a day so I can not feel this way for just a day. 

I just dont know what to do anymore. I've contemplated just driving and not stopping just to clear my head. I've contemplated other things but I wouldn't do that even more so because my son needs his dad. I just dont know. I dont think I can live without my son and his mom in my life after all this. Feel like that really just was a kick when I was down but I'm to blame. 

Ugh."
1746,yes im not ok,"numb isnt ok, self harm isnt ok, thinking about dying almost every single second of every single day is not ok. but even though they insult me and ignored my coming out my parents are so ""perfect"" and ""never ask me to do anything"". i dont  like hugs or people touching my arms from anyone but im not aloud say that because its ""insulting"" to my mother. i get money if i ask and dont have to do a lot but that doesnt make them good parents. they have to order all my stuff and rip it open the second its through the door. i would literally do all the housework if they would just be accepting and nice. but thats to much to ask because me being myself is ""trying to be different"" or ""not special"". i dont want to be special i want to be happy."
1747,So I’m wondering if anyone else experiences this,"So this has been happening since I was a child but it hasn’t happened for years till last night. Out of nowhere with no apparent trigger l, every single thought in my head and anything I hear anyone say sounds like shouting. It’s not like I’m hearing voices or anything it’s just my thoughts not even like intrusive thoughts or anything. This is also paired with a white noise in the background like last night there was buzzing and then there was a sound like a laser gun shooting over and over. I can’t manually make it quieter or go away and it leads to like a sensory overload where any sounds inside or outside my head is super loud and overwhelming. It lasted for like half an hour and then slowly died away. I looked online and I couldn’t find anything that wasn’t about hearing voices or stuff like that."
1748,"Things are ""Going Well"" in my Life but my childhood trauma and abusive previous marriage are stones in my pockets.","26 Year old Woman here. Divorced for a year. I finally left my emotionally and verbally abusive husband after 2 years of intermittent hell. I have a Bachelor's degree and am working toward my Master's. 2 weeks ago I received a job offer that is my ideal fit. I am moving into an apartment in a week (after staying with a relative in a new state after leaving my ex). The things that I want are finally happening.

And yet, I still feel such an immense self-hatred and inferiority. I was abused and neglected as a child. My parents died and I was left with an aunt and uncle who were fucked up in many ways. 

I exercise. I eat relatively healthily. My friends are great.  I am ""doing"" everything I know to make myself better and try to get to a place where I ""love"" myself. Whatever the hell that means. Sometimes I just want to jump off a bridge though because I hate this person that I am so much. ""Not smart enough, beautiful enough, creative/wealthy/ambitious/sexy  enough."" My brain goes on rants, as many of you are probably familiar with.

1749,I’m not sure how to create an intriguing title atm.,"I feel like garbage. I’ve never been more depressed in my entire life. 
I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for nearly a decade now, started when i was a preteen. 
I have never been able to get over it. I’ve been to counsellors, taken medication, tried being more social, and all it’s done is make me feel like things are never going to get better. 
I didn’t have a plan after high school or something I aspired to do for my career because I never thought I would get that far in life. 
My life has sucked. I’ve always thought of myself as super ugly and unlikable but a lot of people over the years don’t understand why I feel these things about myself. 
My boyfriend especially doesn’t understand why I don’t think I’m a ‘bombshell’, but I can’t help what I think when I look in a mirror. I avoided mirrors for years, actually, more specifically I avoided any reflective surface. It got to a point where I was stupid good at it. If I had to look in a mirror at an appointment where I had to see if glasses looked okay on me, for example, I would do this thing with my eyes where I would ‘haze’ over my vision so all I saw was a blur of my face. 
Now I can’t even go into a store and purchase/order something because my anxiety is soooo high. All I think in my head is that people are thinking I’m hideous or stupid or annoying. 
I’m mainly worried about ruining things with my current boyfriend over my insecurities. I truly do feel like I’m dumb, ugly, and will never be successful or happy. 
I don’t have enough guts to do anything permanent, but sometimes I would just love to be someone else... anyone really aside from me."

I could never kill myself now.

1752,"Lazy Fishing , good way to be entertained","Hello 

I have been fishing for about 3 years now. I guess this would be a 'wellness' post according to the sidebar. The reason I am making this post is because I am describing a low-cost solo activity that makes being by yourself exciting, at least for me, and figure I might as well share it with you redditors who might be seeking such an experience. It's not as boring as it looks and I'll try to convey this thought.

Recently I have gotten into what I call lazy fishing, which I define as fishing where you're not actively reeling in your bait/lure. Instead, you toss it out once and then wait for the fish to come and take it. It's strategic (will explain).

The main lazy fish is called a 'common carp'. It is like a goldfish but larger, with weights in the 10-30 pound range (like 5-14 kilograms). Almost every freshwater pond, lake, or river should hold carp. (I target 'common carp') 

**What you can expect:** you waiting patiently for up to several hours for a fish, depending on how heavily targeted they are where you're fishing. Some ponds that I have been to, I will get a fish in 5 minutes. The fish will fight for several minutes. 

**How:**  Carp stir up the muck on the bottom, releasing trapped air bubbles to the surface which is an indication that they are feeding. Spot those bubbles and a carp is nearby. Those bubbles will remain on the surface for several seconds, good to know (not all bubbles are carp bubbles). 

What you do is you take *canned sweet corn*, should cost less than a dollar for a can. Carp eat from the bottom so you toss a handful of corn out, then you wait for them to detect the corn on the bottom and start feeding on it. Your fishing setup is just a small circular hook with a weight attached maybe 20 cm away from the hook. If there is interest in the comments I will be more clear with the setup. 

I can suggest a fishing rod/more info in the comments if there's interest, I am just trying to introduce the concept.

Also imagine a fishing rod, if u havent used one, the fish pulls the line and theres a knob which adjusts how easily they can pull line (called 'drag'), you need to set it very loose meaning that a very small force will let loose line, if its too tight then the carp will run off with your entire rod in a matter of seconds. 

 This is a good way to collect your thoughts and also when the fish gently inhales the corn (they suck from the ground, it is really easy to unhook and carp dont have any spikes or teeth) they start moving away with it slowly, not thinking its a trap, and then when the line goes tight due to the tension between the weight u put on the line and the carps movement with the hook) the carp which is a very cautious fish bolts. If you were to tighten the 'drag' as it is called then the carps strength would be too great and your line would snap. It happens pretty often to me but the line is cheap. 

You also get an adrenaline rush from this. It's like anticipation anticipation then you see your rod which you laid down next to you twitch and the line bounce, and then you have to quickly grab the rod and lift it upward while the fish runs. I could have organized this better. Anyways with carp fishing it's unpredictable, if anyone is interested *ask questions in the comments and I'll give more info*. I definitely missed some parts.

Have a good day"
1753,I dont know what to do,"Hi i'm a 19 year old male (turning 20 on the 14th) and at this point i'm reaching the end of myself.

This specifically regards my parents and family situation but its helpful that I lay down some framework for more help..

When I was younger I absolutely adored my mom. I relied on her for everything emotionally almost to a detriment. (My dad is still here and in the picture but I never really had a relationship with him due to the both of us being extremely different people, which usually resulted in fights and distancing myself from him) But most of those feelings changed once I found out I was gay (My whole family is extremely religious). I discretely asked my mother what she would do if she found out I was gay and she just outright said that she would ""pray for me"" and I found out later on once I turned 18 most likely kicked me out (its not entirely relevant to the problem i'm having so i'm going to leave it out to not make this longer than it needs to be).

After this I became as emotionally distant from her I could possibly be. Things got a little weird though when I tried coping with the situation with really weird situations I made up in my head. The gist of the situations would be me finding out I was adopted, or finding out that they had hated me from birth. Basically anything to not accept the truth that she would never love me for who I was. 

I've mostly been able to not think about her basically disowning me but I've noticed that i've been using said coping mechanism (making up scenarios to justify things) for other aspects of life, such as my friends. This has been making me unintentionally distance myself from them and i've been losing sleep thinking ""what if these were real? what if they were just lying so they can find something to use against me?"".

I really don't know what to do at this point. To an extent I do know that my friends care about me and want me to be happy in life but there is always this voice that keeps coming when i'm in bed telling me What ifs/They're lying and i' m getting sick of it"
1754,Does anybody else get an overwhelming desire to give up in the face of a large task?,When I try to start a task or project I get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work that still has to be done and I just feel hopeless and exhausted. Sometimes even washing the dishes is too much for me.

1756,How to Get Help,"I’ve always had bad mental health like depression and anxiety. Lately it’s been so bad it’s hard to get up and do stuff, I even quit my job because it’s just so hard to focus. I want to seek help and I want a diagnosis on what’s wrong with me. My friends said you can schedule a visit with your primary care physician to get an assessment but I don’t know how to do that. Like, my main question is when I’m scheduling my appointment online how do I say that’s what I want? Do I just put “I’m looking for a mental health assessment and possibly a psychiatrist referral?” Also what types of questions will they ask me in person at the doctors office? I cry super easy, like at the drop of a hat, so I’d like to be able to write down as much as I can beforehand but I don’t know what they’ll ask. Thank you so much for any help ❤️❤️"
1757,"Adult sibling is mentally ill, horrible with money, extremely codependent, and it's affecting my own mental health","To start off, I already have depression and anxiety issues, so baseline I'm not too well-off as it is.

I'm in my late 30s. My sister is in her early-mid 30s. We are very close in a sense, although a lot of that is due to her being very dependent on me for support.  She had a rough childhood and went through some trauma. Problem is she never got it properly treated. She went off to college right out of high school and has been financially and emotionally dependent on my parents to some degree every day since then. My parents have never been good at dealing with her issues, and I blame them for not putting their foot down immediately, nipping it in the bud and telling her she needs to commit to long-term treatment/medications or she's cut off from their support. She pulls every excuse out of the book for why she won't/can't/doesn't want to/it's pointless/etc, and my parents give in. If my parents even begin to push back, my sister has a meltdown, yells, screams, fights, and tacitly implies that she will spiral and become suicidal. Consciously or subconsciously, she has learned to leverage her mental health issues, her suicidality, and the misery she can inflict on them to get what she wants

That has led to her being able to manage living in 12-5 different $1500-2000/month apartments in various expensive cities over the past decade and a half while almost never being employed full-time. She also does much of her grocery shopping at Whole Foods. Just to give you an idea of her relationship with money. She also relies on students loans- she's been in school most of her adult life and has a staggering, perverse amount of student debt.

Anyway, now that our parents are old, broke, and mentally broken, she's been turning to me more and more not just for emotional support (such as constant woe-is-me, I'm feeling so suicidal texts), but for financial support as well. Not nearly to the point that she's relied on our parents, but still too much. Any amount is too much. She's in school (again) with no job and no money and lives in an apartment that is much nicer than my own, as well as driving a nicer car (she came up with what I know is a bullshit excuse about it being the only car she could get), several new-ish Apple products, still shopping at Whole Foods, and so on. There's always some reason, some rationale, some excuse for why she can't do without them. She can't find a cheaper apartment because of \[insert bullshit excuses\]. She is just so divorced from reality, so emotionally fragile, and so obstinate that there is no getting through to her about it. I can kind of see why my parents have put up with it all these years. There is the unspoken but always present understanding that if you try to put her in her place, it will results in her spiraling and eventually us calling the cops because she's suicidal. It is a living hell dealing with her problems.

That isn't to say that she doesn't have very real, legitimate problems (health etc) that would be miserable for anyone to deal with, but she almost always refuses to make good faith efforts to deal with them herself. We're also convinced that some of her health problems are at least in part due to the immense stress she puts on herself from creating problems out of nothing through horrifically bad decision making. Instead she just inundates us with texts and calls about how miserable her life is,  constantly fights on the phone with our mother over crap that she should be dealing with on her own like an adult, and every time I get a text or my phone rings I get a pit in my stomach and my anxiety skyrockets. Sometimes I swear I would be much happier if she just disappeared completely out of my life for 5 years and reappeared as a normal, happy, well-adjusted *adult*.

How do you deal with a person like this? I'm coming close to telling her to just fuck off, but if she felt abandoned by me of all people, things would get worse than they've ever been and it would put our family through a hell that we just can't cope with. Talking to my parents about this is useless because they'e better at enabling her problems than they are at effectively dealing with them. I'm really at a loss."

Sometimes when texting or talking I have to fear to say or to accidentally write and send something I don’t want, So I check the texts multiple times (Happens with homeworks, documents and etc...).

Everythings gone downhill since I was 12.I was a strange infant rarely cried and always messed with wires and figuring things out.When I was about 2 I lived with this woman and she hated my dad so much that she'd take out this anger onto me since I looked like my dad.Hitting me,throwing me into dark rooms for hours for a whole year I endured this.

After a while my dad came back and took me but left my sister since my mother gave her legal guardianship to my sister and not me.
Things were the same I was hit by strangers I moved with my dad from house to house with his friends.after a while my mom came back into the country

But it didn't change I was used to this though while I didn't understand at the time.I knew I was misbehaving but they would hit me,if I would upset I would be told to ""fix my face"" if I got yelled at I was told to stop or they'd ""give me a real reason to cry"". Since my dad was a truck driver we were pretty poor I would be made fun of because I always wore big jeans and shirts so I could grow into them.

I got an Xbox as a gift but I could never use it either because we didn't have batteries or they couldn't afford a game.I'd spend hours in my room by myself sitting watching tv.I'm gifted as some would say always was a straight A student in elementary but people didn't know it was because if I even dropped to a 89 I'd be screamed at.

They'd accuse me of being lazy or not try.I never could go play with friends.I wouldn't be allowed out of their sight.I stopped feeling when I was in 5th I didn't care anymore and that's how I was until I got to middle school.

I had a complete mental shut down and was diagnosed with depression.I was passed around by counslers and sent to a mental hospital 5 times 3 out patient 2 inpatient.I want to go back it kept me out of school but they said if I returned it'd go on my record.

I argued with my dad back and forth I don't speak to him anymore.I have a little brother but I can't be the big brother he expects me to be. I don't care for school,career paths,friendships,nothing.I can barely express emotions,I'm always called a hallow person or school shooter

The only things I have left are my video games I bought and my girlfriend,but I screwed that up too.I called cps on her parents because I thought they were abusing her from what she told me that her parents do to her.

But hey it doesn't matter does it I'm just another cog besides someone has it worse than me,right?"
1762,Confused mind,"sometimes I start to think in a very disturbing way for me, maybe this is normal but it bothers me a lot, it's like I have two lines of thought in which one is me ""normal"" and the other is me pessimistic and I only do things to harm myself, sometimes I can't tell when I'm not thinking normally or when I'm thinking a little confused, I wonder if anyone else feels that way."
1763,"I need some help, I guess..","So over the last few years I've been almost driven nuts by my own mind.
It used to happen every few months I guess, but recently that time frame is getting shorter and shorter ..
It starts with an absolute loss of appetite, as in the thought of food just doesn't appeal anymore, at all. Excessive smoking, even more than usual. And an over active hardcore disturbingly hideous thought generator just lights up in the back of my mind and won't, for the life of me, be turned off..
And to add insult to that, I can't seem to be able to cry, no matter how much I want to.
It's been years since I last let loose emotionally, because I literally can't afford to see a psychologist, I seriously can't.
Oh yeah, almost forgot, I seem to keep talking to imaginary people (or real ines who can't physically be here) semi-constantly, so yes there's that besides the thoughts of doom and gloom in my head.
Maybe by the tine I wake up tomorrow it would've passed this time  maybe not..

1764,Can a person with mental health problems who isn't in therapy establish a long-term friendship with someone?,I'm asking because I know I have some mental health issues (I can't specify on them since they're not officially diagnosed as of now). I had my first therapist appointment initially planned in mid April but they got canceled and I don't know when I'll be able to see a therapist again. I really need to at least try to make a friend online since I've had no friends in 13 years and I really feel I need a friend in times like these. I'm scared of being overwhelming or not being dedicated enough or even being undeserving of friendship.

1766,Feeling like I don't know myself anymore- is this “normal” given the circumstances?,"Some background (I'll try to keep it brief): I went through a really rough breakup about a year ago. My ex started getting resentful, overly-critical towards me, and pushing me away about 2 years into our relationship. I tried to put in more effort to show I cared because I thought thats what she wanted, but then she broke up with me. Apparently she was under the impression I was going to break up with her instead. She said we could be friends but continued to treat me poorly. Eventually I tried to confront her about how she had been treating me but she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. I snapped &amp; told her off and haven't spoken to her since. 

At this point I'm glad she's no longer in my life but it feels like my self-esteem has been put through a paper shredder. Most notably I feel like I'm not sure who I am any more. I question everything I do and I'm afraid I'm constantly being a jerk. I keep thinking about things she said like how I apparently “have problems perceiving reality” and “don't ever think about what message I'm sending to others.” Ironically she accused me of gaslighting her at one point when I'm pretty certain it was just a misunderstanding. She also claimed my apologies were just excuses and generally acted like she knew me better than I knew myself. Its like she kept trying to twist things around so I was the bad guy even though I only had good intentions, and now I can't stop questioning if I really am that terrible. 

I don't know. I've been considering therapy for a while but it feels like there's a lot of hoops to jump through, especially with the with the state of the world at the moment. I guess I'm just wondering if it's reasonable to feel  unsure of myself after all this?"
1767,I can’t rationalise my feelings.,"I don’t know what is normal and what isn’t, I struggle with relationships and friendships. I can’t talk to anyone about it/ I have a close friend but she doesn’t care when I bring it up. 

I always end up at the bottom of the social hierarchy, no matter what I do. I think I have autism. I don’t know when people are making fun of me/ being sarcastic/ I don’t know when and who to trust with what. 

I have tried various things, however I can’t keep up the act (even if it is successful initially) for long, I get super frustrated when I’m doing the act. I don’t think it is surprising or shocking that no one likes the “real” me but it blows me away how everyone seems to get on with each other so easily. I centrally don’t find it easy. 

I have friends, I think we are closer than we actually are though and this is something that gets me every time. I’d put them as my best friends but they would consider me on the edge of an acquaintance. 

Looking back there are many times I have overreacted to things although I don’t show it, all of my feelings and reactions are strictly private because I’m not sure if it is appropriate but I know it probably should be kept to myself. 

I feel I can’t share these feelings because We aren’t close enough and I feel it would push us apart more. I have tried many other ways spread out over time to improve things but have been unsuccessful, which impacts my self esteem greatly. 

I feel there is something wrong with me, like autism and a personality disorder. I have never been “normal” and the differences have become more defined as I have got older. 

Please does anyone else have experience of this, how did you handle it?"

The funny thing is, sometimes by the end of the day I’m a beacon of positivity, and I get in bed feeling rather neutral about my day. I’ve been told that this behavior isn’t bipolar since the changes happen to fast, so what do you guys think? My only lifeline during the suicidal episodes is “x will be sad”"
1772,Share your story with psychiatric medication.,"[M25]

I've been doing therapy for 3-4 months now and my therapist is heavily recommending me to jump into medication for anxiety and depression. 

I'm suffering from severe depression and a long history of personal / family issues that brought me deep consequences on adult life. After going through so much, I'm on the verge of giving up.

I'd like to hear from you guys how medication helped you in actually solving your issues / giving you some hope.

Thanks."
1773,"What makes something distorted or unhelpful thinking, rather than merely sounding unrealistic or improbable?","This is a lot based on my own experiences with how not helpful therapy was for abuse.  I learned the templates for what a cognitive distortion looks like, but it's pretty clear that thoughts with the same pattern *can* be true.  And there didn't seem to be any real coherent way to tell the two apart.

The abuse I experienced is highly unrealistic.  I find in telling the story that, unless I *deliberately* frame my narrative in a way that draws parallels to more conventional abuse narratives, that the primary responses tend to be disbelief.  Something along the lines of ""that's bizarre"" or ""that can't be right"".  It's very common also to have other people try to retell or reframe my story in a way that seems to make more sense, even if their reframing is inconsistent with my memory or other evidence.  Or to accuse me of leaving something else or not telling the whole truth because the story doesn't sound right.

I'd note here that ""unrealistic"" doesn't necessarily mean exceptionally horrific.  It just means that the story doesn't fit with what people expect abuse to look like or what most people would consider probable.  In my case I would say it's largely because there doesn't seem to be any sensible motivation behind the abuse; a calm, collected abuser who gains no apparent sexual pleasure or external benefits from the abuse simply doesn't make sense to most people.  It doesn't make sense to me either.

But at this point, now that I'm an adult and have had a number of years *away* from therapy, it becomes clear that the events I remember did actually happen.  I still don't really have a good idea why.  But I'm faced with the choice that I either somehow fabricated a significant number of memories leading up to age 19 or so, or that a woman I have witnessed as an adult being abusive to others and shows a significant tendency towards narcissism and inability to get along with anyone else did in fact do what I remember.

Getting to the point of being able to do that has taken an amazing amount of work though.  And it's work that therapy fought every step of the way, labeling it as my defense mechanisms making me think something was there.  Encouraging me to focus on the nice things that my mother did (so as to not be discounting the positive) and to take her assertions of intent to help me at face value (otherwise it would be mindreading).  Basically generally labeling the whole process of trying to figure out if there was actually something to these improbable and unrealistic thoughts, rather than simply dismissing them, as a defense mechanism and unwillingness to change.

The only answer I ever got to how you tell the difference is to check with other people.  But that is, quite frankly, a terrible answer in situations like mine.  And most therapists I've found would avoid answering the question while pushing you to find and identify any thoughts that sound like the examples as distorted.

So how do we actually tell, as therapy clients?  And how, in mental health treatment, do we ensure we're not simply labeling people with unrealistic sounding experiences or communication struggles as having distorted thinking?"
1774,How did you regain confidence? Going through a difficult depressive episode.,"I am really struggling with self-deprecation. I keep remembering back to my art student days where I loved making things, I loved being creative, I loved making art. Now I really struggle bringing myself to do anything (including non-art stuff), it's like I'm scared to see what I'll do. 

How did I love creating art so much to now feeling like I can't bring myself to make anything? Losing this love genuinely feels like I've lost a huge part of me because it really was. 

I am thinking a lot of it is down to lack of confidence, I just don't have any confidence in myself, or courage. But then, it never used to seem like courage to me, it used to be just me and just something I did.

If you have been in a position like this, how are you doing? And what have you found helps?

1775,I need control,"Hello
This whole thing is gonna be a mess, please understand I am writing this in a manic episode to attempt to make sense and find anyone who can understand anything I am trying to explain.




I am just a teen who lives in poverty in a household that drives me nuts as I'm untreated. I have diagnosed depression and PTSD, though they only figured that out after my last therapist brought up something my dad told her and I snapped at her. 

I always cover up what's really haunting me with a childhood trauma of mine. I was severely bullied for years and I had one dog that had been through it all with me. When my mom left us, after I was hospitalized, and when my first friend died. I went to my grandparents house in southern cali and that was the last time I ever saw her. I now live a life full of guilt for never saying goodbye and I always think that she must have been put down thinking I abandoned her like her last owner. It haunts me everyday and it's been five years. 

Back to where I say I use that to cover up my other trauma. I was the therapist friend to try to distract myself from my father's betrayal. In the process of being that friend, I now have the feeling of being a complete waste of a human because I couldn't save them no matter how hard I tried. I watched them die one by one. I  found three of their bodies and I now refuse to FaceTime people because the last person shot themselves on FaceTime because they thought that seeing them die and not be a burden to me would make me happier. I don't consider their act something they did for 'my sake', I've met people who think it meant good. I can't see how'd they'd ever think that. All of it was horrid and I myself am confused on how I still function and act like nothing wrong. Maybe it's because my current home says that people have it worse than me. Recently my best friend tried killing herself during class and I was never informed till I got a text weeks later saying they were back and on antidepressants. I was so confused and then I was hurt that all my friends wouldn't tell me. Their excuse was ""You already have enough hurt, I wouldn't want to add more. You seem stable now so it was best to wait"". Sorry if this whole post is a mess, but I'm having a really hard time coping and I'm very confused on how to function when my entire life feels like it's being controlled by my fear of reality."
1776,Dealing with stigmas &amp; oversaturation from society regarding your health problems,"[M-28]

Current Diagnoses &amp; years I have had/known about them:
Depression 10
ADHD 5
Aspergers (ASD) 5
Insomnia 11+
Migraines 11+
Teeth grinding 8
Fatigue 10

Now add several injuries from mostly poor genetics, overuse from work, &amp; sports including 5 surgeries (6 will happen later this year). Etc. 

Over time as I learned more about my problems I have adjusted several things I say or do to get by even though I am set up to lose. As I have tried to educate employers, family, peers, potential partners &amp; I have found that the initial understanding, empathy, acknowledgment whatever you want to call it have eventually faded into annoyance &amp; intolerance. 

Given the lack of general knowledge surrounding mental health &amp; some injuries especially when they aren't as obvious as a broken leg I've found that people now resent me for problems I had little control over. My health has left me in debt, limited my ability to work for weeks with the surgeries &amp; doing leisure activities yet I'm seen as 'soft' 'self loathing.' Is there a term for this experience with people who experience chronic issues &amp; people turn on you?"
1777,I havent went outside in 4 months and have played online games for at least 15 hours a day since then,"My mind feels really numb sometimes and even in my dreams in in video games,my nightmares are doing bad in online games sometimes I dont even feel like I'm alive anymore"
1778,I think there's something wrong with me but I don't know what,"I've always been a very quiet person, and I've never seen a doctor because of my mental health.


At school I was very shy and had only a few friends. I've been bullied a few times, but never been the most bullied kid in the class, I was very discreet and it didn't caught attention of my colleagues. I think I suffered the average amount of bullying for a boy during school.


Everything was fine at college, with few friends again.


I startet do work in my early 20s, and I feel that I'm become more socially awkward as I get older.


In my first job I started to feel that people were talking about me behind my back, about being a weird guy. And that was pretty bad to my self-esteem.


Now that I'm 30 and in my second job, it's been wonderful to be working from home because I can't stand my co-workers. They're always making fun of me and I pretend not to be upset. I must pretend very well because they keep going. Sometimes I make jokes as well, but it's nothing to make fun of somebody in particular. I don't know why they like to do that to me, when there are a lot of other people there. Maybe because I'm younger than them and I don't show that I'm upset.


The problem here is that I've been thinking that there's got to be something wrong with me to be perceived as a weirdo.


They even joked about me having autism one day. The only thing I know is that I'm extremely introverted and socially awkward.... and maybe it's not normal as I always thought.


what I hate the most about working from home are zoom meetings. I feel very uncomfortable being in front of a cam. At the beginning I kept it turned off, but every other person was using them and they started to encourage me to turn my camera on. In the next meetings I started to turn on my camera and I was starting to get used to it, but now I realized that they've been making fun of me, talking about my hair, the awkward faces I do during the meetings. And they talk about it in a group chat that I'm in. They don't ever do those kinds of stuff with anyone else, only me! Why me? I'm starting to believe that I am the problem.


If I said the same things about any of them, they'd probably laugh about it. That's why I don't blame them. They think they are just joking and that's ok, everyone is doing it.... 

I wish I wasn't so sensitive, some jokes from assholes are lowering my self-esteem and making me feel like shit. I'm trying to figure ouy what is my problem...

There was chanting, speeches made by the arrangers and everybody kept their distance to each other. After 40 minutes, this protest disbanded and I and the friend that went to this protest, tagged along with a impromptu march that happened.

For 2 hours, we walked peacefully and everything was lovely, but then a group of young boys decided to mess it all up. They shot fireworks at us, attacked a journalist and then the police. I tried to stop them but they wouldn't listen, and they called me whore for protecting the ""bad guys"". They were later on peppersprayed. I left because the protest turned violent and I wasn't there to be violent.

It seemed like groups of people took advantage of the situation, and started looting stores, breaking windows and fighting the police. All I can see on the news are titles like ""BLM protestors loot stores and attack police,"" etc.

I feel sad, mad and actually guilty. I can't sleep because I feel like if I hadn't gone maybe I could have changed things. Maybe there wouldn't have been a fight. I know it's impossible for me to be the cause of this, as it was an outside gang of people, not part of the protest, that attacked us and the police, but I still feel like it is my fault.

Please, I don't understand what's going on and I'm on the verge of tears, although I should be happy I made it out without injuries. I feel horrible and the guilt is overwhelming. Is this normal?

I then sometimes even get obsessive, constantly checking their online status and seeing when they were last active on social media. I come to the conclusion they’re avoiding me and hate me and don’t want to talk to me anymore. They then respond a few hours later and I get happy and excited and forget my sadness. If they continue to stop responding I then I’ll cry for awhile before eventually becoming angry/annoyed and saying they weren’t even worth it.

- basic tasks seem very taxing. trying to focus on sleeping / making at least 1 proper meal / showering but failing at all 3

- life goes on: so although i might need to allow myself / have no choice but to pause, external commitments continue to pile + i'm falling even further behind

I feel a lot more exhausted even though I’m getting 9 hours of sleep a night. Since I started taking depakote I’ve actually been getting around 12 hours of sleep including the day naps where I just fall asleep at my desk. Apart from that I feel this weird feeling like something is off or different. I can’t quite describe it though. I’m just wondering if anyone else who’s taken depakote also experienced any of this and has any advice?"
1798,Read this while it's not too late,"First of all, I'm a 17yo brazilian male so please don't expect any Shakespeare-ish english proficiency. Nonetheless I guess you'll be able to understand me well enough.

That said, here I write this as letter, nothing but an attempt to help me getting out of this shithole I mentally feel stuck in. Tbh I feel like I just need to talk but I wouldn't feel comfortable to talk this stuff to anyone of my family or friends right now. Matter of fact, I try to never talk bad stuff to them because I just don't like to bring negativity to the people that I want to be happy, since everyone has their own struggles too and I usually try to not give them more issues to worry about. I'll try not to make this too long so that y'all don't waste too much time reading this. 

Right now I probably feel the worst I've ever felt in my whole life. Maybe not the peak worst, but I'm probably at my mental edge right now (I'm not sure if I made this part clear, sorry but I can't put it in better words). As of now my eyes are dry though. I lost my mother 5 years ago, she died from cancer. That was the peak worst, even though she was already battling it for 6 years and I was kind of prepared for that moment to come someday. Still an atrocious loss for a 12yo kid. Me and my father just didn't really recover from that. In fact I guess I recovered better than him. My father is the man I admire than most on Earth, but right now he's destroying himself, that's reflecting on me and I don't know how to handle it. He has become an alcoholic. He started a small business 3 years ago and met this woman that is part of our family nowadays. I really like her. He does as well, but he can't love her as a wife as much as he loved my mom (they were together for 21 years). As I said, he still hasn't overcome my mothers passing and he drinks to try to feel better. But I don't even think he feels better anymore, it has actually turned into an addiction. He just feels this compulsive need to drink. There's another problem: his business is performing bad. Never went as good as he projected and we are broke right now. The covid fucked us up financially too (because of the lockdown people can't hire his services anymore), fortunately our family didn't get the virus yet. Also, he shares ownership of this business with his new wife. So what happens is that he drinks and then comes home to fight (not physically) with her for absolutely no reason. And I can't tolerate this anymore. I've been witnessing this for so many years. Ever since my mother discovered her cancer he's been acting like this. But when I was a kid there was nothing I could do. Nowadays I can intervene since I'm as big as him and I'm able to defend myself or her if necessary. But that sucks. That's literally something I find unacceptable. A son should never even consider the possibility of needing to fight his own father, specially when he loves him. I've already talked to him multiple times the day after that type of stuff happens (it's been happening weekly recently, some weeks even more than once). But he never acknowledges that he's sick, that he's become an addict and that he needs help before another tragedy happens. 

And now all that shit has made me sick. My stress rates are off the charts and I'm frequently having anxiety crises. I feel like I've become sort of a bitter person, and I feel alone at the same time that my behavior pushes people away from me. My mind is full of negative thoughts. These latest weeks I feel like I'm really at the edge. He's drunk right now and will come home later today. Everytime he drinks I've been progressively feeling worse, it's almost as if any day I'm having a heart attack or something like that. Hope it doesn't happen today because I still want to stay alive. 

Well, I probably would have more to say but this already is way too long. In fact I don't even know if someone will read this. If you read all of it please just type anything in the comments or upvote this post to let me know. If possible, give me your point of view on my current situation on the comment section. Thanks."
1799,I am in a nervous breakdown and can’t escape - PLEASE help,"I am really struggling. i am at a very very low point and although I know it is just a point and will Pass I cant see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I am under extreme stress and anxiety and in a bit of a depression. I feel so low, hopeless, overwhelmed, crushed and also infuriated. I am also feeling just so painfully lonely and isolated atm. I have gone through a few periods like this (exams, grieving deaths ect) before. However, I don’t think it has ever really been this bad. 

I have been having panick attacks and sometimes wake up in the middle of the night in this INTENSE panick or stress. I can’t breathe and have the overwhelming feeling I feel doomed and also kind of with these concentrated bouts of rage? Idk how to explain it. I also get into panick attacks while trying to work/finish a project ect. I have never really had panick attacks or anything like that before (just a couple of occasions).

My physical health is also taking a toll. I have always been very athletic but with being stuck inside and feeling like I don’t have time to excercise I feel weak and stagnant. 

I am quite a critical person sometimes and am very perfectionist in the sense that everything has to be perfect but this is mostly directed towards myself. I’ve always been like this but it usually ends up with hurting myself or just being distraught one way or another. (Omg this is getting so depressing lol sorry!) idk I just hate myself more than I could put into words right now. I hate myself physically and have gotten very body-dysmorphic this quarantine and also just hate me as a person. I feel utterly unlovable. I know I’m young but I would love a girlfriend/boyfriend but I don’t see how anyone could really love me. I want it so bad but don’t see it happenifn. I feel like a failure and like my friends find me annoying ect. I’ve kind of tried to reach out about my struggling but feel like a burden. How is everybody else doing so ok? 

I have always LOVED food and turn to it when stressed or sad but I have actually completely lost my appetite for the last month. This has never really happened to me. I feel lightheaded dizzy and nauseous all the time. Sometimes I can’t even stand water. I have also lost quite a lot of weight in a worryingly short time. I have been getting headaches - sometimes very bad sometimes dull. 

I also cannot focus at all. I feel weak and my brain foggy. I can’t even really formulate my words well or how I use to. I will have to ask someone to repeat something over and over agin trying SO HARD to make my brain make it make sense. This has made school so difficult.

I am at an amazing but very competitive selective school and wanting to go to medical school. I have been struggling immensely with online school. On top of having a crazy amount of work there is the incredible pressure of the extra stuff you have to do for this career. I am just overloaded, very behind and just wondering how everyone else does it. 

I think i am going through a hard time mostly because of quarantine. I used to walk everywhere and travel to and from school everywhere. I loved school so much. I loved my friends. Now I just get out of bed, log onto my computer and sit in that room all day. I absolutely hate it. I feel stagnant, hopeless and useless. I don’t get the interaction or relief of my friends. There isn’t really a break. I miss my friends and just people my age so badly it hurts. I feel so lonely. I have actually gone out to see some people a few times but I wasn’t really myself and came back and fell into an extreme depression for and panick (for a couple of sm days) just ruminating on how I behaved and how I bet people don’t actually want to hang out with me and just embarrassed and angry at myself. Just playing it over in my head and being horrified and ashamed of myself. 


Just if anyone’s wondering btw I would never consider suicide or anything - I could never ever do that to my family. But there is just no escape."
1800,Am I seeing things or am I just overthinking it?,"I am a female 19. So I’ll try to keep this short. Every now and then I see things out of the corners of my eyes. Sometimes it’s colored and other times it’s just a shadow. It’s never close to me either, always farther away, never close. It’s almost always humanoid figures and it makes me do a double take. It’s happens quite often, but I shake it off as my brain playing tricks. 


This time it was different. I opened the fridge and when I went to close it, I thought there was a hooded figure right next to me. I jumped and was definitely startled. I also thought I heard something’s as well, but again there was nothing there after the double take. While not often, this same scenario has happened on different occasions throughout my life. 


Do I have something bigger going on with my brain? I mean how can even tell if you’re sick? If you’re sick, you’ll just assume everything’s fine, but Im already paranoid something is not fine. I am kinda concerned because Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders run in the family. 


Other than hearing and seeing things that are not there, which could be blamed on the fact that I am overthinking, I don’t really have any other worries. I do have anxiety which is stemmed off my PTSD though. 
The reason why I haven’t brought it up with my Therapist is because I don’t want to seem like I’m searching for problems."
1801,My life is a nightmare I have agoraphobia,"This condition I have is so toxic in my life i fear from everyone and everything getting a job is impossible and my step father dont understand what it is but my mother yes she gets it and is totally supportive.  Me and my stepfather's relationship has been deteriorating since I have graduated high school in 2018 but since graduation my mental health has been declining I'm always declining help lying how I feel and even taking medication to help but it's all not working I lie and say it is but its not...  I'm tired scared and frightened by everyone's eyes on me and having their presence puts me in a panic. This is why I cant keep a job down (I'm 20 and male) . Me and my step father have been fighting since a month after graduation it's been like this since I'm mentally numb, lost and not sure where to turn, suicide came into mind many, many times a day but I just forget about it and suffer with what I have. I feel like i have lost touch with my self.. who ever reads this thank you.. for spending the time I dont have friends it means alot for people to read this and tell me what I should do with my life!!"
1802,Im realising that I'm TERRIFIED of death and getting older (19F),"I turned 19 in May and for the most part it was great, however the longer I think about my age and how much time has passed, I am legitimatly scared of death and growing older. 

I can't help but be reminded that next year I'll be 20, and in only 10 short years I'll be 30. 10 years closer to a day that I will never EVER be able to avoid. I really don't want to die. I don't believe in heaven or hell, I believe that one our bodies have grown too tired and worn that its lights out, gone. Pure darkness, no more existence and no more remembering anything or anyone from my life. It scares me more when I think about this in regards to others. The idea of someone I love simply losing their entire memory or awareness of their own and others existence is really damn scary and tbh I don't know what to do.

Sometimes this fear gets to the point that I consider ending things now just so I don't have to wait for the day but my mind does eventually calm down and nothing happens, however the idea is still there."
1803,I HATE YOU,"I don't know what's happening to me! I can feel this unrelenting, desperate monster clawing to get out of my skull. 

WHY THE FUCK DID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS TO ME?!

I hate you so much for making my life full fear. All because of a mistake that you made. You ruined my life! And I can't even tell you that, because if I do I'll put you in as much pain as I'm in. Maybe you deserve that, but I truly think no one deserves this. 

I FINALLY FEEL WHAT IVE ALWAYS WANTED! AND BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID TO ME I CAN NEVER HAVE IT! 

The only thing truly worth while in this world, and I can't be FUCKING NORMAL enough to hold onto it! 

I HATE YOU 
I HATE YOU 
I HATE YOU 
I HATE YOU"
1804,Just got permanently banned from r/Veterans because I posted an article about the Rising Suicide Rates of Veterans and Mental Health Awareness.,"My Post got into the front page with over 400+ Upvotes and It's starting to gain a lot more traction. and more Veterans started sharing their experiences such as Homelessness, Depression, Suicide Attempts, PTSD, Trauma, and a lot more. (The Article I Shared: [More U.S. Veterans Have Committed Suicide In The Last Decade Than Died In The Vietnam War](https://allthatsinteresting.com/veteran-suicide) )

I got a message from the staff that I'm permanently banned from the community which is pretty shitty.

It's a bit frustrating that they are hiding the fact that Veterans are struggling with Mental Health Issues such as PTSD, Suicidal Thoughts, and Depression.

Because opening topics and discussions like this would help Veterans who are struggling with Mental Health Problems be aware that their feelings aren't a sign of weakness and getting help is definitely ok and giving them more knowledge about Mental Health.

I'm just a bit mad and sad that they are trying to stay away from this topic as much as possible."
1805,Could I have a mental illness?,"I feel like I don’t know who am I. I have a hard time defining my identity as an individual. I’ve gone through so many “phases” and I still haven’t found anything that fits. My morals and beliefs change so constantly that they might as well not exist. My sense of style goes from casual to preppy to punk to whatever I feel like wearing. I’m not truly passionate about anything. I couldn’t even begin to tell you what I enjoy doing. I’ve tried playing guitar, working out, sewing, hunting, art, and a thousand other things but nothing ever stuck.

My personality changes so often that I don’t even know how to describe myself. Sometimes I’m the smart student that everyone looks up to and other times I’m a lazy slob who spends all day smoking. Sometimes I’m quiet and reserved and other times I’m the center of attention. Sometimes I’m short tempered and violent and other times I’m compassionate. I feel “fake”

I’ve dedicated a lot of my time to school and make good grades, but now that I’m finally graduating, I’m realizing how much of my life I’ve wasted. I was never passionate about my schoolwork. It was just a means to an ends. I plan on attending college this fall but I have no idea what I want to study. I don’t know what kind of career I want. Again, there’s nothing that *really* interests me.

It’s all very frustrating. People always say “just be yourself” but I change so much that I have no sense of self. At first, I could ignore it, but these thoughts have been tearing me apart ever since quarantine. I’m never happy (I don’t even know what would make me happy) and I constantly feel unaccomplished.

A few years ago I saw a therapist that diagnosed me with depression and anxiety disorder, but I feel like this is something else."
1806,"""Goodnight my Typh, I love you"". This is the last message I received from him, he last logged on 4 years ago.","We met when we were 11 years old. You became faster than I thought my best friend of all time. I felt like the happiest and luckiest girl in the world. We had never met but we were already talking about our first meeting in such a cute way. I thought of you every morning and evening on the way to school. And frankly I will continue for a long time. You were the only person who understood me at this time in my life. I realized that you were for a long time my only reason to get up in the morning because I knew I was going to log on my computer and talk to you.

Even today I look for your face on the subway platforms, at the corner of a street or even in schools. The scents of lavender that you loved so much that I find on my street mingle with too old memories of you. I have to stop there before talking about how the darkness would be a perfect backdrop to mix our silly laugh of terrible children. We both know how much our sighs and discussions could break through the calm night.

We were 14 years old. You abandoned me for no reason, I can't really open my heart anymore, I think about it again and again. I can't totally fix the hole you left me. 
Now I'm just so depressed and insecure. Fuck..."

1808,My friend left because I told him I told him I had DID,I was diagnosed with DID (dissociative identity disorder) a few years ago but haven't really told anyone about until today when I told my friend and he didn't take it well. He said I was crazy and to never contact him again. There is a lot of stigma surrounding the disorder so I knew it would happen eventually but I didn't expect it to be the first person I told. It really upsets me since he was one of my closest friends. I'm kinda glad though because I don't want people who just leave like that in my life.
