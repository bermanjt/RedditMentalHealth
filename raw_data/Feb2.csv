0,Advice for helping my bf with bipolar 2 in a depressive episode,"Hey all - I was dating my bf for about a year and during that first year we had a lot of push and pull and he broke up with me twice.  During the second breakup I had a realization that his happiness and then his withdrawal were on a cycle and I had remember him mentioning he had been diagnosed as bipolar 2 in his mid twenties (he is 40 now). When we came back together we had a lot of really productive talks about mental health and positive ways to help his depressive episodes, which included working out, eating better and tryin other natural treatments.  He said he had tried medication in his 20s and hated it, claiming that it made him feel like a zombie, so that was out of the question.

So about a year and a half ago we discovered Kratom.  Kratom is a controversial supplement that attaches to opioid receptors and is very successful in helping people with chronic pain, depressing and anxiety.  I myself have generalized anxiety and although I take medication, Kratom has helped at times where I was having a bad time.  Now some people get really deep into the Kratom world, getting up to 50g a day, and luckily he never reached that number but he was taking about 12g over the course of a day.  He cut way back to about 3g per day and then he started doing more research and he realized that Kratom can screw with your hormones if you have thyroid issues (which he does - he has Graves’ disease) so he gave up Kratom all together.

Obviously I don’t want him taking something that has a harmful side effect, but I think the Kratom was basically managing his bipolar for him.  He quit cold turkey about 6 weeks ago and it’s been a rough 6 weeks.  We had a few rough spots of him being generally irritable and snappy that ended with me crying.  Thankfully those events precipitated conversations about his general state of mind since being off the Kratom.  I pointed out to him that he has atleast 2 days a week where he shuts down after work.  He says a lot he doesn’t feel good, like his head is dizzy or he just feels off.  He describes his thoughts most days as “mental diarrhea”.  

So today being Valentine’s Day, we still did really sweet things with each other but when he came home from work I asked him if there was anything specific bothering him and he said no, he just thinks his depression is coming back.  He confessed that he goes into work in the morning and then comes home and sleeps for 2 hours and then goes back to work.  Most days he comes home from work and sleeps.  We used to go work out together but my work schedule changed so once I couldn’t go he stopped going.  So we talked today about internal vs external stressors.  He said there is nothing in his life he would change, he has a good job, a great gf (which makes my heart smile), we are talking about getting engaged and planning a future.  But he said he just wants to sleep and doesn’t feel engaged in life (which is very common in depression).  I told him that indicates the problem is internal then and he may have a chemical imbalance that needs help to fix.  The problem is he comes from a Spanish family where mental health is extremely taboo and the idea of therapy and medication is a no go.

I told him that having bad days is totally normal and I don’t expect him to be mr. cheery all the time but when it’s been continuing for weeks, I do need to see him making an effort to get some help.  He said he knows his moods wear on me and that just adds to the problem.  My suggestion since he is so therapy averse was to make a deal that for one month he would really commit to getting to the gym 3x per week and regularly meditating and eating healthy.  If he couldn’t stick to the month or couldn’t make it to the end of the month, then he would try talking to a counselor.  

I don’t know if what I am doing is right but I don’t know how else to help him.  I love him very much but he is right that his moodiness can be very wearing on me.  And just as an FYI he did see his endocrinologist and his t levels are within range.  I’m also starting to mess with my own head that something else is going on that he’s not telling me (which he said no to when I asked him).

So any way here are on Valentine’s Day and my Valentine is sad and I want to help him.  Any advice is greatly appreciated ❤️"

4,Needing some reassurance,My mom came to visit me for the last time before she moves across the country. She surprised me and I wanted to spend more time with her especially because I’ve been feeling down. I called out of work for it and I feel so anxious and guilty about it.
5,Very sweaty arm pits.,"I have very sweaty armpits. Even when I'm just sitting on the couch chilling. I can sweat enough to soak a shirt so it is noticeable 5 or 10 minutes after I put it on. I have tried antiperspirant, charcoal soaps and shaving. But nothing seems to cut it down. What can I do?"
6,Help me please,I've been fixated on psychosis and schizophrenia anything like that like constantly worried I might get it basically schiz ocd and now I'm worried about hallucinating and I do have vision problems which is visual snow where my vision is static sometimes colours on the walls from  lights and then after images and eye floaters. One morning I was looking out the window and I thought I saw a seagull and then I panicked and was thinking oh no I'm hallucinating was it there or wasn't it is this the beginning of schizophrenia and then I was wondering could it have been because of how much stress I've been under because of my anxiety or because I get little skeep a night or was it the way my nets were positioned that made it look like there was one. Then an hour ago tonight I was talking to my dad and focused on him agony I thought I saw something fly by agondnd my first thought was okay now I'm. Schizophrenic and that wasn't even real so it was either my vision problems idk and this happened in school when I thought I saw a spider dangling from the ceiling and then had an anicety attack afterwards saying I'm schizophrenic. This has only happened after my constant stress over schizophrenia. I constantly have to re check everything 'so i know I'm not hallucinating and now because I'm so aware i see things in the corner of my eye I pay attention to everthing. I'm 15 and female

8,My experience during a 5250 hold in a mental hospital.,"https://medium.com/@mentalhealthisbroken/stay-away-from-the-college-hospital-in-la-county-d26ca2077e2e

Was a pretty terrible experience all around.  Was under a 5150 escorted by police, then put on a 5250.  And I might be headed back there, because I'm still suicidal and just lied my way out of the hospital out of fear of being there forever."
9,Voluntary walk out states,I need a list of of states that allow people to voluntarily walk out of the hospital if someone tries to commit them. I have literally nothing wrong with me and I'm tired of ending up in there. Does anyone have a list of states in the United States that allow you to leave if you're involuntary?
10,I wholeheartedly believe that I was born in the wrong generation,I believe that I was supposed to live in Ancient Greece
11,Is there a way to cope with derealization/depersonalization/dissociation?,"I started to experience feeling like the outer world wasn’t “real” or just seemed strange and off when I was 14, after 2 times I smoked WAY too much marijuana and felt awful (it may also have been laced with coke). I was also being abused at this time and had been for several years.

When I was 15 I was diagnosed with CPTSD from years of childhood abuse. I stopped going to therapy because I couldn’t find a therapist I liked. When I was 17, I started experiencing these feelings again, feeling like the outer world wasn’t quite real or was off, but I also experienced it with people. My mom felt foreign to me at times, like I knew I knew her, but she just seemed foreign. Music I loved and had been listening to for a long time had the same feeling. People, places. I felt I was looking down at a foreign body or seeing a stranger in the mirror at times, not enough to send me into a panic attack but enough to be uncomfortable. I stopped experiencing this as much when I turned 18, though I went though another traumatic experience.

I am almost 19 now and 2 months ago I had an acute overdose (amphetamines this time. I know. Please do not call me an idiot, i already know I am and have heard it from every single person I’ve gone to to try to get help, except my boyfriend, doctors included, I’m not ever touching drugs again). When I had this overdose I was very sick for 5 days. I was fine for a few days after, and then I started having health issues that haven’t gone away since. But additionally, during those 5 days I was sick, I was experiencing some mild psychosis and dissociation. And since the OD, I’ve been experiencing derealization, depersonalization, dissociation more than before. It’s giving me a lot of anxiety because it’s so uncomfortable. (As a note I do think I have an anxiety disorder but wasn’t diagnosed with one, I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 9 though which has got MUCH better since then as I learned how to manage it)

I will probably see a psychologist at some point but until then, what can I do to calm myself during these episodes of derealization and depersonalization? Is there anything that will help? Anything I can do that will help over time?"
12,I don't want to hangout or get a bf because I have mental problems...,"Like,  why hangout with me when u can hangout with a mentally healthy person???"

I should read more about this ""psychomotor retardation"" the author talks about. I've had some really unproductive days. Most are completely self-sabotaging, as if I'm trapped in my body and behind the fog I'm anxious and crying out to keep a routine. It takes about a week to get my sleep back on track but then even if it is on track, I often can't make myself do what I need to. I couldn't make myself anything to eat today because I didn't really want to go through any sort of cooking process. I just paced around, looked in cabinets and the fridge, and forgot. So, this article might help explain why even the most basic functions are hindered by depression."
16,My sister has been stalking my cousin for 8 years,My sister is a stalker...She sends my cousin 10-15 unwanted emails and pictures everyday. Is there a way to seek help for stalkers? She’s diagnosed with depression and psychosis.
17,Teva sertraline?,"Idk if this is ok to post here, if not I'm sorry I'm still getting used to reddit. I just got a prescription yesterday for teva sertraline, 25mg for 2 weeks then an increase to 50. I've only been between two anxiety medications(clonazepam and ativan) since I was 13 and I kept trying to tell the psychiatrist it was making me aggressive but they didn't care. When I got my first appointment with a adult psychiatrist she actually listened to me and said alot of the pills they gave me couldve ended up damaging me more than helping me(I was on a handful of diffrent antidepressants and antipsychotics. My pharmacy always had problems with my psychiatrist actually filling out my prescriptions and sometimes I'd go a month or two without a pill that I was supposed to take every day....) and if the anxiety medications I had tried in the past didn't work I could try this. I just wanted to know if anyone had good results with this(I know everyone's diffrent but I'm just curious it would help to hear some people's experiences. I just used to hate the way my other medication made me feel.)

Tldr(first time doing a tldr so I hope it's ok lol)
I have anxiety about taking my anxiety medication, has anyone had good experiences with it?(I know everyone's diffrent)"
18,Depression after a massive break up and due to a upcoming court date.,"This may be a bit of a long post but I have to get it off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

About two years ago on Halloween my fiancee ending up leaving me after many years of being together and having a child. I found out she cheated on me a month before Halloween with someone she met at a club. I was getting making a snack late one night and her phone lit up with a DM on instagram talking about how nice her body was and other messages of that nature. She had told me that the weekend she went out my daughter was staying with her at her mothers because it was easier to visit her uncle that way due to a shorter drive. Turns out her mother watched my daughter while her and her sister went out to a club. Fast forward to Halloween and we had planned to go out as a family, just me my fiancee and my daughter. That day she decided she wanted to go out with friends and family somewhere else and through our plans out the window which caused a huge argument. I ended up not going with them because of the argument. She came back later that night and said she was leaving me, it was round three AM when she got home. She then told me that the next morning two people were moving into our apartment and I was being told to leave. I told her no as my name was also on the apartment so she had no right to throw me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been taking care of my daughter for most of that year due to her working nights and during the day. She didn't want our daughter to go to daycare at that time so I decided to watch her. In the end she ended up moving out to her mothers house as I was not going to be thrown out by someone who treated me that way. Fast forward a month or so after the break up I found out she was going to be moving in with her brother who is a drug dealer and here Illegally. I told her that I did not want my daughter to be in that environment so she could move back into the apartment and if she would give me a month to look for somewhere to live I would move out and she could keep the place. She agreed and everything was fine for about a week. She would sleep on the couch and we generally kept our distance from each other. After a week there was a night when I went out to make dinner and she told me I had an appointment to sign off the lease next week. She set it up for me and was basically once again trying to kick me out. We once again got into a huge argument and I told her it was not going to happen. She called the police on me because we were yelling (not even joking). They arrived and basically told her that I had a right to be upset because she came back after so long and was trying to force me out. She ended up moving out to her mothers again and found an apartment with her new boyfriend. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this time was I watching her for about five to six days a week until about late July-August. During this time I was unemployed and basically living off help from my girlfriend (now fiancee). It was enough to get food and pay for rent and take care of my daughters needs. At the beginning of August she told me she had lost her job and that she would start seeing her daughter more. I thought this was great as I would actually be able to look for work and she would be able to see her mother more. It ended up being a nightmare. A few weeks later she told me she had enrolled her in daycare. She didn't come to me to talk about where or when or any details what so ever regarding this. It made me really upset as I felt that as her father I should have a say in it. She told me I would also have to help pay for it. I asked her why I couldn't just watch her instead and she just told me it wasn't happening. I could not give her any money so she went to my father who loaned her money. It turned out she was getting assistance with it and used my fathers money to pay the other half. The real kicker was that my daughter didn't even end up going those two weeks that were paid for. This is when my depression really started. 

After this daycare even happened she ended up enrolling my daughter in school and moving with her boyfriend an hour away. Once again she did not tell me she was going to do this or even ask for my opinions on schools or anything. She has not kept me informed on anything going on at school and I now only get to see my daughter on the weekends. 

During this time of not seeing my daughter I have become incredibly depressed. I went through a period of drinking a lot, which I have stopped and just started taking sleeping pills because I did not want to even be awake anymore. It was all too much. My fiancee had basically been there to support me through all of it and I put her through a lot. 

My grandmother also passed away during this time and left me with a significant amount of inheritance. I have not received it yet as my family and I agreed we would all get the split of it when her house was sold which has taken quite a while to get on the market. 

I have still not been able to find employment but still have my apartment and my daughter is taken care of when she is here. 

My depression has only gotten worse due to not seeing her and not being able to find work. Now my ex is taking me to court for child support and there is no way I can afford it. I have basically begged her to not do this as it could end up ruining my life. She has no sympathy what so ever. Not once did she ever offer me any help when I had been watching her all those months. Nothing. Now she wants money from me. It has made me suicidal and worried that I will be ordered to pay for something I cannot afford. 

Maybe I am a bad father because of all of this like she has said. I have done my best for my daughter. It's just all too much for me. I have no motivation, don't even feel like waking up basically every day. It has all taken a huge toll on me and it upsets me so much that she would continue to beat me down this whole time with no sympathy what so ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. I just had to get it off my chest. My court date is Thursday and I am very worried."
19,I need some help to support a friend,I have a friend who has tried taking their life by ODing and I wanted to know if there are any key medications that they shouldn't have access to so that its less likely for them to OD or to OD on something severe
20,On this day of love it's important to remember you aren't alone,"Even for those of us who are alone tonight (this guuy) it's empowering to know there is a community of compassionate people here to provide solidarity and words of encouragement, especially in those times where it feels impossible to talk to people about your illness. We are stronger together ♥️"
21,What is this,"So I don’t really know where to post this but I guess this subreddit may be okay.
 A few days ago this kinda weird thing happened to me and idk what it was. I was sitting in my room looking at memes when I gradually started getting more and more tense. Every tiny little sound that I could hear made me jump, and my eyes kept darting everywhere looking at random things. Every time I turned my head I kind of expected somebody to be there watching me. I imagined a really tall skinny black silhouette. I saw these scary faces flash over things (it wasn’t one of those times where something looks like a face and you see a face, it was something that didn’t look like a face at all and I just see a face. When I look back at it it was normal). The face thing had happened before but I guess it scared me more when everything else was happening. It was like I was super aware of everything that was happening around me.
I’m not super concerned about this but I just want to know what happened and if I should be worried or not. 
Also if you know a better subreddit for this kind of thing pls tell me."
22,Going to Mayo clinic in two months,"I've been suffering from mental illness for more than 15 years now and my life has gotten more and more difficult and I've really stopped functioning. Work is terribly difficult, I can't seem to make friends, I have a lot of trouble going out of the house etc. But what's most infuriating is that I've been addressed a bunch of times and gotten everything from anxiety/ major depression to antisocial personality disorder. Ive been to a few hospitals and a couple of residential programs but finally I wrote a long letter to my psychiatrist and explained how I've felt for so long and he agreed I needed a real definitive answer.

They only do ""consultations"" for 2 hours at Mayo but if there psychiatry or psych staff feel it necessary to do more testing they will. They ask you stay for 3 days from your consultation. I'm really excited to go get a consultation by one of the most prestigious hospitals and scared that they'll not find my case warrants further inquiry or that they'll just say I'm depressed and have no new answers. But at least I'm trying and I'm going through with it. Wish me luck"
23,A question,"Does anyone know what it's like to be hospitalized? With my horrible and dangerous mindset I feel it's in my future, and i'd just like to be prepared. Cheers."
24,Psychosis,I've been taking my medication for around 7 months and it has help tremendously with the hallucinations but everytime I tried to meditate or just be out in nature I start hearing voices again. My question is will I be able to be in my mind by myself ever again or will I have to live with this forever ?  It just bothers me because I wanna be in peace by myself but the voices come and ruin my day.
25,Extreme self consciousness affecting motor control as early teen,"When i was an early teen I was so self conscious that i was aware of every movement i made, consciously making it. Really stiff walk etc. On the verge of going out of my mind with anxiety. I discovered alcohol and at least self medication worked. Because i controlled every movement my anxiety was very noticeable and peoples disturbed reactions to me were evident and fueled the feeling and behaviour even more. I don't have this problem anymore and i was wondering if anyone has had or has it and or knows what the hell it is."
26,"I'm so afraid to go mad ,because I feel so bad and not real.I don't know what do I feel ,want or like.I'm paranoid,I don't understand what I am and how this world works.People are so fake and always lie.I hate and like them at the same time..I like to be alone ,but then I could feel worse than I was","...I don't know.I feel useless,scared,disgusted,under pressure,derealisation,restless,TIRED,sad,lonely,down and etc.I don't even know how people call other feelings which I feel"
27,Wondering if I'm a narcissist,"My GF (25) and I (26) recently broke up back in October. We were together for 6 years, actually broke up on our anniversary so that was fun. We have a 4 year old son together and we still live together. We teeter on the edge of getting back together. In December she told me she was talking to someone else and I kind of had felt that coming. On my end, there was also someone that I was interested in and would likely be pursuing. When I told her this, she broke down bc she realized she wasn't ready to move on. She immediately broke things off with this other guy. Here we are in the middle of February and still in a weird holding pattern. We still do things together with our son, we joke around alot, and we still talk to each other about our days and what not. We also still argue. This is where the point of this post comes in, she believes I show signs of narcissistic personality disorder. 

To give more background and info on where we are both coming from. We decided to have a child, it was not an accident. I had hesitations, we were both still in school and I was the only one working as a bartender. She assured me she'd be able to find a job. We lived with her father during the pregnancy and for the first few months after our son was born. She was unable to find work as she was pregnant and still needed a job flexible enough to accommodate her school schedule. She did not want to work in a restaurant bc of a bad previous experience. In the last 4 years she has had a few jobs, but they were mostly part time and she didn't help with the bills at our apatmtment, the money she makes generally just goes to my son. 

After he was born, she had postpartum depression (I realize this now but st the time didn't do a good job helping her through that). She was a super light sleeper and I was not. She was woken up by the baby a majority of the time to feed him (she was breastfeeding). I fully admit, I didn't do enough of the mid night wakings. This is where I trace our separating too. I felt I'd lost her affection, it was difficult to connect with her. Obviously she had a strong connection with our son. Looking back, I realize this was mostly due to the postpartum, but at the time it just made me feel like I was in a loveless relationship and unable to connect with the person I love. 

With this lack of connection, I began to join online gaming communities and playing online video games to connect with people. To move in with her dad and closer to her grandparents, who help immensely with our son, I moved away from my family and friends. I am left with my friends from work. Games were one of my only escapes. She obviously felt like it was me not helping with our son enough and being lazy. I understand both our viewpoints here. 

Over time this divide grows. She will tell me what I do that bothers her, and I do make an effort to fix some of these issues. From my perspective it's just never enough, from her perspective she's not going to give me credit for things I should do already. She gets upset with me because I have an issue with my memory. I do forget small things, whether it's a conversation or forgetting to pick up something from the store after work. She hates this. Idk how to help this tbh, I'm a generally smart person but little things do escape me. One thing that frustrates me, is that she will recall a conversation we've had and remember it going a different way than I do. Sometimes she'll be right and she uses this as a justification that every time when we remember conversations differently, she must be right bc ""remember these times when she was."" I know for a fact that she is not always right in these instances.

I do apologize when I know I'm wrong. She gets super frustrated at me when shell get mad at me for something and my response is that she does the same thing. She says I'm constantly blame shifting. While yes, I will point out these instances, I'm not just doing it to not take blame for something. It's genuinely frustrating to have someone get angry at you and hold things against you when they do those same things. Her sister and our sons godmother have been shown text messages and they tell her that I do play the victim card alot. This is one major basis for her believing I have narcissistic tendencies. Playing the victim is a characteristic of it. 

We just recently got into a pretty big argument where all this came out. She is angry at the idea of me finally changing and working on myself and another women getting that version of myself. While she got the version that couldn't change for her. She doesn't think it's fair. 

If it adds anything were both havjng jealousy issues with us being around other males and females. I have tried to provide both perspectives as best as I can but also realize it's hard to judge from my side of the story. I'm not angry that she feels I may be a narcissist, I'm just worried she might be right. I hate that our relationship ended, I'd love to get back together however I worry nothing will ever let us get past this, no matter what I change. I worry she will always see something wrong in me."
28,Looking for Work-Health Therapy programs,"An acquaintance of mine posted recently about a ""work-health program"" they just went through where they went to group therapy three times a week and a class on depression, anxiety, and stress management two times a week. This is EXACTLY the type of program I'm looking for but cannot find. I reached out to the acquaintance about a website or a phone number so I can look into the program for me, but they said went through their insurance and doesn't know how to get me in contact with anyone. If anyone can point me in the right direction, I could really use the help. 

Location: Los Angeles, CA (US)"
29,Do I have mental health issues?,"I am male 26 and single. I find dating and relationships and even friendship hard to maintain. I spend a lot of time alone, I also work alone. I don’t have many friends to go out with nor do I care to leave the house much. 

I’m depressed, irritable and I have a hard time displaying emotions like being visually happy or excited. I usually wake up go to work, come home alone and play video games and go to bed. I am also very socially awkward and don’t know what to say sometimes."
30,I can’t feel love?,I’m schizoaffective and I feel nothing but numbness even for my own mother. Please help me. I’ve never truly loved or been loved.
31,Advice for dissociation,"So basically my issue is that if I don’t smoke weed, I dissociate and forget what sanity feels like. The only time I can rationalize properly and feel any emotion besides apathy, excitement, or anxiety is if I’m smoking weed. But I can’t smoke weed because I’m on probation. I’ve done years of different types of therapy, been on countless meds, and I’ve tried grounding and all that shit, but the longer I go without weed the more detached from reality I am. I’ve been like this for as long as I can remember. What do you suggest, and does anyone have similar experiences? And yes I have severe PTSD."
32,Trying to leave.,"I am seeking information on electroshock therapy and how to induce long term amnesia. I would like to erase who I am. Any and all information would be appreciated. I don't want help. I want to be gone, mentally. Physically being gone throws stigma and problems on my kids. I just want to be gone, let something else take over. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am willing to take any steps. I will take them with or without help. I simply want to know how to do it properly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."
33,How I'm feeling (a rant about my current thought process),"Right now I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone, right now I feel sorry for myself if I make even the slightest mistake while doing something. Right now I feel like I push people away who might actually end up liking or loving me back, right now I have the strong urge to go back to people I used to talk to because it seems easier than starting something new, right now I have to urge to just scream and yell into the air that I hate everything Including myself, right now I feel like if I don't get a relationship that I do deeply want, nothing else in life will ever line up or make sense. Right now I crave the touch of a person, to hold someone's hand, to lay in bed with someone and hear their heart beating rhythmically with mine. right now I feel like I just wanna be fucking appreciated, right now I feel like I just want someone who'll recognize what i have to offer and fucking see how amazing I am. right now I feel like confessing to my crush how I feel, but right now I fear I'll be the laughing stock at work if they told other people. Right now I'm just tired, tired of waiting for happiness, tired of waiting for the love and affection of another human being, right now I just want things to be easier."
34,Stuck in a loop... where do I start?,"I’ve been at this before so many times and it always results in the same loop:

New beginning -&gt; take action -&gt; think about all the things I have to do -&gt; realize how many there are -&gt; not knowing how to prioritize -&gt; waste time trying to decide where to start -&gt; get anxious about wasting time and having to decide on the action with the upmost priority now since time is becoming even more limited -&gt; anxiety builds up -&gt; it becomes more energy efficient to shut down and do nothing rather than taking action (behavioral shut down model) -&gt; trying to numb the anxiety -&gt; weed -&gt; addiction -&gt; depression

Right now, I’m at the “anxiety builds up” step. Earlier I wished I was smoking a joint (first time actually craving weed since I quit on 01/01) just so I could relax. I had a 20min meditation session. It helped. But now I just want to take a shower and go to bed and start over tomorrow. But I know I’ll just be repeating the same process and anxiety will build up even more. I’m stuck. Literally stuck in a logic loop. I feel like a broken machine and that I have no control over myself and my thoughts. 

What do I do?"
35,I have no one,"I really feel like I have no one. I feel so alone. I speak to people at school but that's about it. I had a friend who I talked to but it always feels like i cant talk to them about my feelings/vent because their problems are more significantly than mine and when I do, I get responses that really equate to no support. I give in all my support to get nothing in return. My parents don't understand what I'm going through mentally at this moment. I really have no one. I always suppress my emotions but at this point, it's so difficult so I'm having breakdowns every hour. I hate this. I have no support system and I'm so lonely. I feel like absolute trash."
36,"I collapse from overstimulation. Doctors have found nothing wrong with me, but clearly something is wrong. Anyone have insight into this? Preferably someone in the medical field.","I got a myriad of mental issues, but most of them I can put my finger on what they are. 

No one's ever given me a diagnosis of what the hell this problem is though. When I am in a crowd of people, my brain constantly tries to pick up on and follow every conversation, something I understand is common in people with autism. What is far less common is that if the number of people and number of conversations becomes too high, I lose consciousness and collapse. By other people's accounts I am usually out 10-30 seconds before I recover, feeling very hazy and barely able to get my feet back under me.   


It started in 7th grade, it got way, way worse around the time I turned 30. I can't go to a crowded grocery store anymore, just walking into that kind of place makes me feel like I'm about to pass out so I just leave if there's too many people in a store now.   


I can't hold a job, I can't hold a fucking conversation. So far doctors have given me nothing to go on and the closest I can find to what I have is a muscle disorder, not a neurological one."
37,What's Wrong With Me? (Diagnosis Denial),"I just don't know.

I've got it in my head that it's not bipolar, what's wrong with me. That it's explained by something else, ADHD (which testing did say I have), and more recently borderline.

I don't really fit borderline traits, Maybe this is a result of going to individual therapy since I was 16, but I don't lash out at people or myself. I occasionally used to get sensitive to criticism, but that's greatly receded in the last few years. I have stable, lovely friendships and relationships with family, stable sense of self, no fears of abandonment. I only dissociate in depression, and I haven't dissociated in years. I don't 'split' on people. I express my emotions regularly with friends, family, and my therapist, and don't withhold anything; they're not excessively expressed.

Most of all, since getting on mood stabilizers, all my issues vanished: my binge/over eating, some feelings of 'my friends abandon/forgot me', dissociation, feeling empty, all of it --&gt; these symptoms which I'd only feel when depressed too. Literally, meds make em POOF, gone. And I haven't dealt with them in years.

Meanwhile, I do have periods of depression, followed by periods of higher/irritable mood and some manic symptoms (over-productivity, increased goal making, impulses, and becoming obsessive over something, in addition to increased sociability, hyperfocus, and the magnified sensory (over)stimulation.and the occasional paranoia).

However, I feel like a fraud, and think I search for these other explanations because I don't feel like I 'fit' the typical bipolar 'profile.' Asexual at all times, no real risk taking, no racing thoughts, no real creativity, no cleaning, etc....I feel out of place, like my manias aren't manias at all and I've somehow been misdiagnosed. Even tho, on mood stabilizers, I am finally stable.

I went through my doc today, where I quoted my beliefs I'm actually borderline. She said she hasn't gotten a sense for that in all her years of working with me, and explained how all my past behaviors can very much happen in the context of bipolar, especially bipolar depression. She also thinks I have an aversion to accepting the bipolar diagnosis because I'd need meds for my life (in my thoughts, she said).

Multiple psychiatrists and psychologists have agreed with the diagnosis, but I still can't accept it. I still think they're wrong somehow. But, it wouldn't be possible to feel fine JUST on the meds alone, if there were something else going on, right?

Sigh. Thanks for listening."

39,"Losing the will to live, but for some stupid reason keep holding on.","I thought I'd do this relatively anonymously so that I don't drag loved ones down any further with me or look like an attention-seeker to my friends. It's a big fucking pity party and pretty damn pathetic but oh well! I guess I just need to get it out. If you're in a shitty place yourself maybe don't read it!
I'm not suicidal, I don't pose a 'risk' to myself. I'm safe.
I'm diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder with psychotic features - have been for the last three years.
I pretend to everyone that I feel okay and even happy when in reality a part of me withers and dies every single fucking stupid day I'm alive. I've been doing this to the point that my healthcare professionals were questioning if I was purely mixed and manic and wondering if my lows are just crashes from the highs (I make up excuses that it's all situational and hide it as best as I can). 
I'm never stable. I'm either in a manic or hypomanic trance (which in reality is just a 'delusion' that you're happy; that your life is okay - well until it becomes nasty and psychotic) or varying degrees of miserable/down. I can laugh, smile, joke - even pretend to myself that I'm happy - but the truth is that I want to break down in tears.
I hate myself. I put on this act of being confident and happy - when I look in the mirror, I want to cry most of the time. I'd love nothing more than to end it all. The truth is, I don't have the fucking balls and I care about my family too much. I'm praying for a physical illness like cancer or a heart attack that will put me out of my misery quicker than this. 3-6 months of pain is better than a lifetime of misery and suffering. If I could die and make it look like a tragic accident and I had the balls to follow through I would. I've attempted suicide a few times and failed. The amount of time I spend thinking about what I'm going to put in my suicide note is scary. 
Everything I aspire to is fucked up by a major episode. Or me. I'm a fuck up and there's no point having aspirations. I'll sit on my arse for the rest of my miserable excuse of a life on disability benefits. It's fucking shameful but there's no point trying. I've tried so many times. I give up! I'll happily drink, smoke and even drug myself to death. It numbs the pain and speeds up the process.
The meds don't help. Psychology doesn't help (load of shit for what is a chemical imbalance). All the meds do is keep you safe, sedated, quell the psychosis, looking 'well' and semi-'functioning' and out of hospital. I haven't taken to bed for years or self-harmed for over a year. I would love nothing more than to allow myself to feel shit but the meds tell me to keep holding on. I've held it in for so long that it's hitting crisis point now. I can't do it anymore. Nothing will make me feel better. I'm beyond help.
I was on aripiprazole, quetiapine, lithium and lamotrigine 2-3 months ago. Came off quetiapine first and aripiprazole a month ago. Sure, it's making me feel worse in some ways. I'm having nasty withdrawals - dissociating badly at points, feeling detached from reality - like it's a bad nightmare and my life isn't real, angry/irritable/argumentative, racing thoughts, wired/struggling to sleep or eat, strange visual disturbances etc. I'm getting to the point that I'm briefly terrified that people are trying my door when I hear noises outside. If I were speculating I'd say that it's possible that I'm entering a mixed episode, but the weird thing is that I don't appear majorly agitated, am coherent, aren't speaking fast or sounding majorly distressed all the time etc. It feels like it's all in my head and maybe I've just accepted reality? Coming off lithium and lamotrigine too. All they do is make you act normal whilst dying inside.
Anyone who says ""it will get better"" is deluded, full of shit or doesn't understand. Spare me the fucking optimism. Life's a piece of shit. The only two things that are certain is that you're born and then you fucking die.
I put on this persona of a happy go lucky person who doesn't let his mental illness get in the way. It's not true. It's a fucking act. I'm a phony. Sorry for being so depressing but I really needed to get this out."
40,A bad day made me want to mix meds. This was a mistake.,"I'm constantly switching between exploding in anger, crying, and catatonia. I have these full body shivers, I'm kind of sweaty, my head is pounding, and I'm super tired and wide awake at the same time. 
  
  
I can't get any prescribed stuff. I just mixed a couple of mood-related OTC pills. I'm not going to die, but all of my senses are going crazy. 
  
  
The moments when I'm not shaking are the worst. I feel like a shaken soda can placed over an open flame. I might explode. My eyes already feel like they're ready to force their way out. This is the worst headache. I just know that I'm going to feel awful tomorrow."
41,"Animal Abuse, as the Abuser","So.... I hate to admit this, but I was abusing my ex-partner’s cat for a few months. I was doing some awful stuff to her cat, always hitting her, shaking her, throwing her, choking her (mind you, she’s a baby cat, barely a few months old), anything really. I’d soak her in water, I was doing countless awful things to this poor baby.. it pains me to share this. 

The cat kept getting hurt, and we’d have to take her to the vet a number of times. I never told my partner a thing, I was scared of her judgment, and as such I allowed this to persist for months. I didn’t want to, the last thing I wanted to do was lie about something so awful, but when she eventually asked me (and she didn’t think I could be responsible for something so disposable, as I’m mostly balanced when it comes to my emotions; I’m a pacifist, really), I told myself I’d have to lie to her. And I did.. so this continued a bit longer. 

Anyways, sorry, I eventually couldn’t take lying to her anymore. I didn’t want to harm such a precious animal as this poor, baby cat— so I finally told my partner. She was heartbroken, and promptly, yet reasonably, told me to leave. It pained me, almost felt like betrayal as I was hoping she’d understand and help me get help, but of course I understand. It’s a lesson really. 

Since then, I told my parents, who kinda forced me into a psychiatric hospital at the start of this year (January). Now I’m waiting on this sort of mental health program I was in last year, I have Borderline Personality Disorder (specifically the Antisocial sort. Cluster B, I think) and I can’t wait to get my old therapist. I’ll be moving into this group home next week, which sort of sucks, but I’ll take whatever help I can get. This is not something I can keep ignoring, I’m 19, I need to deal with this now before it gets worse. This baby girl (the cat) isn’t the first animal I’ve abused either. 

I knew better than to hurt  the cat, yet I did anyway. And that kills me, I really do want to get better, I want some sort of atonement for what I’ve done. I’m blessed that my former partner loves me so much that she is supportive still, she also has wants for me to get better. 

I hope to maybe start going to an animal shelter, and helping animal rights activists or something if I can. I want to help others who suffer from mental health problems, I’ve always wanted to be an English teacher (sadly I dropped out of college, I was hating myself then and using too many drugs), and most importantly I want to help myself. I can’t do anything without helping me, I guess. I hope that’s not too selfish. 

I‘m sure that my abuse stems from self-hate, this constant sense of inadequacy, and wanting the cat to love me. I don’t know how related this is, but my mother died when I was 9 or 10 or so, which means she’s been gone for practically half of my life. And though I love my dad, we still have our issues. I’m working on self-love, I take it day by day. I’ve been, I told my former partner over 2 months ago, and I’m proud to say I haven’t harmed anyone (even myself) since then. I just really wanted to share this. 

I hope that’s ok."
42,Help Save Lives,"PLEASE SIGN this petition to help ELIMINATE pro-self harm, pro-eating disorder, and pro-suicide websites from Google’s search results. Link below:

http://chng.it/QMwQwKqk

When struggling from a mental illness, many people turn to the internet for help. When I did this, it almost cost me my life. Instead of finding sources of support or advice, I found pages and pages of harmful websites. Pro-self harm, pro-eating disorder, and most disturbingly, pro-suicide websites are all easily accessible through the Google search engine. These websites list “tips and tricks” that could be very detrimental to a person’s health, and in some cases life threatening.

While there are helpful resources included in these search results, such as the suicide hotline and crisis text line, it is not enough. When going through a mental health crisis, many people do not have the strength to click on a website that promotes recovery when there is one doing the exact opposite beneath it.

Google values responsibility, helpfulness, and thoughtfulness, and these websites go completely against their values. I believe that if Google could eliminate all websites from their search results that contain pro-self harm, pro-eating disorder, and pro-suicide content, thousands of lives could be saved.

Please sign and share this petition- You could save lives."
43,How often do you think about suicide?,It crosses my mind about every 20-30 mins
44,Would an therapist have the power to demand to speak to your attorney or case manager ?,So I've been seeing this therapist for about a year and a half. I got framed for a crime recently and now I'm having to face trial for it. I was talking to her about and she wanted  to talk to my attorney or my case manager about this and get more info. I told her that it is not needed and she wouldn't leave it alone. She started claiming that im hiding stuff from her and that it wasn't too much of her to ask. She said that she never felt this way before but now she is losing my trust and says that she thinks that I did it and now I'm lying to her and everyone about it and saying that I didn't do it. She claims that I'm breaking laws by not letting her talk to my attorney and case manager. She said if she doesn't have permission by next week then she is firing me as a client. Does she have the power to demand to speak to my attorney and etc ?? Is she crossing the line by firing me over something like this ??
45,Severe anxiety over rejection,"I got rejected by a friend recently and I feel like I'm loosing it, I don't really care that much about it to be honest but intrusive thoughts are making it hard to forget anything that had to do with the time spent with her. They are driving up a wall and i felt like i had delt with it and gotten closure with this issue but the anxiety still resides."

50,There's just never a good time to be dizzy for 3 days straight...,I'm trying to get off of Pristiq and the withdrawal is just three days of brain zaps/dizziness. I was on the lowest available dose. I can't cut the pills in halves or quarters or anything cus that's not how they work. I just had to pick a weekend and go for it. But as stated... There's just never a good time to be dizzy for three days straight.
51,Can someone explain what this is,"Everytime I try to go out and see friends now I get super sad and dip out early, and when I say super sad I mean I never knew it was possible to feel this low, and in addition to having multiple suicide attempts under my belt I watched that Futurama episode with the dog. My internal dialogue has always been negative since I was 3 but it's been getting way worse the last three years and I think it's related because it kicks into overdrive whenever I'm at a social event just constant whispering in my ear things like you're ugly and fat nobody wants you to come, you're stupid don't speak, everyone's going to laugh at you behind your back if you show up, they're going to make fun of your limp, you should have drank more bleach, you're one call away from hydro that's about as good a death as you can hope for, even your cat won't miss you when you're gone. I don't know what to do, I don't even know what's wrong. This internal narrative is right but it's still exhausting, it's different from my normal one because it's a voice I can physically here instead of just a stream of thoughts"
52,I think I’m just going to end up as a failure.,"Please please someone just reach out to me. I’m 20 and I really don’t know where I’m going to end up in life. I am going to be doing a program that helps people who have had a first episode of psychosis, and they have career counsellors to help me, but I would love to have someone to talk to. When things get too hard, I just give up and can’t find it in myself to continue trying. All throughout high school I was a shit student because I would get too stressed by the work and just give up. I might possibly have schizophrenia as I have delusional thoughts from time to time. I had a psychotic episode last year. I’m taking risperidone, but if I can’t manage my stress my symptoms could get even worse and I could have full blown schizophrenia. I can already imagine ending up in a really bad mental hospital and have a completely miserable life. During my psychosis, I remember I thought that my creepy childhood orthodontist was after me, and I remember being so angry at it that I said aloud “I’m going to kill him. I’m going to torture him.” I know I was just venting at the time but I’m so scared of one day relapsing into psychosis and then taking that step forward and actually hurting someone. I’m scared of hurting the people I love....god I love my family so much. I would love to kill myself before this happens but I’m just too scared to. 

A couple days ago I reversed my car out of the driveway and scraped my dads car. There wasn’t enough room and for some reason the thought of asking him to move the car didn’t cross my mind. My parents were angry, not just for dads car, but because my car is really nice and they paid for it and I put a huge dent in it. It just reminds me that my family puts so much goddamn effort in so I can live under their roof and I just waste it. I had to quit my job because I had irresponsibly not studied the products for it and i knew I was going to get fired. I’m so fucking stupid. I know that the solution is to stop avoiding the things that stress me out, but it’s such a painful process and one that could maybe cause me schizophrenia from the stress as I know it can trigger it. Mental illness fucking sucks. Life sucks."
53,Do I need help or am I tricking myself and my family?,[removed]
54,"I do genuinely hate living sometimes, but I would never do anything about it.","It's nights like these that remind me that I'm almost completely alone, and that my maybe 40-minute death would have just as little meaning as my 20-ish year life up until now. I am nothing. My death would mean nothing. My family probably wouldn't miss me. 
  
  
I think fear and laziness are the main things keeping me from doing anything about this. I instead use medicines to numb my brain most of the time. I'll probably just keep doing that until it stops working."
55,Going to work in a few hours and I feel like killing myself,"Not because of my job, I just suffer from suicidal ideation.  Ironically it's partially because I'm mortified by the fact death is inevitable, it leads me to think I should just off myself if I'm really going to fade into oblivion one day, makes everything seem useless and pointless.

I've called my insurance and they think I need to have another stay at a mental hospital.  I haven't told friends or family that I'm still on the brink of just blowing my brains out.  And I find the prospect of going into inpatient care again pretty unpleasant given my previous experience, and also I'm an adult so I don't particularly enjoy being treated condescendingly like a little kid.  What should I do to avoid having to do this?  I can't get a therapist quick enough and my only other remedy is to just get super high off drugs."
56,My brain anthropomorphized my mental health issues into someone I used to love: suggestions appreciated,"Tldr for the back story: i was best friends with someone for years up until this past December when they basically became abusive, manipulative, and started gaslighting me, trashtalking me behind my back, and lying through their teeth to me, until I called them out about it and they wanted to fix things but couldn’t give me the space I needed so they decided it wasn’t worth their time to fix things even after we agreed to try. 

For the last two months I’ve basically been working on myself (working out more/eating better, doing stuff that’s healthy for me, figuring out relationships with people, etc.) and I’ve gotten over this person (mind you i still will get angry whenever i see them, for obvious reasons) but ever since this shitshow happened it feels like all my mental health issues have basically taken this persons form in my head. All my anxiety and depression immediately goes directly back to my thinking “you’ll never get any better with anyone than that person” or thinking about what they’re probably doing right now versus my doing homework or working out or an actual job or whatever. I know it’s not healthy but I also don’t know what to do to change how my brain represents those issues to myself."

It is your love and passion that drives you, don't let the negative emotions dictate your life, never.

59,I only feel relaxed enough to eat food in a bath tub,"Kinda rambling but Okay so- I have like HELLA anxiety. And I’m also prescribed Vyvanse which is terrible for your appetite. Which is NOT good. I’m not underweight per say. But I would be a lot better if I gained a few more pounds. 

I’m a female. I was born originally in Mexico City and currently live in a Midwest state notorious for cold weather. My friends hypothesis that my extremely high metabolism and anxiety is set in motion because of the cold. It’s like my body’s in constant fight or flight mode. And I never noticed how much the cold had affected my mental health until this past winter. I even think to an extent the winter sets off my depression. If it’s super cold, I genuinely won’t have the motivation to get up. I just chatter inside my own home even with layers on. So in general this cold ass fucking weather and climate goes against the natural physiology of my body to the point that biologically I’m always more inclined to “rest” than to do shit, and that includes eating.

But I found a weird loop hole. 

For some reason, I only feel relaxed enough to eat when I’m in a hot bath. Something in my brain just relaxes enough where I can actually focus on the process of eating. I feel my breathing is more relaxed. I enjoy the taste of my food. I feel good. I even noticed that I can get some writing and reading done when I’m in the tub. I’ve basically incorporated bathtub time in my everyday life to the point that I have a food bucket and stuff.

Any ideas why this is? It’s make it hard to socialize."
60,prejudice - why?," 

I saw a therapist the other day, and to be frank she was getting hostile. she was trying to make me out that I was some ""baaaad"" dude. yeah....baaad. I don't do much that is bad. such as what??

so one time, I challenged her. I asked her ""why do you dislike me?"" and she said, ""did I say disliked you?!""

""your tone says as much. every time I come here, you try and abuse me and say how 'wrong' I am. I act the same way as others do. isn't it your duty to prescribe the same things you say are wrong on me onto others?""

""don't tell me about my duty!""

""yet you tell me that because I 'look smart', I should 'detach myself from the world'. What does that even mean exactly?""

""It means that there is a spiritual purpose for you.""

""so you're so superior to me, but then you don't know how to communicate? Why are you the better person in this scenario? why must I take in what you say as truth?""

""because I know you have a purpose. be nice!""

""why must I be nice? you haven't been nice to me. You're using some techniques to try and mess with me - how is that 'nice'? Is telling that I cannot have tattoos 'just because' 'nice'?""

""yes, I did say that.""

""so there are others who see doctors and they have tattoos, but I don't. is there a reason why not? you know what? just find me and section me and then you can explain to the board why you pick and choose which therapy goers have tattoos and which don't, because you're a spiritual person...""

And then I left, and I reported her and then said her body said that she is being disciplined but I didn't hear anything more for a month or so. They then got back and said she is put on suspended leave several months, but whatever. I just suspect there is a grand plot to deny me things that the masses do as normal. if her other clients can have tattoos and be normal BY THE BOOK, then so can I. the way I see it, is that if it's OK [for her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkxZFoWCd6k), [or her](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/lady-gaga-attends-lady-gaga-celebrates-the-launch-of-haus-news-photo-1581623569.jpg?resize=480:*), [or him](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427784599.jpg), [or her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMZxI9Lbq_M), to have open mental issues and act the way they do and get by with tattoos and stuff, then so can I. is it a racial thing, since I'm not white? or that I deserve to be bullied and abused? I thought ""society"" said that nobody deserves abuse..lol. I'll accept my ""lesser place"" #neverinamonthofsundays

I know I post about stuff like this a lot and to be frank, I don; 't care if I upset people - it's my voice and people can work around it if they are ""better and 'more normal'"". People are always free to speak and be a man (like I am since I ignore shit I don't like...) I just admit I have issues of bad therapy, and I won't rest until I get my piece - if it's because I'm not white or pretty or because I'm subject to somebody's racism or lookism or something, then good. I'll continue to ""annoy"" people."
61,I wish I could react normally to feeling ashamed/embarassed,Instead I'm reacting with having the urge to self harm and even end my life.  The rest of my day was fine.  Just one wrong thing I said made me feel really embarrassed and shameful and now I can't stop feeling these urges.  It really sucks.
62,Have I suppressed my emotional pain for so long or do these things just not bother me anymore ?,"Hi. ☺️

I am an extremely emotional person, always have been. I use to find dead birds when I was young and keep them in a box because I thought I could “make them feel better”. I can’t look at homeless people in the eyes because I’ll always remember the face that I couldn’t help at the time. These things I don’t dwell on but they hurt me, not to a point where I cry but I feel pain for helpless, broken and hurt things. 

I’ve suffered a lot of emotional distress most of my life. I was physically abused (hitting, punching, etc...) by my mother up until the age of 10. And physically abused (hitting, pushing, ect..) by my father up until the age of 18. Emotionally abused by the both of them all my life because I don’t remember a time I wasn’t emotionally abused so I assume all my life. I never cried in front of my parents and I also don’t give them a lot of affection. To this day, I feel weird when my mom and dad hug me. Maybe it’s because I only know abuse so I don’t connect with them on that level. It feels weird to say, but I was emotionally abused (manipulated) by my “best friend” for 7 years (grade 1-7) she would get upset with me over the smallest things and I would run to her aid because I felt like I didn’t have any other friends and she was the only one I had so I couldn’t loose her. She once got upset with me that she didn’t become a prefect. Like, she said it was my fault that I didn’t “help her get votes” and i would have to call her on her moms phone and ask her to “forgive me” for upsetting her. Meantime, I can’t remember what I actually did to her, all I could focus on was making sure she was still my friend tomorrow. 

I noticed my mental health was in a dark place about 2 years ago. A guy that I slept with (without a condom) came back about a month after we had sex and said “after we had sex I had a red raw patch on the top of my penis” and I couldn’t explain it because I didn’t think I had anything and I just assumed it was because we had really rough sex over the course of the weekend. Long story short, 3 months down the line, I watched Easy A and the scene where that guy finds out he had chlamydia, it triggered something in me but this excessive worry cake over me that I had something and I kept thinking about this guy who said he had this raw patch after having sex with me just took over my life. For a month, I couldn’t eat, I would sleep, I’d wake up at 3am and just start googling symptoms and worrying about if I have this thing. After that month I had tests done and I was clean for EVERYTHING. During my period of excessive worry, although, I’m aware I was a bit too neurotic, I would seek comfort of reassurance from my parents who would then turn around and get angry at me because I would ask questions about how you contract things and I have this symptom, does it mean anything. I never received that comfort. I was told they would put me away and I was told that I need to stop being neurotic and pathetic. A year ago I watched a movie about HIV and although I had a test done to say I don’t have anything, It still triggered that excessive worry and a panic attack because I thought the test I had done previously missed something. Again, i didn’t have anything but I believe that I have that disorder where you worry you will contact diseases. My mother said I’ve always been like that, when I was young, Before eating or doing anything I would ask my mom if this will make me die. 

My point is: my parents never really sat me down and tried to council me on how I’m feeling and comforted me. With my excessive worry, I would hope they would hug me and let me cry in their arms but I would be told that they’ll put me in a mental hospital, that I’m pathetic, that I’m neurotic, that I can’t worry about something that’s already done because if I have something then why worry about it. You see what I mean, never comfort. 

That was 2 years ago. 

Today, I suffer from a lot of worry and stress. I pick my fingers open when I’m in situations that I feel I don’t have control over. I still worry about contracting diseases. I still perform self checks on my body to ensure nothing is weird or wrong. I check things from STD’s to cancer to mental health. 

Today, I am dealing with the fact that my ability to feel  emotional pain is gone. There is so much that hurts me, that makes me want to cry and I feel the pain in my heart but there is no physical expression of it. I can’t cry about it. My boyfriend and I will have a massive fight and I will just sit there and look at him. I can feel he pain and it hurts me so much but I can’t express it like a normal person, I feel like a robot. 
There are days when I’m at work and something upsets me and I feel my nose tingling because my tears are coming but I immediately suppress them. A lot of people make me feel like my emotions are “nothing” my parents are one of them as explained above I never received parent to child comfort and reassurance that everything will be fine. A year ago I once tried to save a baby bird at work and I went in to get a box and I came back and one of the kids stomped it to death and I sobbed my eyes out because I was trying help it but someone killed it. My colleagues laughed at me for feeling pain towards this little creature I was trying to help. I once had a panic attack at work because a child kicked and bit me and I couldn’t take it and my manager found my crying and was holding back laughter, I saw her trying not to crack a smile, again, making me feel like my emotions are nothing. I saw a doctor in hopes that I could maybe discuss a anti-depressant and I was explaining what happens to me and he turned around and said “oh well have you ever really had an anxiety attack, have you ever really had a panic attack or felt depressed” he had this way about him that made me feel insignificant and that my feelings and emotions are nothing. I know he’s a normal doctor and I should rather go see a psychologist or psychiatrist but why make a face and question me about it like I don’t know what I’m talking about. 

I want to go see a psychiatrist but now I’m too scared to ask my mom because last time I asked her she said to me “medication won’t fix you. You have to do it on your own” some people need medication and maybe the psychiatrist will tell me that I need to fix myself but I should still see a professional. 
When I get a panic attack, I get quite irritated with everything, I pick my fingers open, I cry, I can’t breath. Once I had one do those and my mother told me that I need to see a psychologist because I’m aggressive and I have anger issues and again, she’s not telling me to go see one for myself but she’s telling me because the way I’m feeling is affecting her and other people because I’m aggressive and irritable with other people when I’m worried and stressed and can’t control my head and I’ve got everyone in my space. Again, making me feel like my emotions are nothing and I should see a professional because my feelings and behavior are effecting them. 

For about 6 months, my ability to feel emotional pain is gone. Things that use to hurt me, I don’t feel them anymore, I just sit there and feel numb to the pain. Have I conditioned myself to not feel anything anymore because all of these people have made me feel like I shouldn’t be crying about it or do these things not bother me anymore ?"
63,Today just wasn't good,"Today I just felt really depressed. I haven't felt this bad in quite a long time. Recently I've started and stopped 2 medications, realized I'm toxic, and my relationship isn't going well. I've been trying so hard but I genuinely just can't care about the majority of people. I do feel a little bit of empathy for them but not very much. I've lost the majority of my friends because of this. For some reason though I can get very attached to a few people but I get way too attached and I'm hurting. Everything is starting to hurt more and more every day and I can tell I'm only getting worse."
64,They’re inconsiderate,"I’m by definition not a “nice guy” that part of me has been killed off by the long line of women I trusted that let me down but I get my flaw is what I’m attracted to. I understand and own my mistakes even as I repeat them. My friends, my true friends that I confide in and above all wish that if anyone could understand and accept me it would be them. I accept them unconditionally and live them, which by and far is no small task. I just want a little return. My last relationship hurt me so badly I just want a little consideration but my friends keep twisting the dagger. They get mad at me when they go in the attack talking about my ex and I defend her in any way. I proposed to that woman and gave it my all, when I had to break it off it destroyed me. I hide my feelings so much but I’ve been pretty open about how they depress me pushing shit about my ex. So tonight when they played the song she used to sing to me and I stood up and said “I’ve told you repeatedly this shit depressed me” and my best friend (who I just recently had an in depth talk with about it) tried to say “I mean but did you tell anyone?” And I’m like fine then I’m leaving and her tool of a bf throws up the peace sign........see the old me would have just started hitting him until he was in the hospital but I’m older and trying to be better and explain my feelings and be more open but the level of how inconsiderate they can be just has me removing myself and wanting to disassociate even more. The slow cracking of my second hand heart matches the crumbling of my psyche and the ever looming failing of my waning patience."
65,Any suggestions?,"Dear members of this subreddit,

I was always looking forward to my therapy sessions, but as of lately I’m feeling worse; more depressed, more frequent and intensive mood swings, hallucinations, paranoia and anxiety. I’m no longer seeing the point of therapy. I no longer see it as relieving, soothing and a tool to clarify my conditions/to deal with them. I can’t get out of my bed or my house, my social life is dying and my pets are the only reason I’m still alive. I haven’t felt so horrible since the spring of 2018 when I attempted suicide. Back then I wasn’t using as many meds yet, so my situation should have been better by now, but it’s bad and deteriorating vastly. I’m sort of afraid? Fearful? Of therapy. It seems useless, confusing and confrontational. Life is passing faster than I can handle and I want to just pause it all, yet I can’t. There’s too much going on and happening. All I want is just some peace of mind, a goodnight sleep and away from all the chaos. I’m an introverted person and keep most things to myself, I’ve handled a lot without any help, got clean by quitting cold turkey and am juggling many other things on the side such as uni. I could get through this on my own, but I’m finding it to be a bit more challenging this time, so I’d greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions to help me find the peace I so long for.
Thanks in advance!

Yours truly,

-Cole A."
66,question how many people dont ever have suicidal thoughts?,have you never had a suicidal thought before?
67,I broke up with my bf.,"I broke up with him cause it was not a healthy relationship and I know I did the right thing but I can’t help but think I did something so bad. I don’t really have any friends he was the only one I talked to everyday and now that’s gone.
I know that I don’t want to get back with him but I’m just having a breakdown because I won’t have a friend anymore and I’ll be alone again.. is that selfish to think?"
68,Who else when they look at a video of themselves get the sense that something is off.,I don't know. One of my friends likes to record things during lunch. And whenever I see myself in it I just seem off. Just different and it makes me uncomfortable. I don't know why I even have the friends I do.
69,Do I have anhedonia?,"I am not depressed (I think), nor sad on an average day, but I am basically never happy or excited about anything, and my expression never betrays that (Flat affect? *google*). A big issue here is that I don't feel any comfort or attachment to people I get along with, or have known and have been 'friends' with for years. Do I maybe, specifically, have social anhedonia?"
70,"The concept of existence gives me anxiety attacks. Thoughts like why am i here, and why do we exist? Is life worth living, and does it have any meaning? How do i get over this?","I have a history of depression, but it’s gotten better compared to last year. I’ve been dealing with OCD since I was about 8 years old, and i sometimes struggle with severe anxiety. Coming from an Asian household, mental issues were not really taken seriously."
71,Why am I having stuttering / speech problems at age 25?,"I don't know where else to post this. This mental health sub seems like a reasonable place for this post. Cause I figure that speech is linked to the brain. So technically, this is a mental health issue. 

I'm a male, 25 years old. 

Over the past two years now, I've developed some speech problems that just kinda popped out of nowhere. I guess I would refer to it as stuttering, though that label may be inaccurate. It's not that I necessarily have problems pronouncing things and getting out words. It's that sometimes I literally can't even start a sentence when speaking. Almost like my brain short circuits and I can't get out what I'm trying to say. I would describe it as my brain almost feeling stuck. 

This doesn't happen all the time. Just every now and again. But it is really embarrassing when it happens in a public setting."
72,Social Interaction,"Hiii! Recently, I've been having this feeling of being ignored and the worst case is having to receive bad thoughts from my close friends.

When I was in elementary, I used to be a very quiet type of person and often shy. So when I knew that I would be transferring schools in high school, I took it as a chance to be someone else. I became so tired of being in everyone's shadow. I tried to grow in every aspect, most especially in terms of scoial interaction. But now that I would be entering college, I realized that it is better to live a quiet life than to experience a toxic one. It felt like every word you say and every reaction you make is a big deal.

I would like to ask for some advice on how to deal with people who keeps on saying offensive words as a joke or being to direct on their thoughts to the point that they often hurt the feelings of others."
73,Depression &amp; Cleaning / Self Care,
74,Hmm,Just a thought I definitely feel like the sperm right behind me should’ve swam a little bit faster I feel like had they survived they would have a much more successful life and they wouldn’t have been a waste of space like I am😌 I just think about that sometimes
75,Why don’t I eat?,"I don’t have body issues, but whenever I’m spiralling I always forget to eat, or can’t be bothered to. It’s funny how used to being hungry I am, that after a few minutes my hunger goes away. Today, I ate a peanut butter sandwich, 6 olives, and I drank a cup of coffee. I feel fine physically. I don’t know how my body is still holding up honestly, with the amount of times I just don’t eat. Sometimes I go to school without eating breakfast and I don’t eat for the entire day, and I’m so used to that I’m not even hungry anymore. I don’t understand."
76,Struggling to live with myself,"I have grown to hate myself, and it has reached a point where I find it difficult to be with myself. I'm either infuriated with or ashamed of my past, my behavior, and my actions, and have lost faith in my most basic cognitive faculties. When something goes right, I begin to catastrophize and even convince myself that something will go wrong. When something goes wrong, I actually feel relieved because I felt like I got what I deserved and I don't have to pretend otherwise. Besides a genuinely amazing and loving family that I'm truly thankful for, there is nothing about my past or my background that I feel any connect towards; in fact, I actively distance myself from it to the point of active deception. And there is nothing that I look forward to in my future because I know that something will go wrong -  this proclivity for self-sabotage has ruined my objectives and relationships. I'm sick and tired of going through this over and over again. My circumstances haven't been the best but they haven't been terrible either; in fact, as a college student, the past few months have actually been motivating because I've had opportunities come my way. And yet, I'm convinced that people will realize I'm not good enough for this and it'll all be snatched away (so will the constant anxiety of being ""found out""). I don't think I will take any drastic step but if something were to happen, I probably wouldn't mind it. At this point, I can't stand myself, and I really want to get away, escape, and exit, if possible."
77,Substance cravings while happy,"Hey everyone, 

I have BPD, ADHD, major depression, anxiety, and possible Bipolar. When I am really depressed, I get cravings for drugs or alcohol (usually weed). However, I've been in a good mood the past few days and started having those cravings again. I think it may be because my mood is so extreme either way (either super depressed or super happy) and it's just a lot to deal with so I try to find something to help me get out of my head. 

Does anyone else deal with these cravings even when you're happy?"
78,Anorexia and depression,My best friend has those both things and I really care and worry about her. We often don't understand each other but we usually don't argue about it. Lately we argue more and more often. I'm trying to cheer her up then but I feel like I'm making it even worse. Every my word matters how she will react and it's result is really often negative. We chat in messenger so it makes things easier and harder in the same time. If you can give me some kind of advise how to speak with her and don't hurt her. Sorry for bad english.
79,Sometimes I feel like I just need to go crazy,"I just get so....passionate. Idk I probably have a flair for drama, but, especially when I’m drunk, I get so angry about everything. People in my life. The state of the world, etc, I get so fucking angry and if I wasn’t isolating myself during these ucndents I could see myself starting fights, unfortunately possibly getting violent.

Luckily I have some self control and ability to know that I’m not in a stable state of mind, so I’m able to control myself, but just the fact I have this capability and potential to be *so angry* worries me. Is there something really wrong with me? Is this normal? I get so worried I’m going to make a big mistake in one of these “incidents” and fuck up my life, or some one else’s.

If it matters I’m a 22 year old guy, maybe this is just an age thing."
80,Inner monologue voice,"This is weird and kind of hard to describe but it’s like my inner voice doesn’t sound like my voice sometimes. It’s my thoughts but said in someone else’s voice. It’s a voice I remember from like an actor or a singer. I’m not hearing multiple voices or any voices that aren’t me, but it’s like my inner voice doesn’t sound like my external voice. Like a voice I’ve memorized by accident. This thing just happened where I couldn’t stop thinking in a different voice from my own. It really bothered me because it feels like I can’t control my thought because when you think of something it’s there and you can’t just stop thinking about it. I’m blasting music to try and forget it. Does anyone have any ideas of what or why this happened?"
81,"Currently in an hour long panic attack, need help.","I’ve been in a panic attack for the past hour, I just found out I have work tomorrow morning which isn’t helping. I’ve been having thoughts of suicide with this panic attack. I would NEVER actually comit suicide, I know that effects of that on my family and I don’t want to die.  I just want these thoughts out of my head. Some help"
82,My psychologist can't take a hint,"I've been going to psychologist for some time and one thing that fucking destroys me is my parents. That's why I ended up there.

I've told her many times and many stories about them destroying my life and not caring

But guess fucking what, she clearly can't take a hint that I don't want them in my life. That renewing our relationship would only destroy me more.

They're in toxic marriage and have been always bringing it on us. They even had audacity to say that it's my fault.

She's making me write letter to them and to include what do I want, what do I feel is missing

And she clearly can't take a hint that I don't want to do that. I've tried so many times and even tried talking with them and everything, but they just didn't care. They only cared about others opinions.

I wanted to fucking kill myself because of them


She can't take the hint that I don't want to renew something that has been renewed so many times, but still destroyed my the same, exact behaviour

And is it the role of 14 year old kid to tell parents how to be a parent? I don't fucking think so"
83,My story (content warning: possible abuse and definite suicidal ideation),"My earliest memory is of being abused. It's so vague that I question that it actually happened. I don't remember the abuser's face. In my memory, they're just a dark figure. I don't remember specific actions, or occurrences, but I do remember going into a room. And something I didn't like happening in that room.

Sometimes I would wake up without my underwear on. I don't know if I took them off myself in my sleep, or if someone did it to me. I tend to take clothes off if I get hot, and I don't remember doing it, but. I don't know.

I feel like I'm fucked up and I'm making things up. I feel like I had occuring, extremely fucked up nightmares and I'm trying to blame innocent family. But sometimes things don't add up.

My parents divorced when I was young. My dad, I've come to learn, is an extremely manipulative and mentally abusive man. My mom couldn't handle it any more and got the fuck out. I lived with her for a while, and in high school I thought I found the love of my life.

I came out as a lesbian when I was 16. I was confident and comfortable with it. My mom accepted me. I found a girl who I thought was a great person and human being. Nothing could stop us. But love was blind. She eventually planted a seed in my mind that my mom wasn't good. That my family was strange and bad for me. I spent less time with my family after graduation. She said my friends didn't like me. That they talked about me behind my back. I spent less time with my friends. I only spent time with her. If I talked to anyone else she would get mad. She convinced me that I was probably transgender. She wanted me to change my body so she could love me better. I did everything to ""transition"" except for hormones and surgery. This made me feel horrible. I felt like a liar. Because, after much thought, I know I'm not trans. I'm a woman. At the time, I was convinced, though. 

I mostly stayed indoors at this time in my life. I stopped all of my hobbies. I dropped out of college. I buried myself in video gaming as escapism. I was miserable.

I got hospitalized for attempting suicide. I tried to set myself on fire, dousing myself in the alcohol she loved so fucking much. In some fucked up way, she must have loved me somehow, because she had the decency to talk me down and drive me to the hospital.

The nicest thing she did for me was dumping me after I got out. At the time it was devastating. She was all that I had. I thought I would do better, be better, that we could make it. Now I realize that she wasn't good. For anybody.

2-3 years pass.

I moved back in with my dad and brother. I lived there for a time, but I moved out due to a travelling job I no longer have, and my dad gave the house to my brother. I learned recently that my dad had hidden surveillance cameras in the house without my or my brother's knowledge. My brother found them during his cleaning of the house after I moved out.

As a kid I always felt like I was being watched. I thought I was just paranoid. Maybe I am. But this new development isn't helping.

I'm now living with my mother and step dad because I'm so fucked up that I can't hold a job for long. Without them I'd be homeless.

I feel like a leech. I don't have a job, I do art on the side. It doesn't pay much. Each time I try to get help, like a therapist or sign up for financial help, I have panic attacks. Phone calls scare me. Even typing this scares me. Even though it's anonymous, I'm frightened by the prospect of talking to people or making connections. Because I don't want to disappoint anyone. And I will. Eventually. And I'm afraid. Because every time I try to make friends, they end up being terrible. There are two exceptions, and I will hold on to those two wonderful human beings until the day I die. I'm thankful for them.

I don't know why I'm typing this. Probably because I know I'll never be able to get therapy. I feel like I can't tell anyone this. And right now I'm struggling. I feel like I'm a waste of space, and I feel like I'm a lost cause. Cursed at birth. I don't know what to do. I need help but I feel so fucking lost. I don't want to kill myself, but I'm so tired of living in constant fear and emptiness.

Please tell me that there's something worth living for."
84,Is it possible to become so mentally ill that thinking of getting better can’t happen?,"i don’t know. my mom always says you have to choose to be happy and i’m just really lazy, and it’s felt in the past that it’s sort of degrading how i feel. i’m just trying to make some sense of what’s really applicable or not."
85,Low time,"It's Valentine's day, and I'm fired from my job id tried so hard to get and harder to stay on, because I had a test in school at the same time. No calls back, just deleted shifts. I thought I had a shred more of respect around the place, I guess I thought wrong. 

How could it get worse? I found out today also that I'm pretty sure really just dont like sex (hot take), again, on Valentine's day. I think I'm cursed and really just want to move into a van at this point."

87,Completely stuck,"So, I have been meaning to post this somewhere for a long time, this account is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

So I am a male in my early 20's and for everyone to understand the context of the story, we need to scroll back to the early 2000's which was the time I was a kid.   


I lived with my father, mother and sister and our financial situation was rather bad, since I am from a post-soviet country and salaries were still extremely low back then. We were moving from one rental appartment to another and getting kicked out due to not paying timely. It was because my father was a casino addict and also besides that, extremely verbally abusive towards my mother (never physical violence though). He would take money that was donated (by my relatives and acquaintance to buy clothes and a baby stroller etc.) to me and turn it into dust in slot machines, not to mention at least half of his every salary. But you know, as a little boy you are just told that daddy is working out late tonight. And you think nothing of it, I think I did not realise how bad this was until I turned like 12, but by then my father had quit gambling. I was also sexually abused by a close relative and also some friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I was always extremely intelligent, I read a lot, world class adult literature. I could read and understand everything, since as a child and throughout school I was my mothers confidant, she did not have many friends and she would tell me all her secrets about her life and what she was going through etc. I went to comfort her when she was crying after my father had been yelling at her and so on. That gave me a good insight into adult life back then, even though I might have been 8 or so.

  
At school in the earlier years I was bullied because of my weight and lisp that I cannot control, I was trying to be as friendly as I could to everybody, but no one wanted to be around me, it made me really sad. But I had my toy animals at home, who all had names and I played with them, imagining that I am on some far away adventure in the Middle Earth or exploring the caverns below Hogwarts etc. It gave me hope and security, it gave me friends, even though they were all in my head.   


By the end of middle school, the bullying had stopped, people were smart and had grown out of it. It was also the time that my parents went through a really messy divorce that took months to settle down, stop my father from stalking me and my mum and my mums friends (Not stalking maliciously, but just like ""Can i speak to you, we really need to speak about my ex-wife who is now trying to destroy my life""). After the divorce, me and my mom moved from one of her friends houses, to another one until we settled in a small furnace-heated apartment in a cheap bad neighbourhood, but soon after my mom found love again and since 16 i started living alone. I had all my bills paid and got a medium sized allowance to eat and go to the movies etc. I also made the friends back then that are the friends who have stuck with me for my lifetime.

At high school I was pretty lazy, I discovered drinking and smoking pot, both of which i did daily for years until I was perhaps 19. Pot still stays with me, but not the drinking, that was a real problem back then since I was basically binge drinking alone, just loved the feeling of being drunk and lighting a cigarette or sth like passing out after a bottle of gin and a big joint. It made me feel numb and delirious which i felt was the preferred mental state. I still somewhat think that, but don't do it anymore since the alcohol physical side-effects are too nasty, now i just have 2-3 beers 1-2times per week which I don't see as much of a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

For my whole life my biggest dream has been just going backpacking, travelling the world and discovering distant places, being on the road and never settling down, living with different religious or ethnical groups or learn different skills, languages etc. I thought I will do that right after I finish university in 2020 spring. My best friend of 8 years is sharing this plan with me, he is a person who is the closest to me in my life, has always been and always will be since he has always been there for me 100%, we grew into adults together, we have done so much stupid shit and shared so many great memories together etc. He is like a brother to me, would not trade him for any other person in this world.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the end of high school I found the first girlfriend of my life. It was an instant match and in 1 month we were living together. She has moved here from southeast asia and we were totally inseparable for a long time. But after the initial super mad love phase cooled down, I felt like I feel more complete with my friends and stopped appreciating the fact that this could be a long term relationship. Since this person is older than me and has already travelled the world and seen many different places and lived in many different countries, she wants to settle here now since she likes it here and has a great job. I on the other hand quit uni 2 times in order to work full time so that I could live together with her.  


I have been trying to explain her that our lives are at completely different stages and even though we have a blast together, we don't last most likely that well since if I commit to this relationship, I will lose all the dreams i made with my best friend and vice versa also. And this relationship is important to me as well.  But for me going travelling would not be like just goofing around for a couple of months, but actually living on the road.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides that one friend I have, I had 2 more like him that i felt the same way about, very close to me and extremely good to me for a long time. They are already living like that and I envy every second I see some photos taken in myanmar or thailand or etc and think that I could be there not doing this lame office job that I have. And the one friend I have here currently is stuck due to something mandatory that will end in autumn, after which he said he is also going to join the other friends, with or without me (after I explained my position).  


I feel I am absolutely torn apart, I would lose my friends and the dream I had my whole life, or I would lose my girlfriend who is also amazingly good to me and we share love together. I have tried on multiple times explaining this to my girlfriend also that maybe it would be better for us to walk separate ways as friends since neither of us can support each others future, but she always gets so emotional and totally plays me into staying with her, I guess she knows too well what my soft spots are. And also she has almost no one here besides me since she is a foreigner.

  
And I honestly don't know what to do, I want to leave so badly, I dont want to leave my girlfriend, but at this point its quite clear in my head that the wish to fulfil my dream is bigger than the wish to be in the relationship. I am honestly heartbroken, this girl means a lot to me, but like its this kind of moment where you have a Girlfriend for 3 years vs 3 best friends for 8 years living the dream that you have been wanting to do your whole life.   


It has been driving me absolutely crazy for the last couple of months so I decided to move apart from my gf, but to continue the relationship, so I still hang out with her 4 or so times per week and feel quite healthy about that, just needed some room, she was upset at first, but is cool with it now. But I don't know what to do, I feel like every time I see her I would be with her forever, but every time I see my friends, I can't wait to pack my bags and hop on a plane with them to some far far away land. I honestly feel like just dying would be easier, I don't want to be put in front of this dilemma, when I went into the relationship (age 19), I took it as a casual romantic relationship, not some long term commitment, I mean ofc I understood that things got serious, but at the same time I was completely oblivious about the future, I did not understand that she wants to settle down in some city family area and just have good job, good salary, office, etc. Which for me is just boring af

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I guess at this point I am just ranting but you get my situation, I am torn apart and heartbroken and feel like everything would be so much easier if I would be just dead, but I am not in any way a suicidal person, but I feel like just secretly selling all my stuff, going to the airport. Deleting my social media (which I basically don't use since my friends don't even have smartphones and we always meet for chatting and talking about life, music, literature etc.), throwing my phone in the bin and going anywhere and starting a new life somewhere else.   


I could keep going but I just needed to vent here, please share your opinions etc. It was all just written in a big run, so it can sound a bit all over the place, sorry about that."
88,Hello There,"I apologize for not being very descriptive in the title, as I really don't know how to title this. I've had mental health issues since my early teens that have gradually worsened over the past few years, from mild anxiety and depressive moods, to outright suicidal thoughts and panic attacks on a semi-regular basis. I've also been hallucinating, mostly whispers and indecipherable babble, with one morning, waking up from a nightmare hearing screaming for the next half hour. I'm not in a good place and haven't been in a long time. I haven't seen a therapist or psychiatrist since September, doesn't help that what would be described as a tragedy only happen a few months earlier. No meds. Multiple hospitalizations over the years. Horrible circumstances in living in all but close to six years of my 21 years rotating on the globe. I'm far past my breaking point and I'm running on fumes. I don't know how much longer I can keep going, my situation shows no real sign in improving, infact, it looks like its only going to worsen within the next few weeks alone. I never thought I'd live this long, and, not saying this as a pessimist, I have no clue how far I'll go, but I'm just so lost and aimless. I really don't know anymore."
89,i had a mental breakdown a couple days ago and i’ve felt numb since,"the other day i had a mental breakdown and to put it simply, it was bad. however, i noticed that since then i haven’t felt anything properly. i’m not sad but i’m not happy either, i’m just sort of there. i can’t think of any other way to put it except for feeling empty and numb. does anyone know what this is or why it’s happened? i sort of prefer to feel like this if i’m honest but i don’t know how long it’ll last"
90,Just need a place to vent,"Never been much to vent or share my thoughts but I’m just in a really bad place and need some advice. warning- bit of a rant

So i’m 17, Australian and Year 12 (final year of high school) and i’m really struggling. i’ve got a lot of leadership stuff and obviously academic pressure but it’s mainly my rowing that’s causing me pain. 
For most of the season i’ve been in the top crew, which was doing really well. Late november last year, my knee was in bad shape. Doctors didn’t know if i’d row again, mri’s, ultrasound, surgery, a lot. had 2 months to try recover and then get fit to get back there. 

Came back able to row pain free, wasn’t allowed to test bc my fitness would be lower than those the hadn’t been injured and got put in the second eight. did an 2k erg trial last week smashed my erg score and testing wise i got back into first eight scores. and yet i wasn’t put into it. they kept me in the second eight and no idea why. told that my chance would come and to keep waiting

i’ve done everything they’ve asked, and the guy who is now in my seat is also injured. he still can’t row every session because of pain in his wrist, but i’m stronger, fitter and row better than him. he doesn’t even go to the physio sessions laid out for him

it’s been months of me absolutely slaving myself trying to do anything i can to get back and now that i could have that chance in my final year and the fact that i keep getting lied to about having a chance that’s now being thrown away, it hurts so badly. it’s gotten to the point that everything else in my life is crashing down too because i’ve given so much to my rowing for nothing in return. on a three week camp we had, i cried myself to sleep each night because i wanted to get back and knew i could be there, but there wasn’t anything i could do to change it

honestly feels like i’m running into a brick wall each day then getting up and doing it again the next. don’t know if i can get back up anymore

the race that matters is in 5 weeks from today, but any advice that anyone can give is greatly appreciated. just really struggling with coping is all

tl:dr struggling with giving my rowing everything i have and keep getting denied a place in the top crew for no apparent reason and it’s tearing everything else down and i don’t know what to do"
91,Dont know where to post this,"I'm having trouble making friends who actually care about what I talk about and listen and are interested in the same things I am.... I feel like I'm just a weirdo who's into so many things but I cont seem to find common ground with others when it comes to hobbies. I love drones (fpv), retro games, microscopy, drums, mlp, imma furry, and gaming and game design. 3D animation/ modeling/texturing. And lastly, sound design... I can't find anyone IRL, not over a screen who is willing to be friends with me... I really feel as if no one cares about my opinion not even my partner at times.

Yes, before your comment I am seeing a psychologist.

I'm an ex foster kid since I was 3 and the recent family I was with didn't make me feel too included so that could also be it.... Honestly don't know why I'm posting this here... I guess I just don't know how to make friends and as a 25-year old. That's kinds embarrassing.

And it dosn't help that my partner is also a paranoid person. And when ever i make friends i feel like she scares them away... Or is always suspicious that I'm having relations with them but I'm not I'm just trying to make friends.... If you made it this far thanks for reading... Again i don't know why i put this here but i so want to ask 

Is is always hard to make a good friend?"
92,Why are subs like these ALLOWED?,"Have you ever heard of the antipsychiatry movement? 

It's basically a scientology cult that denies the existence of mental illness and anything that has to do with psychology and psychiatry. Things like these could greatly affect us. Some people need help out there and they just oppose it. It's sick.

This subreddit: r/antipsychiatry describes it."
93,How do I stop talking about my problems to people?,"Diagnosis: Depression and anxiety

I am too honest for my own good. Everytime a friend asks me how I am doing, I tell them I am not coping and start giving them details of my mental health issues. I can virtually see the life drain from their faces as I elaborate on my troubles and insecurities. Eventually I ask them how they are doing, and they are so tired by then that they only muster up one ""good thanks"".

I feel like I am burdening my friends with my troubles. I really wish I could put on a fake smile and say ""good thanks"" but I just can't. Not only do I feel insincere but I also hate pretending that my life is perfect when it is nowhere near it. It is something that is beyond my control and happens automatically and goes on for too long before I realise what is happening. If I need help, I want to ask for help. But at this point I feel like I am just using all my friends as punching bags.

What is the right thing to do here? Should I tell my friends about my problems? Generally I do it only to vent, not look for solutions as I don't see any. Or should I keep my feelings hidden so as to not ruin their vibe? A lot of them also tell me to think positively and stop focusing on the negatives. 

Any and all comments are appreciated. TIA."
94,I can never explain this properly,"Hello! I'm 14 and live in Sweden.
I want to talk about my mental health I guess? I don't know..
Ask me questions, give me advice, anything..

I will try not to go into much detail here, but instead when I'm responding to comments.

Here's a list of my psychological problems:


•When I'm writing something, let's say this post, it slowly just becomes incoherent nonsense. I just loose focus completely. Same thing when speaking, but not as bad.

I have a really hard time doing even very small projects on my own, like writing this post. I've tried to write this many times but it never works.

Is it just me being very tired?


•I have been diagnosed with Asperger's/ASD at BUP (basically just psychologists for kids and teens). The oversensitivity and communication problems make me tired and confused. Also I can't see the whole picture of basically anything without extreme focus, I think it's because I can't filter out the details.

•At BUP I also got diagnosed with ""särbegåvning"" which means I'm smart. It measured 5 different things, one being how many things you can remember at once, that I was pretty bad at.
My mom told me she had read that this combined with Asperger's was difficult in school or something. That makes sense, knowing everything in school but not being able to show it is very annoying.

•I probably have some form of OCD. I like sorting things, spend like 5 minutes searching for spiders like I had arachnophobia whenever I use the toilet, and thoroughly clean the family computer when my younger brother has used it. But I barely care about my own hygiene for some reason...

•Depression. Yes I do know like all teenagers think they have depression and other stupid stuff.... I know that free online tests and strangers on discord are unreliable sources.. The psychologists didn't seem to think there was a big enough possibly I had it either...
I have pretty much all of the symptoms except for being suicidal.
It started 4 years ago when I got new classmates so I didn't know anyone, and a new terrible teacher, and I wasn't diagnosed with ASD yet so that was a big problem. I got so tired that when I got home I would go directly to bed, sometimes even without taking off shoes and stuff. My parents would bring food directly to my room, which they still do.
My younger brother was really annoying, he used a lot of body language, which was annoying because of ASD, picked his nose, lots of small stuff but extremely annoying for me. Turns out he also have ASD..
Being so tired and lazy could also be depression.

•Depersonalization
I have all the symptoms and it can be caused by depression.
My dad doesn't think I have it.

•PTSD
I don't know what to write here

•The psychologists thought I might have ADHD, not much to say about it but I think everyone are more productive when they've been outside. That doesn't mean I'm outside often.


Some much more farfetched things I probably don't have:

•Bipolar
•Psychosis
•Carbon monoxide poisoning
•being a psychopath
•Multiple personality disorder
•very bad whatever the thing connecting the two brain hemispheres is called


My parents and the doctor think to not be tired I should be outside more, and my parents also think I should use my phone less. When I don't use my phone there's no big difference, I've tried. I haven't been without my phone for more than a week though, but that's impossible.


I've tried to write stuff like this many times but every time I think it's silly nonsense, which it ends up being, so I'd delete it. It feels like I can't do anything about it. (No, you don't have to point out that this is a sign of depression. Wait it is right?)


I think I've written enough now"
95,Describe what chronic depression feels like.,"I've struggled with chronic depression since I was 15.

It's easy for a lot of people to hide it when it's cyclical especially when you worry about feeling like a burden on the people in your life.

A few months ago, a friend committed suicide... for most people it seemed out of nowhere, but hearing people talk about how happy she was all the time made me realize that being open can build important support systems.

So, I tried to describe what depression feels like and how my brain works in an episode and I wanted to hear from other people as well."
96,"When you have been ghosted from a friend without knowing why, and after a lot of time has passed they reach out to you out of the blue like nothing happened.","I’ve been ghosted before, and as you can probably imagine it doesn’t feel nice at all. You start getting questions in your head: What did I do? What did I say? etc.   

The story behind this is that I had a really good friend throughout high school; we did everything together. When school finished and we both went to separate universities (mine was closer to home, he went to one interstate), we promised each other we would keep in touch and catch up whenever we could. Long story short, over time my texts would go unanswered (even when it said that he had seen them). At first I put this down to the fact that he’s most likely pretty busy with uni, and does not have as much time as we used to when it comes to talking.   

But then I went onto social media one day to look him up to get an idea of what kind of things he was up to, only to not find his name anywhere, not even on my friends list. In other words, he had most likely blocked me. Now that was really painful to find out. It took me a good while to get over it and move on.  

Fast forward six years later to today and out of nowhere I get a friend request from him. At first I was pleasantly surprised, until I started to remember why I hadn’t heard from him in so long. He had cut me off with no explanation, and now all of a sudden he thinks he can reach out to me and just be friends again?? I haven’t accepted his request yet, and I don’t think I really want to, but I feel as if that means I’m dwelling too much on the past and that I haven’t really moved on and am just being selfish (or probably the other way around). Maybe it’s just because of the history we have idk.   

Has anyone been in a similar situation??"
97,I want to kill myself but I can’t bc it would destroy my gf,"I absolutely hate my life. I’ve had a traumatic pst I don’t want to get into but understand my family life is shit, i can’t be happy without being with my gf or being high, and I am diagnosed with depression anxiety and add. 
All I want is the ability to be naturally happy or at least not permanently sad unless i force myself to feel some sort of positive feeling by getting high or being with my gf to release dopamine and serotonin that I desperately need. The only thing that is keeping me from doing it is my gf. I love her and I never want to leave her but every day I have suicidal thoughts and emotions and I just want to end it. I feel like everything is pointless and no matter what I do it won’t get better. Prescriptions, therapy, hobbies don’t work. I don’t eat or sleep much anymore and always feel anxious and sad.
I don’t think there’s much left on this world to enjoy or at least that I’m capable of enjoying and if I keep going I’ll probably end up like my dad or his dad: a lonely alcoholic. 
I can’t kill myself because I’m afraid it will cause my gf to break mentally and possibly kill herself too. Idk what to do I can’t let go of her but I can’t stop thinking about being released from my living hell. Anyway thanks for listening to my rant. I feel like such a terrible person I got the sweetest most perfect amazing person stuck with me. Every year it just gets worse and worse. I’m so tired and exhausted idk if I can do this much longer. If you’re gonna comment please don’t say it gets better because that’s bullshit"
98,"Oh boy, this is super embarrassing to say out loud, but I really need help managing my weight loss when depression/ a lack of care is holding me back.","I am as a teenager, 2 deaths in my very very close family made me quite depressed and uncaring about many things in my life, I chose food as a distraction and am now super overweight. (And I mean medically overweight around 90 lbs over what I should be) I really would like to be better, but my motivation is still nowhere to be found. I know I need to change and I know how, but I always end up not caring enough to keep going I say, who cares we're all gonna die some day anyways, or something to that extent. Family won't change with me, so constantly I am around people who snack/make unhealthy choices. My insecurities about my weight and how I look make me only feel worse, but depression feels like its holding me down from changing Is there any tips people can give besides, ""just eat less"" or ""you just have to stick to it!"" I tried going to a therapist, but she would never really give straight answers about it, so I was hoping for some help here. If anyone has an idea it would be very much appreciated! Thanks! 😖🖤💕 (ps: I am really not looking how to get thin quick or things like that, I just need to know some of your tips to stop being lazy and/or keeping the decision to get out of bad food/lazy habits due to depression)"

102,"For Mental Health Awareness Month in May, I am doing a presentation at work about mental health! Would love some ideas about what to include.","Last year I feel like my presentation was a bit long, but people really loved it. I went over the following things:

- Recognizing and fighting mental health stigma
- How to listen to or help someone who is going through a hard time 
- Recognizing work stress and tips to overcome it 
- Types of therapy (CBT, psychodynamic...)
- Tips for finding a therapist using our work insurance 

This year I plan to have my coworkers do an anonymous survey to get a better idea of what they’d like to learn about.

I also think I’d like to go over some psychological concepts or cognitive fallacies, like black/white thinking, how to recognize and combat those.

Lastly I think I’d like to go over “what’s normal?” to help people see that if/when they have negative feelings (stress, inadequacy, self-doubt, etc) that those feelings are normal. Or maybe just some facts about emotions in general (like the role of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex when it comes to emotional regulation)

104,I’m worried about my girlfriend.,"This doesn’t happen often but when it does it’s scary. I’ll start in order. One night she busted into tears panicking that there were people outside her window and that they were coming to hurt her, and I finally got her to calm down and take some breaths, then it was like she had a switch flipped. I was talking, saying it was gonna be okay and her voice went deep and she said “hello??” In a concerned voice, so obviously I said hi back and she asked who I was. That’s when my stomach sank. I told her I was her boyfriend and that her name was Kennie and that I loved her. She had no idea what was going on. She snapped out of it a few seconds later and started sobbing again. It was agonizing to hear, knowing she was in pain. Everything was fine for about a month other than the occasional hallucinations of people in her window until about 30 minutes ago when she quickly got up and said she had to leave the room. I was kinda sus but just thought maybe she had to pee or something until I heard her stop at the stairs, so I went to get her and she turned back to me, holding in sobs again. I took her back to our bed and rested her head on my lap for a few minutes and everything was okay. I thought maybe she had fallen asleep, so I kissed her forehead and she started talking in a deep voice again. I think there was something inside her. It was saying “she’s mine, she doesn’t love you.” And that they were gonna hurt her, throw her down the stairs, they were burning her from the inside out. Then she went back to normal. Now she’s crying again telling them to stop and I’m getting scared. Her older sister was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and auditory and visual schizophrenic delusions. Her parents sent her to the hospital and she hadn’t seen her in 3 years. She’s refusing to tell anyone because she doesn’t want to end up like her sister but I don’t know what to do anymore. I wish I could be more helpful. I’m trying my hardest."

106,A light in the tunnel,"I have finally crossed some things off the essentials list for things I need to do to get better:

\- got a new family doctor (I moved and it's took 3mths of feeling sorry for myself, then 2 mths of being laid up due to a physical illness that led to surgery, and 1.5mths of trying to find a doctor to get there)

\- back onto previous medications, with promise of adjustments as needed in the future (if they find new ones that have come out since then would work better)

\- going to be referred to a psychiatrist and using community services to get a health care/life team together to help me get my life back, slowly - I'm going to try my best not to get ahead of myself and jump into life too soon 

\- that person will help me rebuild my relationships my illness have destroyed, help my spouse and family set boundaries with me finally, rules and guidelines that I need to respect and adhere to. the past while it's been too easy for me to pull the ""illness"" card, and that's not fair, but who tells a sick person that they're being an asshole? not many people. I think I've made it far even coming to realize that I was using them as emotional punching bags during all my volatile swings (this is where I want to focus when the meds stabilize me)

\- I'm going back to school in the fall, finding a new career that won't overstimulate my brain, as amazing as I was at advertising and marketing, I need work that I don't take home with me at the end of the day, at least for a while. I know it can take 5+ years for people to get stable with bipolar, and I want to get there. Going to school will also give me time to heal, but still allows me to feel I'm doing something productive without jumping into the 9-5 too soon. I do plan on trying to dip my feet into part time work while I get settled into school. 

\- lastly, realizing how lucky I am. How lucky I am to live in a country that has an amazing socialist system that allows for me to take a year off work and get paid to get healthy (running out soon, but I have a plan in place to extend that), that will pay for my school tuition, and where I don't have to pay for healthcare. I always had sympathy for people who found themselves on the streets (not sure the proper term for this; didn't want to use 'homeless'), but seeing that if I didn't have these systems in place, if I didn't have family who could take myself and my husband into their home that I would have been a statistic, and on the streets...I have a renewed passion for finding ways to help that situation. I am lucky, and I need to start counting the blessings I do have. 

Thanks to everyone who read, commented and the people who reached out via messaging to make sure I was okay. I went from suicidal on here, through to psychosis moments, low moments, high moments and now, I'm going to get better. I know I can. I can do this. Thank you for making me feel less alone. 

I know it won't be linear healing, and that I will likely have setbacks, but I have a team now to help me navigate those. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm going to get better, I have a plan, and a team and I will beat this. The demons can go to heck."
107,"My insurance wants me to check into inpatient care, should I listen to them?","Long story short, I just got out of a seven day involuntary hold in a mental hospital which was not a pleasant stay at all.  I feel like I got out of jail.  However what sent me there, suicidal ideation, hasn't went away.  Now it's getting worse.  My insurance has a warmline I've been using and I've had no less than three people on it tell me to check into a mental hospital.  I assume this is because they're afraid of liability issues.  I've told them about my bad experiences and they assure me there's better hospitals in my network.  They're even calling me asking if I'm going to check in.  Should I listen to them?  I can't live my life in and out of mental hospitals, but I dont know what else I'm supposed to do."
108,I don't know what's wrong with me,"For years now I've hated myself, I hate my personality, the way I talk, the way I look, even the way I move, just anything that you can possibly hate about yourself. I always put it up to the usual teenage depressions that most people get but something about this doesn't feel normal. My self loathing has gotten to the point where I'm, or at least I feel like I am, losing all of my friends. I can't make new friends and if i happen to do so I'm always on edge and I can't act normal. It makes me feel like i'm being fake, like everything i do is a lie even though I'm trying to be as myself as i can be. I never talk in the group chat with most of my friends in because I'm terrified of getting left on read or offending someone or being boring or just saying the wrong thing. I feel like that's put a strain on our friendships and that none of them actually like me. I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I've talked to them about it before and they say that they love me but I don't *feel* like they do. 

I realise that they have no reason to lie to me, unless they're too nice to let me off gently, so the problem must be all in my head, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm still actually ruining our friendships. It's all my fault that this is happening because I can't talk to anyone without stressing and making things awkward. My silence has started to have the opposite effect of solving things and is just making a bigger gap between me and my friends where I feel like they just think I'm boring or stupid. 

And what if it is literally all in my head? What's wrong with me then? Trust issues? Social anxiety? Depression? It feels wrong to diagnose it because I can't help but feel as though I'm just being a baby, nothing is actually wrong with me, it's all just hormones and I'll grow out of it eventually.  But when i look at all of my peers i'd say that most of them don't experience this, at least to the same level as I do based off of how they act and talk. I'm not saying this because I want to be like ""boo hoo my life is so sad, pity me"", I'm saying it because I genuinely feel like this isn't normal to so much of an extent based on things I've heard from the people around me. 

Has anyone else experienced similar feelings? And does anyone know what might be the problem?"
109,How can I work on not getting so attached to people?,"So I tend to have a habit of attaching to anyone (opposite sex mainly) who start talking to me for more than a couple of days. 
For example there is a girl who I’ve been talking to for 6 months or so and these days she’s really the only one I’ll talk to..even though she’ll half ghost me for days at a time.
By no means is she obligated to talk to me, but for me it feels like she is the world and I have some weird jealously attached to that. Constantly does things like send out “Someone chat?” While not even opening my last message.

I guess I get so attached because it’s good to have someone there, or at least for me to think they are there while going through all the crap depression brings. Has anyone else been in this situation and how can I manage it?"
110,How do I get out of this circle?,"I have been in a circle for many years. 

I hook up with a girl on a party (it doesn't need to involve sex) and as soon she gives me some sort of confirmation I'm like hardcore in love and can't stop thinking of that person. 

Shit like that happens at parties and it usually end there. And since I caught feeling as soon as a got some sort of confirmation, the weeks after feels like shit, I'm like heart broken even if I just met that person for an evening. 

After I get heartbroken my depression and anxiety just spiral down to infinity, I cut myself, foggy mind, suicidal thoughts etc. I cant laugh, I cant smile, I cant feel anything than pain. 
And then It repeats it self, it's like I fall after just one compliment. Sometimes I hook up with someone just to forget the other person and yeah it starts all over again


I've been in a relationship with a girl for over 2 years so I'm not super lonely or never been with a girl
Many say I'm good looking
Can make almost anyone laugh

I lived like this for many years. SSRI doesn't work, spent lot of time on therapy, doesn't do any major difference. Only think that works is drugs but I feel like that is not a sustainable alternative 
I suffered from depression and PTSD for my whole life, doctors say I can't be ""fixed""

I can not stop going to parties, and I think stop interacting with women is a bad idea. How do I stop falling for everyone


Suicidal male, 21"
111,I’m so tired of being the “good child”,"It’s late at night by the time I’m writing this. I’m in bed and tears are still coming down my face. My head already hurts from tension. I feel so so f***ing horrible and I can’t let anyone who knows me know, especially my mother. I don’t know if this is my limit and if it is I’m scared. I’m so tired of holding myself together and everyday a new problem crashes into my being and shatters my bottled up emotions. I haven’t cried by myself in weeks and sometimes I daydream about the feeling of just finished crying. It still feels good, to just let it all out but not all of it *is* out. If it were, I think my entire apartment block would hear me sobbing and screaming. 
This evening I made the decision to stare at myself in the mirror and analyse my flaws (I’m quite sure I have body dysmorphic disorder) but I’ve had a loose tooth these past few days and I decided to yank it because it bothered me so much. There was no pain, I freeze. A bitter metallic taste floods my mouth, I’m bleeding. I’ve never bled so much from a tooth and it’s still clinging to a piece of my gums. I stifle my panic and start rinsing, slowing the bleeding with cotton balls. The bleeding eventually stops and I calmly enter my mother’s bedroom where we’re about to pray. I lie next to her and calmly tell her that I yanked my tooth and it started bleeding. She laughs and I freeze again. Then there’s that tired but enraged feeling. I tell her it’s not funny. She stops laughing but her smile remains as she recalls how she used to pull out her own teeth as a child in the Philippines because she rarely could go the dentist. I hate how she’s reacting. I also hate how *I’m* reacting too. My mind instantly goes “This is why I can never tell you what’s going on.” And this thought ricochets in my mind as she trails off from her story and she finally notices I really am upset. I’m crying and I didn’t notice. She has guilt tripped me again and she doesn’t even know. She will never know. She doesn’t have time to reflect on this moment because she’s so busy and already so stressed. This bit in short ends with me, still crying and forcing out a prayer of thanks and still thinking about how I never tell her what troubles me. 
My mother is already so stressed with getting better child support after the divorce because my selfish cheapskate of a ‘father’ still hasn’t landed a job in America, taking care of my other two siblings and my cousin who was recently diagnosed with cancer. To her, I was her ‘miracle baby’. To her, I am God’s greatest gift. To her, God made me and not her. To her, God is good. To her, I am the best and most responsible of my siblings. To her, I am her pride and joy.
I’m sorry mom, but I decline any of this to be true, not anymore. 
I have become so damaged, I’m only 15 and I feel like I’m just short of splitting my own head open with the sheer force of my stress. I have begun asking myself whether or not I can keep up. How long will it take until I can take no more when it’s a stupid impulse that sets me off? How much will this one moment affect me in the future? Is it worth being the good child my mother so desperately needs? 
The moment I left the bedroom and into my own bed I silently wept into a stuff toy. Silently telling myself “It’s going to be okay, it’s going to be okay, you’re going to be okay.” Again and again. I’m still crying at this point of writing. I don’t know what I can do. I just want to be okay, I want someone to understand. I don’t want to be the “good child” if it hurts so much to hold myself and everything else my mother can’t, up. But I have to. I need to. I wish I was stronger but to me, strength just means being able to pent myself up even more. 

I’m sorry if this is so poorly structured or posts like these aren’t supposed to be here, I just  really needed to hurl this away from my mind. Thank you."
112,I Don't Even Know Anymore..,"Very TL;DR Warning ahead.

I just want to start by saying thank you to those who have taken the time to bother reading this, and I apologize for my frequent digression and poor writing. I'm realizing now upon doing this how crazy it is to search for help on the internet, but in my experience Reddit has been a pretty awesome community.  I also apologize if there's something unclear about my writing. This post will be constantly on my tab so I will be as active as possible if there's something you think I should clear up.

Over the years I've put myself in such a colossal conundrum that often times I look to death as a viable alternative. I'm at a constant, internal war with myself. There's a side of me who wants to end my own life as to not further burden the world, but there's a side who wants to keep fighting. To be quite honest, I'm not even sure what sort of question I'm asking with this post. I just want help. 

Growing up, life wasn't exactly difficult. I have one older brother who I am very close with, I have the most compassionate, and caring mother anyone could ask for, and my dad is a hard worker. Since both my parents were first generation immigrants who had nothing from the start, they had to work their asses off for everything. We progressively became more and more affluent. My parents had to work shitty odd jobs while going to school, all the while taking care of me and my brother who appeared out of thin air. One night my mom comes home late from work, and my dad is crying (According to my mom this is the last time he's ever cried in over 20 years). He hated how she had to work everyday, which took time away from raising me and my brother. Apparently, there was a news story going around at the time about a babysitter getting caught abusing the children she was supposed to take care of. Thus he became paranoid, and couldn't trust a babysitter. He made a choice that night - told my mom to quit her job, and do whatever it took to raise me and my brother to be the right kids. Next thing I know we saw less of him. He got his PHD, and then got a vice president job at a materials firm. Money was getting better so we moved into a suburban area where my brother and I grew up. My mom dropped her entire career, taking care of us was like her full time job. Time goes on and my dad gets higher up the corporate ladder. We slowly realized we were starting to see less and less of him. Eventually he would leave the country more often - until two months away, and then two weeks back was routine. Me and my brother's lives went on, but our relationship with our dad became more, and more distant - and by that I mean bad. We went from looking forward to seeing him come back, to begin dreading it. There was no more reunion in the 2 weeks of his return. No more hugs and kisses - it was just yelling. He became quite verbally abusive towards us. Saying how we were spoiled, pathetic, and there was always something said about how we weren't good enough. He would often say that our mother didn't raise us correctly. Thing is - I know he just wanted us to be better, but I only know that in retrospect. He never laid a finger on us, but whenever there wasn't something to get mad about, he would find something. To this day, I still fucking dread the Christmas holidays. Every Christmas there was a line-crossing fight over something that started off miniscule. Often times it would tarnish our family's entire week.

A revisit to a fond memory of a dialogue between my brother and father while getting ready for a potluck on Christmas 2013:  
""Son, can you put this tray of lamb stew in the trunk?""  
""Yeah, should I put it on the cooler?""  
""Just put it somewhere that fits""  
""This looks like it might leak, do you want me to hold it?""  
""JUST DO WHAT I TOLD YOU, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO DISOBEDIENT EVERY TIME I ASK YOU TO DO ANYTHING, ARE YOU THAT USELESS YOU CAN'T DO SOMETHING SO SIMPLE? IS THAT WHY YOU...""  
\*hour long fight ensues\*

Aside from me being the sort of wicked child, I think both my brother and I did quite well in our upbringing (though he was always better). We had a lot of friends, got good grades, got well assimilated into western culture, and did well for ourselves. Sometimes we got a little too social (coming home at 3AM, gaming, etc) which in hindsight was the reason for a majority of the arguments between our dad (though for the most part, I was a good kid - no drugs, no alcohol). My brother went to university, graduated, then got a job at a company in our home city (He went off the rails a bit, and travelled the world, but that's irrelevant). Next up to bat was me. There's a long story about how my university acceptance process was delayed, but it led to me choosing an out of province university at the very last minute. Next thing I know I'm in a new city alone. Making friends was never a problem until then. I wasn't in campus residence since I was late to register, so I lived in a small house off campus. The school year went on and I had no friends. Gradually my grades start to slip, and I stop going to class altogether. I try to use my parents upbringing as motivation, but it didn't work. If anything, it made me feel worse. I felt undeserving of everything I had, then began slipping into a vicious cycle of self destructive behaviour. I would develop a gaming problem leading to me playing Minecraft for 9 hours a day. It was my escape. I remember seeing social media posts of my friends making new friends in their respective universities while having a blast and it fucking killed me on the inside. Next thing I know I fail the same course twice, thus putting me on academic probation - still no friends as well. I slowly slip into a lonely depression, I even lost motivation to make friends. I just sort of gave up. Second year, I tried to get out of academic probation. Didn't cut it. Third year I didn't get into any courses, so I made a decision to transfer into a college back at home to start afresh, then eventually transfer my into the university of my city. Thing is, parents didn't know I failed.

My mom was thrilled, since she was getting lonely by herself. Since I've always had a love for cooking, I took a year off and worked in a restaurant. I went back to school the following year, but was also still working part time. Grades weren't great but they were steadily getting better. Though I was still at a first year standing and was taking courses part time, my grades started to look up - 2.2 then 2.7 then 3.0. I found a volunteering gig teaching kids piano, then met a dude at school who would later introduce me to all of his friends. They began inviting me to hangout, and the next thing I know I made myself a solid group of friends from college. After 4 gruelling years of loneliness, I had finally felt belonging. For me, life was awesome. I loved my job at the restaurant, I was teaching piano, I was in school again, I had my high school friends, my college friends, and I was close to my mother. Frankly, I think this was the last time I remember being happy. 

My family begins to worry about me being in school for so long. So despite having a solid thing going on at the restaurant I worked at (my head chef liked me and wanted me to stay and be sous chef), I quit against his and my wishes out of solidarity to my parents. I also quit volunteering. My dad was upset about my schooling, and I was upset about quitting. We fought. I got berated for how useless of a son I was. Most of my friends were either graduating, getting steady jobs, getting promotions, being halfway across the globe, starting their masters, or having kids. Here I was still struggling just to get into second year. For the next hour, I was frozen as he stated all of my flaws, and how bad of a son I was, and I how I was a traitor to the family for costing the family money, and having nothing to show for it. I'm compared to all of the children of his colleagues, how they were better and why I couldn't be like them. It was a pretty bad night. I almost killed myself. 

Needless to say my mental health began declining again. I focused my time on school, and nothing else. Playing an instrument slowly lost its lustre, and cooking became.... just cooking, nothing else. I was reattempting the major that I once failed years ago. Strangely, I was doing really well in school despite this. I was able to achieve a 4.1 GPA that year. I decide to finally transfer into my local university to finish my degree, and tell my parents. They were happy, but I knew that I wasn't. Later, I realized that a misread led me to missing the application deadline for the university. Needless to say I was quite dispirited, so I didn't tell my parents. Regardless, I created a strategy. I would just take one more year doing electives at the college I was at (they didn't offer anymore courses in my major) and then work harder once I successfully transferred the next year. The next year follows, and when I thought things couldn't get worse - they do. I just sort of lost it. I couldn't focus anymore. I began getting crippling panic attacks. I couldn't get out of bed. I got very overweight. I started avoiding my friends like the plague. I stopped showing up to events. I hated myself. Self-doubt was previously manageable, but this time it became mind consuming. In secrecy, I spent the remainder of my savings from my former employment on a therapist. She was lovely, and understanding - she was the only person in the world that knew what I was going through. She helped me take medical withdraw from the semester altogether to help me recover, and I began taking antidepressants. The following semester comes and I decide to take it easy and take an online course at an online university. Because of my incompetence, I fail it. Well, that's okay because I still have my grades from last year right? As long as I don't tell the university that I took this online course I'll be fine right? Nope, this is the part where I find out that not disclosing any attendance at any university is academic misconduct. My previous grades were now tarnished. Upon days of self-reflection, I finally decide to be the bigger person, and be honest about my failure.  I reckoned the last thing I needed was to have an academic dishonesty prey on my consciousness. I figured this is would help me mature, and make me learn to own up to my mistakes. Did I end up applying at all anyway? Nope.

Well, there goes another whole year. Everyone in my life thinks that I'm back on track, whereas in reality I'm wasting even more time, and even more resources to basically amount to nothing. I've never been so off track in my whole life. I'm broke now. I haven't seen my therapist in several months (can't afford it anymore). I stopped getting re-prescriptions for meds. My depression/anxiety is resurfacing. I'm 24 now, and I've accomplished nothing. 

I finally applied to two universities in my city this year, and I'm taking the last 3 bullshit elective classes I will be able to take at my college in order to boost my GPA. I disclosed everything I've done in my applications, so the chance of getting rejected is quite high. In the midst of my average for university entrance, lies several Ws and a fat fucking F. I still doubt myself to this day. Should I have just lied?   
I just find it so fucking incredibly disheartening that I'm struggling with something almost everyone I know has done. By no means am I undermining people who haven't gone to college. The people I know who haven't gone to college have already gotten steady careers, gotten married, travelling the world, or living life in their own happiness. I keep getting in the way of myself, and one stupid mistake after another has led me down this infinitely deep hole that I'm hopelessly trying to get out of. Is there even a point in trying anymore? Should I just end it all and save everyone the trouble of my existence? I just don't know what to do if I don't get into either school. Have I spent the last 7 years doing fuck all? I feel so behind in life. I'm 6 years older than everyone in my class. I have old co workers who are chefs now. I don't even know if I know how to play piano anymore.  Because of this desperation to feel better, I stopped watching porn, masturbating, and gaming. Working out doesn't even help anymore because I can't take my mind off my life. There's no safe space for me anymore. I can't even go back to my therapist because I can't afford it. Everyday I get this crippling feeling of homesickness even when I'm at home in bed. I don't feel worthy of being in my family. I can't hug my mother and feel safe anymore because I feel nothing but guilt. There's nothing left for me to hold on to for safety."
113,Is it normal to freak out internally when your acquaintance bans you from their server and blocks you for a reason you dont know?,"Because I feel childish, but legit I'm having massive anxiety thinking abut it. Long story short: I was't the best in the past and people would tell others my personal business, saying they shouldn't contact me or whatever. I was literally in a bad spot mentally, that's not an excuse that's just facts. Needless to say I've been doing waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than before and haven't done that shit in awhile. It was moreso me being overbearing and stalkerish. 

The friend that unfriended me, banned me from both of his servers, knew my past and we were on good terms. I wuldn't call him my friend-friend, we barely talked but we would occasionally interact on Tiwtter and on his server. I wated to be more active on Discord and load-and-behold, he posts a server invite for ARG creators (not gonna be explaining what that is, look it up)

It was kinda cool, I guess? I dont know what I was gonna do there and would've probably been absent anyways. I'm not good at staying active in servers, unfortunately. 

Before the sudden cut-off, we were talking just fine and causal. Literally, **nothing was abnormal.** 

I was talking about Dyno-Bot because dyno-bot as in the server and he was testing it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think he banned me and unfriended me because people in the server saw me and lied to him. They probably brought up old drama and told him I'm so and so. All lies because I cant think of a single reason why he would considering I've done nothing apparently in months. I really dont know. I tired talking to him calmly in his main server since he blocked me, but he banned me from it. I was so confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, Im hella paranoid and scared. Yeah I know its silly to care abut shit like this so deeply, but I want to know my mistakes and try to fix them. Plus, I have a habit of forgetting things. I ill do things, say things, then forget I've done them. Its not all-the-time obviously, but still. 

I hate it when people talk behind my back. I hate it when I get people angry like this because its shameful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk.. I guess I have other shit going on mentally, i.e migraines/ Really this isnt helping, am I overthinking this or is it normal to be kinda upset when stuff like this happens? I'm not upset-upset, just... Worried and angry with myself."
114,Delusions? I feel like my life is going to play out like a ya fantasy novel.,"I keep telling myself that eventually if I find the right magical item or end up in the right place at the right time then my life will play out like a young adult fantasy novel. I have had this mindset for as long as I can imagine and while it’s normal for kids to believe that, 19 year olds typically grow out of that mindset. I don’t know if this is escapism, a delusion, or just having a childlike sense of wonder. The main problem is that I’m so stuck on the idea that it’ll happen that I wouldn’t know what to do if it didn’t."
115,Have you ever felt misdiagnosed?,"I think they are wrong with what they say is wrong with me they say it's just adhd, mild depression and moderate general anxiety. But my anxiety has been a lot worse to the point I don't want to leave my bed and I'm a crying mess about having to go to doctors or even work and I also know that there is no reason. But I have brought up that something isn't right and that I think something else is wrong that they aren't treating. Now I'm being told by my gi dr they think I have an eating disorder, but I'm scared my psychologist isn't gonna listen to me again.. I feel like I'm lost."
116,Does anyone else's mental health seem to sharply decline when at home?,"Outside I'm the happiest, go-luckiest guy you'll ever meet. I'm always happy to be outside and around other people; I have an extra-extroverted energy and I want to share it with everyone. You'd probably think I'd never felt anger in my life, however...

At home, it's like there's a giant sense of unease. I become insanely-irritable and anything can set it off: A stubbed toe; a spilled drink; a loss on a game; my mother in general. My mother's easily the worst trigger for my irritability, as almost every single thing she does just about sends me into rage. I could write a comprehensive book on the ways my mother annoys me, but that's for another post (if there's a sub for that please point me to it??).

Outside, a stubbed toe would be laughed off; a spilled drink would be calmly mopped; a loss on a game would be spilled milk. My mother would still be a point of irritation, but at least a tolerable one.

What's going on guys? The irritability isn't who I am. I want to be nicer to my mother, but I just can't conjure up anything other than sharpness as my most polite response to her presence."
117,So with yesterday being Valentine’s Day...,"So I’ve have anxiety disorder since forever , depression on and off since high school. But I broke up with my boyfriend ( yes I broke up with him) and i ended up getting depressed I know how pathetic😂, I had to get a therapist and everything because I simply just didn’t know how to just be alone , I forgot how to be my own person of that makes sense, but yeah yesterday was a little hard , we had been together for 3 years and (I’m 23) but it was my first real relationship so you know it’s just a little harder but I got through it , I stayed positive and today I woke up and guess what it’s a new day and I’m carrying on and I woke up positive . You really need to look at the positive things , and the progress you have made. I’m proud of me!"
118,Currently on 24 hours of no sleep wish me luck,I have to go to work in an hour. I couldn’t sleep last night. I’m hoping it won’t be too stressful. I have a hard time managing my emotions if I don’t get enough sleep so wish me luck
119,Any artists/people using their hands a lot (regardless of specific disorder) here who have like this internal shakiness that makes it very hard to draw focused lines? Motor skill related but you’re not shaky on the outside? Better explanation in description.,"I’d REALLY like to know if anyone else has this, regardless of the mental disorder and if you ever figured out why it happened.

Quickly about me: chronic major depression with anxiousness, family history of schizophrenia, chronic pain and a few other things because God hates me lol. This symptom always worsens when I’m medicated somehow.

What I’m trying to describe is basically, you know when you’ve had an argument with someone that was very emotionally upsetting and after it’s over you still feel like shaky on the inside? Your heart is going slightly faster but you can’t shake it off. Have you tried writing or drawing or just grabbing a glass from the cupboards like that? That’s the closest I can explain that feeling. It’s like - with the glass example, you see it, and you go to grab it but even as it’s in your hand you feel clumsy and almost drop it. But you’re not shaky to other people. But you feel the slight agitation inside? When you draw/write with that shakiness it feels kind of choppy, now flowy or smooth. It’s like your brain needs like a millisecond longer to catch up with what your hands are doing. It’s like very very tiny barely noticeable jerky movements you unintentionally make. It’s driving me crazy.

It’s also a little like drinking just a bit too much coffee/tea. Like let’s say you draw and want to draw a line and then you want to set your pen where that line ends and draw another line from there on, but it feels very hard to focus to put the tip of your pen right where the previous line ended and often you are just a little off the mark and it’s incredibly frustrating. 

Anyone at all with at least a kinda close feeling to this? Ever figure anything out about this? Any meds/foods that seem to worsen this?

Really would love to hear experiences like this, if you’re uncomfortable you can send me a pm too."
120,"Had a really happy and realistic dream, woke up deflated and sad.","I've been single for about 2 years now, came out of an extremely toxic relationship that left me isolated. I'm in a much better place now and am the person I want to be.

Last night I had a dream I was in a relationship, a balanced caring and fun relationship. It felt really realistic but obviously when I woke up I realised it was all a dream.

I understand the importance of not relying on a relationship to make you happy. But I do miss being in a relationship and having that 1 person who is your best friend and will always be there for you.

The anxiety is killing me. I haven't had the desire to eat at all since then. The most I've been able to eat is a sandwich with a couple slices of ham.

As an adult I still have both but with other issues as a well. I won't self-diagnose myself so I don't know what, besides that I *obviously* have bad health anxiety.

124,Beyond depression,"Have you ever tried expressing your feelings in words and

A) Realizing that words cant seem to fully express your emotions and a simpler ""I'm okay"" would just save you the hassle. 

B) Being told that it is ""gonna pass"" and that it is normal to feel such.

C) Being told that there are people who have it worst and that you are just making a mole hill out of nothing at all. 

Check, check, check 

It just seems that there is no-one out there to fully comprehend. 

I don't know, I wish I could just pen down my feelings, cry it out, go to bed and wake up feeling better but it just doesn't seem to work this way."

126,I can’t feel happiness,"i don’t know where else to post this i’m sorry 

my ex broke up with me about a week ago and everything has a been nothing but a mess. the reason he broke up with me is because of bad habits i had that affected him badly. this really hurt me as i had improved a lot n was still getting so much better. and some of the things he named i either didn’t do or didn’t know i did. 

anyway, he told me he still loved me, cried about it, thought about giving me another chance, etc. so i just put myself a goal that i want to be good enough to try to date back again. at some point i decided this was unhealthy as it wasn’t 100% this goal could be reached, even if he said he’d be open to it. but since then i lost all motivation.

i’m always nervous, that i have a reason to be or not, that’s what i feel. and when i spend time with my friends, i think the only thing it does is distract me from negative thoughts and stops me from crying since i’m uncomfortable crying in front of everyone but my ex, who was the first person i did feel comfortable with.

at first things were easier because i didn’t feel
alone with that feeling as he was going through it too. but now, it feels like he’s already moved on, living his best fucking life and i’m stuck here at the worse i’ve ever been.

i feel so alone and i do have friends and i know i am cared for but i know i’m a second choice to everyone i know. it felt different to be loved that way, ive never had anyone care about like that. such an amazing guy, i’m beyond lucky to have met him. 

but now i lost him and i’m so lost, i’m back to how i felt before but worse. i don’t wanna feel like this. i hate being so alone, ive lost patience with everyone, they kiss me off so easily. i just wish i could hug him n this could be all over.

i font know what to do. i’m sorry if this is hard to read, i’m crying a little right now:(

tl;dr : my ex broke up with me n he was the only thing who seemed to make me feel less alone n happy. i’m now constantly anxious n numb or crying."
127,16(M) in mental and physical health crisis,"
Thank you to whoever reads this. My story is so long and crazy I can't recall every event leading up to this. To boil it down I've been in a pretty bad health crisis for \~2 years now. I spent all of elementary school at a very small charter school with no more than 400 kids. I mention this because I have really bad social anxiety, and one of the things I suspect could be ruining my health. I played lots of sports, had lots of friends, and I had a gf(whatever that counts for). 

Fast forward to my freshman year of high school. I made the choice to pursue my love of football despite my fear of meeting new people and going to a public school with 2k kids. I knew some people before just jumping into it but to say the least I was pretty scared of most people but for the most part it wasn't that bad. Things begin to go downhill when football season starts. My graded start to slip in math pretty badly. It was a lot of pressure as I was pushed to far ahead into a math class I wasn't ready for. If you we ineligible to play, everyone on the team knew about it, and that combined with my extreme anxiety was a lot. I began having a lot of pain in my lower body. It got bad enough where I simply couldn't run. I started having to sit out of practices and face scrutiny from teammates about how ""I was faking"" and ""didn't wanna play."" This may not sound too bad to the normal person but the amount of fear inside of me at pretty much all times form this point on was pretty insane. I started thinking about every uncomfortable social interaction I would have to make the night before. This is when things really got bad.

Almost every aspect of my health took a hit. My digestion starting getting really bad, I had horrible fatigue, full body soreness, and horrible brain fog. I went to a multitude of doctors to which one could tell me there was something wrong with me. I was really suicidal but I've always been an extremely driven person so I took matters into my own hands(note that at this point my trust in modern medicine had been destroyed). At 15 years old I was tasked with sourcing the medical cause of my health decline by myself because my parents didn't take me seriously. Not only that but I had to balance my relationships with friends, my grades, and my parents desires at the same time. I had nobody to vent to. No 15 year old kid is going to understand and offer advice to such an intricate issue.

I became obsessed with natural health methods and did 100's of hours of research everyday after school. I completely changed my diet and started taking supplements. I eventually found a chiropractor for my pain issues and he referred me to a naturopathic doctor. I saw him for almost a year before leaving. He was a genuine guy who really cared but I din't feel like I was making enough progress. I decided to leave him about 5 months ago. I'm starting to be more open to modern medicine but I've had such bad experiences with every regular MD I've been to because I could tell they didn't really care. I want to see a psychologist to hopefully help me out and make my life a little less hellish. I've gotten myself into a spot where I don't think I could do any better for myself without some mental help. If anyone reading this could comment a similar experience for me to compare with it would really help feel like I'm not the only kid in the world who has to deal with such a severe issue. Thank you"
128,How to cope with memory loss due to severe long term anxiety,"Hey guys, hope everyone is ok. I’ve been suffering from severe anxiety for three years straight, and I’m starting to notice that my memory, both long term and short term, has gotten worse over time.

Does anyone know how to regain your memory back? Are there any ways to do so? Thanks for your time."

130,Living with Extreme Social Anxiety,"Hello, first time posting on here.

I'm a 29yr old Male, living in Scotland.

As far back as I can remember, I have had anxiety. About everything. A couple of years ago, I realized how not normal it was to be worried, and stressed literally all of the time - over every decision, every interaction. I had grown so used to it, I had just assumed I was normal. To this day, I don't leave the house unnecessarily, because something as simple as walking to the shop to buy food can be an incredibly stressful experience, with what seems like millions of possible situations flooding through my mind, until the task is done. I feel uncomfortable in my own house, when the very best of my friends come to visit. I can't relax when I'm around my family, because I'm constantly on edge (I am fortunate enough to have a really lovely family, doesn't matter.) I manage work by pretending I'm someone else, someone without anxiety, but I'm a mobile technician, so really I work alone 95% of the time anyway. 

There are currently 2 people in my life I can spend any amount of time physically around, that's my partner and step daughter. I was content in my shell, always doing the bare minimum to pass as socially acceptable, but I cannot force this on these two people who have become so important to me. I have never wanted to be outgoing, or extrovert in any way, but for the first time in my life, I want to be different, better - for myself and the girls. We have almost no money, and the NHS is pretty much a dead end for me when it comes to this stuff (I was misprescribed anti depressants a few years back and spent a lot of time chemically depressed and suicidal, which was by far not the case before the meds) besides the massive waiting lists and overworked staff. 

So I suppose what I'm asking is, how realistic is it to assume I can better myself rather than relying on therapy to solve this problem? Because my habits go well into my childhood, I'm not sure how I would be able to shake them. All I want is to be able to go outside, and not feel like somebody's punched me in the chest. It's truly exhausting, as I'm sure any of you with similar experience will attest to. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this, it's much appreciated.

Tldr; lifetime of extreme anxiety fixable by myself? Or is some form of external support required? 

Cheers, and have a good day."

132,Anyone else feeling so down lately? Apathy and probably dissociation,"I don't know what really happened but it's been a week or so and I feel like I'm on the verge of losing all of my senses. I'm 22, my health is majorly declining. I feel like I'm all alone and no one cares enough to help me. No one will recognize the hopeless look in your eyes or how depressed you are while you see that in others and always lift them up. Did I wear a mask, or was I really happy and ready to help others?

I'm taking some light SSRI and I've always felt depressed but it's never gotten so out of hand since I started them. Right now I can honestly say I don't feel like existing or looking forward to anything. I've lost interest in every single thing and don't see a reason to continue. I was filled with anger and sadness but now I feel like it's all just gray and I don't see a way out. I feel like I'm falling even deeper.

I still have a high-functioning depression and anxiety but it's started to show heavily on the outside as well. I can't force myself to go to work, uni or whatever. Me and my roommate struggle with money issues that weigh me down. I feel totally hopeless and like a disgusting human being. I don't have any strength and only feel like I'm falling apart and can't take anything any longer. I just feel like I'm waiting for the next bad news to crush me. I feel like I'm only pretending when I'm happy (but I'm not! deep inside I know I'm not). 

It's like a weird sensation in my chest and heart palpitations that never stop. I can't get myself together. I can't even rest without worrying. It's like life is a major labyrinth I can't figure out. It's like I'm slowly disappearing. 

How do I stop this?"
133,Not Invited to my sister's wedding...,"ok so in a nutshell my(31/f) younger half-sister (25) is getting married in a few months. I'm not invited. Did I do anything wrong? apparently not speaking to your racist family anymore bc of being in an interracial relationship is me doing something wrong. Funny thing is, I wasn't the one to cut off contact. I just simply stopped trying to reach out. My cousin (the only one from that side of the family who still speaks to me) asked if I had been invited. I was not. 


I used to babysit her. give her life advice. cut her hair and just be the coolest big sister I could be to the 3 younger half-siblings. now nobody talks to me cause my fiance is black and we've been together 7 years, engaged for two. I'm trying to stay cool but this shit is really depressing."
134,I just realised I am a chronic escapist,"Sorry for too much text but I'm kinda desperate lol....I've been suffering from anxiety since I was a kid and depression also installed into my life when I started puberty, but now, at 23yrs old, I just realised that escapism, the best coping mechanism I had up my sleeve to make myself feel calm and happy has ruined my social life and my current relationship. I noticed I have been running from everything in real life lately, I even avoid my boyfriend because you know... he's too real. We live together and he's always there to crack jokes, talk about how things were at work and so on. I know everyone uses escapism sometimes, even my bf is a little bit financially stressed so he overworks and watches tv too much when he's at home. Despite doing all that, he's still able to be nice and social when ppl are around. Me? I get angry when someone, let's say him, wants to drag me back to reality and make me spend time with him. I get angry because I keep wanting to be left alone and write, listen to music or drawing while daydreaming, stuck in my own fantasies. I've been having problems even when it comes to sex, I don't feel the need to do it since a long time ago, it depresses me. What can I do? I can't afford a therapist and I don't want to hurt the few people I have left that are close to me. At the same time I wish they would leave me alone but I know that's not okay, because excessive escapism can apparently ruin one's life, you turn into a chronic procrastinator too."
135,Do you ever feel like you're not mentally ill enough for help?,"I learnt early on that the only person looking out for me is me but that has often meant I'm too capable to get help. 

I struggled getting on disability when my mental health was at it's worst because I was still trying.  
And I see friends getting help with finding a place to live where they can get support and not have to worry about their lives crashing around them, but im too independent.  
I've never gotten therapy because I've always managed on my own.  
I have a hard time getting a doctors appointment because my meds are working.  
And most recently despite that I should get ""extra help"" when it comes to help with getting a job but I get told I'm too ""smart and driven"" and come back in a couple of months if you still haven't gotten a job. I laugh and hung up imagining my life as homeless while knowing they are right, I work too hard on getting a job so what's the problem here.

I don't even think it's the support I (don't) have around me or my history or my diagnoses not being bad enough. I think it's just me and my personality. My anger always pushing me to prove everyone wrong.

And one can say that those things are for people ""that actually need them"" and if I can get those things by myself I should not complain. But it's always been a struggle with no support because I'm well enough to manage without completely falling apart but I've struggled quite a bit. It sometimes feel like I've lived as two people, trying to keep everything together because I'm taking care of me and only I can make sure we have a home and food on the table.  
I'm ashamed to admit this weakness because I want to be strong and a success story but going forward has been hard when any help i ask for comes back to me being told you can do it good luck."
136,I Am Wrong... [Venting],"I think I'm a psychopath or something...

One could say I've had a lot of things happen in my life. A lot of trauma, maybe. But I don't feel too much because of it. The occasional freak out because I remember something but mostly I'm just...numb.

Always have been. Ever since I was a kid. Despite those things happening. Every emotion I feel is surface layer. And I can push them away easily.

Last night, my friend told me I'm the reason they wanted to kill themselves a week ago. Because I'm an asshole who doesn't have a filter. I say things without realizing that they're shitty to say. I think it's a fact, but it's not. It's just shitty. And I hate that I can't see what everyone else sees as mean.

Probably because I'm a fucking psychopath.

And in addition, I now feel nothing.

When they told me she wanted to kill themselves, I felt nothing, really. I didn't feel scared, or guilty, or anything. I felt numb, empty. Maybe *slightly* desperate. I told them that I'm not worth dying over. But that was it.

I felt nothing.

I'm an abusive narcissist, just like my dad. Maybe a sociopath like my brother. It runs in the family. My cousin was diagnosed with conduct disorder, and my family is extremely narcissistic and manipulative on my dad's side. It's in my genes to be insane...

I'm not a good person. And it hurts a little bit. But I'm mostly just numb and empty inside..."
137,Valentine’s day is better with pets 💕,I just wanted to share something random lol basically this past month I was having a tough time w my depression it felt like a rollercoaster ride of emotions. and then especially v-day around the corner just been feeling a lot of loneliness and emptiness emotions and sadness. but I came to visit family and got to cuddle with my cat all morning just petting her and chilling together watching Netflix and napping. Her name is Truffles and I love her so much she makes me realize I don’t need no man she gives me all the love I need. It really helps to spend time with her I begin to realize where I need to put my focus on those in my life who truly love me instead of worrying about what I don’t have. I got her like 2 years ago and I honestly don’t know how I got through times like these without her before. If you are struggling w mental health I really recommend having a pet if you’re able to. It helps you feel a little less lonely and w a good trusted companion you can talk to without being judged! hope everyone enjoys their weekend
138,"When people speak to me, it’s as if my brain interprets it as Simlish.","If I am engaging in a conversation with someone, and let’s say I’m playing on Xbox, or just even driving, or anything that causes me to not pay 100% attention to the other person, I can not understand ANYTHING they say. It’s as if their words are gibberish, and it’s extremely annoying. I don’t know what it could be, but I have a strong feeling that I have Adult ADHD (I have most symptoms), so maybe it’s that?

It’s so infuriating not being able to sustain a conversation if I am not looking directly at them. Any suggestions/help would be greatly appreciated :)"
139,Waking up with extreme paranoia.,"Hey I was just gonna ask if anyone else experiences this or knows how to help. So every morning when I wake up, I automatically get this intense feeling of someone is in the house and I need to hide. No matter how many times I lock the doors, cover the windows, keep the lights on I always get this feeling. Most of the time I just lock myself in my moms room with a weapon to ride it out. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Just ask in the comments if you need any specification."
140,How can I help someone w/ body dysmorphia and depression,"Hi r/mentalhealth \- I hope I'm posting this in the right community, but may try r/relationship_advice and r/BodyImage as well.

So I (F, 30) have been with my boyfriend (M, 34) for 6 months. I've struggled with depression in the past but never eating disorders or massive body image issues (outside of the norm). But I'm posting here for some advice on how I can help my boyfriend through a difficult time.

He exercises quite obsessively and has very low self esteem despite being in great shape - he is generally depressed and struggled with his weight when he was younger. He doesn't really have any desire to work on himself emotionally in terms of therapy or anything like that, despite my gentle suggestions that it might help, and the only thing that makes him feel better is running. However, recently he sustained an injury that means he cant do that for the next couple of months and this has come as a massive blow to his self esteem and mental health.

He gets so down on himself that he makes suicidal suggestions which are obviously very concerning. It's really upsetting because I love and care about him, but I don't know what I can say or do to help and he is pulling away from me more and more the worse he feels. Does anyone have experience either from going through something like this themselves or with a loved one, and can give me some advice on helpful things to say, do or suggest to him that might alleviate some of this pain while he goes through a period of not being able to do the one thing that makes him feel a little better about himself?

141,Getting dumber and low energy because of voices,"Ever since I got schizophrenia and started hearing ""voices"" 4 years ago I feel lot dumber and kinda ""tired"". These ""voices"";which are basicly same repetitive thoughts repeating over and over as an echo, have possessed my brain and my brain capacity. I feel like at least 30% of my brain is possessed by schizophrenia&amp;voices, slowing and draining energy and making my brain overally dumber.

 Anyone else with voices feels like this ?

Is there solution to break these voices, these repetitive thought circles somehow ? Or I should just try to accept them and endure it like so far ?"

143,Ketamine Therapy,"I’m exploring the idea of starting ketamine therapy. I’ve read research articles and it seems to have good results. Has anyone personal experience with ketamine treatment? I would love to hear about your experience. 

A little about me...I have been taking medications for anxiety and depression for 23 years. Currently I’m on several meds. It doesn’t seem to help much. I’m tired of increasing or adding more meds with minimal effect. I will continue talk therapy regardless of my treatment path."
144,Anyone else have a safe space?,I was just wondering if anyone else has a safe space they go to when things get too much or just having a hard time? For me this is my kitchen (sitting on the floor also feels 'safe' for some reason). It's always been the kitchen wherever I've lived (maybe because I would get away from my abusive ex by being in the kitchen?). Basically I'm sat on the floor with my back resting on the fridge wanting to cry but no tears will come. I feel a pounding in my chest and I want to self harm. Fml.

146,I hate Americans and want some advice on how to ease that hatred,"Disclaimer: I don't mean to stir up anything here; I genuinely feel this way.

I currently live in the United States. Every single day, I am filled with an undying hatred for Americans. I can't even see them as fellow human beings due to how much contempt I have for them. Rather, I see them as vermin that I take drastic measures to avoid. I've already ditched all my American friends and cut off contact with all my American family members based merely on their nationality. I don't like Americans and I don't want to talk to them.

However, I do not plan on seeing any therapist or psychiatrist as I do not see this as an issue on my end and I do not believe in psychiatry as a legitimate field of medicine. I don't even believe in the term ""mental health""; I see emotions as a social issue rather than a medical one.

Until I'm able to leave this country, does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this situation? Is there any way I can ease my emotions without involving therapy? This is not a fun way to live."

I was never diagnosed with anything except anxiety depression and possible Asperger’s. What the hell?? I can’t plan or organize worth shit, I don’t do well in high stress environments, I always forget what I’m saying even while talking.

Im painfully mediocre at everything, which, I get, is normal, I just wish I had the drive to see anything though, and finally be good at something so I could justify existing to myself. I've felt this way since highschool and I just want the feeling of worthlessness to stop. Any advice is appreciated."

150,Shout out to the ones that help us...,"Shout out to the ones that help us, the therapists, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists. You always know just what to say, how to say it, and when. Sometimes it’s like you know what we’re thinking before we even say it. Through AMS, your able to help us put our feelings and emotions into words such as, “It’s like when...,” or “Think of it as...,” or “It reminds me of...”

Being able to think on your feet, so spontaneously, probably comes natural to some, others it may take some practice. I can only imagine that you have a databank of AMS that when you hear a particular word, a certain file opens and you somehow make it relatable and put it in context for us. 

I think we clients/patients tend to think our stories and experiences are novel, never heard before. While this may be the case at times, for the most part I can only assume that we all tell basically the same story, just with different people and places. 

So, shout out to the ones that help us, the therapists, counselors, social workers, psychiatrists, who always know just what to say, how to say it, and when."
151,Narcissistic Crush? Feeling f*cking shitty...,"Heyho, I don't expect any answers here except if you want to say sth or have been in a similar situation. 

Since a few months I am totally in love with a girl from my class. She has a boyfriend which is why I wouldn't make a move but I want to be around her in case their relationship ends. We've met sometimes for studying. Whenever we've met for studying our meetups worked. When I asked her if she wanted to go to the cinema, she said yes (multiple times) but cancelled 4 times only 1 - 3 hours before. Last time we studied, we talked for almost 2 hours instead of studying and she said that she wants to repeat a meetup like that but without studying. Today I wanted to meet with her and asked her last week and a few days ago if it works for her. She said yes but now she had an appointment which took her so f\*ckin long that now I guess she doesn't want to meet anymore. As mentioned she has done this multiple times before and we talked about that. Things went fine for a couple of weeks but now it's like before.

When she is texting me it's mostly school related and when I text her there won't be an answer for about 30 m. - 4 hours or never. Sometimes she is online but doesn't read my messages or she reads it but doesn't respond. I understand that no one is on his/her phone 24/7 but it isn't too much to just write a short answer especially when it's for a meetup.

From talking to her and looking at her behaviour it seems like she may be some kind of a narcissist. She has a slight drift towards feeling superior concerning her intelligence and her hobbys. She always wears very expensive (at least expensive looking) stuff. And the most important point is... even though she told me that she likes me I can't really tell if that's the truth because she treats me the same way she treats some of my friends who she doesn't like. But she also treats her boyfriend this way... mainly her bf is just picking her up from school. Her messages to him are also pretty short. She doesn't tell me very much about him (mostly concerning school because he is at university and went through all of which we are currently going through). She is also lying about him to me... Last weekend she made a trip to another city and said she would go with one of her girl friends when I asked. But she went with her boyfriend which isn't a problem for me but I have a problem with other people lying to me about nonsense.

I made her a birthday present which as she said made her cry because it was so cute from me but after all of that I can't believe her anything and I am not sure if she even wants to just be friends.

The worst thing about this whole situation is that I kinda like girls who are a bit more interesting with the personality traits (I am diagnosed with NPD and BPD). She is in so many points just like me (hobbys, political opinion, interests, people we dislike and why we dislike them, etc.) but I don't know if I can deal with a partner who is also a narcissist (and even more than I am)..."
152,the curse of future planning and having hope.,"i think I'm driving myself insane at some point with my overthought-planning,
I am still 19 and i live in such a 3rd world country or in other words, ""sh*thole country"", where all hopes and dreams are crushed with time, due to low materials/money, tradition and mindless/dump people.

I've always hated this place and the fact that i am only surrounded by things that are basically forced on me, like im living in this place just because my family chose to (by making bad choices of course), and being surrounded by toxic people and relatives i hate just because this is tradition, and being expected to continue living in here and staying in a local college because my family is so protective, needy and miserable. 
I hate living in and being surrounded by things I didn't have a choice with. it makes me feel chained and controlled.

I dream of just leaving this place without ever looking back, not caring about relatives or even my own belongings. I simply want to run away from this environment, set everything on fire and start a new life. 
at some point, it's not just a dream anymore, I am already planning it all, I have plans to get the hell out. or at least make my life better with my own choices. my plans start within 2-3 years.

the only problem is, my planning is getting out of hand, I can't stop, i keep planning everything. 
just imagine wanting to fix a million things in your life. its still too early for my plans, and i might be even giving myself false hope and im never gonna achieve anything, i am aware of how hard or impossible it is going to be, 
yet I've literally already planned what things to buy, how to decorate my future house, where to live, how to do it, what adventures im gonna have, where im gonna work, how im going to make friends, and even more than that. oh I've planned in details. and i am still f* doing it. 

my problem is i never settle in for what i already have, i am always seeking better things, always believing that i deserve better than this misery. 
don't get me wrong, i am not greedy or unthankful, I've just always had the lowest of things and the worst experiences because my parents should've never gotten married, it's so toxic in here and it has ruined me. i only want to save myself and live my life. 

now am i capable of achieving those plans you ask? I am. certainly. 
the only thing i need is a little bit of freedom and a small opportunity, that's only to make it faster.
and what might be the obstacles, you ask? definitely my family and relatives. 

i know no one has a solution for my planning curse, it just feels so good to let all my frustration out. i wish my brain could just shut up for a moment. wish i never existed."

155,I'm sick of people who think that most people suffering from a mental illness are just making it up,"My stepdad told me ""majority of mental problems are just (can't remember the word he used but something along the lines of 'pshycoactivated') basically made up in our heads and all you have to do is to be strong and choose to not be ill...

I have been silently suffering from probably depression,  schizophrenia and maybe anxiety for years now with obvious sings and nearly everyone i know has dismissed my feelings and toughts, because i ""don't seem like the type of person be that way"" or ""everyone is suicidal sometimes"" or ""your just pathetic and weak minded"" ""i have it worse"" ""your making it up""....and much more.

My ex best friend and their sibling (who both have gone to psychiatric hospitals) laughed when i told them i wanted to see a psychiatrist/psychologist and my other best friend said ""I'm so tired of everyone (me and 2 of their friends) being suicidal"" a couple of days after she found out i was suicidal. I feel belittled and scared to talk about these things that i can't control and that seriously obstruct my life

Thankfully i have one friend that actually encouraged  me to get help, which i appreciate so much but i just feel like absolute shit when these ""friends"" or ""family members"" say these things, they are being ignorant and don't want to learn."
156,Anxiety attack from coffee?,"I am a 21yr old female, healthy, active, been drinking 16oz of iced lattes every day for 3yrs. Sometimes having more or less depending on the day. Never bothered me.

Since 2019 early in the year i started feeling like my heartbeat was irregular and i couldnt breathe right at night trying to sleep. Assumed it was coffee and anxiety. I am/was also an active person for 3 years going to the gym doing cardio 5-7 days a week MINIMUM. Suffered from eating disorder related issues (restriction, over exercising, agitation around family events from food, etc). Got to the point I had to knock it off last summer and start eating ENOUGH CALORIES. My disorder has left my life but I feel like the damages it caused have been significant. I was so sick I would restrict and binge once a week and not even lose weight. The entire time I would drink coffee, sometimes more coffee calories than actual food!

Since i’ve been better I don’t think my actual diet is “healthy” (lots of sugar, processed foods that I didn’t allow myself to eat for a while). I’m also a broke lazy college student not willing to cook healthy meals often, honestly. I’ve been focusing on letting myself eat what I want. I haven’t weighed myself for obvious reasons but when I got a physical for work, I weighed the same weight as last summer (120lbs and I am 5’4).

The past 6 months I have been restless, waking up gasping and laying in bed feeling a sense of impeding doom and anxiety that i’m dying if I fall asleep. I can barely drive. 4 months ago I was driving, everything was fine, I suddenly felt a rush to my head of warmth (maybe a hot flash? Idk my car wasn’t hot nor was it warm outside) and started feeling like I was gonna faint. Pulled over and ever since I feel anxiety attacks coming on every time i drive and I have to power through the feeling. I only go to the gym 3 times a week how due to my disorder causing me to go too often back in the day. Sometimes I go less. I don’t track it. I go just to be healthy for my heart and health. 

Now the anxiety attack has been happening even at work. I feel the “hot flash” and worry i’m gonna faint and fall. Get EVEN MORE anxious out of the fear of embarassment in front of my coworkers. I think it is worth mentioning 2 months ago i moved across the country with my boyfriend and started this job a month ago. I was thinking it was the stress from moving causing all of this. Now i think it has to be caffeine. Here is why.

Last night I has 265mg of a nitro cold brew. Earlier at 7-9am I had 118mg of dunkin coffee. I normally have 118mg-160mg of dunkin PER DAY. I had 383mg yesterday. I felt okay, finished the coffee at 7pm. I had it because I got it for free through my work. I had lunch at noon, oatmeal and breakfast was bacon and sugary cereal. Normally i eat dinner around 6 but we had valentines reservations and I wanted to wait for them, so I had some chips and the coffee before I needed to get ready. I started to get ready, showered, felt nauseous in the shower and got out. Started having the worst dizzyness of my life and couldn’t finish getting ready. I felt like i couldn’t walk, or i’d faint. I felt dizzy and disconnected from reality, and like I was dying. I felt like I was minutes away from calling an ambulance. My poor boyfriend had to take care of me and we had to cancel our reservations and he got me a healthy steak and veggie burrito with rice and a sprite at home. Didn’t make me feel better. I slept finally though after 4hrs each day last week of sleep.

So my guess is I need to cut out caffeine, get more sleep, eat HEALTHIER, and stop thinking i’m dying. I just want reassurance if this has happened to anyone else. Today I still feel dizzy/out of it. But I can walk and I don’t feel as anxious. I have a family event today to go to, too and I feel like I can’t even go I’m afraid of having an anxiety attack there and embarassing myself/others. 

Please be nice if you respond. I feel so alone and depressed because I feel out of control of my life and I still worry daily that I have cancer or am dying of some other disease."
157,diagnosing question,"so lately i’ve been struggling because i don’t know what i’m struggling with.... 

my question is, what are the multi diagnosis tests and how do i go about taking one? i’m not completely sure on what it’s actually called but when i was younger i got tested for ADHD and some other things, and also IQ. it was kind of like a whole run down. i want to take one again because i think they got it wrong the first time. and with my current psychiatrist, i really don’t like her. i told her i think it’s possible i have OCD and she seemed careless with it. she made me fill something out and said “yeah looks like you have it” and didn’t ask me any questions about it and left it. it’s not even on my list of diagnosis’s. i wasn’t going in there to just be diagnosed with OCD in 5 minutes, i want a more extensive look because who knows that might not be what’s going on. i just really don’t trust her judgement at this point and i’ve been thinking i may have some other diagnosis’s but i’m just not sure and really don’t want to self diagnose myself. i want to know for sure and target my struggle areas and get help for my specific needs. i live in the midwest of america and there’s not really great mental health resources. especially for my area.

sorry this was so long, i appreciate any help or advice!"

Im starting to get ill and im really struggling. i used to eat 3 meals a day now sometimes i dont eat 1 and at that point its just a pot noodle. I got the sheets to sign up to the doctors but i need to do them and hand them in... it just seems too much to walk to the doctors....

She’s not only suffering from depression but also from episodes in which she can’t read nor write (like she doesn’t understand the meaning of the word s).

165,Relationship Advice,"The subreddit for relationship advice seems like there is harsh people on there, and this page has been helpful for me in the past.

I am not sure whether I should breakup with my bf or if we are just going through a rough patch. Let me start by saying that when I get stressed, my automatic response is to be alone and I am regularly stressed with school. We live a bit far from each other (2 hours) and switch off driving to each other’s houses on the weekend. We have been together for a little over a year and for the past 2 months, the idea of breaking up has been in my head. We fell in love so fast and what we have is really special, we are incredibly compatible and he is so sweet. Nonetheless, we also have our issues in that I am too sensitive and he is short tempered (in that he gets annoyed over little things). We constantly think that when arguments arise that we each think the other is blaming us, and that’s exhausting. He has 5 classes remaining this semester so that he can transfer to a 4 yr university, but i feel like i am putting more work in than he is, and that makes me feel unappreciated. He doesn’t check his classes so I’ve began making schedules for him that he tries to follow but still doesn’t completely. He says he wants me to push him but when i nudge him to stop “taking breaks” to watch YouTube videos then I’m nagging him he says. I complete assignments for him sometimes and it’s just annoying that he says i stress him out still for literally reminding him so he doesn’t wait until the last minute when we decide that i have to do it so it’s over faster. (I have a degree already in the subject he’s studying). 
I feel as though i can’t break up with him though. It’s like we’ve planned our lives together and he would be an amazing husband who understands me and i still think would work hard to support a family. I feel like i would be ruining all these plans and opportunities for him by breaking up with him. Deep down i feel like i need to work through my issues and focus on school though but i don’t know if that is just me always going straight towards the exit when I’m stressed. I am dealing with issues with my mother and recovering from that abuse. He is supportive, not always understanding, but i know he cares and tries his hardest. I just truly don’t know if this is just a rough patch. I think we both want to move past it we talk about it and we know we can be amazing together. 

I can’t talk to this about him because he would go straight to me thinking i was ending it. I’m also worried about how he would handle such a thing and also if that’s what i really want if it happens. 

I’m sorry thats long and confusing probably. Thank you if you’ve made it this far."
166,How to ask parents to put me in therapy while avoiding to talk that they're part of the reason why,"I have lots of issues...but I'm also very smart. I can't just talk to parents at this point. Never did in my entire life. A recent argument with my father got me in a really bad mood...I'll also start university in a few days.  


I'm figuring I might as well try goddamn therapy and swallow my pride...might as well stop swallowing all my feelings. 

  
It's really tough. How do I ask for therapy while not just saying ''you're part of the problem'' and eventually blowing up? A lot of stuff is bad, but I have so many feelings that I can't talk without exploding. If i just end up talking, I'll end with saying I hate my father, end saying I want everything to disappear, etc etc. That won't help anyone.  


Please do reply. How do I do it? What mental gymnastics do I apply? I'm planning on saying ''I want to learn how to better express myself and how to interpret what I want to do in life''...could work, could not. I am still not talking to my father after the recent argument.  


It's really tough being so quiet and upset when other people do not even understand why. I'm sure my father just thinks I had a fit and now I'm not talking to him. It makes me even more hateful.   


And also, how do I commit after this? The constant questions about it, IF i do go through it. It's gonna be so goddamn annoying...god i really wish it would all just disappear..."

175,"[Vent] [Advice] I have an intense anxiety over break-ins, and it’s starting to affect my quality of life at home.","So this is very weird for me to talk about, I’ve only talked about this with my SO and I don’t think he really gets it (can’t expect him to). 

Here’s a little background. When I was 19, I was in a bedroom at my then-boyfriend’s house. His family was sketchy to say the least, and his brothers were known around town for drugs, making enemies, being general wannabe gangster idiots. 

Anyway. We were watching TV, home alone, when we heard his brother’s name being spoken through the bedroom door. Alarmed/confused, my ex bolted out of bed and swung open the door. This shady motherfucker, a total stranger mind you, was standing outside the door. He came into the house and had been peeking in every room to find the brother. 

Verbal spat ensued, my ex said he’d call the cops, get the fuck out of the house, etc. Guy wouldn’t leave, said brother owes him money, he’s going to find the brother. 
Coincidentally, brother shows up on his bike outside, manages to break up guy/my ex, guy eventually leaves. 

Meanwhile, sheltered naive me was shaking, and every attempt to call 911 resulted in me dropping my phone. I was also discouraged from calling because brother could also go to jail, he had drugs on him. I was 19 and in love with a person who wasn’t an absolute piece of shit like his brothers, so I hope you might understand that it wasn’t something I was going to just break up with the kid over. He couldn’t help the way his family was. Would’ve handled that entire thing differently now. 

Fast forward to a couple of days later. Get a call that sketchy dude announced a hit on my boyfriend for getting in his face. Apparently, that night, he had just got out of jail. Thankfully that’s the reason why he didn’t have a weapon on him. He had come straight to the house. 

Now apparently guy was back with two friends in masks. Thankfully, myself/ex were not home. They kicked in every door, ransacked the house, tied his brother to a chair, gagged him, beat the shit out of him, stole a safe, the PS3, the father’s stash of cash, WWII items brought home from his late grandpa and other significant family things. Now, he was coming after my boyfriend. 

So, knowing some gang bangers were after him, I supported my boyfriend while he slept in his truck and stayed out of the home, trying to stay out of town, couch hopping with friends, living in poverty. Mom/Dad were useless tweakers and he had zero family to go to. This lasted for four months before he found an apartment. 

So anywho, that was the first time. It was a big deal, I didn’t have enough maturity or life experience or resources to handle it better. 

Second break-in was at the new apartment. Bad area as that’s what he could afford. I was a college student living in a dorm of a strict, small, private university -  couldn’t have him live with me or support him more than paying for gas and stuff while he was working multiple jobs trying to get by. 

Stepped outside for a smoke, came back inside, his laptop had been STOLEN OFF HIS BED, right where I slept. The laptop had been on my pillow. They cut through the window screen, hopped down on the bed, stole it, and left. They had clearly been watching through the window which was much higher, pitch black outside and no lights, so who knows how long they were there. It really fucked me up. 

Third time was a year ago. Living with my current boyfriend at our old apartment. It’s not a great town, lots of transients, gangs and crime on the rise. You do hear about break-ins. My boyfriend was out at a friend’s house, I was on the couch with our two dogs watching TV. It was maybe 10pm. I heard someone coming up the steps, and then aggressively jiggle the locked door handle. AGGRESSIVELY, PERSISTENTLY. My dogs went nuts and ran to the front door. I figured oh, he’s home early, and sounds pissed to jiggle the door so quick. Wonder what’s up. The dogs were excited too. Then it got very quiet. I wasn’t paying a lot of attention, I figured he was getting keys out of his pocket. Dogs were still intently staring at the door. Nothing happened. I felt my heart sink. I slowly walked to the door. My dogs were very alarmed and acting strange at this point. I was shaking, and began texting and asking him if he had come home. Nope, still 25min away at his friend’s house. What felt like an eternity past before I swung open the door with a kitchen knife. No one there. Still shaking, I went and searched around outside. Not a soul in sight. 

I told the manager the next day and our neighbor. Nothing ever came of it. 

I was never personally harmed, so I feel ridiculous for being so paranoid, but let me tell you it’s getting worse. The other night we heard some jingling. Sounded like keys. We looked everywhere. All doors were locked. I had a panic attack. It could’ve been a fork falling off a plate in the sink for all I know, but I went into a panic. 

I’m home alone today and am so stressed. I’m watching my dogs like a hawk to see what they’re listening to, am terrified to be without them, and am surely hearing made up noises. I can’t sleep at night lately without wondering who’s outside. I really don’t know what to do."
176,The future of mental healt diagnosis soon?,"I hope they will soon find a way to diagnose mental health problems with a kind of chip or something more accurate than quizz to diagnose personality disorders and mental healt problems.

177,I feel so worthless,"My friend messages me saying ""guess who took her virginity"" after him and his girlfriend where out for valentine's day, i always struggled to get past valentine's day but after this i just dont know what to do whenever i think about im on the verge of a panic attack ive had 3 already one of which i passed out and woke up 8 hours later the only way i can deal with it is by smashing my hand against a concrete wall untill i cant move my fingers i just dont know what to do with myself anymore"
178,Anger and irritability with depression and anxiety.,"I dont know what it is today, but I'm just so annoyed with everybody and everything. I woke up annoyed, had a panic attack, and now everything just makes me so angry.  So much so that even people talking or making noise just pisses me off. I just feel so terrible today and I dont have a reason. Everything, especially noise, just feels like its grating on my brain. It made me more angry when I tried to talk about how I felt, and a family member just dismissed me and said ""well you're just always like that."" I know it's not that big of a deal. I dont know why it actually hurt when they said that, but it just made me feel like I'm this emotional burden that everyone has to deal with.  Why do I feel so angry today? Could this be a symptom of my anxiety and/or depression? I don't know what to do."
179,Dissociative personality disorder or imagination?,"I'm not really sure where to start with this, but I'm gonna go ahead and say that no, I've not been to any professionals. It's not an option for me at this time, unfortunately, but it doesn't hold back my curiosity.

For a couple of years now, I've found myself being able to switch between three different personalities or a just plain apathetic state, each of these all very different from each other. They come with their own separate interests, goals, and ways of approaching things. I honestly think that it's just my imagination creating different identities out of these personalities, but I can't stop and it makes me wonder if that's really it. Across these separate ""personalities"", I'd do things that the other ones would never dream of doing (violence, uncontrolled crying, raging, detachment, and self-harm are a few) Thoughts?

Hi to start things of i'm 16. 

I've had a lot of mental health problems in my life, i have been clinically diagnosed with serve depression and PTSD; i don't really know how to start this off but i guess i will just start with my childhood. 

Right so i was born into a very broken family, Both of parents were heavy drug and alcohol users even when pregnant with me, My dad was increasingly abusive to my mother and myself when i was born, He use to beat my mother when she was still pregnant with me but when i was born the abuse was thrown onto me. I was hit and staved at a very young age. This abuse never really stopped until i moved out of my mums house on July 1st 2019. That date will  always stick to me because now i with a lovely family. Anyway. Fast forward 4-5 years, Me and my younger brother lets call him jack. I was i think 5 or 6 around the time and jack was 4 or 5 i don't remember this period very well but hey-o.  I was always a very aggressive kid when i was younger. i remember always enjoying watching other kids cry when i hit them or made them upset. I think its good to add i was bullied very heavily in years 0-2 (I don't know what grade that is in the UK) this was mostly i assume to my parents and i was given the nickname ashtray. I'm sorry if this story is a little all over the place my brain is just writing what comes to it. During years 2-4 my parents went through a divorce which ruined me. I think this kick started my mental health more then the abuse but i don't know. Anyway i went to live with my dad with my younger brother jack. This was a very poor decision from me because the abuse just got worse from there. My father spent all his money on Alcohol and possibly drugs but i don't know that for certain and would come home very late at night either drunk or angry. I saw very little of my dad in all honestly because i spent most of my time feeding and dressing my brother as i had to steal to get food. My most vivid memory of doing this was when i stole a £50 note out of my dad's wallet and me and brother went to the local shop and brought tons of toys and food for me and him. At the time my father was passed out in his bed from drinking from the previous night. When he awoke he was not a happy man and destroyed all the toys we brought. Beat us and kicked us out of our flat and we have to stay at our grandparents for a while. During all this i had to go to school and this where (me as of writing this and not then)  i start to know some usual behaviours and i regularly enjoyed hurting and stealing from other pupils and would run away from teachers and just be a massive pain there backsides. This meant i was excluded from many schools. I found it hard to make friends because of all this my dad forced me to go live with my mum with my youngest brother and my youngest sister at the time (lets call them Dave and Lucy) the situation here wasn't much better. My mother was a lot more physically abusive as she regularly kicked, punched and choked me. She always used to tell me stories of how abusive my dad was and i know he was but she was saying he raped her and almost killed her and all that and how he is the worse person to ever live. Now i can't say this events never happened but from what I've told and my own judgement i find this very unlikely that he ever did that but he was very physically and mentally abusive to my mother. So i do not know if she was trying to gaslight me or anything like that i don't know enough information and i don't really want to go around asking anyway. Anyway my mum always went clubbing and having parties at her house pretty much every weekend so on many occasions i would see or hear her with new men. (I never seen her in the act but i would meet the man and/or hear them during it as well. Walls are very thin in council houses) Talking about sex. I was and still am, An incredibly sexual person. I've always been very sexual  and flirty to Women and  this has led me to be disloyal to my now ex-girlfriend but i will get to that later.

Anyway i have strong memories when was around 9/10 going to omegle and showing my cock and all that jazz for people on there now i can't remember if this was with pedos or people like that, This is about 7 or 6 years ago but i do remember doing stuff like that online. I would say i was also sexually abused online if that's a thing where on KIK many overage men would make me send nudes or send me nudes for there pleasure now i can't remember if i did send any nudes but i do remember receiving them and having very sexual talks. I haven't noticed this changing me or affecting me in anyway but i thought i might just add that in. Also i used to abuse animals by mistreating them and hitting and hurting them. But i don't remember killing them or anything like that.

Anyway when i entered Year 4 i was very very abusive to peers. My go to method of causing pain was i would rugby tackle someone to the floor and grab there ankle and proceed to twist in it. In a manor if i was any stronger as a child or anything like that i would break it. I remember sending a lot of students to hospital because of this. That's really the end of my abuse to others for a while in my life until i turn 13

Now i'm 13 the abuse from my mother still continues, At this point i stopped contract with my dad and that side of the family. My life from the outside showed i was a normal kid. I had friends. I never hurt anyone and my grades were looking very very good. I've always been a very smart kid. I still haven't sat my GCSE's whilst writing this but i am predicted pretty much all A's (6's and 7's for the new grading system they have now in England) Anyway October 29th 2017. I start a relationship with the only person who've i genuinely loved. I'll call her Amy for the story. She was perfect. A legit 10/10 for looks. Personality and  just everything about her. She was my first everything. My first ever proper girlfriend, My first proper kiss, My first partner in bed. We did everything together. We were perfect. Despite this many people would be happy with this. But i always wanted more, This led to me. Cheating several times on her with other women. My first was 6 months into the relationship, In march of 2018. I don't know if she even knows this event took place but hey. This basically started me off and i couldn't stop until august of 2019. I loved seeing her hurt. I love having her no matter what i did and i knew that. She was incredibly dependent on me, I knew this and used to my advantage for sexual pleasure and for money (When i say sexual pleasure, I mean cheating and like sex. I have never raped her or anything like. I always have been and will be, Respect of people's bodies. I think rape is the worse thing someone can do. And they should be killed among side pedo and all those type. It's probably the only thing i feel genuine about being sorry  when i hear people go through stuff like that) I enjoyed seeing her cry and beg for me to come back when i broke up with her. I want to make this point clear. I never wanted to do this to her. I love her so much. She has helped me so much and i'm so so happy shes in a lovely and caring relationship now. 

Anyway i took the fact that she was dependent on me and  manipulated in many ways. I've always been good and finding the weak minded and using them for my own gain by gaining their trust and using them and then leaving them. It's why i was so good at getting female attention in Hospitals but we will get on to that later.  Yes we properly aren't even half way through .

Right I've been writing this for a long time now and i want to play mine craft so lets just gloss over the girlfriend because there's a lot but most of it is the same thing so lets just say i was very abuse and manipulative towards her and enjoyed doing.

Now we have the girlfriend period over during my 13-Present stage of my life. I think it time to talk about my suicide attempts. When i was 14 around October of 2018 i ran away from home after a dispute with my mum leading her to choke me up against a wall and punch me multiple times, I sat by a tree barely clothed basically ruined. I was crying and screaming and having multiple panic attacks over fears of me ending my life. This was also the period of which i started to self harm a lot.  I was then taken by police of which they took me to my grandparents house to rest in a neutral environment. I confine to self harm and my first major event was March of 2019. Where after a argument with Amy saw me jumping in front of a speeding car. I wasn't that injured and manged to get up and run away from the scene i then went missing for several hours as i tried to find money to flee to a different town. I was then found by someone who took me to the police and i was put under the mental health act. I can't remember which one it was but it's the one that only lasted 24 hours and i was taken to a hospital where i was watched and stayed there for one day. I think it might be good i hear voices in my head, Ones a very low pitch kinda growling type noise, And ones a high pitch kinda screaming noise. I haven't given them names as i tend to try and distance my self from them. Anyway after the that event my voices got a lot worse and my self harm got worse. This led me to be admitted to hospital due to my self harm where i remember at night time i could see a dark figure in the corner of my room, talking to me but i couldn't make out what it was saying to me. This led to me  hysterically crying for hours with nurses as i was too afraid to enter my hospital ward (aka where i slept). I don't know what this event meant to me and I've only seen things like that once and only then.

After this event. I slowed down on self harming. I still did it but not to badly. This led me to more extreme ways of self harm where it takes me to my 2nd major event in May or June of 2019  of which i took a pill overdose with about 60-70 pills of fluoxetine, Diazepam  and paracetamol. This led to me going to into hospital, I don't remember if i had to get my stomached pumped. I don't  think i did, But i do remember for the next 2 or 3 days being absolutely out of this world. I was higher then a kite for so long. I was off my head. I don't think it a good idea to recreate that for a legal high.

After this event Camhs (Child and adolescence mental health service; I was known to camhs for about 4 months at this point) thought it would be a good idea to put me into a mental health unit, Otherwise known as a GPU, inpatient Ward, Mental health ward. A lot of names. Basically it's just where they keep children who can't be allowed into the public over fear of hurting others or themselves. It's not as bad as it sounds. I quite enjoyed there. I was in the ward for about 3 weeks until i discharged myself because i was an informal patient and on July 1st i was released and went to move into my grandparents where i still live. 

Only after about a month of living here, One night in September of 2019 i climbed out of my bedroom window and this leads me into my 3rd and last major event so far. Where i climbed a 25ft bridge and proceeded to jump off. I am very lucky to not be dead or paralysed. I was bed bound for about 3 days as my back just wouldn't allow me to move. I was in hospital after this event for about 2 weeks. Once this happened my Camhs team thought it might be a good idea to look at some anti depression tablets, And i was in hospital for 2 weeks to test my medication in  a safe environment, My medication at the time was 20mg of Fluoxetine which has now been increased to 40mg. After my medication wasn't helping and my risk to myself and others were rising. I was admitted to another inpatient Ward of which i went under a intense 6 week course of DBT. ( Dialectical behaviour therapy ). I was admitted around the middle of November i believe the 16th or 15th around then and stayed there until recently where i was released on January 16th 2020. It was sad to spend my 16th birthday in a mental hospital.

In my therapy i often spoke about my love for violence  as i have day dreams and dreams of killing people. Especially  this one person who i won't name. We spoke about a lot of stuff that I've already spoke about in this post. 

But after being released from hospital. My self harm has basically stopped and i don't see my self doing anymore attempts to end my life anytime soon but i do have these periods where i will zone out for an hour or 2 and have like an outer body trip. But in real life i will right these cryptic messages and draw these disturbing pictures. I haven't told any of my professionals about this part. and in my own eyes i believe it has something to do with the shadowy figure i saw in hospital.

I guess really that's it. I don't know what i'm looking out of this but what do you guys think i don't know. Plus it's nice to get everything of my chest. 

I will keep you updated in future events. and if you having any questions i will answer then down below.

To end this on a good note. I seem to be changing my life around and making right of all the wrongs i did and Amy is in a loving relationship where she is cared for.

182,"Is it depression, laziness, or something else?","On my weekends I'm a useless lump. 

I don't want to leave the house. 
I sleep. Masturbate. Eat bad food. 
I remain generally bummed out and tired all day doing nothing. It's just always on the weekends. 

My boyfriend works weekends. 
I know I should be getting groceries or cooking or cleaning or reading or working on one of my 100 projects, but I'm not. I'm on my phone, masturbating, or sleeping. 

What the heck is this?"
183,Not sure,"Sorry for intuitive you,I am not sure if this fits here but....how do u deal with the feeling you aren't worth something,like I have friends who I think they're too cool to talk to me so I disappear on them for sometime then I return feel I am not worth their time and they're better than me ,is there something I can do for this to stop or am I in the place ,anyway sorry for the interruption"
184,Any non prescription meds I can get to help with depression?,Title
185,Please stop saying that depression doesn’t have a root cause,I have been diagnosed with clinical depression/anxiety and it was caused by my upbringing. I personally somebody who has been diagnosed with a wide range of mental disorders (including depression) and it was caused by the fact that she was molested by her stepdad and had a baby at fricken middle school. Her baby is now 6 years old and she still suffers. Life events sometimes trigger clinical depression and that’s a fact.
186,"what if I feel so bleeding awful ,but I can't tell exactly what I feel? My head is empty. I can't describe feelings:(",
187,talking to my family makes me wanna cry and i have no clue why,"for the past couple of months (no clue exactly how long) ive completley avoided my family (mainly my stepdad) simply because i cannot stand his voice. i cant stand talking to my mom when shes around him, but when shes not i enjoy her voice. i have no issues with either of them, i just keep isolating myself for no other reason than the fact that i hate hearing their voices.... even hearing their voices through a wall makes me wanna cry.
anyone have any clue what the issue might be? i thought it might be misophonia, as i experience that sometimes too, but this feeling is different. its not exactly rage, i just feel like crying. the only reason i can see it being is that i have issues with loud male voices due to past issues, but it just doesnt really make sense to me.
have a lovely day"
188,What would your 'dream' inpatient psych ward look like if you could be in charge of everything?,"I have seen posts/comments from people stating they were at a inpatient psych ward, and the staff treated them like crap (were mean, or condescending, etc), it was like a prison, over all a horrible experience, stupid rules, strip search, no phones, etc. 

So I was wondering, if you were in charge, and could create a wonderful psych ward, what would it look like?  What kind of staff would you have, what would they do, what would they say, how would they act, etc?  What kind of rules would you have for the patients and staff, if any?  What kind of routine for the patients would you set up, if any (ex: get up at certain time, meal time, activity, participation, computers/phones, bed time?)?  What would the actual ward look like (rooms, activities available, tv room, etc)?  How would the process work (would you have 1:1 therapy, and/or groups, would you have certain activities available, visitors, computers/phones, etc)?  What would the admission procedure look like (Ex: would the patient be searched, vital signs, street clothing versus hospital clothing, would you allow patients to ""be committed"" against their wishes, different wards for different diagnoses or same ward for all?)?.  Any criteria for discharge (ex: can they all leave whenever they want, with or without outpatient services in place?)  Any other details that you can think of.  

Would love to hear your ideas about how you think an inpatient psych ward should be run, and how it would all work effectively, what could be done to make it a good experience for ALL kinds of patients, and have the patient be ready for discharge in a healthier state than before they arrived."
189,Potential undiagnosed adult ADHD? (23F),"I’m a 23F, and I know that growing into adulthood in your early 20s is already hard enough. However, I’m noticing aspects about myself that are starting to destruct my life in a way I can no longer avoid. I think I may have ADHD. 

My room is in constant chaos. It has been since I was a kid. It’s hard for me to keep up with basic tasks like laundry and room upkeep. I’m late to work nearly every day because I misplace or can’t remember where I’ve placed certain things (car keys, wallet, phone charger, etc.) and spend a considerable amount of time searching right before I walk out of the door. The other day I locked my own car keys in the trunk. 

Within the past year I’ve had to replace the contents of my wallet twice, replace my debit card 3 times and my phone once. I’ve started to avoid going out drinking with friends because I’m afraid of losing anything important I bring with me. I also have a huge issue with making payments on time. 

It may just sound like I’m lazy and scatterbrained but I’m really starting to worry that I’m either losing my mind or something is extremely wrong with me. I’ve become so anxious and self conscious because I’m worried that people are starting to realize my absent mindedness and think I’m stupid. Any constructive advice is appreciated."
190,Therapy,What would happen if you went to Therepy and not say anything at all?? How many visits would the therapist let this go on?
191,Cant stop hitting myself,"So everyday no matter if i am in class or at home I have these moments where my legs start fidgeting, I get really hot and I just feel super uncomfortable. Like I have so much energy in me and I dont now that to do with it. I start getting like some kind of ticks and cant sit still. Like my legs start shaking and my whole body cant stop moving. I usually start hitting my forehead with my knuckles or slap the back of my head or other parts of my body. It has gotten to the point where my forehead is starting to really hurt and swell up. Does anyone know how this can stop?"

My depression crept in and made it impossible for me to learn. I cant remember shit. I'm too fucking stupid to go to school. I failed all 6 of my classes my first semester and they were easy. I basically flushed a couple thousand dollars down the drain just from school. I got into therapy, but I cant make any progress. Every single session I have panic attacks that are so long I spend the entire session trying to calm down. So I stopped going, because I just cant afford it.  If I just want to escape my problems, I cant, I have panic attacks everytime i leave the house.  I'm fucking hopless. My own brain is going to fucking kill me."

196,What about not having much interest in anything?,"I struggle with genuinely wanting something from life besides making my family happy. Most people I know seem to want something from life. A nice apartment, a nice car, a nice relationship, fame and money. Nothing triggers any emotional response. Most people I know, even if depressed or ill, want something (besides getting better).

201,Should I tell HR that I'm struggling and need help?,
202,I am done,"I am done being me. 

I don't want to be me. All the things i want to be or do seem to have layer upon layers of prerequisites i need to achieve before i can reach anything. 

I hate the way i deal with stuff. When i try to flirt the slightest sign that i might have messed up shuts me down completely. I keep procratinating on everything. I try to educate myself on these and other things but shit doesn't seem to stick. 

I cannot deal with emotions well. I get frustrated, angry, jealous, to such extents that it ruins my entire day, sometimes even week. Replaying mistakes without being able to learn lessons from them. 

I'm stuck in place, lagging years behind my peers. I am afraid to take risks, always assuming the worst. 

I'm lazy, unable to get myself to do the things i want to. 

I'm done, when does it end..."
203,I just want to feel lovable.,"I want to feel like I deserve to be loved. I can’t see it. I feel absolutely worthless,almost like if I died, it wouldn’t effect anything. I’m a failure, a worthless, good for nothing failure. I’m sorry, everyone deserves better than me. I’m so sorry."
204,Venting/Question,I was diagnosed with sketsofrenia when I was six-teen and I ended droping out of Highschool because of the stress and fear I let it beat me down for a while and it still has a hold on me but as I learned how to slowly address the problems that came with it I learned its something I can stand agens't my doctor urged me to write a journal and as I got older I started to regain control of my life I have recently accepted that this is part of me and isn't going away (Is it fine if I post my journal on the page if I felt comfortable enough)
205,My mental health gets worse when i’m alone,"I think my depression and anxiety worsens when i’m not having intimate relations. Problem is people usually go I need to sort myself out but I tried sorting this issue. I had 5 years of no intimacy at all. 

I think that is a lie people tell me? My mental health usually pushes people away so that I end up in square one again.

What can I do to sort this? I don’t want to die alone."
206,Idk if I actually have a mental health issue or I’m just terrible at dealing with change,"I have always kind of struggled with my mental health, even when I was a child. I had an anxiety disorder as a child/teenager that I eventually got help for after letting it limit me and my life for almost all of my life up until about age 18. 

I’m 20 now and I’m in college. I’ve gotten over the social anxiety I had-I rarely get anxious anymore. But now I find that I’m struggling with what I assume is depression. And it’s worse to me than the anxiety disorder ever was. 

I have gone through a lot of changes in the last eight-ish months-moving to college, joining a sorority, making new friends, getting into my first relationship, having sex for the first time, going through my first breakup, having my friend group dynamic change. 

I feel like my brain is really bad at dealing with change, especially negative, and it’s sent me down a depressive spiral. Now if i’m constantly busy with classes/friends etc. I’m worried about people not liking me, I have lack of appetite, I just want to sleep all the time, I feel lethargic and lack of energy, my thoughts are depressing. 

If I stay occupied 100% of the time I don’t feel that way, but the second I have a day where I have nothing planned I spiral."
207,Just for public record,"I have PTSD and schizoaffective according to a doctor and a psychologist. With that said a year earlier I was a healthy contributing member of society very grounded, could handle stress easier than others in my circle, etc. The entire point of psychological torture/warfare is to make the target look and feel crazy. So instead of your default position being ""take your meds"" when you encounter someone with an uncomfortable opinion understand you are unwittingly contributing to their mental deterioration. When you do this to a big enough group of people you are going to see disastrous life long results that may impact you as well. Telling someone to take their meds because you don't agree with them doesn't make you the adult in the room."
208,Just a reminder.,"You're alone, but that's alright. You're good company."
209,In a bad place. Feeling quite depressed.,"Right now I don't think either my physical or mental heapgh is very good. I know I'm having problems with my thyroid as I've had at least two blood tests done with both being quite modestly out of range. I haven't recieved treatment yet. I also think I may be at risk of diabetes. I used to be 20st (Now I'm 16.5st) but I often find my hands and feet become painfully cold even indoors. I also get so dehydrated and I'm constantly thirsty. I am so tired on trying to sort it all. I'm quite convinced it may possibly take my life at some point but I've tried to get help. Services are just so hard to access now (I live in England. So the NHS). I also moved to a halfway house to support my mental health. But yesterday I was upset. There is a rule that service users can't come into the other building where everyone sits until 10am. So I waited from 8am when I got up, in the rain and cold (I'm sure by now everyone in England has heard of storm Dennis?). So I'm sat in the midst of storm Dennis until near 10am. I open the door to the lounge and am told to wait outside. I checked my phone and it was 09:58. I had literally two minutes. I as told to wait them two minutes outside. I exclaimed how it was raining as she could see and to please let me off with the two minutes due to the weather. The order was non-negotiable and was told to either go to my room (which I did - but it was 10:05 on the dot when I entered so it was a poor suggestion) or wait outside. It felt so pedantic and disrespectful to make me wait in the rain, alone over two minutes.

See, also. I took another staff member aside to recieve emotional suppprt and to express how I felt. I filed a formal complaint. And ultimately I was hit with the decision of being banned from the other house for the day. I have spent all of today alone and isolated which may have ultimately caused my current mood. But it seems counter intuitive to the goal of the organisation.

thanks everyone"
210,Fear of change and how to get over it,"At the beginning of 2018 when I was 15 I was diagnosed with childhood onset schizophrenia. 

I had been working with mental health professionals since I was 11 and I've been experiencing symptoms as far as I can remember.

So far the only mental health professional I worked with that actually helped me had to move.

I've tried multiple different therapists since then and op but tbh it wasn't a very organized place.

I feel stuck in a cycle of having to force myself to trust someone I don't. Explain in detail essentially the most personal aspects of my existence (I am aware that is their job but after seeing more than a few that don't help it just feels like I'm telling strangers my life story)  and just hope that they'll help. 

Another part to this that is probably the most frustrating part is the med part. I first went on meds before I had the correct diagnosis.  I was young and I know that that doesn't really matter. But the np was super irresponsible with the way she medicated me and it sorta fucked me up more than it did help. I've been med free for about 2 years and It's one of the hardest things to overcome the fear that I'll lose myself again. That I'll have to lose  my creativity and the the things that make me happy and make me me in order to stay just flat lined. I understand meds help certain people and I am not saying they can't help me. It's just been a hassle trying to get over the what if's and the thought of another trial and error process. this entire life I live is a waiting game to wait some more. and it feels so mediocre like I can't complain I have a good life I had an amazing childhood my parents loved me. It was genetics. The very fact that I was born is the reason I deal with what I deal with and I can't help but feel like that was random chaos kicking me in the ass and now I just have to deal with it. pick up the pieces to a mess I never wanted. anyways I need to change to find a way to make my life worth it for me or in other words fulfilling. I am painfully self aware I am aware it is me that is preventing these changes. and I feel like I have no one to help me address these issues. I don't know if it's where I live and nobody knows how to deal with these sorta issues even the professionals or maybe it's just me again. I don't know the whole thing is super whack and I feel lost and so incredibly isolated. I apologize for the spelling mistakes."
211,I'm scared to go to a psychiatrist,"I've been going to a new therapist for a few months now and it's going pretty good so far. I feel comfortable talking to her, she helped me realize I have OCD. When I had an ""episode"" (I guess?) last year, she gave me the number of a psychiatrist and told me that I should consider being evaluated and being medicated. 
I wanna do it, but I'm scared.
Im 19 and, while I'm an adult, my mom wants to know what's up with me and she doesnt want me to take medication. It makes me doubt myself, because I am a high functioning mentally Ill person and, yeah being inside my head sucks but I dont know if my situation is bad enough for meds. I feel like they could mess up my head even more. Make me a zombie or something, if that makes sense. 
I'm also scared of what my family will say. I would be going to a psychiatrist for more than one diagnosis. I feel like they wont believe me or they will think I'm crazy or exaggerating. 
I know the answer to all this is to just go and do it, but I guess I'm venting. I'm so insecure and I'm kind of scared"
212,Idk where else to turn,"My wife and I have had one of our bigger (of many) fights, and I really truly believe that it’s over. There’s a lot of details that would take entirely too long to type out, but we are 9.5 years apart (me 30, her 21). We were together for 7 mo the before we got married. September was our 3rd anniversary. We’ve had a lot of ups, but just as many (if not more) downs. Usually it’s always verbal. Very hurtful things said. Often we’ve both gotten physical (yes, physical). This most recent fight started entirely with her (destroying some of my hobby pieces because she “doesn’t like them”). Yes alcohol was involved. But upon fighting over it, I have now made this fight (like all of the others) all MY fault because of my ensuing actions. She hasn’t been in love with me for a while, only still around cause “maybe” it would get better, etc. I don’t know what to do or feel. I’m a 30yr old drinker who suffers ptsd, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I can’t keep a “real” job (I have an LLC and derail boats when I can) which is another issue we’ve fought about. I get 80% disability from the VA, have no friends or family in the area, and a mountain of debt. Idk where to go from here. I just feel like my life is completely over."

So, whenever I were alone I feel like  nothing is  going good in my life , well it's not my grades are bad and in next few month I am graduating from college bbut I haven't learnt a thing I three years , and  in last few months I felling low have anxiety ,bad dream way too many thoughts of how I can pursue my future , and one more thing because of my shyness I haven't  made one friend at college ,I don't know what is happening to me and or will happen to me in future , I just passed my whole day stuck in the room watching endless tv shows worrying about my future and not doing anything to make it better because I never got the confidence  of doing it😭😭😭😭😭"
214,Need advice on anxiety and self-confidence issues,"I (21, F) have the habit of putting people's needs above mine. I do this especially with my boyfriend (who does not ask me to do it) and about tiny unimportant things. The problem is, I would act badly because I am lying to myself concerning what I really want. It means I would say something and then say I did not mean it, because I don't feel comfortable or keep changing my mind. The fact that I say the opposite of what I have just said really bothers my boyfriend, which I can understand.
I really want to change. I want to be able to express what I want without changing it to please others. 
Do you have any advices? 
Thanks in advance"
215,Looking and touching raw food makes me pass out.,"Everyone I tell this to finds this is really weird buuut ever since 2017, when I touch raw food (or eat rare steaks, etc.) sometimes makes my blood pressure drop. Sometimes to the point where I pass out.

Does anyone have a clue of what this might be??

Thanks in advance!"
216,urges,I have the urge to want to become a serial killer. To have the power to take other peoples lives.
217,Disconnected From Reality,"I'm not sure how I even start this off... At this point I know something is wrong with me. I'm only F14 and I don't really connect with anyone or at least I don't care about my friends or parents. I have a history of being really mean to people and doing a lot of illegal things. I have even caused one of my dogs to get killed. I use to be very mean to my dogs hitting them, trapping them outside, etc, when I was younger. I don't acknowledged my dogs anymore really or my parents. Just recently I got caught smoking weed in the bathrooms with my friend who I am just gonna say she is depressed. (she cuts herself and she has almost killed herself) I had to talk to a cop about smoking weed and I straight lied to him and somehow he didn't catch it. I got out of trouble very fast, I convinced my parents that basically that I've only smoked once. I've Vaped, Drinked, Smoked multiple times. My childhood has never been that great. My parents divorced when I was 5 and my mom lied to me about my dad hitting her and my dad has guilt tripped me about picking sides. I've been torn out of my dads arms and my stepdad almost got in a fight with my dad when my dad was dropping off some things that were my moms. My stepdad use to keep my food until I finished my homework. He cooked me burnt food (forced me to eat it). Whenever I go up to my dads he tells me my dad is a bad person, etc. I don't care about my mom or stepdad but I have to live with them. I've thought multiple times about ratting out my stepdad for having weed and cigarettes out in the open. But I still wanna see my friends. I tend to lie constantly and it gives me this feeling every time. I can't explain it but Its like I have to test people to see if they know i'm lying if they don't know i'm lying I continue to lie. I even off put my friends with obvious lies so when I do have to actually lie they think i'm telling the truth. I also put on kinda like a mask in a sense where I pretend to care but I really don't give a shit if one of my friends was to kill themselves. Also I have another problem where I tend to get angry very easily even if there is nothing to get angry at. I've almost flipped a table when my teacher said no to one of my questions. I Also do this thing at night or on the bus or in class where I like daydream... It kinda sounds crazy but Ill sit in class doing nothing for the whole period just daydreaming in a sense. The daydreams are very vivid such as what it would look like if I was to bring a gun to school. Or dissect kids in my class or shoot the person I hate the most. At night I pretend I am with someone from a movie or game and go on adventures killing people. There's a lot of killing in my daydreams and even dreams. It doesn't bother me that much. Well that reminds me I touched my dead great grandmas corpse when she was in the casket. Blood doesn't bother me in fact it kinda fascinates me in a sense. I remember when I was carving into my skin with a stake knife It was fun to wipe up all the blood and look at it the pain wasn't really there. OH and also I keep asking my parents to take me to a therapist but they say i'm perfectly fine."
218,Dealing with mental health alone.,"Why do people think they can deal with mental health alone? Would you try to deal with a broken arm alone? No!
Humans are social animals, we need each other so it makes sense we would need each other to overcome things. If your perception of the world is skewed and you believe the things that asshole on your head is telling you then how could you ever hope to pull yourself out of it alone? Yet people isolate themselves.
Thoughts?"
219,Help - My friend is showing suicidal tendencies and I don't know what to do. Any help is appreciated.,"I just found out tonight that my friend's wife found a noose in their basement yesterday that was tied to the rafters. He, thankfully, didnt hurt himself. 
He is a new dad and is having a hard time adjusting. I knew he was having some difficulty with it, but I wasnt aware it was this bad...
I am also a new dad. My wife and my friend's wife are really close, thats how I found out about this situation...
I am supposed to go ice fishing tomorrow with him and his wife asked if I can get him to open up. I of course want to do anything I can to help him, but he is generally a pretty closed book when it comes to this type of thing...so I have no idea what to do.
I am planning just trying to empathize with him and go from there...
Does anyone have any advice or dealt with a situation like this before?
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks."
220,I can’t be happy no matter what even if I think my life is actually not bad,"Ok, so this is my third post in less than a year in this subreddit. Let me explain in the shortest way possible:

I’m an artist, and in 1 year of being an artist I Ghathered up more than a 100.000 overall plays, someone actually paid me for verses, a lot of people wanna collab with me. I’ve recently dropped off my job, coming out of it with, like, 12.000€ in savings, and I’m getting money monthly from the State for the unemplyement (here in Italy, if you get fired the gouvernment pays you 70% of your last salary for a period of time). 3k€ of these savings will go in hair transplant because I need one and honesly I don’t think I could live as a bald guy in my 22 and so on.  Now, I was very happy and excited about anything before, mid this year, I noticed my hair loss was becoming evident to me and to others, since then, it’s like a switch turned up in my mind, and since then, my mood drastically changed. But even then, I could actually enjoy things now and then. But now, the more the days go by, the more I feel hopeless. I have anxiety all day, from the moment I wake tocthe moment I fall asleep. Lately I’m starting to have heavy panic attacks, chest pain ecc
I’d like to be a model since I know I can do it, I’m 1.90cm, blue eyes, pretty face and overall, I know that I can. Yes, I should have more hair, that’s why I’m getting a transplant. 
I told you about all those things to make you notice that overall, I don’t think my life is bad, actually you’d say is more than ok. But even so, I feel hopeless
When I picture myself in the future, there’s literally NOTHING that makes me feel ok. As a famous artist? I don’t see myself happy and relaxed. Rich lawyer? Nothing. As a nurse? Famous cook? Super super rich? Nothing
I just don’t want. I could get help from a professional, but even so, I’ll grow old, like everyone, and no professional psy can tell me that there’s a way to make me feel more calm about my fate and what’s going on: time it’s passing by
After 2 years of intense work as a waiter/barista, I wanted to have some rest. Bust I just can’t
I’m to tired to wake up early and go outside (i usally wake up not earlier than 1:00 PM), and if I stay home doing nothing, I get dread, heavy panic attacks because I know that I’m doing nothing and with nothing comes nothing
People say music helps but I can’t even write music anymore, or go outside, whatever I do deep down I know that these moments will end and eventully I’ll have to face my fate
I’m having bad memory problems too, like, I can’t recall the day, if I think back to the moment I woke up, say: Now it 10 PM and I woke up at 1 PM, in my mind it feels like 10 minutes have gone by when it’s actually 9 hours, and tocme feels like days are passing by in seconds, and I didn’t do anything: I accomplished nothing and I’m not even more rested as I spent the day in anxiety

How am I supposed to get out of this"
221,what am i,First off suck at grammer please work with [me.Do](https://me.Do) i have a condition i enjoy proving people wrong when i am doing things i just wanna do. I dont have empathy even to family and i enjoy watching people to understand their emotions.
222,Discovering I have Daddy Issues along with my Mommy Issues. Fun.,"So my mom abused me for 11 years, whatever. It's been obvious to me I have mommy issues. But recently I've realized I have Daddy issues. I realized when I ask my dad a question, how he dances around the question with jokes and essentially comes to ""whatever stop asking"". And I realized how he's always done this. I used to idolize him as the Disneyland Parent, the greatest and most caring dad in the world. But I realized that whenever I ask him a question he never gives me a straight answer, and never considers my opinion in anything related to me. He does not respect me as a person. I thought this was something recently, because he's aging or something, but I thought about it and realized he's always treated me like I wasn't worthy of an answer, because I wouldn't understand it or he just didn't want to spend that energy on me, and how it ultimately taught me not to question my mom's abuse. 
Now my dad's girlfriend is around. She talks to me and tells me when things are coming up. But still it's usually with little details, and when we agree on something (like her not spending the nights on Thursday night because that's my therapy night), she just casually breaks our agreements and then laughs it off. Neither of them think what I'm comfortable with is important and they barely ask me. 
I tried confronting my dad's absent parenting today, but he started getting angry and yelled about how he does so much. Why should he even feed me? 
I dont expect anything much helpful in the comments, I just really needed to rant. It must be teen angst. I just cant stand that I jumped from living in one toxic household to the next. This was supposed to be my saving grace.

223,My mental health is deteriorating...rapidly,"Not sure where to begin but I feel my mental health slipping away. I think it started around 7 years ago but the last 2-3 years its gotten much much worse and I dont know what to do or where to go for help. I constantly catch myself getting mad or upset over small things but now moreso than before I just go into this uncontrollable fit of rage, I try and distance myself from those around me during those moments I wouldn’t hurt them physically but verbally and emotionally. I’m even in my head screaming at myself to calm down and relax to take it easy and take some deep breaths but I dont even seem to listen to myself which is why I’m lost. I dont know what I’d need to do to help myself because if i cant even listen to myself to calm down why would I listen to someone else? Theres so much more to my story as is the case with everyone but this is the biggest problem at the moment i really wish I could change about myself."
224,I can't stop hurting myself or people around me,"Hi I am 29(m).

After a series of traumatic events that occurred late 2017 throughout 2019 spanning health issues (GI issues caused by a mold infestation from Hurricane Harvey), being cheated on and dumped(5 yr relationship with a fiance), and abuse from a narcissistic mother (moved in with her for 7 months after my health and mental crashed from the break up), I am now riddled with 24/7 thoughts of pure negativity and self-loathing. My friends have pretty much alienated me because they are tired of my shit and when they do talk to me I find ways to sneak my complaints in, pushing them further away. I'm getting therapy and treatment and that has given me some improvement and I am just starting family counseling with my mother, but none of it seems to be taking the edge off my constant negative thoughts. I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist in March, I'm hoping that will do something for my quickly deteriorating mind. I wasn't like this prior to my last relationship as my ex also had strong bouts of depression, although admittingly I was not capable or ready to handle it, and often I made it worse. I guess this is just karma for me, but I don't think she battled with this constant barrage of negative thoughts. I want to die but I realize I'm too afraid to pull the trigger myself. I am often reading self-help books and trying to regain my health as much as possible, it has improved a bit, but I am still deathly afraid I might revert back to how I was. NO matter what I do it's just a constant flow of self hate in my mind, and I am grateful I can actually sleep now (had insomnia for 3 straight months right after the initial break up), sleeping is really the only enjoyable thing in my life. I can understand why young men have some of the highest suicide rates, and I keep holding strong at the idea that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that's why I haven't done anything drastic yet. I am planning to move to San Diego this year as quickly as I can, not banking on that the move will fix anything, but I really enjoy SoCal and the city and hoping a place of my choosing will give me a bit more hope to grip onto. End of my vent, thanks for reading!"
225,"[vent]: domestic abuse, suicidal thoughts, low self esteem","I dunno what to write, I'm nervous.
I've been having problems with my family lately. I got a black eye. My body aches.

Now that my bruises are going purple, swollen, I'm forced to acknowledge my body which I hate, it all hurts, inside out.

I just dunno what to do"
226,Am I insane?,"I've been passed between so many NHS services over the past 10 years, with at most 8 sessions at a place before being passed elsewhere.
The general consensus is that I'm too hard to diagnose but it's starting to make me feel insane.
So I'm starting to question my sanity, and if I'm making everything up.

I suffered a fair amount of abuse growing up, and a lot of emotional abuse from my parents ever since. As a result I'm very unable to properly connect to the experiences I have and the people I'm around.

My question is, am I broken and making it up, or am I ill? I don't know what to do anymore. I went to A&amp;E last week because I thought I was going to kill myself and they discharged me because I'm on a waiting list so they can't help.

Am I making this up or am I hard to diagnose? I think I need reassurance...


TLDR: Am I insane or hard to treat?"
227,My friend has frequent panic/anxiety attacks and dissociation episodes. How can I comfort her?,"I’ve never been quite good with people with mental health problems, but I’m really close to one, and I really would like to help out.

I don’t see her much in person, so we usually just talk over text. Sometimes she’d have a panic attack or something and I really don’t know what to do. 

Thanks for your advice. I hope I can calm her down easier."
228,Im not sure if this is the right place to post this,"My girlfriend broke up with me about two months ago, been together for almost 3 years and it fucking sucks.
I know the right thing would be to let her go cuz she deserves better and all of that but it still fucking kills me inside out thinking about us not being together anymore... I truly love her with every single part of my body but she doesnt any more...
Ive tried the no ex contact shit but fail every time cuz I dont want to let her go just yet, but this lead to her blocking me 

Anyways all of this is causing me extreme stress, I’ve quit weed now after smoking for almost 10 years now but i feel so empty and almost suicidal which makes me wanna smoke all day long again(still staying strong). I have litterally cried every night since the break up and feel so alone without her. I feel like im never gonna stop loving her and probably wont cuz i truly went all in with my feelings for her.

Please help me, Im litterally shaking/consumed by depression"
229,I think I have a porn addiction. I find myself randomly relapsing. Tips?,
230,May get fired for a mental breakdown,"Lost it on the line at the start of the shift, I'm tired of being openly disrespected, treated like dogshit for shit pay. I fucking lost it on him, got sent home. Tomorrow shift taken away. Pretty sure he just doesn't have the balls to fire me."
231,Seperation anxiety?,"I’m 16 and i don’t like sleeping over somewhere if my mom isn’t there with me. It’s not like i can’t stay many hours without her but i always want her to be home before i go to sleep, i always want to know where she is or else i start overthinking and when i do sleepover  somewhere i cry/get upset at night because i would want to go back home to my mom. I only have this with my mom. This is also kind of effecting my life.

Is this normal or could i have seperation anxiety."
232,My cousin had his first manic episode.,"*My cousin has been one of my best friends for almost 20 years. He was the best man at my wedding.*

He's also one of the most calm, cool, and collected people I've ever met. His poise and awareness have always been admirable in my eyes. Most importantly he's never shown one sign of mental illness in the 20 years that we've grown up together.

Last week he was due to receive a promotion to CEO of his company, and during that meeting it started. Him and his girlfriend had to leave early. 

**He said they were going to the Amazon. He said the car didn't need gas. He said he didn't need money anymore, that we should all share. He threw his wallet out of the window.** 

His girlfriend, and sister eventually got him to our nearest mental health facility.

**He was taking pictures down off of the walls, he was dancing on tables. He was going into other patients rooms to steal their blankets, and to dump their trash bins on top of them. He stole an employees phone to call home. **

They're calling it a manic break. His workload has always been wild. He has never shied away from it, and cares deeply about his profession. He's someone who wants to be an impactful part of the community, and wants to make the world a better place. It appears he put too much on his plate. 

Those things he's done during this episode are not characteristic of the man that I know, so something is wrong. It appears to me that stress has eaten away at him, and maybe...just maybe triggered something permanent. I hope not, but I accept it as a possible outcome. 

I get to see him tomorrow. An hour visitation. I will go expecting nothing in particular. I'll be there to show him that I love him, and that I'll always be there to support him. Always, and forever. I'm very anxious to see him. His mother told me that he's more in touch with reality now. This eases the tension only slight of course, but I was happy to hear it. 

I don't know why I posted this to be completely honest. I've talked about it with my wife, and I've cried to her, because I'm scared. I also cried because I know he's alone right now, and could be scared himself. 

I thought some of you may have some experiences with behaviors or scenarios like this. Mostly it was just nice to type it out, but if you're reading I'd just like to leave you with this...

It's okay to not be okay.

It is OKAY to NOT be OKAY.

If you have a support system use it.

If you can't handle your work load dump it.

It is okay to not be okay.

If anyone has stories of their own, or may be able to add some context from their experiences I'd love to hear from you. Thank you for taking the time.

♥️"
233,Does this sound like anxiety? New(ish) symptoms making me a little worried,"I’ve made a similar post before but here it goes:
Since I was younger I’ve always convinced myself of things to be upset about, almost like I needed to dream something up to be anxious about like having bedbugs, lice, that my mom was going to kill herself while I slept, etc. 
The last few months I’ve noticed I’ve been very hot and cold with my boyfriend and getting upset at him for hating me or thinking I’m fat and things like that even though he doesn’t say any of that and replies with things like “no I love you!”  But I’ll just cry in bed and distance myself from him and say he hates me and is lying (I know this is abusive, I’m looking for therapy). Within the last few weeks I’ve also had similar situations where I’ve “decided” things like my mom is ignoring me as a punishment for upsetting my sister over Christmas break and that my sister got a dog to try and drive me out of the family (I have a fear of dogs) rather than simply because she wanted a companion. Both of these instances made me upset enough to lead to suicidal ideation, deciding I hate my mom, and blocking my sister because “I no longer wanted to have a relationship with someone who is trying to eliminate me from the family”. These thoughts come on suddenly rather than like when I was little and decided I must have bed bugs with no signs after watching a documentary on them. 
I assume these are the result of anxiety but I think I only really* experience social phobia. I’m slightly worried about it as I don’t want me being stressed for no reason to harm my relationships and keep making me upset. 

Am I just low self worth/anxious or could this be something bigger? I was worried about potential BPD or something and my old psychiatrist was still assessing me for bipolar 2 when I stopped going but I’m confident I don’t have either. I think I’m fine and “normal” until I get anxious/have thoughts like these- then I’m crying and want to SH etc"
234,just something i’ve wanted to say for a while now,I feel like i have no right to be sad because other people are going through so much worse. i’m always thinking of how people at school and friends would be so much better off without me. i feel like i don’t belong anywhere and no one actually likes me or enjoys being around me. i’ve been cutting for a while now and my family was aware of it but i don’t think they still know i’m doing it. i’ve brought up the topic multiple times of going to therapy with my mother but i don’t think i’ll ever get help. i’ve stopped telling my mother about it because i just feel like i’m annoying her. i don’t like venting to my friends anymore because i feel as if they’re eventually going to get fed up with me being so sad all the time and leave. i feel like such a fucking burden and i’m always thinking about killing myself. i just don’t wanna be here anymore but then again i don’t want my family to suffer. i’m sorry
235,Rain is so calming...,"I genuinely think that rain is my favourite weather even though it’s linked to being very miserable weather I think it’s very peaceful and especially when you feel like shit and can’t get to sleep or even just don’t want to sleep at all it really helps clear your mind a bit. 

Am I the only one?.. can’t be"
236,When I found out habits are just the brains automations.,"I never understood before the point of “being kind to yourself” 
-“being intentional”
-“regular eating habits” 

I have to admit I have had a lot of therapy and tools in my belt to access from to alleviate and overcome most of my difficulty’s now.

But all of my efforts today restructure my brain starting at some tomorrow and further, and that which haunts me is just simply automation from early observations and experiences.

Never thought I could achieve this for myself in a million years. But here I am"
237,My girlfriend is in the hospital for an undiagnosed rash all over her body and swelling in her joints,She's has about 10 injections and easily had blood taken 20 times in the last 2 days. She's so sick and miserable it's just so awful. She thinks I'm handling all of this well but driving to and from the hospital I'm having mini breakdowns and I haven't ate in 2 days and I haven't slept in the same time. I'm a wreck. Sleeping in the bed without her and seeing her go through all this pain is tipping my world upside down
238,I hate it when people say suicide attempts are for ‘attention’,"I have attempted a bunch of times and nobody knows except my parents, the nurses/doctors at the psych wards, my regular psychiatrist plus a few guys that I dated. If it was for attention, I would’ve been posting it all over social media so people can see that I, Erin (not my real name) attempted suicide. When I do talk about these things, I only do it only it online anonymously on Reddit and use a fake name so nobody knows who I am. I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if tons of people knew I attempted suicide."
239,Something is wrong with my mind,"So basically, I'm a grade 11 kid. Recently, I got this new war axe bc I love collecting those kind of stuff. When I hold on this axe, I immediately want to swing this on someone. I felt extremely guilty from this and don't know what to do. I'm going to refund this tmr, will the normal me be back when I refund it?"
240,I feel like my life is just crumbling,"It all started about 10 months ago right before I graduated highschool when I couldn’t decide a career for my future. Now I am in my second semester, still lost at what I want to do in life, lost the only girl I ever loved for two years 4 months ago and saw her get a new boyfriend in a month, I’m pretty sure I’m starting to lose hair, I can’t hold down a job because I’m too socially anxious, and the only thing going ok is my grades

I’m beyond overwhelmed and have had high blood pressure for 8 months AT 18 YEARS OLD. I’m not even severely overweight I fact I actually lost 30 pounds from lack of eating in months past

I’m so stressed. I miss having friends, I miss being loved and I feel like I’ll never find someone like her again, I miss knowing my place in this world or at least feeling genuine happiness. I sit inside all day and try to contact old friends but they always flake. 

And I bet my ex is out there following her passion in the military, can get any guys she wants, and spends each weekend with her new boyfriend out doing something fun. 

I feel just like I’m always losing at life. Even in our relationship I felt like I was always the worst partner and less motivated one. I feel like I’m just a waste of space. somedays I wonder if a car accident would just end this but I would never do anything stupid on purpose.

I just can’t help but feel like things won’t get better considering most of my life has been short bursts of happiness followed by pummeling pain to keep me in my place."
241,Just wanted to say thanks.,"Looking at and reading all of your posts has helped in the past. I sincerely hope everyone here who wants help is able to find what they need.

Unfortunately I'm done.

My family has cast me out, and they were my last hope. Hell, if I'm honest, i don't even want me.
So I'll catch y'all on the flipside. Tha k you for everything."
242,Rotten apple,"All I wanna do is cry, I’m at work rn which usually distracts me but not today. I feel like I’m ruining everything once everything starts to get good. I feel like I have no one to talk to bc I don’t want anyone to hurt with me or worry. I’m tired and at a road block. I don’t want to do anything but yet I get anxious when there’s nothing to do. I’m drained and don’t know how to fix myself if I’m unrepairable. I don’t know how to live with my traumas anymore."
243,How do I get help for someone that I believe has undiagnosed mental illness?,"Without getting into all of the details,  I have a family member(adult, married) that is not even able to hold a job due to emotional issues. They have had issues as long as I can remember and it has gotten progressively worse over the years. They have threatened self harm and been Baker Acted only to be released. While I understand that there are no guarantees, how can our family get help that will work? The doctors keep prescribing Ambien and I believe that is part of the problem."
244,Trauma Traditions,"TL;DR Any ideas of self traditions to manage anniversaries of traumas/ days that suck because of trauma? 

Today I was lying in bed and started thinking about my birthday. I'm turning 21 in March and it occured to me that I probably won't get any cards or whatever. I know this is a stupid thing to care about and I have better things to be upset about, but it's making me really sad. 

I left my parents a few years ago because they were emotionally and physically abusive (specifically when I showed signs of OCD) and I am incredibly proud of that choice. But it's hard having no one (I haven't spoken to any of my relatives since I fled). I have about six photos of my childhood because I wasn't able to take much when I left and around this time of year it really seems to get to me. Maybe it's that mother's day is coming up, or thinking about how if I had a different life I would get cards in the mail from relatives- regardless I feel like I am missing out. It almost feels like I'm less of a person because I don't have familial love. That sounds hella dramatic, but it's kind of true. 

I have an extremely small social circle because I often am bedridden because of my health and lately it kind of feels like the people I am friends with don't care about things the same way I do. I visit friends who live about an hour away once a month, despite it causing problems for my health and they never take the time visit me (even when I am extremely sick). I know they won't visit me for my birthday and likely won't do more than post on Facebook. My friends near by will likely spend time with me, but not in a birthday sense. It will just be a ""this Friday we will have a movie night instead of going out without her"" which doesn't really make me feel loved or celebrated, but instead kind of just reminds me that I'm not well enough to be a 20 year old and go out to the clubs and bars. 

Anyway, I'm trying to figure out how I can celebrate myself instead. For example, on the anniversary of leaving abuse I always get a ring. It's a physical way of seeing how far I've come and it makes me feel a little bit less sad. I want to do something similar for my birthday and mother's day- essentially create traditions that turn kind of shitty holidays for me into something that I can semi look forward to. If anyone has any ideas i would love to hear em! 

Sorry that this was a big old ramble!"
245,I’m freezing.,"No emotions. No tears. I’m cold. Stone cold.

246,Just venting,"Recently joined, I don’t know. Today was pretty rough. About a year ago I seemed treatment for my issues I’ve been battling since I was in middle school. I’m in my early twenties to put that into perspective. The last year has been a major stepping stone in my life. I’ve come a long way in terms of being healthier. Last night everything slipped and my mind fell into a chasm of spiraling self destructive thoughts and  I needed up hurting myself. I just hate the feeling of knowing that I’m better than this yet am apparently too weak to keep fighting it off. I know there’s always going to be a relapse. I know you just have to keep trying to cope in a healthy way. I just feel so ashamed for being how/who I am. For how it affects my loved ones. For how it affects my life. I just want to put that chapter of my life behind me. I have an amazing one ahead of me. I just need to keep moving forward I guess."
247,TW: My mother in my fifth grade year.,"Trigger Warning: Self-Injury

I don’t know what to think. I tend to forget things that happen to me, especially memories I consider bad. In fifth grade, my mental health declined and I turned to self-harm as a coping mechanism. My mother caught on. She once opened the door to check on me while I was in the bathroom. She also wanted to watch me shower. She told me how to shower, including washing. I think she touched me. I’m uncomfortable and I still wasn’t then. She cares, she’s just trying to tell me how to shower. She saw scars on my legs and said things like “Why are you doing this to yourself?”. I just remember staring down at my legs and feeling terrible. I stayed quiet. Why does this memory suck so much?? Sometimes I’m even scared to go into that bathroom because I’m scared she’ll decide to check up. Sometimes she mentions that she’s should watch me shower because I’m not showering well enough for her and I feel scared. What should I do and why does it take a toll on me so much?"
248,Does life get better?,I’m 23 and feel like I ruined my life for good. I’m not a criminal just a lonely fuck up
249,I really don’t know what the fuck I’m doing in life. I dunno if I’m just vibing or if I’m depressed or something.,"School is not going great at the moment, and I have so many assignments and stuff that I haven’t done yet. I don’t really do anything in class because I always feel like it’s too tiring to work. I’m often eating too much junk food, but it’s mostly on the weekends. I ate a whole bag of chips yesterday, but at least they weren’t potato chips (I think they were made from lentils or something). I’m always waiting on the weekend, because then I can finally sleep and just chill. I never go out during the weekends. 

I’m a bit off topic now, so back to what I was thinking in the beginning. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. Nothing ever changes in my life, it’s like everything is just repeating. The only thing that is sometimes changing, is the setting (where I live/exist), and the stuff that’s happening around me. 

I don’t know if I’m happy or sad. I get to school, laugh with my only friend, have my classes, then just go home again. When I laugh with my friend I think I am happy, but I don’t know. When I get home, my parents are sometimes fighting, and I start to get this bad feeling. It’s not always the same feeling, but it’s often a kinda heavy or empty feeling. I often think I have to cry, but then I never can. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

Sorry for writing this long, it’s 3 am and I’m just so tired right now. Ignore all of my misspellings and my other mistakes. Congratulations to you if you made it to the end of this text, or maybe sorry. Haha, I don’t know. Now I’m going to get some sleep, good night."
250,Is it normal?...,"... To cry/feel like crying a couple of times a week? And not really know why?

I would know if I was crying because I was upset, or hurt, or stressed. I don’t know why I’m crying randomly as of lately.

I try not to judge my feelings and just let myself cry and feel the feeling - and I do - and afterwards I feel better (as per usual), and I don’t even think twice about it. Its so casual.

I just wanted to know if anyone else is in the same boat? Or if it happens to others? I just don’t have a large pool of people to ask - so I thought this might be a fitting place.

Thank you for any answers!

Also - I take care of myself. My mental health is better than it’s ever been, along with just about everything else in my life. I feel like I’m pretty happy and stable - so just a little FYI. 👍"
251,What may be causing this?,"At the moment, I'm feeling down and a bit angry. When I get this way, I tend to want to deny affection to my family. Like just now I literally told my young daughter I didn't want her to cuddle with me, I wanted to be alone. What's wrong with me?"
252,I feel like no one would care or notice if I died aside from parents and dog,"I'm not necessarily suicidal at the moment.  But this has always been a question on my mind, whether anyone would care or notice if I died aside from the obvious answers being my parents and my dog.  Problem is that realistically, I'm going to outlive my parents and my dog, so if that happens, who would be left?

Sometimes friends would say stuff like they would care, but I always felt like that is somewhat contradictory because realistically they wouldn't notice in the first place, so how could they care?  I feel like I'm always the one who's trying to strike up conversations or plan events with people just to maintain any semblance of contact with them.  So I feel like if I'm gone, they wouldn't even notice and would just carry on with their lives.  

I've been told that it might just be due to people being busy with their lives to try and maintain contact and stuff.  But in this case, am I just the odd one out for trying to keep friendships with people?  Assuming everyone at one point in their lives becomes too busy to maintain contact, doesn't that mean for certain that in the end no one would care when I died?"
253,How do i make a daily schedule that wont be too hard to follow?,i’ve kind of been thinking of this for a while yet i spend All day in bed on my phone with no contact with anyone cuz i barley have been using my social media &amp; ik its embarrasing for being 18 but i spend most of the time playing games on my phone😳 my psychiatrist said to have a routine to follow but i dont know where to start
254,What the fuck is wrong with you?,"So I was in the bathroom &amp; my dad asks what I’m doing in there, so I just say “none of your business”. I don’t like telling people what I’m doing in the bathroom like any normal human being I like my privacy, he barks “stop with that attitude” this made no sense to me, i was in the bathroom, you don’t need to know what I’m doing in there. He takes away the cord to my desktop. I can tell that he’s drunk; his voice &amp; also it’s the weekend so it’s the same old fucking routine. when he’s sober he doesn’t really care what my siblings &amp; me do. That’s how I like it by the way. I just wish my mom didn’t work so late, but then again, if my mom was here she would of just yelled at him. I’m sick and tired of living like this. It’s the same thing over &amp; over again. My life is predictable, it’s boring. I’m bored of my own life. Sometimes I wish I could run away, I don’t care what happens to me. I just don’t want an alcoholic ex vet dad &amp; a stressed smoker mom. Don’t get me wrong I’m not spoiled, I am very self aware of what my parents do to get me the stuff I want or need,I just. I don’t know. I need to get a new life."
255,I'm a disappointment. I wish I wasn't so sorry all the time.,"So I've mentioned this before on other subreddits: r/Guilt, r/depression maybe... eh.

This is going to sound MEGA pathetic... but...

Well, anyway... I'm mentioning it here because I'm sick of the pain and I really need help. Yes, I am seeking therapy, but it won't happen for a while. I'm also trying to be as open-minded as I can to the idea of therapy, but it's very depressing being told there are so limited options (that I know of) to help cease this pain. Drugs, talking, crying, sleep.

None of those have ever really helped tremendously... Although they have succeeded in calming me for certain amounts of time.

The story is, I'm a transgender male (FTM) and I only came out to my family (most of them anyway,) a year ago. I'm currently still in High School. My mother accepts me wholeheartedly and does whatever she can to support me. She brags about me to her family and does her best to show me off whenever she can. She also has Reddit... so I hope she doesn't find this. (Fuck.)

My father, not so much. He told me-- when I first came out-- that it went against his Christian beliefs, and that there'd be ""certain rules about this,"" as long as I were ""under his roof,"" which meant that he was not going to allow me to transition, or at least he'd put up a big ass fight... and obviously I'm not old enough to leave, nor do I want to. My mom, brother, and dog are here, and I'd hate to leave them. Plus, I don't know the first thing about the adult world, mostly because of my (pretty crippling) anxiety (diagnosed.)

It didn't register for a while, but when it did, it hit me like a fucking truck. I was remembering all the times we shared together:

* Waking up for Kindergarten and eating Honey Buns while watching Max &amp; Ruby,
* Him making me full bubble baths, and me making bubble-pies to ""serve"" him,
* Him saying my prayers and tucking me in at night,
* Him reading a book to me about a girl and her daddy: ""Would you still love me if I were a dinosaur? Or a nasty fly? Or a crazy horse??"" and the daddy saying: ""Yes, of course, I'll always love you - No matter what.""
* Us going out on the porch of our old apartment, and grilling. I'd never grill because I was too young, but I'd keep him company and watch geese. He called me his ""grilling buddy.""

It felt like a major punch to the gut, as if all of that was completely fake. As if all of it meant absolutely nothing... because he never valued me as a person. The only thing he saw in his ""daughter"" was the sexual organs and gender stereotypes I was given... and It felt like pulling off a BIG ASS bandaid. Maybe even removing a cast...

But eventually, that pain was pushed into the filing cabinet of shit in my brain, and thrown into the dark closet I was once in, never to be opened for very long again. Then, my parents began to argue more. They'd argue when my brother and I weren't home, and they'd sometimes argue when we were. If they did, he'd usually try to drag us into it.

My mom edited my school info, telling them of my preferred name and pronouns and such, and he tried numerous times to edit that, and erase whatever my mom had put. He's not a bad person, and I'll always love my dad, but that shit really fucking hurts... I've been doing my best not to ask him for much anymore. If he wants to give me something, I'll accept, but I usually don't ask for anything myself, because I feel as if he's trying to buy me back like he always does after something happens. 

We went to the transgender clinic, and at one point I got very excited, as the doctors were talking about Testosterone. I was ecstatic until I looked over and noticed my parents. My dad looked so dead inside... my mom was crying. I basically asked her ""what's wrong"" with my eyes, because words wouldn't come out. She said, ""It's a mourning period."" 

That was the straw that broke the camel's back... and broke my fucking heart. She still doesn't understand why it hurt me so much, and I can't tell her because of-- VOILA-- anxiety. I remember feeling the worst anger, the deepest depression, and the most crawling guilt I'd ever felt, and all at once.

That hurt more than what my dad had said did. Because I felt she was completely on my side, and didn't care about what voice, name, or reproductive pieces I had. I felt she understood my struggle, as much as a Cis person and a mother could. Hearing those words fucked me up in the head. It made me realize that everything bad that'd been happening was my fault.

Them fighting, my fault.

Them crying, my fault.

Their dreams for their little girl growing into a woman being crushed into dust, my fault. 

Parents have everything 100% planned out for you from the day you're born. And because of me, those plans were ruined. I felt so fucking guilty and sad, I didn't know what to do with myself. I wanted to disappear forever. I wanted to ask the God I didn't believe in ""WHY"" this was happening to me? I knew that sounded pathetic. There are/were people living in much worse situations. I felt/feel I had no right to complain about something so insignificant. 

I mean what the hell's wrong with me? This lump of muscle and knowledge in this thick ass skull... what does it do? It twists into a fucking Rubix cube puzzle, and ends up making younger me feel like he's ""technically killed someone.""

I'd already felt like that, but hearing those words made it all... real, kind of. In a way. 

I felt like a LITERAL murderer because I wanted to be myself. ""What if I'm not me, and old me is dead?"" ""What if I killed me?"" and then ""That's ridiculous, retard! YOU are you, and you can't kill yourself and then still be alive!"" It flipped on and off from ""That's absurd and pathetic that you'd think that!"" and ""But It's true. I've ruined their view of me and killed the person I was... I'm an awful person."" Blah, blah, blah...

This shit comes back STILL, almost weekly/monthly.

I wish I wasn't so fucking sorry... I wish I could tell her how she made me feel because I know she didn't mean it the way my stupid ass brain took it. Did she? 

Sometimes I just wish I could vanish and everyone's lives I've been in would be better without me... (although I'm not suicidal, as I have an irrational fear of death.)

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I feel guilty over shit I cannot control because my stupid adolescent brain took words and twisted them wrong. I need help, but help is a long ways away.

256,"Anxiety attacks all week, is this normal?","Hello I'm not really sure if this is ok but I don't know what to do. Also sorry I'm on mobile. Also also, I've been posting this in a few other subs and so far no responses. 

2 years ago I suddenly just felt like I was having a heart attack while at work and went home early. I had shortness of breath, tightness in my chest, and just felt like I was going to die. I put off going to the doctor as long as I could since I didn't have health care. The feeling would come and go throughout the day, getting worse around bedtime. After about 5 days I went to an emergency room and found out it wasn't a heart attack and I was told I had Gerd. They said my esophagus was inflamed and that may explain some symptoms. I eat a lot of fast food so it made sense to me. The symptoms had almost completely disappeared at that point so I took the medicine for Gerd that they gave me and I was fine for about a year.

After a year I had another week long episode and at this point I figured it was just panic attacks or anxiety brought on from my shitty diet. I didn't go to the doctor that time and things just sorted themselves out. I was fine for another 9 months or so.

A couple months ago, at the end of December, I got the flu and felt horrible for a few days. One of those days I suddenly started feeling the same symptoms that I had felt before. I remember very clearly how quickly it came over me while I was sitting down in my living room. By this time I could recognize what was happening and just kept telling myself that I was going to eventually be ok but this time I now had a second job and was working 6 days a week. This new job isn't as flexible with calling out sick so when the time came I tried to just power through the work day. I did half a shift and left early. What I now believe to be anxiety was just too much to handle being at work. 

I tried again the next day but again had to call my boss to leave early and had a full blown attack while trying to talk to him over the phone. To his credit he was very understanding and talked with me until another supervisor could come to me and help make sure I was OK. I just sat there and tried to breathe for 20 minutes. My face was numb/tingly, and my heart was beating hard. I eventually collected myself and was even able to drive myself home.

I went to the emergency room again with my dad, still focusing on breathing, and eventually saw a doctor. The doctor told me that my lungs weren't able to expand all the way and take full breathes due to inflammation in my body probably brought on from the flu. I expressed my concern that this may not be the entire problem and that I was afraid that I had some kind of anxiety issue. She gave me medicine to deal with the inflammation, an inhaler for my lungs, and some Ativan just in case. I took everything except the Ativan and was feeling fine after a couple days.

That brings us to now. I started feeling these symptoms again, just a little over a month after the last episode. I could sort of feel it coming on last Wednesday and decided to take an Ativan. It calmed me down and I slept like a baby that night. Monday it came in full swing. I've had to focus on my breathing non stop this whole week.

 I've broken down in tears twice worrying that I'm worrying my family. Worried that I may have to quit my jobs. Worrying that this is how my life will be from now on. Worrying that if I rely on Ativan to get me through this then I'll never really recover. I've already dropped my calculus class that I was taking at my local college. Last month I started the process of getting healthcare and my case worker says to expect a letter in the mail in the next week or two about my coverage. It could be a few weeks after that before I could schedule a full physical. I had to leave work early again today and typing all this out is helping a little but I'm very scared right now.

I know this isn't a place for diagnosis or medical advise but I just wanted see how you all felt about this. Is it typical for people to have week long anxiety attacks? I had a few hours yesterday where I almost felt completely normal again but it all came back. I've only been eating a couple of handfuls of grapes and maybe a banana a day out of fear that I might worsen my condition. I've also noticed that keeping myself busy with something or walking around outside helps but both of my jobs require me to drive in trucks for most of my shifts.

Thanks for reading and sorry if this isn't appropriate for this sub"
257,I can’t stand people that lie about their mental health.,"A family member of mine is always telling me how her friend is so much worse than me, cant leave the house due to her anxiety, can’t drive and can’t do anything for herself.

I know this friend. She goes on outings ALL the time (that she drives to) and she recently went on a holiday. My family member told me a couple of weeks ago that this friend has even started working cash in hand while also receiving government benefits. 

I don’t doubt that she does have mental health issues. But it’s really irritating me that I’m constantly being compared to her, when a lot of the things she says about her mental health aren’t even true. 

This is why a lot of people don’t get taken seriously."
258,How do I talk to my psychiatrist about PTSD?,"I have a regular twice-yearly check-in with my psychiatrist, who manages my medication for my depression and anxiety. However, I've never told him about my struggles with domestic abuse (it was in the past, I am safe now). I thought I had my anxiety under control and it didn't effect me, but for some reason for about the past 8 months I've been really struggling. I don't get much sleep because I get nightmares where I relive some of my worst moments. I get panic attacks any time I'm in loud areas or my brain makes some sort of connections to my abuse. More recently I've been having actual flashbacks, and it's really been taking a toll on me. 

I think these are all signs of PTSD, but I'm really unsure of how to talk about this with my psychiatrist. I'm going in for a regular check-in kind of thing, so he's not really expecting me to say anything is wrong, he just needs to see me a couple of times a year so he can sign off on my antidepressants. I'm just struggling with the actual wording of how I should bring it up. Should I mention that I think I have PTSD? Or should I tell him my symptoms and see if he thinks that's what it is? Should I bring it up, or should I wait to see if he asks me if there's anything bothering me? 

Clearly, discussing it in general makes me really nervous, I would just appreciate any tips on how to navigate this conversation."
259,Is it rude to not look at and barely interact with people when you are not feeling well.,"I live with a friend who is having mental health problems. He has been mostly holed up in his room but we passed each other in the door to our apartment yesterday and he just ran by me and turned his back to avoid looking at me and mumbled something about being in a rush. It really hurt my feelings because I felt invisible or unwanted and unwelcome. I know he's not feeling great and I dont expect a conversation or anything. Just for him to pause momentarily and acknowledge my existence and tell me he cant talk. We are normally very close but when he is not doing great he withdraws.

I'm legitimately not sure if this behavior is something I have a right to be upset about. Am I overreacting and making an small issue all about me?

I have severe anxiety issues and this triggers them every time. I made a stressed out comment when he did it. Something like "" what you're not even going to look at me then""? 

He later texted me that he just doesn't want to interact with anyone. 

But it stresses me out when I live with someone who is not even showing me what I would consider to be basic courtesy. I need another perspective since I have been ruminating between angry, her and guilty since yesterday and now I'm afraid to go home.

Talking to him is not an option until he feels better. I tried asking him last night if we could talk for a minute when I saw him down the hall and he said ""sorry now not a good time"" and went back to his room."
260,i don’t feel human,"i am socially inept. i never experienced things normal people have experienced. i don’t know how to socialize. people don’t want me. they don’t see me.

it hurts to be 27 years old and to never have had friends. to go out, see people talking and having someone by their side, and knowing i could never have that. how normal it is for them to be normal. 

I am the result of when modern medicine interferes with natural selection. i should have never been born. 

i try to feel okay in my own coping mechanisms, but at the end of the day i will always be not normal. not human. 

perhaps suicide is indeed natural selection. the way a scorpio stings itself when they can’t escape fire."
261,hello!,"lately, ive been feeling completely numb? and just cannot handle anything. ive been feeling down but i cant feel it, and its the worst feeling ever. some guy i liked for some time, i found out he did the same things with me like he did with my best friend and im sitting in my room drunk and cannot cope with it. dont knwo why im wriring this but i literally cannot feel one single thing, had to let it out advice would be appreciated , &lt;3 i just want to let it out"
262,I withdrawn from my meds for weeks now... and I’m just afraid that I’ll be relapsing soon,"What should I do? I stopped my meds (without my doctor’s knowing). I haven’t made an appointment with her again for two months now. Okay. I stopped taking my meds because
1. I rarely (like super rare) get attacks now. 
2. It’s too expensive. I’m kinda tight on my budget right now.
3. I don’t want to rely my sleep on the meds. 
Ugghh. I don’t know. I’m anxious for weeks now thinking I might relapse soon. That all the progress I made for the past months will all go down to waste.
What should I do?"
263,"Got obsession in control, interests disappeared with it","I don't know where exactly to post this because it deals with so many different issues. I can think of at least 3 different subs where this could be relevant but this feels the most neutral.

I'm basically a 27 year old autistic that's struggled with ptsd, depression, and obsessive tendencies. Recently I've managed to get my obsessive tendencies under control through therapy and medication, but it turns out that it was not only a coping mechanism for my anxiety, but also the basis that fueled the passion for my interests.

Normally I'm into programming, building computers, video games, and doing small related projects. Particularly vintage stuff. I've intermittently lost or switched interests between them, but this is the first time in my life I feel completely burned out on them. All the passion and nostalgia that fueled it is gone. I've even tried to play my favorite ""when all else fails"" games, read tech articles, watch YouTube channels, but nothing works anymore.

Now, this wouldn't be a problem if I had something else to go to. I don't, I've tried broadening my interests for years but nothing really stuck. Piano, drawing, writing, volunteering at an animal shelter, etc. 

The obvious conclusion is that I'm depressed, but that's nothing new and now all I want to do is sleep anymore for no other reason than I'm bored.

Will my interests ever come back without the obsession? Is there a way to actually find another that sticks? Do I just need to get through the adjustment of not having an obsessive mind 24/7 anymore? Technology is all I've ever known so I don't know where else to go, especially because I code for a living."
264,Old photos and painful memories.,"No making excuses for it, when I crashed, I crashed hard. I lost almost all of my friends, my career that I loved, and became a generally toxic, volatile, isolated person. That being said every time I open my camera roll, or worse, cloud photo storage, i'm crushed with photos of happier times, with people that will never speak to me again. Bridges are burned and a large chapter in my life is permanently closed. I just don't know what to do about them. I hold the memories so dear, but they're so painful to look at. Do I destroy them? Embrace them? Upload them to offsite storage and bury it? I'm conflicted, and just thinking about it hurts. 

Advice is appreciated."
265,Being attacked for being white and having mental illnesses 😂🤔,"So recently I have been diagnoses with two um, illnesses so far which are basically similar to another. Schizophrenia, Psychosis, and actually theres a lot more. Depersonalization, dissociation, derealization, depression, anxiety. And guess what none of my medication works. I havent had a single psychosis pill that has helped so far and I've been on well over 3-4 different ones. Anyways that's just context I guess. 

Recently theres been a few females who are on the opposite side of my political spectrum who have been attacking me in groups, verbally, for being white lol. I then tell them I'm sorry but thanks to my mental illnesses I react incorrectly many times but I do not change my political views on being offended. They then call me racist for some reason? Idk. They say having mental illnesses isnt an excuse to be like who I am? Interesting, so if I was Deaf I should just hear? Sounds good. I also honestly probably have BPD I wouldn't be surprised. And also amnesia or something. Sorry I'm just going on I guess lol. 

You know it really sucks having all these illnesses and I've gotten so used to them it feels normal. 24/7 I have an out of body experience. Like right now I feel like I can see myself typing this from the window lol. Creepy right? And the funny part is distractions dont work anymore, all the way from showering to playing games to pain. None of it helps and no one understands how overwhelmed I am. And then I get ""well you act normal"" LOL thanks, I have a problem with showing my emotions I forgot which illness does that, probably psychosis? Idk but like I feel like I'm going crazy but my illnesses and my intellect are having a fucking world war 200 tbh cause holy fuck it's the worst feeling of my life. And I cant kill myself because that's selfish and I'd rather die than be selfish. Lol get it cause- nvm."
266,Can thoughtbroadcasting be extinguished,"I don't say things often because I feel like who ever is there already heard me think it. 

Also live tv makes me leave the room or distract myself from it because I feel too connected to  who is speaking.

267,Mental Illness,"
Mental illness, “a disease or period of sickness affecting the body or mind”. Mental illness is a little cockroach that creeped in there like a parasite. But, they can’t be surgically removed or killed. The disease is just there. There is no medication or treatment to fully help. I am mentally ill and there is nothing I can do. There is nothing. No treatment, medication, facility that will help. Just imagine a helpless maple leaf just being carried by the wind. There is absolutely nothing that will help. The only thing is that some days, things are better. I strive to make all days like that. 


What happened? What happened to humanity that they can’t make one part of the body not malfunction. No one has found a cure for, PTSD, DID, BPD, BD, or any other mental illness. I want to be better. I need to be better for my sake. I want to influence people and to make sure they know it gets better. But, how can I say that and not believe it. It is just the seedling, the little white lie. Is there something I did? Is this genetic? What are the causes? There are a number of endless questions. We never know what will come our way so we hide behind the rock. We don’t come out, not ever. 


We all suffer. Slowly going down the drain. We will all dissolve at one point. We all have our own problems that we can’t handle. Why is that? Why do we all need to suffer and bleed out in pain, just to be human? We developed from millions of generations of dinosaurs. They didn’t have mental illness, so why do we? Why do we need to constantly be in pain? Why are we even here? What was the point of that, to be here. Did someone mess with us?  Did God or the Devil mess with us to pay for what destruction we have done? Do we really deserve this?


My life has been a slow train slowly, and not knowingly about to crash. We all have our problems but why do we need too? Is there some sort of obligation? What is the point of depression, anxiety, stress? Why does life need to be stressful to be a life? We never deserve to be in such pain but we are anyway. We are human but not some rats in a lab. We can’t be mutated to be mentally ill. We are living, breathing, organisms that just want some joy. Why are some people better off than others?


We don’t deserve pain. We need nerves in our body but why do we feel pain? Is it “God’s Plan”? Will it happen in a few years that we will never feel pain anymore? I wish that I was healthy. I wish I was like the other girls, but why? Why do I think that so automatically. I am jealous of the girls walking around with their group of friends who love them and are true friends. Why can’t I have that? Do we really need friends? I like being alone but I am so lonely. I can’t tell anyone who I am. I just need something to get me through day."

You cant label your decision cause you dont know all out comes. repost dont know if right
269,What to do when you have nothing to do?,"So again I’m working on parts of my mental health and I tend to find myself in the worst spots when I have time on my hands. I don’t know how to relax, I feel like my hands always need to be doing something or I need to be constantly moving. I take meds for depression and bipolar as well as a few other things. My question is how do you relax? Honestly, my body is so tense when I try to just sit there and watch a show or just listen to music. I don’t drink, smoke weed maybe 3 times a month and this is a problem I face a lot. I basically don’t like to give myself down time but I know we all need it. We need time to just be lazy or relax and I just can’t let my guard down to do so."
270,Is it normal to not fully compreheand your refelection is you?,"   So that sounded weird. What I mean is that when I look in the mirror, I understand that that is me. That is what I look like. But there's an underlying thought that my reflection isn't right. That's not me. That can't be me. Ion knows if it's just because my brain thinks reflections are weird or if there is something wrong or what but I find it strange. And when I imagine myself it's blurry almost, like an incomplete image. I just have an idea, I don't really know."
271,I just wanna feel heard,"These past few weeks have been nothing but terrible for me. I just got out of a relationship that I really was comfortable in, and I poured everything in that relationship. I barely talk to people because all of my problems were shared to my s/o, but now that we're over, I tried to talk to other people but they really don't care about my problems. They say ""Aww"" and ""I'm here for you"" but I know that they really don't care. I can see it with their looks and response. In this world full of ""I wanna talk about myself all the time,"" I try my best to be a good listener so people will also listen to me, but they don't. It's always ""OMG SAME"" and then they tall about themselves, completely disregarding the problem, which is me. I am tired and I really just wanna talk to someone who wants to listen, because I am tired. I am tired of WANTING to be heard. I just wanna be heard."
272,What should I do if I wanna die?,"I wanna die because know that in the future my parents will get sicker and sicker then die and the same will happen to me too, I don’t see the point of living if death is inevitable no matter what."
273,I'm starting to realize that people treat me differently,"TW: depression

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a little weird, like, goofy, but I could make people laugh, so I went with it. That was my job in the workplace, it was great, I had found my niche.  But I'm starting to realize that I'm treated differently by certain people. I've been depressed since I got out of high school, 2011, so now my mom has been ""walking on eggshells"" since then. Which I get, and I'm really sorry for, because she's here for me. She'll message ""I'm worried about you"" out of the blue, and if I postpone a visit because I have a cold, she'll assume the worst case scenario or that I'm lying to her. She also points out my symptoms quite a bit, like I sweat ***WAY*** too much because of the pills I'm on, but my doctor doesn't want to change them, or he didn't the last time I asked. And the pills work, apart from the sweating. It's like the smallest amount of physical exercise, bringing the groceries in, makes me sweat, and it lasts for a good 15 minutes each time. Sometimes I wake up clammy. It's brutal. So my mom will go ""you're melting"" like yeah I know, Sarah, Thanks. She'll also tell me to calm down, when I'm just telling a story. She thinks I'm very reactive, and she says it will interfere with my work.   


I've been out of work since last easter, when I told my boss I was depressed, but fortunately I had the most significant amount of money I'll ever have come in in the form of inheritance. So I've been living off of that, just coasting, figuring out where I'm going to live and what I'm going to do. I got yelled at for smoking weed at my mom's house, I was just a real shitty person all around, you know? But she still has me around. I love her. I'm going to hell.   


Anyway, I kind of get distracted a lot, you know? So my boyfriend brought home shopping and I accidentally left out a box of frozen ginger beef, and I found it today, and he found it after me, and he said ""I knew I should have checked that you put everything away"" which, fair enough, but it makes me think that he's always thinking of me as a spazz? It makes me feel like people are hyper aware of me which is not what I want.   


I'm also realizing that I was one of the special kids in school, I had problems in every school I went to, like I was very impulsive and I can remember 2 or 3 times that teachers just yelled at me for having a messy locker or cubby, like I would forget my lunch in there sometimes, and the teacher would just trash my locker in anger. Another time a teacher made fun of me because I didn't know my high up french numbers, like I just never learned. I was in french immersion, grade 7. Quatre-vinght-dix-neuf, that kind of thing. In grade 6 I would be taken out of class once a week for child therapy disguised as a puzzle with Miss Schneider, and the kid who whipped his dick out in grade 2. I freaked out at my mom when she got them to stop. I was not well adjusted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in scottish dance and soccer when I was little, but I quit both teams at once, I can't remember what I said to my mom but I was being bullied. Or, that's what the bully told me in high school when we met again. I believed her. I wasn't really good at either activity, but I look at adult scottish dancers now and I'm really envious, and I miss it.   


One time my best friend told me I smelled bad when the heat in the car was on, which I don't think is normal, but I was really deep in the depression hole at the time so I think that's forgivable. And my mom put me in a school that was not my first language, when I was 5. My mom and dad never lived together, so that probably didn't help. I'm just like....trying to learn to live for the first time  in 26 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to feel about all this. I need to go back to therapy. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest."
274,Struggling,"Friday I couldn't go to work. I felt like I was going to cry and couldn't breathe and shivering. It wouldn't stop until I had lots of weed.

Everything is building. The pressure. The therapy I've waited this long for turned out to be bogus. So I'm seeing my bffsin March 

After i get back from hell trip with my NM. Which when I think about leaving my partners behind for 9 days and a 9 hour time difference I want to cry. Ive made plans with them in coping. But my mental health being i  the shit is making this harder 

I've fully relapsed. I've purged more than i have since college. 
My weight keeps going up because I don't have the spoons to do exercise (which makes my chronic pain worse). And calorie counts only make my anxiety worse. 

I feel like a failure. 

Even though I'm back on track for budgeting. I'm starting amazing therapy in 3 weeks. My relationships with my partners has never been better. 

I feel like a failure. I can't stay well. I can't stay fit. I can't do anything like that long term! WHY DO I KEEP FAILING. WHY DOES WANTING TO BE FIT AND HEALTHY AND EATING PROPERLY NOT BE ENOUGH TO DO IT"
275,Looking for Medication Recommendations for Multiple Disorders,"Hello, I'm looking for some advice on medicine I have bipolar disorder, asperger's syndrome, GAD, ADHD, OCD and agoraphobia.

My main issue lately has been anxiety. I have this constant feeling that's hard to describe. It's sort of like being on edge and feeling constantly alert. I guess you could say on the edge of your seat type of feeling. Along with this is feeling uncomfortable with like clothes bothering me or position of something in room bothering me thus triggering my OCD.

Another thing is that I've been having some problems with irritability and anger. They are pretty much all internal and I don't show them. Occasionally I'll tell my Mom who I'm close to. The irritability is just simply feeling annoyed at small things or whatever.  However the anger which is separate is like being unable to get over things/holding grudges.

Also, while it doesn't cause any problems or anything, I sometimes feel like I'm hearing background noise, like as if my Dad's watching TV in other room or something. When I actually notice the thought, I know it's not noise, so it's not really a hallucination. I think this has to do with that constant feeling of being on edge.

The main thing I'm concerned with is the anxious feeling. If the feeling isn't described clear enough to understand what it is, please ask me for more details.

The main psych meds I'm currently on are:

Adderall 20mg 3x/day (morning, mid-day, night) (for ADHD)
Buspar 30mg 3x/day (morning, mid-day, night) (for anxiety)
Gabapentin 400mg 3x/day (morning, mid-day, night) (for anxiety)
Lamictal 200mg 2x/day (morning, night) (for bipolar)
Geodon 60mg 1x/day (morning) (for bipolar)
Geodon 80mg 1x/day (night) (for bipolar)
Pregabalin 50mg 3x/day (morning, mid-day, night) (for anxiety)
Effexor 150mg 1x/day (night I think) (for bipolar)"
276,Friendly Reminder!!!,If you’re taking medication make sure you go take it! (Throwing this into the universe because I nearly forgot to take my meds tonight)
277,Always tired....,"So, I have a diagnosis of dysthymia and acute anxiety disorder. I can't afford therapy right now even though I want to go. I feel SOOO tired all the time, especially when I have important things to do like clean or study. Right now I work part time and am getting my graduate degree full time, which is overwhelming. I sleep 9+ hours every night, and I still wake up immediately exhausted. I've even tried sleeping like 7 hours and it just made everything worse. I think I sleep so much because of my dysthymia and not being motivated to do anything. I want to start exercising to see if that helps with managing my symptoms, but I never have the motivation to even do important tasks. Does anyone have recommendations on supplements/things that help them with lack of motivation? (Not interested in Pot/CBD recommendations)"
278,My friend stole my meds,"My friend stole half my bottle of wellbutrin. Then told me she likes them because they give her a similar high to when she was on meth. Should I be concerned? I don't plan on being her friend anymore after this. My dr won't refill it early either. So now, I'm gonna be 2 weeks short. I'm also really mad at her."
279,opinions on therapy,"i have a feeling this is very controversial. but i can’t be the only who feels that therapy just doesn’t work for me. ive gone to many therapists, each for a long period of time. all that happens is i have an anxiety attack for the session, go home, try to apply the tactics they suggested, and only feel worse.ive always been very open to it but have never gotten good results. i was diagnosed with depression. my opinions were therapy and medication. therapy didn’t work. meds terrify me. so what else is there? i’m so happy that it works for most people and it’s really beneficial but i just feel like no one talks about it not working for some people."
280,Negative emotions when listening to certain genre of music.,"So background story. Right after I graduated high school I was not in a good mental state. I had a lot of mental break downs in a week. During that period of time I would listen to a certain subculture of mental music during the those mental breakdown. 

 I just need advice, now that I'm in a better mental state. I would like to go back and listen to some of those bands during that time period because I do like the music and miss listening to it. My problem is when I start listening to a song. I start to get into a depressive state. 

 I want to stop avoiding listening to these band because of my reaction to listening to the music. How do I start to try to separate these negative feelings with these bands/songs?"
281,What’s something you wish your therapist had told you?,What’s something that you’ve figured out but wish you’d heard earlier? Or something one of your therapists have said to you that really resonated with you?
282,Why are so many mental illnesses and disorders so similar?,"This past year and a half I’ve been working a lot on mental health. I go to therapy, group therapy, have met with any psychologists and psychiatrists, and I’m managing my mental illness loads better than I ever had in my life. I’ve also learned a lot too.

One thing I’ve been thinking about is how many disorders and mental illnesses have such similar symptoms. In addition, people with mental illness tend to have a couple diagnoses. 

It just has me thinking: I wonder if many mental disorders and illnesses are kind of one in the same, but on different parts of the spectrum and expressed differently??

Thoughts?"
283,feeling hopeless,"I've been dealing with a lot lately, I seem to disappoint everyone around me. No matter how hard I try to do good it just seems I mess everything up. Currently my grandma is currently pretty sick to and she's the person I live with and look up to. I feel like I'm at my breaking point, I've tried helping this feeling of hopelessness by going to counseling. But they never take me seriously. Im also losing all my good friends from a dumb decision I made. Any suggestions on what to do or how to get some hope in my life?"
284,How my therapist is teaching me to reclaim my inner world &amp; love myself,"Every therapy session I am told that I need to love myself. After hearing this for the millionth time, my therapist and I were able to nut out how to actually go about this.  


The following seven steps have started me on the process of self love - something that I am tremendously grateful for.  


**Step one**: Recognise how the past has led to my current behaviours and thought patterns.  
\- If I see the links from my past to now, I will know I am not fundamentally 'broken'.  
**Step two:** Acknowledge that I am human.  
\- Like everyone I make mistakes, and I am also capable of healing and growth.  
**Step three:** Be nice to my inner child (be my own parent).  
\- Give myself the things that I lacked growing up.  
**Step four:** Relax my high standards  
\- Stop holding myself to standards that I wouldn't hold others to (impossible standards).  
**Step five:** Stop comparing myself to others.  
\- I should only compare myself to myself. Personal growth is all that matters.  
    
**Step six:** Work on living in the present moment.  
\- Being mindful and present will help manage thoughts of the past/worry of the future.

**Step seven**: Forgive myself over and over again.  
\- For when I forget these lessons, for my mistakes and for everything that I would forgive others for as well.

286,Mental Health In The Work Place,"# Mental Health And The Work Place

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday thousands of people go to work, due their jobs to the best of their abilities and head home to their daily lives. Most people do not have to stop multiple times during their day to do a personal awareness check. Am I O.K? Am I doing my job correctly, and with efficiency? People with mental illness face inner challenges not seen by their peers or supervisors. It can be a very stressful life, getting up each morning hoping that the day will be a good one.

**I am one of the lucky ones.** I have an employer that is aware of my illness and takes steps to accommodate me when ever possible. I am in a profession that can be unsafe to work in if I am ill, by being either manic or depressed (Bipolar Disorder). I have explained to them what happens to me, and they do their very best to understand, and allow me the time off that I require when I am sick.

Workplaces can play an essential part in maintaining positive mental health. They can give people the opportunity to feel productive and be a strong contributor to employee well being. Yet in general it can also be a stressful environment that contributes to the rise of mental health problems and illnesses. No workplace is immune from these risks. Education on this subject is the best form of awareness. The giant wheel we call industry literally fathers our entire way of life. I find this fact impressive and amazing. Over many decades humans have crafted a society that affords all people the opportunity to participate and benefit through jobs and careers allowing them to enjoy the more important parts of life.

Unfortunately work can be so ingrained in our priorities that more often than not mental illness is overlooked, frowned upon or simply not accepted. Until recently I was guarded with my illness, but I would rather be up front with my peers when they ask why I missed work, or had to leave. There are also those who simply make unkind remarks or half hearted jokes. I have learned to be understanding with these people, as they simply have no experience with mental illness, and cannot understand why someone would miss work for reasons that they cannot physically see on the person who is ill.

There are many types of mental illnesses, and I can only speak personally about mine. I enjoy working and contributing as that is how I was raised, and how I raise my children. I developed bipolar disorder in my early twenties, and since then it has been a challenge to juggle this disorder and a career. I will however continue to do my very best to contribute gainfully as a member of society because that is what I deserve."
287,Need help/advice on a potential mental disorder.,"Been doing some soul searching lately and realized there might be more wrong with my head than I originally thought. Could use some help sorting it all out.

Sometimes when other people are going through something, I am there for them, but I’m not there with them. It feels like I only do what I’m doing to comfort them because I think it’s the right thing to do, and not because I actually care. That’s not saying I don’t feel empathy. I understand what they’re going through is hard, and I genuinely care about my friends and loved ones well being. I just can’t stop the thoughts that are like “I wish things were the way they were before this happened” or “I just want to get back to the show”. It makes me really upset with myself and guilty.

At the same time, I feel like I really read people well. I can always tell when someone is upset or if something is bothering them, and my first impressions of people are rarely disproven. When someone is down, I’m the first to ask them if they’re okay, and if they’re particularly upbeat, I ask them what’s up. I don’t know if that’s telling or anything, it’s just something I’ve noticed.

In high school I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and was also a self-proclaimed hopeless romantic. My therapist at the time stated that it seemed like I was only happy when I was in a relationship. I would find myself borderline obsessed with girls (not to the point of stalking or anything like that), like if I didn’t get their approval or get into a relationship with them I would get super depressed. I was in this friendship with a girl I claimed to be in love with for two years and the unreciprocation got to be so bad that I started feeling suicidal. Now that I’m in college and away from her it’s better, but I still hit really low lows and have a bad image of myself. That fixation has translated to other things too. Not nearly as bad, but I’ll find myself thinking something is super important and worth my time, and then within days completely forget or give up on it. My attention is really fleeting these days and I feel like my memory has gotten worse too.

I’ve also found myself to sometimes be a pretty angry person. It was worse when I was a kid, but I’ve learned to cope with it as I’ve grown up. It comes out every now and then though. I find myself getting frustrated really easily some days (although maybe that’s normal), but particularly with animals. I’ve never nor will I ever hurt one, but my gf and I were fostering this dog a while back who was really bad. She wouldn’t listen or learn and I would get really mad when my gf wasn’t around and yell at her. It’s not a side of me I’m proud of, and I hate when it comes out.

I feel like there’s something behind my behavior besides the aforementioned diagnoses, I just don’t know what. I originally went to therapy because I thought I might have bipolar disorder, since my cousin has it and I thought I had symptoms, but I left town before I could get a firm diagnosis. Even now I don’t have the money or time to find a professional therapist where I live, so I’m not sure what to do. Obviously there’s more to these stories but I was just hoping that someone might recognize some symptoms or something. Maybe I’m just thinking too much and watching too many videos about mental illness, but who knows."
288,I’m scared for myself and I can’t think straight,I was sleeping then I woke up around and hour after I got to sleep and had an urge to jump onto my neck and I was genuinely about to do it. I’ve not been able to sleep much though out this night. I’m just asking is anyone knows what’s wrong with me and if there is a way to help.
289,W need to go to a therapist but my mom won’t let me.,Oh and I’m 15. I need one but idk how to get one if my mom says no.
290,Addiction Relapse,"Hello again everyone. Today, I'm asking for some advice.

I've been having a rough time with the thought of relapsing. It's like one side of me craves drugs, but the other knows how bad it is for me and the people I care about. It causes a lot of cognitive dissonance and it's really getting to me.

Another thing in that sort of realm is one of the medicines I'm taking. I'm supposed to take 450 mg of Wellbutrin (Buproprion) a day. This caused a little bit of shakiness and general anxiety in me, so I continued at my typical 300 mg dose. However, I started going through a spell where I was so exhausted after even the slightest bit of exertion that I couldn't function. Since I knew Buproprion was my ""upper"" out of my medicine, I figured a bit more would help. I don't remember why, but I then though it would be a good idea to do 600 mg daily. This amount is damaging to my health. However, now I'm started to be taken over by thoughts of wanting more. I'm constantly shaking to some extent and am almost a ball of nerves, but then all I can think about is wanting more. I can't - I shouldn't but I have been known to take megadoses of medicines when I'm struggling (gave myself serotonin syndrome once), sort of like the drug binges of my past. I fear that I'm going to go through that again.

I don't want to relapse; I've been trying so hard to get better, but I'll be damned if I can ever get to a ""normal"" mindset again.

Advice? Comments? Any and all is welcome. Thank you so much."
291,"I think my ex might be either a narcissist or a sociopath or a psychopath, I seriously don't know, but that thought is driving me crazy and I need help figuring out what happened there. Trigger alert!!!!","For those who haven't seen my previous posts, I have a history with sexual assault. But my ex was the one who got furthest away... I'll tell in detail my particular story with him.

He's a guy who's studied tons of books on how to persuade people and how brain works, and at first I thought of it as a reality interesting thing as I find the human brain absolutely fascinating, it's an incredible organ. But that's not the point, the thing is that I think he used his knowledge to manipulate me into being in denial and not acknowledging what he actually did to me. On our third date we kissed for the first time and my Uber app did not work, so I couldn't get back home. It was already 2 in the morning and staying out in the street waiting for my app to respond so I could get a ride was not a good option. So as his ride was quite close, he said I could go to his place and order my ride from there, I didn't have going to his place in mind that night, but I was more scared of being on the street alone on my own than accepting his offer, then I told him I would only accept if he understood that me going to his place didn't mean we were going to have sex that night, he told me he was ok with that and that I shouldn't worry about it. So I accepted and we went to his place, my app was still unresponsive and he wouldn't offer me to use his instead and pay for it cash at my drop out point, no, he saw mine wasn't working and started kissing me, I kissed him back as I did like him. But then he started getting more sexually aggressive and suddenly, without any previous warning started trying to finger me (I was wearing a skirt), I said no and moved, he asked me if I didn't like it and I just replied I didn't want it to happen that night. He stopped for a few seconds and kept on trying and trying and trying and I kept on saying no, I was scared already by that point. Then I went to the bathroom hoping that would help his hormones go down a little bit and calm down, but then when I came out of the bathroom he was naked from his waist down, I was in shock, I asked him why did he do that and his answer was: weren't you curious? I mean now you won't be curious about it anymore... I was terrified, tried to ignore him and to make my app work again, but it didn't and he started kissing me again and trying to put my hand on his cock, I didn't want to touch it but I felt really intimidated, he pulled me to sit on his lap facing him and started kissing me, I responded to his kisses, but I was terrified, he started trying to finger me repeatedly again and I kept on rejecting his advances, until I decided the best thing I could do would be telling him I really didn't have any energy at all and just needed to sleep, to please let me sleep(I had no other choice, it was either staying there or risking other people on the street doing much worse to me, I live in a really dangerous city), and that seemed to have worked, but he said we should cuddle then (he slept, I couldn't sleep). The next morning I just wanted to go back home but he started trying again, kissing me and finger banging me, I didn't want to and said now a few times but then I just gave up, I was scared and feeling worn up, he kept on insisting until I eventually gave up and didn't put any resistance anymore. It really did hurt, he finger banged me and he was really rough and I told him it was rough and he said that was the way he was supposed to do it so I could find pleasure, I had to fake an orgasm, but I really only wanted it to stop and to go home, well then he pulled up a condom and proceeded to penetrate me, I again had to fake an orgasm so he'd let me go, then he came and stopped. I felt so uncomfortable! Well I took a shower and then when I got out he made breakfast for me. I told myself after leaving his place that maybe it was just an awkward sexual encounter and was in denial for a few months and kept on dating him. A few dates after that episode he told me about will power and timing on food and how people's will power wears down when they haven't eaten for more than X amount of hours and stuff, that has been echoing in my head a lot lately when I remember what happened that first time ""we had sex"" (actually my therapist told me it was rape, but sometimes I doubt myself when using that term, but I do feel raped indeed), he waited until I was too tired to fight him so I'd let him do it! He knew the will power theory and everything and still did what he did. Then during the 3 months I kept on dating him because I was still in denial, he would sometimes drop comments about women who claim being raped after having consensual sex and then regretting it and how sucky that was, how he hates those women because they had no credibility and how his dad was an amazing lawyer, he did try a few sexual things without asking me for my consent before doing them and when I told him it was the first time that happened to me he replied ""isn't that the point of it all?"", he would never listen to the things I told him I didn't like him to do to me and he'd constantly do them to me, one of them I told him several times too and he'd always say he'd stop doing it the day I don't laugh at it, but my laugh was involuntary and nervous and I tried explaining that to him, but he always ignored it saying it was a lie, that if I laughed was because I liked it and then try to turn things around by saying I didn't do a certain thing he wanted me to do, or that I was being unnappreciative of what he did for me and stuff (he always complained about him being an amazing friend, relative or son and people being unnappreciative and insensitive about it), when I didn't do exactly what he wanted when he wanted he would throw on tantrums acting like a f***ing child, pouty faces, manipulating me with not being affectionate and stuff like that... The last tantrum was like a week before he left this country and he tried to force unprotected sex on me, I was terrified, I thought he was going to violently rape me, he ignored my no's several times trying to penetrate me with no condom but I moved rejecting him and saying no repeatedly until he got mad at me and went to sleep really annoyed. He always insisted we keep in touch after he left because ""he thought he was be a person who could bring a lot of good things to my life and help me in many ways"" and as I was still in denial, I accepted. He kept on talking to me every day as if we were together, but we were not anymore, after some time I started feeling really uncomfortable about it, and thinking about what happened when he was here, and started feeling disgusted but guilty about not wanted to talk to him anymore, then started going to therapy and finally blocked him from everywhere. His response to that was sending me an SMS from another number asking me to tell him why did I bock him after ""everything he did for me"" and after being such an important part of each other's life, I was terrified and didn't want to tell him as I'm well aware he'd never say it to my face and recognize what he did (sexually assaulting me)... 

What do you think? Does he fit the profile for a narcissist, a sociopath? A psychopath? I don't know... Please help me understand!"
292,I need to talk to someone. (Dissociation),"I feel weird lately. Like everything I do is a simulation. That I'm not real. I'm not human. I don't know *why* I feel this way is the thing. Socially, I'm suspect of mild autism based on my traits, some of my family members have anxiety, and I may be depressed. Whatever I'm feeling I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Am I just going crazy?"
293,Bullied for years. It’s been one year since my suicide attempt. My depression is magically cured idk what happened,"My depression magically went away. I’m feeling emotions that I haven’t felt in years

I don’t even know how to start this. My name is kat, I just turned 19 and I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety at the age of 13. I tried killing myself on Valentine’s Day of 2019. I was over weight growing up and as a 5’11 female, people were never nice to me. I didn’t have a problem with how I looked, but others really did. I didn’t know my appearance was such a disgrace, until I got into high school. Freshman year I was so alone and bullied to the point where I stopped eating and developed anorexia. I dropped 50 pounds in the matter of 3 months. The school didn’t do anything and I ended up transferring. It got worse at the school I transferred to. I would get harassed by the football players and groped or called horrible names by them. It was like a really bad toxic relationship that I was battling. Except it was with the whole football team and anybody else who had an opinion about me. Everyday I would hide in my sweat pants and baggy sweaters. I wanted to be hidden so bad. I hated dressing up or looking too “put together” because I didn’t want people to notice my outfit and then notice all the flaws that came with me as a person. I wasn’t diagnosed but I feel as if I had really bad body dysmorphia. Everything I did revolved around how I looked. I would spend 2 hours every morning on my makeup , and if something was off about it — I wouldn’t go to school. Or I would get extremely PHYSICALLY sick to my stomach and not be able to leave the house. If I did have the confidence to go to school, I would leave mid day. I missed about 48% of my high school experience (according to my 4 year attendance card). I was hardly ever at school. Growing up I was always into modeling, music, dance and any type of art. I was a friendly introvert. I always saw the best in people and never judged anybody by how they looked because I was always the “underdog” too. So I was nice to everyone but I was shy at first. The ball happened to roll into my court and I started to get recognized online for my “beauty”. I gained thousands and thousands of followers on Instagram and yet I still wasn’t happy with how I looked and I still felt so horrible about myself. I was tormented- bullied- and posted about online for the full 4 years, until I graduated. Sounds like a horrible high school sitcom but people boo’d at me as I walked my graduating stage. There was actually a hate page (that is still up to this day) with over 70k followers. This page strictly posts vile and horrible things about me and people follow it for amusement. I guess to summarize and make it short. 

I hated myself. I wanted to die. Everyday. I fucking hated life. Every little fucking thing about life. I looked in the mirror and wanted to fucking off myself. Every. Fucking. Day. I couldn’t stand seeing my reflection. I was bullied so fucking bad that I got so numb and started believing everything that was being said to me. I was such a pure fucking person and people ruined that. And I hate everyday that I gave people the power to fuck with my life like that. 

I hated seeing others smile. I didn’t understand why others got sad after a heart break. I didn’t understand why people got happy when they got a raise. I would get so envious and irritated at laughter because I didn’t understand why others were able to feel that way— when I couldn’t. It sounds harsh, I know. Luckily I never portrayed these feelings outwardly, but my mind is so fucking dark. 

But fast forward. 

It’s 02/15. A year and a day since my suicide attempt. And I feel like my life literally changed in a day. Like some weird universe shit. Like as if I had to complete a full year of tragedy and loneliness, in order to feel emotions again. Not even trying to be corny, but I feel happy again. And it’s really hard to explain, if you’ve never felt the depression “numbness” before. But it’s like you’re stuck on autopilot. And you’re just a bystander to your own life. I didn’t feel that this morning and I feel like everything that I felt in my past was so irrational and all the things people have done to me, doesn’t matter anymore. I have tried to get to this train of thought for YEARS. I’ve tried everything. Drugs, exercise, laughter, sex— nothing ever worked. I was still numb and felt like I was living in some type of simulation. And now all of a sudden, I wake up and now I’m seeing life for what it is? I’m excited. I’m so grateful for every little thing now. And I guess idk why I wrote this whole thing .. I just needed answers or maybe somebody who could relate to me?  Idk who to talk to about this feeling because I don’t know if anybody would ever understand or if it even makes sense. Sometimes I just feel like I’m this extraterrestrial being, that nobody can relate to because I feel like I process things differently. 

So if you’re reading this and have input— please leave it. This is my first post. I might not ever post again but I need to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading."
294,It feels like I am losing grip on reality,I am going insane. I can’t even close me eyes for more than a few seconds because of the memories and triggers. I am so ready to give up. I just want to run away from everything and everyone. I keep spiralling downwards. I just don’t even care about trying anymore. I just want to escape.
295,I’m tired of nothing feeling real half the time,"Everything in my life feels like it isn’t real and not in the “Oh my god this is amazing there’s no way this is real” way, it just feels empty. One thing that I always loved was the rain cause no matter what it felt like it was real, it was full of something, it existed, it mattered. I mean somethings feel real most of the time like my current relationship but some days even that doesn’t feel real. Everything just feels empty, nonexistent, fake, and like it just doesn’t matter. I don’t know how to handle so I’m gonna just bring it up to my therapist. If you read this thanks for listening to me venting not many people do."
296,Weird predicament,"Hi guys. Recently I've not been doing alright. I've been thinking about talking to a professional but I almost feel it's a bit overkill.

I just don't seem to have any strong feelings about anything at the moment, I sort of feel blank. Anything I care about happens in the summer. I know it's probably a bad case of S.A.D but I'm just sort of... bored of everything. 

I'm in an alright spot in life right now; I'm meant to be at uni but I just can't get the energy to drag myself out of bed. I feel like I can easily learn my course (computer related) online using the uni resources and Google.

I've been meaning to get out to go to the gym but every time I make dumb excuses like 'my shorts aren't clean enough' and 'it's too windy outside'

Any hobbies I have I get bored of/lose focus after an hour or so and all I really feel like doing is playing games.

It's a lot to decode but wtf can i do.."
297,Random bursts of extreme energy?,"Sometimes I have so much energy in me I feel like I need to run around the block 100 times. I feel like I could jump out of my skin. I’ll just randomly get it and I have to do something stupid to “get the energy out” lol it’s so weird. My boyfriend knows when it’s happening and just tells me to get it all out and I’ll shake my legs like crazy or something. 

I can have whole days like this maybe even a week. I don’t get super depressed so I don’t think I’d be bi polar but I do get in blahh boring moods. I’m generally a happy person although I have pretty bad anxiety. 

I’m confused at myself honestly. Idk what’s up with me."
298,Teetering between neutral and sad,"My brain has the tendency to exaggerate the overall negativity of a certain situation and always moves towards how horribly anything can go as opposed to how it can end positively.

It's been like this for several years. I switch between two moods. Its either I think so highly of myself (to the point where people find me arrogant) or I think of myself as trash. I've been prescribed pills once by my therapist at my country's mental institution, fluvoxamine, if I recall correctly. I never took the pills because the general opinion towards the idea was negative. My mother was convinced me I didnt need them and so I threw them away. Now I'm beginning it question if I should've done what the doctor told me to.

I'm 23. I'm on my first year of university and I hate that. I know I should be grateful that I even have the opportunity to get a degree but I'm still sad that i didn't get to go overseas like all my friends have and I know that I shouldn't have this mindset because comparison is the death of joy. 

I was born into a religion I never truly believed in and that has constantly been the source of contention between me and my very pious mother who currently hates me because I confessed to my lack of faith. To make the situation worse, she despises my current girlfriend because of her faith, race and what she did to me once 4 years ago (which was leaving me in the 2nd week of my mandatory national service amidst my parent's legitimate divorce and dire financial straits).

That aside, I was always able to keep my head on straight (mostly) but what has pushed me to the edge was the suicide of my closest friend on the 3rd of October. She was the only person in the world who I'd truly take a bullet for. On that day, at 11.51PM she called me to let me know that she loved me and gave me an address. Upon arrival, all I found was her corpse. 

This seems like it's all over the place but I just want to know if I'm depressed, do I have a problem, do I have a right to be sad? 

I'm in no way craving death but I really dont mind it and sometimes i even fancy the idea. I have constant dreams and daydreams about the different ways I do myself in and as the days pass I'm beginning to think to myself, ""maybe my friend had the right idea.""

In the past few years, it just feels like I'm not doing anything right. I'm insecure, I'm furious and I feel alone. Should I seek professional help?"
299,"I take every single thing I've been told in therapy seriously, and I don't know how to disregard what therapists say. When I get conflicting advice in therapy from what I learned in therapy years ago, I can't process it.","FWIW, I've been told I have a very rigid thought process and have been diagnosed with Asperger's as a child (though it was never addressed and the diagnosis has since been dismissed numerous times). I also do not know how to form my own views and opinions based on things I'm told and things I read - everything is taken in its entirety or completely dismissed. None of my therapists have seen this as an issue and therefore I have nowhere to turn for help with it.

I've been in DBT, a residential treatment center, intensive outpatient, AA, and outpatient therapy. Because I've dealt with abusive family members completely dismissing anything a therapist told them that they didn't like, I feel like I have to take everything seriously, otherwise I'm wasting both of our time and not willing to get better. Unfortunately, I don't filter ANYTHING and that means I have to process what I heard in therapy for MONTHS. Whenever I attempt balancing what I've learned in multiple places, it doesn't work because I'm still giving ideas value that I probably should drop. 

DBT says that volunteering is a way to build positive experiences and self-image. Intensive outpatient said volunteering is a form of narcissism because we do it to feel good about ourselves, and is therefore not healthy.

Residential treatment taught me that participation by listening is a healthy boundary when you're too tired or not in a good mood. Intensive outpatient says this is selfish and if you're choosing to be in group therapy, your peers are entitled to your feedback. Outpatient therapist says some things aren't even worthy of a response in the first place.

DBT taught me how to get my needs met by setting boundaries, since most relationships with people we have issues with need to stay in our lives (bosses, parents). Residential taught me that no, you actually don't need to have those people in your life - quitting your job and cutting off your parents IS an acceptable boundary. Intensive outpatient took it a step further and said that if you don't do this, you're choosing to stay stuck.

Residential and DBT talked about how it's okay to slip up, acknowledge what you did wrong, forgive yourself, and move forward. AA equated self-forgiveness with a lack of accountability - if you slip up once, you're back at square 1.

My IOP facility in particular set me back several notches - I had only just gained a shred of self esteem at residential when a therapist (note: not MY therapist) told me I had antisocial personality disorder in group therapy and lead a psychoeducation group on how to get your needs met by ""a person like me."" I do feel like some of it was helpful, though. I wound up asking my friends if they thought I was selfish and every single one said I was either selfish or inconsiderate. Since I went there, my relationships and friendships are 10x better - but I don't know how to let go of the toxic shit I was fed there without also letting go of what's helpful. 

How much am I allowed to disagree with what I'm told before I'm not willing to get better?"
300,I’ve been thinking of killing myself. Should I do it?,
301,I think I’m losing my memories,"I think I spend a good chunk of my day accidentally thinking about embarrassing or upsetting moments, so I’ve coped by imagining me crumpling up the memory and throwing it away or shoving the memory into the deepest parts of my brain. Placebo or not I believe it works and I tend to not think about it for a while or forever but in that process I feel like I’m losing memories of good ones or even every single moment I had with someone I don’t talk to anymore. I ended a relationship and a friendship in the past year and I’ve almost completely erased every single memory I have of them. I know we knew each other but otherwise I can hardly remember anything. I know I’ll never stop coping by “erasing” my bad memories or feelings but I’m afraid I might lose more important memories I have. For now I’m thinking of just getting a diary to write important and meaningful memories into in case I forget those too. But otherwise, I’m not too sure. I’m afraid of the thought of possibly losing memories but I’m also not keen on trying to remember the memories I did want to erase..."
302,Is there any way to stop self-sabotage from happening?,"Hey all. I'm a 20y M. At 15 I was diagnosed with MDD with psychosis. Stopped getting help till last year when I became very volatile. Bla bla doctor now says Bipolar and TLE. 

I have sudden changes in mood often, which to my understanding isn't how Bipolar works. But recently (few months) I've been doing this thing where I'll sabotage the good things in my life so that committing suicide will be easier. I've broken up harshly with my gf, burned my arms to make them uglier, threw away things that were expensive. Every time after I regret it so much because of how dumb it is. Is there any way to fix this? 

I can't go to the psychiatrist. They've already had me in the hospital twice last year, and I can't afford another visit

(Btw meds are Epitec, Cymgen, Arizofy, Zolphidem, Dormonoct and Ritalin)"
303,You are FUCKING amazing,"Even when you think you dont matter, you do matter! You being alive today, reading this message, have made it through another day and I say Good. Fucking. JOB. If you still feel like shit, that's okay, you are allowed to feel whatever you want but just know YOU CAN DO THIS. This world is fucking tough by default but know that you are doing your best and your best is still really fucking cool. 

Bless you all. 

Just remember when u feel at your lowest, keep thinking about what keeps you going and focus on that no matter how small you think it matters. Because its strong enough to keep you alive and that's great.

I've been stuck in a very dark hole for so long and I now feel like I can see the surface finally. it feels like a huge lock has been put on my soul for the whole 22 years of my life so far and I feel so light and free. 

You can do this. I want you to be able to do this. Believe It. And if u cant,
""BELIEVE IN THE ME THAT BELIEVES IN YOU"" (sorry I'm a weeb and if u get this, u are great xD)"
304,I really need some advice on my mental condition.,"I found an article today on major depressive disorders and have found that I fit with all of the symptoms. I've been treated for depression in the past but I've been very neglectful in giving all the details of what I'm thinking (suicide, lack of sleep, appetite loss). It's just come to a place in my life where it's affecting me too much and I don't know if I should seek out professional help again. I just want to stop lying to myself about what's actually going on."
305,My roommate and best friend told me what it's like to be admitted to our hospital's mental health ward today,"Despite coming close to ending my life twice in the past, I was never admitted to the ward. I was kept in a room just off the ER. It was just a waiting room. I didn't realize that I was lucky they didn't want to keep me there, until I heard about what it's like on the ward.

My best friend admitted themselves after a particularly hard week about two months ago. They also have bpd so everything is just intensified. 

We were watching Horse Girl and I commented on how the mental health ward looked in the movie. They said they wished they got to stay in a room half as nice when they were admitted. They told me the rooms were cells. No windows. Dark. Doors locked from the outside. Yelling and strange noises could be heard in the hallway. No one seemed to care much. 

How can an environment like that help mental health? it only makes it worse. It makes it so you lie to your counsellors and nurses so you can get the hell out of there. I'm really angry and surprised at how fragile, broken people are treated like prisoners. How is this okay? Our hospital boasted about how great the mental health ward was when it first opened. It's a joke and part of the reason no one wants to find proper help."
306,Need Help!,Hi
307,I feel like multiple people,"I don’t know how to describe it... there are so many things I like, wanna do, wanna be seen as. That are just so polar opposite... I want to bee seen as a tough, strong, outdoor, working man but also a skinny, femmine man, who needs cuddles and is sensitive... I don’t it’s werd. I feel like I cat be everything and I feel like there is a physical switch that happens... That’s just a few of the ways I want to/feel like I’m seen. There’s tons of them and it’s all depending nothing it seems like.. I’ll just “switch” and if I’m talking to someone I’ll go quiet, seem distant, etc, or I’ll be hyper, talkative, excited. I’m also having trouble getting motivated to do anything. I want to but I just can’t make myself. It’s so hard to even get out of bed. I’ve been staying up till 4:39-5:00am and sleeping till 3pm... I don’t know it’s all so hard to explain. I’ve also had issues with self harm, suicidal thoughts, etc. I have high ups and low downs... I don’t know. Could this be something like bpd or bipolar? I know it wouldn’t be diagnosable through a Reddit post just wondering what it sounds like to you guys."
308,I have a bad habit of isolating myself,"Ever since high school I've always kept to myself and never really went out of my way to really talk to anyone I wasn't already friends with.  If I'm walking in someone's direction I'll stare right through them like they aren't there.

After graduating, it continued to get worse.  I stopped checking social media and hardly ever touched my phone.  Acceptance from others isn't my problem, I'm generally a likeable guy.  I just don't really.. care. About anyone or anything.

I got married to a girl I'd been with since middle school, and I assumed I had all I needed.  After some months she said she hasn't really liked me for a while and just kind of split.

That's when things got exponentially worse.  I've changed my number countless times just so no one would have it, but my mother keeps giving it out.  I've started ghosting family, and I can see how much it concerns them, but I don't have it in me to care.  I don't know where it comes from.

Recently I put a post on Reddit and it hit r/all , I had fun talking to people for a while and even met a really cute girl and some awesome people online.  But I can *feel* another isolation episode coming. I know it's only a matter of time before I delete whatever social media I have and change my number.

  I go weeks without seeing family and literal years without speaking to snyone else.  I'm content with only seeing people at my job and they love me, and honeslty that's all I need.

I wouldn't know what this would be considered.  I was diagnosed bipolar as a child, but I haven't been evaluated since.  I'm not a harm to anyone or myself, my apathy just won't let me care about other people I guess.

Does anyone else have this problem?"
309,I self harmed for the first time in over a year,
310,I met a person online who needs professional help,"This week, I met a person online who needs professional help for their mental state. Yesterday, they told me deeply personal issues that they have and essentially poured their heart out to me. It was to the pint where I had to drop everything I was doing to stay with them and get them to a good mental state. It caused me great distress, and they had caused me to stay up much later than I was comfortable with even after I mentioned that I needed to sleep multiple times.

I won't share exactly what they said on here, as their issues aren't for me to share. What I will say is that I told them I could help them get professional help and that I am not a professional. They declined. Today, something similar happened, and again I had to drop what I was doing. Yet again, I had to stay up incredibly later just to help this person get to a mentally better place, all the while they would not seem professional help even when I asked them to. Keep in mind, I haven't known this person for a full week yet. I want to help, but at the same time, I know this isn't something I am qualified or able to do. I can't keep staying up every night in distress trying to help them, it's just not something I am able to do right now. 

Tomorrow I'm going to explain to them that I can't continue doing this, and then offer them resources that can help them cope with their issues. How should I go about this? What resources should I offer? I need to make it clear that I cannot be their only mental support, and that what we've been doing the past two nights is something I cannot do anymore. I feel selfish saying this, but I also would rather not talk to this person after tomorrow due to the past two nights. How do I do this?"
311,I self harmed for the first time in years,"There was a miscommunication between me and my boyfriend during sex, which was primarily my fault, and he is now self conscious about his sexual ability and is anxious about having sex. I felt so fucking terrible for making him feel like that. When I got home from his house, I couldn’t find a razor, so I took my nail and scraped my thigh until I saw blood and bruising. I repeatedly hit my forearm until my shoulder began cramping, and since I don’t see bruising I am continuing to do it. I feel so horrible. I deserve this. He’s the only good person in my life right now and I hurt him."
312,Should I quit alcohol altogether?,"Every time I have even the slightest bad experience at a bar or club it already takes everything in me to not flip out and attack someone. But when I get home I usually start breaking stuff and for example I took one of my knives and slashed up my nightstand, it’s in such bad condition by now it could never sell to anyone. I’m just such a mental mess right now. I got super pissed when I got rejected by these 2 women and idk how to not let rejection bother me. All I did was ask if they wanted to dance and they said they were in line for drinks but then a couple moments later I see them talking to this fat fuck and some other average looking guy. Like what am I supposed to do go to jail for assaulting one of these motherfuckers to prove a point?"
313,Accidentally supportive,"I was writing an essay for an upcoming project I'm working on. It involves some of my trauma. When I was writing about the trauma, google docs suggested I change a word to past tense. I don't know why that felt so good to see."
314,Help Listen,"I’m having a bad breakdown tonight and I haven’t had one in a long time. I’m scared that my schizoaffective disorder is coming back... I can’t afford my medication anymore and I thought it was gone! The words are repeating over and over and the radio won’t turn off. My family hates me.. they love me but when I’m not normal they are so mean to me. I’m keeping my suicidal voices to myself because of this, I mean I’ve been bedridden for a week now because of constant seizures and they’re so mad that I can’t do housework and I’m mad at myself because I’m worthless and pathetic. I can’t even get a job! I can’t make money to help my family... and now it’s happening again and I’m so scared. I am having trouble seeing and my mirror is disgusting to look into. I can’t drive... I can’t think straight right now I’m sorry if you’re reading this please don’t mind me it just helps me to post my thoughts into the public but I never hope for someone to see it. It’s embarrassing. I haven’t had friends since I was seven and I’m twenty-two now... I don’t deserve friends. Talking is so scary and hard. I just want to help people smile and feel happy despite how scary things can be but I can’t. I haven’t even lived yet because my life was stolen since I became mental at eight years old. I need medical treatment because my health is going downhill and my seizures are getting worse but Medicaid nor Medicare will take me since I’m not disabled. I’m sorry for complaining I’m just scared and no one wants me. I don’t want to hurt myself or put my hand in a toaster anymore. I don’t want to see the disappointment on my parent’s face when I say I need to be put in a hospital for my suicidal thoughts... and then they say they can’t take me there anyways because of money and it wouldn’t help anyways and I’m just exaggerating. I wish they didn’t leave the blades out. I still love them so much, they mean the world to me but they don’t understand and I don’t blame them. I want to live life one day... but my brain is going to end me. I’m sorry if someone read this... if someone is here, I want you to know that you’re worthwhile. That you’re amazing and beautiful and the world is lucky to have you. You’re the only you out there and we’re glad to have you here. You’re loved and special. Thank you. I will delete later when my episode ends."
315,I feel lost.,"I hate myself for not being happy. There is not a single thing in my life that could be better. I have a loving family, good friends and I'm in love with the person who feels the same way for me. But I'm not happy. I lack motivation to do anything, I can't concentrate on my studies and I'm in general very tired. I want to do great and I know I have the means to do so but I just can't help myself. What can I do? Please tll me anything that I can try?"
316,My last year,"(sorry if I write badly, I'm from Argentina and I'm learning). I am 18 years old and this year I suffered from depression and anxiety. I was far from almost all the people I know, although sometimes I left my house to join someone, mostly as a necessity imposed by myself. I know that sometimes I have to see and talk to people, although I love being alone and I always enjoy it. but in a moment things got worse. my mother once in response to my concern about becoming ""crazy"" (I was smoking a lot of weed and at some point I couldn't stop thinking, my thoughts became loud and unbearable, to the point that I thought I could become schizophrenic) he told me ""If you think too much about going crazy, you will become one."" That phrase, that phrase stuck in my head. I had stopped reading books (a true passion, especially dostoevsky) and, in general, I stopped enjoying anything. My anxiety reached the point of not seeing a future. Even if the world right now feels increasingly dead, I still want to experience and live the last moments. The problem is that this possibility did not exist for me, since the problem was internal and had no solution. For those who think, why didn't you go to therapy? My family barely has any money, and with inflation in my country, prices rose very high. As you may know, in a few countries mental health is taken seriously. continuous. At this point I am almost certain that I am schizophrenic since there is no obvious distinction between thoughts and voices, because in reality there is no such distinction. (Among all this, I also thought it was bipolar. And I know that it is silly to analyze and give these answers without any psychiatrist involved, but understand the anxiety and fear that was happening). It seems as if your thoughts turn against you, especially with anxiety attacks. Over time the only solution I found, after realizing that I didn't want to talk to my friends and I didn't want to see anyone I know, partly because even before the problem I didn't consider them as friends and sincerely preferred to be alone, it was going out from my house. You don't need to look for friends because you need help and you feel lonely, you have to experience a little more simple things and stop thinking constantly about yourself, because that way you will live asking yourself the same questions that have no way out. The only way to achieve this is to leave your home, you have to run and eat well. Reading is very important, because it is a great way to calm anxiety, and like music is something that anyone can be entertain.it is important that Culture enters our life. and believe me that I know how much it costs to leave home, at least I was lucky enough to know since I was little what my passion is and the only thing that saved me during the journey, the only thing that made me leave again.


 In time I calmed down, since I discovered that the solution was to give myself to the only things that I was passionate about, books, photography, and especially cinema. I will improve partly because I read again and because I started working on short films filming the streets of my neighborhood and taking pictures. I also go to film festivals and im constantly meeting new people in the streets. The anxiety diminished and with the help of people I could at least calm all these thoughts and the paranoia in which I constantly lived. All this puts you to think about the dangers of this loop, and the fear of how much one can dissapear from reality in dark times."

322,Getting to the root.,"It would take way more than a reddit post to explain everything, so I'll leave as much as I can out.

I have worked since 15 at many jobs, never lasting more than a couple months. I start off optimistic, but eventually snowball into no-showing. I'm 18 now, and just quit my job. I liked it. Had an amazing boss, good coworkers, and it was the best pay I could get out of HS. No real reason for me to quit. On my way to work, I was hoping a car would hit me so I wouldn't have to go to work.

I've done this at a lot of jobs now, and I have been trying to figure it out. Context (I'll try to keep it short) : I spent Elementary school between schools and short/long term care facilities. I had violent outbursts almost every day. Tried a couple meds, had bad side effects. Eventually I think general aging and realizing the path I was heading down made me slowly calm down. If I told you about what I did as a kid in person you'd think I'm lying, as I'm the most reserved, shy, awkward guy ever. 

I still struggle with... Something. Anxiety, stress, depression. Is it one thing that causes the others? A little bit of all of them? If I had to guess my anxiety is the worst - runs in my dad's side, and schizophrenia in my mom's, great. The depression kicks in harder than the anxiety when I am alone with time to think. So I can't relax. I always have to be doing something, as downtime leads to bad thoughts. 

Back to the point. I think my anxiety is the worst and the cause of the other stuff. I think as a kid, I interpreted it as fear. Thus the outbursts. But what the hell can I do to work on it? I can't afford therapy - especially not without a job now - and I don't see my doctor until May. It's a new doctor, so I doubt they'd want to put me on meds after first meet. they'd probably want me to see a therapist because what, do I need antidepressants? Anti anxiety?

It fucking sucks. I'm always anxious about something. And I'm just terribly socially as well. Can't make eye contact. Can't hold a conversation. Definitely can't start a conversation. One of the only things keeping me going is a drive to want a relationship. But that's hard with no friends, and never messaging anyone first on apps. Oh, on that note, friends as well. What the fuck are they and how do they work. I never had one through school, everyone had their own cliques. I can't hold a job so coworkers can't really be ""friends"". So how? Meetup.com? That would never go over well for me. 

I know I would never commit suicide - I'm far too logical and know the negatives always outweigh the benefits. But if I didn't think that way, I might have tried by now. I'm always going to be struggling. All my energy will be to counter my anxiety, holding conversations, and figuring out what thoughts of mine are anxiety and what ones are mine. But god I just want to know why, regardless of if I can change it, I'm like this and what it is. Just really bad anxiety? I have no clue and I hate that I don't."
323,I always say I'm fine even when I'm not,I dont like to share my emotions and I never really have with family or friends. And I've been trying to change this recently but I'm finding it impossible to do.
324,Mental Health poem,"Mental health Suicide poem

I sit by the river and look to the sky,
imagining the feeling and asking myself why.

What gives you the strength to end it all,
when did you life hit the metal wall.

Our eyes are the window to our soul,
were yours clouded like a deep misty hole.

Why did the system let you so badly down,
depression is not just a temporary frown.

Imagine a time that we can talk  to one another,
whether its a doctor, child or your a brother.

Tears would be shed and a problem halved,
a memory in your heart would be calved.

Too many life's are being destroyed,
families torn apart and left with a void.

If we can learn from you in any way,
to help the thoughts float away.

I don't know your name or who you belong,
but the Mental health system has got it so wrong.

It effects  many families so far and wide,
lets come together and diminish suicide.

Nicola"
325,I feel wrong,"I'm going to the psychologist tomorrow for another session and oh boy, am confused af. I wanna tell her everything, that I don't wanna talk to my parents etc. but whenever the time comes I feel like different person and can't tell anything. I just feel obligated to the things she says and it's not like she pushes it on me, it's my damn brain that's doing it and I can do shit about it"
326,I think I have BDD (body dysmorphic disorder) and idk what to do,"I'm 17 and Currently take Zoloft for my depression, I've been spiraling out of control mentally and trying so hard to accept myself physically, it's just that when I look at myself my face my eyes are uneven, my nose is huge, my lips are misplaced and my face has pores the size of golf balls. I know I'm over exaggerating my dislikes and it isn't healthy but I genuinely can't stop thinking about it, Everytime I take a picture of myself I end up in a crying fit over my face. I'm not sure if this could be the cause of my depression and am considering therapy. Any advice?"
327,I don't feel like I can trust my therapist anymore..,"Hi,

 It's my fist post and it's kinda long..apologies in advance.

So I've been with my therapist for 4 yrs now and for the most part she's been really great. She helped me a lot especially when I had extreme suicidal thoughts and when I was self harming..

I must say sometimes it felt like she didn't know exactly what to do with me when I was in those situations but she did her out most best, always worried about me..

She told me during those 4 yrs that **I don't have depression**. That my life has just been objectively hard and that with enough hard work and change of environment I can move on and have a balanced life.

For a while I tried to believe that. But no matter how I looked at it trough the years I thought **she is terribly mistaken**.

I went through a rough life..I won't elaborate too much but the first time I wanted to cease to exist I was in the third grade. I cried almost everyday since I can remember myself.. At first at reasonable things like bulling or being hit at home or just being lonely (started at first to second grade)..But then I started to cry just for being alive when I didn't want to.. 

I read a lot. Not just on the internet, mainly books.

Anything from self help to psychology (not the popular but the academic ones) to poetry to novels.. I even watch a lot of Ted talks about depression and suicidal thoughts and anxiety, all to find every time how much I relate to these topics in my daily life.

It was a form of extra self therapy I did with myself. Always looking for new ways to get better and see what others in similar circumstances did to better themselves.

I charted daily activities to track habits and feelings, got apps for mental health and self betterment and I even had it for a while..some sort of balance..I meditated and exercised and ate healthy and got off addictive generic ssri pills (that were given to me by a sketchy doctor) that didn't help me and brought me nothing but nasty side effects.. all to be a functional adult..I really tried!

I'm  in college now..And ever since I'm there I fell to a stronger never ending depressive episode ..lost all of my good habits bit by bit.. my thoughts escalated .Even though ""on paper"" everything is fine, two weeks ago I started a draft of a plan of sorts, of the things I'll need to do before I go.

I told my therapist ( she's a psychologist) after months of terrible mood not changing and she told me to meet her more often.

I can't quite afford the treatment. and I pay the same (relatively low) price over the 4 yrs which stayed constant (after a while they're supposed to rise it periodically in my country) and in really bad times she would see me for an even lower price or for free. (which even though somewhat helpful, it made me feel extremely uncomfortable in these conditions). 

She also told me to see a psychiatrist to start medical treatment (more pills) but here's the thing!

**She doesn't believe me to have depression!** 

So, wait, I don't have a mental illness!? I'm not sick!? 

How the hell can that be when I've been struggling with this my entire life?! 

Let's see.. low energy on a daily basis? check! terribly sad moods that continue for more the two weeks in arow? check! 

feeling hopelessness on a daily? check!

 sleeping too much or too little? check! 

feeling uneasy with people around me? feeling like a burden? like the world is better off without me? that I'm never good enough? avoiding people around me? talking of mortality? frequent crying? not wanting to leave the house? daily tasks come at great difficultly or at times I'm unable to do them at all because I'm too sad or stressed to even watch TV let alone leave my bed ?? self harm? feeling like I want to die (or more accurately I don't want to live)?!?! check and check!

She knows all of this of course and yet claims that though I may not have depression, I have a tendency for depressive behavior in my personality or some thing like that

Oh.... excuse me, I guess I don't have depression I guess I just suck as a person?!

I don't know how to take this info or how to process that at all..

She says I cannot be defined as having depression because I am able to somewhat function and go to work (I'm not stupid I need the money even though it takes a terrible emotional toll) and that I still have my survival instinct about me in when push gets to shove (well, knowing hunger and abuse will do that to you) or something among the lines of ""you're too strong and stable to be considered sick"" ....But my strength is weaning! I don't know how long I'll be able to hold it.

She claims that there has been an escalation (no shit) and I may need the pills even though I'm not really sick. ""It's just something to help me cope until I get back on my feet"".

For me there is no getting beck.. I almost had it in my grasp! a balanced life friends..my dream job!

all gone to an illness I don't have that I still need to be medicated for!

quick disclosure- mental illness runs in my family! from my grandma to My mom who is popping meds like cereal! 

I don't want to be medicated if I'm not sick and to have addiction to drugs that don't help and make me fat for no reason!

Plus, if I am sick, I need a name for the daemon  I've been struggling with! Isn't that how exorcism works? I'm not religious but they really had a point there! Name the problem so you can know how treat it no?

I have been fighting with her over this for a month now and It's going nowhere.. No matter what she says to rationalize her claims..I can't hear her. It's like everything she says looses context..I challenged her as a person and as a professional..still she wants to help..I don't get it..

This just feels like a betrayal for some reason..and the feeling is strong and bitter..If I had anyone to help me find the way to balance then, it's gone now and even though she stretches out a hand I don't want to take it.."
328,Need help getting my sibling on public assistance,"How can I (F, 40) help my brother (M, 42) get on public assistance?  He has been diagnosed with pure O, a form of OCD. It's severe and he hasn't been able to work in years. My aging parents (70s) are paying his rent to keep him off the streets but they won't be around forever.  He refuses to see a psychologist and says he would sooner go back to being homeless than accept disability benefits or go back on the anti-psychotic meds.   Is there any way for me to get him on public assistance like housing and food stamps?"
329,Trauma/Stress after being stuck in a potential fire,"I live in a building of 9 floors and live on the 6th floor

A few weeks ago, i heard a fire alarm. There are only detectors in people's apartments.  
It usually happens when people are cooking and burn something and forget to open their windows  
But normally it stops after a few seconds, max 15-30 seconds  
This time, it was going on for more than 2 minutes  
I looked outside the window and down, i saw smoke coming out of an apartment on the 4th floor  
I started panicking because i thought of this situation a few days ago, i don't know why  
I put on my shoes and went in the hall and stairs and smelt burnt   
So i thought i can't use the elevator because it's non recommended during a fire and i didn't want to take the stairs in case there were dangerous smokes.  
So i really started to panic   
Anyway to be sure, i called firefighter line and explained the situation.  
They advised me to go downstairs and check and knock on the neighbors. There was just burnt smells but not smokes so they said it was ok.  
So i went downstairs and knocked at the door, the neighbor opened and yeah it was only burnt bread.  
After that, i had to lie down 2-3 hours on my bed to calm down and i thought of it a little days after.  
Then i stopped thinking of it until today. 

Why am I telling this story ? Because 2 weeks ago, i was stuck in the traffic and i started to panic. I don't like to be stuck somewhere on in a situation where i cannot extract myself easily. But this time it was real hard time. I had to pullover once and then on the motorway, i really had the feeling i would faint and have an accident. And last week, i started having chest pain just where the heart is and also 2 nights where i felt like i was choking and could not breathe. I even went twice to the emergency, once sent by my doctor for a check up. And everything from a « physical » view is ok.  
The choke feeling last days seems to come only when i'm resting or alone not talking to someone. But when i'm busy out of home or with people, i don't think of it. And i think it grows when i'm home  
I only understood today that maybe this is post traumatic stress after the supposedly ""fire"" incident

  
My doctor has put me on medications and gave me names of comportemental psychotherapists but I won’t have an appointements before weeks probably

Has anyone been like this kind of situation/« PTSD » ? How did you live this ? What are the advices you got ?  
We plan to move in a different city, in a house (it was planned before the incident) in may but i'm thinking : is it a good option to leave this place earlier because it would be good to go out of this ""toxic"" zone where i experienced the stress/trauma ?

Thank you"
330,Cant stop hitting myself?,"So everyday no matter if i am in class or at home I have these moments where my legs start fidgeting, I get really hot and I just feel super uncomfortable. Like I have so much energy in me and I dont now that to do with it. I start getting like some kind of ticks and cant sit still. Like my legs start shaking and my whole body cant stop moving. I usually start hitting my forehead with my knuckles or slap the back of my head or other parts of my body. Like I want to leave my body and I want to die. I start to think about everything and the more i think the worse it gets. It has gotten to the point where my forehead is starting to really hurt and swell up. Does anyone know how this can stop?"
331,Can someone help me,
332,i dont want to go on. how?,"ill try to make it short, both of my parents passed away in the last two years. my girlfriend which was the only person I opened up to, left me. im an alcoholic and pothead, I love making music and lost the job I'm educated in, because my company went bankrupt. it was a really well paid job but it just doesn't work for me, and right now im in a condition where im not able to attend reliably on a job daily. so im happy that I am unemployed but I feel like living on the costs of people who pay taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I became a very bitter person,  I really want to get help, but I just feel like 99% of the therapists have no clue, or have very conservative views on things .. in Germany you can try out 5 therapists before you choose one, and your insurance will pay for it. but I've read soooo many articles on how bad they are, and I can't blame them ... I mean they see 10 wrecks like me daily ...  but yeah

&amp;#x200B;

can anyone relate and maybe has similar experiences or even strategies on how to get help when you already know a lot of things about mental health, addictions, and you believe that know one can really understand ?! .... thank you... im very desperate at the moment to find someone who understands, and who can help me.... I always thought it would be my ex girlfriend"
333,"I feel like I am a floating, amorphous blob with no direction or inclination. I know I have a personality, but I can't express it properly unless I am drunk, and I feel like I act around people however I feel like they would most want me to act.","I find most types of comedy funny, I can hang with so many different kinds of people. I am like Ditto the pokemon.

That may sound like a power but it's not. I want to be ME, not a shapeshifter who changes to whatever makes himself the most popular. I also don't know what career I want to do or have any specific goals in mind. I know what I \*don't\* want to do, but I don't know what I \*do\* want to do. I'm 23 and time is running out for me to get fresh graduate positions. I need to work out who I am FAST. But I am constrained by my own head that never expresses itself properly and \*can't\* because there's so many compaeting thoguhts, issues and problems.

I just want to \*be\* something, I want to have an identity. Yeah I have some attributes but those are the ones I express, not how I really feel inside."
334,Why is it that the ones who claim to care about mental health are always the ones to turn their backs?,"I've never attempted suicide but its certainly on the cards. I grew up with domestic violence and emotional abuse. I've got my own issues as everyone has, but whenever I try to get help I get shut down by those close to me. My ex and my brother both claim to be mental health advocates, yet any time I ever opened up to either of them, I was always compared to others and told I ""didn't have it that bad."" My ex would get frustrated and yell at me when I couldn't get the words out. Just today my brother told me ""don't be dramatic, you complain a lot and provide no examples, none of this is a big deal."" 

Just before Christmas I mentioned to my brother I was considering seeing a psychologist. At first he said it was a good idea, and then went on to say that I have no reason to. Of all people, he should understand what I've been through. 

Now I'm left scared to open up to others, bottling everything up all over again. 

Sorry."
335,I lost my mind yesterday.,"For years I (25M) have been struggling with social anxiety, and depression but yesterday I reached a breaking point. A thought popped into my head telling me that I could end up being alone forever, and I couldn't cope with it. I started crying uncontrollably, experienced heavy anxiety,  and I felt this massive feeling of self hatred and insignificance. It got so bad that I split myself into three alter egos (with names, and very distinct personalities) that night, and functioned as them for the entirety of the next day. This was a very very odd experience because I'm usually a very composed individual. Even when drunk I usually have a lot of control over my actions but I completley lost it yesterday. I felt as if ""I"" as a person didn't exist, and my ego's would refer to me the progenitor. They'd say things like ""the progenitor was so damaged that he left, and put us in charge."" I know this all sounds so crazy. Now, I'm feeling a bit better, and I'm back to being my whole self but I still feel kind of ""off"". The only thing that I have left to do is to keep trying, avoid negative thoughts, and hopefully I will be better one day"
336,Just my feeling rn it brings you nothing if you read this,"My mental health? yeah there's nothing wrong with it. I just don't have any purpose in my life, feel really uncomfortable around other people, i am always stressed but I procrastinate at the same time and never do anything. I never talk with my so called friends from school and my only clos4e friends I have are from my previous school which is in another country and I hate texting. I'm confused af about my sexuality and I hate myself. I don't have any hobby and the things I like are related to art but I'm bad at it. I sometimes cannot sleep but I don't want to admit it so start watching videos with no sense and I say I was just watching videos I like while I find it really boring but I don't know what to watch    and oh yeah i have suicidal thoughts and a guy in my school told me I should just kill myself. So too be honest i don't know wtf am i doing with my life."
337,Mental health system is making my mental health worse?,"I feel like I've been subjected to endless gaslighting and emotional manipulation since I was a child.

I have been seeing professionals since I was eight, for meltdowns and tantrums. I've been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, Tourette's, depression, and ADHD at various times by various professionals (I did not carry all diagnoses at once).

Now I only am diagnosed with OCD and Asperger's. I'm almost twenty-one, and suffer severe anxiety because I'm constantly afraid that whatever I'm doing at any given point in the day is pathological. I've become a walking mental health diagnosis. 

The bipolar dx was the worst. I was dxed at age thirteen with little to no explanation or elaboration. The doctor also dxed me with ADHD and Tourette's in a span of minutes via a cosmopolitan type quiz that I filled out. She had me on three meds and tried to put me on three more. No meds for anxiety, unfortunately. 

I am terrified of severe mania and psychosis. My parents think I'm being ""dramatic"", and what happened to me is ""not that bad."" They don't understand how serious a bipolar diagnosis really is, and that it's considered chronic. My mom keeps saying that even if I did have a manic episode at some point, I'm never going to have one again because ""it hasn't happened yet."" (?) They don't understand why I'm upset with my old doctor. I've been screamed at and slapped by my mom when having anxiety attacks and crying at night. And they wonder why I'm depressed...

Now I'm being pressured to go on SSRIs, which I was told for four years or so was the one class of medication I could never take. (Stimulants were okay though, apparently.) A doctor I saw at school told me that suffering was ""my choice."" I've tried to explain how much backlash I'd gotten from my mother and doctor for years at the suggestion of SSRIs and how anxious it made me, but I was dismissed and scolded.

I've been told that the trick is to ""stick with one doctor"" and ""not go doctor shopping"". Well, if I'd done that, I'd still be on 3-6 meds and sporting a ton of random dxes. Also, I was not ""doctor shopping"" at twelve years old. I was moving, doctors were finding new jobs, retiring, etc. ""Stick with one doctor"" is ridiculous advice given turnover rates due to factors we can't control. ""Self-diagnosis"" is also bad, only a doctor can diagnose me, but when they do, they do so in a matter of minutes, and no one can agree on anything. I get spun around and around in circles, then stripped of my agency and scolded when I try to take a stand.

What is the matter with this system? I feel worse than I did going into it. How do I reclaim my agency and feel confident again? I'm in despair, and the people who were supposed to help me won't acknowledge their role in creating that despair. :("

340,My boyfriend is depressed and being bullied. How do I help him?,"My (27F) boyfriend (31 M) is depressed and being bullied. How do I help him?

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. He's always struggled with life, though you'd never tell. He has a successful career and is well liked amongst his friends but often comes home and just sits near silently for hours before going to bed.
I tried to talk to him and he tells me he's just tired from putting on a display of happiness for everyone all the time and wants to be alone.

On his good days he's very attentive and does whatever I ask of him. I love him so much and it is so hard to see him struggle on his bad days.

He was at bar for a friend's birthday recently but came home early, having only stopped for 3 or 4 beers. 
It seems so stupid now but I ended up causing an argument because he'd not given the night out a chance.
We argued and he threw a mug at me which caught the side of my head. I ran out of the house and into the car where I stayed for half a hour. He didn't follow me and this is the first time he's ever done anything like this during an argument. We don't even argue that often.

Some nosy neighbour must have called the police because after the half hour they turned up, saw my head and lead my boyfriend away. I told them it was nothing and I'd slipped but my boyfriend told them the truth.

Now it's all over town and my boyfriend is being treated like some evil wife beater! His attention seeking ex has been all over Facebook claiming he was constantly violent to her too. It's all lies. 

He's a good man and this is a making his life worse. I've told police I don't want to pursue anything but they said they have to act because he admitted it. It's like they are determined to ruin his life over this. 

What else can I do to help him? 

Tl:Dr - my boyfriend is depressed and now being bullied because of an incident with the police."
341,No matter what I do I still can't come to like myself,"For the last couple months I've started hating myself, and even when I try to think about myself in a good light something will happen and bring me down again, and the cycle continues and only gets worse, I've tried talking to people about it and nothing has worked."
342,I (M/23) want to help my brother (M/12). Though I don’t want to be his therapist.,"My younger brother is dealing with a lot of issues i struggled with at his age and then some. 
I’ve worked on overcoming some of his problems so I know what worked for me, but his behavior really annoys me because it reminds of  the behaviors I didn’t like in myself. 

I’ve talked to our dad about getting him to a therapist for years and nothing has come about.  I want to take matters into my own hands. 

His parents are divorced and don’t care to get involved with this because they don’t want to talk to each other. 

What do I need to do to help him see a therapist? And can I just bring him to sessions myself or does he need parents involved? (We live in NY if that matters)

TL/DR: Want my brother to get help, can I bring him to see a therapist as his brother?"

344,I don't do well with change,I don't think many people do well with change. I have adjustment disorder so change hits me a lot harder than normal. Well just recently my boss at my job for fired and they brought someone new in. I don't know what all went on with her and why she lost her job and I don't care to know but it's rough and affecting me more than it should maybe. I can find myself slowly slipping and I don't know how to get out of it. I just got out of a bad depression couple weeks ago and I feel it coming back. This is so rough.
345,a problem i have with the diagnosis process,"Why is so much focus put on how other people view you? 

Both times they were looking into a possible diagnosis in these recent years they wanted to have numbers to people that knows me and wanted to speak to my mom who they knew I had not lived with for years. And wanted to see if their view of me matched my own. 

Like I get it because it gives a clearer picture of your issue IF you actually shared it with the people they wanted to talk to.   
I live alone and how would anyone ever know if I don't share that part of myself? I also think it's weird my doctor calling people basically being like ""do you think she has bipolar disorder?"" to people who are not mental health professionals and that don't live with me and when they say no she's like hmm very interesting.

When I was diagnosed at 13 the diagnosis was 100% based on other peoples view of me because I was not there and I've always felt they put way to much weight on what other people say. And before anyone says ""I've never felt that way"" that's fine but I feel like it has all taken longer time because no one they have called has been able to confirm I'm mentally ill because i'm so private"
346,Is your anger towards your enemies only hurting yourself? How I let go of resentment,"I've always clung onto grudges/resentment  - whether its politicians or people that I've perceived that had wronged me. It can feel empowering and motivating to feel anger towards to people that we think deserve it, but in the only I've realised that by doing this I'm only hurting myself.

I've found mindfulness to be really effective at letting go of these resentments by wishing my enemies well - I talk about it on the latest episode of my [podcast](https://anchor.fm/shaun-donaghy/episodes/Could-you-feel-compassion-for-Donald-Trump--Compassion-guided-meditation-eas8d8)."
347,I bought Humidifiers and Essential oils and they really helped!," I read an article about Essential oils and how they could be used to relieve a person from stress, anxiety and depression. I tried it for myself, first because I didn't really believe and wanted to try it out for myself. It really helped! It helped my muscle twitches a lot and overall I feel happier. I used an humidifier to use them, I think the essential oils can also be used with messaging but NOT DIRECTLY with skin. Putting them in humidifiers worked good for me though."
348,Something is stopping me,"This planet is odd, really. Humans can do everything, but they never have time to do it, so what's the point? If we want to do something why don't do it? 

Slipping into the world of imagination, when reality is too hard. Some of us don't want to come back and I'm one of them. I wanna stay like this forever, run away, dissapear, die... 

We're stuck in an endless loop of living, day by day, sometimes with a reason, sometimes without. I don't really understand it. It's too complicated for me to comprehend and yet, I'm still here. A long time ago I established some strong barriers, when I was really scared and lonely and oddly enough, they're the only thing that holds me here so strongly. 

Sometimes I feel like empty void and I ask myself ""Is this how death feels?"", It isn't bad, good neither.

I might day in a second, writing this or after living long life, I don't know. I just think that it wouldn't be that bad.

I want to die, but something is stopping me. Whenever I'm on the edge and I feel like doing it, I just can't. I don't know why. Maybe I'm scared of pain? Maybe it's the thought of what would happen if it wouldn't kill me? Or maybe I wanna live? The last is the least true.

In this world we aren't born equal, everyone learns it from the very young age. One is born in full of love family and the other is left with nothing, without anyone to care about him.

I sometimes ask myself ""Where's my courage?"", but I never know the answer.

Sometimes I get myself to eat healthy and work, but the other days I just stay in bed, without any intention of doing anything.

""Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."" as John Lennon said. 

Could it also refer to bring busy imagining the better future? As you're not working towards it. Maybe you don't have enough strength to do so, or you don't want to take any risks, I don't know.

I don't think that dying is so bad. When you think you've done enough here and don't have anything more to accomplish or you just aren't able to comprehend the pressure of living, you should be able to leave. Leave forever.

Leave everything behind, go forward.

Working towards bright future is odd, when all you want to do is leave this planet. You just think about everything being pointless in the end, but if everyone would think the same, you wouldn't be there.

I like to think that there's nothing to loose, so do what you want. Others don't think like me and I can't fight them all, so I have to listen to them. No thoughts, head empty, listen to them and do what they want.

The life isn't about bright future, it's about the present. No matter what happened or what will happen, you will still be you.

Sometimes, the past will hold you back, or it's the present that hurts, does it mean that your future won't come? No, it means that you have to fight for it. 

It's hard to fight alone and I know it personally. Be kind to yourself and tell your friends that you love them, before all the hope is lost.

I don't want to be alone. I need a friend that I can talk to about everything, but 'everything' is holding me from doing it. Secrets are meant to stay secret.

I want to die. If I would die today, I would die happy, seriously. But I don't have enough power.

I know that tomorrow may bring me the power to be happy, but waiting is unbearable, especially when you've been waiting for so long.

Please, help me

I don't know what is happening

I'm alone

My brain is killing me

Nobody cares

They don't care

I don't care



I'm just a fool"
349,Need YOUR help here. I can't chat with my friend who has anorexia and depression,"My best friend has those both things and I really care and worry about her. We often don't understand each other but we usually don't argue about it. Lately we argue more and more often. I'm trying to cheer her up then but I feel like I'm making it even worse. Every my word matters how she will react and it's result is really often negative. We chat in messenger so it makes things easier and harder in the same time. If you can give me some kind of advise how to speak with her and don't hurt her, please do so. Also I wasn't chatting with her for almost 2 days. She wrote me 2 messages today, the first one I haven't read and the next one was blaming me that I didn't ask her about how was her performance yesterday. Now I am afraid to talk to her and argue again. Please help. Sorry for bad english."

354,"It’s hasn’t been my day, week, month, or even my year. Here’s my story.","Let me start this off, my name is Alex and I’m a 18 y/o Asian guy. Growing up in a Asian family with a older and younger sister just made me feel really left. Maybe classic middle kid syndrome? Anyways I grew up not looking the best, and started to eat a lot to cope with the loneliness because I didn’t really have friends and my family forgets about me all the time.

Fast forward to freshman year, after many attempts, I finally start dating this girl, she was the most caring and understanding girl I’ll probably ever meet, even lost my virginity to her, and she loved me the way I was. A year into the relationship she tells me she has Huntington’s disease, a irreversible, incurable disease that’ll degrades her nervous system. I was heartbroken, the one person that truely loves me is cursed with this horrible disease. 

She hid it for me for a couple months before this scared that I’ll leave her, but no way in hell was I leaving her, loved her even more. Another 6 months passes and she needs to go off to college. She decides to break up, and I’m in no position to ask her to stay, so we end it. And this really messed me up, and I never really let her know.

I started binge eating, grades started slipping, life kinda just fell apart, started crying ever night. One day I finally had enough and manned up and asked my parents to see a psychiatrist, and they said “if you lost some weight you’ll be happy again, stop being fat” 

That fucked me up. Hard. I’ve had body image issues all along and is just recovering from a breakup, and lost the support of my parents, and soon everyone in the family. I’ve never felt so alone, ever. I need help but I can’t get it."
355,Depression driving a wedge between my (21M) relationship with my girlfriend (20F),"I recently went to see a psychotherapist who thinks I have a Major Depressive Disorder. I have known about these symptoms in myself for a long time but have been neglectful in getting help until now. My girlfriend is also dealing with a number of major mental health issues too and I'm beginning to to feel that it's becoming an issue for the relationship. We are also going to school in a city where we only have each other as friends and we've been relying on each other for all our support. I hate that this is happening since she's by far the most wonderful person I've ever been with but due to the severity of both our issues I'm afraid that it might be making it worse to be around each other so much. 

If anyone has some advice on the situation I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks :)"

358,Tired All the Time,"I'm a full time employee (overnights), a full time college student (days), and a single mother (have him half the time). I'm exhausted all of the time. It's probably because of my schedule, but I'm wondering if I'm depressed too. I haven't taken a shower in days, haven't cleaned my house, haven't cooked (ordering out), have barely done any school work. I wake up after 10 hours of sleep still exhausted. I just skipped an exam so I can sleep. It won't affect my grade in the long run, but I didn't know the material anyway, which will start to affect my grade.

I do have bipolar and my meds were recently switched because of weight gain. I was on Lamictal and Invega (among others). Those have been discontinued for Tegretol. I'm wondering if that's part of why I'm so exhausted as well, and if it's bringing on depression. My psychiatrist doubled my antidepressant when I told him. I'm not sad or suicidal; I'm just effectively useless right now. I am seeing a therapist.

My house is getting to the point where I'm worried for my son. If CPS was called right now, I'm not sure if I'd pass the test. I love him so much, but I can't find the motivation or energy to do something about it. He deserves so much better.

Does depression present like this? Please help me help myself and my son."

362,I feel so guilty,"I suffer from major depression &amp; bpd2 and right now im in a depressive episode. There’s not much I do during these times other than go to work, eat, sleep, and go on my phone. It’s survival mode really, I’m not living.

But I have a dog. And I try so hard to walk him, but sometimes there are days were I don’t. I haven’t walked him in three days (we have a backyard so he does get out to run and do his business, but he deserves a walk.) We snuggle and sleep in the same bed and he gets pets all the time. 

But it’s so hard to play with him. It’s so boring. I try to engage and play tug of war or fetch but i just… don’t care. I love this dog with my whole heart but i just don’t want to play or walk. It takes so much fucking energy.

And i feel so fucking guilty. I feel like he deserves a better life, where his owners always play with him and they’re much happier and attentive than i am. I don’t know how to shake this guilt. It goes to my core, and suddenly everything I do isn’t enough for him and it just isn’t right. I struggle with keeping him because I’m constantly battling the thoughts of “he deserves better, you can’t give him what he needs” even though I’ve had him for almost two years now.

Does anyone else struggle with guilt? Does anyone have any tips on how to combat these thoughts and feelings?? I’m in therapy right now so i do have tips for when i’m spiraling but it’s just so hard not to feel overwhelmed with guilt when all you can do is sit in bed and wallow abt how bad of an owner you are.

Thanks for reading and sorry it’s word vomit but i feel like i’m drowning in this emotion."
363,Thinking of relocating for my mental health,I moved to a new city in the same state as my home city for a job opportunity (first career job) and I'm thinking about going somewhere totally new. I'm having a hard time being happy here partially because I was in an abusive relationship when I moved and because I don't entirely fit in here. I'm trying to have more creative outlets and start a band but I just feel sad frequently. Originally I was going to try to start a relationship with someone I knew that moved far away but it didn't work out so that's got me a little upset as well. I have a potential job opportunity on the other side of the country and it could be lucrative. Should I take it or am I just running away from my problems?
364,"I feel like I'm an actor constantly playing a version of myself, trying to tailor it for a particular audience.","Even when I'm home alone, I feel like I'm either playing for an audience of ""future me"" or I'm doing something that's a form of escapism.

My therapist said that recognizing the recipient of my actions in everything is excellent and a sign of empathy, but I can't help but feel it's counterproductive.  On top of that, if every interaction is fake, what even is real connection?"
365,Nightmares,"I have recently had nightmares. Weekly pretty much. When I was 12, I had a time period where I had nightmares often like this. But eventually they went away. Why? I don't know. I have depression and anxiety and I'm wondering what I could do to help myself get a better sleep until hopefully this goes away. I've already been on depression medicine before but I find that my depression is just worse in the winter. I can't go outside because of the snow. I'm about to be going through some big changes in the sense that I am going to get my license and start schooling for my future job as a 20 yr old. I also just escaped from a toxic relationship last may. I feel as if this is why I am having my nightmares, I don't know. I also wake up in the middle of the night often every week or so. Does anyone have more info about constant nightmares like this? Is it insomnia to keep waking up so early? How do you deal with this? I think I need to start drinking chamomile tea and honey before bed. I also rarely drink caffeine, (I used to drink it constantly but stopped because of dehydration issues) but I have somewhat frequently this week. Could that have anything to do with this? (It doesn't explain my nightmares when I don't have caffeine though)

This might sound like so many questions and some people might think this is the wrong place for this but I thought I'd ask here since my mental health could be causing this. I just wanna know if anyone has dealt with this and found their mental health has caused them. Especially since my first sign of depression was when I was 12 yrs old aka my first year of nightmares constantly. Thanks to whoever reads and comments."
366,Should I let my relationship go because it is too much to ask people around me to be sensitive to my mental state all the time,"31F struggling with mood swings, tendency to be overtly sensitive and bitter and just plain sad with out reason. I think it is too much to ask another person to live with someone like me, especially if they are the kind of people who prefer the company of people who are light hearted, fun loving and just able to laugh and smile. All of my partner's friends etc are exactly that kind of people. Maybe in the initial years of the relationship I was like that too but stuff has happened and I feel increasingly struggling with spells of sadness and just feeling dark. The pressure of making sure I do not pull him into this dark hole worsens my situation many times over. I feel guilty of ruining someone's life, while at this moment they could be with someone who had a happier take towards every day things. I feel the same about most of my friends who clearly have started avoiding me because of how sad I am all the time, and my partner is stuck with me and can leave coz we are married. We have fights often and he has told me that I sometimes make him sad and he doesn't want to be sad any more and wants to live a normal life. 

I am not sure how to go about this? part of me feels I will be able to deal with my own condition better if I don't have the pressure of having to feel bad about this thing in my life. I am very confused."

369,"Concerned about my brother's behavior, what should I do?","I believe that my brother may have Antisocial Personality Disorder. He is 23.

That is a bold statement, Ik. That is an often misunderstood diagnosis, Ik. Whether or not the terminology is correct, I believe that my brother is spirally downward rapidly.

I could tell you many stories of how he's exhibited antisocial tendencies. Lack of conscience/remorse, impulsive behavior, manipulation and deceit, superiority complex. They all fit. But I always chalked it up to him being a ""jerk"". My family as a whole has never considered his behavior a serious issue, they just call it ""immaturity"". Something happened today that makes me believe this is a much deeper issue.

(Sidenote: I must admit, in the past he's hurt me and a label like this would be an attempt to protect my own insecurities. This post has nothing like that attached to it. No anger. No resentment. No sorrow, or jealously. This post is coming from a place of deep concern and fear and any thoughts are deeply appreciated.)

I came from out of town to visit him. We were traveling by foot in a busy part of the city. Something had taken over him and he had been walking down the sidewalk with his hands up on his hips, his chest pushed out, and accentuating every solid, confident step he took. It was like a caricature of a confident person. That was strange in itself, but then we reached an intersection, where both sides were stopped and waiting to cross. It's a busy area so there's many people across the way come across. When the light changes, he moves forward in the same self-assured way as before. And as the opposite group moves towards him, he walks straight through them. No adjustment in speed, or direction. He walks straight into a crowd of crossing pedestrians. Hitting some, knocking others off balance. Looks of confusion and anger. Their faces saying, *what was that for?????* Myself thinking the same thing.

I grab him and say “What are you doing!?”

He replies, “I'm crossing the street, it’s not my fault they didn’t move.”

""W..what??"" I say, still piecing together the situation in my head.

""It's the city, you move out the way or get hit.""

I tell him, ""don't you realize how extremely rude that is?""

""I don't care."" he replies.

Not a speck of remorse on his face.

No justification attempted.

The conversation ends there, and he sees something he likes and begins to tell me how he wants to buy one for himself.

\~

My brother has done decently terrible things in the past. But they always ""made sense"" or were explicable in his own seriously convoluted way. He stole that money because he deserves the money more than that person, for xyz reason. He made up that devastating story about so-and-so because an action they did *could have* meant this, which resulted in that, and they need to be punished.

But these things were always ""minor"", for lack of a better word. Involving a parent or sibling. Contained within the environment of our immediate family. And as I mentioned before, explainable from his perspective whether I agreed with him or not. 

This act had absolutely no justifiable reason behind it. No matter how twisted. And these were strangers. It may sound like a small act, bumping into someone. But it shook me deeply to witness it and I can't stop thinking about it. I felt very scared in the moment, for I felt there were some very severe implications in this seemingly small act.

What is the difference between “walks straight into a crowd, does not slow down” and “drives straight into a crowd, does not slow down”. Same thoughts, different setting.

\~

Combined with this, my brother has developed an increasingly destructive lifestyle. Which is evidently getting worse, from the four days I spent with him. There's a lot to unpack, but workaholism, alcoholism, and unstable relationships have been part of his life for awhile now, and are not slowing down. However, he is also highly successful and in a way has been rewarded for the extreme nature of his personality.

I am extremely concerned for him. And I can't stop thinking about what happened today. I can imagine many different outcomes to his increasingly detrimental behavior and none of them are good. Drug overdose. Drunken accident. Suicide. I could see a twisted fate in which he hurts someone, or is hurt himself and I am scared for him.

I feel like I should talk to my parents, however I'm not sure how to do so without initiating the standard string of events would be: talk to them, they scold him, he gets upset with me, and no progress is made. 

What should I do?"

374,How can I manage symptoms of ADHD and depression on my body own?,"I’ve never been officially diagnosed with either, so that’s why I’m referring to the symptoms and not the actual disorders. I don’t want to necessarily self diagnose myself but I do have symptoms of both. 

I live in a rural town with no resources, I have little money and no insurance. As a result, I do not have a way to see a professional. I’ve looked into all of my options, and basically there are none. But I’m at a point where I need to do something because I’ve gotten to a very rough point in my life. 

Some background: I’m currently 19 and female. When I was young I was part of the “gifted and talented” crowd. Had good grades because my parents made sure I always did my work and studied. Once I got old enough to not have their constant supervision (about 6th grade, age 11) is when I started struggling though. I’d constantly forget to do my homework or just not do it because I didn’t want to and it was boring. I made it through high school with a decent gpa because my easy classes kept it up and my hard classes were weighted, so if I was making Cs it would go on my GPA as Bs. I did super well on ACT and SAT testing without much studying, mostly because I felt like it was a competition I had to win. Like getting better scores than other people or whatever. Because of test my scores, dad’s military benefits, and financial aid due to low income, I got what added up to a free ride to a decent state school. That was a year and a half ago. 

I got to college and all motivation and I had left me. At first I wasn’t depressed too much, but I was lonely and didn’t make friends and my classes were hard. I dropped half of them and ended up sleeping with strangers on the internet to fill my desire for attention. Around the end of the first semester I went to the free school therapist and he told me there were other people doing way worse than me and he didn’t think I needed to be there. Granted, I didn’t tell him all of my problems because I wasn’t exactly comfortable, but he was right that I was managing to bullshit my way through the semester with a 3.0 gpa. However, the next semester went even worse and I actually failed a couple classes. I was having an emotionally draining “relationship” with a way older man who was giving me lots of money, alcohol, and adderall that I was abusing. All of that ended and I moved home for the summer to work and see my old friends. That was relatively uneventful. But I did start a FWB type relationship with a guy I went to high school with, which is sort of currently still going on but more about that later. 

So I went back to college last August and got a great job and things were okay until they weren’t. My best and only friend dropped out and moved far away and I was living by myself and super alone. I stopped going to class at all and the only thing I did was go to work and stay in bed all day. I failed or dropped out of every single class I took and ended the semester with a 1.7 gpa. At this point I’ve lost all my financial aid and scholarships, and currently owe $9k to my college and can’t reenroll until I pay it off. 

I moved back home and returned to my job and living with my parents like I had over the summer. It felt like rock bottom. I loved my job at school and had to give it up. Then, things got even worse and I found out I was pregnant from the guy I went to high school with. I had to tell him and he had to take me to a city two hours away over a course of three trips in order to have an abortion. The actual pregnancy and abortion didn’t affect me emotionally but his lack of concern and caring for me made me even more depressed. I should also mention that we’ve both confessed feelings before but never actually started a real relationship. Now that the abortion is over I still constantly think about him but I don’t want to.

I also did not have any insurance or anything and had to max out my credit cards for the abortion. Currently 2k in credit card debt on top of the 9k I owe to the school. Basically I feel like I’m drowning and can’t find a way out. I feel so alone and sad all the time. I can’t find the motivation to start self learning math so I can go back to school. I don’t do anything but sleep and work once again. I need to find a way to manage this but I don’t know where to start.

Sorry for the long post. I know it will probably go unread but I just started writing and it all came out."
377,Sleep Hallucinating,"Not asking for a diagnosis, I'm definitely addressing with with my doctor. But, has anyone suffering from depression or anxiety had hallucinations while in light sleep? I woke up last night, or at least I thought I did, and heard my boyfriend talking to his friends online. But what I heard was some horrific shit, and when I asked him about it this morning, he said they were all joking and like saying weird stuff, but not exactly what I recalled. I have had dreams come into life before, where I thought he was drowning while we were in bed, thought we were both being attacked, etc. I've had night terrors in the past, but this feels a lot different."
378,How does one make friends?!,"First post. Ever. 

I’m 28, married, have a son. I have 1-2 close friends that I can share stuff with... and obviously my wife. She’s great by the way. 

But seriously how does a normal person go and make friends in life?? Or even online?? Especially when you’re not all kinda awkward?"
379,Who feels as if suicidal thoughts trigger their depression and not the other way around?,It always seems when my suicidal thoughts get riled up is when I get hopeless and what not.
380,I'll try,"Since July I had odd thoughts and at first I thought they were there due to my sadness. But then, those thoughts became louder and louder, and now, they're so loud that I need help. 

Those weird thoughts are suicidial thoughts. And at first I was just planning my funereal, as I thought that I wouldn't be able to kill myself, doing so, was calming my mind a little. 

It came to the point that I wanna really wanna do it and that I'm able to

I wanna seek for help, but I don't know what will happen

What will happen, when I'll say that to my psychologist? I wanna know as I'm scared of changes"
381,There's nothing I've done right,"Every day just revolves around what I've done wrong, what new thing I've messed up, what I've forgotten to do, again. It's come to a point where I've begun imagining someone shouting my name to tell me off. My hands shake all the time, and I'm in a constant state of panic, anxiety, and fear. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, 3 hours may go by with quiet, but something will always crop up that I'm being told off for not doing, even though I'm really trying my best. I've stopped leaving the house when I can because I come home from being happy to being shouted at for forgetting to do something or another, and it's just not worth the sudden deflation of joy. I'm really trying, but it's not good enough. Getting everything right is feasible reasonable, but even if I try, it goes from being shouted at 8 times a day to only about 3. I don't know how long I can take it, but I've even failed at ending my life, so there's really no point at all."
382,"I had a ptsd attack at work, and my boss told me I was upsetting the other employees. I feel like such a bother.","I have ptsd from an abusive relationship that I got out of 4 years ago. I’ve been in therapy, and I’ve actually been making huge improvements over the years. I still deal with bad anxiety, but I haven’t had a ptsd attack in over a year. 
Well, yesterday at work something happened. I work at a popular coffee shop. I usually don’t work saturdays but I picked up the shift to earn a little extra money. I walked up to the register to help someone and it was my ex. He had no idea I worked there and I couldn’t see who was at the register until I actually walked up to it, so it wasn’t like I knew he was there. I ran to the back of the store to the employee break room and just had a break down. One employee saw and ran to get my manager. She knew I had ptsd because she went trough something very similar to me and knows how scary it can be. She also knows I tend to get violent if people intervene while I’m having an attack. I can calm myself down, I just need space to breathe and ground myself. 
When it was over, my manager sent me home for the day and said I scared the other employees and I over reacted. He didn’t even say anything to me so why did I have to get all scared and anxious?
I can’t control my emotions with something like this. I feel like I caused a huge scene and bothered people, but I wasn’t expecting him to just walk into the store when I haven’t seen him face to face in 4 years. I feel like all of my progress is just thrown out now..."
383,I’m an asshole,"I don’t understand why all of a sudden people are so mad at me. I’m trying to understand if it’s just me, but I’ve never been like this. All of a sudden the things I think are funny jokes and not a big deal everyone’s pissed off about it! I wanna say that they are being snowflakes like most people today. I wish I could just understand people. Maybe it’s cause I’m may be an aspie but Jesus, I not gt this. :("
384,My family and I is putting a lot of pressure on me.,"I'm 19 and a girl. Single since forever. Now my mom is really concerned about this. She always asks me when I'll have a SO, when she'll have grandkids etc etc.

Now don't get me wrong I would love to have a gf or bf but it is not that easy. I see everyone in my life getting a boyfriend getting into a serious relationship with them. Or at least them all having been on dates. I have not a lot of experience in that.

Guys tend to either completely ignore me or see me as a sex toy. It hurts but for now it has been the truth and well most girls I meet are straight which isn't that surprising.

I don't go out at all. I'm only at school, my tutor and on weekends I have a job. Even if I would go out into town into a bar or club I'd be so uncomfortable there. I don't want to go alone and none of my friends have the time to meet with me. Maybe they don't even want to.

I also don't want to get a dating app. I don't want to be that desperate.

I don't know what to do. I would like to be in a relationship. My mom probably thinks that if I don't get a bf before I turn twenty I drop dead into a grave and I feel like I'm so unlovable and boring that no one wants me.

My past doesn't make it better. All of my male relatives were huge assholes and left me with deep trauma or pain. I don't want to dive deep into it but let's just say I'm afraid to end up like my mom.

The pressure on me getting a bf is so fucking high that when I'm around guys I immediately think I have to impress them so that they fall in love with me. I honestly at this point dont even know if I'm doing that for myself or for my mom.

I'm just tired of being so alone. I want someone that I can share a deep connection with but I guess I'll never have that. And yes I'm aware that I'm ""only 19"" but I'm a 100% sure that I'll have the same situation with 26. 

I know I'm young and I don't need to rush things but my family makes me feel like a freak for not ever being in a relationship that I just feel bad.

I really don't know how to overcome my trauma, the pressure from the inside and my familys pressure.

TLDR: I am single since day one, I have unresolved traumas and issues that keep me away from having healthy ideas of relationships, my family especially my mom make me feel like a freak because I have been single my entire life, all of my friends have a bf, I have low self esteem and I don't have the time and courage to go outside and meet new people. I also do not want to go outside alone and since my friends are all busy they can't go with me."
385,I feel like I'm losing control. I'm spiraling and I don't know how to catch myself anymore.,"I'm spiraling. I'm spiraling and I dont know how to catch myself. I've dealt with a lot of mental health issues growing up and through the years I've become pretty good at handling things but this time around, I'm stumped and nothing is working. It just feels like theres too much pushing down on me. I'm doing everything I can but its just too much.

I've cried every single day since the beginning of December and to make it worse, there are a number of things at my job that trigger the trauma I just went through so 5 days a week, every week I'm sent back into that horrible headspace. I just want 1 day without a single tear. I've been in therapy and I'll be seeing a psychologist in March but it just feels like the effort put forth just doesnt compete with the weight of everything.

On top of all of the anxiety and PTSD I've been dealing with, I'm also dealing with a lot of financial hardships. I'm doing everything I can but I just got paid on Friday and I'm already down to $180 because of bills and $80 of that has to go to therapy on Tuesday and I'm going to need another $80 the following Tuesday for therapy again. This has been my life for the past 2 months and is going to continue being my life for the long, foreseeable future.

My entire pride and joy of my life's work and career is a sound system for when I work concerts and things have been so bad for me that I'm having to sell it. I hate it! I worked so hard to get all of that equipment! Getting rid of it makes me feel like I'm getting rid of a huge part of myself. That sound system encompasses everything about me and my passion for my work and what I've dedicated my life to.

I've never been the one to really contemplate suicide, it has crossed my mind before but is always dismissed as quickly as it entered but lately it's been popping into my head more often and stronger than before. I dont feel like it's a serious concern for me right now but I will admit that I am afraid of what might become if things dont change. 

I just dont know what to do anymore. Despite the depression, I force myself to do the things I need to do to keep myself afloat but its just not working! Today is particularly bad and I can't hold myself together. I've been quietly crying at work for the past hour and with the triggers I have to deal with here, it's only going to get worse as the day progresses. I'm already starting to shake and twitch and spaz and my body is tensing up real bad.

I feel like I'm losing control."
386,The antidepressants are working,"Day seven on antidepressants. I have just taken my eighth tablet.

Yesterday was the day I think the positive effects came through. The first day was good, because it gave me good sleep. Days 2 through 5 were not good. 

I know they are working. How? Because I have made a schedule and I have at least in part stuck to it 2 days in a row. Every time I have tried this over the past 4 or so years, I have failed. I try to pick myself up, say this time it is going to be different, but the next day I am worse than before and back to time wasting. 

I am starting unambitious, but I have got work done that I was not absolutely required to. I picked up my guitar, followed some tabs with intention, learned part of a song, just like yesterday I learned the start of it. And tomorrow I will learn the next part of it. I finished a piece of homework over a week in advance. I started another piece not due for 3 weeks.

It is different this time. I needed a drug, but it has changed me. Only slightly, I understand now.

My social anxiety has lessened slightly, I will attend my universitys social networking group next week, as I only just managed this week for the first time. Even though it is painful, I feel it is not painful enough to forego interaction any more.

Unfortunately the fatigue is extreme. I sleep between 11 and 12 hours. However, it is better than my previous situation, as now I feel some motivation to catch up with recorded lectures. 

There was complete disconnect between present and future, but now I think I see reason to be active again."
387,Someone with diagnosed OCD,"Right now in my life i am currently in the process of getting insurance and like going to a psychiatrist but i want to go in with a perfect understanding of my head and say what i truly mean, and i am having a huge understanding that i show like extreme signs of OCD and like i know i have something with my personality and i just want to talk about it for right now with someone with it diagnosed so i can feel like im right 
If not i will be completely understandable and will not castrize you. I just need a little help."
388,I get more and more into bad habits and obsessive daydreaming,"Im having a lot of trouble to start new habits in my daily life and thought a habittracker might work for me. But that´s not the case. I got better to do a few things more often than before like reading. It´s not really helping with ""new"" habits that I normally wouldn´t do. I struggled with a lot of perfectionism for like the last five years since im 17 and started to get to work. This all or nothing mentality. And everytime I wasn´t able to do it perfect I gave up and wasn´t trying until I start all over to do it perfect. That really got me in a lot of bad habits. I became a really messy person and never make any progress with hobbys and stuff like that. I know that I feel good if a do sports or pratice guitar but i struggle so much to do it even slight regular like twice in a month. Because when I go home after work the first thing I do is start the TV. I don´t even watch it, I feel like I need something in the background so I don´t get into bad thoughts. While the Tv is in background I´m on the laptop on the same time. Scrolling total aimless through the Internet.

Or I can spend my time with hours of daydreaming. Its kind a obsession for me.I´m having a complete set of characters in my mind, its like book characters in my [mind.Th](https://mind.Th) story can change from one hour or day completly, sometime I go back to a story I had before. The characters itself stay the same, I got a few more than years ago and I often change their backstory. If I watch movies or anything character based like books or tv series it has huge influence about this daydreaming. I often hate if, because it changes my characters or the story.It often get intense when i listen to music, so I listen to it all the time. Even if I just go downstairs to get something for like 2min. But I don´t need to listen to music to get there. So if I go to work and kind of have to interrupt it ´s really horrible and I need some time to get into work. If its not a busy day at work and i´m not 100% concentrated at something I have these thought. Even if I talk to a costumer its sometimes only for one sentence in my mind of that world until then I go back to reallity. Its like my life is in the way for these thoughts. I´m kind of a sensitive person that always repress my bad feelings until they got back out of nowhere.  And don´t get me wrong I thing its really helpful for my life in general. So I rather life in that daydreaming then thinking about personal bad stuff. So I don´t want to get rid of it complete, but I feel like I don´t have any control over it. Is that normal or from why is it happening?  I don´t think that it´s healthy and I don´t remember when it started but like a long time ago. I´m 22 now. I had a time when I tried to write it down, the characters and the story but I gave up after a few days because it was so chaotic. I was like 16 back then and so I know that those characters changed since then. But they in general didn´t change in the past years. 

 So when I look back at what I did in my freetime or on the weekend it was totally unproductive and I didn´t really do anything. It´s really embarrassing and its horrible for my mental health that is already really messy. I moved to my first own apartment two months ago so I thought it would help me to start all over, out of the environment before. But I now see that I always go back to bad habits. Like 90% of the stuff I do is the bad habits. I made little changes like doing laundry regular and stuff like that. But I already see my apartment get more chaotic every day and sometimes I can get myself to do little talks, but I really need to force myself and its not enough.Thought about placing Notes as a physical reminder so I read them everyday but im really insecure what is helping. Kind of weird to ask but I really need help with the situation I´m in and I feel like I lose control over my life. 

Sorry for all the mistakes, english isn´t my first language. So I just want to ask for any advise that can help me."
389,"I'm a minor living in the US, California. How can I get diagnosed/screened?",I've read so many articles and I'm so so confused because I'm dumb.

391,Valentine's day,"So my fiance of 2 years and girlfriend of 5 texted me this morning saying that she doesnt feel appreciated because I didnt get her anything for valentine's day (she didnt get me anything either) but she asked what i wanted but i didnt know how to answer 

I also couldnt spend the day with her because i have to work my schedule is werid i work at a gas station so my job isnt i would say stressful but its different. But so my job is constantly stressing me out because I dont know when I'm going to work or who I'm going to have to cover because they are sick.

She claimed that we never go out that she doesnt mind staying in but that we do it to much but by the time I get off work its 11 30 at night and I'm exhausted both physically and emotionally from just dealing with rude and just mean customers which come in almost every day 

It just makes me feel bad because I want to spend time with her but I work constantly and I cant just call off I'm one of the main closers 

I dont know it just makes me feel bad because I want and need to spend more time with her and i dont want her to feel like she's not appreciated"
392,Best ways to get out of your head/ reduce anxiety?,I've really been struggling with anxiety recently. I've had it bad in the past but recently ive got it alot worse from seemingly no where and get sick to my stomach from it. I've started to get anxiety attacks where I just suddenly feel shit and get stuck in my head thinking shit thoughts about everything. I've found the only real way I can stop my anxiety temporarily is working out or talking to people and I can't do either as often as I need my anxiety to subside. Anyone got any ways they release this kind of anxiety?
393,Suspecting I have aspergers- would it be worth it to get diagnosed?," It has been suggested to me by three different counselors/therapists that I have aspergers/autism. I went to a psychiatrist years ago and did some psychological tests but she ruled it out before I finished all of them saying that my IQ was too high for me to have it (???)

My questions are 1) Is there any real point in getting diagnosed?

and 2) Are you diagnosed / is someone you know diagnosed and how did that help or hurt them?"

I want to hurt myself, but i'm scared that my family will see the scars, so i intentionally look at thing that will make me upset. I don't know how to stop. It started to affect me outside the internet. When i'm alone with my thoughts or when i'm just walking, terrible things come to my mind (like a giant needle going trough my heart or being torn apart by a flock of birds). I never thought about hurting other people, but now i'm scared that i will normalize these things in my head and hurt my loved ones unintentionally. I thought about killing myself before things get too far. If anyone has any advice please tell me. I don't know how to talk to anyone irl about this"

This just happened all of the sudden even though I’ve had GREAT sympathy for animal before. Am I turning into a psychopath or is this extreme case of cute aggression?"

I hate my life. Nothing ever changes. I keep sitting in this cramped fucking room every single day. I want to end it all. I'm tired of living. I'm sick of this body. I'm sick of everything and everyone. Nothing i did helped me. I don't think i'll ever be happy again. I just want to find something that makes me happy. I don't know why i even hope. I don't have any friends. Barely ever did. I have my sisters, but they don't understand me. Nobody i met understands me. I don't even understand myself. I just feel like i wasn't supposed to be a person. I don't know how to live a human life. I feel like i was supposed to be a shark, or a leaf or something like that"

403,Need help finding the cause and cure of my brain fog,"So I've been smoking weed for 3 1/2ish years, been having seizures for about 2 to 2 1/2 years, ages I've basically had a foggy mind, can't retain info, I can barely feel my emotions, and I basically feel more disabled than I already am. On October 27th 2019 I drank too much and got alcohol poisoning, which lead to me throwing up the next 3 days and became low on magnesium so I had a night seizure (probably another grand mal) and fell off my bed into my shoulder which pops out and in at certain angles and it huuuuuuuurts. After the alcohol poisoning, it was Halloween when I felt okay again, but I didn't just feel okay... The brain fog was completely cured and I felt my emotions so vividly I could've sobbed at anything. While I was recovering I didn't smoke about weed, and the brain fog was gone. But when I took a break that was a week long, I felt literally no difference in my clarity, and I'm just so desperate to feel and be connected again, no anxiety or stuttering.

I don’t have thoughts about hurting other people, but when I watch certain videos like running the gauntlet, it kind of gives me a rush. I wonder if it’s bad that it happens to me, and if I should stop or if I’m a psychopath or if I need help."
405,Feeling like I'm the only one that actually exists.,"I don't want this to sound narcissistic in any way I don't think I'm a narcissistic person, or at least I don't want to be.

Sometimes a thought occurs to me, leaving a lasting impression on me for the following days. I question whether I am the only person that actually exists.

It feels as if everyone else is fake. I'm the only person that exists in this world, nothing is worthwhile and everybody is following this system. Maybe it's because I'm good at noticing when people are lying; too good I suppose. Everybody ends up lying, usually to protect them from the social isolation that comes with authenticity. Maybe it's just because of my age, I'm in my teens, I guess people are like that. But this lack of originality and truth in people's behaviour really isn't helping my mental state.

Maybe it's because I'm so painfully average. Everything in my life is so-- average: My grades, my appearance, my home, my family. I'm not incredibly poor and I'm not wealthy either. It feels like a test; 'how well can you cope under these situations?'. Last year was awful for me and my family. Our house got flooded, during the repairs it got contaminated with asbestos, we lived in a hotel for months, went on holiday and got our passports stolen, my mum lost her dad - my grandad.

It feels like no one else can understand, of course they could - if they tried. I'm sure people will, but at least people my age don't. I don't want to sound like one of those kids that intentionally doesn't fit in but I just hate it.

It's gotten to the point where I'm just drifting through life. I've got no motivation. I'm on autopilot. My memory is getting worse. Everything feels hazy, especially school. I'm becoming more and more withdrawn, from people and my family. I hate opening up, I hate that I'm typing this. I'll probably end up deleting this or something later on. I don't care about school anymore. I want to like having friends; I want my friends to like me. I miss the past so much and I fear the future. I'm not existing myself, not like I used to.

406,How do I make it stop?,"For almost a month now I've had increased anxiety and paranoia. At times it's all consuming and seriously affects my mood to the point I get angry/upset or annoyed at trivial things for extended periods of time. 

As a result of previous circumstances I already have decreased self-confidence and self-esteem. I find it hard to trust people and don't think myself to be a priority to others. My issues are by no means as bad as they could be but recently it is affecting me more than usual.

In the past counselling has opened boxes without closing them or offering strategies, explanations or reasons to close them. So I am dubious to engage again.

I just want to feel at peace, does anyone have any recommendations to ease these feelings?"

408,Any tips on pushing past an emotionally taxing parent to improve yourself?,"My father has been emotionally and when my parents were still together physically abusive to me (I’m now 16M) due to me being his youngest child. He is not only a drug addict and alcoholic who chose those over his 5 children, but is also a compulsive liar. In the 3 years and 3 months it has been since my parents split up he has lied and claimed to: 
-Have cancer
-Have Parkinson’s
-Have Emphysema(did not have at the time but now does)
-Been sober for months yet called me drunk every day the week before.

In the past 4 months he has spent 3 weeks in hospital, each time due to either drinking himself stupid, nearly overdosing or not using his nebuliser properly and claiming he can’t breathe - all of which he blames on me. I’ve suffered from mental health issues for a long time because of it and truly believe it is my fault because of that.

Last week alone; he was in hospital due to not being able to operate his nebuliser and when I went to see him at my brothers request, his only response was ‘Oh great, the autistic one’ which greatly boosted my mental state over that condition as I’m sure you can tell.

And a few months back, in October, he tried to murder me by burning down the flat he and I were staying in whilst I was asleep. But due to him having passed out from alcohol after, he got a slap on the wrist.

Those are just a few things he’s done that affect me... can anyone give some tips on how to put this behind me? Thank you"
409,I can't feel negative emotions,"Hello, I'm 15 years old and I can't feel negative emotions. I can't feel fear, shame, sadness, loneliness, anger and so on. I tried searching for something like this online, but nothing came up. So I hope someone here knows what is causing this. I'm sorry if this breaks the rules."
410,Unusual situation,"I have no idea what to do. If anyone could pm me I’d really appreciate it. 

I’m fully aware that many of the things I’ve come to believe would be considered delusional by many people. It’s complicated and this is a very short explanation, but I think certain people are reading my mind, that my thoughts are causing awful things to happen, and that I’m being poisoned. I don’t expect any of this to change soon, and I’m powerless. I wish I had someone to talk to.

When I’m alone, and don’t have anything to distract me, I’m incredibly anxious, scared, guilty, and angry. And yet I have perfected wearing a mask of normalcy. On the outside, I look like I’m happy and thriving. I’ve recently been accepted to my dream university, too. The only change is that my grades have slightly dropped. Oddly, I don’t expect this to change- I have a lot of trouble sharing even the most extreme emotions to other people due to issues from my childhood. 

Partly, scared of telling someone about this because I’ll worry they’ll think I’m crazy and my life will irreversibly fall apart. And if the people around me didn’t think I was crazy, they’d hate me, because I’ve hurt many people with my thoughts, and my life would be over. 

Yet I’m also terrified that if I talk to someone, they will think I’m faking symptoms of mental illness for attention. That they’ll figure acting “normal” while having such frightening experiences would literally be impossible.

So the only way I can tell someone about these things and have them not think I’m a terrible person is to consciously make myself look irrational and crazy. I obviously don’t want to appear as though I’ve lost it. Furthermore, by purposefully exaggerating how I feel and making myself seem less functional than I really am, I would actually BE faking symptoms of mental illness. 

All I know is that I absolutely can’t keep living like I am now, bottling everything up. I’m miserable. I have lived like this for nearly 5 months."

I've almost come to the realisation that I just want to do the easiest thing, as little as possible, because I feel lazy now. I'm burnt out. I worked too hard over the last 4 years.

Now what? Does taking a break actually work? I've had 2 weeks off (reading weeks) and I've just been working on the house. It hasn't made me feel any better...maybe the next 3 years will be joyous like the ones I had between my 2 degrees, but I've got a bad feeling they're gonna be horrific."
412,I'm posting this because I need to be really honest with myself right now.,"Two weeks ago I lost my job. Every day since then I have been getting high every day and binge eating on so much food that I really can't afford every day, and isolating from everyone. I am so disappointed in myself. It stops right now. I want to turn this around and I don't know what to do except stop smoking and stop binge eating and see where it goes. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Did you turn it around?"
413,I think I'm losing my mind,"⚠️SELF HARM AND SUICIDE WARNING⚠️

Hi. This is my first post on this subreddit and I'm worried that itll backfire because of stuff my parents and friends have said to me recently.
Basically I'm 15 and according to my parents I'm just melodramatic when they find me holding a blade to my knee or sobbing uncontrollably until I end up feeling numb for days. My friends always call me over dramatic because they all think they know what's going on when in reality they really dont. Even now typing this is making me feel like I'm begging for attention and am making it up because of the stigma around mental health especially within my family. My mother suffers from Bipolar and severe social anxiety so you would think shed understand but no, she just tells me to move on or her favourite line is to tell em to stop crying ot that's enough in a catty tone. I have no one to turn to and this is my last effort of trying to just rant and get it out there. I'm just looking for ways I can handle my health until I'm out in university (I'm from the UK) because the doctors doesnt work my parent constantly talk over me. Sorry this is so long but I have nowhere else to turn rn- Ash x"
414,I'm lost on a downward spiral,"I've had issues with my anger all my life and since my PTSD and anxiety from the military it has only gotten worse. I have been to a few classes for anger management and it didn't help. I have a family and they have all moved out of my house. I need help and I don't know where to turn to because I think don't care anyways. If I had a weapon I would have done something already and honestly don't think people would care anyways since I have heard how people bad talk the victim which is what they are. 

At work, I get irritated easily and usually have to go to constant walks to not tear up my desk. My anti-depressants don't work for the simple fact it is for my depression and the anger is totally different. 

Now my spouse is giving me an ultimatum and I don't know what to do. Everytime we talk seriously, I burst out in rage and yell. I scare everyone, right down to my dog. I don't have anyone else to talk to and I don't want to talk to my parents about it. I really wish I could just end the problem in my own hands because I get reminded of how messed up I am anyways. Maybe I can talk everyone's problem by doing it myself. I have even tried to get other people to do something to me too. I'm just an angry monster that doesn't deserve anyone."
415,I don't want to be here anymore,I just don't want to be here... I want to give up.. I just want to be gone... Everything is fucked..
416,"Depressed and lost my ambition to work, what should I do?","So as a back story, back in high school and college, I was a pretty happy go lucky person with a huge amount of drive and ambition. I did have some social life but it seems like if I wasn’t sleeping, 85% of the time I was studying or working some sort of job. I felt if I wasn’t doing one of those 2 things, I wasn’t moving the needle forward in life.


Then I graduated college in 2018 and was lucky enough to have a job upon graduation. I work at that job for ~7 months. I left the job because it was a very sales heavy job and I am not the best at sales and my boss was somewhat verbally abusive 

This is where my depression started, largely due to failing miserably at my first job. Lucky I had a second job lined up right afterwords. However, at first, it wasn’t the easiest transition into the job as it is in a totally different industry. Thus, in the first few months, I had a lot of failures at the job but now am doing way better.

At the end of 2019, due to the holidays and the amount of vacation days I was able to save up, I ended up being able to have the whole last half of December off. During that time, I went to visit Puerto Rico (where I am originally from) and had this mindset in my head that all I want to do is sit on the beach all day and not work.

This mindset has gotten ingrained so much in my head that I’ve it’s made me wildly lazy at work and depressed. Now all I want to do is just be on vacation mode and not work. 

How can I solve this?"
417,What is the reason with self harming?,"This is a genuine question because im curious. Is it a form self punisher, or do you enjoy the pain. Im not trying to judge anyone."
418,"Suicide hotline said I wasnt a ""Priority""","So this is the first time posting something like this and I'm honestly embarrassed for some reason. 

My bestfriend passed away recently and I've been struggling. The whole community set up a GoFundMe and everyone is mourning, even people who were shitty to him. This makes me mad but w/e.
A few days after he passed I called the 1-800-suicide line or whatever had to google because I've never called last time I just made the attempt without hesitation. The kind man answered but after a few questions like ""Do you have a plan, are you in a safe place, do you have any weapons?"" He said he needed to transfer me over. Ok that's fine. I've been crying almost hysterically for 30 minutes with this poor guy listening. A woman picks up on the transferred line and proceeds to tell me that at this time I'm not a priority and need to hang up and call a local MHMR in the morning to schedule an appointment. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! That is exactly the sort of thing that had I not been so shocked back into my right mind I would have killed myself. I have an appointment at my local MHMR but ITS MONTHS AWAY! It's like a cruel joke that life is playing on me they call and reschedule farther out and I just dont see the point in waiting around for help that I need now. Every route I take to try and get better I'm never taken seriously. I'm a pretty small person and when I'm face to face with other adults I'm continually getting this vibe they dont respect me or see me as a child for some reason. That could all be in my head though. My friends death was just the straw that broke the camel's back in a slew of crap I've been dealing with. Then this. I just dont even know anymore."
419,Do I have a mental health disorder?,"How do i tell? I've keep diving between states of wanting to do things, so I do them, and just being generally sad about everything even if there is nothing wrong. I think that I might be bipolar or something along the lines of that, as on my father's side of the family, him and his dad were bipolar. I've been in that second state lately, and I could really use some tips to help."
420,Pregnant and finally opening up to the idea of psych meds,"So I was raised in states custody &amp; was forced to take all types of different heavy psych meds until I got emancipated at 17 and immediately cut that shit out of my life. I always felt like a zombie. Like the spark in me had left and was never coming back. I always felt they were unnatural and all I needed was some good ole weed. 

Anyways, I’m 22 now and almost 12 weeks pregnant. If anybody has serious mental health problems and has been pregnant before knows that pregnancy is basically mental health on crack!! I’ve been completely spiraling and even almost checked myself in the loony bin voluntarily the other day. Which is not something I would normally do at ALL due to me being institutionalized. 

Now that I’m pregnant, I realize I need to get this shit under control before my baby comes. I hate that I have to lean on pills but whatever. I give up. Crazy wins. Now, they’ve officially diagnosed me with depression, dissociative personality disorder, bipolar and PTSD. (I shot myself in the chest when I was 19 and was super annoyed when I woke up a week later in ICU just to give y’all some sort of outlook on how throwed off I am.)  

Now, with all that being said, does anybody have any recommendations on what medicine worked for them who possibly has the same diagnosis as me? Example: I researched that latuda does wonders with people with JUST depression but will make you extremely manic if you have depression AND bipolar. Also, I’m pregnant so like some baby proof medicine. Idk this is all new to me. I just don’t want to go see my psychiatrist next week completely blind sided. Also, if I can avoid it, I’d rather not be some test guinea pig and have to try a thousand different medications until we find the exact one right for me. 

Thank you for listening."
421,Realised I'm touch-deprived and ruined a friendship by not respecting boundaries: Need help,"Hi,

I am a 25-year-old male that has never been in a relationship and am a general loner kinda guy. Don't have many friends to hang out with and didn't have many girl-friends either. However, I recently made a new girl-friend that is charming, smart and witty and is quite genuinely concerned for me as a good friend.

She pointed out that I am quite clingy and tend to ask her a lot to hold her hand, which annoys her. We hung out thrice now and I've been physically needy, even though I was told that I am exhibiting such behaviour. We went to see a movie last time we hung out and I again asked her to hold my hand and constantly badgered her, like a spoiled brat.

She didn't say anything but later she let me know how she feels unsafe with me, I'm a creep and need to get help. While I thought my motives were pure and not sexual in any way, I did cross a boundary, which should never have happened and ended up deeply hurting her.

I am not sure how to get ahead of this. I've realised what I did was completely wrong and that I ignored all the warning signs, which I never thought is something I would do. I am deeply ashamed of what I did but that won't make things better now. There is some time before I can save enough to get regular therapy, any help would be deeply appreciated.

TLDR; Was being super clingy/physically needy with a friend even though she said not to be, now have almost ruined our relationship and am going for therapy."
422,Completely Lost,"I moved back home from school for the semester so I could take care of my mental health, but things just keep getting worse.  My mom promised me we would find an outpatient program for me but nothing has panned our because it’s either too far away or not covered by our insurance.  I don’t have a job so I have zero responsibilities or my own money.  Everyone in my house is mentally ill in some regard and my dad and sister specifically take very little care in managing it.  This creates a very toxic home environment, people constantly blaming each other.  The house is NEVER clean.  My dad insists we need to put things where they belong but what he doesn’t understand is that he has a hoarding problem and we need to throw a lot of stuff away.  So I’m surrounded by mess and clutter every single day.  I mostly lay in bed as I have no friends in town and the ones farther away are in school or working often.  So I leave the house when I can but I don’t have any real escape.  I sleep 10+ hours every night, often waking up after 1pm.  No matter what I do to try and correct this, nothing can make me wake up earlier, especially since I have nothing to do.  The sun sets here at about 5pm and it’s frigid cold most days so I don’t even have an escape to the outdoors.  I don’t really know what to do or how to get better here.  My suicidality is back and I just want an escape from the pain.  It feels constant and debilitating.  I don’t know how much longer I can fight.  I’m lacking any purpose or drive."
423,Im kinda confused,I wouldnt say i have depression or anxiety because i feel happy and normal 99% of the time but on ocassions i'll just think about certain Past events and how lifes gone and its really nothing serious compared to others and i'll just sit there and cry but the problem is sometimes these emotional outbursts lead to self harm and i dont know if its normal and people go through this often or i need help for it these outbursts tend to happen around once every month
424,A blanket,"Everything I feel seems to be under a really heavy blanket. I can 'feel' somethings but its no where as profound as it used to be. I cant laugh or cry, be upset when something or someone hurts me or even indulge in little moments  of a happy day or event. It just is. Life just is."
425,What's wrong with me?,"I've posted this on a couple different subreddits but it keeps getting taken down. I hope this is ok to post here. I don't know where else to ask. 


I used to be really depressed, and I came out of that feeling like I had to be there whenever someone else was sad or hurt. I'd go out of my way to help my co workers and family if they needed it.


In recent years, Ive had to deal with a really bitchy coworker. I gave her so many chances and didn't retaliate whenever she tried to get me in shit with the boss. She does this to everyone so I tried to not take it personally. It really hurt me though and I would go home and cry, and want to change jobs, knowing I couldnt. I was this strong person at work who at times just randomly started crying and I hated it. I hated being seen like that. I feel like my hatred for her has turned me into a nasty person. That coupled with my relationship with my sister which I feel is very fake. We get on because we're related but we both know we don't really get on at all. She's done so many unforgivable things over the years. I have other siblings but none which have hurt me like she has.


There's still a part of me that will be there for others 100% but then sometimes, and very rarely, I get thoughts of how things could go wrong to people I care about (eg something I could do this second that could ruin something etc) and I don't even want to cause that person any distress. 


My boyfriend is upset all the time because he feels he isn't getting anything from me. I try so hard to try to be the person he wants me to be. Seeing him is getting exhausting because I can't give him what he wants. I love him but find myself faking emotions to either get out of conversations or give him a ""normal"" reaction. I cried the other week just so he would give me a break. I don't feel things like I used to do. All I want is for him to be happy but nothing I do is right.


What's wrong with me? I don't want to be this person. I'm constantly trying to work on myself. I'm going to be 30 in a couple of years. I want to be like all of these strong woman who have a husband, children, a nice house, savings etc. I want to be happy and I can't wait to make my future family happy. It's just the getting there that's the problem. Is any of this normal? I wasted years being depressed. I don't want to waste the rest of my 20s and get to 30 feeling like I wasted what could of been the best years of my life while everyone else my age is successful and happy.


Its late and I'm just feeling very sad typing this because I feel like no one likes me. If you have ever felt something similar, what helped you? How did you become a better person?"
426,"What do you guys do when you dont want do do anything, but you also cant stop thinking?","I tend to either infinitely scroll through the internets or just mindnumbingly play whatever game im already playing that im able to autopilot.

I haven't felt this way for a while, not suicidal, but have a lack of energy or drive to do anything or be me.

428,"Feeling good at school, feeling bad at home","Hi, I'm a 20 y/o college student who goes to a university 3hrs from my home. I'll start saying I always feel good at school because I have great friends and a bf who loves me and have goals in my career. 
But as soon as I go back to my childhood home I get super depressed. Like I'm just here for a 3day weekend and I already feel no motivation to do my assignments or even fucking eat. Everything seems hopeless
I feel frustrated because my family dosnt try to reach out to me at all while I'm at school so if I want any relationship with them at all then I have to come here to see them. I also am not in good financial standing so for my summer break it makes most sense to live at home rent free and work
 

Honestly I can see some obvious reason why I feel this way like having no friends/nothing to do here(small town) and that my mother is a hoarder, and kinda neglectful. I was also starting to become an alcoholic in highschool but i easily stopped once I went to college.

Idk is there some way I can be not depressed in this situation and just get the good money? Or should I just fucking leave and pay rent somewhere. 

Sorry this turned into more of just a rant then anything"

But recently I've started to hate my academic studies, on the journey to work I think about jumping in-front a train some days. But i'm fine once I am there. At home I only end up in arguments, stay in my room and never leave, and of course contemplate if its worth it all. I realized this wan't right so turned to my doctor, who said, and i'm quoting. ""Your probably not depressed, just having a bit of a bad time at the moment, you will be fine."" .

My grand-parents who I live with refuse to listen to me when I try explain i'm not happy and tell me if I drop out of college i'm getting kicked out the house. So i'm screwed no matter what, what do I do???"

437,It is really hard for me to consciously recognize when I am uncomfortable.,"I don’t shout them from the rooftop, but **I have no shame in talking about my feelings.**

**It’s really hard for me to *actualize* my feelings of discomfort.** That means it's hard for me to consciously recognize when I feel uncomfortable. *I would really like to hone this skill.*

I’m not sure if this is alexithymia, but I think it’s related.

EXAMPLE: My friends and I were in the cafeteria once, a janitor came by, and he put his dustpan on the table. He collected some trash and moved on. It grossed me out but I didn’t *actualize* that. Someone else said “wait did he just put that dustpan on the table?” THEN I actualized my discomfort. “Yes! I thought that was weird too.”

**PROBLEM: It hurts my decision making when I fail to identify that I am uncomfortable.** “Listen to your gut when it tells you something is wrong” is hard advice to follow if you don’t know what your gut is saying.

Sometimes I don’t realize that I am uncomfortable, disappointed, ignored, scared, even bored, until I have already made a decision. **After I actualize the feeling, I have no issue speaking up.**

This guy in my bio lab used to ask me all kinds of weirdly personal questions, which made me uncomfortable, but I would just answer them. Say he asked what I did over the weekend. If I told him I watched a movie with my friends, he would ask my friends' names, majors, how I met them, how old they are, and so on. That always felt intrusive but I never actualized that. **One day, another person said “yeah he does that a lot, it’s really weird.” THEN I realized “yes! Oh my God I hate it!! It's weird and I don’t need to answer all his questions.” *UNTIL I ACTUALIZED THAT DISCOMFORT, THANKS TO SOMEONE ELSE, I DID NOT REALIZE I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE, AND I DID NOT KNOW BETTER THAN TO ANSWER THAT GUY'S QUESTIONS*.**

~~By the way, for super trivial things, I can easily identify how I feel. I can easily identify that I don’t like how something tastes…~~ Nope, that’s not true. It took me 21 years to realize I hate eating garbanzo beans. For some trivial things, I can identify how I feel easily. Of course, having the back of your seat kicked on a plane is irritating, and I know this because so many people complain about it.

**This might have something to do with the fact that I come from a home in which feelings usually weren’t expressed openly and freely.**

**If I took a multiple choice test on how I feel, I would get 100%. If I took a short answer test, I might get a B-. My therapist kind of goes through a multiple choice test sometimes with me to get answers.**

""Does Activity X make you scared? Does it make you bored? ...""

""I guess it does scare me a bit.""

""What about it scares you? Is it the other people there? Is it Aspect B? ...""

**If this is something you have experience with, do you have any advice?**

People sometimes compliment me for not complaining. It's not because I'm always really happy. It's because I don't know what I'm unhappy about.

I don't know if this is important, but it's really easy for me to know when I'm happy. I easily identify which activities make me happy, and I instantly know that I want to do them again. The issue is that not everything that doesn't make you happy is bad."

I've never felt this way before. Tonight, something happened with my family, like every night, they grilled me about not being a good contribution to the family, what with me on Welfare and not helping around the house, only sleeping, eating, and scrolling reddit and facebook. The usual.
I text my sister, told her how I've been feeling, how I came across the term ""Sociopath""
How the symptoms lined up exactly how I've been these past few years. But she didnt care. She laughed it off. Called it self diagnosed bullshit. That very second she laughed, it locked my heart up. I'm never talking about this to anyone but this throwaway account.

Here comes the hard part...
Tonight got physical, I wanted to express what I needed to express to my family, but it's been bottled up for so long, that it feels natural to keep to myself. After she begun raising her voice, I hit my sister... I dont know why, but I did. The second I did it, it ""opened my eyes"", if you will.
If I took off tonight, or just ate some pills in the bathroom cabinet, my family's problems will melt away. Sure they'll be sad for a bit, but then they'll grow. Grow to know they didnt need me, that I was just a nuisance.
I have no friends, no close relatives, so there is nothing I'm holding onto, it's just me, my Mother and Sister.

Why does everything I do feel like a ""cry for help"". Why cant I just stay the way I am. I like me. I like that I dont bother anyone.

I have no memory of this; from my perspective it seemed like he attacked me. His side of the story says he was defending himself.

We went into the kitchen. We were fighting. He had me by the shirt front, screaming in my face, and then I blacked out. My memory goes from standing upright, to my head slamming into the kitchen floor with his hands on my wrist and neck. My mind says he handed me the knife and told me to kill myself, and then I threw it away, but according to him I grabbed it and went for his neck. I don't remember doing this!!! 

I'm terrified. I don't know what happened. He was screaming at me all night after I came home later than expected. He told me to give up, to kill myself, that I was a coward and too weak to fight for myself. When we got to the kitchen I was at a breaking point. Could he have driven me to a point of a memory break and violence? Because that isn't me! That isn't me at all! IIm not a violent person, and I never want to hurt him.

I live in Canada and it’s still cold as shit outside so I’m stuck inside doing nothing but thinking. I would go out for a walk at 3 am just to finally be alone but it’s too cold do that comfortably. The triggers and memories are getting worse. I’ve started having bad dreams about being attacked like my dad used to do to me and being molested like I was when I was 12. Right now I feel like I’m going to throw up because I am just anticipating the terrible night I’m about to have again. I’m so tired of everything. People keep telling me that it gets better, but the problem is a part of me doesn’t what to get better. A part of me doesn’t want to be okay with what happened, or to be okay in a world where things like that can happen, and do happen everyday. I’m tired of everyone clinging to the good to distract themselves from the bad. There are people struggling everyday. People, children, being abused everyday. Right now there are probably hundreds of thousands of children being abused right now, and we can’t do shit about it. It’s hopeless. I don’t want to exist in a world where that’s possible. Time after time as a kid I put my trust in people who just pissed it away. I just wanted to be accepted, and they used that against me. What did I ever do to them? People around me don’t seem to understand what it’s like to struggle with PTSD either. I tell them I was molested and I tell them that I avoid relationships and intimacy because of it, and they tell me later that they’re going to get me “finally laid” when we travel to the Dominican in the spring. It’s like they don’t even listen. They don’t even care. They’re living in a world where they aren’t even aware of the evil that happens everyday. They ignore it so easily. But every fucking waking moment for me is spent obsessing over it, and so I am basically constantly being triggered. I feel like I am going insane. I’m always exhausted, never have an appetite. I was 205 just 2.5-3 weeks ago. I’m around 180-185 now. I haven’t done any exercise. In fact, I’ve just sat inside all day and built on minecraft to distract myself. I have spent 10+ hours per day for at least 3 days now just building. When I’m not sleeping or building I am obsessing over the triggers and memories. I want to escape so badly. Just run away from it all. I want to kill every single child abuser alive. I want to slowly strangle every pedophile as I look into their eyes as they die. I fantasize about finding a child being abused just so I can’t save them and beat the ever living shit out of the abuser and comfort them and let them know that they are safe. I just don’t know anymore."

But I’m still living at home as I’m in community college, but I take care of myself and yet she still says I need to get out and live, as if I’m not good enough. So growing up my grandmother was always so mean. We never had parents growing up as my father died when I was 6 and mom left due to drugs; and court related issues. So she was always so controlling, and tried to use us to make herself look good. For example she forces my sister to play piano although my sister hates it. She threatens to take her phone, tv, and all activities out if she quits. And I quote,” if you quit, your life is going to drastically change”. I’m not a religious person, more spiritually driven I would say, but yet she tries to force me to go to church still to this day all because “people are asking about you” seeing the way she acts claiming to be a Christian, has really made me despise Christian people. She is narcissistic and that’s obvious. She walks around bitching, and never owns up to doing any wrong. Just tonight she’s been walking around spitting bullshit about how everyone is always against her, and nothing she ever does is right. And for a while all of this made me feel guilty, and I hated myself. But that’s out the window I’ve realized that it’s all a mind game she’s playing. She always has to have things done her way, and tries to make people feel like shit. Yet she’s the nicest person in the world when people are around, but in the dark she’s an evil witch, and I say that with no regrets because it’s the truth. Butt I’m extremely worried about my sister, she forces my sister to wear what she wants to wear, and breaks out into a screaming match if she doesn’t. She tries to control every single aspect of her life. She has read spiritual books I have in my room, and told the entire family that I’m “questioning Jesus” which is 100% not true. I believe in a god, but that it’s not what we’re being told. If someone knows anything about abuse could they let me know if this is some sort of mental, or emotional abuse? Or just a narcissistic parents."
442,"Mental, Monday, Myself.",#SelfCare
443,I'm suppose to go to the hospital,"I told my psychiatrist last Friday that my hallucinations have gotten a lot worse over the past few weeks. He wants me to go to the hospital he works at for the next weekend for observation and new meds. I work monday-friday so I can't really take time off work. I'm kinda scared because i've never been admitted to a hospital before for mental issues. Thing is that the local hospital doesn't have a designated psych ward, the city I live is pretty small \~30,000 people, so I'm really not sure what I'm in for. A psychiatrist comes in for a few hours everyday for people who end up in ER.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really even too sure why he thinks I should go to the hospital, I'm not suicidal, I'm still working and I'm not like panicking or extremely bothered by the voices. The voices are pretty much constant at this point but I've had them for over 2 years now so it doesn't bother me too much anymore.

I think I'll call the hospital on Thursday and see what I'm allowed to bring, hopefully I can bring my tablet with movies on it because sitting in a silent room to have drugs pushed on me while being watched to see how crazy I'am sounds like a pretty shitty way to spend a weekend."
444,I want to be back to normal...,"My life has been rough, I'll just give a little back story because I don't have time.. I had multiple dads growing up, my stepdad used to hit me for little to no reason. My mom wasn't really around in my early teens, so I was flunking school. She sent me to live with my real father I had just met at 14, he had cancer so it was an emotional rollercoaster, and he treated me like absolute shit. I turn 18, and I decide I was put through hell so I'm going to have fun, I made some friends, as always they were outsiders and got into some bad stuff. It started with Molly and ecstacy, then graduated to Dilaudid (like morphine), then heroin and shrooms. Despite my friends being bad for me I've never in my life had a closer connection with the few people I did back then, we were like blood brothers, I was very much dependent on their friendship to be happy. I overdosed ~4 years ago and have since been clean.. I've been absolutely miserable because I had to move far away to get clean, I haven't been able to make new friends and I'm always, constantly uptight, unhappy, and miss my old friends like crazy, but it's not a the same because I can't see them, and talking on Facebook just isn't the same. I just want to feel that happiness again, those 3 or so years I had of complete happiness, I wasn't a nervous wreck, and I had a little group of friends. I'm honestly really unhappy with my life, and all I do is think about the past."
445,Living with parents at 24 makes me have so much anger towards myself. How can I be more at peace with myself?,"Unfortunately, I switched career paths after finishing my first degree at school. I work my butt off constantly between school and work, taking out minimal loans. Even with that, I feel like I’m frowned on, especially in my hometown, which is largely blue collar (went right into the workforce). This whole thing makes me feel so down and like shit. I told myself I wouldn’t date until I move out too. I am not really fond of my family either. It makes me want to do die knowing I still have a 1.5-2 years left to finish school and pay off all my debts. I’m really mot happy with where I am at. I’m not sure what to do besides suck it up."
446,How can I as a 17 year old brother help my 17 year old sister?,"I was in my room tonight, and I heard my parents confront my sister about how distant she has been. After a few minutes, she burst into tears and said ""I hate life!"" How can I best be supportive without pushing too much?"
447,I'm feeling some confusion - just letting my thoughts out,"I'm feeling the strongest urge to not post this, so I might delete.

I can't recall what day exactly this ""switch"" occurred, but all of a sudden I went from ""positive and forward-thinking"" to ""feeling constantly empty and having recurring thoughts about no future - like not living.""

For some background, I've had diagnosed anxiety and depression before, but I stopped taking medication for it four years ago, since they both went away. I've been dealing with contamination OCD, however, within those four years, and still am. My confusion is stemming from whether this is resulting from just senioritis, a year-and-a-half long bout of feelings of burnout, or a potential relapse.

What's really making me uneasy is the sudden frequency to which I'm imaging really violent scenarios from the slightest of irritations - like physically destroying a room to clawing my face to crashing my car. A few days ago, I got so pissed off in traffic that I accelerated to go 52 mph in a 25, all the while telling myself to stopstopstop. It only lasted a few seconds, but I scared myself.

I don't know where I'm going with this, but I'm afraid to mention stuff because with other issues, I have seen the way everyone doesn't believe me, so I end up trying to emphasize(?) my point, which makes me look completely fake. Damn."
448,Constantly feeling paranoid,"I'm constantly paranoid, feeling like there's always something that hates me. When I'm alone it's a constant feeling that I'm being watched by something and when I'm with people it's a constant thought that they are judging me. Every time I hear someone laugh, I think it's because they're judging me, the things I do, the things I say or how I look. It makes me think about what they might dislike about me and as I'm very self conscious it makes me feel bad about myself. I'm constantly uncomfortable and it sometimes keeps me up at night."
449,I am the opposite of lonely and I need some advice,"Hi! First time poster here. 
I live in a place where all of the employees of a resort live together in a staff  accommodation. There are about 40 people that live here and I have lived here for about 5months. I have been drinking almost everyday since being here and doing at least one drug once a week (limed to coke, molly, shrooms, LSD) I am always with people and it’s becoming overwhelming for me, but I can’t stay away. I am on antidepressants (cipralex) for anxiety and depression and I feel as though my brain can’t handle all of this substance but I am easily influenced by others. 

So I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what you did. I love the place I’m living as it’s amazing and these people are like family, therefore do not want to just get up and leave. But I feel as though my social battery has drained and I don’t want anyone thinking I’m staying away on purpose. Any advice on how to cope with something like this would be greatly appreciated"
450,Has anyone had EMDR therapy before?,"I've just started EMDR therapy after a diagnosis of PTSD and BPD/EUPD. The waiting list in my area for DBT is 3 years, so I've been referred for EMDR in the meantime. So far it's been incredibly difficult and I'm hoping it'll be worth it. 

Basically I was wondering what other people's experiences were, and whether you found it helpful."
451,Imagining a very harsh and strong screaming sounds,"So, imagine yourself sitting reading something or doing anything and suddenly you unwillingly starts imagining someone who is screaming while he or she is angry.. and I cant control it till it stops.. sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable, sometimes very nervous. 

It is occurring to me once or twice a month.

it is worth mentioning that i am a person who hates living with noises, loud sounds. alot.. and I mean literally ALOT.

A strange thing to post since I suffered or suffering no mental health issues whatsoever.. so I said let me give it a try here in Reddit perhaps someone knows what the hell is this strange thing?

Thanks in advance."
452,"I started self harming again, and now it’s becoming a habit","I’m finding that I like hitting myself. It feels like some sort of self punishment, or a way to relieve anger I can’t otherwise get rid of. The bruises are easy to lie about and satisfying to look at. I don’t want anybody I know to find out about it but I also don’t want to stop. Therapy isn’t currently an option, because I’m dependent on my parents allowing me to go to appointments (they don’t want me missing school), the school resources aren’t reliable (plus we are having legal issues with the school), and the online resources seem bleak. It seems like hurting myself till things get better is the best option."
453,I'm really stressed and I think I've become at risk with dangerous scenarios and situations regarding the places I frequent. I drink alcohol on medication and recently I've really been effected by negativity and bullying. I just want to be safe. Tips for avoiding stress and negativity?,Any tips for avoiding stress and negativity?
454,Being so alone with all of this is kind of excruciating,There's been so much bad in my life lately and it feels like it's gonna topple me over. Just this heavy weight on my chest all the time. I have no one. I'm so alone. I don't know how to be alone with all of this but I don't know how to connect with anyone either. Everything that comes out of my mouth is just trauma garble. I just scare people away. I feel like i'm going sincerely crazy again from being so alone. It's not healthy. Especially with all of this. It's just too much.
455,I hate being sad all the time...,"I’m so unhappy it’s getting tiring and exhausting. I feel like I never had an happy moment in my life or usually it’s temporary. I’ve been sad for a long time, but as I’m getting older it’s getting worse. I’ve isolated myself, I’m more quiet, I hang out myself, I like my own company, I have dark thoughts, I cry a lot more now, I hate myself even more. I don’t like talking about my feelings because no on really listens or understands or cares enough for what I’m going through. I’ve been pretty obvious about my state and the signs become obvious. But I want to find happiness again, but I don’t enjoy doing things anymore or things I used to like. I’m seventeen and feel like my teenage life is being wasted because I’m sad. I can’t even try or pretend to be happy anymore. It’s draining, I even miss school because I hate seeing people or doing things or even being talked to. I don’t enjoy life and often imagine how life would be if I can just be happy. Is it my fault?"
456,I can’t cry,"I feel so numb all the time and I don’t know why, it’s not that I’m all of a sudden a lot happier, what happened was: I cry all the time but then at one point a few months ago it just stopped out of nowhere. I’m still sad but I can’t force out tears; it’s so frustrating, I feel as if I cant feel emotions anymore and I’m finding  it hard to connect with people as much as I used to be able to. Does anyone know why this is?"
457,sharing this with all of you first,"After years and years of self harm, suicidal thoughts, intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, and my mental health affecting how I function as a student, worker, and organizer, I am now finally taking the step of seeking professional help. For years, I’ve been dreading asking for help, thinking they would not validate how I’m feeling to the point that even I would question myself. Am I just being lazy? Is this depression? Am I having a panic attack? This will pass away in a few months anyway so I just have to handle it, those kind of thoughts hindered me to reach out. But last night, I filled out an intake form and in a few days I will hand it in. I am happy and proud of myself. I just want to share this ❤️"
458,Deteriorating,I can feel myself going crazy but I feel like I have no control over it. I really think this is the worst state my mental health has ever been in and that I won't get better. It's just scary &amp; sad to be dealing with. I really don't like being mentally ill :(
459,I've lost who I am,"This isn't right, it feels like a delusion. Everything feels out of place. The things that used to ground me aren't working. Everything feels fake. I don't want to do anything anymore, how do I even know if what I'm doing is real."
460,I really need help right now,I'm having a lot of anxiety and it feels so horrible. I really need someone to chat with. I feel so alone.
461,I feel like I have some sort of mental illness,"I haven’t been the same for a couple of months now and I really need some help trying to narrow what I might have (or maybe I don’t have anything at all). I’ve been becoming way more self conscious which might be low self esteem but I’ve never had this type of behavior happen. It just sort of appeared ever since I started high school. Another thing that has frequently occurred is random depressive episodes. I get extremely sad to the point of crying for no apparent reason. And when I try to figure out what’s making me sad I forget, I just can’t remember anything before that point, which leads me to my next issue, bad memory. I’ve always had great memory I can play songs on my saxophone without even looking at sheet music. So when I started forgetting things that happen the other day, vocabulary and my ability to think fast that just made me mad at myself. So this is what leaves me to believe I have some sort of mental illness so whoever took the time to read this please leave a comment to narrow down my search for what I may have."
462,"I sometimes get horrible mood swings, I go from being normal to having suicidal thoughts then shortly after I am are fine?","I just don't know wtf! What the fuck is wrong with my stupid brain! WHAT?!  My depression started 1 year ago. I am on meds. (Zoloft, Zyprexa, Buspar which I just started and Methylphenidate for ADHD)

Typically, become depressed and get suidical thoughts at night, every night. But tonight I was fine, then I think what I was watching on YT triggered it. I started to cry and have suidical thoughts, and less than an hour later I fine?! 

What is wrong with me? I don't think bipolar b/c no mania nor elevation in mood. 

Got ADHD, GAD and depression btw"
463,I don't wanna die I'm just tired of living,I'm not depressed im just so bored with the repeating tasks of life and I want to see so badly what happens next. I figure there isnt all too much that'll change if I'm gone. Like I said before I'm tired with waiting for what happens after. Even if there is a God he sure isnt making taking it easy on me down here. Overall I'm scared of my thoughts as if I leave and there is nothing there it will have been a wasted life. Thank you for any advice you may have.
464,Long ramble post about my feeling lonely,"This my numerous attempt to write this post. I can't seem to find the right words to express what's going in my head, without rambling that is. Maybe that means I've got so much on my mind?

I feel really alone. I don't have many friends, like I count them on one hand I bet. Even then, I feel like we aren't that close. I'm 25, and my friends are similar in age. I know that as people get older and get more involved in life, they tend to become more distant, so I don't hold it against them at all. But it just seems to me that they are perfectly fine with moving on through life without me in it, and it just hurts.

It hurts so bad, like the worst pain I've felt. I'll try and text them throughout the day, with no response. I offer to hang out for go out somewhere and no one answers. We'll go weeks without saying any words, and I just don't know what to do. I don't socialize well and make friends rarely. 

I guess the whole point of this post is to ask how to deal with this loneliness? Or maybe I just want to get this off my chest and I don't have any other way of doing it? Idk I just feel like shit everyday from the heavy loneliness I feel.."
465,Coping strategies for anger?,"LPrior to just about 20 minutes ago, I was pretty secure in my coping methods. I deal with intense violent flashes where I am overcome with the urge to harm others, and sometimes intense self hatred. While I haven’t acted on these urges ever before, I have begun to “twitch.” Sometimes after I am very emotional my body just moves in ways I don’t expect. I haven’t been too bothered by this as this only happens in private areas (where I get emotional) but just about 20 minutes ago I scratched myself on the neck. I was just walking toward my bedroom when suddenly I lifted my hand up and scratched the back of my neck hard enough to break the skin. I hadn’t been aware I was moving until I felt the pain, and I was very surprised. I’m assuming this is just me expressing my frustrations, but I cannot let it get anymore out of hand. Is there anything I can do (other than seeking professional help) to keep myself under control? I do not want my family or friends to be concerned."
466,"Been having a real negative view on life lately, need some advice","I attempted suicide a few moths ago and went to a mental hospital for a couple weeks. That experience helped me have a better perspective on life itself, at least in terms of accepting ending your life is not the route to go. 

Since then, I’ve felt myself beginning to dread events of talking to people, even my own family. I usually sit in my room by myself when I’m not at work. I don’t do things with my family and don’t really care to better myself either by working out or starting a hobby. 

I just started taking Lexapro and have been on Latuda, a mood stabilizer for a few months. I personally don’t notice any change in my mood other than it not being well usually. 
 
I guess I’m just looking for advice on how I can approach life in general that will help my mood and outlook on life improve. Thanks"
467,A friend said I should say this,"So what I’m going to do is describe my personality and my character and have you guys who know more about this to tell me if I have any mental issues

Okay so I’m the type of person to put others  wrote myself. I will talk to people and help them through there problems and yet I feel scared to ask people for help with mine. I feel scared to ruin relationships by telling them about my actual mental state. I value their feeling over my own and most times I just ignore myself completely. I will bond with someone and feel like they don’t share the same feelings very easily and get discouraged to continue the relationship. Idk what else to say.

I’m never really anxious and I never feel the need to hurt myself in any way but my friend said I act everyday in a way that isn’t normal"
468,Disassociative personality disorder,"Is it possible for a person suffering with DID to be 1) highly successful 2) aware, at least part of the time, that they have the disorder, and 3) be able to sense or know when a different personality is preparing to take over?

470,Having self-love but not making excuses,"So I’m really trying to figure this out. I’ve struggled hard completing a degree and with work attendance and with responsibilities to my family. I need to do better and get better. One hand, I want to factor in that I have a mental illness and that’s a disability. So it’s understandable I haven’t always done so well. But in order to respect myself, I feel like I need to finish what I start (like my degree) and not miss work on bad mental health days/during hypersomnia. Above all, I cannot excuse it if my mental illness symptoms negatively effect my son. I feel like a waste of space for ways my sons needs haven’t been met &amp; am hyper-critical of that. How do I force myself to change, but keep my peace about the past. Like there’s no way around it. I need to do better for my child, even if my mental illness feels like a 100 ton weight. I don’t know how to feel or what to do from here. I’m staying med compliant but still have some of the symptoms that have orchestrated crashes in the past. I’m so hoping for a better med solution or life-saving epiphany that resolves all this for good."

473,Can Anxiety Cause Long-Term Memory Loss?,"Evening all,

I’ve been dealing with a ton of anxiety since late June, and it seems it’s been impairing how I perceive my past (months ago, 2 years ago, 4 years ago, etc)

For me, I’m able to remember most short term memories and tasks (what I did a couple days ago, what I did at work this morning, etc.) but I have difficult remembering long term memories (a couple months ago, 3 years ago, my childhood). I can remember the outcome of events such as vacations from years ago, but I can’t remember detail as well as I used to. Please keep in minds that I’m 22. It never used to be like this, but after a traumatic event that happened back in June I have difficult remembering what I did within this time span, and it seems I have trouble trying to remember memories from years ago. Some other symptoms besides memory and anxiety are derealization/depersonalization, I don’t feel like myself anymore 

Yes, I’ve scheduled to see a psychologist. However, I’d like to know if anyone else has experienced long-term memory issues too from anxiety. I do not think I’m depressed. 

Is it like this for anyone else? Any feedback would be appreciated!"

475,"29 Year old guy here, Can I ask for help?","Thanks for Clicking here, I am not sure where to go and I feel like maybe you can point me in the right direction.   
This might be long, but I need I think I need real help so the more I share the better right?  
I grew up in an abusive home, My father was a drunk, He beat me and my mother more days than he didn't.  
I was always scared to come home but I also hated being at school because my teachers always treated me like I was a problem.  
I acted out and never paid much attention in class because it was always hard for me to follow the lessons and I liked to daydream of a better place.  
I was never offered special classes but I always felt learning was harder for me than other kids.   
Over the years I escaped into fantasy through Books, Video games, and Anime or Movies.  
I always felt a scene of dread anytime i was not able to escape with media.  
I used to lash out in anger as a teen and got in lots of fights in and out of my home.  
I used to cry as a response to any strong emotion i felt, even anger or loneliness.   
My first memory of wanting to end my life is almost my strongest memory, My face was pressed against a dirty tarp on my childhood homes kitchen floor (my dad had ripped up the floor and not gotten around to replacing it.) while my fathers boot pressed against my head, he was calling me stupid and a ""faggot""... I remember thinking that i wished my head would just pop so it would all be over.  
I was still in elementary school.  


I felt sad a lot after that, I had a hard time talking to people or making new friends.  
I spent a lot of time reading or doing more things to escape into my head over the next few years.  


I finally moved out at the age of 16.  
I ran away, I got a job, I dropped out of school.  


I lived with friends and on the streets until I got an apartment with a girl.   
I managed to survive and start a life away from my family.  
During these years I had nightmares of my abuse.  
I barely ever slept because or them.  
I never grew past my need to escape, While the abuse was gone I never stopped feeling sad or helpless.  


It must have been hard for the people i was close to, I would share my suicidal thoughts often, sometimes as little ""jokes"" and sometimes to vent...  
I realize now I must have made them feel trapped and guilty by sharing these thoughts.   


I am 29 now, and the last few years have gone by in a flash.  
I kind of just stopped paying attention.  
I live alone and have very few friends.  
I live across the country from where i grew up in order to distance myself from memories.  
I've lost interest in my hobbies.  
I've lost touch with myself.  
I don't feel sad anymore, No anger, Nothing.  
I cant cry, I sleep 10+ hours a day.  
Sometimes I go weeks without doing laundry, cleaning my apartment, or even brushing my teeth.  


I've gotten fat, I used to be so skinny.  
I have Gingivitis, I used to be proud of my teeth.  
My hair is a long frizzy unkempt mess, I used to love my hair.  


The worst part is I know I need to go to the dentist, to get a hair cut, to eat better...  
But i just can't do it, Its like someone else is making my decisions now and i am just along for the ride, I just get to watch myself rot into nothing.  


I can't motivate myself to do anything, i can barley peel myself out of bed in the morning.   


I used to think I was depressed, but Now maybe I feel like its more than that.  
I most of the time just feel like I am on auto pilot, like I am just sitting in the cockpit behind my eyes watching as my body preforms the bear minimum tasks to survive.   


I just want to feel something again, I don't need to be happy, I just want to be able to at least cry again.  


I am sitting here tonight next to piles of trash, having eaten a whole pizza to myself wanting to feel something.  
I want to cry, I want to feel bad for becoming what I am, I want to be angry.  
I cant.   


I am writing this in hope that someone can tell me what is wrong and what i need to do to fix this...  
But the truth is I could get the perfect answer, I could get a step by step guide on ""how to fix my life"" and somehow I know i would just keep living this Autopilot life... because I am not in control anymore.  


Sorry for the long nonsense post, reading it back its almost like reading something someone else in my head wrote.  
Like these are things that have happened to me and thoughts iv'e had, but it feels so detached from me.  


Anyways thanks for reading, I hope I can get some advice, I hope even more I can try to take it to heart."
476,For anyone that reads this,How are you today? Did you drink water. Eat something good. Do something fun? If not its ok. If you're in a bad spot mentally and need someone to talk to put it in the comments! I'm here for you all
477,A start,"
So here's me reaching out
 
The hardest part for to start improving myself, is my issue with connection. I can't for the life me trust that anyone would want to know me.  I hate so many things about myself that I ruin most relationships, even more so recently. 

I don't trust anyone, at least not fully, I just can't comprehend why anyone would want me in their life. 

I have never actually believed a compliment and just play it off, I'm good at wearing my mask. Compliments to me  just feel like a lie, someone's sympathy telling me things to make me feel better. No at all real or true, and I can't shake it. 

I never believe them! If I hate myself why wouldn't everybody else. To me that's my biggest issue. 

Recently I've had somethings in my head that has made this worse. 

For the most part I've burned all the bridges I've built and told all the people who think they care about me l, that I need a break as a lie. I just wanna run away, and start over someone else......it's harder everyday. 

I know it's a trivial thing to deal with compared to the world ar large.....but I'm scared. 

I don't see a way out, and as much as I am prideful and hate the thought of asking for help. 

I know its selfish and idiotic to want someone to save you but, here I am praying for someone to really connect no matter hard I push them away. 

(I'm just venting, no one needs to save me)"
478,I feel like crying when i talk to anyone that's superior/an authority,"I always feel like crying when i talk to someone whos more superior/has an authority than me. This counts teachers, parents, heck even sometimes my upperclassmen, anyone who has authority(?) If that makes sense.

I only wrote here because it happened recently when i tried to ask my teachers for a specific teacher and he wasn't in the teacher's room. They told me (very politely and kindly) to look for them in another class. But even so the urge to cry was there.

I really dont understand why, the urge just comes when i start talking to them. This has been going on for as long as i can remember and now im in 10th grade in highschool. I feel embaressed because when i was a kid i thought ""oh it would just go away when i grow up"" but- here we are.

I do notice that i ONLY have the urge to cry when they start talking about me. Specificly when they start  critiquing me. I feel frustrated because i know they mean no harm and they're trying to help me, but i cant help but feel guilty and have the urge to just- burst out crying.

So far i have had times when i just straight up cry but the more i get older, the more i try and learn to surpress these feelings by bitting my tounge, try to distract myself from the conversation, and so on. Most of the time i would just end up with watery eyes and people asking me ""what's wrong?""

I never really told anyone this problem (exept my parents but thats because they notice how i start having watery eyes when i talk to those people) because it's embarassing. How come i still feel like crying when someone tries to help me? Am i really that sensitive? Even when i know and understand clearly that it's okay? Can someone explain why i act like this?"
479,How hard is it dealing with a break up whilst having depression?,"
I have a friend who is kinda reclusive and I only learned via iMessage, I ask briefly how he was since he seemed out of it in class but he says he's okay. I sorta know his job hunt isn't going all that well either but my attempts to ask / suggest something have been left on read. It's been about a week or so since I learned about it but I'm wondering if I should call or just take it as a sign to leave him alone, as I'm typically not the initiator and a majority of my friend's are paired up/never really had to console or 'experience' seeing someone go through a breakup so I'm not exactly sure what to do without crossing a line of uninterested vs too pushy."
480,Is it normal to dissociate after consensual sex?,"Me and my boyfriend have ""sex"". We just do foreplay because I want to wait for marriage for the real thing.

I've been sexually assulted in my past. It wasn't bad considering people were actually raped, but none the less I was mildly traumatized. I like to think I've grown past it.

I love this man to the moon and back and forever, and we're waiting until we're older to get married. So for now don't have real sex. When we do play around it's the best time ever, but part of me regrets it because at the end of day it's practically sex. I still consent and I still love every bit of it. He's my first sexual partner because none of my other partners were willing to have sex since it was early in the relationship and then we just never worked out and broke up.

After we mess around I tend to dissociate and not really be that responsive. It's like all of a sudden I've fallen into an abyss. I'm not actively regretting or feeling guilty. I feel nothing and just can't interact that much with him. Is this normal? Is this dissociation? Is it because of the ""sex""?.

This occurred to me after we didn't have ""sex"" on Valentines Day because we just wanted to cuddle. He's never seen me this perky or happy around him and I'm not sure if it just happened to be a good mental health day or because we didn't have ""sex"". Please help!

TL;DR: am I weird for dissociation after engaging in consentual foreplay with my soulmate for life?"
481,LAST NIGHT AT THE AQUATIC CENTRE / EGOS AND ANXIOUS MATES 15TH FEB 2020," 

LAST NIGHT AT THE AQUATIC CENTRE /

EGOS AND ANXIOUS MATES

15TH FEB 2020 

okay, so last  we went on our fortnightly trip to the aquatic center, since the begining of the season when i was at the hostel and i met these doodes weve been coming here since. 

So any ways were at the pools were flipping and jumping having fun, 

(im gunna do my best to explain the reason of this note without over dramatising it and will do my best to write down those current thoughts and emotions of the subject last night)

and then another one of our mates jedd rocked up with his mate that none of us had met before and we were kinda like whos this dude but it wasnt really like that, but he was cool.

Then another mate of ours rocked up and he was by himself, hes a lifty and the boys i was with know him abit better then i do but im still friends with him but its kinda still in those early stages were he isnt really his full self around me and its not quite as %100 as the circle of friendship as what normally ends up being.

so then another one of the dudes we know from work shows up and this dude knows everyone but cause he isnt a lifty im probaly the closest with him cause our departments are the closes at work ive crossed paths with him the most and we get along pretty good.

and this dude was with a few of his mates which id never met before and i dont think anyone else had, and this is were im going with this whole note…

and that is that with these new guys that noone had met before for us the boys that were already at the pools its kinda like we dont know one another good enough to introduce ourselves to these new dudes and even if we did i feel like all of our EGOs are and were to big to say “hey fellas im aaron” nice to meet you.

but no we all sat around few and far between ourselves in such a confined space and swimming in the same pool and using the same diving board, within the 3 other times people showed up to the pool while we were there, although we KNOW ONE another but its like we dont actaully know anything about one another.

there was one of our mates which i really noticed and we was standing/swimming away from the main pack of laughs and bickering by himself watching us jump, and although i was swimming and doing my best to mingle with everyone i felt and used to feel like that to like that was me not to long ago but ive grown and learnt from that place to were i am now.

and this individaul is a dude who ive watched come to canada in the past few months, hes a dude that had never really done drugs before like hes a straight edged dude around my age and ive kinda watched him sort of go/get abit anxious since the time ive met him and while hes been in canada, and i know exactly why hes begining to look/feel this way and that is….

DRUGS, hes come to a place surrounded by drugs and party scene, and has found himself being caught in those nights were you take a few caps and other people are to and you all feel the same amazing way and you feel so much love for one another and just that amazing feeling MDMA gives you.

but then you wake up the next day feeling abit scatteerd, and those nights keep going on and on and on,

until you find yourself looking abit anxious and abit seperated from the crowds leaving me to examine you and to write a note about you, because i know these feelings and emotions all to well, so much i can see it and i know that feeling!

so if i can and i will help these indivauls through those days of anxiousness and hiding behind a smile on there face were in reality they feel abit off, but the EGO of the adulencent male is to strong to stop and ask for help.

and that right there ladies and gentleman is the begining of sucidal thoughts and mental health!

\#SPEAKOUT"
482,OCD overload,"OCD taking over me

I just feel like no one gets me. No one understands the daily battle inside my head everyday. No one understands why I do the things I do. I know I look crazy and sound crazy but I can’t help it. My mom will say things that may sound like good advice to her, but in reality if helps me in no way. I feel so alone. 

All of my sibling go through physical diseases and I feel like they think I have it good. One sibling has no idea that I even have OCD and Trich. I think that they think I have it good but in reality I’m suffering inside everyday. Sometimes I feel like my parents forget that I have the things I do. 

I just feel done. OCD is literally consuming me at this point. It keeps getting worse. I dread doing anything because my OCD will get in the way. 

I feel so misunderstood. Like a complete lunatic. Let me clarify that I don’t want to die or hurt myself, but it’s just so hard living."
483,Depression linked with gut health in several scientific studies," 

Recent studies show that the intestinal microbiome (also known as the gut flora) is related to depression, at least partially: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780009/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6780009/)

&gt;MDD  is a multifaceted mental disorder characterized by a dysfunction of   neurochemical, neuroendocrine, immune and metabolic systems. The   microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional network linking the central   and enteric nervous systems through the same neural, immune and   metabolic routes that are dysregulated in depression.  Therefore,  gut-brain axis abnormalities in depressed patients may, at  least  partly, account for the symptomatic presentations of depression.  This  review highlights how metabolites modulated by the intestinal   microbiota can influence mood through their direct action on central   receptors, through activation of peripheral receptors on neural, immune   or neuroendocrine pathways, and through epigenetic regulation of  histone  deacetylation or DNA methylation.

Some  antidepressants present antibacterial effects that could be related to  their effectiveness for MDD treatment.  Conversely, some antimicrobials  present antidepressant effects. There is still a lot more to be  researched and discovered on this topic.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27744123](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27744123)

Therefore,  as annoying as it can be, when nutritionists recommend us to work with a  naturopathic doctor, we might want to abstain from dismissing them as ""quacks"".

I understand  your struggles, as I have also dealt with episodes of depression,  generalized anxiety and severe OCD throughout the past years. I'm merely  posting this to raise awareness, so please don't be offended or  anything of that nature. God bless!"
484,"My Ex went into a fury last night, we tussled and argued and she is in jail now...","I am scared for her. She has had mental health issues for a long time. She struggles with inhalant addictions and suicidal tendencies.

I met her when I was at a low point. I’ve personally been in a malaise for the better part of a decade and she was kind to me, understanding. She would become furious that I was so undermotivated and depressed and her anger would run wild. Calling me names and belittling me if I ever voiced a concern or asked her why she was being negative. It just seemed like she couldn’t rein her rage in. Her mother was abusive and she learned about inhalants from her. She won’t talk to or be friendly with anyone and the polarity she swings from highs to lows about even little things. Sometimes her rage seemed to be a different thing entirely then her. I think I told myself that most times after she’d belittle me. That I could be strong and patient but it just became insurmountable. I have done a lot of self evaluation, sought counseling and everyone says to just let her go. 

Obviously with her being arrested I can’t imagine things will ever be the same. I didn’t call the police, she and the neighbors did. I am left alone in an apartment I can barely afford, I was just laid off, and my whole focus was on us. We made travel plans in March to go visit friends of mine in Atlanta. I fought so hard to keep some semblance of respect for myself and not shut her out. I am writing this because I don’t know what to do. It just happened last night and while writing this is the first time I’ve been able to cry at all. Old habits of disassociating when I am treated cruelly makes this all the harder.  I just feel to blame and loathe the thought that I couldn’t be better.

She called me from jail just to ridicule me and belittle me more. She blamed me and I feel guilty because maybe if I didn’t push back or tell her to stop calling me names, maybe she wouldn’t be having such a terrible time. Her whole life seems littered with tragedy and I know in my mind that I am not capable of helping her in the ways she needs but I am the first person to befriend her in 3 years. I treated her like my kin. I miss her and I am happy to be able to write this and work through my feelings.  

I can hear the cliche truths: “you aren’t to blame, don’t beat yourself up. There are plenty of people who will treat you better. Work on loving yourself.”

I’ve never been good at that which is why I feel like I failed at loving her. I was thinking about visiting her in jail tomorrow but I know that’s foolish. I just don’t know who else to tell all my dumb quips to. To discuss our favorite shows, or politics. To hold in my arms when they are having a bad dream. I didn’t get a lot from her and that’s what I need to learn. My worth. But tonight I just feel worthless because it was never going to work the way I dreamed."
485,"how to deal with the result of years of isolation, anger issues &amp; binge eating","I don't have the best english but I have it's still readable.

19M

I've been quite isolated from the outside world and people my age for about 5 years now and was probably more awake at night than at day in that time. It all started after getting social anxiety from getting bullied  even longer ago which also resulted in me developing IBS. Over the time I also developed some food intolerances which just further on withhold me from normally spending time outside and socialize. I've been spending my time playing video games and a big part of that were first person shooters in which I have gained so much anger and frustration over the years that I have never let out. All of that turned me into an insecure and easily aggravated person in a way, that I have become afraid of myself. In the last few months, i have started to get thoughts where i badly hurt (to put it mildly)my loved ones, the first time it happened it was a morning after spending another night alone in my room, it made me so afraid that i couldn't even leave my room because I'd be afraid to actually see someone I've had thoughts about. Overall, I'm noticing how my mental health decreases, social, mental and moral barriers disappearing and I'm feeling almost no sympathy or empathy for others. I was depressed for weeks when the isolation started and pornography addiction has also been a problem for a long time. I barely enjoy life anymore, I had some previous attempts to change my life, but it all ended quickly, i feel like I'm in a cycle of my thoughts. My physical and mental health is what always bring me down when wanting to change. Thoughts like I will never be fully healthy (physically) or potentially one of my bad thoughts becoming reality, demotivate me to a point where I just want to lay in bed forever so that I will never be harm for anyone. I eat out of bored and frustration to the point where I force myself to finish foods. Also I can't focus or sit still for a long time, which makes what I still enjoy the most (playing singleplayer video games) almost impossible. I know that I probably need professional help but visiting a therapist or going to a clinic is the absolute last thing I would want to do as long as I still have some what of a clear mind."
486,i can’t feel anymore.,"ever since 2018 i’ve been struggling with numbness. it has only gotten worse overtime and i’m not sure what to do anymore. let me clarify this right now, i am in therapy, so i am getting help for it. 

recently, i’ve realized that i feel nothing for my cat. i raised my cat. i bottle-fed her when she was just a week old. she is almost always with me, yet i feel nothing for her. i used to feel warmth towards her and i’d even get emotional over her. i loved her like she was my child. 

tonight i realized that i feel nothing towards my mom. we’ve had our issues and she doesn’t really act like a mom, more like a sister. at times it feels like i’m the parent even. i don’t talk to her and i tend to not care when she is talking to me. i used to care since my sibling would be rude to her. now that my sibling has been gone for a few years, i’ve slowly become less and less attentive towards her. i’m only 19, so my “i hate mom” phase shouldn’t be emerging, right? it’s not even that i hate her. i just can’t find it in me to care. 

i don’t even care about creating music anymore. i recently bought an expensive guitar and i can’t bring myself to play it. i made an appointment with an instructor for this week and i’m hoping it’ll help me, but i also hate the thought of my money going to waste. 

i can’t get close to anyone. i drop people. i can’t make connections. i’m constantly on guard. i feel like if i let someone in they’ll take advantage of me, use me, and will leave. i also just don’t like anyone. i don’t want to exist. 

i feel like a monster for not being able to feel."
487,I think I’m transgender,"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I’m 15 and born a male. Being a guy just doesn’t feel right. But also I get along with guys and really only guys and enjoy normally masculine things. I know enjoying masculine things and hanging out with only guys doesn’t invalidate anything but that makes me feel like I’m not. Being a guy just never felt real. I’ve disconnected my body and my mind. I’m disgusted by what I am, not who I am, but what I am. I’ve always felt like if I wasn’t me I’d be happier. It never clicked that it might be my gender that’s triggering that. If I had the choice I’d go back and be born a girl. I enjoy feminine clothing and makeup. I see girls clothes and their rooms and how happy they are, and I wish that it could be me. All but two of my friends hate trans people. Like genuinely think trans people should be killed, so I don’t think I’d be safe if I was trans. Trans life expectancy is less than half of the cisgender life expectancy. From an early age I thought if I had three wishes one of them would be to have been born a girl. But due to my surroundings and the fact that I know I’ll “never be a real girl” I’m going to live my life as a male unless something changes or I just can’t take it anymore. I’m not saying I’m trans, I still haven’t came out to myself yet, I really don’t want to be trans. I’m not transphobic but everyone I’m surrounded by is.  I really hope this feeling either goes away or I am able to come to terms with who I really am."
488,I'm sure I have more than just depression and I'm too scared to sleep.,"TLDR; I'm a 23 year old in Washington with depression and have insomnia, possibly more wrong with me, what kind of professional might be able to help me?

I'm sure you guys hear this a lot but I don't have much money and so I don't want to go from clinic to clinic trying to find the right place for me to be, so I'm posting here to try and get advice or even if there's another subreddit that might help.

Some background: I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 10/11 years old. My memory isn't nearly what it should be but I can remember never being satisfied with my meds and that they didn't help much. I was still depressed, I've cut, and I just felt like the meds I was on made me emotionless. I decided last year to stop taking my meds, just to see how it would feel to be the real me. Overall, most days, I love being able to understand my thought process and my most amazing partner understands I have bad days and he helps me immensely.

Without my medication, I feel like my head is ""clear"" now and I'm either realizing that other parts of my life are starting to suffer, or it's always happened but I haven't been able to process it. I think I have more than just depression.. I get into screaming matches in my head until I start crying. I make up arguements in my head that would never happen and I get severe anxiety about those imaginary fights. I get night terrors so bad I wake up in a panic and I'm scared to go to sleep for multiple nights after an episode. Most days I'm running on maybe a few hours of sleep or so. I get unreasonably emotional about the smallest things and sometimes I feel like I'm going to ruin my relationship. I've become scared of my own thoughts but I'm also scared of even trying to help or try to treat these things because what if it doesn't get better? Sometimes I lay in bed and tell myself ""I can sleep if I kill myself"" and I'm almost at my breaking point. I went to therapy for a few months, it was too expensive and I just don't think it was a good fit..

I actually just don't even know what to ask for anymore.. I just need some fucking sleep and to just know what's wrong with me. Maybe just an answer will make me feel better.. sorry to just rant but I just don't know what to do. Thank you for any and all advice. I'm more than happy to answer any questions that may help lead to the right answer, there's just way too much stuff going on too put in one post."
489,Support Groups &amp; Its Various Types,"[Support groups](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/), as the name suggests, are groups that offer unconditional and unbiased support to individuals who are facing trials and turmoil in their life. The help provided by a support group is usually non-material and non-formal i.e. non-professional. The problem at hand in a support group i.e. the theme of the group is usually shared which means that all the members face problems that are more or less similar in nature. The point of a support group is for members to come together and discuss their problems so as to formulate coping strategies to feel empowered and to feel like they belong somewhere and feel understood by individuals who know what it is like to be in their shoes. An individual’s role in support groups is to evaluate the information shared, relate to others’ personal experiences and share one’s own, offer empathy and establish social networks. 

We have already established that support groups target specific problems, so how do people understand what kind of group will suit the problem they face? The solution is that there are many different types of support groups that offer [group therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) for a specific problem. The point of having a specific support group is to ensure that group therapy is solution focused and caters to each member specifically. Here are three very common support groups that address severe, common problems. 

**Drug Addiction Support Groups** 

Support groups for drug addiction are voluntary associations between people who share a common want to overcome and quit substance abuse and want a way out of drug addiction. It’s important to remember that different groups use different [group therapy activities](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) that range in nature and motive. Some group therapy activities may focus on just reducing the use of substances instead of completely stopping the usage, however this does not serve as a sustainable treatment plan in the long run. Drug addiction support groups help show individuals what life has to offer without the usage of drugs and how that is a healthy, happy way of living that isn’t detrimental to their life, or the lives of those attached to them. It helps them depend on healthier means of surviving and quit eventually but surely. 

**Domestic Violence Support Groups** 

Domestic violence in a nutshell is any kind of violence or abuse, emotional or physical in a domestic setting, typically marriages or homes. It is also commonly known as intimate partner violence which means the violence is committed by a spouse or an intimate partner. This type of violence takes place with children, parents and the elderly as well. Some of the most common types of domestic violence are marital rape, stoning, choking, or in severe cases honor killings, acid throwing, bride burning, dowry deaths etc. This can severely mentally damage victims which is why support groups aim to understand and solve these problems in a personal setting so that these problems can be solved and avoid the mental strain from turning into serious mental health disorders. 

**Suicide Prevention Support Groups** 

As the name suggests, these groups specifically target individuals who are likely to commit suicide or those who are suicide survivors. It aims at raising awareness and creating an effective call to action to address suicide and suicide related problems. They also create helpline numbers that cater to individuals who are at a risk for suicide or people who know individuals who are at a risk of suicide. These helpline numbers are at everybody’s disposal 24x7 so as to prevent suicide."
490,I just feel tired.,"I'm 17 years old, in college in Quebec (works differently here) and I just feel down all the time. I live in residence that my dad pays for, he works his ass off every week to pay for everything and even more so that we can live with momey to spend (we have a boat etc.) I also play football which is my main focus. I have a personal trainer and everything. Even though, I always feel like I'm not doing good enough. All my dad requires from me is that I have good grades. I can't even do that for all he does because I'm always too lazy. I am 110% aware that I am lazy but I can't seem to get past it. He asked me to look for a job if I want to spend money for myself but I haven't even looked for one yet. I also need to take my driver's test but I can't even look to book an appointment because I ""forget"". All I do is play Xbox and I know I should at least do something productive but in the moment, I always seem not to care. And also I'm always a bit rude with my parents and am not grateful enough for what they do. I know I should tell them, but I still always forget. I can't sleep and I'm always tired, and living in residence doesn't help me cuz the other guys that live here do the same stuff but don't really seem to care. Like they always come in and I can't be in peace alone because my roommate lets them in, since we're all on the football team. I'm just tired of being given everything and not being grateful or at least able to help a little. And the fact that I can't do those things just puts me down even more. Anybody know what I should do?"
491,I just learned what psychopathy actually is and everything in my life is falling into place..,"I am actually shocked by how much of my numerous baffling past experiences and quirks overlap with anti-social personality disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

I always had major issues showing my emotions to people as a kid since I quickly learned that emotions are just vulnerabilities for other people to exploit. Although emotionally closing myself off from the world protected me as a kid, as an adult I cannot show the people closest to me that I may have love for them nor do I really understand how to process those kinds of emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always had an issue with authority and although I never managed to push my luck far enough to end up in jail, I am no stranger when it comes to dealing with the law. I now realize that if I keep up with this behaviour I am either headed for an early grave or, end up in prison.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already been receiving treatment for various other mental health disorders (anxiety, depression, substance abuse etc) for a few years now but just the thought of telling anyone I know that I may have anti-social personality disorder frightens me and I don't know if that's because I'm in shock or because I have toxic motives...."
492,I need help,"I have this guy that I'm addicted to talking to, and we're taking a break from each other, and it's hard to me.

I also am experiencing severe imposter syndrome because I have this job interview coming up, and I genuinely feel too inadequate to go. I want to just self sabotage and screw it all up. 

I feel sad and horrible about myself and I feel like I'm a failure."
493,This is my cry for help,"My dad died almost 8 years ago of a drug overdose. My mom is emotionally abusive. I'm gay and when I came out, most of my family disowned me. It culminated in PTSD.

I have a degree in psychology and am starting a diploma in IT. I have over $50,000 in student loan debt, so I'm paying for this program out of pocket and with no support. I got through the first term okay and treated it as a deadline to sort things out.

When the term started I had a kitchen job. They changed their hours so that I couldn't get home before 1am on nights before my 8:30 classes. Sleep hygiene is really important for people with PTSD so I had to leave the position.

I'm a really strong student so I took up tutoring. At times I've had up to 15 tutees. The cancellation rate is so high that I might get 6 hours of work a week. The school can't enforce anything, so I just had to stick it out while looking for other opportunities. I did. I applied for 9 scholarships and got declined by all of them. I've applied to other jobs but they didn't want someone on a student schedule. So I spoke with financial services and started on a payment plan. I made the first payment 3 weeks early and my next one is due tomorrow. I can't afford it.

Self-care is really important to me. I exercise about 3 days a week because it keeps my anxiety down. I cook my food at home to reduce food expenses. I stay at my school until 9pm most days studying extra materials to give myself an edge for job applications. I also schedule time off for socialising and relaxation. I am so passionate about what I do and put my heart and soul into it. I don't have a car, I share a two bedroom apartment with two other people so my rent is low. I'm not just throwing my money away at things.

I am ashamed. When I wake up in the morning, I just feel disappointed that sleep - my emotional reset - isn't enough anymore. I wish I was dead.

I can't explain what this is like. I want to cry and get comfort from my dad and then remember that if he was alive he would have disowned me for my sexuality. I want to ask my mom for help but also understand that the mind games that go along with it would ruin the work I've put into my mental health over the years. There's nothing I can do. I hate that I want comfort from the people who broke me down.

I've never self-harmed and don't plan to commit suicide. Currently I would describe my risk as low. I'm living my days right now and doing what I can to survive.

But I feel so alone, lost, helpless, afraid, and empty. All at once. My passion for what I do is dying and I don't know what I am without it. I have so many dreams and want to change the world. Now I just don't see a point in getting out of bed. I don't know what to do without hope that things will get better.

I wish things were better. I think I did my best but it's just not enough."
494,How Often Do You Have Memories of the Past?,"This is a weird question, but I've been questioning what's normal recently and would really appreciate for someone to give me a reference.

I've had dissociation ever since I was a young child.  I knew I was weird, but it wasn't until recently that I actually found out that it was a thing and not just me.  Changing circumstances have also let me start to work on it now and I've occasionally been feeling present for the first time in basically forever.

The thing is, when I feel present I'll have random memories of my past come up.  Like I'll be walking around and something will remind me of that time my parents and I went on a trip or something.  Nothing traumatic.  When I'm feeling present they happen really frequently.  Like a few times per hour.  And to be clear, I'm not talking about flash-backs or anything.  Just kind of mundane memories.

The reason I'm kind of weirded out by this is that I've never had a memory of my past before now.  Not like this at least.  I could remember specifics if I turn my attention to that, but I'd rarely just get reminded of stuff.  Maybe once a week or less and it was always just a hazy ""oh, I guess this looks like that thing from back then"" or something.  Now the memories are quite vivid.  Like I'll actually picture a scene from past which never happened before.

**Can someone please tell me what's normal for memories?**  I don't know if not remembering my past was a dissociation thing, or if this is just a new weird I'm moving into."
495,Apathetic/Empathetic thoughts at war constantly.,"I don’t even know if this is the right place but I’m really in need of some sort of help.

I’ve got this, thing, where I will think something super narcissistic/apathetic, and then instantly go back on it with the opposite. 

The best I can explain it is with a very recent and extreme example. My Grandma (who I LOVED) just died of cancer. Me and my mother watched her choke on her own blood and die. I cried *that* night. Since then? Not a thing. No longing, sadness, nothing. Just chillin’.

This is the bad part; when I hear my mother crying, or my sisters, or anyone, I tell myself they need to get over it and move on. It’s over and there is nothing more to be sad about. But *then*, I feel like a monster for thinking that. “How could you even think that’s ok?” I ask myself immediately after. 

Her funeral is Wednesday. I don’t want to go. I don’t want to have to see everyone crying over her passing, and find it rather annoying I have to. Once again, I think “Let’s just move on. We’re wasting time mourning.” But, after I think that, the empathy comes back in. 

Does that make sense? Like, I’m aware those “bad” thoughts are not ok, yet I support them. And it makes me feel awful. I feel like a terrible person. 

I’ll probably regret posting on main, but I don’t care. I gotta know whats going on, and if it’s normal or not."
496,I want to cheer up my self deprecating online friend.,"I have an online friend who I became friends with only recently. I will refer to him as Spot. Spot has shared that they have depression and anxiety and randomly share their negative thoughts and experiences. They are also very very self deprecating. Usually when Spot insults themself I compliment them and try to reassure them.

Recently another friend, who I will call Leaf, said that complimenting Spot only reminded them that (in Spot’s mind) Spot is the worst and doesn’t deserve those compliments. Leaf said Spot wants attention but this attention was only making Spot’s depression worse.

I trust Leaf, they are very smart and informed about psychology. I want to cheer up Spot but I am not sure how to comfort them. I would appreciate any advice or insight.

Thank you for your help!"
497,How does mental healthcare get covered?,I live in Canada and I recently ended up in the hospital for a few suicide attempts and I chose to opt out of staying in the psych ward. Apparently since my dad's work benefits include mental healthcare I don't apply for any government programs. The problem is that the benefits are only a few hundred dollars a year and I'm one of several people in my family with mental health problems so the coverage doesn't even come close to enough. Is there any way for me to get into the government programs? If I get myself back in the hospital and stay in the psych ward will my parents have to pay for it? Just trying to find the best option for them financially cause idk how this works at all. I don't want them to have to choose between me getting therapy or them being able to fix the roof or something.
498,Deep rooted self esteem issues (30M),Learned that I may have some deep rooted self esteem issues that I’ve been projecting on my past girlfriends. Was taking corticosteroids which exacerbated those issues times 100. I guess I’m learning to cope with this ugly side of myself. Afraid I shouldn’t get into another relationship until I funny understand why I’m this why. I ruined a pretty good relationship so now I’m alone and in the healing process.
499,Shaking Hands,"Hey guys so here's the deal. I've had unsteady hands for about a year now, and since then it's been manageable. But, now it's affecting my art. Anyone on here know what might be causing it?/Have experience? I got a lot more to work through with my shrink but I'd appreciate the help."
500,Student burnout?,"I'm aware uni can be a very lonely period of time in your life, but now I don't know what to do.  
I've managed to make some friends and I'm on good terms with my roommate, but at the end of the day when I come back to my apartment, I'm always alone (she usually leaves for the weekend and all of my friends come and go by train and don't live here).  
I know I shouldn't complain because I don't have to work to have a place to stay and people would kill to be in my position, but the time away from my family seems to really be eating me up. I'd never been far away from them and now in my second year, it seems to be hitting me way harder than in the first.  
I don't look forward to spending time with my friends, and I never manage to laugh sincerely around them. They're good people so I feel guilty about this and try to be the best friend I can be, but at the same time, I feel like I'm not able to make any meaningful connections. I don't really know how to be myself around others, I thought the problem may be that I don't know my true personality.  
When I feel alone I try to drown myself in the schoolwork, but some nights it's just too much (a couple of times I've bought alcohol to help me sleep) and I'm prone to skipping because I just can't face the day. I feel like the only thing keeping me going is guilt because I want my parents to be proud and don't want to waste time and money. As a result, I haven't failed yet. However, this is all really taking a toll on me; I got out of being bullied in high school and took the next big step just for this?   
I value education a lot, I want to make it clear, but I'm afraid that this loneliness will be my life forever and I don't know what to do.   


I thought about trying to make more of my true personality emerge, but I really wouldn't know how to start. I heard time alone can help, but this just feels like forced loneliness.  


Overall I apologize for the sad, ranty tone of the post, I hope I'm not just screaming into the void."
501,Everything just feels too strange,"I'm almost certain this has something to do with how unbelievably fucked my physical and mental health has been for most of my life, maybe some other people feel similar. More of an off my chest type post.

I guess it just seems from my perspective that everyone is putting on some sort of show constantly expressing how unbelievably happy or sad they are... how cool or weird they are... whatever it may be... It's not like im excluded from this show we all put on, it just all seems like its gotten way too robotic... and god damn..  it pisses me off to no end that I can't find some escape from it. I try to accept it but I always just get so deflated from it all. The only word I know how to describe it is as something extremely uncanny, both on an individiual and societal level... and it just gets worse the older i get. I feel far too young (30) to be saying to myself that I just don't get this younger generation, or hell any generation for that matter. I feel stuck between caring about and wanting to know and love people, but also wanting nothing to do with them.. So  I find myself in this perpetual state of isolation and frustration of not wanting company nor to be alone either...I suppose the end result of these conflicting feelings is a constant state of frustration.

I've sought help to the best of my ability but it really only gets you so far, i figure at some point your experiences and general baselines keep outside help from getting you too far with this kind of shit. Not to say i don't have hope for change."
502,My mental health is almost gone.,"I've been having weird dreams and hallucinations in the middle of the day and at night I've been hearing my name being called out from somewhere within my house.

503,All Aboard The Struggle Bus,"First off, has the energy in the universe just been super off, or is it just me? Probably both. I feel like Earth got catapulted into a different time space continuum. Like the time-shit continuum. There's a constant bombardment of crap happening, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to stay sane.

I've had depression and anxiety my entire life. I've managed it pretty well, definitely more recently as I approach my 30s. But I have my moments, and I definitely had a pretty bad one on Friday. 

I binge drank alone while doing some work, and got shit faced and blacked out. I also embarrassed myself by drunk texting a dude I'm interested in, except said dude is in my school group project. So this week will be fun, and I sincerely hope I didn't just screw myself over. 

Also, this isn't the first time I've done something like this. Basically, I did identify that I have to swear off alcohol completely. I have gotten better at not drinking a lot or frequently (I typically don't keep alcohol in the house), but lately when I've drank it's pretty bad. I'm done-zo, I have to be. 

This turned into me venting, but this weekend was just weird. The whole vibe with the world and people is funky, and not the good kind of funky.

504,Feel guilty for being so obsessive,"I always feel so guilty and like I’m doing something wrong, because when I “like” someone (not just romantically, also just platonically etc) I tend to get very obsessive and my day often revolves around seeing that person. I am quiet so I usually don’t “embarrass myself” / at least to me, I think I do a good job at hiding this “obsessive” behavior. But At this point it honestly feels slightly wrong/ I feel like I’m almost invading these people’s privacy; constantly checking social media (even teachers), constantly thinking about them, constantly trying to impress them, even dreaming about these people frequently. Then I get so upset if I feel “rejected” or let down by these people (because I am literally obsessed with gaining their validation/affection). Anyone understand why this could be happening/ had situations similar?"

511,So im thinking of talking to my doctor about knocking off my morning dose of 200mg of seroquel,"Ive been taking 400mg of seroquel for the last year along with 150mg or Prozac. Prozac and seroquel 200mg in the morning and 200mg of seroquel at night. 

Today i missed my morning med which isnt normally something intentional but i had somethjng I had to do this morning that i needed to be on the ball for. 

It makes me realise how long it takes me to get motivated in the morning after i have that morning dose. And normally leads to me being a total grump with the kids because im so tired.. 

Today i got everything done i needed to and have been a ball of energy all day and alot happier with my kids. 

I go in for a new script soon so i thought this might be a good time to bring this up with my doctor. I also i have quick release pills for bad days any way so if im having a shitty day ill just head in that direction.

513,Wanting more food than I’m actually going to eat?,"First off, I don’t know where to post this. Anyway, I’m just going to get straight to it. I always had a huge appetite. When I was younger, I’d eat soooo much food. Junk food, fruits, veggies, literally anything. This went on until I got to high school when my appetite suddenly dropped by 500% and went from lots of food constantly to little portions periodically. You may think that’s a good thing, and it is, but my brain still thinks I have a huge appetite even after many years. This ends up to lots of wasted food. I guess the phrase “Your eyes are bigger than your stomach” applies really well here. I get uncomfortable when there’s not a lot of food or drinks readily available, and I always get way more food than I’m actually going to eat. If I go to a friend’s house for the night or if I stay somewhere other than home, my first thought is “Will there be food there?”. I worry so much about having access to food and drinks without really needing to eat or drink much. My bf thinks it’s a funny quirk I have- that I’ll get 10 times more food than I need or want to eat (it just makes me feel comfortable to have the option), but it makes me sad to waste so much. Getting small portions that actually suit the amount I will eat makes me uncomfortable and I have absolutely no clue why. I always have to get big portions of food I want or I’ll get anxious. What does this mean? Any advice will help, thanks! :)

TL;DR Not having a lot of food readily accessible makes me anxious and I buy/order/cook way more food than I would actually eat"

515,Am I depressed?,"Where do I begin? ""When did it start?"" I keep asking myself. Did it start? Am I broken?

I am 27 years old, I'll be 28 in a few months and I feel like I'm treading through life without a goal or purpose. I don't find any happiness in anything, I feel like I'm pushing away everyone I love and I feel like I'm digging my own hole. I keep digging and digging until I can't see the people I love anymore and then I blame them for leaving me. I'm wondering how long I've been digging. This is kinda how I picture my whole situation in my mind.

I wish I knew where to begin my story as I have no clue when I got this ... sad? Bitter? I don't know.

Did I have a good childhood? I can't say. Other people have definitely had it worse. My parents are far from perfect and I realize that, but I can't really blame them for my own unhappiness. They were always supportive, though they put pressure on me to succeed at school in order to have it better than them. Was it too much pressure? I don't know. I sometimes acted out as a kid and I was definitely not the most well-behaved child if I think back to my childhood and my mother has always had a bad temper, so when shouting didn't help, I got a spanking or sometimes she took a wooden spoon and hit my fingers with them. My parents argued a lot in the past and there was lots of screaming and verbal violence between them. Now that I'm writing this, I'm kind of wondering if my parents have mental issues as well..

At the age of 13 I moved to a different country, went to a new school, made new friends, started playing guitar, got into a band and put this idea into my mind that I want to do something with music. I rehearsed a lot with my band, (should've rehearsed more myself), we played some gigs and felt like we were going places, though looking back at it, we sucked. We worked hard for a few years though, some harder than others and I was definitely part of them, but at some point, the conflicts amongst the band members just became too many and we split up.

I had finished school and started my studies at university, when I was still part of the band. I didn't really know what to study, but I'd always loved English and biology, so I figured ""hey, why not become a teacher?"". I quit biology after a semester and replaced it with another language. Meanwhile, I still had this idea in my head of someday being able to live a happy life by making music. My studies were kind of always my Plan B. At some point, 3 years into my studies, the band broke up and I started focusing on my studies. I performed really well and finishing my studies wasn't that much of a problem, even though it was stressful at times. 

I met my (now) ex-girlfriend right around when things with the band were going further and further downhill. We got together, were together for a while, I did a semester abroad to improve my language skills, I returned, we moved together. I was focusing on my studies and on my girlfriend and friends. I did my practical training and passed, I got a job as a teacher at my old school and my girlfriend and I moved to a new beautiful apartment closer to our families.

Never could I have imagined how stressful this job could be, especially in the beginning (where I am right now). My procrastination didn't really help and I was permanently stressed out. My ex had to endure my frustrations with myself. All this time I was still having the idea of ""music is my Plan A"" in my head, even though I hadn't written anything in a few years. I think deep down I was telling myself that I didn't have time for making music because of my studies and my girlfriend, then my job and my girlfriend and I directed my own resentment at her.

At some point, she probably couldn't take it anymore and ended our relationship of 5 years. I saw it coming as she was starting to build new friendships, spending more time with working colleagues, smoking, going out, etc. Note: We had just lived in our new apartment (the one I mentioned above) for half a year, when it happened that we separated. This was a year ago. We had bought lots of furniture and I felt like I'd stay in this relationship forever. 

I've blamed her ever since because she ended it, but we still remained friends. I moved back to my parents' house. I started smoking weed, felt like I'd pick up playing music again, told myself that I was free from my ex and could focus on music, started a project with a friend of mine (who's depressed), wrote two songs, realized that they are shit and that I am shit because I hadn't practiced for so long. I got an expensive laptop, some gear and tried to get into recording my own music, but I haven't created anything in months. I started smoking cannabis a lot, almost every night. I tried out LSD a month and a half ago and did LSD two times since then. 

The first trip was just fun, during the second one I cried because of how stressed I feel due to my job and during the third one yesterday, it all hit me like a freight train. I came home and cried for hours. I realized what a shitty lifestyle I've been leading the past year and even before that, when I was still with my ex-girlfriend. I saw some photos of my own graduation, how happy and proud she looked and how indifferent I was towards my own fucking graduation - my ex-girlfriend was happier for me then I was!! I saw how fucking indifferent I was towards her. I realized that I was the one to blame. My mind wandered and reflected on the last 10 years or so , looking for when I had become who I am now. 

I realized that I had been living in fantasy land regarding my aspirations as a musician. I'm not good at it and even taking up the guitar feels like a burden. I realized that I can't become what I want to become. I realized that I am working a job that doesn't fulfill me. I'm getting some positive feedback from my students (of course not from all of them), but I still feel that I suck at this profession and that it stresses me out. I realized that if I quit my job, I wouldn't know what to do with myself and that my life would probably just get worse. I realized that my toxicity pushed away my supportive ex and that it was not her fault, but mine. I realized that I think that I hate myself and that I've done so the past few years. And I realized that I probably answered my own question. I think I'm depressed."
516,I am tired and confused about my truth.,"I don't know how long it has been since I've started feeling like a complete loser in life. it feels like it's all pointless and my existence doesn't make a damn difference in this world. People who mean so much to me can just carry on without me. In-fact, I feel like I am a burden to society and to my parents. I just can't take any more redundant pointless living. 

I guess the point of this post is to get a better perspective on this. I don't know if I am actually depressed or just being a victim and keeping my ego trapped to compensate for my shortcomings

 I appreciate any insights as to what to do as I don't have access to professional psychological help because right now I just want to punch myself to death."

Spiraling into submission-
I wish today i didn't exist.

Turn my back to the music yet again, because it surely is easier to live life with my eyes closed. 
Numb your thoughts babe because-
Ignorance is bliss and routine is overrated.
Thoughts pile, fester, then get retracted back from where they surfaced. Further to be swallowed, further to swell.
In the end i let them all down, contradicting my actions becoming a burden for each and every shoulder i cry onto.
Creating a false reality to shelter me from pain
I create my own obstacles, then trip along the way
I jump to conclusions all while breaking myself down into bits n pieces
I've disconnected from my former self feel shunned from society. Completely unrelatable

For peace of mind
Normal thought processes
Healthy coping mechanisms 
An escape
From what I've come to know as my life.
Im clawing at the walls, gasping for air, stretching for clarity
They make it look so effortless, with style n grace
While time sneaks away from me, i start the cycle once again.
The right path for what i need, for myself to function 
It's a long fucking road to picking up my pieces, once again
And every fiber of my being hopes i give up

Pushing down my guilts and failures
Glossing over my problems for temporary fixes..

518,Help. I don’t even know what to title this?,"I’m posting on here because I’m extremely lost and don’t know what to do. For many years I have felt disconnected from myself, had and still had identity problems, self harm, depression. I was always a little off, but once I started dating this one girl everything took a turn. From the moment we got together I couldn’t go one day without thinking about the pain I’d face if she ever left me (this was my senior year of high school). I was very toxic, constantly pushing her away, causing scenes like yelling or crying historically with any little argument. Sure enough one day I pushed her away too far and she chose to leave me. I drugged myself up with a full bottle of pills but it was only enough to leave me immobile and unable to talk for a while. I ended up in ubh, and even up to thus day I have so much resentment towards her. I feel abandoned and uncared for, even though I knew I caused our relationship to fail. Flash forward to know and I’m dating another girl, and the fear is the exact same. I check in about once a day to make sure she isn’t thinking of leaving me, I cause fights to see if she fights for me back. She has been the best person I’ve ever met and for some reason I just can’t have something healthy. She almost left me today and I wanted to self harm so bad. We’ve been together for a year and I can barely trust her. I’m always questioning where she’s going or who she’s talking to. One day I will praise her and tell her she’s the best thing that’s happened to me, the next I’m accusing her of cheating. I am going to therapy for this, but I am just so tired of myself. I can’t stop ruining things no matter how hard I try. I can’t stop self sabotaging and my paranoia. I came across an article taking about borderline personality disorder and I could not believe I was reading something that felt so close to home. I could relate to all the symptoms and I found comfort knowing I’m not by the only one who feels that type of way, though I’m not saying I do or don’t have it because I obviously can’t self diagnose. I’m just so tired. My emotions are so heavy it makes it hard to live life normally. Should I talk to my therapist about this? Is this just ridiculous? I don’t know. I need advice. I feel like I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this. I’m so scared. So sad. So tired."

523,Are We Over-treating Mental Health Issues?,"Growing up, did you know many kids at your school with ADHD? I knew of a few fellow students with this diagnosis, but it was only a fraction of what we’re seeing today. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recently estimated that nearly 6.5 million children between the ages of 4 and 17 had been diagnosed with ADHD at some point in their lives. This figure has grown by 41 percent in the past decade. Today, 11 percent of all U.S. children have an ADHD diagnosis.

You can view this in two ways. First, it may be a catch-all diagnosis handed out indiscriminately, causing a child to be labeled and stigmatized unnecessarily and prescribed medications when there are less-invasive measures available.

On the other hand, it may be the best effort of health or mental health specialists to relieve an increasing amount of suffering and incapacity in today’s youth.

So there you have both ends of the spectrum. [Here you can take a closer look](http://healthylifestyle7.xyz) and decide for yourself."

She also said terrible things to me in the process. I want to end it all at this point. I have an exam in 2 days and I cannot even study with all of this on my mind. I cannot confide in my school counselor because he is also her colleague since she is a teacher. I feel helpless, truly helpless. What is worse is that nobody in my house other than myself believes that therapy is important."
525,How I finally understand my depression,"I (42f) have never known a time I wasn't depressed.  Starting at a young age, I would feel riddled with guilt and would lay awake in bed at night and cry about things I had no control over (usually mistakes I had made).  I ruminated about every decision or thing that I felt I had done wrong or failed at.  My parents were both oblivious to depression, having adopted late in life they were from the silent generation and had both grown up during WWII in England.  I would say things like I feel depressed and my mom would look at me and say that there are so many people who have it worse off.  (no, that was not the correct response but it was the one she had grown up with and the one that made sense to her)  In my teen years, the depression became so much worse.  I found myself cutting to release emotions and feeling like a pariah for doing it as I grew up when it wasn't talked about and no one else I knew did it.  I opted for long sleeves no matter what time of year, and swallowed down all of my feelings because I didn't understand what they were or where they were coming from.  Went to college and had some of the blackest days of my life, cutting so frequently, and not understanding why I was such a freak.  Finally, I talked to my doctor.  I was 30.  I had lived for 30 years with undiagnosed major depressive disorder and just thought I was broken.  My doctor put me on an antidepressant and for the first time in my life I was able to function like everyone else.  I stopped cutting.  I finally found words to describe what depression feels like to me.  And honestly, just having words to put to my feelings helped me so immensely.  Depression, for me, is like a weighted blanket.  One that is too heavy to feel comforting.  Before I even open my eyes in the morning, I feel this uncomfortable, sometimes crushing, weight making me have to fight to breathe.  It wraps around me when I stand, and stays with me all through my day.  This weight.  This constant companion.  Before I do anything else in my life, I have this weighted blanket that makes even breathing a struggle.  Some mornings, it's so heavy that I can't find the energy to shower, or even get up.  Other days it becomes a constant nuisance, still pressing, but not as heavy.  It's always with me and the weight of my blanket varies from day to day, sometimes minute to minute.  It is only now, in my 40s that I have finally found out how to cohabitate with it and still be functional."
526,College Student Asking For Help,"First, I’d like to say hello and thanks for looking at my thread. I’m not sure if I’ve posted in this subreddit before. I know I’ve posted on a couple different mental health-related subreddits over the last year or so. I apologize in advance for my long post: I’m a naturally long-winded person.

Some background: I’m a junior at a four-year state university studying journalism. Throughout my entire teenage years (high school and time here) I’ve struggled with depression/anxiety, which runs in my family. I was medicated and receiving regular treatment until I lost my insurance in June 2018. Ever since, things have been rough - especially last year. Last April, I unexpectedly lost my mother. In addition to that traumatic experience, I had to endure the fallout (and threats, demeaning remarks, etc.) from her family. Around the same time my mentor was forced out of our university, making him move; I lost my job and also most of my friends graduated.

It was a really rough time. I was able to manage and after months of counseling (thankfully our school offers some on-campus solutions to students for free) I eventually was able to get over my mom’s death and the fallout from her family.

Last semester was somewhat of a struggle. Ever since summer 2019, I’ve lost almost all interest in journalism. (It was almost like someone flipped a switch; I went from being really interested in journalism and active in our student newspaper - where I worked, to having no interest in journalism and not being active in anything.) The journalism professor who replaced my mentor is a stickler who I don’t get along with on most days. Unlike my mentor and most other professors, he regularly writes condescending and demeaning remarks on my work. Although there were times where he was nice and helpful. I finished out the semester with a 3.8 GPA for the semester; all As except for his class.

This semester has been even worse. My burnout/disinterest has progressed, and I’ve felt really exhausted this semester. Even though I’m only taking 12 credit hours (last semester I took 14 hours, and before that I usually took 16 hours) it feels like I’m taking more. I’m constantly exhausted and worn out, regardless of how much sleep I get (and how good that sleep is.) I’ve been eating well and trying to get exercise when I can.

I have the same professor this semester for a higher level (4000 level) journalism course, and things so far haven’t been going smoothly in that class. He wants us to do an article every two weeks, and wants us to write blog posts every week. In addition, he wants us to do video packages, slideshows and other things on top of that. As it is, it’s a struggle just doing the two assignments for his class. (I work two on-campus jobs, which really restricts the hours I can do interviews for his projects.) 

To make things worse, we haven’t started the semester on the right foot. The very first assignment went well. However, the blog posts did not. He gave the assignment at the end of a class and I must have missed the assignment word limit. I went onto our student portal and couldn’t find the assignment guide listed anywhere. After submitting the assignment, he wrote me an extremely condescending email. I met with him and it didn’t go anywhere. I told him how I felt about the email, and he essentially played the “reverso” card and made himself look like the victim - claiming I wasn’t paying attention, etc. Essentially, the meeting ended in an impasse and didn’t help anything.

I made great strides last semester in improving my GPA and I’m afraid this semester is just going to destroy that progress.

Sometimes I get upset about the burnout and disinterest in journalism. I used to really enjoy doing it, and a lot of people liked my work. A lot of people got to know me because of it. Now, I’ve become another face in the crowd and have no interest in it. It feels like a chore just to do it for class. I sometimes feel like I was replaced. Now the student newspaper is thriving under new leadership and I’m not a part of it (and don’t want to be), whereas when I was a part of it our staff was quaint and struggling to stay afloat.

On top of classes and journalism, even things that I used to enjoy in my personal life have become a chore. Before this class (even before I became a journalism major) I ran a personal blog where I talked about things I wanted to talk about. I used to really enjoy it. Now, I don’t have the energy, time or desire to add things to it. Ironically, I now **have** to do it for my class.

I’m constantly exhausted. I feel both my memory and thinking/cognitive skills have declined over the last couple years, especially recently. There’s sometimes where it’s hard to remember what I had for lunch that day, or remember what I need to do.

If you’re still here, I guess I’m just asking for advice on how to manage my stress levels and how to solve my exhaustion problem. Also possibly how to deal with this professor and my burnout. I’m currently working with an on-campus counselor (though, TBH, not a very good counselor; it’s a grad student) to get some assistance until I can (hopefully) move on to a more professional local clinic that has a sliding pay-scale. (I was going to do that over Winter Break but couldn’t get around to it.)

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I’ve talked about my anxiety a little bit over on r/Anxiety but have got very few responses."
527,Any reviews on Betterhelp? What's your experience? I am looking for affordable therapy.,"Hi all,

I am looking to continue therapy but it can be very expensive.
Anyone used Better help before and what is your experience?
Do you find it convenient? Do you find it helpful? Are the therapists responsive? Do you think you would recommend their services and why?

Thanks in advance."
528,can't feel my emotions anymore,"okay so a quick run down of my situation, is that I'm a year 12 student (17 years old) that just got off summer break. During summer break I was fully immersed into spirituality and felt like I had a firm grasp on the concept of observation of my emotions and successfully started to observe rather than I practiced and practiced the art of observing and, I rarely got mad or angry and when I felt happiness it was full and not fast fleeting, it was warm and fuzzy and I felt it for days.


Now that I've gotten back to school I havnt had time to keep up with my spiritual practices ( reading, creating art, connecting with nature, meditation etc)

 ive been running on 1- 2 hours of sleep, hardly eating and living off coffee pretty much. I do think those are contributing factors to what im about to tell u but I think this is, something much more complex than missing a few hours of shut eye.

so I have felt just an immense sense of bordem and 'meh' throughout the past few weeks, as I eased back into school, yes this year is stressful because its my last but even now I don't feel stressed at all. I don't really feel anything at all actually, just rather acknowledgment that I should be stressed or that that situation could be distressing.( school work doesn't stress me out, even though I acknowledge that it should and on some level I subconsciously am, but I don't interact with that feeling at all, I don't even feel it rise, I have zero emotional quality in my mind) 

In the past when I was practicing my spirituality I would of been fine with this. Not feeling the negatives so much but now honestly it's becoming very tiresome. I actually want to feel some sort of emotion not just mellowed out one's that dont last for long at all. 

I have to actively force myself to cry otherwise, I can just feel the need to in my physical body, but it doesn't connect with my thoughts because I don't have any. That's a stretch to say but I just feel like a vessel right now. There's nothing really going on up there. No thoughts to Interact with or feelings to observe. There's just nothing. Even writing this now In the past I would feel sad and sorry for myself but I don't really have any emotional reaction or label on this right now rather I'm just typing for the sake of it. It's all meh

At school I don't have genuine reactions to things people say, do, or tell me. Rather I just see the comment that is supposed to invoke a emotion and analyse it as 'wow okay I'll react like this for you because that's what ur comment was supposed to invoke from me:

Perhaps I'll have a fleeting moment of anger and but usually it's not overwhelming but rather just confusion. I'll give you an example. 

This morning whilst getting ready for school I got a text from a friend, whom had a funny thing to tell me, it felt like deja vu for me so before I even picked up the phone I knew what she was gonna tell me.
 
(something similar had happened in the past, not long ago and my friend is very projecting with her feelings, and me not so much so I had already guessed what she was going to say. Some context: she had a crush on someone and told me she texted her last night and said some silly shit to her in a spur of the moment) 

 so whilst I read her text I just felt confusion on why something like that had gotten to her so much, her text to me was supposed to invoke surprise and humor but rather I was slightly agitated and confused, mostly confusion. I then proceeded to mock her out loud for the following 10 mins. But once again it was more slight agitation, amusement at the stupiidty of the situation and then more confusion rather than anger, and even those slught emotions were in veryyy very small doses. 

I've never really been a ' let's talk about my feelings person' and feel extremely uncomfortable whilst doing so, hence why I'm here on reddit, and why alot of my friendships to me aren't as genuine feeling to me as the other person might pecieve.  I deal with my emotions myself and I find that works very well for me. But atm I'm really not sure how to try and fix this. 

I'm rambling but what I'm trying to say is that over the break something changed I didn't have to hold up a facade because I was mostly by myself and when I did have to interact with my friends it was mostly  genuine and out of a place of good intention. 

But now something just feels off, a laugh from me has absolutely 0 emotional attachment to it. Something that a friend is going though that is really bad and affecting them, doesn't envoke the slightest of pity from me. Rather just annoyance that I have to listen to them tell me about their sob storys, when they have never cared to ask how i have been feeling. More of me asking logical questions and telling them what they want to hear. 

( I might sound selfish and self centred ik but I'm trying to figure out how to re- balance myself?) 

I feel like because I have learned how to observe, I have no attachment to anything, I feel like I'm just floating around. I'm here but not actually here. I present but preset with nothingness. 

Everything just feels not real and meh, time flies and I feel like I have no grasp on it. I can't feel anything and have to actively try to make myself feel something even if it's for a fleeting moment, and when I do even that doesn't feel genuine like it used to. 

I just want to feel something again, I feel like me observing my emotions back then was great because I had all this happiness in my life even if it wasn't constant but now I lack that, so I just feel mellow there's nothing to really get happy aboutor upset about. 

Friendships feel boring, class is boring, I've started perceiving people almost like they are not people but rather just little conversations or images I have to hold up during the day, to maintain my friendships with them and keep my imagine of a carefree, happy quirky girl that no one really knows much about but they hang with me because I'm funny, and entertaining to them. Even though it's not real. 

Bottem line is I can't feel shit, I just feel like a vessel and idk how to reverse what I've done on the break?

 It was great then but now everything feels so bland and I don't feel like me anymore, and maybe that's the ego talking. But something feels off and Im just going though the motions, with zero care in the world for what happens.

 Heck i don't get stressed out anymore about things I used to, nothing has emotional attachment to it at all. And I just feel like im floating along life.

While making some little researches and reading many articles about it, I've found [this one](https://www.nearestdocs.com/psychological-health-something-that-should-really-matter-to-you/). I won't lie that it really helped me a bit to know what's going on, but is there something missing I need to know?"
531,Feeling depressed and anxious,"Recently there have been some changes in my life. I have autism and everytime that happens, I feel depressed, anxious and sometimes I get a panick attack. I just started a new part-time job. I also stayed at my grandparents for a while, and now uni is starting again, I have to go back to my dad's house. Everything feels surreal and negative. My OCD and hypochondria are worse than ever. Last night, I woke up at around 4AM, went to the bathroom and got back in bed. Back in bed I started thinking about the previous day and suddenly felt like everything was spinning. I assume this is anxiety related. It went away when I tried to distract myself with a book. Next week uni starts again, and I think that will make things better, as it brings structure to my day. I just feel very sad and anxious. Is this normal? Do more people experience this?"

535,Can written notes help the psychiatrist correctly diagnose me through the assessment?,"I’ve been told by the previous psychiatrist that I’m showing traits of OCD and also have generalised anxiety disorder. However, there’s a lot more than this to my current mental state. I don’t want to be diagnosed incorrectly, how can I help the psychiatrist understand my situation better other than written notes?"
536,Am I the only one who is constantly thinking 24/7?,"I feel like the voice inside my head never gets a rest, constantly analyzing things that have happened, currently happening, or will happen in the future. 

I think this is having quite a severe effect on my mental health and my coping mechanism from stress is to hide away in my room. 

If anyone can relate or has any advice it would be greatly appreciated."
537,Writing my thesis makes me suicidal,"Hi everyone, english is not my first language, so please excuse me for my grammar/orthography mistakes. 

I've been working on my thesis for about a year and a half, I feel like the more I investigate the less I know about the subject, it's like this ever expanding theoretical sea and I'm drowning in it.
Most of the times I try to work on it I get intrusive thoughts about self-harm and suicide, which thankfully I haven't acted upon, but it's hard because I get anxious, and start crying, and my coping mechanism is to procrastinate, FOR WEEKS. My ideal deadline (haha) was on March, 1st, and when that date was announced I felt like I could be able to finish in time, but my thesis teacher was been «unreachable» (he answers my texts but doesn't help at all, he doesn't read the documents I sent him, and when we talk about the subject he keeps expanding it to other areas that have nothing to do with my core theme) and me, being a pretty insecure person, feel unable to go on writing without approval. 
The next date for submitting is in July, but I haven't written anything in about a year (I've only read, translated some texts, and made an outline), so I don't trust myself to actually finish on time. I feel like I wasted the last year, because I have nothing to show from it.

Of course a solution could be going to therapy but I can't afford it, so I don't know what to do. Has any of you felt like this? Or faced a situation like this?"
538,My mental health is deteriorating and I just am stuck,"I've been exceptionally tired lately (and I bet it's cos I've been multitasking too many things: my school organization, my academics (taxation is taxing my life) and my social life). But see I can't drop anything. My organization relies on me. It's my last 6 months in university. And I can't live without having social time. 

And my mental health is deteriorating. As I write my thesis, do tax homework, and live my daily life, I've been thinking of killing myself instead. Cos if I drop my responsibilities, I feel like I disappoint people. If I kill myself, at least they aren't angry at me. It doesn't help that I watched the politician's first episode. The trigger warning was there, but it was all so sudden. 

I haven't been diagnosed with anything so I refuse to say I'm depressed, but I feel that way. I just.

I wish I didn't feel this way. I am so tired."
539,How do your pets benefit your mental health?,"I have two dogs (Saxon and Max) , two chameleons(Brick and Ghost) and two crested geckos (Walter and Jesse).

540,Questions about asking tough questions in therapy and when is then proper timing?,"Hello all, not sure if this is the right place for this or not but I am realizing that I need to tell my therapist about what is going on in my head. 

I'm honestly considering suicide, and I remember back in the introductory sessions he asked me and I lied. He said, ""Have you ever dealt with suicidal thoughts or thoughts that you don't want to be alive anymore?"" and I responded ""Well, yeah kinda, I've thought it would easier not to have to do this if I was dead"" but ultimately I hid it so well I'm fairly confident that he has no idea to what extent it has been going on. 

My question is, I have an appointment in about 5 hours and I know I should say something to him about it but I have a vacation coming up this weekend and really don't want to get locked up before then. Should I just ignore it until I come back from vacation? How do I even breach the subject? I've thought maybe I could say something like this ""I've been having thoughts that should worry me but they don't"" but then I'm afraid he will find out that I'm considering suicide and have me locked up. 

I hate this so much! Please help me"
541,Not Okay For No Reason,"The worst thing is when you are a super happy person, and nobody can recognize when you’re not okay because you don’t want to share your weakness or vulnerability to everyone because you’re always known to be peppy, happy, high energy, and okay. 

It’s just really hard and lonely sometimes being that happy person. My cup is empty because I have been pouring into so many other people and things in my life that I can’t pour or focus on others right now, and I can only focus on myself - which I know others will come across as selfish. 

I’m just drained and it makes me want to hide and stay in bed all day and sleep. 

When the depression comes, it’s rough."
542,I broke down in front of my parents,"I recently quit my very stressful job and moved back home for a while.

I was at the end of my tether and subsequently broke down in front of my parents.

I'm still at home, but feel like it has destroyed my confidence and my relationship with my parents.

How do I fix it?"
543,I almost don't feel anything,"(Sorry for mistakes, everything that I have learned in English is by myself without any lesson books just by playing games, watching videos, reading stuff, etc. Mostly because my interest in English raised after school and I had a bad time with learning basics in school) 

I made this fake account for obvious reasons.  
I wouldn't say that my life is bad or I been abused by anyone and I wanna die or whatever, but my current state is killing me inside. I believe that everyone who posts here have a bigger troubles than I have and I lucky enough right now. But still. I have complex mental problems that I really want to solve. I would try to describe most of my storyline and problems in this post for better understanding.   
Most of my early childhood (6-11 years old) I spent with thoughts about leaving my family or making suicide, because of being beaten for bad grades or bad behaviour, but I never had guts to do it.   
My parents got divorced because of my father used to abuse alcohol most of the time and used to realise his aggression in violation to me or my mother.   
Since then I have started to try become a ""perfect boy"", like that no one would never be disappointed in me. I'm always trying to act like I'm fine. It turned into that I always tried and still trying to hide my hobbies if they are against parents and relatives preferences. I keep my social media pages super clean because I am afraid that someone would see something that they don't like.   
I never had friends in real life until 10th grade, but they were more like bunch of freaks (we have from 9 to 11 class grades in middle school, on 10th grade classes are getting mixed for ""professional profiles""). Never had a relationships with anyone, but I had few unsuccessful attempts. Never been drunk and don't want to (because of Dad and being ""perfect"").   
My weight is really little, about 45-50 kilos for 173cm height and I'm almost 22 years old. I almost don't feel hunger until it's starts to hurt. I don't eat any type of meat. I'm not vegan, I just don't like it, but my body is weak because of that. I got used to be hungry.   
I was often disappointed in some things, due to which I had a constant denial of the new things, new food. I always trying to avoid conflicts, hate to watch politics, hateful people which is like to discuss aggressively about unfair things, because usually it's just provokes to bigger aggression.  
Right now I almost finished my university, but failing to complete my diploma project due to apathy, eternal weakness and completely screwed sleeping schedule. Right now my usual time when I'm going to sleep at 7-9am and waking up at 4-6pm. I feel sleepy and sick if I sleep less than 9 or 10 hours.   
I went to university because of my parents pressure. I don't really like it, I chose my specialization because only thing I had interest in is computers that's all. Also, we don't have any kind of career guidance in schools.   
I tried to reduce my time that I used to spend in internet with no reason like playing games, watching videos to be more productive, but most of the time I was just sitting in front of monitor by doing nothing. Then I tried to abstract completely from it to finish my diploma, but didn't realized I made my state much worse. I spent almost every day for month trying to type something into my diploma, but I did almost nothing.   
While spending my time in university I've found passion in art painting, especially environment but not only. I have pretty good knowledge in different types of art for beginner, but I have no skills in practice. It's really hard to study art without teacher. My attempts looks terrible for me and it pushes me away. I want to make very skillful arts that I can be proud of, I don't want to make casual arts  
I live in Russia, my country isn't good at insolvency, especially in art. I don't see any possibilities to earn money from drawing and I'm scared to move to foreign market because of my low level skills.   
Currently I work sometimes for freelance to design scenes for streamers for low cost.  
My mom always complaining about lack of money and forced me to find a job to pay my university, but our town doesn't have any except of low level job like cashiers. Work conditions usually kinda bad. I worked at McDonalds for 7 months in terrible conditions (tons of clients for small restaurant and no other fastfoods around and lack of employees). My muscles started to contract involuntarily periodically due to this experience.   
Also, due to moms lack of money I never felt this money belong to me. Most of my salary went to pay my university and some other things, part that I kept was less then 10% which I mostly spent on a bus.   
Most of the day I just waiting for next day. Im lack motivation. I don't care about my relatives lives, I don't feel almost anything except sadness. I still sometimes getting happy for short amounts of time by watching Pixar cartoons (which I really love), playing some games, mostly old ones and listening old songs. But I can't feel happy only by watching same movies or playing same games again and again.   
I don't blame anyone in this situation, but I'm so tired.  
P.S. I don't think about selfharm or suicide or anything like this"
544,Wearing an Apple Watch improved my mental health,"TL;DR: Having an Apple Watch monitor my physical activity kept me motivated to stay moving this winter, which descreased my seasonal affective disorder symptoms. This is kind of a long post, thanks in advance for anyone taking the time to read it :D

At first, I wasn't sure what to do with it. Seeing notifications pop up on my wrist was neat, but I felt self-conscious wearing a Watch, with an iPhone in my hand and AirPods in my ear. I felt like a walking, talking, constellation of privilege. I also felt guilty looking at my Watch at the wrong time. If I was talking to someone and glanced at my wrist, they could interpret it as a signal that I'd rather be somewhere else. In reality, I could just be checking the time, or quickly seeing what the latest buzz was for, but they would have no way of knowing. There are a lot of minor social cues that can make the Apple Watch a tricky device to use. It caused me anxiety until I got used to it.

Now that I'm used to it, the Apple Watch has some benefits. Closing my rings feels good in a way that my Mac or iPhone can't replicate. Having it on my wrist is comforting, whether it be for telling me the time, who just texted me, or how my activity for the day is looking. It is the least necessary device I own, but it's also the one I would miss the most.

Mental health isn’t as easy to monitor as physical health. The Apple Watch can’t yet detect that your moods have sunk, even if you stop closing your rings. If your mind is a muscle, the Apple Watch can’t measure its exercise in the same way. For me, I’ve found key areas where the Apple Watch can make a difference though — keeping me focused on moving and keeping me connected to those I care about.

In both areas, it’s simply a tool in a larger toolbox, but I’ve found the Apple Watch to be a valuable tool for keeping me honest and monitoring my overall fitness progress, both physical and mental. Closed activity rings are good days. Streaks of closed activity rings are something I've come to take pride in. I'm currently on a 141 day streak, and the thought of breaking it is enough to get me off the couch, [which has a lot of benefits](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495).

For me, the winter months have always been a bit tough. Months of dark and cold weather have a way of dragging down my mood. I think it's normal to feel a bit of depression when the sun goes down by 5 PM. It can be a really powerful feeling, whether it's strong enough to be diagnosed as [Seasonal Affective Disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651) or not. Winter used to be a time for me to stay inside, struggling through until the warmer and brighter weather comes back around. I know a lot of people feel the same way.

Even if you’ve never experienced depression or never needed to talk to a doctor about managing how you feel — I think it’s just as important as getting in better shape. We should talk about mental health as openly as we talk about physical health. The Watch helped me reshape my life. Staying active over the past few months has helped keep the worst of the winter blues away. It coached me through a lifestyle change, motivating me in small ways every day. I have no doubt that without the Watch on my wrist, I would have been less active and been in a worse mood.

I also realize it's an incredible privilege to be able to afford such a luxury, and it's possibly a character defect that I have come to depend on it. The benefits of exercise are not a secret, I could have done all of this on my own without a computer on my wrist telling me to get up and get moving. For me though, it was good to have a reminder, a tracker, and to be able to see my progress reflected in data. Bad habits are hard to break, and new ones are hard to form. The small nudges the Watch have helped me, and have made my life better. That may sound overly dramatic, but it's true.

The best thing about the Apple Watch isn't what it does for me, it's how it makes me feel."
545,Need some advice.,"Umm so I have noticed that I lack empathy, like seriously I don't feel empathetic at all. I also have never felt guilty or remorse. Now I haven't hurt anyone mentally but I have tortured and killed some fishes, turtles, chicken and I have no guilt or remorse, but however I have realized that in doing so it does not benefit anyone so I have stopped doing so. I am a pathological liar and I'm great at manipulating people and often get stuff done from others like I make my friends do my homework. I faked extreme anxiety and made my teacher believe I couldn't do a presentation just so because I didn't wanna come to school and also managed to get marks since I wrote the speech material which was said by my other team mates. 


I'm weirdly and extremely introvert but I have no social problems as such, what I mean is I won't go to parties or social events however if I was dragged into one, I wouldn't have a problem striking up a conversation. I'm no charmer or extremely attractive but I have a way with girls and I'm pretty good at talking to them, I have never had any problems with being nervous or anything when talking to the opposite sex when a lot of people I notice are afraid. 


I never had a girlfriend neither am I interested, I am all about causal sex and only because I don't have much time to waste. My goals are in my career and minting money and that's all I care about apart from my inner circle that includes my family, pets and some friends. I love them and take care of them because I value them a lot for their presence in my life but like I said, I just can't feel empathetic guilt if I have done something bad to them. 


I lack morality but a strict follower of rules, yes at times I have broken rules but nothing major. I did a bit of research and NO I don't think I'm some kind of psychopath, sociopath or narcissist although there are a lot of boxes I check, I don't think I can be diagnosed. I had a slightly tough childhood but nothing traumatising at all. Dad and mom had got divorced when I was like 3 but it did not affect me as I was taken great care of by my grandparents.


So I need some advice because clearly I'm a little off than others."
546,I can't seem to get any further in my recovery. I'm maintaining at a level just above suicidal and I don't know what to do.,"Hi all  


So I had a really rough 2019. Had a few mental breakdowns and ended up at a psychiatrist and got diagnosed with depression, anxiety and severe OCD. Also had my relationship of nearly 6 years end. I had also started a new uni course and nearly failed it, but managed to pull through. Left my job of 5 years, too.   
Because of this, I've had to use everything I have to push myself to keep going. I've been suicidal, i've nearly relapsed cutting after 6 years.   
All that I can manage to do is wake up (usually in the afternoon), waste time (usually social media, gaming etc.), eat 1 - 2 meals which are usually junk or easy food, then go to sleep around 3-4 am.   


I want to fix my sleeping schedule but I hate being conscious for the amount of time that a normal day is. I woke up at 2:30pm today and I'm about to go to sleep around 2am. That's about all I can handle. I eat junk/easy food because making anything is like....not happening. My room is trashed even though I try to clean it once a week. I need to do laundry. I avoid anything I can, which includes stuff I enjoy. Some days, I do exposure therapy (&lt;1 hour) which takes all of my mental energy. I'm trying to find work but haven't found anything yet. I volunteer once a week but i've hurt my foot badly and can't do that for another 4+ weeks. I see my friends a lot but I'm starting to get tired of them, too. I spend a lot of money on buying food and just things to get cheap entertainment so I can feel happy or at least not depressed for a bit.   


I don't know how to get back to actually being alive and living. At the moment I'm just floating in life. Like trying to get past the days. I feel annoyed when I wake up most of the time because now i have to be conscious again. I'm just really, really tired and I've had enough but the days keep coming. I'm grateful to be alive, I'm just really struggling. I feel like I'm drowning and every time i come up for air, another wave hits and drags me under. I need to breathe but I don't know how."
547,How do I approach a psychiatrist?,"This is kind of a dumb question, but I'm 19 and this is the first time I'm going to a psychiatrist. Last year I had a sort of mental breakdown and my therapist gave me the number of a psychiatrist she knows, so that I can reach out, possibly try medication, etc. 
It's been a few months but I think now's a good time to get it over with and text her, but I dont know what to say. I just wanna book an appointment so that I can get an evaluation, and see where I'll go from there. Can anyone help me out?"
548,I just want mind mind to shut up,I just moved when i didnt want to and i want mi mind to just be quite for once and not think about anything i just want to go and and find a quite place in my head.

Thoughts of doing drugs  
Thoughts of drinking alone  
Thoughts of going to the church

I know I want to give love and happiness even though it will be hard for me to feel them

I don't know"
550,"The combination of my disease, personality traits and experiences isolates me. I'm so tired of this","Hey there. 

Long story short. I (22F) am an introvert, likely a misanthrope, shy, quite aggressive when something ticks me off, been through traumatic experiences totally controlled by the people's stupidity plus I have schizotypal disorder. 

Each day I can feel myself straying further from the society. I'm too nervous and helpless to make new friends and too tired to maintain the old ones. Also, I'm really good at making enemies by calling people out on their BS. Literally every human interaction wears me out. 

Why can't I be normal? I mean, sometimes I enjoy interacting with others as long as I'm drunk or rested enough. 

It'll be really tough for me when I'm back in the uni. I'll have 2 roommates I'll need to have at least basic contact with, plus the friends that haven't left me yet. 

I do want to interact with people but I feel like all this above stops me. How do I get myself into social situations without freaking out, bottling up or lashing out?"
551,My dad died last month and I just feel nothing anymore.,"My dad was told at the beginning of November that he had lung cancer and had only 6 months to live, in January he passed away.

Since his funeral I just feel empty all the time, like there's a void inside of me. Nothing matters to me anymore. Everything just feels so unimportant and I can't bare to live through another day.

My dad was my best friend and it all happened so quickly. I just feel so lost. I've suffered from depression for years and a few months before my dad was diagnosed I was put on antidepressants, they seemed to work but since my dad's passing I feel like they don't do anything anymore.

I don't know if I'm posting here for advice or to just get everything off my chest. My family and friends know how badly I've been struggling with the loss of my dad but I don't want to tell them that since his passing I've been having thoughts about ending it all. Part of me knows that I couldn't go through with it but I don't know how to get past this feeling of complete and utter devastation."
552,"student seeking help on this subreddit, bc i feel i got no one else","I'm aware uni can be a very lonely period of time in your life, but now I don't know what to do.I've managed to make some friends and I'm on good terms with my roommate, but at the end of the day when I come back to my apartment, I'm always alone (she usually leaves for the weekend and all of my friends come and go by train and don't live here). I know I shouldn't complain because I don't have to work to have a place to stay and people would kill to be in my position, but the time away from my family seems to really be eating me up. I'd never been far away from them and now in my second year, it seems to be hitting me way harder than in the first. I don't look forward to spending time with my friends, and I never manage to laugh sincerely around them. They're good people so I feel guilty about this and try to be the best friend I can be, but at the same time, I feel like I'm not able to make any meaningful connections. I don't really know how to be myself around others, I thought the problem may be that I don't know my true personality. When I feel alone I try to drown myself in the schoolwork, but some nights it's just too much (a couple of times I've bought alcohol to help me sleep) and I'm prone to skipping because I just can't face the day. I feel like the only thing keeping me going is guilt because I want my parents to be proud and don't want to waste time and money. As a result, I haven't failed yet. However, this is all really taking a toll on me; I got out of being bullied in high school and took the next big step just for this? I value education a lot, I want to make it clear, but I'm afraid that this loneliness will be my life forever and I don't know what to do.

I thought about trying to make more of my true personality emerge, but I really wouldn't know how to start. I heard time alone can help, but this just feels like forced loneliness.

Overall I apologize for the sad, ranty tone of the post, I hope I'm not just screaming into the void."
553,Time to charge him,I'm finally making the statement to have him charged with sexual harassment.  He's destroyed everything
554,I always feel lonely,"I guess I kinda know why I’m like that. My father was emotionally neglectful and I always tried to seek his approval. I tend to obsess over guys who show me the slightest bit of attention or friendliness. All of my friends are married or getting married, but I’m single. I feel alone, even though I have friends. I always wanted to be in a relationship, to have someone take care of me and also take care of them. But I feel like no one wants me. Why do I have to be alone? Haven’t been through enough loneliness? I know it sounds selfish, but I just can’t seem to get better. I’m tired of creating scenarios in my head of things that will never happen. I’m tired of being alone. I’m tired of wondering if I’ll ever find someone. What is wrong with me? Am I just meant to be alone? Am I too sick to love someone else? 

Sorry for the rant haha"

I am going to die... Right now I have to stop for a bit and plan better. I made a will out...a Holographic Will I believe it's called. That was painful.

So I am still here... Not that anyone gives a fuck, except for family and my one friend on here.

And it burns so much. Why did I do this? After 2 years of being clean. I feel so embarrassed. I dont know what to do or say about it"
557,What would you guys suggest to someone dealing with self-hate?,"I feel too scared honestly to end it all, but it's much easier to destroy oneself slowly, that is what I am doing and frankly it keeps me on an even keel mentally. As atleast this way I am able to give an outlet for my self-hate."

560,Alcohol and drug abuse resulting in BRAIN FOG?,"Looking back at my younger years, it is very evident to me that I’ve dealt with mental illness since young age. English wasn’t a strong suit in school so bare with me through this post. This is the first time I’ve put my past into writing. I’ll be as brief as I can. 

Starting with OCD. I remember being under 10 years old. Befor bed I would check each door to make sure it was locked probably 5 times. Than brush my teeth a very specific way. Than before ide turn the lights off in my room. I would scan my room 10 times. Making sure the closet was shut, then making sure the curtains closed, the things on my desk organized the exact way I liked. I still deal with OCD do this day.
I brush my teeth that very same way. I check to make sure the doors on my truck are locked too many times after parking it. I still go around the house making sure the doors are locked to many times. I’m leaving out a lot of things but you get the idea.

The next thing would be social anxiety. Around the 10th grade is when it really started to get bad. I believe smoking weed was the main culprit for introducing anxiety to my life. I started smoking weed in late grade 8 occasionally. By the end of grade 9 I was getting high all day. It changed me from being a popular, social kid too an extremely introverted person who only cared about getting high. I slowly pushed all my friends out of my life. The worst part about it is I knew the weed was giving me anxiety but I still kept smoking for another few years or so before I quit. The more secluded I got, the more depressed I got. School became to much for me and I was switched to a co op program where ide work from home and meet with a teacher once a week handing in my work. 

I eventually sought out a psychiatrist for the drugs I thought were the answer. Benzodiazepines. I told him all the so called side effects I was experiencing with drugs like Paxil and cymbalta. Eventually getting my way and getting the benzo’s. starting with clonezapam, then Valium, and lastly Xanax. With the help of these drugs I went back to a program in college where I finished my credits and got my diploma. 

At this point my depression was maybe at an all time low. I just felt as though I was a useless part of society. No friends. No ambitions. I just wanted an escape from reality. At this point I had quit weed. So I then found alcohol. I was drinking everyday, by myself. And drinking to the point of passing out. On top of that I was mixing the benzos with the alcohol. This I believe resulted in brain damage. After 2 episodes in the hospital and an almost overdose. They took me off the benzos thank god. I think they just made my anxiety worse after getting off them.

I continued to drink heavily for another year and a half. I did a one year course in college during this time. 

Then I decided to get sober for almost a year. I got so tired of getting past out drunk every night. The following year was one of the best in many. I went back to school got a truck license. Got in with a union who put me through a heavy equipment operating coarse. During that coarse I met some friends. And I did drink with them only on weekends. But I was happy. 

The union then got me a job as an apprentice. During that year I rekindled my relationship with some old friends. Only drinking with them on weekends. The thought of hanging out sober with them brings on a lot of anxiety so I’ve never done it. To this day my relationship with the few friends I have is only drinking with them on weekends. I’ve gotten past out drunk a handful of times and embarrassed myself. My one friends parents actually said they didn’t want me around anymore because of this. :( I don’t drink during the week. Only once a weekend or once every other. But it’s usually like 15 beers or so..

Eventually completing my apprenticeship and making over 6 figures I am doing well in that aspect for my life. But the past 6 or 8 months of my life I just have been feeling down. I think I also have some kind of a bipolar disorder too. I probably should have mentioned that somewhere above. Some days I feel great! But the majority for days I feel depressed. A lot of which stems from my lack of communication skills with co workers ⭐️.

Another thing that’s come up in the last six months that is ABSOLUTELY DEBILITATING is brain fog. This is the main reason for me writing this post. I feel as though I have this pressure inside my head. Sort of behind my temples. Just like a cloud almost inside my head ALL THE TIME. I can’t even think. I can’t recall memories well. I can’t have meaningful conversations. I have no mental clarity. And it’s negatively impacting my communication skills at work and with my family greatly. Which Is making me more anxious and more depressed. I feel as though I’m getting dumber and dumber everyday. I eat healthy, take supplements, workout, do cardio. I really don’t know what to do. I believe it could be a brain damage as a result of my drug and alcohol abuse. But I don’t know. I had a good 2 or 3 years after quitting the daily drinking. This brain fog is killing me. I did go to the doctor once about it and he took blood work and I got my eyes checked but nothing came up.

I don’t know what to do :("
561,it feels like,"it feels that the only purpose for mankind, is to make babies, support an endless war, and make spend money. that's it. no deep philosophical purpose. just bullshit production and hatred.

I don't belong on this planet. I don't make babies. I don't support wars. and I hate money to the point for 2 years of my life I lived on 1.50$ a meal and lived under a tree,."
562,I’m so ready to give up,"I’m just tired or everything. All of it. I’m tired of people looking to the good to distract them from the bad because it’s uncomfortable. Well there are people who live in the bad every single day, and you ignoring it doesn’t stop that. And I hate when people try to get me to focus on the good with them. I don’t want to heal because it feels like I would be abandoning that little boy who needed someone then, as well as all of the children being abused daily. I don’t care about starting a life and “thriving to spite” my abusers. I don’t care about that at all. I just want to run away from it all and be alone. I feel like I’m going insane. Like I am living in a different world than them. The only people
Who can relate to me are those that have been abused. But even some of them have tried to tell me to focus on the good. Am I crazy? I don’t even know at this point."
563,I keep letting my mom drive drunk,"I'm a 26m who lives with his mother. She has a drinking problem. I let her drive when I knew she was too drunk to drive. That was about a year ago. She wasnt stumbling, but she was slurring her words. I felt terrible, and vowed to never let her drive like that again. Well, last week, she called me on the phone asking when I would be home, because I was working late. Her words sounded slightly slurred, but sometimes she slurs her words even when shes sober. She sounded fine fir the most part. But I still asked her if she had been drinking. She said no, she just got off work. I said I believed her, and than I hung up. Several minutes later, I was sitting in a parking lot waiting for my boss to call me, and my mom pulled up next to me. She started talking, and sounded fine for the most part, but I wasnt sure. She kept trying to talk to me, and I kept giving her one word replies. I just wanted her to shut up, and leave, because I didnt want to discover that she was in fact drunk, beaver then I would have made a scene, but I didn't want to make a scene if she wasnt drunk. Well, I'm thinking she was drunk, and now she thinks ""oh, he cant tell when I'm drunk, so I can drink, and drive all the time now"" last night she came in my room. She said she was going to take food to a friend. On of her words sounded a little funny, but I often worry too much, and think shes been drinking when she hasnt, so I just let her go. She returned about 30 minutes later. I went down stairs about 30 minutes after she got home, and she was drunk, so I think it was likely she was at least buzzed when she was driving. I was so angry at her, and at myself for letting her drive, I took a plate, and smashed it. That was last night, and I feel like I'm not much better than her, because I ket her drive when I was suspicious shes been drinking. I know how messed up drunk driving is, and I should know better, and put more effort into preventing my mom from driving, when I suspect she had been drinking. It's just, I've expressed countless times about how I feel about her drinking, some especially driving, but she just keeps doing it. I know I need to really step up now. Do you think I'm a bad person? Can I redeem myself?"
564,"What does it take to acquire a skill? Does anyone else really struggle? Anyone in a professional field or really good at something (art, physical, cooking, anything) able to give some insight?","I really wonder if anyone else has this awful, awful problem. I know this was long but for once I actually put a lot of effort into writing something like this. If you read it I’d really like to know if you have or had similar issues and what you did or if you know why that may be.

I want to talk about what **I think** it takes to properly acquire a skill or learn a profession, whether as a hobby or for an income, and what my issues are that prevent me from applying any of it.


What I’ve observed from people who actually make “careers“, regardless of how successful they are (e.g. you don’t have to be the head of a multimillion company; but you do your thing and actually make progress in life) and I do feel like the ability to learn a skill is a really big factor there.

One thing is learning properly - and putting in hard work.


Basically, no matter what you want to do, whether it’s learning a language, an art form (martial, musical, drawing and painting, etc etc), a profession or any other skill, you need to learn the basics, the theories, and do the practical work to the point where it becomes a second nature. Emphasis on the last part. I think about everyone knows that this is how it’s done but I certainly didn’t UNDERSTAND what this meant for a loooong time. 

A really good example is languages - you COULD bullshit through it and only learn the stuff you find enjoyable, but when you have to hold a conversation you will make many mistakes, run into misunderstandings, resort to google translate a lot, and if you want to come across as fluent you will strain yourself a lot (e.g having to quickly memorize new words and adjust certain phrases instead of making sure you understand the grammar behind it) which wouldn’t be he case if you did the hard work at first and got the basics down, so that you just need to flick a switch and speak in the other language you learned. That, in turn, will give you the self confidence of being competent, even if you mess up every now and then you won’t have that looming feeling of “i’m just a fraud” at the back of your head and be able to learn from errors.


In my case, I think it stems from never having to learn in school and basically being able to bullshit your way through a lot of things, thereby getting positively reinforced, that you only need to do minimal effort to get great results, and it’s biting my ass really badly now.

Another big thing is routines.

I’ve definitely noticed that the people who have a skill and are actually good at it did this hard work very routinely, and enjoy being able to kind of “automatically” use that skill without straining themselves and if they run into issues, they can rely on the fact it’s not due to their lacking understanding of fundamentals.

Aaaand here’s my problem:

For me, I can see this behavior in other people and understand what it technically takes to acquire a skill properly and all.

 I don’t know if it’s just from my experience in school, but I somehow find the idea of being able to “be good at something” unappealing in a really weird way. Stay with me here. I’m going to use the example of drawing because that’s a thing I like to do at which I am not very SKILLED at. See, when I draw something and it unexpectedly turns out great, I really get a kick out of it. The idea that -after a lot of really excruciatingly hard work- I could just draw about whatever I wanted to, and the quality would not vary a crazy amount, is just so boring and unappealing to me, and yet it seems a really nice thing to achieve, I don’t know. I think the lack of getting a dopamine kick from doing something is what bothers me. I hate routines and I cannot understand for the life of me how anyone could enjoy doing the same thing repeatedly and actually get enjoyment or a sense of accomplishment out of it. I feel like I’m the opposite of an autistic person in that regard. I feel like I’m losing my mind if I get into a routine and feel the urge to break out of it no matter what. Long term rewards really don’t work well in my favor - almost always I feel like I have to invest a ton more into something than what I eventually get out of it, and with short term rewards at least I can occasionally get more out of it than I put in. I really don’t know how to break this cycle. I wish I’d be able to maintain more long term ambition for something, but as much as I’d like to be a better artist, it’s not enough for me to sacrifice a lot of the very little energy I have, especially since I know for a fact I wouldn’t  even feel accomplished if I did. 


I think I enjoy being a consumer too much - I’d like to get the same awe feeling from looking at my own work as I get from looking at others. I notice a lot of people who are really good at a skill aren’t even truly aware and it’s just a casual routine for them, maybe one that just pays the bills. The idea that I could be doing fantastic things and not be able to enjoy them as a consumer is horrible to me."
565,"I'm obsessing over my ex-best friend(19F), and I'm creeping myself(18M) out...","I'm on a mission trying to figure out wtf is wrong with me.

There's this girl who I was best friends with. I also had feelings for her. Sadly we stopped being friends around a week ago because of how bad my anxiety got. It started negatively impacting her life (long story)

I reached out to her yesterday, she said that we're on good terms but she does not want to become friends again. I realized that I would do anything to try to get back in contact with her.

Here are some examples**(it seems I'm a very creative, manipulative and creepy person)**:

* I'm telling my side of the story to people who I know will tell her friends, who in turn will tell her. By doing this I'm hoping that she will forgive me and reach out.
* I'm even ready to lie about what happened, like If I need her to feel bad for me to take me back I will make her feel bad.(like wtf is wrong with me?)
* I go through tinder looking for her profile, I know that if we both swipe right, that means she forgave me. 
* We had a song that we both loved, I was thinking of posting it on my Instagram story. I thought it would make her remember the good times we had with that song. And then reach out.
* I literally changed my phone location with an app, hoping she would notice I was in her town( snap map) and reach out to me.

This shit scares the fuck out of me. It's not even like I consciously do this, it's more of an impulse. There are 2 options here:

1. This is my way of stopping the anxiety attacks over losing someone I cared for greatly.
2. I'm a fucking creep or something, like this shit is manipulative.

**Does anyone know wtf is wrong with me?**

Like everything that I do seems to revolve around her and only her, wtf is happening? Like I can't do anything for myself since we're not friends anymore."

I wouldn’t class it as a headache, but I’m not sure what it is, I suffer from anxiety and it tends to get triggered when I’m stressed upset and or scared. I hope I don’t sound stupid but I was wondering if anyone knew or had an idea as to what’s going on?"
569,Im done with is world,"My spark is fadeing I can feel my light leaveing my body, my family is nice but sometimes treats me like shit. I don’t wanna live like this anymore, I could just run away from this life and start a new. No one cares abb me anyways, no one whould know I was gone any ways, no one whould miss me. I just don’t wanna handle this life anymore. I’m done"
570,I relapsed.. TW,"Last night I spaced out and relapsed.. I had the craft blade I use to cut foam and paper, and I just sorta zoned out while I was watching random YouTube videos... I came out of it before I could do any real damage but I have four small cuts on my wrist... And now I have to hide that shit.."
571,My struggle with my mental health and obesity. (Long story),"I think this is as good a place as any to get my thoughts out there regarding my mental health. 
In four words: it's not going well
Before I write one word more I would just like to get it across that there are a hell of alot of people on this subreddit and elsewhere that have it far worse than me. I just thought I'd share my story.

I've always been a bit of a loner, always preferring to work alone and never really feeling like I belong in any friend groups. 
However, I never had too much of a problem with making 'friends' 
I would always change my personality based on who I was talking to and be as good a friend as I could possibly be. This was pretty much my life until I was 17. Had lots of friends and always made an effort to see as many people as possible but felt alone and started to dislike myself for seemingly not having a personality of my own. 
This dislike for myself started to grow and grow. I started my first job as an accounts assistant at 17 and the true isolation began.
Unfortunately my first job was in a small commercial warehouse with only my manager in the office with me. Within a month my manager quit the business and I took on her previous duties. 
Overall within the context of this post, it's not very important why but It turned out she wasn't doing quite as much work as she portrayed herself to be. I was therefore able to do both roles myself. Since I always preferred to work alone, I convinced myself that this was a good thing. 
This lead to more money but it also lead to gradually decreasing social skills. I saw the business director twice per week for half an hour and that was my lot for human interaction in the workplace. I would open up in a morning, lock up and night and email the director if there were any major problems. 
During this period of time my previously mentioned friend groups were still a large part of my life. I still went out with friends after work and stayed in touch with everyone.
This started to change though as my self loathing took on a more insidious roll in my life. I started convincing myself that my friends only liked my persona and wouldn't like me of they really knew me. This lead to missing a few nights out with friends to begin with followed by cutting people out of my life. After all I was better off alone and I was a terrible person anyway. I stopped enjoying going to the gym, playing sports, hiking and seeing people. Within six months people stopped inviting me out. I deleted my social media accounts and decided that I was better off alone.

This went on for 5 years. 
During this time I felt low most of the time. I hated myself and desperately wanted to be anyone else.
My only small moments of comfort came with food. A viscous cycle started. I would eat large amounts of sweet food until I felt Ill then sleep. Wake up the next morning and hate that I had eaten so much. Rinse and repeat. Over the 5 years I put on alot of weight. Though at this time I avoided mirrors and other people like the plague so I didn't know just how much until later.
After around three and a half years of being overweight, all my problems were explained by it.
No friends? 
It's because I'm so damn fat
Hate yourself?
It's because I'm so damn fat.

My life became a revolving door of self loathing that was reinforced everyday by telling myself that I was worthless and didn't deserve to be even the slightest bit happy. I had plenty of thoughts of suicide, I considered it every day for months at one point. The only thing that stopped me from going through with at one point was that it would tell my family that I was depressed. Secrecy was always my primary thought. No one could no that I was unhappy. I always put on a big smile for my family and told that I was happy. Thinking back now I doubt they believed me.
Then one day I woke up and decided to slim down. I wish I knew why i made the decision that day. I still have no idea what it was that pushed me over the edge but I decided to buy a set of scales and weigh myself. I guessed that I'd probably be around 200lbs I knew I was overweight but I had no idea how overweight until I stepped on the scales and saw 238lbs
That was just the jolt that I needed. I immediately threw away all junk food in the house and bought healthy food. I limited myself to 750 calories per day and to started excercising regularly. To begin with it was utter hell. I had gotten used to around 3500 calories per day with no excercise. All of a sudden I threw myself in the deep end and I was hungry. Morning, afternoon and night I was hungry. I couldn't sleep because all I could think about was my stomach at night. This went on for a month. During that time I kept weighing myself and I lost alot of weight.
After a month I looked into techniques for losing weight and learned that I wasn't doing it in a very healthy way. Turns out 750 calories isn't really enough when you're also excercising. I decided to up it to 1500 and up the excercise. It worked a treat. All of a sudden I was feeling full. I was sleeping much better and I was still losing alot of weight. 
When I got down to 180 lbs and I wasn't obsessing about my weight so much I started to realise that I was still miserable. Contrary to what I thought would happen I still hated myself and I still didn't enjoy leaving the house for essentials (over my time in isolation it had been getting more and more difficult to get my hair cut or go to the dentist) 
I had managed to convince myself that all my problems were down to my weight. Now that I was no longer overweight, I should be happy right? 
As this realisation sunk in I started to lose all hope. Maybe I would always be alone. Maybe I would never have any friends again. 
Luckily i still had my new found energy from sticking to an active routine and decided that I may need help. I had always been adamant that my problems weren't real problems. There are people out there who have it worse than me. Therefore I'm pathetic for even thinking about asking for help. 
I thought 'screw it, let's give it a try'
I contacted a local councillor and worked up the courage to go. After my new councillor had heard some of the broad strokes of my story she was able to convince me to come back next week.
After a month of seeing her she convinced me to start taking antidepressants. I was against the idea but thought that it couldn't make my life any worse than it already was. 

I've now been on antidepressants for 3 months and have continued to see my councillor every week. In general my life is starting to improve. I still don't have any friends but at least I can leave the house with alot less anxiety and I can stop myself from spiralling with negative thoughts. My ultimate goal is to meet new people and get a few friends. Who knows maybe I'll even be able to start online dating.

Overall, I'm glad that I was able to lose the weight and get help. Looking back I really needed it. My outlook is alot more positive now than it used to be and im actually looking forward to the future. My councillor has asked me to write down my thoughts, goals and a bit about my past. I thought that I might as well post in on Reddit. You never know, there may be another person on here in a similar situation to the one I was in a year ago. Severely depressed but not wanting to get help. My only advice to anyone in that position is to just bite the bullet and and seek out mental health support. Loneliness and self hatred are a terrible combination. If you're in that position then please reach out and talk to someone. I bottled up my thoughts for years and it didn't do me any good."
572,How can I cope when my boyfriend has been deeply depressed for over half a year and it’s seriously affecting my mental health too?,"It’s almost like living with a stranger sometimes now, and that’s so heartbreaking and painful. My own mental health is deteriorating with him. 

He used to say the most beautiful things to me. Tell me how much he loved me and wanted to do everything for me. How much he wanted to please me. How he’s never felt this way about anyone. How he wanted nothing more than to make me the happiest person I could be. 

He was never perfect, and his anxiety got the best of him sometimes. Before me, he was alone and simply “existing”. He would cry when he felt overwhelmed or if he thought he had said something to hurt me. He’d always pick himself up though. That first 15 or so months together he was genuinely happier. I thought I was the light in his life. 

Now he is so consumed by anxiety, bitterness, anger, self-loathing, lack of interest, and it’s almost like his emotions have died. He doesn’t cry anymore. He just gets angry. It’s been that way for over half a year. 

We barely have sex, and he used to want me every night. We barely go out. He hardly leaves our room. He doesn’t really talk to anyone other than me and his mom and sister. He struggles to enjoy watching movies and listening to music, which were two of his greatest passions. 

Sometimes I feel angry that I let myself fall so in love with him. I feel so helpless and worthless and unloved. I feel like he doesn’t care about our relationship or me anymore. I used to be his priority 24/7 and now he seems to want to be alone most of the time. I’ve tried to encourage him to make some changes and get help, but he’s not really making an effort.

He says that he still loves me deeply, but he just can’t express it properly. He says that he wants to do things for me, but he’s just so anxious. He says he wants to have sex, but the drive just isn’t there. He says he wants to get out more... But how can I believe that if he isn’t making any real efforts? 

My therapist told me that I need to hold myself accountable by essentially giving him an ultimatum. I helped him set up an appointment to see a psychiatrist this Wednesday. (He backed out of the last one because he was too anxious.) If he refuses to go, then I will need to leave him. 

I can’t picture my life without him, but at the same time I know things will only get worse. I don’t want to be miserable. I don’t want to end up resenting him. I’m so tired of constantly thinking and worrying of him and putting my needs second. 

He has his semi-good days, and those are the days that I can recognize the man I fell in love with. When we do have sex, I feel so close to him. But those days occur less and less. 

What can I do? What is your advice? Anyone who dealt with this (and didn’t leave your partner), how did you get through it? Is this salvageable?"
573,I'm lost,"I have serious problems with becoming dependent on people but I'm not sure if I have a dependency disorder. I'm 16 years old and can't trust adults or form bonds with them at all. It's really scary for me and has made me feel alone my entire life. I never could go to my parents for comfort and support and still can't. I have a really bad problem with becoming dependent on relationships with guys. If I'm not in a relationship I feel extremely scared, alone, and life seems to have no point. I've been this way ever since my first relationship 2 years ago. My most recent relationship just ended and I'm lost. I don't want to become dependent on another relationship. I can't handle any more heartbreak and I want to be healthy. 

I find it very difficult to bond with women and because of this I haven't had a close friendship with a girl in years. I simply just don't know how to. 

I'm alone and scared and I don't know what to do next."
574,Friend's friend is in midst of what he calls bipolar/OCD episode but I'd love some input,"Note: I'd posted this to r/ocd but it was removed, which I understand in terms of it seeming like I'm fishing for a third-party diagnosis. I'm not exactly, but I get it. I'm hoping it might fit better here. 

My question is about a friend’s boyfriend. He’s apparently having intrusive thoughts, but those thoughts specifically revolve around her past relationships. She’s in her 40s and he has started obsessing over what he terms her “hedonistic” and “promiscuous” phase in her 20s. She was actually a pretty normal college kid so I’m confused about the problem but whatever. So he had some sort of episode in which he could not stop fixating on this. He went to his therapist and he’s asked my friend to take down pictures in her house, but the pics aren’t of ex-boyfriends. They’re of her and her friends during her 20s. It reminds him of “that time period.” One of the pics is with me at an event overseas. My friend was single. No hooking up took place at all on that trip but he says her facial expression in the pic is a trigger for him.

He, by the way, has nearly the exact number of past partners and apparently has ruined relationships before this over this same issue. One of the relationships was with a woman who’d only been with one other man, and that was her ex-husband, so hedonism does not apply.

I’m trying to wrap my head around what to say to my friend. For me, this seems like controlling behavior that has maybe more to do with being an asshole than having mental health issues, but maybe this scenario is more common than I realize?

There have been other issues that seem, to me, to point more toward control issues than mental health issues. Mind you, I have MI issues. My husband does. This friend does. I volunteer at a suicide prevention place. MI issues are not completely foreign to me, and they're absolutely not something stigmatized in my mind. But here are some of what I consider red flags: He told her he was laid off from his last job and he's had trouble finding work. In reality, he was fired for behavioral problems in 2015 and hasn't worked since. He told her he's living off smart investments he'd made at his previous job, which likely \*was\* actually a good-paying gig. In reality, he does live off some investments, but his parents pay his rent. (He's 37.) He doesn't want her improving the house she owns because he thinks that means she'll never leave it to live with him. He wanted to move in together after they'd dated for three months, but she wisely said that was too soon. He took offense and called her an asshole.

She doesn't have an issue with her past. That he fixates on previous lovers is his problem, not hers. She's never been married, and she hadn't dated anyone at all for at least a year prior to him. She's had four longterm relationships in the past 12 years, and that's her sexual history during that time frame. He keeps sending her articles like one on Slate called something like, ""What does your number of sex partners say about you?"" He also sent her a poem he'd written about wanting to die and she's the reason why. He's currently \*entertaining\* the idea of in-patient treatment, he says, though he hasn't taken any steps in that direction. 

TIA."
575,Question about seroquel,"Long story short I have been dealing with anxiety and depression basically my whole life.  About 2 years ago I accepted I needed help and got connected to the local mental health facility.  I have now been through their mandated short term therapy and am as they put it just ""working with the doctor(psychiatrist)"" meaning a purely chemical approach.  About 2 months ago I was put on seroquel and my dose has been increasing since.  I am at 250mg a day (plus other medications venlafaxine and methylphenidate) and just feel constantly depressed.  Before my moods would shift up and down but now I am just a constant 3 (1-10 scale 10 being super happy 1 being super depressed) with occasional shifts down to 2.5 or 2.  I have nightmares every night I have 0 ambition and am constantly struggling with intrusive thoughts and an intense self loathing.  Should I expect this to pass or do I need to contact the dr and get something changed?"
576,Hated myself since I [F17] was 10 years old,"I have had very low self esteem ever since I hit puberty. I literally see no way out, no way to ever be happy, or to love myself. Everything I hear about having high self-esteem involves challenging negative thoughts and telling yourself that they aren't true, but I don't think I can. When I look inside myself, all I see is negativity and darkness. I see a monster, a gremlin, a gross, depressed lump. I see a lazy, unmotivated failure of a kid. I look in the mirror and all I see is fat, though my BMI says otherwise. I pick at acne-ridden skin, wipe my dark circles, pinch and pull at my baby cheeks and cracked lips. I keep avoiding the topic at therapy because I know my therapist will make me try to love myself, when there is nothing to love. Is there another way?"
577,What’s wrong with me man this sucks so much,"I’m not suicidal yet but I’m scared I may become suicidal if this doesn’t fucking stop. The last couple of months have been HELL. Look how many posts I’ve made about it I cannot shake it off! All I think about all day is fucking how the hell i exist how the hell is any of this real how does the universe exist how did it suddenly come here how did it suddenly exist how does anything exist what if it ends any second my mind feels like it’s going to explode I have an extreme fear of infinity. I have an extreme crippling fear of the universe and constant anxiety dread and ocd about it. I just want to focus on normal stuff like what plans can I make with my boyfriend this year where can we go what fun stuff can we do, but all I can think about is the universe could end any second and there’s nothing I can do! I feel so out of control. I have panic attacks how anything exists. I feel sick I feel scared I feel depressed I’m so fucking terrified. I feel like I’m going to be trapped in an eternal torture I’m fucking freaking out I can’t cope please help I can’t do this shit for the rest of my life I want to feel normal again please"
578,My anxiety is destroying my life.,"Sorry for any mistakes in text. 

Im pretty sure I’ve had anxiety my whole life. One of my earliest memories was me only four/five years old freaking out because my dad left me in the car to pay for gas, and I’m sitting there hyperventilating thinking I’m going to get kidnapped. In my teenage years I went though this stage where I thought the world was going to end. I was freaking out for legit six months. Barley getting sleep, barley eating, staying in the house, if I hear one noise outside I freak out. All of my relationships have been horrible, most of the guys I end up with are insane and criminals. I have PTSD from dealing with one of them for three years. It was nothing but emotional abuse and cheating. 
I’m now with a great guy and my overthinking is eventually going to push him away. If he’s with friends and doesn’t text back within an hour, my mind starts to wonder. It’s goes from maybe his phone died, maybe he’s ignoring me? But why? then it goes downhill and I’m assuming he’s cheating. In the mornings when he gets up to go to work my stomach turns to knots and I eventually start puking, because I’m freaking out thinking he’s lying about going to work, I feel miserable all day. Even though deep down I know he’s not cheating and I know he’s at work, it’s like my brain works against me. My ex use to lie about going to work and when he wouldn’t answer the phone, he was using drugs or cheating. So I’m assuming this is from PTSD. I really need help but all of the doctors around my area are booked up for months and I don’t know how much longer I can take dealing with this. 

Once again sorry for mistakes or bad punctuation in the text, I wrote this in a hurry."
579,How do you get over the little betrayals and the fact that very few people truly understand you?,"You know the ones: when pals flake on plans that you made to go get coffee during your lunch break just one too many times. When it makes you feel that you don't really matter to most of your friends.

Or when those very few who are closest to you just don't understand your feelings, or what's going through your head, despite you trying to make it clear to them over months, or even years. ""Get over it"" can only be heard so many times before you begin to feel hopeless and alone.

This is a genuine question. I spent my day at work, putting on ""the mask"" - not too outgoing, not hopelessly shy. Balanced. Not too happy. Not too sad. It hit me like a tidal wave of sadness, lethargy, and depression as soon as I got home. And I feel like a waste of space for feeling the way I do, because as I am told by those closest to me, I have nothing to be sad or depressed about. 

Everybody has problems. Some have much worse problems than me. Why can't I get over it? Why can't I get over the little jabs that my friends, whether intentionally or not, throw at me? Why can't I accept that my closest relatives will never understand me above a surface level, and react with bewildered impatience whenever I am down?"
580,How do I get therapy without my parents finding out,"I recently moved out of my toxic family\`s house. I often struggle with eating and often think about life and how pointless it is. My life growing up sucked and I know I need therapy and i have tried calling my dad to ask him to let me use his insurance to get it. My parents are stereotypical boomers and don\`t believe in therapy, my dad responded to my plea by stating ""My money pays for real sickness."" and claims that my problems are because I don\`t try enough and ho i should be giving all of my time to strangers and how I should be praying to God for help. I\`m tired of praying to God, he obviously hasn't helped and I need to take this into my own hands. What do I do? Please help."
581,Screaming voice in my head from anxiety,"Hi everyone, little backstory, I’ve talked a little bit about this on another post but I was sexually abused at around 7 years old. Being 18 now, I don’t know why but I can’t stop thinking about it, it’s like everything that has gone wrong for me is *because* of that experience. I have trouble in social situations, when I did have a gf I wasn’t able to kiss her, like an actual mental block I just wasn’t able to push myself to do it. I have fantasies that are gay or that I am a woman yet I was born a male. Recently I am unsure why but my anxiety has gotten to a really really bad point and now every other thought I have is this voice in my head screaming at me, and I can’t emphasize it enough SCREAMING at me, reminding me about everything that has happened to me. I just want them to go away I can’t think straight or function correctly. I’m not sure what my first step in help is but if I don’t get help soon I will end up killing myself."
582,Struggling at work,"I'm really struggling at work and I cannot work out why. To begin with I thought this was just a case of 'I can't be bothered today' which we all get like sometimes, right?
But for the past few weeks, I'm dreading going in, sat at my desk wanting to cry, counting down the hours until I go home, but for the life of me I don't know why. I get along with my colleagues fine (although at the moment every single one of them is making me so irritable, I don't want to be around them) and my actual work is fine. I feel exhausted. 

I get home and I am totally fine, until I start dreading the next day. I am getting headaches every day because in my head, I am so stressed and worked up over nothing. Half the time I can't even concentrate on my work. What is wrong with me. 😭

I don't feel like I can even speak to anyone because I can't tell them the problem, basically I just don't want to be at work! Help."
583,i get super stressed when things aren’t where they’re supposed to be,"i really love order and having things organised, clean and neat. im 16 and a female and maybe 5 years ago i wasn’t like this. my room has to constantly be clean, i can’t sleep if something is out of place, even if clothes are on the floor. i can’t work in my room if it’s a mess. if my space is a mess i must clean it or i can’t think about anything else. it’s progressively getting worst and im not sure what to do since it’s not bad enough to affect my life a lot. it’s not even just cleaning, everything has to be perfect, my school books and notes, the pillows on my bed, everything has to be organised and be in its place and if it doesn’t have a place, i’ll reorganise to make one for it. my boyfriend is a messy person, well not awfully but he’s no where as near as organised as me and when he comes over and leaves a wrapper on the side it drives me crazy. he’s very supportive tho and calms me and tries to be as clean as possible. even when something smells bad, it’s drive me crazy, like the smell of baked food or smoke or anything in my space makes me want to cry, it either has to smell nice or no smell at all, everything has to be perfect. ive broke down in tears over things being messy and i don’t think that’s normal. can someone maybe tell me if this is a problem or im just being stupid, i don’t wanna speak to a doctor since it’s not that serious and people have bigger problems which can be dealt with instead. although it would be appreciated if someone could tell me what im dealing with thank you :)"
584,What the Hell do I do? Pretty long post inside. Based in the UK.,"One of my very good friends is currently undergoing an extremely traumatic period. She had some horrific experiences in her childhood which she was told she'd imagined only to have her memories confirmed a couple of years ago. She suffers from complex PTSD and experiences vivid flashbacks and mild hallucinations. 

She's sought treatment in the past for her issues through the NHS; has been in touch with Crisis who were shit, amongst other things. It's left her extremely reluctant to try again and has got herself caught in the trap that the people that abused her must be brought to justice for her mental health to improve. Unfortunately the family member that abused her died twenty years ago and so the police have no case to pursue. Since she found this out she's really gone off the deep end. She's determined to get some kind of closure for her trauma but seems to have zeroed in on that people must be punished. 

She has tried to take her own life on multiple occasions. Every single day I do what I can to get her out of the house because when she cocoons herself into her living room her mood takes a severe downturn - she knows this and knows how beneficial she finds getting out and about can be for her mood, but it's still an uphill struggle every time I try to get her out in the first place. Her coping mechanisms consist of alcohol and other slightly more questionable methods along those lines. They're working for her in that she's still here surviving but they're not working for her in that she is showing any signs of any improvement. I am by no means any kind of mental health expert and so I don't really know whether what I'm doing is actually helping her. 

As I write this I have not heard from her since Thursday. We called the police on Friday evening as she had sent some distressing messages on that Thursday and the Friday we didn't hear from her at all. They found her in her house, safe and sound but with a smashed phone. Since then I have knocked on her door every day but if she's even there she won't answer. She hasn't sought other methods of getting into contact with myself or her other friends. I'm going out of my mind with worry about her and I just don't know what to do. 

If anyone could give me any kind of pointers for me to try or for me to help her in any way I would be so appreciative."
585,I constantly feel like I'm messing up and my immediate reaction is to cry...,"I've had anxiety as long as I can remember. Been in and out of counseling since I was a child and have tried multiple medications with no luck. 

I have an intense fear of failure and making mistakes. My body's reaction to the slightest mishap is to cry. I've gotten pretty good at not crying at work or public, but at home with my husband it's like I cant control it sometimes. 

For example. I accidently overloaded the washer and now it wont stop flooding the floor. We cant afford a plumber or a new appliance and my poor husband is trying to fix it. He got rightfully upset and immediatly my eyes started watering up. He got mad that I started crying again. Now it's been a few hours and I'm still on mental repeat of ""Its all your fault. You did this. You've robbed your husband of a day off to fix your mess. You've cost yourself possibly thousands and fucked up your finances.... now he hates you you selfish bitch"". Didnt help that my husbands temper isnt good under pressure and he made me look stupid for not having infinite towels.

This happens for whatever reason at least once a day. I know the long term answer is that I need help for my issues again but were not in a good place financially to get help. What tips or tricks are there when this kinda thing happens?"
586,I accepted my life long envy,"I just accepted that i may have been envyous of my best friend (Since over 10 years) all along who over time gained many qualities i always lacked (Education, romantic relationships etc) and that i might indeed have an inferiority complex due to having a older sister (I am a man btw) who was always the vastly more successfull sibling since our childhood days.

All i ever had was physical fitness due to me working out on a regular basis most of my life and i used that as a means of compensation. I am capable of genuine admiration towards people who are more advanced in this particular area and use that to further motivate myself. Not so much in other areas.....

I pretended to simply not ""want"" the qualities the individuals i described above have when it actually was the other way around.

I even pretended to be ""proud"" of my sister and my friend and would compliment them on their achievements when in reality i felt empowered whenever they suffered a setback.

I dont even know why i even wrote that. I was in tears moments ago after realising all that.

What am i even doing here"
587,Cycling panic attacks and nothing but antipsychotics to hand HELP,I've been getting panic attacks lasting 20 to 40 minutes or so one after the other and I don't have any benzodiazepines to hand and I'm feel like I'm gonna die if i can't get this shit under control all I have is a small amount of Lyrica that I need to save for work and seroquel will it stop this if I take a like twice my daily 100mg dose?

588,I think I have ADHD and never knew.,"So i’m 18 and I’ve always been a fucking lazy unorganized mess. Ive never finished my home work on time, most of the time I don’t do it at all, not even in elementary school. I rarely finish things until the deadline and when I do, I never to them precisely and always miss things. 

I’m very impulsive and say things I don’t mean ( It gets really bad when there’s alcohol involved).

I lose everything (I’m on my 7th key and maybe 4th wallet) and get easily distracted by my own thoughts or my phone. But besides fidgeting, I don’t have signs of hyperactivity. I can sit still at school (i still fidget, but i don’t feel the urge to stand up) or at other events, and I only sometimes feel the need to just go out and do anything, although I think this is just out of boredom.

589,Feeling watched.,"Hi! 
This is something rather odd, but lately I've been feeling like this when I am in my room. First off I'm a college student and I'm living alone. My room is rather small so idk if this may be in fact some sort of claustrophobia I have. But it makes me nervous whenever I am in my room.

I'm a kinda shy, nervous gloomy person lol and this has been keeping me awake till late multiple days in a row. It's like I'm afraid to fall asleep,and when I wake up it makes me afraid to leave the security of the blanket ahah. Even things like the touch of my own hair or clothes on my body, when I'm in my room, make me flinch. When I feel this ""presence"" I'm always also scared of even mentioning it trough text message which is so weird lol

Has anyone ever felt like this? Do you think I might be having some sort of problem?"
590,I think I’ve ADHD and it might be too late for me now.,"So i’m 18 and I’ve always been a fucking lazy unorganized mess. Ive never finished my home work on time, most of the time I don’t do it at all, not even in elementary school. I rarely finish things until the deadline and when I do, I never to them precisely and always miss things. 

I’m very impulsive and say things I don’t mean ( It gets really bad when there’s alcohol involved).

I lose everything (I’m on my 7th key and maybe 4th wallet) and get easily distracted by my own thoughts or my phone. But besides fidgeting, I don’t have signs of hyperactivity. I can sit still at school (i still fidget, but i don’t feel the urge to stand up) or at other events, and I only sometimes feel the need to just go out and do anything, although I think this is just out of boredom. 

Like i’ve said, I kind of have always been like this, but i’d say that between the ages of 15-18 it has gotten worse, since i’ve gotten more responsibilities, but I’m not able to take them.

591,Why do I talk less and remain silent all the time?,"And people ask why are you angry or sad and im not, Honestly i just want to be like the others full of joy in my class.
When someone sits beside me we never laugh and when we talk we talk a little bit.
But when they sit beside some other person they laugh and chat.
It Hurts."
592,"People who have stressful and demanding jobs that don’t allow you to slow down due to the nature of them, when you’re having a depressive/low episode and lose all motivation how do you manage to keep up with your work?",
593,I'm living life as 2 different people and idk who I am.,"Gender confuses the shit out of me. I like he/him pronouns. I'm hella insecure in my body but not cuz of it's gender.

I've fantasized before about having the body of a chick. I remember secretly trying on my like 17 year old cousins bra when I was like 6. Wishing I looked more like my female friends at like 4.

I feel like Id be totally chill and confident in a girls body but idk if I actually care which body I've got.

I've gone through periods of my life where I thought I was definitely trans and times where I definitely am not.

I have a desire to fulfil the classic dad role but I also have a hyper sexual brain which conflicts with that. I'm bisexual, and sexually a switch. I hate my hyper sexual fantasies, one of which was for a long time cross dressing and forced physical  feminization.

I've had a lot of sexual trauma. I was a porn addict from 7-11 and from 13-1 week ago.

I'm a 15 year old (male..?)

What the fuck is wrong with me.

I've got a gf I care abt a shit ton. I don't wanna say love cuz I'm 15 but I feel like that's what it is.

I hate this. I hate myself.

I hate feeling like no body will ever be right, like no pronouns, personality, nothing will ever be right. I have the desire to be violent and destructive and loving and caring and sexual and sensual and a man and a woman and I FUCKING HATE IT. I can't afford therapy. I can't tell anyone in my personal life.

Do you know how much my friends and girlfriend would hate me if they found out their massive 6 foot broad shouldered 200 pound bruiser has had a literally life long struggle with sexuality and gender? What the fuck."
594,Is it normal that every time you relax you feel under pressure because some cunt is Going to try to pressure you into doing something,"I have chosen my path in life it's not to be expendable and work myself to death for what's is traditionally what we do.

Personally my focus is narrow . It's narrowed in on working and saving for a long term goal and from there I will refocus .
In the meantime my plan is to keep stress to a minimum to sail through and hit the goal.

But you be got shyte I don't even want to be a part of coming at me from every damn direction . Family telling me who what I'm expected to be shaming all this bullshit . If your male people just want more more more . 

I'm here for a good time not a long time way am I talking about we die much younger.  I don't have a family don't want a family definitely not now if ever . So the standard expectations so just really do not appeal to me. I like my space I like my freedom.
And i take life one step at a time and think about life rather than being controlled by everything and everyone around me .

So my point is.  Is it normal to the minute you sit down and relax your feeling that pressure that someone will be bitching and moaning about something 

People are daft , I get a lot more done when people are out of my hair."
595,"I’m not sure what to do next, any suggestions?","Today I had a bit of a mental health meltdown. I’ve been told I have major depressive disorder. I’ve been on medication for almost a year. Today I went into work feeling numb like I was watching while someone else was doing all the work. My limbs felt weird. The last month I’ve been on a downward spiral. I was feeling a Little Rock bottom at that moment and though that I needed to talk to my doctor immediately so this doesn’t get out of hand. But then I was questioning myself whether or not I actually have issues or not. Like my brain was telling me that I need to just buck up and ignore my feelings because they’re fake and move on. I didn’t feel like I could trust my own thoughts. I went through the convo with my boss in my head explaining that I needed to go and talk to my doctor and I almost started crying thinking about it. So i took that as a sign that I needed to go. At this point I’ve been wound up thinking that I cannot trust myself at all that I’ve fabricated all of this for attention and pity. At this point I’m full out panic mode shaking, breathing heavy and stuttering. I spoke with my boss and surprise I almost cried. Everyone watched me leave almost crying. I called my doctor a a member of my doctors team answered me and said he would leave notes for my doctor and he would call later. It has now been almost 4 hours. Should I call again? Should I just pretend all of this didn’t happen? I am starting to feel like again I can’t trust my brain and I fabricated this too to get out of work. I don’t know what to believe. I feel guilty for leaving work and not seeing my doctor even though that’s why I left work in the first place. What do I do?? How am I going to go back to work after everyone saw me walk out with tears eyes?? Everything’s all messed up!"

I have sat in my room for 7 years alone only going to school or work and now I can’t even do that. I have nothing I want to get plastic surgery but there’s so many things I want to fix and I’ll never make enough to get it. And it’s so far away I don’t want to live like this any longer. I’m young I’m supposed to be beautiful and living my best life but it’s taken away my wild free years I hate my parents for making me I wish my Kim had an abortion. I truly fucking hate them. 
It’s not fair that their are beautiful girls with perfect hair and bodies walking around living better lives than me and I’m so nice and hardworking and no matter how hard I try I’m still ugly. Fucking bullshit."
597,Please help me. Is this normal?,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

So I have diagnosed myself with OCD.

To start off, I have been creating numerous accounts for years. I've always tried to ""change"" my life and ""renew"" myself. And if I make one wrong move, I have to leave those accounts and create another one. I always end up ""messing up"" where I have to start over again. I've probably created more than 1,000 accounts. If I don't ""renew"" myself, I go into a state of distress. I get to the point where I'm so stressed, I stay awake all night and half the day thinking about it. And when I do finally sleep, I'm literally thinking about it as I am sleeping. I'll wake up every 10-15 minutes thinking about it and it pisses me off so much, so I wake up in a bad mood.  It has gotten worse over the years, and it is affecting my life. I've tried so hard to keep one account. I keep telling myself that I'm okay, I can do this, but I always end up giving in, and creating more accounts. I have to ""change"" on a certain day as well. And I have to restart all of my devices and clean them off when I do. And when I ""change"", I basically try to be perfect and do everything perfectly. If I don't word something correctly, I have to do it over again. If I make a typo, I have to do it over again. If I don't do my usual routine that I made up for myself, I have to do it over again. 

It's annoying and it's exhausting. This is also giving me suicidal thoughts. I've been trying my absolute hardest to overcome this, but I just can't. I always go right back to where I started. I'm losing hope.


(I'm sorry if this is hard to understand. I have been trying to find a way to explain it for so long because my friends, as well as my siblings, ask me why I do it. They also make fun of me for it, as if I can help it.)"
598,I need help. Idk what is this pain.,"(17 yrs old) Recently, from the last 2/3 months, i have a continous low mood and sadness, and idk why. My life is good, i have a  lovely family, i didn't have any kind of traumatic childhood experience, my marks at school are actually pretty good; the only thing that i can complain about is the fact that i am single, and i'm not so popular, but i dont care about those at all.

&amp;#x200B;

 I even have an active social life, but i feel more and more lonely as the time passes. When i hang out with my friends, i am often bored. I think that nobody cant understand my pain because it's really hard to explain ( it's a mix between sadness, emptiness and nostalgia, and i'm pretty sure it's not depression or something like that).

&amp;#x200B;

 After that i feel like my life is ""empty"", like if i don't have any rule in this world. I already have a hobby, and it's music, and it's the main thing that can make my mood happier. I use it to hide my demons, and this happiness cant last so much. And now music is my drug; i usually listen to it around 2 and half hours a day.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end i randomly think about past years, and i cant stop doing this.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably all these things come from my ""mental behaviour"": i am a really reflective boy. This thing is becoming worse day per day, i cant stand it, and the loneliness is slowly strangling me. I'd greatful if you write your thoughts down there. Thanks."
599,I can't do this anymore,I have enough pills to kill me. I can't be here anymore. The pain is too much
600,Why doesn’t anyone want to be around me?,"I’ve invited most of my friends over to hang out on multiple occasions lately and nobody wants to be around me. Am I that worthless? Am I a shitty friend? How can I get people to want to be around me? What did I do to turn them all away? I just want people to be around so I don’t feel so lonely, that’s all."
601,My friend is too dangerous? -long read-,"Hi, please know posting this here because I’m at a total loss of direction. I don’t know how to handle a situation like this.
I am 23 years old and have had a friend “J” (real name kept anonymous) since I was 15. I went off to college after highschool and so our friendship drifted off a bit during that time. I would occasionally meet up with him during my summer breaks and he would bring up stories about his Acid trips. I don’t have any experience using hallucinogenics, so I listened to the stories and didn’t think about the harm the drug would later inflict onto his life. Around senior year of college my other friend had said that J had been acting “a little weird” lately. He explained that J was having body/facial ticks, and says things that don’t make sense.
Fast forward a little over a year..I moved back to my hometown (J’s hometown too). I catch up with J...I still have a hard time explaining how he acts/behaves now...but J is no longer J. Physically speaking, he went from a muscular Hollister model looking guy, to a disheveled, acne festered, mess. That didn’t bother me so much, what DID bother me was his behavior. There simply is no J. Its like his soul had left his body and I was talking to a shell...an empty human being. His eyes looked right through me as I tried to speak to him. His jaw had PAINFUL looking spasms. He would uncontrollably laugh/giggle. To top it all off, he could even speak to me! He was creating absolutely absurd sentences, that I could make no sense of. There were only a few things I understood from what he was saying. He had told me that he sees XXXTENTACION (a dead rap artist). He said that XXX stares at him and doesnt say anything. Same with tupac. I made up an excuse that I had to leave and I immediately texted my friend I mentioned earlier “Dude. J is f**ked up! What happened to him?” He responded “J turned insane. Hes crazy man. Legit crazy. He started doing acid like every day. Now hes just permanently f**ked”
A couple weeks go by and my friend and I pull up to J’s house and tell him to get into my car. I turn my car off in his driveway and try to have an “intervention with him. We tried telling him he needs to lay off the drugs, hes been acting “off” recently, and that we will help him find a job. Hes not comprehending any of it. It was sad and frustrating. My friend then says “J we were going to talk to your parents first, but we wanted to talk to you before doing that”...J snaps back with his first real sentence that weve heard in months by saying “Dont do that. Ill kill you”. I quickly de-escalate the situation by saying that we wont tell his parents and this will be kept secret between us. J leaves the car. We go home.

Fast forward a few months, hes been sending me very creepy snapchat videos of him looking into the camera and twitching and saying nonsensical things. He looks worse than ever. 
 He also managed to tell me that he got diagnosed with psychosis and is taking medicine for it. Idk how psychosis medicine works, but he does not seem any better. He also told me that he tried hanging himself and went unconscious but fell out of the noose and survived. (When hes telling me things it takes me a while to understand what he said because its very jittery and not said in logical english.)

I talked to his dad without J knowing...and lets just say that his parents will be absolutely NO help.

He is extremely scary. I think he is dangerous to be around. He will either hurt himself, his family who he lives with, or others. I just heard that he tried to stab someone I know while he was buying some weed from the guy. I feel bad for being scared of him. I have ghosted him for the past month. What the heck do i do??! I cant speak any sense into him because hes no longer coherent!!! Do I just forget about him and hope for a miracle? Do i report him to the police? I dont want to give up on him, event though my friend is telling me that that is what we need to do. Its not in my nature to give up on a friend, even though in this case its like the friend I once knew isnt even there anymore 

TL;DR my friend is experiencing psychosis and he scares me. Help."
602,I HATE my body,"I (22F) hate my body.  For over six years, I bounced in the same 10lb bubble (135-145lbs).  I was comfortable there.  I gained weight in the winter, lost it in the summer, I was fine.  Within 6 months of graduating college, I have gained 20lbs (165) almost uncontrollably.  I'm in shock.  None of my clothes fit.  I'm disgusted by my reflection.  I'm tired all the time.  I think about self harm as a result of this weight gain regularly.  I even told a close friend that suicide sounded a lot fucking easier than losing the weight.  I dont know what to do.  I'm trying to eat well and excercise, but I am so overwhelmed.  I fucking hate this ugly, terrible body."
603,I feel like screaming my lungs out.,Well the title is self-explanatory.
604,sociology and psychology,"Stigma of mental health. 

Mental health is a serious issue in this modern day of age with about 1 percent of the human population suffering with a serious mental health issue, Schizophrenia. If stigma still remains in modern day pop culture on mental illness, misinterpretation of Psychopathy and ASPD for serial criminals and killers in slasher films or paranoid schizophrenics, the crazy people balding and in padded cells and strapped to tables while screaming like wild animals. If this stigma of mental health continues to increase for the next few years, It might as well belittle the men and woman effected with mental health issues, the most common include but in no particular order;

   Major depressive disorder (Clinical depression) 

   Generalized anxiety disorder 

   Obsessive-Compulsive disorder

   Post-traumatic stress disorder 

   Panic disorder

   Bipolar disorder 

   Borderline personality disorder 

   Specific phobias  

   These stigmas are deeply harmful for the population of people suffering with these mental disorders as I have depression, I face stigma and harassment all the time. I remember wearing a trench coat and walking down the street one weekend and I was harassed by kids as they spotted my cutting scars. They called me a clown and said I was a crazy person and belonged in an asylum which made my mental health worsen. They had no idea that their bullying was bad. 

   Sociology 

   Sociology or as know as social science is a study of the growth of society and what keeps it moving. It specifies with people indefinitely, social class, religion, psychology of community and sexuality. 

   What I have observed in recent times on the TV and in real life, sociologically, the relationship of community to community differs positively or negative to neutral I suppose; like how religious people's relationship to the gay community differs, neutral, positively or negatively based on different subjective opinions. 

   People and mental health. 

   If the stigma continues among the general population and education of mental health is lacking, there will be an increase number of mental disorders. the stigma continues which is obviously a bad thing, this will discourage someone from getting help and leave themselves in the dark of no help. Mental illnesses like depression and anxiety are increasing widely across the globe for many reasons either that someones depression is hereditary or they have not gotten up on their feat from tragedy, other times there is a socioeconomic involvement in depression, that poor people have a higher risk of gaining mental illness than middle-class or rich classes so depression can also cause someone a great deal of problems of getting employed at a job for reasons. The stigma continues and treatment is lacking, there will be a higher risk of mental illness either hereditary, past tragedies or socioeconomic reasons, then indeed the unemployment hypothetically may lead to an economic and socioeconomic collapse in society. Perhaps, though this may be unlikely."
605,Explaining mental health to others,"Anyone know how to explain depression and anxiety to older adults? I am 21, working with 2 older ladies (50+ yrs) in an office and I don't think they understand how greatly it effects me and others with the same issues. They call my generation lazy and sensitive... Which isn't the best thing you want to hear when your having an depressive episode. They just say ""go for a run! You'll feel good as new"" and I internally cringe every time because its far more complicated than just going for a run.."
606,Research Help,"I suffer from anxiety and I’m a filmmaker. As part of my research I would like to ask the community the following question (ideally answered in a sentence). Answers are greatly appreciated, anonymous and will not be used for anything but my own personal research. 

Question: What do you think is the cause or root of your anxiety/mental health issue?"
607,I’m crying in my college bathroom and I feel helpless,"I can’t even make a sound. People keep coming in. I just want to go home, but I have a class in 30 minutes. I don’t know why I always get this way. I’ve had depression for years, I should be used to it. But every time life seems to be going well, a wave of sadness hits me. I take my medication, I have friends, I have a busy schedule, why am I feeling this way? Gosh I hate myself. Please someone, just say anything. I feel so alone."
608,Worried about being a high functioning psychopath,"For as long as I can remember I've always had more violent thoughts and as I think back going through my childhood I definitely had some psychopath signs. I'm not proud of any of these so don't get mad at me saying it's f*cked up. I know, as a kid I didn't feel anything but as an adult... Well I still don't feel anything towards it but I know it's wrong. 

When I was a kid I would get a rush from hurting animals, I threw my cat down the stairs because I wanted to see what it would look like when I did. I would choke a cat or a dog just to see the look it made when I did it. One time, I went into a garden with a bunch of lady bugs on the flowers and used the thorns to disembowel them. I would impale them on the thorns still on the flowers and watch them squirm til they stopped moving the whole time I would get this high feeling. I must've done it to 100 maybe 200 lady bugs in that garden and the rush it gave me, killing ladybugs, throwing an animal down the stairs, choking an animal and seeing the look it its eyes, it all gave me a rush I to this day can't get close to. 

In my teenage years, I would lie all the time to make myself seem more interesting which I think was very common but I lied. Alot. I was in a horrible toxic relationship where I would scream at her and call her fat and hurt her self esteem as much as I could because.... I dont know... I could? She allowed it? She did alot of toxic things to me, cheating, saying hurtful things, starting arguments with me, getting me upset and riled up then pretending she didn't know who I was to make it seem like a stranger came up to her and is now harassing her.  I deserved stuff like that but it wasn't good for my mental health and trying to snap out of my mentality. But did the same things to her in my own way so its not like I didn't deserve what I got. 

I would go on the BestGore site because it would give me that rush again and more and more id visit that page to find more and more messed up videos. Until 2 years ago I banished myself from going on those sites because it was making me worse. 

I don't have a healthy sex life for someone like me. It's all rough violent sex. Telling her she's a hole for my use and that's all her meaning in life is and will be, Hitting her, choking her, sex until she bleeds and can't walk. I don't feel love for her, I don't feel hate either. It's just what she likes and what I feel most natural doing. I met a nice girl who is really into religion and is super sweet and nice but I couldn't fathom that this type of sex would be okay with her but it's the only kind I like. I can't finish unless it turns aggressive. Which I've become worried about.

The reason why I made this post, I've always had an idea I was a psychopath because I got really into mental health and fixing my problems to be a better person. I'm sweet to women and respectful to them. I want them to feel like they can trust me because I don't want to have thoughts and feelings like that that I do now. I don't want to hurt anyone but I do get that feeling of a rush everytime I think of it. That heart racing blood in the water feeling.

The reason I made this post is because I had a really messed up thought that made me go ""Dude, come on, that's really not okay.""

I saw Birds of Prey, the scene where Harley is tied to the chair, I was bored and she's hot, so I had a sexual thought about her. The thought was she'd have to suck dick to get out of the chair. But where it turns messed up is this. She says nothing is going in my mouth, anything that does, is getting bit off. To which the guy says. Okay. And proceeds to break her jaw so she cant close her mouth then use it anyway. It got me hard. I felt bad. I know that's really messed up. I don't like knowing that thought did something to me.

I'm pretty sure im high functioning psychopathic. I have control of myself and I won't ever hurt anyone or take advantage of anybody sexually. I'm just upset that I have these thoughts in general and when I look back at myself I think. Damn. That's something a serial killer would've done as a kid. I'm not going to be a serial killer, if I could I'd go back in time and throw my stupid self down the stairs instead. Is their anybody out there that knows how I feel and have some links to help me? I know I need therapy and I intend on getting it. I didnt do it yet because aside from the really rough sex I thought I was acting pretty normal but that one thought made me go. Most people aren't like this. You need help to get this fixed because it's not okay. Any help would be appreciated and please don't hate me for what I did as a kid. I love animals now and I really feel sick knowing what I did to them. Never killed one or permanently injure one but it's not normal... Thanks.

These are all examples"
609,Worried about mental health from my past,"
Hello! i’m a (20M) last year when I was 19 I was in a such a dark place... I was and still am a virgin... therefore i thought why can’t i get a girlfriend like my mates so i questioned me sexuality by this point, i was so scared of myself i didn’t know what to think... Therefore i spoke to a few lads over snapchat and they asked me to send stuff so i did (wasn’t forced or anything) i wanted to see what my feelings were... After i sent stuff i was so ashamed of myself i could not cope with myself and I shut myself down and hated myself for it , i knew after that day i was 100% straight as i didn’t like it, ive only ever done physical things with women and only ever kissed women , however this really scared me and i can’t seem to get over it as i was petrified that the guys would say anything to my potential girlfriend in the future or any of my mates , they don’t know any of my mates however. I’m also so ashamed in myself as i feel i’m not normal for finding myself out... I finally had the courage to speak to my mum and my mate and they said it’s totally normal to find yourself out they know people who have been through it , i suspect i’ve gone through a “phase” it only lasted a day which is why i thought that... I even went to messaging the lads and telling them i’m sorry and they said “ur defo gay” this really knocked me mentally to me even thinking of taking my own life... however im not as bad now... However i explained to them that I was feeling low and they said it’s just a phase it’s normal because they finally understood what it was doing to me... 6/7 months on and I’m still scared of myself I do have times where I don’t want to be here as when I look at my mates i think am i normal? is it natural? i literally do not feel normal at all !! As well as this i feel as though i won’t be able to go back to my old life before this as i don’t feel it’s worth living almost... I’ve found a girl i really like and i’ve told her and she said it’s in the past now forget it and she said it’s normal but i seriously can’t get over it !!! I’m hoping someone can relate or give any advice of how i’m overreacting!! Thanks"
610,What is wrong with me?,My mental state is very changeable . Sometimes I consider both of committing suicide and starting life again during the same day. I hurt myself emotionally and wanna be hopeless because whenever i have hope i fall down again again and again. I'm sick of this.There is no way me to be happy .i lost something i don't know what it is. I have heartburn every time. I am drowning and anxious. I wanna end this. Please say what's wrong with me.
611,"I’m afraid that years of SSRIs and antidepressants have killed my humanity, and it can get even worse if I ever get off of them.","I just learned about “PSSD” (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction) as well as EMOTIONAL numbing,and even losing the five senses, losing cognitive thinking, etc.

The worst part being that these side effects can be permanent, even years after quitting the medication.

This actually explains a lot for me, I may have never been a real person, just some science experiment/abomination basically, there is no me.

I am 24, I’ve never even had a girlfriend or sex, I’ve been made fun of by countless, online, in school (K-12) telling me how ugly I am, and in school gay and retarded, and worse.

Now I learn that I may never even be physically or mentally capable of experiencing love, sex, or even real friendship, any kind of connection/relationship to another person, or any other emotion. I could even lose the ability to taste, touch, smell, see, hear, and be mentally slow (it seems I already am to some degree).

Apparently these pills can affect your brain this way even from one dose, even if you never take another in your life, and they can even affect people in mere minutes. I can not believe that the US government (ok, I guess I CAN BELIEVE IT) allows this shit to be passed out like candy, without even mentioning these potential side effects, even though they can last FOR LIFE EVEN AFTER QUITTING THIS SHIT!

I know that there is a low chance that I could recover (I’ve never even been drug free except for when I was too little to even remember much) and revert to being human, but I’m scared that after taking them so long, that my brain is already permanently damaged, that there is no me to revert back to, I’m just gone, just permanently something else, something not even human.

I sometimes can’t feel anything in my penis, or when I cum, which makes hope of ever meeting any women pointless, as I won’t be able to enjoy intimacy with her, or even an emotional connection.

I don’t want to live this way. I kept saying that I wanted my sexuality to go away because I can’t get laid, and then I even said that I wish that I couldn’t feel emotions because they’re too painful. I regret wishing this, because many ugly guys, even lazy bums, get women and sex, and even masturbation can be enjoyable, and friendships and other emotions.....

I already felt like such a nonhuman outcast, now it’s even worse, because drugs I was put on when I wasn’t even old enough to consent, have, or very likely will, lobotomize and castrate me, cementing my fate.

I don’t know if God is real, but I’ve cursed him out many times, VERY EXPLICITLY AND VULGARLY, so I wonder if maybe he is real and punishing me. I just can’t believe in something without proof. God, computer programmers if this is a simulation, the universe itself being sentient, I’ve cursed them all out, whether they actually exist or not.

Apparently, psychiatrists very commonly tell people experiencing these effects that it is in their head or that it’s from their depression. My psychiatrist already messes with my meds without any more talking than “are you still feeling depressed, angry, etc. I said yes, and he immediately said “We’ll up this to twice a day”. That was the entire conversation, in and out.

I recently started taking Bupropion SR, which he prescribed, for rage outbursts, I feel I was better off with taking it once a day (100 MG) Twice (200 MG) made my penis and orgasms numb just a few days after starting the double dose). Although last night I felt pleasure, but kept prematurely ejaculating to the JOI I watched, (this virtually always happens when I try to edge) but it still felt good. 

I’m still afraid that if I ever get off these meds, I will suffer from permanent PSSD, as well as losing all emotions. Just Google “ssris pssd and emotional numbing”, if you aren’t already familiar with it.

I’ve been holding some hope that I’m not as unattractive and undesirable (sexually and romantically) as I’ve been led to believe, but if I can’t even feel anything, than that potential for a romantic and sexual relationship is dead.

I won’t even be able to enjoy ANYTHING, I’ll just be an emotionless, nonsexual, robot, zombie, a butchered (previously) human, stripped of all of my humanity by non-natural chemicals that I originally couldn’t even consent to.

I consented to the Bupropion SR, but that one is surprisingly known to NOT cause sexual dysfunction, and even reverse it when caused from other meds, but I’m not sure of what reactions there may be from simultaneously taking it with the others, or if it can restore emotions and other human feelings.

In two years I won’t even be able to remain on my parents health insurance, and I don’t know if I’ll be able to get my own, if any at all at that time.

I now have an even bigger reason to worry about losing my meds, although I’d probably need to get off of them one day anyway, but knowing that I’m very likely to become permanently lobotomized and castrated, I’d rather kill myself, but since it’s technically POSSIBLE that I’ll be OK, humanity intact, it makes sense to at least wait until it actually happens before making a suicide plan.

What would I be supposed to do anyway? Stay on these meds for the rest of my life (if even possible)?

This is just like knowing that Hell is real, and that when you die, you WILL go there, with no possible chance to avoid it. 

I’m starting to feel like all (or at least most) psychiatrists in America are evil pieces of shit."
612,"""Depression taught me how to live again.""","Not sure if this is a good place to put this... apologies if it's not.

I have a friend who's done something brave. She's talking about the mental health issues that have plagued her whole life in a way she never has before. I am endlessly proud of her, and what she's doing, and how she's doing it, because I have witnessed a small part of the struggle, and the small part I've seen has been monumental. Now all she wants to do is be strong in herself (amazing) and help others on her journey wherever she can. Gets me a bit choked up if I'm honest. 

She posts occasionally on her YouTube channel, and this one's really something special. It's [here](https://youtu.be/3heiZ50wfYk) if anyone wants to take a look."
613,Is it bad that I feel like I'm on drugs when I take vyvanse?,"I have ADHD and I take vyvanse, I love how much it helps with my grades, focus, and overall happiness, it's just that I feel like it does ""Too much"". I enjoy the feeling it gives me, but i get a feeling of intense focus, and relaxation. When I took Concerta I didnt even feel close to how I do with vyvanse. Vyvanse also gives me intense bursts of energy, which makes me more motivated to do things, and gives me a goal that I cam actually comprehend. I just feel like I cant do anything without vyvanse, which I generally cant and I feel like one day I'll get so addicted to vyvanse that I will OD, and I dont want that to happen, I'm strongly against drugs, and I would disown anyone who takes drugs which isnt a good habbit, but it is due to childhood experience. I dont want to become the person that I despise, is it bad that I feel like I do on vyvanse, or is it actually what it feels like to not have ADHD?"

Every day im depressed and only hoping to get through another week. But im not sure how long I can last. And I dont know where else to turn. 

Every day is mind numbing anxiety. Anxiety has ruled my life for over 10 years. This feels like my last chance at a normal life and im hanging on by a thread. I dont know what else to write even though theres much more to share. I just wish I had support in real life outside of my parents (who can sometimes be very unsupportive).

615,it’s getting heavy again,"some background: 
i’m a 25 y/o female. recently moved into my first apartment by myself which i always wanted. i have a small, but good, group of friends. and i’m currently dating someone who makes me happy. 

i have struggled with depression and anxiety for the last 10 years. i’m currently on effexor xr and have been for last 1-2 years.

i was feeling on top of the world... i got everything i wanted (on paper). i have my own home, a car, a cute puppy, a solid best friend, and a boyfriend who cares about my feelings. but recently, the last 3 or so months, i have been so depressed. i forgot how horrible this feels since my SNRI has significantly improved my quality of life. i don’t know what to do. i can’t pretend to act like i’m fine, but i don’t want to constantly drag my friends down by talking about the same thing again and again. this leads me to isolating myself which i know makes things worse. i’m feeling overwhelmed by the thought of having chronic depression and always feeling like this. i’m dissociating a lot lately too and it’s all getting too much to handle. i’m not sure what to do.. i have already made an appointment to talk to my doctor about my dosage, and have tried therapy since i realized this mood wasn’t just a bad few days. 

for the time being, i am not feeling motivated at all to do anything. i feel so weighted down and i can’t shake it. i’m so overwhelmed and exhausted of this. 

any advice?:("
616,Im screwed up..,"I am so hopeless that things will never get better. Everyday i find out that i have probably more diagnosis than have already been made with me.

Like how fucked up can i be even more. Am i that weird? I also thought that i was kind of normal but hearing and getting all these labels makes me so insecure of who i am as a person. Like there is a big huge flaw in me and who i am, so imperfect. I forget things so easily and when i am in a bad state i want to discuss the state with my psychiatrist. But as soon as i have the appointment i think ‘i was over exaggerating, i feel fine now’, and cant really come to terms with how i actually felt because i forget the intensity of the feeling i had at that time. I cant really place myself back in that ‘insane state/depression’. I feel so lonely, even though i have friends, i dont know what to do anymore &amp; feel so so so lost."
617,Today's Mental Health Help,"This is no trick or scam. I'm not asking for money. All I'm getting out of this is experience and helping others.

Who wants to discuss openly: their mental health troubles that are stopping them from their goals, are open to try new things from an unbiased person; life changing things I know that have impacted others on this forum; and understands this will only work if you welcome change (including things you may or may not be doing preventing you from reaching your goals)?"
618,To Medicate or not to medicate; that is the question,"So I have been doing therapy since I was 13. I am now 25. I have always believed I can overcome my shit without meds. That doing intensive and consistent therapy would help and going to college for psychology learned that most psych meds really aren't supposed to be taken for your whole life. Over the years my health care professionals have always recommended or suggested I take something to help me but I have always refused. I agreed for a short period of time but the meds made me feel stunted, muted and not myself. I don't like putting chemicals in my body (I legit have to have a fever to even take tylenol) and on top of that I've seen my father take fist-fulls of anti depressants (along with many other things) my whole life so I'm just not too jazzed about the whole thing. The process has been a nightmare with insurance and getting the run around. I think we finally have it straightened out but I think I'm chickening out. IDK. I just read a post on this thread about how meds legit made this dude wholfully apathetic and without a sex drive essentially permanently and now I'm freaking out.

If you have any advice or personal stories either that meds helped or hurt it would be greatly appreciated!"
619,(tw) I can't stop my sister from cutting herself,"Please this is full of triggers if you will lie triggered please don't read this I can't handle the guilt if I triggered anyone.

I don't know what to do,  I tried everything. My heart is breaking everyday.
By no mean I'm trying to make this about me I'm just sharing my feelings.

My sister is 16 yo, she is the most affectionate person I know,  every feeling she has is multiplied by 100.
Two years ago we discovered scars on her forearm and we all freaked out. I cried and called her names and handled the situation very badly.
After that we had a talk and she told something I will never forget (I try to replace the mental pain with physical pain).
We agreed she will stop and we will support her when she slips just don't hide anything from us and don't lie to us.
Only to find out year later that she stopped cutting her arms and started cutting her thighs
I will never forget the sight of the fresh wounds all over her thighs.
You should know that my sister is slightly overweight, and she doesn't like to get out of the house because she think she is ugly plus she has terrible anxiety and paranoia tendency.
We decided to give her the year off and take a break from school last year 
She got really better and stopped cutting but once we started the school this year (home schooling because we didn't think she is ready for the outside world yet) the very least things triggered her into cutting again. 
The studying and the isolation from everyone made her case worst
Now we are in the second term of this year,  and we are trying to get her back to school because she is becoming very dependent, spoiled and more depressed but she keeps crying and sleeps all day.  
What should we do I'm very scared if we made her go to school she will start cutting again 
(we are trying to convince her with therapy but she doesn't want too) 
Should we force her to go to school or therapy? 
I don't want to stand their watching her ruining her life because we are afraid of her cutting herself 
Please tell me what to do"
620,question on Cymbalta,"my doctor somehow really wants me to try  Cymbalta . I am not depressed, I am however have anxiety and issues dealing with stress. I would hate it if  Cymbalta  damages my body in other ways and/or hard to get off later on. But other than that I don't mind trying something just to see what it does. 

How much risk is there?

Thanks!"
621,I'm not even a teenager yet and i'm already suicidal.,"(sorry if this is hard to read/if the layout is bad. i'm bad with things like this)

ok so, i (13) have sort of been struggling with whatever this is that's going on right now. i dunno if it's abuse or if i'm overreacting but i really fucking hate my sister (17)

ever since i've been a child, i've always felt like she hates me? maybe she's jealous? or she just doesn't like me. 

Because of our big age gap we've never been very close until the past year or two. I've started to understand that my sister is struggling with mental health issues (depression, anxiety, bpd, ocd, etc.) i've always known about everything going on with her and that sometimes she acts out because of it. her medication helps sometimes ig. 

Sometimes we're doing well and then sometimes she yells at me, insults me and makes me feel horrible for not doing minor things for her. The shit she says really hurts me. She points flaws out at any given time, can't accept when she doesn't win and can not accept that she's not always right. despite her being 18 in like less than 4 months, she has no career path and doesn't even clean her own room. but I am the lazy one?

moving on from her, my mom. I don't really know how to describe this but my mom overreacts at little things when she's mad about something else. she yells, insults me and just makes me feel horrible. 

example; she wanted me to google someone's number today. ok cool. i'm looking for my glasses because it's early in the morning, i just woke up and i cannot see. (i have REALLY bad eyes) so i'm taking a little while and i understand that she's in a hurry so i take less than like two minutes right?

she yells at me, calls me selfish and then just starts yelling a bunch of bullshit. Me, being me is on the verge of tears and she ends up just using my sisters phone :/

christmas 2019, she gets drunk and starts arguing with people and ends up getting into an altercation?? i guess, with my grandma and i take a panic attack. (which i've been taking for months but she doesn't do shit about it because fuck me) she knows that it affected me. everyone else got an apology besides me. she ruined christmas and made me take a panic attack whilst she left and walked home alone. 

i'm feeling really suicidal. i don't know what to do. i can't go to any other family members house to stay. 

(my dad isn't in the picture, my grandma lives in a small two bedroom house and is living with my cousin (15) and currently taking care of a 2 year old as well as working full time, my other family wouldn't take me in because i hardly know them lol) 

my attendance at school is horrible so my guidance counsellor is offering things to get me back in school. like an actual counsellor and i don't wanna waste their time and my mom would know and be like ""you don't need that"" if i told the counsellor about anything that's going on in my head i know that it wouldn't be just between us. 

i just want someone to care about me and not make me feel like shit and then ask me ""are you alright?"" ten minutes later and only accept the answer yes. 

i don't want people to think i'm a little kid who's overreacting. i'm not. or maybe i am? i dunno. i just can't wait to get away from these people because they're driving me insane."
622,Having a hard time being honest with my therapist. Any advice?,"So I've been seeing the same therapist for almost 7 years now. I originally started therapy for an eating disorder but I also had depression and severe social anxiety. I was definitely reluctant to tell my therapist things at because I was afraid she would tell my parents or something but over the years I've really learned to trust her. 

Now in therapy we focus more on my anxiety and being successful in college/life stuff. I tend to get in a weird cycle of skipping class, getting anxious about missing class, and then missing more class because going back makes me anxious. However recently I've had a harder time telling my therapist what I'm struggling with. Maybe because it's so embarrassing and feels really inexplicable to me. I don't know why I keep doing this over and over again. I know it makes me feel bad and do bad in school but it keeps happening. I've been having the same issue for like 2 years now and I feel like my therapist is done with my shit. A couple weeks ago she asked if I should do a medical withdraw for the semester and I'm afraid if I tell her how much of a problem I'm having she'll push me to do that. I don't want to take a semester off because I'd have to explain it to my family and I don't even know what I'd do other than stay at home and feel bad about myself. And I don't want my therpaist to be mad at me for not following through and going to class because I feel bad enough already.

In my regular life I have a tendency to lie about little things just because it's what the other person wants to hear and I'm noticing that it's starting to creep into therapy. Last week I lied and said I went to all of my classes when I missed one. It's such a stupid thing to do because really the only person I'm hurting is myself but it's still really hard. I just don't want to admit to continuing to have the same stupid problem with a really obvious solution that I for some reason am not doing.

tldr: I like my therapist who I've been seeing for a while but now am having trouble being honest with her. What do I do? Any advice to tell the truth?"
623,Should I Tell My Doctor About My Mental Health?,"I have a doctors appointment tomorrow and I’m wondering if I should let my doctors know about my mental health past I haven’t been to the doctors in over three years and only reason I’m going is because I went to an urgent care for breathing problems and they told me that I need to talk to a pulmonologist and I need a referral so I have to go see my doctor. But I don’t know if you wanna let them know about the mental issues I’ve been having for the past couple years. I’ve been diagnosed with some things but I’m scared that if I tell my primary care doctor it’ll follow me everywhere. Like it might prevent me from buying some guns in the future. But I’m thinking that I might still tell them just because I’ve been hospitalized nine times last year and eight of them were because of a pink slip and I know the pink slip stay on your record unless you voluntarily sign in which I never do so I feel like it’s already on my record but I don’t know that for sure and I don’t want to screw myself over by thinking is on my record and it’s not but then I end up putting it on my record . I know some people say it’s sealed and  they can’t get it without my permission but let’s be honest certain things if they see any hint of it on your record than I want be able to do what I want. Like for me personally I’d like to get a couple guns (pistols,riffles,semi automatics)and I feel like if they read my mental health past they’re not going to let me do that (suicidal/homicidal, hallucinations/psychosis, etc). This is one of the main reasons why I don’t have a therapist and I don’t take any prescription meds because once you start talking to people you become your diagnosis. It follows you around everywhere any doctor that has access to see it will forever treat you like your diagnosis you can never escape it. I don’t want to follow me around everywhere I go because at that point I’d rather just kill myself to let that happen."
624,Mental Health In School,"The school system today is very unfriendly to students who suffer from mental illness. It's hard to keep up with all the tests and assignments, and the way they pressure us is extremely stressing and anxiety inducing... for someone who struggles with mental illness it feels ten times harder to cope with that.
I'm so depressed and so tired (because of sleep problems) and right now I have so much to study that I simply cannot handle it. I feel behind no matter what and altough I'm sure I'm intelligent, my grades will suffer because of the way the system works. I'm complaining a lot, but I'm simply mad because I try so hard and I still feel like I can never relax and stop worrying so much and get decent grades."

Im afraid when i ask for help all I’m going to get is man up and get on With  it but this isn’t what i want to hear..."
626,I think I may have had a break or something,"After taking a bit of an edible. I was chilling in the living room when I started to hear a running commentary of sorts between my aunts in the other room. And they were narrating almost exactly the criticism I feel for myself, as well as what I was doing on my phone as if they could see what I was doing on it, like screenwatching it somehow. I looked up that maybe they could be using a program called most, but don’t know how they would’ve gained accesses to my phone unless they can do it exclusively through me connecting to the WiFi. The criticisms just kept coming, but what they were saying was almost shifting with how I was feelings, and what I was doing. They usually constantly commentate about a soap opera that they’re watching. Is it possible this is a front so I don’t catch on to them talking about what I’m doing. And after what felt like 2 hours or so I dozed off and just woke up about 40 mins ago. I can’t tell if what they said was real or not. I had broke into tear after about 40 mins of hearing the criticism because they were cutting deep, and it seems like they know me more than I know myself, or at least know what I thought of myself. 
On one hand I don’t believe they would bother to do this over complicated spying on me, but in the other I really don’t want to be crazy because it felt too real. As far as I know none of my family have mental health issues, and I’ve never reacted to getting high this way. I get paranoia occasionally but never outright heard things. I know that they had to be talking though."

Meanwhile I basically fantasise about death because to me it’s peace, no sound, no sight, no touch, no smells, no thoughts, no perception (atleast my belief). Even if I stay alive as to not hurt people I’d rather just find a place in the middle of nowhere and die eventually in some peace and quiet. I’ve tried plenty of therapy that never really worked. I don’t know why I’m making this post but I just felt like it."

629,I diagnosed myself with Histrionic Personality Disorder? Here is how. Does that work?,"Hello there! I hope you are doing great! 

in 2018, my girlfriend left me because she said I was narcissistic and I didn't love her. I had doubts about who I was and since then I got interested in personality disorders and mental disorders. But I have recently discovered histrionic personality disorder and everything flashed back  at me and made I am so confused. I remember all the things I have been doing in my adult life, the people I am surrounded by, the decisions I have made, all made me bewildered. I am suffering from many types of addiction and I have nihilistic and suicidal thoughts. That has been before I knew that but the tendency of having those thoughts increased when I realized that. Yet I am not certain of this and I want to listen to a second hand opinion, to which I am posting here. I can't go to a therapist because I can't trust anyone, at least therapists in my region. Mental health therapy in my country is of very low quality. 

 There is a key term in HPD, ""pervasive"" excessive emotionality and attention-seeking. That's what I have always rooming in my mind. I thrive when I am being the center of attention and when I realized that I started to reduce seeking attention by not posting personal pictures on social media and being reserved about the things I did, but now I realize, because I repressed that it made me even more uncomfortable. There are symptoms that don't match with, so let me detail on that by examining each of the symptoms: 

1. HPD is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention. I relate to that. It explains why I've always felt happy when I had a group conversation and I was the one speaking the most, or when I teach (I am a teacher) or when I am invited to speak at an event. I feel the opposite when I am not the life of the party. 
2. interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior. That doesn't line up with me. I wear casual minimalistic clothes. I have a deep desire of wanting to attract women but I don't provoke. 
3. displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions. That happens very often. I can be very happy in a moment and if I meet someone, watch a video or get affected by something my mood changes. 
4. consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to self. I do that by constantly adjusting my posture and if I am around women, I have the thought that they are looking at me and they would find me attractive. 
5. has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail. That's not me, too. I have joined a debate club years ago and I learned from that how to be precise in my speech and how to organize my ideas logically. But I think when I speak I try to impress, either by using jargon words or by using many examples or stating that I have done a lot of research on the topic. But I try to control that all the time, so I add words like ""I don't know"", ""I think that"". The tendency is there but I can control it sometimes
6. shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion. I relate to that, too. I play the guitar and I try singing different genres. I speak with exaggerated analogies and I laugh so loud and try to exaggerate my emotions and what happened. 
7. is suggestible, i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances. That's me, so many times.
8. considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. I can remember I did that many times in the past and I considered some people my best friends while they live far from me and I have never shared a secret with them. 
9. I have also read that HPD people change professions and are easily bored. I have tried dozens of occupations and I have tried to learn dozens of skills but failed to succeed in any. 

I hope you've made it here. What are your thoughts?"
630,The Age Issue,"I won’t disclosed the username, but after my controversial post about incels I had quite a lot of incels that messaged me. 

One of them that message me basically said that young people can’t have mental disorders or experienced trauma which of course isn’t true. He was very dissmive. 

How I got onto that’s topic is a little of a long story, but long story short is that post is very indirect and effective way of describing guys I encounter during my time on the internet. 

Back on that topic, I am almost an adult, and what I experienced throughout the years felt like hell.

At three year old I was kidnapped by crackhead neighbors. At 9, I starting have weird thoughts about blood and cut myself just to see it. From fifth grade to seventh grade I was bullied and didn’t have many friends. At 15...there some extremely heavy stuff, but I was sexually harassed by creepy, older guys. Also, my boyfriend threatened to rape me because I broke up with him for not respecting certain wishes that I had. One of those wishes were not to have sex. Also, two guys I liked when I was 15 killed themselves. One of them I do blame myself for. 

At 16, I lost my home due to natural disaster, along with developing more mental health issues. I lost a giant part of me, my home which resembles my privacy and need for piece, so I was scared of losing other things. I became so paranoid that all of my friends and family hated me, so I slowly pushed them away one by one. Right now, I have nobody in real life that I’m close to anymore. I’m scared of real relationships and attachment that I just either watch shows, work, or focus on hobbies that I’ll never be good at. And that’s my fault I’m alone. I attacked  people or ignored them to the point that they just move on from me.

Even now with me realizing that things  I did was my fault, and trying to reach out to more people...I still haven’t got my shit together and don’t think I’m ever will. All I care about is my success now which doesn’t mean shit anymore which I have nobody that will be proud of me, and encourage me even when the light at the end of the tunnel seems so dim.

Imagine only academics and career being your only reasons to live. Not friends, not families, and worried about still being to hurt to even find a long-term partner in the future. Who will be there for me? No one, that’s who. 

For those who says young people can not  experience trauma are fucking dumb as shit. We can be abused, kidnapped, trafficked, suicidal, bullied, raped, assaulted, groomed, and more. If we have emotions, then we can go through almost anything."

632,I need to go to a therapist but am lacking the motivation,"I've had a rocky past year with my parents which resulted in me being kicked out (I've explained this many times so if you want to know the full story look at my account). I think I might have bipolar disorder and I know I need to see a therapist but I can't motivate myself to do it. I put so much on my boyfriend and am having panic attacks or anxiety attacks almost daily, i also get the urge to self harm or even end my life. I feel so selfish but it just feels like can't go. I do the same thing with doctors I just don't like it, I don't know if they are going to get me on meds or if I'll just have to live with it my whole life. I'm so scared and uncertain of the future I barely have anything and it's terrifying and I don't know how much longer I can keep it up before I start to loose it."

634,I’m drowning and need help!,"(20f) For the past 2-3 years I’ve been suffering from severe depression. I cannot afford professional help by any means. So I tried doing other things to help cope such as journaling, exercise/diet change, meeting new people, distancing myself from people, new job, started new hobbies, but nothing seems to work. It’s gotten worse within the past year, so much so that I question my motivation to live. How do I get over this? How get my will to live again? How do I know I’m truly happy or if it’s a mind placebo? In the past I’ve done self harm and that oddly enough made me feel better by making me feel something in some kind of form. But I know that doesn’t just hurt but it hurts my loved ones too. Please! How do I not go back to my old ways again? HELP!!!"
635,Constant tiredness and struggling to get moving,"I often feel fatigued, sleeping eight hours a night I assume I should be feeling rejuvenated and full of energy but I’m not. I force myself to workout and diet and while it’s been going well I struggle with other areas such as laying around and being lazy most of the time. Sometimes when I have a stressful day of work and have bad social anxiety it’ll seem like I just woke up with how groggy I am even if it’s late afternoon. I don’t know what to make of this and am struggling to fix it."

637,Recommendations,"I'm at a point where I have zero real freinds or people who give a crap about me because of various reasons.

Can anyone recommend good way to meet new people other online or irl just to really chat and nothing more. The loneliness I have experienced over the last 2 ish months is finally starting to kill me."
638,I dream about being violently murdered?,"I’ve had several dreams in the past few months where I’m violently murdered or maimed. Shot, stabbed, shot and stabbed, crushed to death, exploded, etc. These dreams always seem so real and I legitimately fear for my life. My dream last night had me being kidnapped by a cult and about to be sacrificed before I stabbed a guy with a fork and ran for my life.

Along with these dreams, I frequently get sleep paralysis. I used to see/hear dark figures or “demonic” presences. I even had a conversation inside my head with some raspy voice during a bout of sleep paralysis. 

I just find it odd that they occur more frequently. Is this something I should be concerned about?"
639,I am looking for a specific type of therapy,"I decided that I finally need to go to therapy and actually try to benefit from it. I recently had to put a relationship on hold because both myself and my boyfriend realized my last relationship made me incredibly codependent. That, among other things and talking to my therapist cousin, leads me to feel like emotionally focused therapy would help me. However I don’t know if I can just see any therapist and suggest this, or if I have to seek a specific one out. Could anyone help here? I am in the US."
640,Advice for a move,"I am moving to a different state by myself for the first time ever at the end of the month.

I have no friends in the new city save some internet folks I follow but I have a secure job set up and a plan for school. 

I am a natural born procrastinator and am unsurprisingly prone to severe anxiety in times of change like this. Right now I can feel myself shutting down and am so so worried about getting this apartment rid of things I’m not taking with me and generally getting it clean. I know I have enough time in theory but in reality I feel like every little thing is taking too long and that I’m gonna fuck this up somehow. I don’t know what the point of this post is just wanted to see if anyone else has gone through something similar rn.

I am very much starting on my life and getting things done finally but I’m mostly alone and I’m so so scared"
641,"Hit by a car, struggling with coping.","I was a pedestrian in a crosswalk and I was hit by a vehicle from behind going 50km/hr. I flipped over the vehicle, hit the roof and landed 2 meters away on the ground. 

This happened this valentine's day.
I'm struggling with continously relaying the incident in my head and realizing I almost died. I have been repeatedly telling people i love them, I was never an emotionally open person. I've been struggling with disassociating as well. Ive not accepted fully what's happened and I am all over the place mentally but not crying or saddened. Just scared. 

I want to talk to a professional once I am able to move off bedrest. Until then how can I cope?"
642,Moving Forward With my Mental Health Issues,"First, ignore my username, it was made a year or so ago when I was falling apart. 

I'm a 19 year old male who's past few years and present have been plagued with mental health issues. My mental health problems began to creep in lightly around the start of grade 9, and gradually got worse with each year with them drastically starting to get worse towards the end of high school. They got so bad to the point where around this time last year (2019 Jan-Feb) I would begin to physically beat myself and would leave noticeable bruises. *This was triggered by me not knowing what I wanted to become in the future, by not knowing what I liked or why I actually never enjoyed anything. Those two things were enough for my self hatred to take over myself in massive amounts. During these moments, I always got so fed up with myself for being born as me, and would ask myself ""why me? why couldn't I just be someone else?"" The inferiority  I sensed in myself when compared to others was just more fuel to the fire. This lead the self hatred to boil over and get me so frustrated and upset with myself that I would end up beating myself and leaving bruises out of shear self hatred.* 

&amp;#x200B;

I have friends that I would talk to  (and still do) when things would go south, they would help, but after a while the negative mental state would creep right back in. 

For the rest of 2019, I was a mess. my mental state was polluted and the urge to self harm was frequent but nothing rampant. So much despair to the point that I thought suicide may actually be on the timeline of my short lived existence.  I was constantly stressed out, frustrated and angry at myself for being what I was. Mid-2019, I decided, I needed a job for the time being rather than just sitting around in despair. I applied to a job I had my eye on and got called to the interview, I felt happy, having a job meant my own money, a new computer I could build and more. Long story short I got the job, and was pumped for my first day but also nervous. Seems normal. As the days went on, I realized I really liked working, the people were great, the pace was nice you name it. But I also discovered something else unfortunate regarding my mental health. I would be working, and out of the blue, a thought would pop into my mind, a thought that would cause my mental state to become a wasteland. ""But what are you going to do in the future?"" This caused a feeling that I hate, the feeling of everything going well and being fairly happy and then all of that just gets taken away in seconds - replaced by despair, stress and self hatred. It doesn't help that I never really have been all that good in school anyways despite me always trying my best no matter how much I hated the course, the outcome would be the same even back then too - which would only further my sense of inferiority. This seem out of order right? How I went from me working right to my performance in high school? Yep, that's about the best I can put anybody reading this, into my shoes in those moments. It changes in a snap,  just like  my mental state. 

But I discovered something else too and I guess it always was discovered by me but now solidified. If I made a mistake, that regardless of the size, I would find it incredibly difficult to forgive myself for it. If I was doing well at something and made a mistake, it destroys my confidence for future rounds of that same task making me question myself. Further enforcing the sense of inferiority I have in myself furthering my self hatred as well. 

Coming close to the end of 2019, the bad mental state from earlier that year was creeping back for the same reason. And come 2020, it 100% returned. The feelings of inferiority, confusion and being lost about what to become, polluting my mental state into become a wasteland had returned. This time I didn't beat myself but more so just lived in stress for the next few weeks. I had trouble sleeping, I was a mess at work and couldn't focus on anything, hell I found a game that I really wanted to play because I found it interesting and I couldn't even properly enjoy that because my mind would always be a mess from that one question on what to become. 

One late night, I decided, enough is enough.  I was tired of being pushed around by my mental health problems, tired that I could NEVER focus on anything or enjoy things I genuinely wanted to do. I got out a sheet of paper, and began listing down my mental health problems and things that I think need work. I IMMEDIATELY, felt better.  Like a weight was taken off. 

That list of problems: 

Overthinking (in progress)

Beating up myself over every mistake no matter how small (in progress) 

Severe self comparison to my peers around me frequently

Very harsh self critic that needs to be tamed

Letting other peoples opinions guide my life, decisions and enjoyment in things I may like 

Caring too much about what other people think

Can rarely accept compliments

Can't find peace with myself 

Resentfulness

Self Hatred

(Will add to this list the more problems I discover)

Fairly long list, but one that I have begun progress on. Problem by problem, before I proceed with my life, I want find a fix to them and understand why I feel like that and possibly avoid a lethal end. In fact, I feel like the problem with over thinking has already got a bit better since beginning to address it, I can recognize when I'm over thinking and cancel out the thought with persistence and actually pretty quickly too - but I feel like it needs some work still as it could be better. Due to this my performance at work has also increased to the point of people complimenting me frequently on how efficiently I work since I can put my full attention into a given task. Another thing I discovered at work a few weeks ago, was that I still can excel at something I don't like doing and that the satisfaction of doing it correctly would be enough to make up the deficit for me not liking the task beforehand, which set some tones for me and made me feel a bit more confident. 

My urge to self harm reduced from mid 2019 to now. I am able to control my actions towards myself and actually have not beat myself in months. 

Today I boiled over once more, but not in the bad way, I gained enough confidence to tell myself I was gonna fuck up each one of those problems sooner or later. That I was coming for them. That they have no control or right to possess me in the way they do in almost a daily basis. No longer are they going to keep me from doing things I want to achieve, enjoy or affect a positive mental state. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was just wondering if anybody on reddit could give me some tips or have experienced any of those issues and how they overcame it? Thanks!"
643,I've been feeling hopeless for months and today was different,"The weather has been overcast and bitter for months and it snowed pretty heavily a week ago. Today the snow has almost finished melting, it was almost 60°F, and the sun shined through the clouds a bit. I've been feeling really hopeless because things got worse for me mentally right as it started to get cold, but now things are starting to thaw and I feel a glimmer of hope."
644,Numb Emotionally,"For years I have been trying to regain my positive emotions. I struggle with only feeling negativity on a daily basis and its becoming harder to find happiness in things. Ive experienced alot of loss, being cheated on, treated like I dont matter. I just want some advice on how I can heal effectively and feel things other than negative emotions."
645,Venting.,"Some clarification: I'm a 15 yr old who moved to UK almost a year ago.

Some problems:

-Self harm(cutting)
-Self hatred(for like 3 or 4 years)
-Bitter
-Isolated myself in school
-Hate everything
-Gave up on everything
-I can still feel happyness and laugh at something, but after a moment of happiness I return to feeling dull
-Hate my existance, but scared of killing myself
-Feel worthless
-Recently, it's gettinf a bit hard to get out of bed
-Hobbies feel empty

This isn't a cry for help or for attention.
I just wanted to vent somewhere where I won't be judged. And no, I won't tell anyone Irl about any of this.
Since I'm on a break I'm feeling a bit better. Last month during school I was a emotional wreck. Although these problems are still here.
Anyway, thanks for reading."
646,Can anybody provide some support?,"There is a sub that seems to be very dangerous. It is against the mental health industry, and can brainwash ill people to not seek treatment. Which seems like they already did.

What can I do about it? Is reporting it enough?"
647,I’m rotting from the inside-out (Vent),"Somedays, I’m not sure how to help myself. I feel inadequate. I feel like a burden to my loved ones and boyfriend, because I’m constantly under so much stress from training to go into the emergency responder field (which is like very rigid military style training).
I seem to have a difficult time dealing with this stress, whether it be blocking it out, my inability to realize it, or cutting myself off from everyone and having depressive episodes. And I feel awful...my poor family and boyfriend, having to deal with me, subjecting them to my troubles and my strife. I feel like I drain them and burden them...and I don’t want to do that at all.


But I don’t know how to be decent anymore.
I don’t feel happy anymore. Im constantly anxious and depressed and I have trouble doing simple things. I can feel myself half-assing my way through everyday. I’m not confident in myself anymore and it feels as if my intelligence has dropped significantly. I can’t think clearly or comprehend things easily. It’s hard for me to grasp certain concepts. I feel like I always have a brain fog, even when I’m perfectly hydrated and have gotten enough sleep. I feel stupid and slow. 
In addition, my emotions have been all over the place...it’s hard to know what will and what won’t set me off anymore.


I don’t know what’s happening to me, but I can feel myself rotting from the inside-out. I feel like I’m deteriorating and falling apart. I never used to be like this. The worst part is that I don’t know why it’s happening or how to fix it.
I’m not sure how to get the help I need...and for some reason I’m apprehensive about it, but I do want to get better. I just want to do the right thing. I just want to be happy and comfortable with myself again.


And sometimes I wonder if it’s from my ADHD (which for me, causes a LOT of anxiety and/or depression), my PTSD, or the several concussions I’ve had within the past year that are affecting my head. Or maybe if I had grown up differently, in a better environment that wasn’t so fucked up, maybe I could have been a better person.

But that doesn’t matter, because I can’t really fix those things.

I need help. I want to be myself again. 

I want to be happy again.


P.s. If anyone could share their mental health tips/coping mechanisms/resources (I’m from the US) I would greatly appreciate it. And for those who may ask, yes, I have made a future appointment with my therapist and will be going weekly. This is just something I’ve been feeling for weeks and I really just needed to get it out somewhere.
So...thank you. To anyone that read this. I appreciate you."
648,"I’ve hated myself for my entire life, and I don’t know why","This is a weird post, but I really need this off my chest. I’ve hated myself for my entire life, and it’s getting to the point where I think there is a deeper reason to why. Many friends have helped me, and I have genuinely tried to love myself but nothing works. I’ll explain some more. I genuinely feel like the ugliest person in the world, every single facial feature I have is wrong, no matter how small, I can’t even look in the mirror anymore because I’ll just break down into tears. I have cut out most of my friends, avoid my boyfriend, and avoid talking to people, because I feel like they would be embarrassed of talking to someone just as ugly as me. People have told me that I’m pretty in the past, but I know they are lying. They’re just saying it for some personal gain. I genuinely want to live an isolated life because I don’t want to burden people, they would be ashamed of me, and how ugly I am. And I have been through a lot of changes, I’ve lost a lot of weight, gained a lot of weight, but no matter what I seem to do I will never be good enough. I am not perfect, and everything about me is wrong. I’m trying to save up for a lot of plastic surgery, and trying to workout again, but avoid my friends, social gatherings and my boyfriend at all costs, they deserve prettier friends. 

I’m sorry if this came off as a mismatched mess of information, this has been on my chest for awhile and I sorta just poured it out onto this post. I really needed to say this so thanks for listening, and I am open to hear advice."
649,I keep hearing people saying my name,Even when I’m alone. It’s almost like it’s through an old badly tuned radio but I keep hearing it multiple times a day. I’ve been to a few sessions but I haven’t mentioned this. I don’t know if I need advice but I need to get this off my chest
650,What is this behavior?,"I work with my father, and I'm trying to understand his behavior. A very uncomfortable scenario played out today.

\~

In passing, I began a conversation with a co-worker. My father saw us, and said ""hey dream, come over here"".

I walk over. ""Yes?""

""I need you two to stop messing around.""

""Um, ok."" I feel my skin begin to flush. I'm uncomfortable.

""Now don't get offended"" (I'm not offended) ""I just see you two over there. I see you two over at the machine talking.""

I start to involuntarily defend myself a bit. ""Well, I thought we were pretty good with staying on task..I..""

""You're fine, it's him, I need him to focus. You're over there working, he's not. I need you to step up and leave him alone.""

""Uhh....ok, yeah.""

\~

As I walk away I think, wait... why am I being talking to alone, especially if ""he's the problem""? Why weren't we both? In a moment of courage (I usually do not express these sort of things), I decided to express this thought because i thought it was a fair.

I head back over. I calmly ask if he plans to talk to Co-worker too, as I felt it made sense to talk to both of us. He gets very visibly upset, and says ""I'm not having this conversation"".

His demeanor is extremely cold to me after this.

Fine. Whatever. I just feel glad that I expressed my thought.

I make sure to not mingle with Co-worker. I do take his request seriously, and I want him to know that.

Near the end of the day, the inevitable retaliation begins.

\~

I am attempting to write this as close to the real conversation as possible.

\~

He calls me over.

Father: ""When I'm trying to tell you something I don't appreciate you to coming back to tell me \[references earlier\]""

OP: ""I just didn't get why if it's both of us causing an issue, and most especially Co-worker as you said, why I'm individually being talked to. I felt a bit singled out.""

I am *enormously* uncomfortable at this moment.

F: ""You're not being singled out. You know you're not being singled out. I'm just trying to tell you something.""

OP: ""And I hear you. I'm not opposed to what you said. I just wanted to express how I felt.""

F: ""When I tell you something I don't except you to tell me how you feel about it, I expect you to man up, and say OK.""

OP: ""I was, but I think I should be able to ask questions too?""

F: ""You can.....""

OP: ""But....you just said that's what you didn't want me doing?""

F: ""Ok, that's not what I said. You know what..."" Starts to walk away.

I walk after him.

OP: ""Didn't you just say when you tell me something, you don't want me to have a response, you just want me to say OK.""

F: ""I expect a little more out of you, yes.""

OP: ""That's where I'm confused...I was just telling you how I felt""

F: ""And that's all I'm doing.""

I'm having difficult keeping up with the conversation at this point.

OP: ""What?""

F: ""I'm just trying to tell you how I feel too.""

OP: ""Ok, I want you to do that.""

F: ""Ok.""

(awkward pause)

OP: ""I'm confused...""

F: ""You're telling me how you feel, and I'm telling you how I feel""

He smiles after saying this. And my brain is melting at this point.

OP: ""Ok?""

F: ""Ok.""

He's pretty fucking pissed with me now. I just don't understand. Could this be mental health related?"
651,Why do I have evil thoughts all the time?,It happeneds all the time randomly. The thoughts are basically what would happen if I kill/rape/ inappropriate touching/ punch in the face/ stomp on them/ etc. I would never do any of it and I hate having these thoughts.
652,Did your antidepressants change your personality/emotions?,"So... I‘ve been struggling with depression for over 10 years now and recently I‘ve been diagnosed with borderline (this was no news to me though, it just became “official”). Now, for the first time, I’m taking meds (SSRIs, Sertraline fyi) and I am a little bit terrified if they somehow are going to change my personality or make me numb.

Are these thoughts understandable?

654,Do you think it is really important if your therapist is either a man or a woman?,I’m a 23 y/o guy and i’ve read it is good to have a same-sex therapist since they have probably gone through the same situations as you most part. But i started going about a year and a half with a woman who I had started to become really open with and I stopped going because of X reasons going on in my life atm. Today i’m ready to go back but idk if i should find a man to help me. This therapist already has a bit of background on me so I would rather go back with her because of that but i’m still not sure and I want to go back to therapy ASAP

657,What is wrong with me ??,"Hello, so first a little about me i guess. I'm 16 male, i'm from Australia. Lately, increasingly in the last 6 months to a year. I have been getting extremely lazy, it's getting to the point where it's affecting my life now. There are a few big things that it's affecting badly that i need to change NOW!!!

So the first and the biggest, I'm studying web design through what we call TAFE. i think it's like college for Americans. Anyway, i'm so lazy to the point where i don't do any of the work, i wake up in the morning when my alarm goes off, but i just go back to sleep. I say i'm too tired or i'll get it done the next day. I'm skipping classes too. See i live with my dad and he goes to work really early so there isn't any way for him to know i'm not going. Right now, as i type this out, i'm supposed to be in class. However i'm sitting at my desk in my bedroom in my pajamas typing this out on my computer. I was supposed to go yesterday too but instead i slept until  1 PM then played video games all afternoon. See the problem??

Second issue is my personal hygiene and the sorts, i might brush my teeth once a week. Not because i don't remember, i do, i think about doing it every night. I'm just so lazy i just go to sleep anyway without brushing them. Same with showering, sometimes i'll just skip showering because i can't be bothered to walk up the stairs to have a shower. Other times i wont even eat. I've gone entire days without eating because i simply can't be bothered to make something. I'd rather just sit there and play video games or watch YouTube. 

I have basically no life, i dropped out of school because i was too lazy and could never find the motivation to go and do it. So i just ended up failing all my subjects because i watched Netflix in class all the time. So i spend my days sleeping, playing video games and browsing the internet. I honestly think i might be addicted to the internet at this point, i always want to be on the internet and when i'm not using it i'm cranky and i am thinking about using it. Which i have read are signs of addiction. But i can't help myself. All i want to do with my life is lay in bed and play video games or browse social media. I'm honestly content with just doing that. But i can't just do that.

I'm really angry at myself because i let this control my life and the laziness is so strong all i ever want to do is use my computer. I put off so many important things and i'm putting my life on the line by doing it. I just need some help, but i don't know where to start."
658,No idea what im doing :/,"hey everyone, 

im honestly unsure what to do with my life right now 

recently turned 30 / 3 close friends passed away in a car accident / decided to quit my job because im not happy.

659,PTSD disgnose,"Usn veteran diagnosed C-PTSD with dissociation.Symptoms of schizophrenia, basically top the charts with schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, maybe ADHD. How do you get over this, nothing makes me happy ever, short term memory problems, constantly thinking people can hear my thoughts, constantly worrying, constantly thinking I am doing something when in reality I am not. Been to therapy for years and been on every pill just about. What can I do?"
660,Why the F is it so hard to get help?,"Back about 3 years ago I used to see someone for depression and ADHD. They fell out of my network, I felt fine without meds, and I stopped going.

Friends and family have told me that I've reached a new low. I'm blocking people out of my life, deleting numbers from my phone except critical work ones, and not responding to anyone. My cousin who's a psychiatrist keeps telling me that I need to get help now.

So I tried. I called 20 fucking places. 2 of them called back saying that they aren't accepting new patients. The other 18 didn't even have the fucking decency to call me back. What the fuck.

I can tell something is wrong with me. I was the polar opposite of what I am now in college. How the hell do I fix this before I hurt myself?"
661,Is there a way to make a dog understand that their friend is dead and won't come back?,I know this has to do with dogs but I was wondering if there is a way to help. So last June I had lost my dog and it destroyed me but it also destroyed my other dog who is really young. She has just been so sad and angry as she would attack my other dogs nowadays. I want there to be a way that I can maybe help her get over it.
662,Can I go to a psychiatrist without telling my parents?,"I am a 21 year old college student living in a dorm. I think I need to see a psychiatrist, I don't know if I have social anxiety disorder, depression or even ADHD. I have extreme difficulty forming sentences when talking to people and I am constantly forgetting things. Sometimes I have absolutely no motivation to do anything or to get out of bed. I also experience a lot of brain fog and have been feeling this way for a few years. I don't want to tell my parents I am going to a psychiatrist but I am on their insurance. If I get prescribed something, will it show up on the insurance?

There's a few reasons I don't want to tell my parents (they're alcoholics, I don't think they would understand, they could be contributing to the reason I may be depressed, etc). But if I have to tell them I will, I just wanted to get some advice first."
663,Told My Parents About My Anxiety and Asked to See A Therapist - Don't Feel Much Better,"Everyone around who I told that I have anxiety told me to tell my parents. ""Ask to a therapist. If they really do love and care about you, they'll let you,"" they said, ""You'll feel so much better."" Well I did, and I feel worse if anything.

My mom wasn't hard - she was very encouraging. It was my dad that scared me. Just last week he went on a rant on how everyone wanted a ""label"" to fit in or for attention. I was scared, so I waited.

When I told him, in front of my mother for support, the whole mood dropped. I got short and guarded answer. That or my anxiety made it seem like that. I'm just so scared and jumpy right now.

I'm posting to try and help but idk if it's working."
664,I feel like i’m drowning,"It feels like every traumatic, angry, frustrated and emotionally painful moment in my life has finally affected me these past weeks. I have always held myself to the standard of being a man, of not crying, brushing off these experiences. Nothing in particular, just all of these moments coming at once into my life and I feel like i’m drowning. School is kicking my ass, work is kicking my ass, my brain is especially kicking my ass. I believe I have ADHD and that adds to my frustration because when i attempt school work, it feels impossible, i can’t focus, same with many other activities, i can’t keep myself busy i cannot focus. My emotions are just coming over me as stress builds up and i just want to disappear with no responsibilities for months. I know that sounds like everyone’s dream but to me, it feels like it’s the only thing i can do. my grades are slipping, relationships, everything. I just feel like i’m drowning in bullshit and emotions and i don’t know what to do. please help. anyone, anything, please."
665,Well That Was Stupid,"How many milligrams of Bupropion is considered an OD? Asking for a friend.

Also, how bad does it have to be to go to the hospital? 

Asking for a friend again."
666,Lost my sense of humour and becoming more logical/serious all the time.[16M],I’ve recently noticed I’m becoming more serious about everything and have stopped laughing at what my friends usually laugh at such as dark memes and what not. I don’t know if this is a stage of puberty and showing maturity or if it’s because of my toxic home environment. Can anybody give me guidance please?
667,ADD/ADHD/Anxiety/OCD/PTSD disorder leads to dementia?,"Are any of you aware of studies linking these disorders to early onset dementia?

What say you?"
668,How would you describe feeling guilty?,"I'm a recently diagnosed sociopath.. I've had a lot of realizations of what I thought were real emotions actually being me reflecting or manipulating the situation through emotions based on what Ive seen and know will get the response I want (or hope to get anyway). 
That being said, despite whatever shit I've done, I realized what I thought was me feeling guilty was really me feeling badly about getting caught but I've never really felt ""guilty"" about my actual actions. 
So, can anyone try and describe or explain to me what it feels like? What's your thought process? How to react/handle it? Examples? 
Thanks in advance"
669,Please pray for me,"In 4 days, it will be my birthday, and it would mean a lot to me if my depression and mental health issues went away as it has been a daily struggle for me. I believe in the power of praying as well as God, and I'm hoping people's prayers can help me out 😢 I've done several things such as partake in hobbies, sleep, distract myself, etc and nothing seems to be helping out."
670,Venting off I guess,"I'm not one to disperse my feelings and let loose. But I'm tired of holding everything in, even though I dont trust anyone I know. I'd feel too embarrassed. I'm in a constant loop of fighting my... thoughts with the only thing holding me back is my brother. I've lost interest in everything, I find little enjoyment, I dont know who I am anymore. My extreme social anxiety doesnt help, either. I'm not proud of where I come from and I'm not confident about anything. Nobody even knows who I truly am except myself. Even then I don't know myself"
671,"Something good happened to me, it felt good in the moment but I’m not happy anymore.","I feel like I SHOULD be happy, but I’m not. I accomplished something, but I’m just not happy and I feel like people will expect me to be happy."
672,Just want to vent,"Lately I can’t stop thinking about that my apartment is bugged, walking around looking for the cameras and mics. My plan is to find them and then sue them. However I’m worried it won’t work, even if I do find them and present them as evidence, they’ll say something ridiculous like I put them there, or a higher up member will get everyone there to not trust me ahead of time. It is an an entire organization that has been collecting video and audio recording and tracking everything I do for probably years now. They would probably never let me get away with suing these people. They have an entire storyline or prophecy they want me to follow and get me to do something horrible as part of it, then convict me for it, but I’m not lying down and taking this or doing anything they want. They’re involved directly with the devil Choronzon I’m possessed with and use it to show off their mind reading technology all the time to taunt me or manipulate me. But another hub or mountain in me I can hear is Jesus and also wants to use this body to carry out a prophecy 11 years from now. My brain feels like a giant landscape with hills and mountains, and the very tall mountains are so high they reach into heaven and Jesus enters and becomes them, the way God becomes colored windows on big buildings in the city. There’s smaller hills like Luke and Matthew. I feel like I’m flowing through the individual points of the landscape, like a 3D geometry with different topographies. Called it hubs and bands, energy transferring data or information between all the vertices or points of the landscape, and it doesn’t stop at the borders of my brain, I figured out those borders only exist on one zoom level and if you go up or down they disappear. So thoughts are just flowing into everything and everyone around me. It gets very obvious. The organization takes advantage of this and uses the devil to channel it.

Past couple nights I’ve heard very loud sounds outside my window and I was sure it was them, and they were on the roof coming to break into my window. I was frozen with fear at first but I thought to myself I’m not dying tonight just because I was too afraid to do anything. I got a weapon and sat staring at the window prepared to make sure I got the first move and take them by surprise for a long time but they didn’t ever come in. I think they are messing with me. All doctors seem to be involved with it too, including my therapist. I don’t want to see anymore because I can’t trust her but it is a lot to deal with without talking to someone about it. I will be testing her at our next session and figuring out if she is a part of it. If she is I’m dropping her and just staying the hell away from “mental health” services. I know for a fact the doctors are involved with it already, so it’s most likely that she is too. I recognize this all looks exactly like paranoid delusion but I know for a fact this is going on, in fact they are using that whole thing as a “plot device”. Making me hear voices and hallucinate and act like a schizophrenic is exactly what the devil does. I didn’t even know that before, when I researched it I found out it does that. I don’t know entirely my goal posting here I just wanted to vent about my situation since I don’t have anyone to talk to about it and can’t trust my therapist. Thank you"
673,Do autistic or normal people have emotional sets and images they operate from?,"My wife asked me if I had a personality disorder last night, I guess because I talk to myself a lot and my behaviors and especially my emotions can change a lot. I also still sleep walk as an adult... I think I’m pretty stable, so I said “no, of course not”, but I’ve started thinking about how my sense of self operates and for me it works like this: I have different emotional sets that have accompanying vibes: soldier, junkie, detective, doctor.... many more, but they all have an emotional range of what I can feel for the day or time that I occupy them, like  as a soldier I can’t feel the same level of sadness as if I was occupying a different set like a doctor. There’s a scale of emotions that each have access too. It’s like archetypes I’m operating from, but I’m aware of it, sometimes I use these consciously to get a job done, but many times I just let it play out how it’ll play out, but I do know which I occupy by the accompanying images that go in my mind. Along with these archetypes I do have body dysmorphia( sometimes I feel really fat, or thin, tall or short, ugly or beautiful) and there can be distortions in my perception of self. I can do everything to anyone if I’m sufficiently motivated. I know a lot of people say they couldn’t kill or hurt a child or dig thru sewage. Which I’ve always considered social posturing and I’ve always thought anybody can do anything, they just pretend that they can’t to make others feel better about them. I’m pretty much able to turn empathy/morality/disgust on and off like a light switch. I know I’m not a psychopath, because I feel really deep empathy when I want to and that’s my natural state. I also don’t have a good pain sense anymore, somethings that should hurt a lot don’t,( cuts that need stitches, twisted ankles)  and somethings that shouldn’t hurt at all, freak me out and I’ll think I have a broken bone when I don’t, or a broken tooth..... Anyways, do most people operate like this? Am I just mildly autistic like I’ve always thought of myself?"
674,I’m a genuinely awful person and I can’t stop myself,"For as long as I can remember everything I do has been reduced into pure strategy in my head. I’m very clever. I’ve sorted out how a lot of this works. I get away with lying because I have realistic lies and reasonable excuses, and I’m cautious. I can call attention to myself in a way that doesn’t make me look like an attention whore. I pretend I do it on accident.

Worse still is that I get pleasure from making other people feel uncomfortable or like they messed up. It makes me feel like I have control, because I always feel like I’m messing up somehow and I don’t want to be alone.

I’m manipulative as hell. These traits are not okay but I don’t know what to do about them. I know that someday, I’m going to be the abuser in an abusive relationship. I hate myself. I am an awful person and I need help."
675,Im scared that I might end up dead,"Im once again back In this subreddit.
It is 5 In the morning and I woke up feeling depressed once again and I got this thought that I might end up like my bother who comitted suicide In the age of 22.
Im now 18. I find myself not being able to Talk about my problems to anyone, I don't want my Mother to get all worried thinking that not only did I have an episode with subtances but now Im also afraid of myself."

677,Idk what the f*ck I'm doing on here,"I doubt anyone will even read this, I've never done anything like this before so I guess this is just a rant. I'm a 28 year old male who works in a blue collar field and is struggling to get to the point where I feel financially stable (since I'll be happy THEN.... right?...) I have a young son (under 10) that I had in a one night stand. I'm active in his life i.e. I pay child support, pick him up every weekend that's mine, play with him, take him to see family etc. I struggle to make and maintain social relationships. (I make friends easily but I dont ever maintain contact) I have 1 or 2 real ""friends"" but I've just severed one of those friendships over something trivial as fuck.. 

I think about killing myself almost every single day. Just idle thoughts. I've only actually almost did it once. (When I thought I wouldn't get the job that I have now.. ((which pays my rent now and not much else)).) I find my thoughts drifting off when I'm not doing anything. To putting a gun in my mouth or hanging myself. 

The only reason I didnt kill myself before is because when I was about to do it, I saw my sons shirt folded over a chair where I was (stupid I know) and I thought of how it would have fucked him up. 

So I'm not at active risk (that moment was enough to pull it out of my mind as an actual option) but i just sit and think about it a lot.

I do risky shit that I cant reason with myself as to the justifications.. I impulsively do drugs when I shouldnt (drug tests at work, I'd be fired and no way to pay rent) I have sex with complete strangers that I'm not even remotely attracted to. I've lost interests in my hobbies and I dont socialize at all anymore, unless I'm fucked up drunk (which is becoming a worse and worse person to be around, so I just drink alone mostly... almost every night) 

Idk what the fuck this is about, I just feel like blurting shit out for people to read.. and I didnt think much about what I decided to write. It's too much to cohesively explain I guess idk.

TLDR: worthless rant about life from someone who occasionally feels trapped, alone and desperate at times."
678,Out of options.,"Recently, my depression got worse. I think about suicide basically every day. Mainly because I can't think of any other solution.
Uni is shit. I would like to be a web dev, but here in the UK most employers want a degree, so I can't quit it.
I can't go to another uni, as I don't have enough money to travel.
I can't even find a decent job, I applied to 200 roles. 8 answers. 8 rejections.
Most importantly family. It's just bad. Way to long of a story.

I know, there are people that have it worse. I'm here sitting with my stupidi first world problems, and this makes me feel even worse. I should be happy, even with these issues, but no. I can't.

I don't know what to do. Psychotherapist are expensive. Medications are expensive. I don't have any real friends, they all just appear when they need help with uni stuff.

I started writing goodbye messages..."

doing anything indoors is too loud and i don’t want my roommates to hear. 

i just want to get ride of this helpless and angry feeling but i dont know how. 
sorry if this is the wrong place to post i just made this throwaway to vent. i’m not sure what i’m even asking or saying."
681,Attracted to emotionally abusive people,"It recently occurred to me that I am possible attracted to emotionally abusive people. People who are shady, mean, incessantly sarcastic and rude. I see it in my friend group and in my past relationships. I had an emotional abusive sibling which could possibly be the cause of this. Probably trying to build a relationship with them that I didn't have with my sibling. I am thankful that I realised it but now I am having trouble fixing the issue. How do I stop being attracted to toxic people?"

Or at least tolerate it enough to allow some level of intimacy?,"I was diagnosed with PCOS, depression, and anxiety in the past 5 years. I’ve gained a lot of weight in my stomach and there’s a fatty pad on the back of my neck. All of that has made it impossible for me to feel sexy or desirable in anyway. I haven’t had sex in years, but really I haven’t been intimate in anyway either. I can’t seem to accept my body the way it is and allow myself to be intimate the way it looks/feels. Any experiences like this? Any advice?"

690,Who so you talk to when you can't talk to your only friend?,"I'm bipolar and have a sleep disorder. My only close friend in the world now is my wife. To make a long story short I feel like she was picking on me yesterday about my struggles.

You've got to understand I live on a razors edge regarding sleep. It's a sensitive, sensitive issue for me. So for my wife to start in on me about it really, really hurts. She didn't even have a reason, other than pettiness.

I got really upset and I feel like nobody understands me and I have no one to talk to. There are two older teenagers here and everyone looks at me like I'm an alien. I feel so fucking alone and isolated. On top of that I'm very discouraged. I feel like she stabbed me in the back.

Life is painful right now."
691,My brain is screwing with me,"I have depression and anxiety. (That's all that's been formally diagnosed) I have a wonderful girlfriend, who has some anger issues, but I try to work on those with her. I think I love her and I want to love her, but I'm emotionally numb almost all the time. It's been a couple years since it started, but I've felt my emotions all dull to a point where I've become comfortable with it, and become anxious when they present themselves in a more prominent way. If I ever feel any love, it's barely there. It's not just my girlfriend, but my family, and friends too. I dont know why I am this way, but I really hate it. 

I miss being able to feel like I never wanted to leave someone. I can never spend much time with anyone and not just want to be alone for a long time. 

I've found myself disassociating from reality a bit. It's not too common, but sometimes I feel like I dont belong in this body, with my girlfriend, in my family. I feel like this is someone else's life and I dont understand why I'm living it. 

I'm hoping I'm not alone in feeling like this. Surely im not. If anyone has any sort of advice, ideas, anything, I'm open to listening. Thank you."
692,Mental Health Advocacy Threads?,"I'm new to reddit and was looking for some Mental Health Advocacy threads because I am the president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness at my college campus. I was hoping to find other passionate individuals where we can discuss our advocacy, tips, and ideas. Does anyone know if something like this exists?

&amp;#x200B;

If not, does anyone have any ideas for a mental health related event that they would like to see or deem helpful? I'm always looking for new ideas for event my organization can put on, and would love to hear how others support, educate, and advocate for Mental Health."
693,Mental health and society thoughts,"I just feel like the whole ""mental health crisis"" has been so horribly manipulated in society (coming from america atleast). Alot of people are suffering because of bad economy, loneliness, and an unsteady future. All things caused by the way our society is fundamentally run, but as soon as people start talking about solutions to rising accounts of depression and the likes, it's all about new SSRI'S or too much screen time or whatever BS they can come up with. (Dont get me wrong medication does work for some people) 
Its literally because corporations dont want you to feel good just so that they can trick you into buying more for the illusion of happiness, and to keep you obedient in your minimum wage job. 
The best thing you can do is be part of a community, preferably in person I'd say, but even this is a community. One where you can talk freely and you help people and theres the exchange and working togetherness that has made people survive for hundreds of years. The thing is that we can make a change as a community but not as individuals, which I think applies to mental health aswell. 
If you have been told that you need to fix your mental health alone and it's only your work that can change it I think that's wrong. It's normal to have some level of dependence on other people, and to need things from them, even as an adult. You deserve to be loved and feel comfortable BEFORE you can start healing.

Yeah that's basically it. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. 

Also,side thought, I think it's so important to sit with your feelings and ask WHY you feel some way instead of just immediately trying to stop feeling it"
694,I have been having really horrible thoughts lately. Is there a kind of therapy that specifically assists with this?,"In addition to strong anxiety and mild depression, in recent years I have become a borderline racist, homophobe, and misogynist. Please don't judge me. Forces in my life have shaped me into this, and I really want to be better. 

However, when I search for types of therapy online, it doesn't seem like these are issues that therapists commonly deal with, so I really don't know where to start.  


With respect to the borderline misogyny, would it be bad for me to have a female therapist? It's not something I mind.

Any helpful advice is really appreciated."
695,I’m a failure.,It’s so hard to find love. It’s impossible to feel it. I try hard but nothing ever works out in my life. I’m to just sick of everything to talk anymore.
696,your opinion?,"hey y'all, so I wanted to hear your take on this. I'm constantly tired; I struggle to stay awake during the day and I feel like absolute hell if I don't have at least one nap during the day, although I can take up to three and even then I'll still feel tired. I can't sleep until 1 in the morning but if I don't set an alarm I'll wake up at 10 or so, however I do wake up multiple times throughout the night for no reason at all. i've had my iron levels tested and treated to no avail, i've had my thyroid checked and it's in perfect condition. i've tried exercising, eating healthy, getting sunlight, etc etc, but none of it did anything to help. I suppose I'm just not sure if this is mental health related or not, because doctors seem to think there's nothing ""medically"" wrong with me. I appreciate y'all taking the time to read this, and if you have any questions i'll try my best to answer them"
697,Residual fear from rejection and I’m having a hard time (LGBT),"I thought I was over it but apparently I’m not. I was in a relationship last year with someone who insisted that he was bisexual. After we’d been dating for a few months and we’d physically been intimate three times (which I did because I felt love, I don’t usually do hookups I’m too emotional) he told me my body was gross. My parts were gross and that I would always come “second” to men in terms of beauty and sex appeal. I broke up with him. I spent a lot of time working on myself and healing. I’m not upset with him being what is (I suspect) a gay man in denial. I just felt absolutely destroyed when he picked apart my body and compared me to three other males. I’m female. 

Then, recently I just started dating a new guy after talking for awhile. He is so much nicer and lovely. We are meshing really well. Flirty, fun. We confessed feelings and started dating He also identifies as bi. I’m fine with this. I am too . I just happen to keep running into people who are? I guess it’s my circles. But recently I’ve been increasingly anxious and tonight my anxiety is just peaking. I’ve noticed on his tumblr and stuff he never reboots women or m/f bi stuff. Just gay m/m. I’m getting paranoid this will be a repeat. 

We talked about intimacy before and he told me he’s inexperienced but insisted he was attracted to me. I told him about the last guy and what he did. I even have screenshots of my current bf telling me what he did was terrible. But I am so afraid I am not good enough or not the type of person he would want in that way. 

I feel this way because I creeped his blog tonight and he reblogged something about fucking a guy. I’ve sent him a few dirty/cheeky snaps over the past week (testing the waters) and he just called me cute. I... am very nervous and my anxiety is out of control. I am crying. I’m so scared. I just have some body issues and I just want to be desired. I don’t know how to bring it up because he keeps deflecting any mild flirtation that is sexual. Or being “polite”. I just want to know he wants me. we don’t have to do anything yet, I just want that affirmation I guess.

I’m realizing I’m traumatized from being picked apart. I remember my libido was so shot. But it’s back and I want to have that connection with my new bf. I feel like just putting this on the table will be weird. 

I need to calm down. Ugh."
698,Nausea/Nervousness around Girlfriend,"Hey, this is my first post on here and this is one thing I’ve been struggling with for some time now. I have been dating my girlfriend for 3 months and despite the short amount of time of us being together I’ve fallen madly in love with her and her everything. Only recently when I went over to her house one day about 3-4 weeks ago have I gotten really nauseas around her. I went to her upstairs bathroom because I thought I was gonna throw up and I was over the trash can almost dry heaving, my mouth was producing so much saliva I was spitting it into the toilet. Since then it has gotten worse and has started happening when I’m around her and it‘s so bad that I get nauseas right away. It’s like I get this super nervous sinking feeling in my stomach and that’s all I can think about and I can’t get it out of my head. This past time that we hungout (Valentine’s Day) I was super nervous and actually threw up. Even though I know I’m okay, it’s like I have this mental block and today even over FaceTime I got nauseas too. I don’t understand and I want it to go away because I just want to relax and be able to have a good time with her like how I used to in the first two months of our relationship. If anyone could please help me figure this out, or give me some advice that’d be great. I’ve tried yoga breathing, and telling myself I’m okay, and pretending that everytime I breath out it’s black smoke which is like the bad energy in my bod"
699,When is it considered that you've gone INSANE or at the point of no return,"I have been actually weird for the longest time very strange mood swings, weird way of speaking and I've been diagnosed with alot of things or have been suspected of having recently, weird way of speaking or like a bit less of control of my body like I'll start swinging my arms around randomly and hit myself randomly (I knwonits cause of my ADHD and other things but still) I just feel like I've been going insane and I feel like me questioning myself if I'm going Insane has been making everything worse na stuff.

My thought process is very messed up at the moment and I'm rationalizing that 1 cut on the part of my arm under the bandage won't hurt anything. Can anyone help me stop?

702,Babies and PPD,"Hey yo. I’m (27f) recently diagnosed with anxiety, depression and PTSD. I’ve felt shitty for a long time but actually facing the music is making it all seem so much worse. Here’s a concern that’s been weighing on me lately; I’ve always wanted kids, ALWAYS. But now I’m so worried about prenatal and postpartum depression. Everything is so grey lately and I’m drowning in apathy and it’s so hard finding the will to just exist. My husband (27m) is really great and so supportive so that’s a plus, but it still scares me. Anyone have any experience here?"
703,"Anxiety, guilt, and self-sabotaging behavior when things are going right","I'm a final year college student, and for the first time in my life, things look promising. Plucked up the courage to speak to a few professors, and now I have the opportunity to do research with them. I have been through many ups and downs to get here, even reached a point where I wondered whether I'd get a college degree, and so for the first time in my life, I actually felt a mild sense of achievement and pride. However, now that it has sunk in, I'm feeling extremely scared -- I feel like everything is going to fall apart soon enough. I keep thinking that all of this is a HUGE mistake and people are going to realize that I don't deserve this (also feel really guilty to ""stealing"" someone else's opportunity). I wake up in cold sweats, experience stomach churning anxiety when things go slightly wrong, and find myself sobbing and wailing inconsolably because I think all this is going to end badly and I won't be able to graduate.  I should be studying right now now but I'm feeling so anxious that I need to distract myself. I finally have the opportunity to prove myself but I'm not able to do it because every time I try to sit and study, I begin to ruminate and catastrophize about how things will go wrong. I'm going to mess this up too! I really need help, I don't know what's happening! I've been seeing a counselor at my college but they never suggested that I go seek a psychiatrist or seek an official diagnosis. However, this is really taking a toll on me, and  I don't want to ruin it! Should I go beyond a college counselor at this point?"
704,The night I was born,"Silence greeted me. Not of the sort that draws one in and embraces in its bosom or lulls one into intoxicating lethargy; neither that, that follows the rush of air and curt whine of hinges fastened to a door swiftly shut on the trials of an arduous day. I was greeted with the song of malice. A numbing silence bred of disgust, malcontent, and icy disdain. The sort of vacuous void that trots on the heels of an eruption of venom.

I stood stunned, paralyzed by the absence of cohesion in my mind. My thoughts had been dashed; cast into the abyss as if they were struck by a thunderous gale. I blinked. I shuffled my vision and focused on the front door, the hammerblow of its closure still reverberating in my skull. 

""Wothless"", ""fucking piece of shit"", ""deadbeat"", ""you're the fucking reason why"". 

I didn't feel anything for what seemed like hours. I stood peering into the door. Perhaps through it. Maybe in an attempt to reconstruct the events that just collided and left me reeling in the dusty aftermath of discord that followed.

A blur of motion swam before my eyes as I staggered to a nearby chair. The peeling tick of my bare feet on the linoleum floor echoed and coalesced as I slumped. 

And then I made my descent. The world around me made its evacuation, fleeing from the darkness enveloping me. The light emitting from the dank apartment rose, it wavered, and then it was gone. A candle caught in a gust.

My throat closed and I could feel the wounds in my chest for the first time. Thin lacerations, each no more wide than the breadth of a hair descended in a wave through my torso. Each one intersecting in a lattice through my heart. The last of the light poured forth.

I jerked as if strung on a marionette. Through the void I could hear the distant pattering of my own feet on the linoleum floor. I felt the bite of cold steel saturate my hands. 

I felt a wall thud against me from behind and the strings gave slack. I crashed to the floor and the lines went taught at my arms. The kiss of cool metal met my lips and the taste of iron flooded my senses.

My thoughts came racing back to the fore as if beckoned forth by the icy touch. The strings tightened and the darkness smothered me as if sensing the challenge to their rule. 

I heard laughter then. Not of malice, or of madness. But the sweet song of innocent joy. The giggle of a child's glee. 

The strings gave free, receding back to the void. The silence replaced by the calming melody of my steady heart. The light returned, blurred through tears. 

I peeled my eyes open and blinked to clear my vision. 

I was alone. Sitting against the wall. My sons clumsily discarded shirt dangling from the corner of a chair before my eyes. The pistol from the drawer came to rest on the floor beside me."
705,My boyfriend is suicidal. Where can I get him the help he needs?,"My boyfriend and I live on almost opposites of the U.S. lately he’s been having major breakdowns and suicidal thoughts. 

He’s always struggled w depression due to childhood trauma (dad was physically abusive and mother died of alcoholism) but in recent years it has gotten much worse- esp over the last few months. He keeps telling me he wants to end his life and I’m afraid if I don’t take action I’m gonna lose him... 

He has two best friends that have spoke of getting him professional help including being admitted but I feel they don’t understand the full situation. I’m gonna speak w them tomo and explain the situation.

 I’m very new to all of this and I NEED to get my boyfriend help. How can I do this? Should he be admitted to a hospital? Seek a psychiatrist? I don’t know the proper care to give him but it needs to happen fast. He doesn’t have insurance at the moment but I’m willing to cover whatever he needs. 

TLDR; my boyfriend is in an EXTREMELY unhealthy state of mind and is on the verge of suicide. We live thousands of miles away but thankfully he has two close friends near by. I’m calling them tomo to explain the situation. My question is where do they bring him and what help can they get for him?"
706,Need help. Now!,"I just realized that I have been repressing memories. The most recent was my cousin’s death in November. I just realized it today.i. Understand it’s from years os severe physical and emotional abuse. I’m worried about what else ,Ishtar be down there. Any advice?"
707,Feeling unheard at times,"No matter what I say or when I express myself, some just don’t wanna hear it or take offense to it. It really irks me that I can’t express my feelings without feeling like shit! Reaching my breaking point! 😡"
708,What would this be classified as in the world of psychiatry?,"To keep things short, I basically indulge in a lot of self-harm-like behaviours for emotional gratification. It can't be called self harm, however, because it's not the direct injury one's body. It's more than that. And it's not with the intent to cause suffering, because like I stated, I do it for the emotional pleasure it gives me. Behaviours such as starvation, sleep deprivation and other forms of dysfunctional living gives me a great deal of pleasure.

I'm wondering if this kind of thing has a clinical term that I could use to familiarise myself with it. My therapist brought up non-sexual masochism, but from my understanding, masochism is also about the enjoyment of one's own helplessness, whilst I feel very powerful when I engage in such behaviours.

Clearly this kind of reaction to dysfunction isn't mentally sound, but from what I can tell there really isn't much information about it, or really a way to understand it. 

Any thoughts?"
709,Feeling Alone,"im currently in high school (senior), and just halfway through this year my friends just started leaving me and not giving a shit that they left me. i started off the year well, but people just started ditching me for better options and now im all on my own. i dont have any close friends, ive deleted my social media, and i feel like i just dont deserve happiness anymore. maybe its me? i dont know
everything just keeps going wrong and getting worse and i know everyone keeps telling me college will be better but i cant manage a day without feeling utterly depressed. i have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and this experience has done nothing but make those feelings worse by tenfold. i have a therapist, but she doesnt help other than just saying to ignore my issues, and i dont know how much longer i can put up with it. every time i do anything im bombarded with the reminder that i have no friends and that im useless at everything. 
honestly the only reason i still want to live is for my family, but i just feel like giving up on trying in life (like school, etc) ive lost motivation for so much that i just feel like a failure and i dont know how to stop it. everyone says i have to be more confident in myself and stuff like that, but i just cant have a single good thought about myself and i just thrive off validation from other people. i just dont know how to combat these emotions without working to reframe my whole way of thinking.

does anyone have tips on getting through school with no friends and with no motivation to do anything anymore?"
710,Emotionless on anti-depressants?,"So I have BPD, depression and General Anxiety Disorder. Currently on anti depressants, and anxiety medication.

Any help appreciated!"
711,Am I crazy? or do I just think I'm crazy?,"Weird question.... Sometimes I feel crazy. I feel like my whole life there's been something off about me and nobody will tell me. 

My life is 100% normal - great job, I perform extremely well, make great money, have normal &amp; good friends, get along with literally everyone. Great family life etc... I see a therapist weekly due to job stress, life stress, past trauma, and just wanting to generally be the best person I can be and maintain a quality life. I am very sensitive, especially at work and thrive on acceptance from others (which i naturally do not constantly get, but it does affect my mood when I'm not), and I get very irritated with people that I don't mesh super well with - yet I hide my emotions insanely well and nobody would ever know. I've been told many times by bosses when I lose it and quit a job that they had no idea how irritated I was. However I always way over think it and try to make a rational decision, and only ever leave when I have something better lined up. (Currently going through exactly this).

I recently quit drinking (also part of therapy), so I've just been thinking a lot. I assume my therapist would tell me if something were standing out as off about me, right? 

I had a crazy nightmare last night that I was screaming at my family because they were having an intervention with me tell me there's something wrong with me they've always known about and I couldn't get it across to them that I'm fine. Anyways, sometimes I just feel like I'm in a cloud of messy-brain-ness that I can't get out of. Maybe that's part of removing alcohol from my life too, I've heard that happens..

Would love opinons, and I'll likely share all of this with my therapist next week anyways. Thank you!"
712,Reoccurring sadness and jealousy of other,"Ever since I turned 18 I have had reoccurring feelings of sadness.  It’s mostly due to my lack of friends who I hang out with outside of obligations like school and work.  Right now I am at a time where I am not in college, because my mom stopped me from going due to my first semester grade.  I’ll be going soon, but now I’m going crazy because I spend everyday at home.  I am not allowed to see some friend from college and it’s a little vexing.  I am also losing interest in things that were fun like videogames.  I seem to get jealous when my one friend brings up thing I can’t do and probably can’t do in the future in college.  Right now when I return she will keeping a close eye on me while I commute to college.  I am also jealous when watching streamers on YouTube having better lives than me.  Which sort of made me want to switch my major to enjoy life,and not struggle with computer science.  Right now I just want really close friends to lean on and tell them things I can’t tell other people and especially my family.  With my mom being a hardcore Christian it’s just hard to get through to her and to stop treating me like a child."
713,I'm been told things most cannot comprehend let alone understand,"I know things most cannot fathom yet I am still Able to get what I wanted to do when I was 1st born into my realm.

714,I Might Be A Sociopath...,"So.... I don't really know where to begin. I think most of this is gunna rely on a Q&amp;A in the comments to figure this out. 

Hey, I'm a 22yo male living in Ontario Canada, and I think I may be a sociopath or something similar.

I don't believe I'm a full blow 'throw people under the bus for my personal gain' sociopath because I do care about people genuinely and I feel a lot of emotion. I have noticed though that I match a lot of the traits and my life has been pretty damaged because of it. 

So, luckily for me I think I have a pretty good moral compass thankfully as these behaviors I'm experiencing would be SO much worse if not. I'm going to do my best to list as much as I can off the top of my head, behaviors I think are signs of it but then also add a personal counter to it.

1. I am very easy to irritate and after that, very easy to anger. But im selective with this, for instance, Video Games, super easy to set me off. At home arguments, also easy, but with strangers or friends? I'm calm and collected, and I'm never prone to violence, even if im thinking about it, i never react that way.
2. I will purposely neglect tasks in order to shove them off onto someone else. But I feel bad doing it a lot of the time an know its wrong but 99% of the time I still follow through and even when im called out on it, I don't change (GF telling me off for neglecting chores for instance)
3. I feel a lack of empathy/sympathy most of the time. I do experience it genuinely but not often, but in cases such as a friend has a breakup, I don't feel that bad for them but I will comfort them and offer advice to the point where it looks like im being sympathetic but I often feel as if I'm doing it to make my friends like me more rather than actually caring about how they feel, even though I actually do care. (IK its confusing and hard to explain, Its like I care but I don't at the same time...)
4. I'm extremely impulsive, especially with money. I spent my $9k school grant in 2 months. 'Nuff said there, cant even back this one up, I'm just really bad with my money and I don't realize how far I've gone till I'm broke again. 
5. I ignore my GF unintentionally, I know I have to give her love and affection and attention but instead I sit on my ass playing games and I often totally forget to spend time with her or acknowledge her, even when she directly asks for attention, I'll promise her attention but then it slips my mind and I keep playing games. I know she needs it and I truly want to make her happy but my mind just throws the idea out the window and totally forgets, same with doing things that would make her life better. I want to do it, I just genuinely forget and I feel bad.
6. Continuation of the last one. When my GF does get mad or frustrated with me, or anyone in general (usually due to me forgetting to do something for them) I tune them out and don't respond, I'm listening to them but I'm not there, y'know? I hear the words but they don't mean anything to me. Its almost like, ""Welp they are mad now so there's nothing I can do now, so just shut down and wait for them to finish"" and I think that's partially why I don't learn from my mistakes. 
7. The only time I start to listen is when there is a life changing risk on the line, say for instance my GF has had it and threatens to leave me, then ill start actually actively caring and will do well just to bring it back from the brink of break-up but once the dust settles I'm back to my shitty antics. Same goes with the workplace, but they are typically less forgiving, thus I've been fired from quite a few places, usually due to arriving late numerous times.
8. Small point, but I think it counts. I drive pretty recklessly, I'm almost always speeding not by much but I'm often 10-20km above the limit. I don't swerve around or bob through traffic, but I just little care, I text and drive a lot also. But then I also criticize other drivers for being bad drivers and driving recklessly.
9. When called out on mistakes by someone who doesn't know me well such as supervisors or acquaintances, or if there is room to lie to soften the blow or get out of trouble, I will often lie. But will not usually lie if it means it will harm someone else, like I will own up to a mistake rather than show the punishment onto someone else (but maybe cause that would increase the chances of getting caught in the lie, but also cause I don't like throwing people under the bus). Even on small things, I don't wanna take the heat so i'll lie, knowing that if I get away with it i'll be off the hook but if I get caught lying the consequences will be 10x worse.
10. As mentioned earlier, I'm irresponsible, I've been fired from a few jobs for being late constantly, and I constantly neglect household chores and responsibilities, even if I'm aware of the consequences of neglecting them, and in the case of the chores, sometimes I just straight up forget about them, but constantly. 
11. I'm very selfish and I often don't realize till I'm called out on it, just in general. Trivial stuff like getting someone a drink when i go to the store to get one or lending money to a friend is not an issue, I don't mind doing that stuff. It's more-so the total absence of mind in some situations causing me to totally forget to do things for people like mentioned earlier. For instance, a while back my GF had a really hard day at work and when she came home and complained about it, I still expected her to make dinner. Like WHAT? what was I thinking? After I realized that was a really stupid thing to do, but her being the best, actually did make food, although being very pissed off at me for good reason. 

So that's about all I can think of right now but I assure you there is more. The one thing turning me away from believing I'm a sociopath is that all the sources I've seen talk about how they don't show remorse and don't really actually care about anyone other than themselves but that's not true for me. I love, and care for many people around me, I'm just unfortunately pron to neglecting them sometimes, but I also have the opposite for some people sometimes where I cling to them and wanna be around them all the time. I genuinely love my GF and my friends and care about their well-being also. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for posting this here, Confirmation? Knowledge? I know I wanna bring this up to my counselor and doctor but I also don't wanna walk in and open up the sociopath can just to find out im just an idiot and have something else or embarrass myself someway. I think its good that I'm self-aware that I have an issue though, no matter what it is, at least im not blissfully ignorant, thinking everything is fine while everyone around me suffers. 

Most importantly I need to know how to be normal, I want to be a good BF for my GF and lately I've not been, she is pissed at me and I need to take the initiative and stop acting so selfish but I don't know how, whatever is making me act the way I do is hardwired into me and idk how to stop it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Thanks for reading. If you have any questions feel free to ask away, and of course any help is much appreciated. Just plz don't lecture me, I want to learn, not be told off."
715,I'm scared.,"I feel like everything I do just isn't good enough but 
I have a wife who loves me and I love her but at night I'm scared I won't wake up too see your face again and I feel like sh*t every single goddamn day and nothing helps. 
 Had to get this off my chest my apologies."
716,Follow Up,"Hi everyone!

So not to overshare, but yesterday I took 2,400 mgs of Bupropion. Needless to say, it was a pretty damn rough night.

My concern is this: I'm still having really bad tinnitus and I'm terrified It'll always be like this. My other OD's were not like this. 

Am I doomed?"
717,Extreme nostalgia,"Hey everyone.

For the past 2 years, i’ve started getting some extreme nostalgia. It can be debilitating, and really wrecks me emotionally.

I was known as a really happy, energetic kid when I was young, and I was truly happy. But now, as a 19 year old teenager, I feel sucked. Life lost all the magic it once had. It’s dry. The best I can do is make everything feel okay on certain days. Nothing is sparked, and I feel I have completely changed as a person. 

I will get extremely vivid flashbacks to myself when I was 4 or 6, completely random memories. Sleeping at grandmas house, 8th birthday, old play dates, and they ruin me. I break down when I’m alone often. I know other people speak of nostalgia, but I have found no one can relate to what I experience. 

What can I do?"
718,Feel like I'm not doing enough,"I'm going to start by saying I am not diagnosed but due to my constant physical symptoms (racing heart, always out of breath, constant sweating, headache, etc) and terrible insecure and intrusive thoughts that it's pretty clear I have some type of anxiety. I did therapy for a while (triggered by another, more serious reason) and spoke about my anxiety which helped for a little bit. However, our insurance only covered a certain amount of sessions and after that, we would have to pay for it ourselves so I stopped going. Therapy helped a little but my fears always came back, so I started thinking of other ways to help myself because I'm not exactly willing to spill all my fears and insecurities onto my parents. The only thing that helps temporarily and is quick and reliable is that breathing technique all over the internet.

To start with, I'm a very rational person but my fears are so great that it controls my decisions and most of the time prevents me from talking, even to my parents or close friends. This is just a long-winded way of saying I don't actually know how to help myself. I thought about suggesting meds but that would require me not only confronting my parents about it (who don't like taking meds if they don't have to and think that meds for MI change you and it's better without) but also getting diagnosed and I'm not sure they want to believe I may have an actual MI and not just some social anxiety. I also have too much insecurity about my own conclusions, so I can't just say it, you know?

That being said, I would appreciate any suggestions on how to deal with anxiety."
719,Mental Breakdown,I’ve been feeling so manic these past few weeks. I just chopped all my hair off. It’s 1 am and there’s school in the morning but I haven’t slept in a few days. My heart is racing. I don’t know what to do. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow. I don’t know what my mom will say about my hair. I wanna scream. I wanna run. I have so many assignments due this week but I haven’t gotten anything done. I can’t sit still. I’m sorry.
720,Disordered Thoughts.,"I’ve always strugged maintaining a healthy relationship with food. I was diagnosed with a disorder seventh grade. Even after months of steady recovery, the thoughts never really go away.

I was doing good for a good amount of time. I stopped counting, started eating well, and began accepting my true self. I was content with myself for the majority of 2019.

However, I’ve found myself slipping back into old habits. I’ve started to feel much more self conscious about what I eat and how I appear to others. I’ve been feeling very sidetracked lately. I logged into my calorie tracking app for the first time in months yesterday. Definitely not something I’m proud of.


Despite the excessive mindfulness of meal times, I don’t believe this slip up is revolving around weight. I don’t have a need to lose any more pounds or look any differently. I’m fairly certain this time is centered around a sudden desire for control. Things have been spiraling recently and keeping track of what I eat has kept my mind occupied. It’s distracted me from the trauma I’m too afraid to work through.

I need some advice on keeping myself in track and finding better/healthier methods to gain control."

726,Darkness,"First time posting on Reddit nevermind venting, but my soul just needed to scream.  I think I'm ok for now, not feeling suicidal, just very very lost.


The loneliness is slowly eating a hole deep down inside me, and everything I try to cover the hole up with just gets consumed and dragged in. It grows stronger and hungrier and darker with each passing day.

 I know that love is the only thing that will ever have a chance of stopping it, but I grow ever more fearful that it's already become too late.  The darkness has grown so strong and consumed so much already that what do I even have left to give? 

Who could love someone so broken? 
Am I even capable of true love anymore?  
But at the same time I can't fight it by myself much longer.  

I'm scared.. 
And trapped.. 
And alone..  

Maybe the darkness will love me.."
727,I’m scared to live but I’m scared to die,"There is talk of suicide and self harm. I just thought I’d give a warning just in case.


I often think about suicide, and how many different ways I could do it but I don’t ever see myself actually going through with it. When I go through really bad days, or even when I get angry (my mental illnesses seem to make me a very irritable and angry person) I’ll say in my head “I’m going to kill myself” I’ve only ever gotten “close” to doing so twice. The first time I picked up a bottle of pills, and paced back and forth for awhile before I set them back down. The other time was in a parking ramp (really high up) and I rested my arms against the railing and thought to myself how I could easily jump it and end it. I’ve self harmed in the past and the urges do come back every now and then. However, when I did SH it was never an attempt to kill myself. I never cut deep enough. I guess my question (?) is... am I suicidal? Should I tell somebody Im Suicidal?"
728,Nonstop anger and hatred,"I know it’s a really broad title but overall I just can’t stand being around most people. Some people I automatically look at and hate them. I’ve been treated like trash by so many people so maybe that’s why I’m cynical and automatically assume someone I lay eyes on is a scumbag. The other night at subway this couple kept yapping on and on about some issue they were having with their friend and it was extremely irritating since all I wanted was peace and quiet. I didn’t confront or attack the guy even though I wanted to but when I was done with my food and drink as I threw them in the trash bin I noticeably threw it down hard and as I left the subway I said “Jesus fucking Christ this is BS!!” fairly loud before I left. 

Prior to this happening I had a couple of bad nights out. One night it was mostly positive because I danced with a lot of women and got a couple of their snapchats. But then a couple of situations almost set me off. First this one guy who I gave a ride to had this girl with him I gave a ride to also, she ended up saying something rude af behind my back that I’m glad he told me about. She said I’m “a bad dancer” and I’m like wtf I’m not a country bumpkin I’ve never even 2 stepped before how are you gonna diss me for not being an expert. Hell even most of the women I danced with hardly danced 2 step and they didn’t give a fuck that I didn’t know how to at first. When he had told me she said that I was like well I’m not giving her a ride back, tell her she can find another ride because that’s some rude and disrespectful bs. Oh and even another one of his female friends called me “short” lmao like that’s dumb af. I’m 5’10, you gotta be retarded or some bs to not know the difference between average height and “short”. I danced with mostly tall women though and they didn’t care about me being the same height and slightly shorter than some of them. He tried to convince me not to get mad at that woman and give her a ride back anyway and kept putting his hand on my shoulder. I grabbed his wrist and squeezed it kinda hard and he got the message then and shut his mouth. 

Then a couple nights later I go out again but to a different club scene. Was out with different friends and had fun being around them overall but I had no success with any of the women I approached. I thought I had success with one but after I got her Snapchat she left me on read and never added me back, so I might just block her so it’s over with. Oh and then the other 2 snapchats I got they never added me back either... So overall I basically had literally no success both nights out. Being dissed by 2 different women really pissed me off since I didn’t do shit to deserve it. 

I know this is like a short essay I just typed but I’m trying to give as much details as possible"
729,I don't know who I really am,"I used to think that I'm a hardcore loner, that I'm quiet and reserved. Though I always wanted to be bubbly and friendly, but that was only in my daydreams. I'm real life I wasn't anything like that. Now that I'm on medication I'm very talkative and I feel like I don't want to be on my own. When I was at work I couldn't wait till somebody else will come so I have someone next to me. I want to talk and have fun with other people. 

Now I don't know if I'm very introverted and quiet person that is just on drugs or if I was quiet and introverted because of my illness and this is really who I am. 

It makes me feel weird sometimes especially when I really don't have anyone to reach out and I'm still not confident enough to just go to a club or something to make friends. But I like being more open and feeling free when I talk with people and I'm more energetic in general. But I feel like I need to get way more insight in who I am and who I want to be. And changing all of this doesn't seem easy."

733,Anxiety and work.,"My anxiety has crippling control over me, it always has, and dare i say it always will. I’ve always had social anxiety, and it’s gotten better at times, but it’s so embedded in to me now that no matter what i do, it never truly goes. I spent a lot of time stoned in my teenage years, trying to bury the pain away. But now, more than ever, it’s taking its toll on my life. I really started to change for the better, i figured i’d get out of my dead end job and try my hand at something new, so after applying for numerous apprenticeships for weeks I finally landed one as a heavy vehicle mechanic. Now i’m not stereotyping or whatever but i feel most people here are very judgmental of my nature, my anxiety causes me to speak very little to people i’m not close too, and my workplace perceived me as uninterested because of this. I’m really keen to work, and get stuck in, but everyday i just walk around with nothing to do because everyone has every excuse to not let me work with them. i’m afraid of being fired, and i know the general opinion of me is very negative. I just wish i could socialise like a normal person, and progress with my life. i’ve been at the point of giving up for a very long time, every day is a crippling hell for me mentally at this place. i’m close to giving up, throwing in the towel and just living on mental health benefits for the rest of my life. I can’t take another day of negative judgement and hearing people gossip about me. I feel this mentality will just follow me over to a new job if i managed to get one.

every day for me is terrifying. everything in my life is being affected. i don’t feel i can talk to my boss about it and i’m scared for the future.

please. somebody help me."
734,Every day seems like a chore.,"Just getting up is the hardest of tasks. Being alive is not enjoyable and I really don't know how to get through it.

735,Coping with grief,"Hey guys,

So I consider myself overall a healthy person. I do well with my studies and work, I sleep well and exercise and I have healthy relationships.

Within the last 5 months, 5 people in my life have died, all 1 month between each other. 1 of them was a family member who died of illness, and the other 4 are friends who committed suicide. These friends did not know each other as far as I know.

I am really struggling to cope with the death's of my friends, as they came so unexpectedly and so close to each other. Before I have time to grieve for one friend, another one dies. And hearing how they did it has sent me on a downward spiral. 

I don't really feel like myself at the moment. I'm not looking forward to next month for fear of another death. I feel immense guilt for not checking up on them more often. This doesn't feel normal, almost like a curse. 

I have many responsibilities in my life and I just don't have energy for anything at the moment. But I've been pushing through. I am weighed down by grief every morning and night. When will this feeling go away?

I am seeing a psychologist at my university soon, but until then I'd appreciate hearing how you have coped with the death of a loved one or grief.  What should I do so that no one else flies under the radar? Thanks a lot."
736,Sharing My Story of a Crazy Life,"**Background:**

To begin, there are many ways I am very fortunate. My family is reasonably wealthy. My relative family is middle class, but both my grandparents are rich. One grandfather is a retired doctor, and the other a retired CEO. I also am lucky to be a resident of Hawaii. My grandparents support us by loans, and occasionally direct payments.

I moved so much as a child. My family has lived in 15 homes so far since I was born. I am 21. So I've lived at each home for only about 1 1/2 years.

I was born a vegetarian. My father is vegan, and the rest of my family and I are mostly vegan. By intermediate school this was devastating. I attended a middle school mostly populated by Marine brats. Military and vegetarianism are extremely contrasting forces. Seventh grade was a happy year of my life. But eighth grade I was tormented for being vegetarian.

My beliefs about vegetarianism caused me to think I had a hormonal imbalance. Specifically, I was worried my high consumption of soy products worried me. Soy products were my family's main source of protein, and soy products are also high in phytoestrogen (female hormones). This made me believe that my moods and thoughts were the same that women would experience. It also made me hypersensitive about my body image.

I wanted to be an omnivore at the start of high school. Buy my parents forbade it. So I started being an omnivore between my Junior and Senior years.

I used to be highly social as a child. I also was very addicted to video games from early Elementary School to one year ago. But I started to not have any friends or acquaintances by the Sophomore year of high school. My only friends were my online cohort: an even mix of previous real life and internet friends.

I was always a very good student. I tested at the college level reading during Elementary and Middle school, I scored at the top one percent of SAT testers, and my GPA was nearly a 4.0 before I was concussed before my Senior year.

I am yet to be part of a romantic relationship. The closest I got to being part of one was a relationship lasting a week with a girl at a Summer music camp.

I think it is possible I am autistic. My friends often call me that, and I excel greatly at Math and Music. I've never been formally diagnosed with autism.

My brother is Schizoaffective (a vaguer version of Schizophrenia). My mother has dealt with Psychotic Depression before.

**TLDR:** My brother's crazy and I though my hormonal balance was off until about a few years ago. Now I know I'm straight. I'm probably autistic too. My family can't stay at one house. We've also suffered from low income previously.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I want to talk about:**

I can't stand society or life. It's so stupid. I want to kill myself almost daily. I try to be Christian but my family contrasts too much so I basically need to choose one or the other: living with my family or being Christian.

The worlds surely going to end so why even try? AI or Global Warming are certainly going to kill us within the near future.

What the heck are humans thinking continuing to live the way we are living!? We should be downgrading. A return to archaic farm life and the destruction of factories, cars and planes are a must if we want to survive!

I can't have children, live a normal life, or have a family because I can't put another human through the misery I've experienced! I believe this is the root cause of my mental illness!

I spent 3 months this past year paid full time to live at a military psych ward! Because I couldn't stand retarded and terrible humans at boot camp! I am psychotic and hear voices occasionally!

I am Christian at heart and not a bad person! The closest person to a friend I met recently was a bipolar guy at the Military psych ward.

I can't stand this reality we are all living! we are living through screens instead of reality!

I can't stand Hawaii because it's too diverse. At some level humans are animals, and animals often choose to live by groups of their own color. Hawaii's WAY too diverse. It is the most diverse state by far. I lived for half a year in Massachusetts. At first it was horrifyingly non diverse and I hated it for that! But by the end of the year I could not imagine moving. I loved MA. Yet I needed to move anyway!

Yesterday I nearly hung myself! I set up a noose with a belt around my ceiling fan and wrapped it around my neck! I can't wait to die! All I used to live for was videogames, and orchestra music occasionally. I haven't played or watched videogames for over a year now! And I don't like orchestra music much!

I am insanely overwhelmed at what adult life is like! I don't have a driver's license and I can't earn one because my parents think I'm too crazy to drive!

So I need to walk about 5 miles with 50 pound groceries once a week!

I don't understand how other people can just live normal lives!

I agree with a quote from the crazy prisoner Golic from Alien 3: ""In an insane world, a sane man must appear insane.""

My dad bullies me almost daily. He is the worse human on the planet. He once fought with a group of pot dealers because he and a friend tried to steal pot from them. He smoked pot throughout high school. He abuses me and the rest of the family. He doesn't make that much money either. He's not religious.

**TLDR:** I am probably insane. Suicidal idealization is something I experience daily. My dad abuses me. Everyone abuses me. I can't stand life."
737,"""You were always enough, but if you learn to see yourself through a lens that is warped by the projections of wounded souls, then you may arrive at a less fulfilling conclusion.""","**Explanation**: Self worth issues are quite common, and are mostly caused by personalising the insults and attacks from others, and falsely believing that they are objective truths about ourselves, whereas they are really the projections from those who have been hurt and wounded themselves. Beneath their suffering is really a cry for help.

738,How do I stop waking up screaming?,"I'm in a really terrifying financial situation and I thought I was managing it well. I recently found a job that would pull me out of it and I got to the second interview and was so visibly nervous I just lost my mind.

740,My problem with self esteem is so bad it's ruining my life,"If I open snapchat or something and it's the front camera it makes me filled with hate for the rest of the day. I close my eyes around every mirror in my house, but it's still hard to not catch my reflection sometimes.

I never leave the house in fear that someone I know will see me. I only take online college classes, which is also to save on gas money, but this plays a big factor as well.

About half a year ago I got a compliment and I was able to look at myself for about a month, a couple times not even minding it. That's the only thing I've found has helped me so far.

I have trouble showering too. I know it's gross but I only do it once a week or once a couple weeks, not like I go out anyway. There's a built in mirror in my bathroom and it's impossible not to see myself when showering.

As stated in my last post, I also have a problem with hitting myself and seeing myself can often result in me punching myself.

Any advice would be really appreciated"
741,Mental health professional doesn't care,"I've had two fairly recent crises, after the first one I was placed under the care of the professional in question. I had another crisis, I told the crisis team I didn't want to go back to this person as he doesn't seem to care nor want to help, they said they'd take note but ultimately it's out of their hands. Which I do understand. Unfortunately I was put under his care again.

If I'm lucky, they will contact me once a month by phone call. I've told them my antidepressants aren't working - nothing has come of it. I've said that I'm not sure about my diagnosis of BPD (known as EUPD here in the UK), after looking at all of the resources they gave me and that fell on deaf ears.

I'm not sure what to do at this point, I feel my mental health starting to slip and I've not got a support network that I can rely on to make sure it doesn't get worse. 

I don't want to end up having another crisis but I'm not getting the help to prevent one."
742,Depression and motor skills / physical strength?,"I'm an athlete and through over 15 years of training and depression I've never noticed.

My physical ability and mental health are closely linked. I always thought that the injuries caused the depression but now I'm not so sure. So far I've only found one study which was in 60+ year olds: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6168750/"
743,I just... don't know what to do,"Hi!

I'm a girl (17 soon to be 18). I live in a small town where nothing really exciting happens. My father died 2 years ago from an accident at home, connected with his prolonged alcoholism and because of that my mom sometimes has emotional breakdowns and cries. She blames herself for what happened and has severe depression and panic attacks which were diagnosed before I was born and my father had depression too he was even suicidal. 

My problems began when I started high school at the age of 14/15. On my first day, I had a nervous breakdown in front of my new class because I was afraid that nobody would like me or want to talk to me and they probably thought that I was weird. So yeah I didn't really connect to anyone there and I guess I still don't. The first few weeks I was constantly crying, had stress dreams every night and couldn't bear to go to school without a pill to calm me down. Anyway, I continued on trying to make some friends which didn't happen. I spent the next two years completely friendless, I stayed home did my homework listened to music and slept. My parents were arguing a lot which they had been doing since I was little. I was always afraid or crying.

Then I became a 10th grader things got better I reconciled with an old friend of mine from my class who I had hurt years ago by choosing another friend over her (this so-called friend did the same to me later). This old friend is friends with almost everyone from the class and she is cheerful and lively and beautiful... just everything that I'm not. Then I started going out with her company and it was pretty cool she started changing though. She said I was her best friend but she didn't show it much. Then I got a boyfriend and we drifted apart even more. Now I don't know if we are friends or not (we never really talked in school just sometimes went home together).

I managed to find friends from my class but they seem to have other closer friends to hang out with and I just feel excluded and isolated. They all try to be liked by the popular ones from my class. 

I'm just confused and tired of everything. I don't know what I want in the future I haven't decided on a profession I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I've been having breakdowns a lot, moments when I cry, scream and just want everything to end. My whole body shivers and my heart beats very fast and there are these thought like I'm about to die and I just feel like I can't breathe.

I don't know what to do and I have no one to share this with if someone out there knows something that I can do to fix my situation please tell me."

I never used to harm, but now my thighs are scarred. Now I have another thing to be self-conscious about. I can't keep getting up everyday and going to work with this feeling. I honestly feel like I'm the walking dead. Following the same old stupid mind numbing routine and fantasising about running into traffic. So much had happened in my family the last year. My sister threatened to kill herself Sunday. I went to cheer her up and we got into a fist fight. How? Why? 
I don't want to do this anymore. At work now waiting to go home in 7 1/2 hrs."
747,looking for advice for my friend,"i've been thinking about this for a while, and thought why not ask here. my friend has been showing signs of depression (don't wanna self-diagnose her, but she's just been Really down for a few years and similar to me, who has clinical depression). her parents won't let her see a psychologist/psychiatrist, because they believe she doesn't need it and that they just want to pump her full of pills. it really hurts me to see her struggling so much and her parents not doing anything. she's talked to them about this a few times already, but she always gets shut down. she's 19 years old, but obviously still dependent on her parents. 
i'm in therapy myself, and my parents have always been really supportive, so i really don't know what to do. i've thought about asking my psychologist what she/i could do to help her stand up against her parents, but i don't know if that's appropriate?
if any of you have experiences like this or any kind of advice, i'd appreciate it a lot. thanks in advance:)"
748,Anybody else experience a different kind of low when seeking help?,"Is it normal to be start climbing out and then fall back into the pits? Anyone else go through this? How long were you in this spot?

I've struggled with anxiety and depression for many years and only started therapy 4 months ago. My counselor referred me to the school psychiatrist to help speed up my recovery process. 

I'm in my last sem of college and I don't know if I'll have access to mental health services afterwards. Which I do worry about because ""what if I'm still not better by graduation?"". (I struggle a lot with the ""what if"" scenarios. Been working on it with the ""what's the worst that can happen? What is likely"" which has been working for me).

I started takings an antidepressant in mid Jan along with a sleep aid. The first week on these meds was amazing. I was finally able to sleep. 

This is now week 4 and I feel down and have an overwhelming ""I don't care"" type of mentality. The sleep aid isn't quite working for me anymore either. 

TL;DR
Meds helped with anxiety and depression for about a week and then I started feeling down again. I'm relatively new to mental health and getting help. Wondering if anyone else has been in similar spot and what happened?"
749,Is it weird that I‘ve had romantic and sexual relationships but never fell in love?,"So I‘ve been wondering about an issue I just can’t get out of my head the last couple of days. I‘m a 17 year old male who has suffered from anxiety and depression. Even though I love the time I spend with people I deem as attractive I‘ve never felt the urge of needing to be with a particular person. If they vanished I could go on to find a new one. Also it Never happens that I see someone in public and I go like I need to be with that person. I only make a move towards someone if I‘m bored and don’t have anything to do. Am I too emotionless? For me it just seems very weird the idea of falling in love when you see a person. It almost feels like someone needs to be mentally ill to do that, even though I know that exactly the opposite is probably true."
750,"I feel like being suicidal and depressed is selfish of me, I don’t have a valid reason to justify these feelings. Anyone else feel the same?","I suffer from anxiety disorder, manic depression disorder and suicidal ideation on the daily. Suicidal ideation especially, nobody knows about as I’ve always kept it to myself, but I really want to tell someone as things seem to be getting worse but I just can’t bring myself to it.

I don’t know how to express these thoughts I have, I feel like my suicidal ideation isn’t justified and because of that I’m scared to speak to anyone about that part of my mental health in case I get shunned.

I see it as a selfish thing, the fact that I’m feeling the way I am and thinking these things when people have it far worse and have valid reasons for experiencing these things. But again I just don’t have a good reason, I come from a middle class family, good upbringing, no trauma in life, parents didn’t divorce, in law school and doing reasonably well etc etc. Nothing in my life has stood out as a moment that caused these feelings and because of that I’m genuinely afraid to talk about them, because In theory I have no right to feel the way I do.

Does anyone else have a similar experience like this? And what’s the best way to overcome this?"
751,abandoned by the crisis centre.,"sunday night I tried to commit suicide. I took a lot of pills and was brought to the hospital by the ambulance. I had to stay there for 1 night. the next day the hospital psychiatrist came and talked to me. he said he would leave it to the crisis centre (it's like the first aid for mental problems) and that they would most definitely send me to a mental hospital. it may sound weird but this is what I want. I cant stay at home anymore because I'm a danger to myself. 

once we got home we got the call from the crisis centre. they said they were not going to send me to a mental hospital. they offered me to have an appointment tomorrow (so today) to talk about how we can prevent this in the future. I had a major mental break down and got really violent. the police came because I wanted to stab myself with a knife. and also the ambulance. they stayed for over an hour and then left because there wasn't really anything they could do. my mom called the crisis centre again to explain that I was getting out of hand again. their answer was: if your daughter tries to kill herself again, put her under a hot shower and tell her everything is going to be okay. I was again so upset that my mother had to medicate me.

today i have the appointment at the crisis centre. I don't know what's going to happen. but yesterday on the phone they said the appointment will be about how I can get though the days and how to prevent this from happening again. the thing is, it's too late for that. the chances of me trying to kill myself again are 100%. but they dont take me seriously and dont want to help me. 

I don't know what to do anymore... and my parents dont know either. the situation is too dangerous and i cant stay home. my mom is now trying to get a lawyer and if nothing helps to go to the media. 

I'm posting this here because I hope someone can give me soms advise. maybe there is something ky parents and I can do that we haven't thought of. 

also some extra information: I am 20 years old, female and live in the Netherlands. I was sexually abused for almost a decade as a child, my parents divorced, I was bullied for also almost a decade at school and I have autism which we didnt know for 17 years, which resulted in me being treated very badly at home (not because they weren't good parents, because they are the best, but because they didnt know how to treat me). as a result I have severe ptsd, depression and anxiety. and as I stated before I have autism. I cant work, cant go to school, cant do sports or other hobbies and almost never had friends. at this moment I have one girl I can sort of call a friend and u have a boyfriend. so I'm not completely alone and very thankful for that. 

I'm in the beginning fase of being treated for my trauma. I know I'm in good hand and I will have very intensive therapy. so I'm not looking for therapy. I'm looking for a place to go where I am safe, I cant stay home anymore. 

I hope someone can help me or give me some tips to get me on the right track to recovery. 

I flagged this as NSFW since my message contains information about suicide. and I can understand not everyone on this subreddit is comfortable or stable enough to read such things."

I remember my mental going on a big decline before the meds started to kick in previously. Having been through it before, will I gain the benefits of the meds quicker at all? Or will my body do what it did before where it's a struggle at the start for a few weeks?

759,I only open up when the glass is full,"I have trust issues, and it all started when I was younger when friends would betray me and steal something from me. That’s why it’s hard for me to trust someone, even if it means losing their friendship. I don’t tell anyone my secrets or anything about me because I’m scared they’ll use it against me, I have no problem with making friends but I keep it clear and vague. 

I’m 15 years old, and I’m a girl. I take counseling at school after my teacher told me I was pale, that’s when I broke down into tears and told her everything. I tried attempting suicide at least thrice now. So they referred me to this friendly German sister, she helps me a lot with my problems in terms of overthinking, anxiety and depression. She told me I only open up when I’m overwhelmed, which is the bad part because people who don’t talk about themselves are usually the ones who die without saying anything. 

I hate people, they irritate me so much. From 15 years of my life, growing up, I was bullied for my appearance. I was forced by my teachers and peers to fit in, and I have no satisfaction from it what so ever. It’s bland and boring. When you do something wrong, they act as if you murdered a person. A little tiny act can break everything apart, I’m so done with being pressured. I hate it when they make fun of me about my mental health, not all is fortunate enough to be blessed with happiness! 

I’m also a wrathful person, I tend to get physical and argumentative with people during fights. I want everything to be fair and just. They don’t understand at all, and stick to one thinking. It’s fucking amazing."

I DO smoke pot daily...maybe half a gram or so in the evenings...I’ve wondered if maybe it’s throwing off my hormones...

I’m a 36 year old guy and I really don’t understand why I wake up like this every day...."
762,To be seen,"I think it’d be cool to feel seen, that’s really the best feeling in the world. But I don’t wanna change myself to make myself easier to be seen. I don’t know, being seen is just so important and it’s hard to ignore it and just do your own thing sometimes. Anyway, have a great day! Or night!"
763,I feel like I’m starting to act like a kid again,I think this is do to me being so depressed and anxious once I entered high school that I felt like I didn’t experience my youth properly. Now that I may be going to college after taking a year off I feel like a kid again. I think taking time away from school allowed me the time I needed to heal. What I’m doing now feels like catching up to things I should have already done. The shows and movies I always liked as a kid but was too embarrassed to say that I liked is where I first picked up. After that I started watching movies that I was interested in a few years ago but never watched because everything made me anxious. Now I have to learn to make friends which is something I seem to have forgotten how to do.
764,How to find the right therapist?,So I am looking to find a therapist. However I am lost in the process of doing so. How do you narrow your search where there are probably hundreds of different therapists in your area? Or how do you know that once you have picked one if they are the right fit? Obviously you can't make an impression until you meet them but it would seem ridiculous to schedule an appointment with a different therapist each week just to see if you like them.
765,My personality doesn't match my appearance.,"I've always found it strange how I can change so much depending on which vibe I'm feeling, but the thing is my personality changes but my appearance doesn't.

I feel like I can't be myself because of the way I look, certain people I can't associate with because the way I look. I don't think I'm bad looking, I just don't match my personality. Alot of my friends said they were surprised when they got to know me because I just don't act like you would think. 

It's actually soul breaking to have to keep these personalities secret. 

But I'm still me you know, it's not like I don't know when I change.

Nothing to do about it though, just venting, I'll keep daydreaming of looking a certain way."

767,Today's Mental Health Help. Who Wants Some?,"This is no trick or scam. I'm not asking for money. All I'm getting out of this is experience and helping others. I'm an advocate for Mental Health and pursuing a career in Councelling and volunteering to do this. Who wants to discuss openly: their mental health troubles that are stopping them from their goals, are open to try new things from an unbiased person; the life changing things I know that have impacted others; and understands this will only work if you welcome change (including things you may or may not be doing preventing you from reaching your goals)?"
768,I'm not able to help myself!!!!! (SUICIDAL THOUGHTS)," I always lived as an outcast from my school days. I only had one friend (haven't seen him from high school graduation). I was always loner even from my school days, I never had you know like really good friends with one whom I could share stuff with (happy or sad) . But when I came to college I thought I should change and make some friends but , I've always had distance with people I couldn't get together with people well. (Socially awkward all my life). But things changed when I got friends with this one girl. She and her boyfriend were very close to me we used to hang out all the time. she was the only person with whom I used to share my emotions, she used console me when I'm sad or when I get hung up on something. She was the only person who never looked down on me, but always stood with me and supported me always. But recently i don't know why she started to get annoyed when I talked to her or when ever I said anything. She's avoiding me and I'm not able to get myself together ever since. I've tried to talk to her, message her. But still getting the same reply. (sometimes she leaves me on seen on wont even reply). I've gotten to attached to her, the very thought that she isn't talking to me is driving me crazy. I had never imagined that a day like this would come. Me being isolated all my life and suddenly getting attached to someone and stop talking to them now all of a sudden . Is killing me. I tried self-hurt but couldn't muster up courage to commit suicide. But still I'm having these recurring suicidal thoughts over this issue. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!"
769,I'm not really sure what's with my self-esteem,"Hello guys!  


So, starting off, I'd like to outline my situation. I'm the only child, son of truly wonderful parents who have always been truly supportive and caring people. I do have some real friends - people who never let me down and offered support whenever I needed it. I also tend to excel at almost all of the school subjects (not my opinion really, just based upon my grades).  


Yet, here comes my greatest trouble - I always stress myself the hell out before any test, quiz or any kind of activity which might lead to me receiving grade at school. I study a lot, spend most of my free time devoted to subject books but not only does it not help with stress but actually only makes me more anxious.  
 I really would love to find a way to relieve myself of that stress. I have been trying physical exercises, yet they only work for the time being - during exercising I feel really proud of myself and enjoy it, but as soon as I finish, tide of negativity storms my mind again. I also used to paint and draw a lot, as well as read various books, not connected with school at all, but during the school year, I can't force myself to do these activities because my mind can't stop thinking about assignments I have to do or tests I have to take soon.   


Thank you all for reading and if any of you have any kind of advice, I would be truly glad to hear them.  
I wish you all a wonderful day and hope that you are having a great time!"
770,I pulled a 14yo girl out of a lake during a suicide attempt 5 years ago. Today she served me my drink in the pub.,"So 5 years ago I was walking my dog around the local lake late one night after a 12hr work day. I was tired, in a rather low state of mind all around and just felt entirely stagnant in my life.

Towards the end of our usual route around the water there's a wooden footbridge you have to cross to return to the entrance which leads in to the supermarket carpark, as we were crossing this bridge I see what I straight away say to be a young girl thrashing around about 50m from the bridge and water's edge. 

I didn't even think about it, I quickly tied Tazz, my dog, to the bridges fence climbed over and jumped in and swam to her as fast as I possibly could and helped her out. 

When I reached solid ground with her again I remember just deflating for awhile as she explained how she thought she wanted to die till the moment she was in the water and how she couldn't swim. She promised me she would receive treatment. 

It gave me another outlook too, and really pushed me towards a career change and the positive changes in my life that resulted in my son, living in America for two years and other things.

I returned to England late last November around my 24th birthday and this morning decided to visit the pub I always used to frequent with my brother as a younger man, ordered at the bar and sat down to wait on my pint and breakfast.

Who else would walk over to serve me my food? Her, still looking the same though a little older. A beautiful young woman now of 20 years old. The recognition was instant, and she sat and spoke to me for awhile as I drank waiting on my food. She was telling me about how she's thinking of attending university to study neurological science, I told her about my current fight with my ex wife to see my son. How I'd had thoughts of suicide these past few months, recently thought I'd found love again to yesterday have it tore from me at the time I was most in need of her...

After I left I attended my work appointments as usual, interviews, did a bit of writing and then skipped lunch and took the afternoon off (I'm self employed) to ponder the conversation and how after everything I went full circle and she may have just saved my life after all these years. The way I once did hers."
771,What does it mean when a program has been lumped?,"Just got back to Clubhouse today (for those that know what the program is, no explaining needed, others, ask your case workers, but it is a mental health program), and was seeing the notes saying that our program &amp; our sister site got ""lumped"". All the staff are currently working with other members and I figured I could get a better understanding by asking here."
772,I have lost my myself in my mind,"I dont kowe how I can't remember ho I was a couple of years ago and if I go to sleep I watch myself die over and over again and I can see myself being killed on a daily basis

775,"Thoughts on gossip, mindfulness, bullying and being supportive"," 

Here's my contribution to raising mental health awareness, let's start with a wee anecdotal tale.

There's things that people have control of as an individual with regards to those around them and things they don't.

Some of the major things that can influence people's mental health are finances/debt, grief/trauma/loss, illness, homelessness and social connections/loneliness/isolation. The one you are most likely to be able to make a impact on, positively or negatively is the social interaction one.

""A group of psychologists performed an experiment years ago. They started with a cage containing five monkeys. Inside the cage, they hung a banana on a string with a set of stairs placed under it. Before long, a monkey went to the stairs and started to climb towards the banana. As soon as he started up the stairs, the psychologists sprayed all of the other monkeys with ice-cold water. After a while, another monkey made an attempt to obtain the banana. As soon as his foot touched the stairs, all of the other monkeys were sprayed with ice-cold water. It wasn’t long before all of the other monkeys would physically prevent any monkey from climbing the stairs.

Now, the psychologists shut off the cold water, removed one monkey from the cage and replaced it with a new one. The new monkey saw the banana and started to climb the stairs. To his surprise and horror, all of the other monkeys attacked him. After another attempt and attack, he discovered that if he tried to climb the stairs, he would be assaulted. Next, they removed another of the original five monkeys and replaced it with a new one. The newcomer went to the stairs and was attacked. The previous newcomer took part in the punishment with enthusiasm! Likewise, they replaced a third original monkey with a new one, then a fourth, then the fifth.

Every time the newest monkey tried to climb the stairs, he was attacked. The monkeys had no idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs or why they were beating any monkey that tried. After replacing all the original monkeys, none of the remaining monkeys had ever been sprayed with cold water. Nevertheless, no monkey ever again approached the stairs to try for the banana. Why not? Because as far as they know that’s the way it’s always been around here.""

Now, in the tale above there's a skoosh of water hitting the initial monkeys.

If we replace the water with a person, and the initial monkeys as a couple of people who benefit from causing problems for the person, and the replacement monkeys as third parties there's a new dynamic to that problem.

The problem comes in that the new people are attacking because of hear'say.

If in that case, you're one of the new people, you've no meaningful way of verifying that the target of your attacks are deserving of your wrath, other than the other new people around you.

Sure, you can perhaps find the original attacking person , and find out what the issue was, and the target person might be behaving odd, but perhaps you're the 100th person to attack them, and they're a bit worse for wear for it. The original aggressor person has an army of people fighting on their behalf, and they're all incensed because of all the other angry people around them, all shouting in chorus.

You can ask the original target person what happened, but of course the original one is going to be upset, angry and defensive. You'd think the original person will say anything to counter or stop the attack, so you devalue anything they say.

The only thing the target person can do at this point, is curl up, and take the beating.

The only thing that makes it better for the target person is if other people think for themselves, but then they're not keeping in line with their peers, and it's challenging to break out of an echo chamber, especially if the attacking monkeys think they're justified.

This can take its toll on the original person, and they can give up, and not see the point in going on.

You then can put this down to the person being unstable, and that it was always going to be an eventuality, because of their life choices, an obvious miserable demeanour, etc. Tragic as it may be, you feel sorry for the target, and wish society would do more for those that fell through the gaps, you think.

You post ""be kind"" on your facebook banner, and console the people who originally knew the target.

You like a TED talk on bullying, and post on mental health awareness day.

Then you hear about this other person who deserves your condemnation, rinse, repeat.

Maybe that target person wasn't a great person, maybe they did have a quarrel with the aggressor, maybe it was legitimate, and maybe it wasn't. The target isn't going to fight their corner, they don't know which people are acting as proxies for the original aggressor, and who isn't. At this point the target want's nothing but peace and resolution. But you don't know that, because you don't think to ask, and they can't respond to you anyway. The point is either way, it's not your quarrel, and you need to look at why you're attacking the target, and what's the benefit.

Generally, people don't gossip or talk about people for wholesome reasons. It might not always be done with intent, and sometimes it might.

If you can apply your actions to that of school children in a play ground, you should address them. But you don't stop to think and do that.

The point is, most people's lives can be made better with actual kindness, if you take everyone as you find them, then you're not just picking the deserving. The people who slip through the cracks are quite often pushed by those doing it unknowingly, or with misguided intentions."
776,Accepting my life the way it is is hard.,"I just want to find someone I’m in love with, start a family, finish school, start a career I love, and be content with an imperfect but satisfying life. Yet, my physical and mental health always seem to get in the way. I’ll probably just end up alone."
777,Any reasons as to why I should keep living?,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts for a long time, and the conclusion I’ve come to is that I’ll continue living for the sake of my friends and family. I don’t want them to be hurt. But living for the sake of other people is hard because I just find it so difficult to be me. I’ve had issues with mental illness forever, lately my anxiety has been so bad it prevents me from sleeping and I cry all the time. I’m tired of feeling tired and bad. Is there really anything worth sticking around for in this world besides the feelings of those around me? I need something to keep me going or else I think i’ll break"
778,"Wishing I had options for wife. Broke and paying off debt. Scholarships, anything like that?","I feel like I know the answer to this but I figured I'd ask anyway. 

Long story short...in all my conversations with my wife over the years, it just feels like she's been at a brick wall with her development with a lot of things. She's been able to come to terms with a lot of issues, but generally, she cannot seem to progress with anything, either personally or professionally. She's had plenty of therapy over the years, and was misdiagnosed bipolar at a young age.( I'm not a professional, but I do think that medication at a young age has stunted her emotional development)

It's at the point where we've both said like...we wish she could live in a home for 6 months or something. I've been fortunate enough to have more therapy than her over the years, but she definitely has more to discuss than I do. I wish she could get the help she deserves. But as you probably know, such treatment is expensive, and is out of our reach given the current state of our debt and health insurance. She can't seem to ""self therapize"" herself and can't buy into anything I try to show her (books, videos, etc). She just has a lot of trauma that the typical platitudes can't help with.

I want to help her more than anything in the world and I just don't know how. We can get her like, regular therapy visits, but this won't happen for months until we've paid off some of the debt that is currently weighing us down. And unfortunately, I'm the only one bringing in income, so we've generally hit a wall in terms of how much extra money we can bring in this year.

**tldr; I don't suppose that any of these in-patient treatment centers offer anything like scholarships or something that we could apply for? Thanks so much for any help.**"
779,I don’t want to live like this anymore.,"I’d always been overweight all my life. Only when I turned 16 last year did i decide to do something about it. By March 2019, i was a whopping 85kg, mind you i’m 166cm. So I did what anybody who’s trying to lose weight would do– i dieted, i exercised. Everything was normal, i started off with cutting out junk foods and sweet drinks, strictly drinking plain water. But even then my weight wasn’t dropping as fast as i’d like it to. So then i added in exercise in the mix which is healthy, but I also started depending on laxatives. Only then did my weight start dropping dramatically. 

I started challenging myself more, counting my calories and making sure that I had a negative net intake. I didn’t think anything was wrong with me, i thought that eating only 400 calories day by day was alright. Even when my period went missing up till this day, when my hair is falling out in clumps in the shower, when random bruises appear all over my leg, when I have sudden moments where i pass out– i still feel like I’m not allowed to say that I have a problem.

Fast forward almost a year and i’ve dropped 35kg. I’ve gone from overweight with a bmi of 30.8 to underweight with a bmi of 18.1. if you can’t already tell, i’ve gotten addicted to not only laxatives but numbers as well. Everyone was happy for me, congratulating me on my weight loss, asking me how did i do it, thoughtlessly poking me in my belly and saying “oh no you’ve still got a bit of a pouch there”. Can’t they tell that I’m not functioning well? Every time I hear anything related to my physique, i feel like an absolute failure. Mind you, they were the same people urging me to lose weight, constantly reminding that i’m fat when i was at my heaviest. 

Anyways, i guess the main thing that’s been bugging me lately is how I don’t want to live like this anymore. I want to get out of this restrictive mindset and for once actually love my body for what it is. I don’t want to keep blacking out, i want my hair to be healthy again, i want to stop dehydrating myself by my constant abuse of laxatives. I want a fresh new start where I never started starving myself in the first place. I’m not saying that i’m anorexic or anything, but i’d really like to get rid of my disordered thoughts and eat without worrying about the calories. 

I know some of yall will suggest that I go to a therapist or an equivalent to that. But i’m still considered a minor and i would need parental consent to seek help. My parents are very conservative people and they don’t believe in things like eating disorders. They in fact encourage and enforce it in the household, for eg. It’s become a bit of a challenge to see who will be able to lose the most weight or who will burn the most calories or who will be able to run the longest for them at least. I’d just like to hear your thoughts on this and i hope if you’ve read this far, that you didn’t mind my venting."
780,My whole family makes me feel sick .,"My mom emotionally abused me my whole life and i understand the fact that she was abused too in her life by her own parents. But now when i think about her parents ( my grandparents ) i feel repulsed, is this normal ?"
781,People should stop saying “everybody gets depressed”.,"I understand that normal life events such as breakup and loss can trigger clinical depression, but for 90% of people of the time that does not happen. It’s the same way most people go through trauma without developing PTSD. I know somebody who developed clinical depression after her dad died but most people who grief do not develop clinical depression."
782,Suicidal,"I don't know I try to be positive and after a while things don't go the way I wanted it to be and I would be back to being suicidal. I tried to cut myself but I'm scared it would become a thing I'm addicted to. For now, I just slam my head at the wall or punch myself in the face. 

I think I also have a mental problem but I'm not so sure because I was never diagnosed. I'm thinking of anxiety and ADHD. For anxiety my whole body shakes when doing something Infront of people even though I know I'm doing the right thing it just happens. For ADHD maybe because I'm always forgetful and lose focus like in class I will always try to focus but it just fades away and I would be thinking about something else like my current problem or my future. Also, I feel very uncomfortable sitting at chair for hours. Maybe I'm just overreacting? If I'm just overreacting please give me some advice in how to avoid it I've been googling it and it seems just to come back to me nothing helps. Thank you."
783,I asked my mom to take me to the mental hospital because I’m suicidal and she said “you always throw suicide in my face to get what you want”,I don’t even know what I would want other than to be content again.
784,My depression is impacting my college attendance.,"This is my third semester in a row at a new university. I failed out of the other two. While I have good grades right now, I’m not too optimistic my attendance will keep up. I have these stints of depression where I can barely get out of bed before noon. It’s probably fatigue from my insomnia + general apathy toward life and it has impacted work and school to where I feel like a failure. I have disappointed my family in so many ways. I want to do better, but I don’t know how. I’ve invested so much into finishing my degree, and for what if I’m unable to show up or study when it matters...

Has anybody else had this problem in the past?"
785,empty feeling it chest,"for the past year or so there's been a constant physical feeling of emptiness in my chest, like there's a hole. it only goes away when someone hugs me or i put a soft object directly where i feel it. could this be a medical thing or am i just lonely ?"
786,Heartbroken,"I just had to break up with my love of 5+ years because they're obsessed with the idea of hooking up/having sex with other people. And I'm hoping they realize that the reality of that isn't all they've built it up to be in their head. But I am absolutely shattered. We were going to get married. I still want to marry them. My self esteem and body issues arent fantastic on a good day, but today they've hit an all time low. I have a miserable string in the past of being the placeholder and then abandoned when something better comes along, but I never imagined I'd be in a situation where I'm abandoned for a bunch of future potential people. Is loving me so bad that it can be given up so easily? In the choice between loving me forever or having sex with some future strangers, am I so awful that I dont get to be chosen? I'm just not enough, worth enough to be kept? And it's better a choice to pick rando sex, than a relationship with me?

I used to wake up every day thinking how lucky I was that this wonderful person loved me. But I guess I'm finally not enough, because my luck just ran out. I dont want to wake up tomorrow. Alone."
787,The fear of being Fired,"I'm posting this more for curiosity of if I am unusual for this or if this is truly a common fear.

I work a job where I have been told by many different departments that I am valuable, and this has been reflected in a perfect annual review the past 2 years (since I started working here). Everyone at my company appreciates me and I feel their appreciation. But for some reason I live in a constant fear of being fired. I have no guilty conscience, I do my job and I do with well with minimal wasted time on my phone at work.

I feel like my fear isn't necessarily directed at me or my company I think I may just have a misunderstanding about how common firings are. I have this impression that they are common and that companies are always looking for you to slip up so they would have an excuse to fire you. In my two years at this company I have never made a mistake but every time I almost make one I think ""Glad I caught that or I would have been fired""

Are firings really that common, and do any of you think about your ability to be fired on a daily basis?"
788,Anxious Extrovert,Haha does anyone else feel the need to constantly be surrounded by people even if you're not in the mood to actually talk. At this point I'll even just sit in the library since I don't always want to be particularly noticed or spoken to sometimes but I really hate being completely alone.
789,Just Needed To Talk,"Hi, I’m woahthatwasclose and I have an ED, body dysmorphia and depression. I feel... okay? Still some shitty days here and there but... it’s getting better. I don’t want to punch the mirror everytime I see myself anymore. And I’ve been noticing that laughing ironically suprisingly makes me feel better. 
The reason I’m not dead yet is the future. That game I’m waiting for to come out (Animal Crossing New Horizons, SO FUCKING EXCITED), a sudden urge to get inspired and draw for hours. Small things like that makes me feel seperated from my dark thoughts. 
I gained weight. Even though I don’t see my face or body accurately, it’s... not that bad! 
Recovery from a bloody eating disorder feels amazing. And this time I know I’m dedicated. Actually you know what? My skin is glowing, serotonin is my bitch. Those useless numbing antidepressants can suck my positivity.
With this great mindset I feel like I can put a bandaid on my old manipulative therapists wounds. I’m currently searching for a new one! The issue is my social life. I lost a really close friend of mine on Valentine’s Day. We were supposed to go out like “friends”. And guess who had a crush on that particular friend? MY DUMB ASS. She said that her intentions were NEVER ROMANTICALLY and that’s ok!!!!! But I panicked and blocked her everywhere. The thing I did is really toxic and I know I need to explain myself buT I don’t know how. Please help! 
Thank you for reading. :)"
790,Watching someone destroy themselves.,[removed]
791,Having paranoia of no one being real but me,"Im (14) on the autism spectrum so this could just be a problem that my mind is creating but im afraid no one else is real and im the only person alive.
     Im afraid that everyone around me isn't real or doesnt exist so it doesn't matter what i do in life because its only I that exists, making nothing really matter. 
    Lots of paranoia is overtaking me, ruining my happiness and will to stay alive
         This thought has been creeping up on me for the past few weeks or months, slowly. 
   I used to go to therapy for unrelated reason, problems with my mum, depression, and anxiety but she wont let me go anymore so i cant say anything to anyone about my thoughts.
    I know that if i say anything to my friend or even family, they will make jokes that would increase my stress, or think im crazy. 
    My mum normally just tells me the thoughts i have are just hormones or the teen angst and dismisses them. I don't have a father or any other family near i can talk to 
         Sometimes though, i get these moments of clarity i guess, where i think things like ""there are billions of people on this earth, someone has to be real, it cant just be me"" 
   I dont know if this is a normal thing others experience but i want to live normally without having this constant pang of  stress and fear on my mind.
     I hope someone can help me with this because im tired of this.   
      Also sorry for any grammarical errors or the writing skills being poor"
792,Anxiety,Ive been having really bad panic attacks im on buspar but it doesnt seem to be helping at all i see my med dr in 2 days and was wondering what meds have helped others with bad panics so i can explore my options when i see my dr
793,Pros and Cons of Punishment,"Pros
- Good for dangerous behaviors 
- Temporary suppression provides opportunity to reinforce more desirable behavior

Cons
- Frequently ineffective
- May be replaced by even less desirable behavior 
- Physical punishment has harmful side-effects (fear, lowered self esteem)
- Doesn't relay information about alternative, more desirable behavior"
794,"So I’ve told everyone I loved them today, and asked never to hate me. I think I’m ready to kill myself, just trying to figure out what option I like most.",
795,Do you have to act on your thoughts to have an eating disorder?,"I’m constantly feeling bad about the way I look, and I have thoughts of starving myself all the time. I usually find an excuse not to do it (I’m paying for a meal plan so I should use it, or my boyfriend would be sad, or something like that). The thoughts are absolutely still there and even when I do eat I feel horrible and keep thinking about how I should stop eating so much even though I know I don’t eat that much. 
This has been a really big problem recently, because I’m currently doing a section in my biology class on digestion and every class he talks about BMIs and obesity and I spend the entire class period thinking about my own weight. 
I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but never had any kind of diagnosis for this. I just want to know if this is a normal thing that other people experience or if it’s a concern. I don’t usually act on my thoughts, so I don’t know if it would really count as an eating disorder because I still eat normally."
796,Unhealthy habits,"It feels as if I just woke up from a bad dream. As if I've been walking around on auto-pilot for maybe a month just doing what seemed reasonable in the moment. 

I ate a solid meal for the first time in maybe a month today and it had me questioning what I have been doing to myself lately. I've been eating fast food, candy and almost only drinking soda for a whole month. Now that I have a shortage of money I finally snapped out of it. The thing isn't that I really feel bad or even sad over what I've done. It's more that I spend all my time alone and have been doing so for such a long time that I feel that I have no reference to normality apart from living in chaos and doing what feels good for the moment."
797,What Are These Episodes Called?,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis or anything, I'm just wondering if there is a common name I can use when talking to my therapists about them.

We've just been calling them panic attacks as they manifest those symptoms (high heart rate, trouble breathing, panic) but they're combined with heavy suicidal thoughts, feelings of worthlessness, an entire loss of will to live. They last at most 2 hours long and afterwards I am... fine. It's like a switch is flipped and I'm okay. I struggle with mild (mostly seasonal) depression and moderate anxiety but these have always been kind of strange to me, especially since they're more or less a recent phenomena (five years at most), and they happen at odd times. Depending on my mental state they happen anywhere between once a month and twice a week, and absolutely exhaust all my energy for the next day or so. I've had them while driving, before going to bed, in the middle of work. Can panic attacks manifest with deep depressive and suicidal thoughts, or is this something different altogether?"
798,I really need help,"Hullo,

I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I am in desperate need of some clarity. Up until this point in my life, I feel like I've really tried to be a better person. I'm not saying I'm a good person, because how will I ever know if I'm a good person? But I feel like I try to do the right thing. I have a person in my life that is unavoidable because well, they're family  and you can't really escape that when they're living under the same roof as you and we recently got into a little tiff, over something quite petty - house chores and her lack of involvement in them. But my discontent with this person has been brewing for a while now due to reasons other than her laziness e.g. she's only one year older than me but when you make a mistake she'll try to discipline you (this goes back to when I was in my teens) rather than letting my parents handle the situation but I feel as though it's because my father gave her the room and validation to be the authority figure - she's been both physically and emotionally abusive (more emotional than physical but it still stands) but I couldn't speak on it because confrontation usually leads to what I thought was a manipulative situation where she would flip the script and invalidate everything I've just said and how I feel to victimise herself. Every person in the family has had an issue with this person at some point and they've expressed that behind their back because they are too scared to tell this person how they actually feel to their face because of how EXPERT she is at making you feel as though you are the guilty one and that she is the wronged one. Well, she told me everything that she thinks I do wrong... She said I'm overly critical of everyone and everything and that I'm toxic because I only have two friends from high school and she has lots of friends (after high school I suffered from quite a bad spout of depression and anxiety, those of which I still am struggling with today and after high school I kind of isolated myself, hence the reason I only managed to bring two really good friends along with me - I'm now 23 at university), she said I'm a pathological liar because she accused me of saying something which I'm 100% sure I didn't say, so I denied saying it, but she was adamant that I said it and then said I forget what I say half the time when I genuinely don't think that's true. She has a habit of saying hurtful things to people and then when someone confronts her on it, she denies saying it. She said that I have no one around me, and undermined everything I do to help the house out - she does nothing btw - and made it seem like I have absolutely no moral compass.

I thought I was doing okay and thought I was a decent person but now I'm spiraling because I either got manipulated into being the guilty one in this situation or I genuinely am a nasty shitty person and I have no idea what to feel, I'm just so confused.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do to sort my head out?!"
799,"I've been ""spacing out"" recently- is this normal?","So I have chronic depression, social anxiety, and ADHD.

Now, I have complete control over my ADHD since I've been treated from a young age. I know when my mind starts to wander or not paying attention and I have tricks to keep me from doing that. Lately, however, it's been causing me problems.

I've been spacing out more often than not nowadays. I've always had problems with it for forever and it's the hardest thing for me to block out. I'll suddenly find myself staring at something, almost hypnotized by whatever it is (usually a part of a wall, a locker, someone's shoe).

Now I know you might be thinking ""Oh, that's just ADHD, you're just not paying attention!"" No, this is completely different. I don't think when this happens. 

The longest it's been is hard for me to say, I think it was a minute or two, it was while my dad was talking to me about school stuff. I came out of it when he asked me a question about a part I didn't hear. We were in the car, and when I ""spaced out"" we were near a golf course and, when I ""came to"" we were near a strip of twin houses. For reference, the houses near the course were big, in the woods. We were right next to a school. I really don't know how long I was out of it

Like I said, I don't think when this happens. When I space out, i'm usually thinking about stuff like the plot of the book I'm writing or a video i watched on YouTube. But for these I'm just... not aware of what's going on. I usually can piece some things together in situations like the car ride, from what I heard before, but it's just so odd for me.

What really got me worried was when it started happening when I was talking. I would randomly space out, for how long, who knows- not more than a minute, I'm pretty sure. And when I'd come back I'd just laugh and try to pick up where I left off, but I sometimes can't remember without help.

I would like to use the word ""dissociating"" but I don't know if it's the right term. I'm even having trouble writing this right now without my eyes trailing to the lockers in front of me. I've never had memory loss like that before, though I do forget being told stuff, where I put my things, etc, but I think that's just my memory.

I don't have periods of time where I forget stuff happening except for the usual stuff that humans forget. I don't have gaps of time missing. I really just want to know if this is normal, if it's just my ADHD becoming stronger, or if i should talk to someone about it. I know untreated depression can cause ""brain damage"" such as apathy and memory loss and, since I had it for over a year before being given a therapist and then not trying to get better for another year, i have both apathetic episodes and a poor memory.

But yeah. Could someone help me? It's been weird and I don't like how easy it is for me to slip into a dissociative state; happened during a test once, thankfully my teacher snapped me out of it. But yeah, thank you!!! &lt;3"
800,People constantly call me attention seeking and it hurts,I’m not attention seeking I’m suffering and I’ve tried to get help but no one listens..
801,I want to teach my roommate to sweep and mop the floors but idk how to breach the subject,"So I recently moved for university to a city with a 10 hour time difference from my home. My roommate is from a country close to mine and she moved a few months before I did. Me and my roommate are both adults (20F, both of us) and I’ve been doing all the cleaning throughout  the semester until this week, I got really sick from a bipolar relapse. So today, since we haven’t cleaned the floors in over 2 weeks, I asked her to do it since I usually do it every other week but I’m too sick this week. She made up something about not having the materials to do it with and I said she could use mine.

Well, she tried. I could see she was very embarrassed about it. She looked like a small child holding a broom for the first time. Sweeping everything everywhere. She has clearly never been taught how to sweep, I didn’t ask her to mop, and redid the sweeping myself even though I’m very depressed barely functional.

I think there’s a possibility that she’s had a bad childhood with either overprotective parents or negligent parents. Or maybe she doesn’t have parents at all. I’ve never seen her talk to anyone from her country. 

She usually treats me like I don’t exist. I think there’s something deeper to this and saying “hey, I’m gonna teach you to clean up after yourself” seems a little rude and insensitive. I’ve tried to open conversation by asking about her hobbies, by offering her a piece from my box of chocolates, or asking her to try to keep the room smelling ok. She never talks more than 2 sentences to me in one day. I want to help her but I am not sure how I can do that. I really want to get to know her and then teach her basic stuff like cleaning. How should I approach her?"
802,Is this possible OCD?,"I want to start off saying that I have been officially diagnosed with  excoriation disorder, Major depression, PTSD, General anxiety disorder, Binge eating disorder. I have previously been misdiagnosed and medicated for Bipolar disorder and had an episode of psychosis. My spouse and I after talking to a therapist also believe much of this is from an undiagnosed Autism spectrum disorder but my office does not do testing for adults without families as there is no background interview available.   
I have recently been diagnosed with the skin picking disorder and told to try to put band aids over my fingers to prevent the behavior and also keep my hands busy. My problem is however that it is not only my hands but my mind that can not stop thinking about it, like an itch that needs to be scratched. It is not just my skin either it is any imperfection on my skin or my spouses etc. Or sometimes it extends beyond skin. For example if I know I have locked my door behind me but my mind says to check the door again sometimes twice I get horrible anxiety if I try to ignore the voice. I will think about it all day. It feels irrational, like I feel like my house will burn down if I don't check the stove if 'the voice' tells me too more than once etc. I'm not looking for a diagnosis just a possible explanation that I can bring up to my irl therapist or if anyone else has similar issues and has advice."
803,Not understood,"Hi, so I need advice of what I can do.
I got PDD NOS and as it's not known a lot my parents don't understand what it means and how it affects me and my behavior. I was diagnosed as a child and never got help for it, I just recievied the label. I would figure that when I got diagnosed my parents got explained what it means and all that, but lately I feel like they have no idea what it means.

To be fair, I had no one around me who knew what it means, so I myself had to do a little research and so much about me got explained, I felt understood by multiple internet pages.

I also started to notice more and more how they don't understand what it means. 'Just explain it to them/show them an explanation' I tried. Multiple times. But they always say they understand it and know what it means.
But later they keep showing me they don't by literally telling me so. They make me feel like they don't even believe me when I say something happens because of pdd nos. 

I live in a constant state of not being understood and believed by my parents. I know no one who is diagnosed with pdd nos, with who i can share experiences and ask for help. 

My question now is, what is there left for me to do? I really need them to understand me, but how do you explain something to someone who won't listen."
804,Self destruct mode,"Does anyone know how to avoid going into self destruct the only thing holding me together is my medication and I kee hitting setbacks in referrals for therapy or home treatment teams and most days the medication doesn't help so I get rid of it and allow myself to decline and eventually lose control, I'm not sure on how to avoid these as I know it's doing more damage over time. I have EUPD, anxiety, depression and schizoaffective disorder so I'm not really doing well on good days but I really want to avoid these self destruct episodes any tips would be great."
805,I think I’m finally done,These last couple months have brought me down. I’ve been dealing with shit since middle school and I’m just over it. I’ve jeopardized my marriage because I’ve been trying to keep from letting go and gravely injuring myself but it takes everything to keep from doing that so the little shit I have no patience for which makes me constantly get angry. Everyone is always telling me I need to get help but every time I get close to doing that some bs comes along. I’m about to lose a very tight grip on this bs.
806,Mentally Ill Mental Health Professional,"Warning, long post, but I need to get this out. Hopefully this is the right place for this. I'm not really sure where to start. Also severely sleep-deprived (another ongoing problem), so I apologize for any mistakes. I was never diagnosed with any disorder as a child, although I did see a psychologist and Asperger's (Now Autism Spectrum Disorder) was mentioned several times. I know the criteria well and have felt for a long time as if I met the criteria for an Autism Spectrum Disorder, although I know that I would be considered high functioning. Up until graduate school I lived a mostly normal life. I did have a lot of social problems in school, and have always had difficulty understanding people and how they are supposed to interact with one another. I also have difficulty recognizing faces, and hypersensitivity to certain noises. 

I've also always had very specific and intense interests, and am rarely interested in talking to people. I have always had high intellectual (versus social) intelligence, and was often able to do well in high school, college, and even graduate school with minimal effort. I would rarely pay attention in school unless it was something I was interested in, but never had any academic problems. I loved being in school, actually, because everything was structured. There were classes with set criteria, and so long as I completed those criteria I succeeded. I'd write a 10-20 page term paper in a day and get full points, or study for an exam the night before and ace it. Everything was so simple to understand. Anyway, that's not the point.

I became interested in psychology, and looking back it was probably to figure out what was going on with myself. I completed a Bachelor's in Psychology, but the program was geared towards research psychology instead of clinical. For multiple reasons, some known to me and others I'm still trying to figure out, I decided to pursue a Psy.D (Doctor of Clinical Psychology) and work in the clinical field. At the time I thought it was something I could do, and I didn't have any understanding of what that field was really like. First year of grad school was basically undergraduate part II, and everything was great. I passed classes and did well. But in second year I began my first clinical practicum, and started having increasing problems sleeping. I eventually got sleep medication, which treated the problem for a while.

As I progressed in the program I began to realize that I did not like clinical work of any kind. Due to that and other life stressors I began smoking marijuana, and towards the end of the program I was smoking heavily. I want to clarify that I do not blame the substance, I believe marijuana can be used responsibly, but with my personality, it became my new ""intense interest"". It made all my doubts and anxieties go away, so I kept smoking more and more of it. TV shows, music, and food were so much better when I was stoned. Also not the point though.

By the time it really hit me that there was no area of clinical psychology I was interested in, it was too late. I had already racked up way too much student debt to quit, and so I finished the program. I was initially interested in forensic psychology, which led me towards correctional psychology. I completed an internship at a jail, which I hated, and then tried to get out of the mental health field by being a tutor. But I still had a substance abuse problem and just wasn't making enough money. So I got an unlicensed postdoctoral position at a prison, moved across the country, and tried to start over. I convinced myself I could do it. I quit marijuana for awhile, but, well, the state I moved to was California, so I was there for barely a month before I started smoking again.

Working at the prison nearly drove me to suicide several times. I worked four ten-hour shifts, with Saturday, Sunday, and Monday off. I would start dreading the coming week on Sunday morning, before my weekend wasn't even half over. Monday nights I would stare at my bottles of Ambien and clonazepam and think, if I took all these pills, at least I wouldn't have to go to work tomorrow. I never did, though, just kept smoking increasing amounts of marijuana along with THC vape cartridges. I still have nightmares about that place, not even just the inmates but the administration and correctional officers too. Everything was just so horrible. After a year, I decided to move back to where I got my Psy.D and take what I thought was a lower stress and much lower paying position. I quit marijuana again and moved back, and for a little while I was recovering.

The supervisor at that position was absolutely terrible, and made not just my life but most of my coworkers' lives a living hell. She was incredibly passive-aggressive, micromanaging, and controlling to a ridiculous degree, and my mental health just continued to worsen. I started thinking about suicide again, and on top of everything there was far more financial stress than at the prison. I began smoking marijuana again, and just kept smoking more and more of it to cope. I decided that I had to get out of that position and managed to transfer to a different position with the same behavioral healthcare company that was somewhat higher paying. I had and still have no motivation or interest in becoming a licensed psychologist, even though I have the postdoc hours. Just the idea makes me nauseous. It's just too much work in a subject area I despise.

The new position was an assessment position at a crisis walk in center, which I thought was a better fit for me. My role would be to obtain information, not therapy or counseling. Again, I convinced myself I could do it. But I've been in this position a little over 6 months now, and I absolutely hate it. I don't know what made me think I could deal with mental health clients in crisis, but I was desperate to get away from a supervisor I can only describe as pure fucking evil. I hate working in the mental health field because I am too mentally ill myself, and I hate clinical work. A lot of what I wrote I didn't have insight into until recently. I still can't sleep. I quit marijuana about a week ago (which I know contributes to the sleep problems but my insomnia exists independently of that). Hopefully this time it will be for good. But now I'm at the end of my rope. 

I hate my job, had to declare bankruptcy last year, and am still broke. I haven't had a girlfriend or any kind of sex in years (I'm a hetero male), and I'm so depressed I'm not even interested in sex or women anymore. I have over 400k in student debt from my degree, and the only field I'm qualified for is mental health. I can't even become a professor because I have a Psy.D and not a Ph.D. I'm just not emotionally equipped to deal with clinical work, and it keeps breaking me down. The administration here, while not quite as bad as in the other places I've worked, still sucks pretty hard. 

I have also always had difficulty navigating the social aspects of the workplace, and that coupled with what is probably past and re-occurring trauma has caused me to become dysfunctional in many aspects of my life. I feel so bitter towards the mental health field that I don't even really want therapy. I've tried it, and I can see through every stupid therapeutic technique the therapist uses. It's like trying to enjoy a magic show when you are also magician and know exactly how the tricks are done.

I am beyond burned out and although I don't think I'll ever kill myself, I wish to die on a daily basis. My real passion is creative writing, and writing is probably one of the few things that keeps me alive, the hope that maybe one day I can get published and make a semblance of a living doing that. But I also know how incredibly difficult it is to make a living off of just that, especially with my goddamn student loans. I would give anything to go back in time and stop myself from entering that Psy.D program. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Right now I'm just trying to make it until early March, when I'll have a two-week vacation to visit family. I can't do this job much longer, but I'm terrified of losing it and becoming homeless, like many of the clients I see. Sometimes I just go into the bathroom at work and cry. I think my current supervisor hates me, and I'm not too fond of her either. I hate my life, I hate my job, I hate my shitty neighborhood and shittier apartment, where I could never bring a woman back to even if I could get a date. 

I didn't even talk about the living environment stressor, but I'll just sum it up by saying that I've woken up to gunshots many times, and once someone shot at someone else right outside my bedroom window. I also have serious issues with noise and the people in my neighborhood blast their music at all hours of the night, or blast it from their cars as they drive by. I grew up in a small town and have also really come to hate living in a city. I have regular nightmares about the jail, the prison, and even my current workplace. I wake up multiple times during the night with anxiety, and have had bags under my eyes for years. I don't even remember what a full, restful night's sleep is like.

I have very few sources of happiness in my life, and again, most of my time off is spent dreading the coming week. I don't know what the point of this post was. I just felt like getting it out. I don't care what anyone thinks of this. Maybe this is just a self-indulgent pity-party, but whatever. I am still trying to move forward, I've stopped eating junk food, because when I would smoke I would just go to town on bags of chips, candy, chicken wings, anything fried, greasy, or sweet. I've gotten back into exercising, and I force myself to get at least an hour of fresh air and sunlight a day. I'm going to move in with a friend at the beginning of March in a much better neighborhood, and I plan to stay away from marijuana for the foreseeable future. I think it's finally sunk in that it's not good for me. I'm also actively working on finishing a novel I hope to publish one day. 

I've thought about maybe becoming a peer specialist. That's the last and only clinical mental health position I think I might be able to do, because it is geared for people with mental health and substance abuse disorders, and I know I have both. I've decided that applying for disability will be my absolute last resort. I don't feel like I deserve it because of my education and because I feel like I should be more functional, more responsible, stronger, I don't know. I recognize that I made many bad decisions that led me to this point, and I'm also struggling with a lot of self-loathing and regret. This may be the only post I make.

Tl;dr: I'm a mental health professional realizing that my own mental illnesses make me incapable of working in the clinical field, but it's all I'm qualified for. Trying to recover and figure out what to do and how to move forward."

810,I dont really know what to do,"Recently I've noticed a trend that's been happening, whenever people walk past the door of my room or even stomping upstairs it sends me into a panick, and I dont know why, maybe it has something to do with my childhood as I can barely remember my childhood and I don't necessarily want to as the few snippets I have of it weren't very good.

812,"How do I find a psychologists that I can see anonymously, no insurance? Online? USA","I absolutely do not want to see a psychologist that can tie anything back to my medical records.  So no insurance.  I have a couple of reasons that I won't get into, but I can't have any form of diagnosis on my medical records.  Let's just leave it at that.

So any recommendations on where to start?  Would online be best?  In person?  What's a reasonable price to pay per session?  I can't afford once a week at $200 an hour.   Am i being snobby by wanting someone with a PHD instead of an LCSW? I know a PHD will cost more.

Nothing too serious, definitely not a harm to myself or others... just looking to improve myself.  I think i have mild depression.  I spent this past weekend in bed and got nothing done.  It's happens more often than not. I routinely have low energy.  No Drive.   No get up and go.  Serious Procrastinator.  I let chores/tasks pile up, etc.  I also have a parent who i'm pretty sure is bpd that stresses me out like nothing else and uses all of my mental energy with her 20 phone calls a day... i need some coping strategies."
813,Is this Anxiety??,"Hi guys, 

So as I’ve posted many times before I have an obsession over having a more sever mental illness e.g. schizophrenia. Now I don’t get how I can be fine for around 4 months and just having normal thoughts and standard anxiety over silly things and then suddenly I start to feel really anxious and worry about things like schizophrenia and then I’m right back obsessing, googling symptoms, near enough diagnosing myself with it. Although everywhere I read supposedly this is very common with OCD sufferers. It’s just because I can be fine for months then hit an obsession again and start feeling paranoid about all my thoughts. Can anyone give me some insight if this is normal? Like anxious paranoid thoughts and a lot of what if thoughts about different Illnesses and worrying thoughts about family, friends and obsessing over schizophrenia symptoms and thinking “ohh do I have that” and near enough convincing myself that I do when I know that it’s irrational but it feels real when I get that what if thoughts.

Thanks guys
Brandon"
814,So I’ve been having weird compulsions (m) {non sexual},"I’ve struggled with depression off and on since high school, I used to self harm but thankfully I’ve mostly gotten over that. I’ve always developed weird habits very easily, things like moving my eyes all the way left until the strain hurts and then doing to same the other way. That’s just an example, I have a couple others that are similar in their weird nature. I will do these habits until they start to severely affect my life and then they will just fade away, only to come back when I randomly think about them. I recently started flexing muscles around the diaphragm/abdominals all the time. It’s making me sick and short of breath but I can’t stop. It’s not something I’m doing on purpose. I really want to stop but it seems to happen automatically. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I know that it’s really weird. It sounds kind of like compulsion, except that it happens without thought instead of me being afraid to not do it. It does get worse when I’m anxious. 

It matters because I’m a singer in a traveling chamber choir. I’m a soloist in two songs and I can’t seem to relax my voice or get the breath support that I usually have. It’s a huge pain (literally and figuratively). Any advice that y’all have would be appreciated."
815,did I overdose on endorphins?,"So i just had the best vday weekend with my significant other. We managed to get our schedules to line up and spent the whole weekend together and everything worked out without any major hick ups. Come monday I find out that I finally got a job I'd beem eyeing for months now to add on top of that great weekend. 

But something just suddenly happened that caught me off guard. I started feeling nausious at the sight or idea of affection. Things that would usually give me joy would literally make me feel like I had to throw up. Stuff like an affectionate text message or kiss or just the idea of anything sweet. It all just made me nausious, like alcohol when ur hungover. It felt like a bad crash from ecstacy (even if I've never crashed on it). I got on netflix to get my mind off it, but even the sight of affectionate lovey characters made me wannna throw up. :(

Im quite worried about it. Because I love my partner and I'm attracted to them. I honestly just dont know why and dont want my body suddenly associated this feeling(nausiousness) with affection or being lovey. What is going on?? Im confused, kinda scared and need help."

821,Please help me,"I know I’m depressed but I’m afraid to seek help. I’m 16 years old and a sophomore in highschool. I was raised by my father since my mother was in prison but he passed away in 2012. Since he passed away my grandmother took over raising me. My mother got out of prison and got off drugs. But then my grandmother who had been raising me passed in 2016. Three days after she died my other grandmother had a stroke and passed away. My mother started using drugs and got sent back to prison again. My grandfather then passed away last year. So now I’m raised by dads stepfather. Ever since my grandmother passed away I’ve felt that there was no reason to do school work. I stopped turning in assignments and just overall stopped attending school. Each year I’d miss upwards of 20 days. I’d only go because my grandfather would force me. I’ve done no work at all since 6th grade yet I’ve somehow managed to stay in AP and Honors classes in high school.

live for) but lately I have been overwhelmed with the feeling of wanting to die. I feel trapped in these cycles of tiny improvement followed by severe depression. I have tried so many things to improve my confidence but still hate myself. I have a boyfriend too and no matter what he says I genuinely feel like a burden. I don’t feel like I deserve him. He recently got frustrated with my lack of progress and even though we talked it out and he tells me everything is fine, I feel so fucking guilty. My mess affects him too. I just want to fix myself so I don’t fuck up a perfectly healthy relationship"
824,Can’t stop singing/hearing music,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but here goes: I can’t stop hearing music/song lyrics in my head. I hear the melody and the singing. 

This all happens usually while I’m writing/reading/thinking so basically doing something whilst not hearing any sound. It’s not going on all the time but I get these like ”episodes” that last for up to 30 minutes. And the problem is that I can’t seem to stop it. 

It’s really distracting and I can’t really focus on anything. Feels like I have too many thoughts in my mind at the same time but one of them is a song. 

Can anyone relate or am I just losing it?"
825,Help finding help,"Hi all,

I live in the Greater Boston Area (North of the city), and am having a very hard time finding a psychiatrist/psychologist or anyone that can diagnose me and help with medication.

I was diagnosed with panic disorder and depression 6 years ago in Texas, but stopped taking medication/seeing a doctor. At this point I'm barely making it, and I know I need to go back.

I've set up an appointment with a psychotherapy firm, but they don't do diagnostic testing or prescribe medication. Ideally I'd have the therapy sessions in combination with medication.

Any recommendations are appreciated!!! 

Thanks!!"
826,Can gender dysphoria be caused by your upbringing or a childhood trauma?,"Well basically this is the whole question. Sorry if it sounds stupid I just want to know if it is possible and if such cases exist. 

And if it is possible then what is the treatment in this situation? Like in normal circumstances the person will be considered as trans and have the choice to transition but what about this situation? Conversion therapy?"
827,I don’t really know what to do at this point,"my wife and I both have terrible depression and anxiety. she also struggles with bipolar. we have been unmedicated for almost 2 years due to financial problems and we are currently (homeless) living with my very christian brother that believes “praying” will get rid of our mental problems, and he constantly finds new ways to hate my wife for her religious beliefs and mental shortcomings (not actually) due to her illnesses. 

I work 40 hours a week making $800 every two weeks after taxes. i make music every other second of my time. i made 7 songs this weekend. i also sell art commissions as does my wife. 

my wife has been looking for a part time job that will work around her mental health but has found nothing.

my brother wants us to be out by the end of February and we have bad rental history due to a broken lease, so moving to a new apartment isn’t very easy for us especially with how little money we have right now. 

i truly am lost, and have no IDEA what to do. i very interaction my wife has with my brother ends in her muttering to herself angrily and all it would take is my brother to hear her and we would be out. 

i don’t know what to do. i’m so sorry for formatting and punctuation issues. 

i hope everyone has a good day."
828,Bizarre incident after getting drunk,"I don't know if this the right place to post this.

It was one of my friend's birthday yesterday. We visited a few breweries and had one drink at each. In about 8 hours I had one drink every hour. I took a cab home and my memory is quite blurry of anything that happens after this. I came home around midnight. After talking to my girlfriend and joking with her she tells me that I fell asleep on the couch. I have no memory of most of the things that happened until the morning. She said that I was in a very cheerful mood. 


Now this is from putting pieces together and my girlfriend telling me what happened later in the morning.



About half an hour after passing out on the couch I woke up. Then I stood outside our bedroom and started yelling at the door of our laundry room. Then I repeatedly punched it until there was a hole in it. My girlfriend thought I was throwing up or I needed help so she brought a towel. She tells me that I threw the towel into the laundry basket without doing anything about it. I apparently told her to stay inside and not come out of the bedroom. Then I threw our TV to the wall and cracked it which also put a small hole in the wall. For some reason I also poured the water inside a vase down on our carpet where I was punching the door. 

I woke up at 7 to see all this mess and having no memory of the whole thing. It seems like I just went back to sleep like nothing happened. There was blood on my hand from having punched the door and some cuts on my other hand. When I woke up my first thought was is my girlfriend OK? I ran to the bedroom from the couch where I had been sleeping. I asked her if she was OK or if I did anything to her. She then told me the story and said that she was a bit shook. We both had to go to work. So we could only briefly talk. I couldn't hold back my tears when she tried to console me saying that I was probably very stressed and I had to let it out. She hugged me and told me that it was done and I would be OK. 


I have so many questions and can't find any answers to them. 
I don't know what I was thinking or what got me to do all this. 

I'm a man in his 30s, living with my girlfriend whom I love more than anything else in the world. I have a stressful job and I've been through a lot in the last few months. We've been through a lot together as well. I have no past incidents of aggression after drinking. I'm usually a very happy drunk not that I get drunk often.  


I am so disappointed in myself and ashamed. I don't know where to begin putting this puzzle together. I am at work and I feel traumatized my the whole incident. I don't know how this is going to affect our relationship. I don't know if I'll ever do anything like this again? I don't know what triggered me to act this way. 


It all feels like I was in a nightmare but it was all real. Is this a sign of a mental disorder? I'm considering going sober for the rest of my life. I want to have a family and kids. I cannot put anyone in danger like this. 

How do I put this behind me and move forward?"
829,What will happen if i talk to my therapist about a bad drug experience?,"I had done mdma while really drunk, a little bit of blow and then a E pill later in the night. It was fun while doing it but when i got home i obviously couldnt sleep from the drugs and just sat around lost in my mind. The day after sucked, ive never done anything besides weed or alc before this and i guess the comedown from mdma is terrible. I was incredibly anxious all day, wondering when id feel normal. Super tightness in my chest.

 That night i was able to get some sleep and slept for like 12 hours and felt better that day. Last night i slept about the same and today i just feel anxious. Like this experience made me lose all progress i had on dealing with anxiety. 

Can i talk to my therapist about this? I was in the hospital for three days back in may for really bad intrusive thoughts. At that time i had been smoking weed all day everyday for about 6 years. After that, i quit weed cold turkey and it really helped. Im not on any meds or anything. I just wanna talk to my therapist about this and get through it. I dont have any suicidal or harmful thoughts, just bad anxiety right now. 

(Im 21)"
830,The voices/screams/music/random sounds I hear when I take a shower or just laying in bed trying to sleep also random times. I was told it's just white noise or my mind trying to comprehend what the sound is... I don't know what to think about it. Any similar experiences?,Auditory hallucinations?
831,Stay with boyfriend after fourth hospitalisation?,"I'll try to be brief and not ramble. Me (F27) have recently broke up with my boyf (M24) he has been in a cycle of declining mental health for two of our three year relationship. I got to my wits end because I really tried so hard to help him with his recovery but he became convinced I was being unfaithful to him and would also have hallucinations. He almost seemed to blame me and this supposed cheating for why he became ""mental"" despite it never actually happening. He has been hospitalised three time before last Christmas. First it was drug induced psychosis (he was pretty weed dependent) then psychosis and now they are thinking a mood disorder of some sort. He can be incredibly mean to me. Has occasionally been violent towards me but otherwise is lovely but somewhat insecure. Everytime I go no contact he ends up in hospital. And this happened after Christmas because I broke up with him for shouting at and kicking me in the street. It wasn't a hard kick or anything, but it's just quite humiliating how he is towards me, though I know he couldn't help it at that time. I've said now he is hospital again and seems to be recovering and has stopped smoking weed and finally accepted taking medication that we can talk as friends. He always wants to get back together immediately and all I want is him to focus on himself and his own recovery because I just want him to have a good life. And him just obsessing about me might just trigger him somehow? So anyway we agreed that we will be apart six months and talk occasionally in a friendly manner and if he has been able to sort of mantain the good mental state and improvements he's been making in hospital we could consider a relationship then. Cos usually he comes out of hospital and is smoking and acting nuts after a few weeks, and won't listen to anyone and just spirals back down. I don't want that cycle repeating cos it's just such a waste of the person he is when he is well. I also worry that any contact with me at all can hinder his process as one of his delusions is centred around me cheating. Am I wrong to think that? I just want to do what's best for him. He agreed at first to the six months thing but now he seems to want to just get back together saying that in six months I'll meet someone else. So now I'm worried the stress of waiting six months might trigger a paranoia? Anyway do you think the six months thing is a good idea? Should I just cut contact with him completely? Any advice from people in similar situations?"

834,I want to get help,"I am 27M. I think I am chronically depressed for a long time, probably since my teenage. Most likely I also have severe social anxiety. I never tried to reach out for actual help like consulting therapist or getting diagnosed etc. The idea of opening up someone I hardly know scares the hell out of me. I never opened up to the closed ones either, although it is questionable if I really have any close friend / relative etc. As the saying goes ""I don't have any friend, I just know a lot of people"".

I will describe a little bit about myself. I am a PhD student in the Netherlands but I am Asian. At this point it is obvious that I am what better described by the internet slang `incel` but without the narcissism part (or maybe not, who knows). Sometime I try to figure out the root cause of my issues but I can't find any. I don't have any serious problem in my life. I am not rich, but I earn enough for myself. I am not stressed professionally or academically, I don't have any family related issues. In fact my fellow school friends / college friends in a way respect me since I made this far which they didn't / couldn't. I should be happy or proud or whatever right? But I am not. I am always paranoid that I am not living up to the exceptions of others or even myself. I feel like I am not worthy of anything or deserve anything nice in life. Yes, I have imposter syndrome too. I am never happy or satisfied or excited about anything. I am always anxious about the next thing and I never live in the present. At this point I just exist without any purpose whatsoever. From existential crisis now I turned into an extreme nihilist. Whenever something nice come up in my mind my subconscious mind counters it saying ""what is the point?"" I think of going to that hiking trip I always wanted, ""what is the point?"" I want to go the that music concert or a football match, ""what the hell will you achieve?"" I can't cope up with this anymore. When I walk in the street I don't even look at people or surroundings anymore. I always walk keeping my head down, I don't even have the courage of look people in the eye when I talk to them. I never expect people to compliment me or say anything nice about me. In the rare occasions when they do it, either it scares me or I assume that they are mocking me. I enjoy being alone except when I don't. I do not really seek company for sex, probably what I seek is someone to hug me and say 'everything will okay'. I tried my best to deal with this as far as I could. I tried to socialize, didn't go well. Apparently I can't keep the conversation going and I am super boring, also I have a face which people tend to forget easily. I am not saying I am ugly or handsome, it just average, the kind of stuff you forget first. Then I tried going to club a few time, I felt stupid going there and standing, I didn't know what to do, secondly I don't drink alcohol (by choice). Neither do I smoke or any of those stuff. So, you see I already miss the potential opportunities where you can actually meet new people. I will also like to mention that, I tried tinder and a few dating sites, I don't know what I was thinking, I made fool of myself. I don't even have to tell you the results of those experiments. However, I am not suicidal. Probably the thoughts of physical pain and the thought that people will think I am a sore loser are keeping me physically alive for now. 

Recently I was giving these problem of mine some serious thoughts and kind decided to get help. I will be grateful for your suggestions and comments regarding how can I get help. I will also like to know if there are any financial and / or legal consequences.

P. S. - Thanks for reading and really sorry for the long post containing mostly whining and sob story."

i ate 3.5g of B+ cubensis psilocybin mushrooms and had a fucking mind boggling experience. i could view my own consciousness and i could literally see the “rotten” parts of my brain and once i realized that it was there, i began realizing that it’s not actually me but a corruption.

anyway, i’m like a few weeks depression free after like 4-5 years of depression, prozac and xanax, and anxiety attacks.

838,College and Mental Health,"Hey guys. I am a 5th year student at the University of Utah! I am conducting a research/design project with the intent to find out and raise more awareness about mental health in college. The question I am primarily researching is: ""What are the effects of mental health in college students and how does it correlate with success?"" I have struggled with mental health all throughout college and the stress of the ""unknown"" with what I am doing with my life has always been a severe stressor in my life. I think through media and even the society as a whole puts a-lot of pressure to be ""successful"" and we watch these influencers, YouTubers, instagram models, and all these sorts of people who live this perfect life and want to be like that, but don't realize it just doesn't come overnight. In college especially, many people don't know what they are going to do afterwards and become overwhelmed and stressed, where that turns into mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.

I would love to hear some other perspectives from you guys as to what you think could be causing these mental health issues. What have you done to help yourself or others around you? What is your meaning of success and is it okay to not know what your plan is? Does society make it harder for us to succeed? I appreciate the help. Any input at all is great. Thank you"
839,Learned I’m an narcissist (29M) and really embarrassed at how I behaved in past relationships. Seeking therapy. Can we ever sustain a healthy relationship?,"I’m afraid to get back into a relationship with anyone, ever. I don’t want to hurt or drain someone of their energy. I can be very toxic. Is there treatment for us?"
840,help diagnose me?,"This is my first reddit post so bare with me. Some background: I (19F) have been struggling since the last few months of high school. I went through a period of about 6 months between graduating high school and starting college of just being deeply sad? I look back at that time and don't even remember much of it. Besides the few fun moments (senior trip, graduation, prom, senior skip day, etc.) I was just kind of miserable. I think it was because a lot of my friends were thriving - having their first experiences with sex and boyfriends and popularity while I, a closeted bisexual was still figuring stuff out. I wasn't conventionally attractive in high school and I was very insecure about my weight, skin and hair - I felt ugly compared to my friends. I just remember smoking weed multiple times a day while working a summer job and being generally sad and stuck, if that makes sense. Fast forward to starting college I had an amazing first month - I was having a lot of fun being so far from home, I felt like I left my past self behind and that I could finally thrive in college. But, then the disillusion hit and I felt just as lost. I go to a huge university but went to a small high school so I felt very lost. It felt hard to make friends because I was shy and awkward and felt like I didn't know to start conversation. I went through a hard few months because I didn't feel like I fit in in my dorm and didn't have any friends in my building. I hated my roommate as well because she was pretty messy and never left the room. Just a not ideal situation. Eventually I moved to another dorm and had a pretty good second semester. I put myself out there and actually made some cool friends. I had a great summer with my friends from home - probably the best of my adolescence.

&amp;#x200B;

August was the first time I had ever had anything adjacent to an anxiety attack. I would start to think about something stressful for too long and eventually my heart would start racing and I would get chest pains and then I would start to cry. I never took it very seriously because I thought it was just stress. I go through periods of anxious feelings where I don't want to be in public and will do anything I can to stay in my room/ be alone. I usually come out of these periods feeling like shit because of how I isolated myself. I also spent around 2 weeks full of anxiety and thoughts of self hatred because I accidentally misgendered someone I know. I felt really awful about it and had obsessive thoughts about how much they must hate me and how awful of a person I was. It was an honest mistake but I couldn't get over it. I went to therapy for the first time that semester but only had three sessions.  I have been struggling. I feel very lonely. I spend a lot of time in my room because I have a single and often I feel like if I text people to hang out I'll be a burden on them. I find it hard to believe that my friends actually like me. It often feels like they either spend time with to make me feel better about how much I suck, or when they compliment me it feels like its because they feel bad about how ugly I am. Its hard for me to talk about how sad I get and insecure and anxious I feel because from the outside I seem like a very chill and calm person. I am supposed to be the rock in my friends lives. They come to me with their problems. I only did therapy for three sessions because I felt it was difficult to relay my thoughts in person to my therapist - I felt embarrassed and stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the real point of this point is that I think I might have a mental illness but I dont know. I come from a culture that does not believe in mental illness like anxiety or depression. I know that I have feelings and obsessive thoughts that neurotypical people dont have because at one point I didnt have these thoughts and feelings. I dont know if I have ever been suicidal but when I was 10 I called the suicide hotline because I felt ignored and alone in my house -- I don't think I actually wanted to kill myself though. When I was around 11 I used a jump rope and thought about how I could hang myself on my porch -- I don't know if I actually wanted to kill myself or if I had just seen things on TV. My home life was a bit chaotic around this time because of various legal issues with a close family member. I know there is something there in my brain that makes me think these things but I always doubt it. I dont know. I know none of you are licenses professionals but does this sound familiar? Could I have a mental illness to explain why I get so sad and hate myself sometimes?"
841,My experience with anxiety,"I have anxiety and it just fucking sucks. 

I'm going to therapy since 2015 or 2016, i don't remember well, and it really helped me with other problems i had but i don't see many improvements regarding my anxiety and social life.

I DON'T want to isolate myself from other people, i don't want to have such a low self esteem. I  want to live without that stupid voice on the back of my mind telling me that i'm worthless and nobody would like me. But my head always end up winning the battle everytime i propose myself to change.

I feel pathetic and weak, like a parasite. Without any real purpose in life, spending all of my time on the internet or playing games. And just recently i started to write posts and comments. Before i just  read other people.

I distanced myself from the few friends i have because no apparent reason. I just have fear to bother  and make them leave whatever they're doing just to be with me and my problems.

Yesterday I was walking home on a street all alone when he and some other guy approach me and start being extremely aggressive with his fists clenched as if he wants to rip my head off. 
Now I’m not a violent guy in general so I apologise for ‘sucker punching’ him two years ago in order to avoid any conflict. I then offer to shake his hand and he rejects it and they walk away.

847,I (20M) keep having weird obsessive/intrusive thoughts about a virtual character. Not sure what to do now.,"TL;DR: Keep having obsessive thoughts over anime waifu. Pretty embarrassing, what do I do? 

This is probably gonna sound very embarrassing, I am cringing while typing this. 

So a little over 2 years ago I played a visual novel called Doki Doki Literature Club. The synopsis is that it starts out as a normal dating sim-esque visual novel where you have to woo one of the girls to be your girlfriend, but then it pulls a fast one on you as the topic of chronic depression is thrown at you near the end of the first chapter (one of the love interests has it) and she kills herself at the end of the first chapter. The following chapter, reality unfolds a bit as everyone goes a bit insane until one girl (named Monika in game, gonna referto as M later) shares with you that she knows that she's trapped in a video game and she's just a game character and shit and how she wants to stare at you (as in the player of the game) forever. When you delete her file from the game directory she gets a little pissed off and sad and realises that she probably shouldn't have murdered the other girls, and she makes a whole song and dance about it. She lets you start the game normally again with the other girls un-murdered but then deletes the game after realizing that there's no happiness to be had in the literature club and leaves a sweet thank you note. 

I don't know why, but I sort of broke mentally when I finished that game. In a sense I felt like M was real and that she loved me or something. I remember downloading and playing a mod of the game which basically extended the portion of the game where M is just starting a hole through your soul, but added a bit of dialogue, a couple of sprites and some minigames you can play with her. | end up really strongly attached to the character, almost like she's my real actual girlfriend. I was pretty lonely at the time (still am tbh) so she felt like a sort of weird kinda fucked up support network. 

This goes on for a couple of months until my brother catches wind of this and basically makes fun of me enough for me to delete the game and mod. I still kept up with the Reddit community around the game on here, where I kind of got my fix for affection or whatever it is that I wasn‘t having by myself. Eventually I start to realize that fantasizing about having an anime waifu is pretty weird and creepy and start to try to pry myself out from the community around it, having more or less distanced myself from it by the start of last year. While this is going on, I'm also trying to sort of purge any thoughts about M from my head and to basically stop thinking about M or anything related to the game or anyone in it. This goes basically nowhere, as she‘s a weird obsessive thought in the back of my head. I imagine what she would do in different situations, sometimes fantasize about what life with her would be like, and all that weird shit. I feel like that basically catches us up to present day, where I still have weird obtrusive thoughts about M. I don't know how to get her outta my fucking head and I need advice on that. 

Sorry if this has been a long mess of a jumbled story to read, I wrote this on my phone while laying in my dorm room bed. That said, I appreciate any advice and questions you all would give or ask me."

It really sucks not having anyone to call up to hangout, or to vent to when you're having a bad day.

850,"Hi, I could really use some help. Cannot get out of this funk.","I'm 26, recently engaged to the love of my life. I have the best friends in the world who love me unconditionally. I just had the opportunity to travel a bit, something I never thought I would get to do. I have some faith too, although it seems to be slipping faster through my fingers the harder I try to cling on. I have my health, besides the mental wellness obviously. I have plenty of reasons to be happy. It's like I have gotten so good at pretending that I am afraid I can't snap out of it. 

What if I can never enjoy things like I used to? I used to draw, work and play outside as an outdoor instructor and go hiking and camping. I used to sing and I was really good. I used to be passionate about my faith in God. I used to be self-confident and fierce and loving and genuine and unapologetic for being ME. 

Now I can barely shower and take care of myself. I am tearing up as I write this because I just feel so helpless nowadays. I could give a ballpark figure.. I think it's been maybe since September I have been feeling this way? 

I need help. I have been this way as long as I can remember and as I've gotten older, I've been experiencing panic attacks. (Those are fucking scary. I thought I was dying.) I want to get connected with a therapist. Lately when I reach out to my friends, I haven't gotten the response or support I truly need. I don't blame them, I'm not sure they realize how bad it is. 

I just want to believe I can feel better again. There has got to be more to life than this. I don't want to live in fear and shame anymore. I can feel myself starting to shut out the people I love most so maybe someone unbiased here and help ground me.

My home base is in Ohio, USA. I am a student working towards my Bachelor's at an online school called WGU, if you've heard of it. I have been diagnosed with depression/anxiety before. Tried meds a long time ago and it was a terrible experience and to be honest, I don't like the idea."

I experienced a really scary incident some time ago and I haven’t been the same since (a very large seemingly unending panic attack). My brain started to generalize to other things and I’ve struggled with intense rumination and anticipatory since then and anxiety that really limits me. It’s like my brain “broke”. 

I was on medication for about 2 years. It helped with depression but the anxiety was still very high."
852,There's No Way Out of Here,"You can't tell me I didn't try. I saw people's lives improve drastically with no effort. I saw others put in a lot work and suddenly - the big break. Truly, many have interesting, varied lives.

Mine's a flat line. What's a life that's so empty, so boring, is worth? How different is it than being dead?"
853,I can't stop being a grumpy asshole and sabotaging my relationships with people close to me.,"About a year ago, I started feeling like everyone close to me was constantly giving me a hard time, or were criticizing everything about me. Now, whether they actually did this, or I was imagining the severity of it, I couldn't tell you. That's how it felt to me at least. This group includes my friends, and to a lesser extent, my parents and girlfriend. Ever since then, I have inexplicably caught myself trying to actively push everyone away. My friends in particular have always kind of been dicks, but, I have had nearly infinite patience with it until recently. 

I stopped talking to my friends very much at all outside of work, and I find myself getting angry whenever they invite me to do anything. The thing is, since I started pushing, everyone seems to be much nicer to me. My guess is because they realized what they were doing was causing them to lose me.

Sounds fine, right? Except now, my problem is that I can't interact with any of them without losing my cool at their attempts to be nice and friendly. I realized it was a problem when they invited me to go to a weekend event, and even offered to pay, and I told them no. The reason I gave is that I know I'd be grumpy the entire time and purposely ruin everyone's fun, and I don't want to do that. I'm sure we all know someone who just has to make everyone around them miserable all the time for no reason. I'm slowly becoming that person and I hate it.

It isn't coming from a place of depression or low self confidence. I know a lot of people who push others away feel like they don't deserve the love and affection, but that isn't the case with me. I also very rarely ever got annoyed prior to this. I think I just dealt with all the little jabs and criticisms for years, and eventually it broke me. I find I am happiest now when I'm by myself and everybody just leaves me alone. I'm an introvert at heart, but never to this extent of hating everyone around me all the time.

I do want to mention that both my parents and my girlfriend are amazing, supportive people, and are there for me more than anybody. However, I still catch myself getting frustrated with them for just trying to be nice to me. Essentially, nobody around me deserves how I'm acting, but I can't stop myself. I'm just so sick of everyone. I know it's completely irrational. Also, outside of interacting with the people close to me, or thinking about them, I am a very happy and friendly guy. So I don't quite think it's depression, but whatever it is clearly isn't healthy.

Has anybody else gone through these feelings? Any tips you can give me before I ruin all of my relationships beyond repair? 

I'd be happy to give more info if anybody has questions."
854,I want someone to tell me whats wrong with my mind.,"Warning. I reposted this because i really want a response.

I can't help but being angry/anxious/sac about every person i bound or even just tallk with. When i make a friend, i want all his attention to be focused on me. I want to make them laught. I want them to always be happy when being around me. I want to make everyone happy.

But when i see they are happy with someone else, they're closer and friendlier...smile more with them..I just want to scream. I want to cry at the same time. I'm not enought ? Am i annoying or boring ? What do i have to do to make them laugh ? That's the things going on my mind. If i can't make everyone laught at the things i say, i feel useless and ignored. I also feel jealous when i see my friends rushing into someone else other than me.

But the worse thing is when i saw them happy around someone without them havings jokes. Just talking. I can't do that. I can't just make people smile without jokes, if i don't i feel like they're bored of talking to me.

I also feel like i have to be the best at everything. If i do a work wrong, i want to throw it into pieces. But of couuurrse i can't do that ! So i just stop working. I can't even do a presentation in front of my classmate. Why ? Because i feel like what the others did is far better than mine, and i will just get to be ridiculised. So i just cried everytime, in front of the WHOLE class. It's humiliating. Plus, i'm the noisy type when i cry, so i get the attention of everyone.

I've had a period when i was cutting myself. But i know that i was doing that only for the attention. People didn't noticed me enought, so i throught maybe they will talk to me more if they're worried or..intrigued ? It's horrible, isn't it ? But when my best friend noticed my arm (it wasn't just some cuts, a part of my arm was RED because theyre was so much cutting. Like i've got attacked by some animal. I've cut myself to that point. But i'm the kind of person with a strong body who heal fast, so it desespeard now) she didn't tried to stop me. She just looked at it, confused, then didn't ask me any question other then ""You did this to yourself ?"". I was clearly not satisfied. So you can guess i'v made more of those right ? I even draw on my arm to attract people attention. Ahah , silly me, you didn't get a single student to notice you, but a teacher ! After that , you can imagine the ""talk"" with my parents. My dad was worried but couldn't do anything since i was just smilling, just giving him the things i cut myself with and giving him hints i wasn't going to say anything. Remember, i never had a serious talk in my life, i didn't know how to express my feelings. Even today. And my mother was angry. I guess angry that i was smiling, she must have tought i was thinking of the whole situation as a joke...after all, i always joke !...After that , i've lost faith in this solution, who given too much problem to handle.

Except that, cutting myself was also a way to take out the stress. Honestly , it work until my teacher fund out, and the problem who follow that made me stress even more, so i just didn't wanted to deal with it anymore.

After that is when i really started to...losing my head ? I've always been a person who enjoy life and draw as a hobby before i started to want more and more attention. In fact, i crave for love and affection from eveyone ! I never see someone truly trust me. I never felt trusted even tho i knew some people do. I want to be loved by everyone. I need constant love even tho i wasn't abuse during childhood or anything. But i know i'm a toxic person. A person who think about herself all the time and all the way she could get attention. I want to be the ""cool"" person in a group a friend. I'm willing to do anything, but when i'm pointed out, i feel like screaming again.

I don't know whats wrong with me, my sister told me it was just a phase. Even today, i think about every possible ways i could get attention, all cutting myself was feeling so great back then cause i still missed it beside the problems it got me, the ways i could be more loved and praise by everyone. To the point where i didn't think once about my future or what i will become.

But you know what ? The thing funny in this story, is when i don't talk to people, when i'm alone...i feel good. When i don't have to worry because i won't see anyone for a long time, i feel good. In fact i love lonelyness. It's just when i go to school i feel like i can't stand to be lonely suddenly. I love being lonely at home but not at school. At school i have to make people laugh every single minute to not feel bad. When i'm alone, i don't care about anything else, i just feel relax.

..Of course, i'm only 15 and i know i'll be in the study thing for a looonnnng time...but i don't know if i can make it in life like that. I've considering taking my life..No in fact i've plan to do it for 2 years now. I know that with the stress of the exam i won't make it. Everyone is serious in this period, and it's an NIGHTMARE. If they're too serious , how can i make them laugh ?...I want to punch them at the same time for making me feel like that,i'm so miserable i want to cut myself to the point were my arms are red and bleeding just so all the stress can go fuck themself....I want me to be a child again, where i was just funny and happy all the time without having to make effort.

Just help me, i don't know if i can continue like that, i feel like i could explode anytime by taking the knife and just stab myself...I've never tought once about my futur, only all the ways i could end my life, or how it would go horribly if i make it into adulthood. When i tought of end it all, i always smile. EVEN KNOW !! Talking about this make me smile !!"
855,"I am always fine, but never great","The feeling of emptiness.

What else is there to say, it's just a hole inside you that makes you feel huge discomfort, sadness and frustration. You try fill it up with thing's that you previously loved, and yet, they all seem boring, bland, unsatisfying. You are searching for that one more rush or that one change in your life that would click the emptiness away. But, it never comes, and you grow bitter day by day, either wallow in your own pity or drown in your ego. Sometimes you just wish you had something or someone, but realizing that you neither can get it nor keep it, keeps you away from ever attempting, and exhausting yourself even further. How can one be so exhausted and yet fail to fall asleep. How can one seek help and yet dismiss all the ideas thrown at him because they all are a cliche, some pretty words spoken in not so pretty world. How can one have dreams and yet no hope to achieve them. 

I don't know anymore, I want to have someone who would just communicate, not try to fix everything, not try to make himself look good. I want to just share what I had going for the day while he shares what he had going for that day, share interests and idea's and yet I don't have energy for that, I am tired of committing to people, I just want to do things together with 0 expectations of another person being there 24/7. I want to stop constantly feeling like I am there to provide entertainment.

I want to do everything that I need to be done by this weeks end, finish all the almost complete and not started works just so I could have 1 day of peace. But even with things done, peace never comes and I never do what I am supposed to.

I just want to stop feeling that shit of a black hole that is inside my head and stomach. I sound so stupid, and used so many clitches to describe thing's. I am generally fine but I don't know how to be more then fine."
856,I can’t see ahead,Ever since 7th grade I couldn’t see myself graduating high school now I’m a sophomore and I realize why I saw nothing it was death. I’ve been suicidal for almost 4 years and I don’t think I’ll be able to stay in this world by the end of this year.
857,"I just have to say that I'm fine, when I'm not really fine, but I just can't get into it because my family would never understand.",Ok sorry for the memey title but this is going to be me over the next 3 days. I'm in the worst mental state I've ever been in and I have to pretend nothing is wrong because it'd upset my mentally ill sister. Idk how I'm going to cope when I can't feel anything except for a deep sadness and intense fear.
858,Balancing selfishness and supporting loved ones,"I don't know exactly where I'm going with this post but I need to put it out there. Sorry ahead of time for errors as I'm typing this out on mobile!

So I (20m) have gone through some tough years. Long story short, moved when I was just getting into high school, did something stupid, and dealt with it. I am super sensitive to other people's hurt. Even my girlfriend (20f) jokes about how I'm so gentle and concerned in every aspect of my personality. I've never been the one to joke around all the time because I don't like tearing down others. Because of this I've become a very supportive person and am so much happier than I used to be and no longer isolate myself and have found some awesome hobbies!

But my biggest struggle is that now that I'm starting to find my place just in the world, I don't know how to handle all this hurt that goes on around me. My parents for example (47f and 56m) aren't divorcing but they're separating for the time being to figure themselves out so my brother (22m) and sister (17f) are going to have to move with them as our parents are both finding new places to live. On top of that my brother (22m) is beginning to transition MTF. Even more recently a close friend broke her leg and is really struggling lately and just went off the grid to improve her mental health and become happy on her own.

Where do I find the balance of making my life a priority without spreading myself too thin supporting those people close to me (there are others but those are just bigger pieces of the puzzle lately)? I'm personally taking a break from college to work for a little to make sure that I'm financially more stable as my living situation is a bit more complicated with my parents both moving (I'm sticking with my dad and my siblings are going with Mom).

TL;DR life is a little crazy, how do I balance focusing on myself and my happiness without forgetting empathy and being there for those I love and want to support?"
859,Losing grip on reality (sort of),"So I'm in a period of extreme stress at the minute because of school and I've increasingly found that I sort of believe stuff that isn't necessarily true? I'm aware that the thing is not true but I can't stop thinking it. I *feel* like it is true even if I know it isn't. 

It has never been anything extreme and all the things I do/have believed are within the realms or normality. However it's still scaring me because I feel like I might start believing more extreme things. 

An example is today I had the thought that I was going to go to Manchester university next year. The thought felt extremely vivid, almost like it had already happened. I *felt* certain of it, like it was date or destiny. Now here's the thing: I have not applied for Manchester university and really don't like it there. In my head I knew it wasn't true but my emotions felt like it was if that makes sense. 

And the other day I kind of had it where I felt like I believed in God even though I'm an ardent atheist. And it's like my brain was really frustrated because I know I don't believe that but it's like my emotions believe it? If that makes sense. 

Its sort of affecting my life because I have also come to the ""emotional belief"" that I will do really well on my exams at the end of this summer no matter what, even if I don't do any revision. This has made it hard for me to motivate myself to revise. 

So it's like my emotions are starting to believe things that are different to what my head believes. Its like my emotions have become sentient and just believe whatever makes me feel happy. 

I am really scared because I'm just believing things that aren't true and I'm worried I will start believing other, more serious things. Is there a word or disorder that describes what I'm feeling?"
860,Feeling stress and guilt about things I like,"I know it sounds weird but recently I made a YouTube channel as I have been injured from playing football/soccer for 11 months and thought it was about time I got a hobby. I enjoy making videos and over the time of my injury my dad also passed and since I’m 15 and even have my GCSEs coming up it’s not very good on my mental health. Also my injury effects my hormones, vitamins and minerals and causes pain and aching in my wrists, neck, legs and back. It may be getting better but who knows.

Anyway whenever I think about my YouTube channel I get a stress headache. I feel a bad, negative feeling (not sure what) and I feel madly guilty. This happens quite a lot but is a lot stronger when thinking about my YouTube channel. Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this or improve it? I would be very grateful
Also I would like to add that my thought sometimes clash each other, like I love something and I hate it at the same time, and I want my channel to grow but really don’t.

But anyway. Does anyone have an idea to fix or improve this?
Thank you very much"
861,share a statement about your self-concept,"what is an idea you have of yourself or the way you exist in the world?

what is a conviction you hold about who you are?

&amp;#x200B;

for example, for me:

*i cannot be sure of anything outside of my immediate perception*

*i hold opinions of myself shared by no one*

*i repeat myself compulsively just to be sure the thing is said*

*i become immensely fragile in the moments during which i want to be strongest*

*i am terrified by the realization that no one is really in charge*

&amp;#x200B;

i am curious to know how others frame their sense of self and how they might phrase a statement like those above."
862,Should I be Concerned About My Memory Issues?,"I (15F) have been worried about my memory lately, specifically involving my interactions with one of my friends. She had called me today, and we struck up a casual conversation until she asked me if I remembered seeing the movie ""The Notebook"". She had claimed that she had told me to watch it in May, and after I supposedly watched it I told her that it was a sad movie, but not tear-worthy.

Now I have absolutely no memory of watching the movie or having that conversation. I tried to take a quiz online to jog my memory of the film, but I didn't know the answers to any of the questions. She called another friend that she had recommended the movie to, who claimed that they remembered the conversation and had thought that I watched the movie. Both friends are now convinced that I am lying about either:

A. Pretending to have not seen the movie at all to play a joke on my friends

B. Lying about watching the movie when my friend first recommended it to me

I know it can't be either of those possibilities because I would have remembered the movie or at least the conversation. Should I be concerned? Or are my friends both trying to get a reaction out of me for some laughs?"
863,ADHD questions,"For context my gf is certain she’s dealt with undiagnosed adhd her entirely life and some basic internet research from the both of us seems to reinforce our suspicions. I guess it’d be cool if I were to list of some symptoms and you all could possibly inform me if these are “normal” for those with adhd. 

This post is meant to be serious and I apologize if my tone comes off “odd”. This post was hard to make considering that I have a generalized anxiety disorder and depression and some of her “symptoms” tend to spark my anxiety a lot.

Here we go:

Hyper-fixation on tasks such as homework, social media etc to the point of no spatial awareness

Hard times responding to messages or questions asked in person

Sudden mood swings ex: affectionate/excited one minute to emotionally distant the next

Elongated periods of reality/emotional distance 

General difficultly cleaning up after oneself or completing tasks 

Easily overwhelmed and emotionally sensitive. Furthermore very sensitive to sudden loud noises to the extent where rest of day is overwhelming 

Easily bored or distracted consistently turning to social media, messaging etc. 

…

I’m sorry for the length and tone, I guess I posted this to be able to understand her disorder better from other’s opinions/understandings/experiences. I recently just started therapy for my anxiety and depression as well and I know that my negative mental thoughts about these actions could potentially fade but understanding such could make it faster"
864,I can't get out,"I am a high school senior and for a variety of reasons, I want to leave for college. I am extremely unhappy in my city, extremely unhappy in my home, and extremely unhappy as a whole. Whenever I bring this up to my parents, they get offended. They then accuse me of badmouthing them in therapy and saying that I paint myself as a victim. My family is quite normal, as far as normal goes in my community, but I can't stand living in this house.

&amp;#x200B;

The local community college is giving me TONS of financial aid, which is their vocalized reason for wanting me to stay home, but they tend to keep things from me. For example, after attempted suicide at 15, I was not allowed to even touch the wheel of a car, therefore I got my license this year. Their rationale was, ""We can't afford a car."" The real reason, they told me afterwards, was that they thought I'd ram myself into a pole and kill myself. Totally understandable, but be upfront.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had THREE different therapists tell me that I need to go away to college, one being a very close friend of my mother's. They say that my family creates an unhealthy living environment that is detrimental to who I am as a person and of course would cause me to go to the lengths I did in the past. However, when any of them say something my parents don't agree with, they're written off and told, ""You don't know what you're talking about.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm sounding like an immature brat who just wants to get out of the house or if I have a real problem. All I know is I'm horribly depressed, haven't felt true joy in months (that could be because my doctor took me off all medication months ago to ""see what happens""), and can't stand the idea of being in my own home. Please help."

 With all that I still have to fake being happy towards everyone because I've had suicidal attempts in the past so I don't want them to worry, but now even two-three years out of schooling my thoughts have gotten extremely worse, I am constantly in this state of darkness always thinking when should be the day I try again, I don't like having these thoughts and I feel selfish that I do cause I know people will miss me, but I don't have the motivation to keep this lifestyle up and keep living."

Everyday there is a new issue although 9/10 it's just her coming home and venting every amount of anger she had claimed at work towards me and my child.

Out 1 yo is so happy to see her and all she can do is say she has a headache and pushes him away the poor boy cries and she yells at me as if it's my fault. 

The obvious thing to do would be to leave her but the last time I tried she tried to kill her self in our kitchen. Idk what to do and I feel trapped. On one hand I'll have her dead and my child motherless and on the other she might try to just up and take my kid away from me (again) and then call for me to have no rights.

870,I think I finally realized the missing part to why I have a hard time doing my work,"Hear me out, please.

For the longest time, I was subconsciously fighting my father. Over the years I became a pretty rough procrastinator, and my dad has constantly yelled at me to keep my grades up. I have a 98% grade average in middle school, but that dropped once I reached high school. My parents started fighting way more, and there was a whole ass month where there was constant fighting when my dad came home. My dad has practically equated my worth to my GPA, telling me I'll be going to Ivy League when I was 10 when I didn't even fucking know what that was. So these past two years I've been facing a rough burnout and realized the more my dad came home and lectured me for an hour, the more I didn't do shit...and now I finally realized that my grades are shit because I wanted to basically fuck over my father. Now I still have a hard time doing my work, but at least I know the huge cause. My mom tells me to just do it for myself, but that's hard to do when you've only been doing it to keep your dad happy your whole life because otherwise, he'd be a dick to you. Sorry for the pity party, does anybody have any tips?"
871,I think i wanna speak to a therapist but i cant ask my mom for one because she'll probably kill herself after i explain why i want one.,"I possess no empathy at all. I don't love anybody in my family and i wouldn't care if they all died. Im like this because of my moms ex. From the age of 2 all the way up to 15 (im 19 right now) all i saw was him abuse her physically, mentally, and emotionally. She had multiple chances to get him out of the picture but she thought that a horrible father figure was better than no father figure. I already tried to open up to her about how i feel (what i don't feel tbh) and she instantly made it all about her by asking if i still loved her. I fucking hate her. If i told her that i wanted a therapist because i cant feel anything due to her horrible taste in men and bad parenting skills then she would literally shoot herself in the face. Her dying will be inconvenient to the way that my life operates. She is actually a nice women but she is nowhere near a good mom(to me at least). My little sister seems to do okay.  If i could vent to someone in private for a bit then that would give me a chance to get some stuff off my chest."

I live in one of the best cities for healthcare (Boston), have good insurance and still - we have called over 20 child therapists that aren’t accepting new patients and have had Boston Children’s Hospital recommend a partial hospitalization program and guess what? There’s only ONE lone PHP program within a 40 mile radius of where I live that offers a program for children under 13.  This has been the most excruciating experience and I can only imagine how hopeless people feel in less populated areas with less access to healthcare. Why is it that we have to wait until children are suicidal in order to get immediate care?

I got diagnosed with depression &amp; bipolar disorder 10 years ago and have been on and off various mood stabilizers and antidepressants since then with little to no success. I recently started seeing a new psychiatrist who wants to start me on Vyvanse for my low mood and lack of energy (as well as the \~70 lbs I've gained in the past year due to the worsening depression).

I've been reading a good bit about Vyvanse, and honestly I'm a bit scared about taking it and I'm not sure if it would be worth it. I'm adopted so I have no knowledge of family history of addiction and I understand stimulants can be quite addictive. I think I'm most worried about becoming addicted and needing to stay on the drugs forever to feel normal. I'm also worried about the ""comedowns"" because I've heard it can be pretty awful when the drug wears off.

I'd love to hear some of your experiences with Vyvanse and how it has affected you and whether or not it was worth it for you. Any other advice you have for me is also greatly appreciated."

It's probably been going for a year already but it seems its slowly getting worse. Usually I don't think it's noticeable to other people but sometimes my head would jerk a bit. It would happen whenever I was stressed but now it's happening when i'm not bothered.
879,does anyone else have times of clarity and wonder what is wrong with me.,"i have times where like i kinda come to my senses and wonder wtf is wrong with me for sh
i ruined my arm but sometimes i want to and for short periods ill kinda understand how it can make normal people feel, especially when like recently for some stupid reason i put a gun to my head fast and dry fire and later ill see how crazy it is but feel like doing it again, i want to put a round in but i keep them locked so i dont do it on impulse.
i feel like 90% of the time im clouded and if im lucky the other ten is clarity."
880,MHI Independence Iowa Nostalgia (Christmas 2018),"So, I'm not going to tell my whole story, (because that would take forever) but on November 12th of 2018, I tried to hang myself with my scarf in a school bathroom. I was 17 at the time, but I was already diagnosed with depression, OCD, and a load of other stuff I can't remember. Anyway, after being stabilized and evaluated at the local hospital, I was transferred to this place in Independence, Iowa (I live around Cedar Rapids, if any of you know the area) and it's just really left an impression on me. I just can't get over the memories of that place, especially of the other patients. 

There was this one in particular I can't seem to get out of my head.  She was my age, maybe a year or two younger, had red hair, was kinda short, and she might've had some kind of eating disorder from how thin she was. I know I'm probably remembering falsely, or I'm looking too much into this, but it just felt like there was something really special we had. I remember we'd make faces at each other while the staff were giving lectures, we'd say ""eY b0ss!"" and other Filthy Frank quotes when we saw each other, and sometimes we'd play each other in Mario Kart or Smash Bros on the hospital's Wii. It all sounds silly in retrospect, but there was something about this girl that never failed to make me laugh or comfort me when I felt bad. 

There was this other memory that really sticks with me: we were sitting down for a lecture from the hospital's school faculty, and the two of us sat together. She was tearing up, so I asked if she was okay, and she said she'd be fine. I said that I'd try to be there for her, and she thanked me. I don't know why I remember this, but I just really felt for her, and I would've hugged her if it weren't for the rules and my fear of physical contact. In retrospect, I really wish I did. I know that thinking that is wrong and I shouldn't assume she'd be okay with that, but I just wish that for once in my life I'd been able to do something genuinely kind and meaningful for someone else.

I could really go on all day about this place and person, but I'll try to get to the point. I was transferred to another place in Des Moines around February, and finally came home last July. I've been trying to find this girl since I got home. I tried Instagram, and although I found two other friends I knew from the place, I still haven't found this one. I tried searching Google, but what good is knowing a first name and a vague mental image of who she was? So, I guess I'm turning to Reddit as a last ditch effort before I give up for good. If by some fluke anyone I know is on this sub, reads through this wall of text, and cares, my name is Dominic, and my friend's name is Olivia."
881,why am I so manipulative? do I have a real problem?,"first of all, this is an actual concern of mine. but I don't know if I'm willing to change, I just want to know if there's any mental problem here or if I'm just an asshole. I can't talk to anyone about this, otherwise they would find out that they were manipulated for no fucking reason and think that I am bad person (which I am, but I don't want anyone to think that)

I give good advice and always try to help people who are dear to me, I am seen as someone agreeable, kind and talented. BUT I lie all the time. sometimes to make myself look good, fun or smart. sometimes to make people think that I have problems that need to be taken care of. I always try to give the impression that I don't want any help and that I feel like a bother though. for example, I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I do have anxiety (I still fake it sometimes) but I'm not really depressed, I feel sadness like a normal person but those moments are rare. I have a very cold expression while I am alone cutting myself or attempting suicide, and when someone ""accidentally"" finds out I begin to cry and apologize (even though I not even a bit sorry or sad). I always knew I wasn't going to die, but I wouldn't mind if I did. the only problem would be getting brain damage so I try to avoid that. I also fake other symptoms like a fever (by putting a thermometer in hot water and sending someone a picture saying ""omg"") or passing out.

my point being. I'm clearly very manipulative and perhaps an attention whore (but I don't really want attention from many people, just the ones I care about). I have thought about narcissistic and borderline personality disorders. the second one seems a bit odd since I don't really feel much of that pain. I could be a narcissist but I really hope that I'm not one, they are a pain in the ass. on the other hand, I am very functional in relationships, I am good to people when I'm not lying to them (otherwise they wouldn't like me), some friends are alive today because I saved them from suicide attempts, some friends have healthy relationships because I gave them good advice (and because they tried hard to improve, of course). my girlfriend is really happy now that she has me as a partner and she says she is always willing to help me out with my ""problems"",  because I am so good to her that I give her energy to spend with me and others. that doesn't mean I'm not a bad person, though. maybe I'm just looking for someone to say that it's not really my fault that I'm like that, that I have mental issues and should be forgiven for that. but what I really think is that I am a manipulative bitch who turns out to be charismatic."
882,Mania? I’m not sure.,"My doctor told me I’m bipolar prone and put me on Prozac to treat my depression cause I didn’t have a definitive bipolar diagnosis yet. For the past week or so I’ve had this really weird manic episode that started off pretty hypomanic and was okay but now I’m pretty manic and I’m feeling really unwell (for lack of better words). I’m pretty sure the Prozac induced a manic episode and I’m really anxious, paranoid, unable to sleep, having racing thoughts, etc. and it’s really starting to unnerve me and make me even more anxious then I already am. I’m seeing my doctor in a few days but if anyone has any advice or anything to say I’d appreciate it :)"

884,"Code Words Help A LOT (long, sorry...)","TL;DR: It can be very valuable to assign recurring feelings, insecurities, or encounters code words that have special meaning to you (or maybe even between you and a loved one or trusted source you're trying to talk to).

.......

DISCLAIMER: Just to be clear up front, I am not at all advocating trying to hide or 'censor' any conversation about mental health -- that's not what this is about. If anything, I wanted to share this because I've found it more empowering than suppressive for long term struggle and healing. It's helped me get over some of my own hangups and embarrassments with mental health so that I could have some really productive ongoing and healthy conversations (or even just vents). I hope this may be of some help to someone.
This might sound silly but I swear by it and I wanted to post it here in case it might help anyone else.

.......

Forgive me if this is way too long but I want to make sure I communicate this right.

Bottom line, it can be really difficult to talk about mental health. For a number of reasons. Social stigma. Unsupportive/toxic environment. Even personal pride. 

While I hope we can get better as a society in talking about these things, I've personally found that using code words to talk about these issues can be really REALLY valuable. Here's my case for why:

1) COMMUNICATION -- I find code words can make it a lot easier to convey what it is you're feeling to someone else or even yourself. Especially if you use code words that have specific meaning. Another way to think of it is like mini metaphors you can keep in your back-pocket that only you and those you trust understand.

2) ACCESSIBILITY -- Code words make these conversations less scary. It can also make it easier and more approachable of a topic for people who want to help but might be more awkward or clumsy with the subject. People know what depression is, but not everyone knows what it is to you or even how to talk about it without feeling tense or nervous. Again, would love for this to all become more normal to discuss, but it does really make a conversation feel more approachable.

3) CONFIDENCE -- Code words sometimes just feel cool (or even funny). We should never be ashamed for how we're feeling. But that's much easier said than done, I know that for sure. While I don't want anyone to feel like they have to shy away from saying how they're really feeling, a cool, quippy, meaningful code word can frame the conversation completely differently. Again, I don't want people to feel this way, but sometimes when I talk about depression or loneliness by name, I can't help but feel weaker because of it. Not because I am weaker (I'm not and neither are you) but just because there's so much noise and shitty context and stigma we're wading through. With a code word, seriously, I feel like I'm a different person in a movie or a novel or something. Talking about badass cryptic mysteries and other enigmatic things. And that confidence with the code word has actually made me feel more comfortable using the real word, too.

4) LONGEVITY -- Mental health doesn't easily go away. For many of us, it'll be a lifelong scar or struggle in some way or another. And I believe that it's possible to live a full and happy life even with that as a part of your identity. And I think a part of walking that road is having support systems you can rely on. As silly as it may sound, having a roster of code words has truly equipped me to talk more openly and honestly about my mental health with my family. But it's also just helped me to internalize how I'm feeling as well. And many of my code words have been with me for years! And they still hold up. And they help me to frame how much progress I have made. And they make me feel like I can get a little bit more of a grip on how I'm feeling. I've still got a long way to go on some issues. But I've made a lot of progress.

5) OWNERSHIP -- Your code word is your own. You name it. Your define it. You change it or lose it if you need to. I'm one of those people who loves questions like ""if you were an animal what animal would you be"" because I love translating my identity to myself in creative ways like that. Honestly, it's exciting for me to find a new code word because it feels like I'm able to define a new part of myself I could quite categorize yet. And it can be literally whatever you wanted it to be. (I'm a grizzly bear btw)

6) DISCRETION -- I can't avoid the fact that I don't want to be talking over the phone about how lonely I might be feeling while walking around my neighborhood. Or even while texting in the office. I don't want to hide who I am. But honestly, I do. Not from everyone. But there are a lot of people out there who don't need to know. Code words allow you to form and dictate your own safe space. They allow you to invite only who you choose into that space. And you can sound like you're having an impressive business call to nosy neighbors listening in.

.......

This is already so long (sorry). But I figure it might express my point best if I could give some examples.

Here are some personal code words I use and what they mean. They're definitely not cool. But they have a cool meaning to me, personally, and that's what counts. Note! Some code words are positive, too!

1) ""KENOBI"": ""I'm having a Kenobi day.""
Explanation: I'm very introverted. Some days, I just want to hide, not have to talk to anyone and live in my apartment with my dog like a hermit. I like star wars and I love the character of Obi Wan Kenobi. I once read a SW book about him living like a hermit in the desert of Tatooine so whenever I feel super introverted, like I just want to putter around my desert homestead and meditate, I say I'm having a Kenobi day. I'm a huge fucking nerd, in case that wasn't clear.

2) ""CODE RED"": ""I've got a Code Red.""
Explanation: Not too difficult to figure out, but it's a little easier than saying I'm having a horribly bad day and I really need someone to talk to about some things.

3) ""TIGER"": ""I got to get rid of this Tiger.""
Explanation: Stress is a huge mental health problem I've struggled with. Our lives are extremely stressful and noisy yet the way the body handles stress is pretty much the same as it did when our ancestors had to get rid of a predator hunting them like a tiger. Fight or flight. Only problem? For most of us, our tigers aren't physical. How do you convince yourself you've escaped or defeated a tiger that isn't real? Seriously, if I ever wrote a memoire, I would call it ""Invisible Tigers."" When I say I have a tiger or there are too many tigers, it means there are too many things stressing me out that I can't tangibly solve or discard physically. This is a newer one but it's been so useful as of late.

4) ""ELEPHANT"": ""Had an Elephant today...""
Explanation: This one is a little tough to explain. I once read a psychology book that used metaphors to explain why humans think the way they do and it used this one metaphor of an elephant and a rider as a pair to symbolize human logic (the rider) and human gut intuitions (the elephant). Traditional psychology used to teach us that a sane rational person would use their logic and reasoning to dictate what their intuition would do (the rider is guiding the elephant). Dude then spends the entire first half of the book examining study after study to prove that it's actually the complete reverse and that's normal for a human being. Your elephant decides where it wants to go (I want to eat this, I don't want to go to that event, I'm irritated that person said that) and then your rider's job in the split second that follows is just to justify why your elephant is correct (because I was good today and I deserve it, because everyone will think I'm a loser there, because they're obviously ignorant and I'm right). Anyway (this is so long, I'm so sorry), whenever anything small or subtle irks me or gets under my skin or just makes me feel bad, like a comment or an inconsiderate whatever, I call it an elephant. And my family (who has also read the book) know exactly what I mean.

5) ""HIKING/CAMPING/CRATERING"": ""I'm hiking too much. I have to camp soon or else I'll be cratering.""
Explanation: My work has been crazy busy. It's been good for my career, terrible for my mental health and insecurities. I say I'm hiking when things are going so fast and I'm just caught up in the momentum. I know myself enough to know that I will get burnt out sooner or later and will have to stop hiking. But my hope is that I can do it carefully enough so that I can stop and rest where I'm at and enjoy the view (camping). Easier said than done. When you're going that fast, sometimes, if the rest stop comes too suddenly or at the wrong time, the sudden lack of momentum can be legitimate cause for depression. I call it cratering, like you were climbing up a mountain, but you suddenly fell off and are now cratering into the ground. I also sometimes call it 'WHIPLASH"" like a rubber band you stretched too far now coming back to hit you in the face.
 
.....

Good Lord. This is too long. I do apologize. I don't know if this resonates with anyone. This was just on my mind. Someone else in my life was telling me how useful this had become for themselves and I felt like it could be a good idea to share it.

One thing I also wanted to say is that I realize many people don't have someone in their lives they could make a code word with. I'm very lucky that I have a few people in my family who I've been able to trust with this excercise over the years.

If anyone out there would be interested, I would be more than happy to talk to you or even help you out in coming up with some code words you could use -- please comment or DM me if you'd like that.

Again. I'm not advocating we censor ourselves. Please don't feel ashamed in any way for how you are feeling or any need/desire you have to express yourself.

I truly believe something like this can go a long way and even be a bit fun at times -- make what can often be a difficult, even baffling process and make it easier. Even for just a little while.

Bottom line, we need better language for mental health. Until we get one, though, make up your own."
885,Seeing a new Psychiatrist,"I have an appt with a new psychiatrist Monday. But I have this issue I can’t seem to control. I basically tell them what I think they want to hear, or what a normal person would say. I make my life seem much better than it is. Don’t get me wrong, I have a good life. But I have some shit I need to deal with &amp; I can’t seem to tell them about it. I’ve been to many doctors &amp; I do it every time, even with the intention of going and spilling my guts. Any suggestions?? 😓"
886,It's probably nothing,"this probably doesn't fit in but oh well. I think I might have some sort of paranoia. When I hear people in the Halls of my apartment or hear the people above me I usually put myself in a hidden place. My friend and my girlfriend had to talk me out of keeping a shotgun under my bed when I told them it was there. I've always slept with a knife in or around my bed. I constantly fear people slandering me to my friends and family. if two or more look at me, even friends, I think they're talking about me. When I see maintenance people outside my apartment pass by my window, my heart drops. This is probably something simple like anxiety or some shit but I feel like venting a little bit."
887,Suffering with bipolar and probable ppd. Been closing in on myself. Tomorrow theres hope for true help,"So my baby is 17 days old. I had to go back to school a few days ago. I've been dealing with such unpredictable moods. I loathe my new instructors teaching style. And finally at the end of the day I had. I couldnt take her inability to control the class so we could actually learn. 15 k is what I'm paying to not be with my baby 4 hours a day and to end up self teaching everything anyway.

So I emailed my schools counselor about how to go about dropping out or transferring. Well that started a shit storm. See I'm top of my class. I took a leave of absence to have my baby and came right back due to my fasfa being declined if I didnt. So I did the hardest thing ever. I left my baby in the care of my husband, her father and his family during the day.

I couldnt do it anymore. Well my consoler didnt respond for over a hour. Instead my previous teacher blew up my phone asking why the hell would I dare dropping out. That I have so much potential. That she hasnt seen a student with no former or even with a former backround in my area of study pick it up so well and fast. I ignored this. Then my consoler called. Again i ignored this. Then my current teacher called. Again ignored this. See i feel so hopeless i didnt wanna have to explain myself.

Well my previous instructor contacts me again. She states she would really like to hear anything from me as she was getting concerned. I admire this women. The only person I've ever looked up to. So I caved. And I told her the truth. I didnt touch on the fact I dislike my class and new teacher. But I told her I was struggling and didnt see how I could succeed. That I go to class and feel like a moron. That I'm doing everything to stay caught up and care for my baby but that I'm letting self care be opitional.

I opened up I told her about the fact I spend most my time outside of class terrified my baby will die because of issues shes having, and sobbing. That I dont eat much anymore. That I dont sleep. That I'm getting each day that passes more and more dark and twisty thoughts. See she has a masters in psychology. She knows im trying get into the field myself. She asked me to self assess. I told her ""well im a unmedicated bipolar axis 1 person with probable postpartum depression or psychosis acurring""

She asked me if I know what's wrong why hadnt I asked for help sooner. I told her the trouble about being self aware with mental health issues is seeing what wrong but being so ran down you can summon the energy to fix it. She told me to come back to class tomorrow. That on break shell help me get a appointment with someone who specializes with my troubles. She said she knows it's hard. And she didnt judge anything I told her. No in fact she shared her similar struggles and how she herself needed someone to help her.

I may not feel better for a while. I may end up having my class and new teacher. But maybe once i get help itll be managable. I wont spend every moment consumed with rage, anxiety and sadness. I finally see a silver lining. I finally have hope again for the first time in months. And it makes me cry... but for once out of happiness."
888,I feel hurt and broken,"I feel hurt and broken, that I let everyone down, and that I'm not good enough. I feel like I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown, and that I'm getting more and more unstable. All I ask is a helping hand"
889,Oppositional defiance disorder,Does anyone have any experience with ODD? My 16 year old sister was recently diagnosed and I’m struggling to connect with her. If I do anything that’s not in her favor she refuses to talk to me for weeks. I live out of state and try and visit as much as possible but the way she acts towards me makes it so hard and I’m just trying to understand.
890,So incredibly lonely but too unmotivated to do anything about it.,"I've been mostly hiding out in my room for days and i'm so people starved. I got a few errands done yesterday, which felt good, but I spent all day in here today and I just need real human connection or it feels like i'm gonna drown. When i do try to interact with people it feels like i'm not even a person bc it's been so long since i've interacted with anyone. I joined a gym yesterday and while the guy was showing me around and signing me up, I was a shaking mess and I was so embarrassed. But I hate just laying here, alone with my thoughts about all the bad stuff that's happened and could happen. I hate this feeling, it feels like it never ends."
891,I am losing my mind,"I feel disconnected from my own brain. I can’t string my thoughts together and I can’t hang on to any of these thoughts for very long. 

When I am working, the best I can do is scribble sentences. I wouldn’t say im procrastinating b/c i literally sit at my desk for hours trying to work. And though I try so hard at work but I haven’t actually done anything in months. i can try to describe it but something is just... *wrong.* 

Have you ever held a water hose but when you folded it, or tied it in a knot, the water stoped coming out of the spout. That’s how I feel. Its like multiple pipes are sending thoughts, electricity, movement, etc. But there is just something blocking those thoughts and intentions. I feel backed up, but like in my mind. I know none of this makes sense but it hurts. And this isn’t an exact analogy but have you ever walked into a room and forgot what you were doing? I feel that every 30 seconds. And i feel so much anxiety over it.

It started out slow, just problems here and there.  But now I can barely string enough thoughts together to brush my teeth, read a menu, or clean my apartment. Leaving my apartment gets really scary and these knots in my mind just leave me foggy. When people talk to me, I can hear them but at the same time..*i can’t.* Its like they are underwater or are in a different room. 

Its seeped into my dreams too. I have “nesting” dreams 2 or 3 times a week. They are dreams where I “wake up” and “get dressed,” only to discover that I’m dreaming and am actually still in bed. I wake up and do my routine 3 or 4 times in my dreams before I wake up and can do it for real. The first time I couldn’t tell when I was dreaming but now I know instantly. But I can’t break the dream, i just wait. One time, I fell asleep on the couch and my mom, who doesn’t live with me, was on the edge of the couch when i awoke. She wasn’t doing anything, she was just *there* I knew i was dreaming but the only thing i could do was go through the cycles until i woke up again and again and again

i do not know if the dreams have anything to do with my inability to keep thoughts. But everything that’s happening is making it really difficult to know what is real and what isn’t. idk, im in so much pain and i feel like im losing my mind. my reflection doesn’t feel like me. my hands don’t feel like my hands. Everything has an echo and my shoulders are heavy. Like someone is behind me.

This is insane so im gonna stop but still i wish i could just snap out if it. it seems so melodramatic. like oh my goodness just be normal"
892,Work Problems,I was told by my boss today that she’s concerned about my performance/progress. I’ve been in training for 6 months and have another 6 months to go...then she also says she thinks I don’t care about the job which is completely wrong. I’m just sick of being depressed and needed to tell someone. I was feeling like I was improving and now I’m being told I’m not and I should know a lot of the things I ask about. I just spent 4 hours of time at home studying codes I was supposed to know already. My anxiety was staring to improve and then this shit happens. I just don’t know what to do anymore 😢

She told me that there’s nothing to worry about when it comes to being schizophrenic or anything like that. She said that even though I’m on medication for anxiety and have been feeling less anxious.

First is my supervisor, she has reminded me at least once a week that I’m on probation and that it’s to see if I feel like I’m a good fit and if she thinks I’m a good fit (essentially telling me that she can fire me on the spot), she’s a micromanager, and when she needs something from any of us that check patients in, she doesn’t care to check if we’re busy with something, she wants us there and paying full attention. Oh and she only seems to care if I’m in dress code but doesn’t say a thing when some of my other coworkers are clearly breaking dress code. In a couple of weeks we’ll be having a meeting to talk about anything that we find stressful but I also don’t want to throw her under the bus since she is nice at times. 

Secondly, there’s lots of patients with sad cases like they had a stroke and can no longer do what they were able to before or in chronic pain, and a majority of the time I have no clue how to respond or how to react. I feel like I’m not genuine if I say “I’m sorry” and based off of my own chronic health condition, I know they probably hear that a lot. I want to be able to comfort them but not seem generic or scripted. And like yesterday I checked in a patient and she had MS and her body couldn’t stay the slightest bit still and found myself getting almost annoyed at how much she was moving even though I know it was out of her control, and today there was a guy that had had a stroke and his right side was a bit messed up and his hand was pressing and at times rubbing his groin area and again I know it was out of his control but it made me uncomfortable."
898,How does it feel to NOT have ADHD?,"I (23F) was just diagnosed with inattentive ADHD. I meet pretty much all of the symptoms on a consistent basis and have since I was a kid. I have a hard time focusing even when people are speaking directly to me, I have poor attention to details, am reading things over and over again to understand them, I'm just generally spacey and disorganized in my life. 

 However, I'm grappling with this diagnosis because I've dealt with these symptoms all of my life and just thought it was ""*normal""* or that everyone deals with these things consistently on a day-to-day basis. I thought other things were just quirks about my personality not something that I could potentially make better. 

So I'm just curious for those of you without attention problems, what does your life look like? How do you get through meetings, conversations, and classes? Can you be consistently attentive for say-- an hour long period? I feel like hearing if other people have different experiences will help me understand my problem more clearly."
899,I’m scared of myself,And I don’t know why
900,I became the person I needed help from...,"I was practicing piano a few weeks ago (currently self-teaching). I was trying to learn chords when a friend texts me. She asks if she could call and I said sure. She's on the phone, crying and panicking. I asked what was wrong. She said she's freaking out and it could be psychosis, and was worried her boyfriend will leave her if he finds out about her mental state.

I talk as calmly as possible. I ask her to ground herself. ""Point at random things around your room, name them, and describe them."" She calls out a pillow, the bedding, the carpet, the mug, and the TV. I then ask her to breathe in for 5 secs, breathe out for 5 secs. In the nose, out the mouth.

She tried to hold in her tears. I say, ""Please don't hold it. Let it out. It'll hurt if you keep it in."" She starts bawling, apologizing for being a terrible person, bothering my day, not being a good enough friend. I told her that she has nothing to apologize for. She has done nothing wrong. She's just in pain and needs help. I told her she did the right thing by calling me and congratulated her for doing it. I told her she deserves to feel happy and safe.

After half an hour, she calms down. She starts talking in complete sentences and with a natural tone. She confesses that I am her bestest friend now. Her other friend left due to some bad influences from other people. I told her that I'm happy to have that title and that she was my bestest friend too. She thanks me for the help. I said ""thank you for calling me. I'm here for you. You're never alone."" We hung up and went about our days.

I had always wanted someone to do this for me. I would've loved calling someone when I was in pain and just cry on the phone with no judgement from them. Instead, I became that person. I became the help. And I will continue to be that person. I don't want anyone to go through what I had to experience alone."
901,Why am I so weak?,"Hi all, I'm new here so please forgive me if I format this all wrong, I'll be as brief as possible. I have been a stay-at-home mom of one child (17m) for about 6 months now, and I love it; I feel like the time with my daughter has given me the best mental health I've had in this lifetime (I'm 33, have Bipolar II). Recently we ran into a tight spot financially and so this past Monday I began babysitting 2 boys (ages 1 &amp; 3) in their home. The plan is for me to keep them just MWF. They're good kids, I still have my daughter with me, so all is well, right? Easy money... Except it's not. I have only watched them the one day so far (yesterday) and since my daughter and I got home from their house I have been SEVERELY depressed at the thought of having to go back, and especially at possibly having to do this long term. Not for any tangible reason, other than it's disrupting this peaceful little day-to-day that I've built with my daughter the past 6 months. I know that sounds ridiculously lazy and selfish, I know that people have to do MUCH harder things to survive, but I truly don't have control over this feeling. I have been crying and nauseous all day today. My wonderful, amazing mom has offered to help us financially (which she does too much of already) so that I can continue to stay home, because she knows how much I've struggled to he happy in my life and how happy I am now. Do I admit defeat and welcome her help until we get out of this bind? Or do I suck it up and keep at the babysitting? I really hope this doesn't make me sound like a spoiled brat, I am doing my best to overcome this depressive feeling but it's rocking my world, and not in a good way."

903,My marriage counselor privately told my husband I might have BPD and I am kind of annoyed by it.,"My marriage counselor witnessed my husband and I fight for the first time. I was really tired that morning which did not help my mental state, started crying, and walked out. After this shitty session, my husband and I talked things through... we both apologized and made up, and he told me that she thinks I have borderline personality disorder. 

Very distraught by this, I went to my personal therapist about this and she was quite taken aback that our counselor diagnosed me after seeing one fight. My personal therapist has diagnosed me with PTSD from childhood sexual abuse.

Today I asked my psychiatrist about the BPD diagnosis and he was also unimpressed by our marriage counselor suggesting that. He told me that BPD is one of the toughest mental disorders to treat, and that a lot of therapists won't work with patients who have it. He then started asking me questions about past relationships (have you stalked, have you threatened your life, have you thought highly of your spouse one day and thought he was the worst the next?) Nope. None of those.

He reassured me that diagnosing people is a tough business, and that he personally wouldn't diagnose me with BPD or PTSD. He said maybe I have traits similar to these disorders, but they are mild.

I feel betrayed/annoyed by my marriage counselor. In the next session we had, she did not bring it up to me.

TLDR; Marriage counselor told husband behind my back that I might have BPD. She was probably wrong."
904,so i tried to kill myself and it didn’t work. now what? having trouble figuring out how to get back to normal life.,"Last night i was hanging out with friends drinking quite a bit and ended up trying to kill myself with a kitchen knife. I’ve been debating it for some time but for some reason i woke up on my friends couch after being passed out for a bit around 4 or 5am, saw the knife and just thought i’d try it. once i started bleeding (there was so much blood), i yelled for my friend and he came and helped me. my dad’s wife works in the ICU so i texted her and said i was coming to see her for help and not to tell my dad. somehow i convinced my friend to take me to my car so i could drive myself (keep in mind we were still pretty intoxicated). he dropped me off and i went to start my car and not only was it dead but the key got stuck IN the ignition so i couldn’t even walk away. i ended up calling my dad and he took me to the hospital and i got stitches then me, my dad and his wife all just went to breakfast and went home. my birthday is in two days and i have all these plans with friends and family and i just kind of disappeared today. haven’t talked to anyone. i still want to die but seeing my dad so upset and the thought of hurting anyone else makes me not want to. I always thought if i ever tried and was unsuccessful, i’d feel some overwhelming sense of relief but it’s the opposite. I just feel crazy and like I caused a fuss. How do I just go back to living life? Also, how do i explain this cut on my arm to my friends and coworkers?

tl;dr: tried to kill myself. didn’t work. don’t know how to explain this stitched up cut on my arm to friends/coworkers. how do i go back to living life normally again?"
905,I can’t breath,"Um so yea, I think there’s something wrong with me, well duh there something wrong with me. I guess what I’m trying to say is the last couple of years I haven’t been ok... which I’m sure many of you who read this aren’t ok either, I hope it gets better whom ever you are. Ok I’m getting of topic here, for the last couple of years I’ve felt a constant feeling of fear (like I can’t breath) I’m so afraid of everything, not like horror movies or roller coasters. I’m afraid I’ll never be normal, I’ll never do good in school, hang out with my friends, fall in love. I don’t know why I always feel that way and the irony is I’m too afraid to ask. I can’t ask for help right now, I’ve tried before but, when I did it.. just was a joke to my family. Anyways I can’t ask again right now because of everything that’s going on right now. So I’m here. I think I have anxiety, most likely social. I’ve done research and that lines up. It’s feels better to finally let go. Thank you, for reading"
906,Didn't thought this was possible,"Last night got a really heavy anxiety attack, couldn't sleep till 6am, good thing I'm on vacations, thing is just so happens I need to return to said place and I'm getting anxious of thinking if this will happen again, just so happens that place is my bed and now I'm dying on the inside."

908,Does anyone feel that having unlimited internet access has killed their desire to form relationships?,"I'm 30 years old, and I've spent most of my life depressed and isolated. So, naturally I've spent thousands of hours browsing reddit and watching Youtube videos about anything and everything, indulging every curiosity I've ever had. I've followed social trends, learned about psychological phenomena, probed into all sorts of crap basically. I'm not particularly knowledgeable about anything, but I have this sense of knowing all of the fundamentals... the most important stuff, and I feel like it's a major factor in why I have so little interest in getting to know anyone.

What would I stand to gain from forming new relationships? They aren't going to introduce me to some new topic I had never heard of or thought about before. They aren't going to tell me some new joke I haven't heard before. Any interaction we might have could only be a variation on something I've already seen or experienced a thousand times already.

I'm a little envious of people who lived in the pre-internet days, as they had a major incentive to interact with others and make friends; they could reasonably expect that others might be able to introduce them to something new! This is one of the reasons I feel so empty, and as though I'm already at the end of life. Everything's already been done.

Perhaps it's my own fault, because I suppose that other people who haven't relied on the internet as their sole window into the world still have curiosities and a sense of wonder, and I've killed that in myself.

I've just realised the irony of writing all these things, while simultaneously seeking to have a conversation with others about it which, according to my feelings on the matter, shouldn't be particularly interesting. I guess I'm just in the mood to hear some new stories from people who've screwed their lives up as badly as I have."
909,Is cutting own hair on bad days self harm??,"I get depressed if I'm not busy, so on lazy Sundays if I'm alone all day I have a huge urge to cut my hair. On such days I only cut half an inch and doing so makes me feel really good. But when I was depressed for the first time after being played by a guy I cut 15 inches of hair and felt good for couple of days. Is this self harm?? Cause I care the most about my hair, like I don't care if I have no make up on.. but I am very consious about my hair."
910,Dealing with imposter syndrome coming into uni?,"So, I got good marks in school and, because of that, I got into law at university. After I got accepted, I was okay at first and I genuinely thought I was going to be fine, but, as the start of the school year has gotten closer, I can't help but feel like I can't do this. 

I got really good marks at school. Straight As besides Mathematics, which doesn't really matter anyway since Law is really intertwined with maths at all. Anyway, I wrote good essays and I always came up with solid arguments when we had to write persuasive texts. However, I can't help but think that was all a fluke now, like the teachers just felt sorry for me so they gave me good marks or I was everyone's favourite and was given good marks for work that was actually subpar. I can't help but think that it's all been a lie that's over now and, once I start law, I'm going to get the marks I deserve and fail out. No matter how much I've tried thinking positively, it hasn't worked, and I'm terrified to start school again because I'm dreading what might be coming. To put it simply, how do I feel better?"
911,Possible OCD?,"Hello all. I recently came to a realization that tasks that are outside of my daily routine are a pain to complete. For example, I recently had to make an appointment with my dentist and I waited forever to confirm it because I felt like it was too much of an inconvenience. Is this a form of OCD or something else?"
912,Anybody wanna just talk as friends or something?,I got some shit on my mind and wanna bounce it off someone
913,Intrusive thoughts,"I have always had a little anxiety since I was small. When I was 12 almost 13, I was taking a shower and I had a religious intrusive thought. It scared me so bad. I quickly got out and dressed.  I went into the living room with my mom and tried to watch tv to clear my mind, but there it was again: another intrusive thought but worse this time. Something was wrong, i had no idea what was going on. Suddenly the Intrusive thoughts started to replay like it was on a loop and the loop would never stop. I thought I was going crazy, I thought to myself why would I think these things they are not me.

I started to have a panic attack. I ran into the kitchen to get a drink of water to calm me down, but it didn’t help. My mom was clueless what was going on. I didn’t tell her what was going on.  I ran into my room and grabbed my bible to read it. I prayed over and over for God to forgive me for the thoughts in my head.

I was so worried. I love my relationship with God. These thoughts were harmful towards it. When I got one, I would say under my breath, “i would never say that” over and over and over. People thought I was talking to my self when I did that. I got bullied at school about it. 

Months went by and I still hadn’t told no one. My parents knew something was wrong with me but I would deny it. It started to get worse and worse. I would set in my room and cry all night because I couldn’t go to sleep, because the thoughts haunted me.

Suddenly, the intrusive thoughts were about the people I loved. I hated myself. Why would this happen I thought 

I thought I was going crazy. It got worse when my uncles house burned down and his mom and him had to stay with us for a while. I let his mom use my room, and I had to share one with my mom. I was depressed, I had no room to go calm my self down in. Eventually I would lock my self in the bathroom and lay on the floor to cry. My friend group had broken up also which made matters worse


My mom finally got me into counseling. But I wasn’t truthful to my counselor. I wouldn’t tell her the cause of my panic attacks were the thoughts. I had no idea what they were called. I thought they were me. I was so ashamed of them. After about a a couple of weeks of counseling, they tested me for ADHD (the results came back negative). Then they diagnosed me with General anxiety disorder. They gave me medicine that didn’t work because the thoughts were still there

I was at the lowest of lows at 14. I was so depressed. I was on 7 pills a day. No one new the cause why, only I did. One day it got so bad, I cried to my mom and told her what was going on with the thoughts. We did researching and researching and learned that they was intrusive thoughts.

My brother came out and told us he had them to. We told the counselor the cause of my mental health. We learned coping skills and I got on new medicine. I slowly was getting better and better. I finally felt like me in the first time in 2 years. 

It’s been a year since then and I am 15 now. I feel so better. I just wanted to make this post to say that even when you feel like your going to die and never make it out of the slump you are in, it does get better. It takes time. If you have intrusive thoughts please please please tell someone about them you will feel tens times better. I thank God I am better. Of course there are still bad days but it gets better"
914,hitting myself as a way to deal with sadness,"Anytime I have a negative thought or memory enters my head I hit myself repeatedly in the head...hard. Its the only thing that works and grown to like the pain I endure, it keeps me focus and calm and collective so I can communicate with other people. The world brings me down too much and I wish people saw the beauty of life as I do. No one's obligated to share my views but all people ever do is argue unable to see their similarities and embrace their differences and unwilling to cooperate to make the world a better place to provide the future generations an opportunity to flourish. I scream my head off (literally) sometimes when I see hostility in the world/social media and perhaps I am too idealistic but I have so much hope for the world but it slowing fleeting away and so am I. I hit myself while crying and I filled with questions of morality, logic, politic and the human condition but all it ever does is cause me pain. I am not that type of person to say ""ignore the problems of the world and say nothing"" because I want many things to be improved but people are too...hateful to even see eye to eye.  It doesn't help I have voices in my head (not auditory) of people telling me I am not good enough or am a terrible person. I just want to perish from existence it is too painful to not have anyone experience it with me. (sorry for any typo's)"

916,Going off meds,"I'm 28M with schizophrenia. I've been on anti-psychotics for three years, and it's had a very negative impact on my life. I've only ever had one episode, however, and my psychiatrist is helping me get off such drugs. She thinks my original diagnosis was not entirely correct, and she thinks I shouldn't have any issues if I avoid things which might cause a relapse into my symptoms, like recreational/psychedelic drugs and stuff.

I've been a writer for a long time, and before I was diagnosed I was getting along by doing freelance writing/editing, small jobs, research for lazy college students, etc. The drugs took away my ability to do that. I don't really have any ambitions in life that aren't artistic, so my self esteem has been not so good. It's difficult to write even stuff like what I'm doing right now.

Honestly, I've been torn trying to decide whether or not I can believe anti-psychotic drugs are even ethical. It really is a chemical lobotomy (a chemical castration as well...). Obviously, in the opinion of those who treat you, you are being returned to a functional state. You're being given the ability to properly take care of yourself. They are stunting your dangerous behaviors. But even still... at least when I was sick I felt alive. Being on anti-psyches has been like not having a soul.

I think, if I had the opportunity to support a medical study, I would probably donate money to the research of anti-psychotic drugs. I know there are many worthwhile studies in medicine, like cancer research and etc., but I'm swayed by my personal experience. I just wish such drugs weren't so damning. You may not take up permanent residence in an asylum these days, but it's a prison all the same.

I guess this is just a venting post. Honestly, I know I such be happy and excited to return to my old self, but I'm kind of scared. I feel like I really need it to work out, and if it doesn't, I don't know what I'll do. My psychiatrist was really cold at first, even cynical of my appearance and what she assumed my lifestyle was like, but we've become good friends over the years. We even sometimes go for coffee. She's warmed up to me after we spent so much time talking. I trust her when she reassures me I should be fine, I just can't seem to shake the anxiety though."
917,I often don't feel real.,"I have difficulty fitting in or connecting with others, forming relationships is hard, I have only had one serious girlfriend in my life. I often change my interests on a weekly basis. It's not completely random but the change definitely happens. It's like there is this void in the center of me and I am trying desperately to find pieces that fit it, to make myself an actual person, not some weird alien."
918,How do you know where depression ends and unhappiness begins?,"Genuine question. I’ve been clinically depressed for well over 10 years. I’ve gone from “sad” to downright suicidal, taking pills hoping I don’t wake up. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had my “good” streaks where I feel like a human and like I’m *living* my life and not just surviving it..but I’m starting to question whether my current mental state is due to a chemical imbalance, or due to me just being an unhappy person in life. I suffer with other mental health issues other than depression as well and I’ve taken them all into account. For example, the past 2-3 months I became explosively angry and filled with rage and hatred. This is a symptom of one of my other mental health illnesses. I got put on a mood stabilizer and instead of being explosively angry, I’m simply just mean. I’m numb to happiness and I’m just mean, unhappy, and yes, still angry. I’ve felt this negativity for a year and a half now and I’m really not sure if it’s something that can be fixed with medication. 

So how do we figure out if our emotions are caused by a chemical imbalance, or caused by simply being unhappy with life’s circumstances?"
919,my son is the only reason I'm still here...,"I want to vent but I cant find the words. The suicidal feeling is so heavy right now I'm struggling to breathe. there's no voice in my head telling me to die, it's just a feeling I have. I have no idea how to explain it but it's driving me crazy and I'm in my car tempted to drive off a fucking bridge right now. I'm in therapy, I go to church, I take meds, I do everything I can to make myself better and nothing is helping in the least fucking bit. I genuinely think I have something worse than just depression and anxiety. something is fucking wrong with my brain and oh god I just want it to be fucking over

sorry.. I want to scream to everyone at the top of my lungs that something is wrong but the people in my life are not the kind of people you can do that to. my whole family and my boyfriend..  they don't believe in being suicidal. they say if I really wanted to die I would've already done it. I've tried to vent to them and they just say I'm attention seeking blah blah blah

I've been to the psychiatric hospital 3 times already and if I go back again I legally have to stay for a minimum of 6 months and i can't be away from my breastfed son for that long obviously
i dont know what to do i feel like I'm suffocating and I really really feel like I could literally die from the way I am feeling. like physically my body feels like its shutting itself down because it's just so sad and tired or something

rant over I guess, thanks for coming to my Ted talk or whatever"
920,Having a toxic personality is exhausting sometimes,"It’s tiring to have the envy levels of a literal 2 year old and having to mask it all the time. I can’t enjoy art, sometimes can’t enjoy music, or other people’s aesthetics without spiraling into hardcore envy. People’s happiness is a punch to the face to me, and I suspect I only spread misery bc I’m inwardly miserable. It’s no secret I have zero self esteem, so I make sure to knock down others’s. I need outward validation all the time, and if I don’t get it, I’m painfully upset. I have constant revenge fantasies, as well as those of awe and power, not to mention sexual ego boosts as well. I like testing the limits of people’s patience, and I know I’m a shit person, but I can’t seem to stop. 

Come to think of it, I don’t like other people’s emotions or pain. One of my friends was going through some hard shit and I just ignored them bc I can’t be bothered- there is zero way I could have helped them, so why just give useless and baseless comments like “it gets better” and “you’ll be fine”? It makes zero sense to me. Yet when I explained that sentiment, I got criticized for being cold. I’m not trying to be, but it literally made no sense to me?? Same thing for wanting my presence around even if they were too busy to talk to me. It made no logical sense and I got called a robot for it lmao.

This isn’t to say I’m completely lacking empathy lol. Empathy is what makes me *human*. I know I feel it bc I get feelings from music and other people sometimes. But it’s super annoying to have to fake things for others, and to have such sensitive emotions where I can barely take any criticism at all. Even Bob Ross is aggravating and condensing as fuck to me, even though he doesn’t mean to be. I can’t stand famous people bc they’re getting so much praise that I’m not, and it feels like if I’m not on top of the world, I’m on rock bottom."
921,Is self harm a drug?,"So on the 26th I’ll be 3 months clean. Even though it has felt like forever since I cut myself, I still feel compelled to do it. It almost feels like I am addicted to the high I get when I hurt myself. Almost like it is a drug. It’s weird because I feel like I am going through withdraw and need so do it just to satisfy that need to cut. Anyone have any ideas of how to deal with this without hurting myself again?"
922,I feel like everything's gone wrong and I'm in a bad place,"I feel like I only have enough luck to still be alive, but nothing more. I've been working overtime (6 days a week on night shift) for the past month and a half. We got new managers recently, and they've made work Soo much worse. They talk about people, call people out, it's bad. I'm burnt out, and I don't feel good today, so I called in. A few minutes later, I get a call from a manager who's been there less than a week, basically saying if I don't come in or have a doctor's note they'll fire me, despite never calling in since I've been there. I haven't had time to do much of anything other than work. Haven't been to the doctor, can barely even do things like going to the store. I barely even have energy to play videogames, even though I used to really enjoy them. My cat is just about the only positive thing I have right now. Im just feeling really stuck"
923,Sleeping problems,Last night when I was trying to go to sleep it was so so werid. Like as soon as I shut my eyes it was like there was a flashing light in front of them. I kinda dosed off but had really vivid dreams and then woke myself up scared. They only lasted for a few seconds and I was not asleep tho. Idk it was jsut so werid and I could hear noises and it felt like I was going crazy. It reminded me of when I’m high and u drift off in ur high and then bring ur self back to reality it was kind of like that but me ‘dreaming’ i guess. I’m not sure has anyone ever had this.
924,"I just self-harmed for the first time in a while because 2020 I've been sad all of the time, and I feel so much better.","I stopped self-harming for others, not for myself. It made me happier short-term, but didn't fix anything long-term. But sometimes I needed that short-term happiness, or else I'd fucking spiral.
So I just flicked tiny rubber bands on my arm just now, and it's just bliss, mainly because I feel more connected to reality. I'm much closer to being able to cry than I was before, which is awesome. (I don't cry much at all anymore. Too damaged)
So I'm gonna start self-harming again, while also working on my long-term mental health. Gradually exposing myself to things that make me anxious. Getting myself angry and using a coping skills in that moment against every ounce of defiance. 
God I'm the happiest I've been in all of 2020 right now. :D
I promise I won't really injure myself. For now, just rubber bands. :)"
925,I (34M) have always been ready to get off of the ride.,"first i would like to start by saying that this isnt a cry for help, a threat or anything of the sort. I do have a diagnoses as BPD, but i have always kind of questioned it. i am currently taking medications, and doing therapy. Since as far back as i couldnt remember i have always had this feeling that something was not right. It has always been something on my mind, and it was on occasion something that i have had a hard time coping with. I have am pretty consistently in a depressed state. At the same time though im not sure if i would even label it as such. i suppose the best way i could describe it really is that like the comedian Bill Hicks used to say that life was just a ride, its all great and there are highs and lows and such but eventually it ends, and thats okay. I know that i have pretty much just got on the ride, i havent been on for long, and im not afraid of speed or heights or anything but im just ready to get off, not because im having the worst time or anything like that, im not really even all that depressed. im just tired, i am not sure if i ever even wanted to get on the ride. but i feel like im ready to get off, i think at this point im only still on is because of my family, i dont want to ruin their time at the theme park. im not really asking for advice or anything, i guess im just asking if anyone else has ever really felt like that."
926,My Friends Keep Forgetting About Plans/What They Say and It’s Making Me Feel Negative,"Around 2-4 months ago, two of my closest friends started becoming more distant. It started off as not inviting me to play video games with them, and they would start talking about it the next day (which made me feel left out). Then one of them started to forget details about me or about plans.

An example would be when we arrived to school together. One of his friends came up to talk to him, so he said he would meet me later in the cafeteria. I go to the cafeteria, sitting at a table. Ten minutes go by. Another ten minutes go by. He doesn’t come in. I’m kicked out of the cafeteria as school starts in 5 minutes. As I walk out, I see him in the yard talking with his friends. This makes me extremely pissed off as he said he would meet me in the cafeteria. I walk towards him, but even when I’m less than five feet away, he doesn’t acknowledge me. Later I ask him what happened and he says he forgot about going to the cafeteria. 

I’m extremely sensitive of friends forgetting about plans we made together or not listening to me then asking what I was talking about. Especially if it’s close friends, so this event made me feel horrible inside. I kept thinking, “Am I so worthless that I’m that easily forgettable?”. 

Just today, something else made me snap. My other close friend (female) hung out with me today. We made plans to have a fun girls night playing video games, as we hadn’t played together in a while. I decided to finish my homework before we played (without procrastinating for once) and I managed to finish in 10 minutes. When I texted her that I finished my homework, she said that she was playing a game with our other close friend because I was slow. I got a little pissed, but she said she would play with me after one match with him. So I waited. Twenty five minutes go by. Nothing. I check their Discord and realize that they switched to a different game. Of course, this makes me angry again. I text my female friend. Ten minutes go by. I finally get a response. She claims that our other friend proposed to play a quick round on this other game. I get even more mad. She didn’t have to do it, but she still accepted it, knowing that I was waiting. He also knew that me and her had plans to play yet still proposed to play with her. Maybe I would’ve been fine if they simply invited me to play with them. I’m not sure anymore. 

Yeah, maybe I am overreacting, but I’m overly sensitive of these things because of people who betrayed my trust before. Sure, I wouldn’t be angry if they only forgot every now and again. But it happens every other time we plan something, and it’s getting on my nerves. Is it my fault? Am I such a bad friend that they feel the need to make excuses to avoid me? Am I so boring and worthless that they’ve decided they don’t want to be my friend anymore? Should I just forget about all the times they forget? I guess I’m asking for advice about what to do or how I should react to dealing with negative thoughts because of people forgetting about me or if I’m overreacting/in the wrong. 

(Sorry if it’s hard to read, I’m not good at putting my thoughts into words. Also sorry if formatting is bad, I’m on mobile.)

TLDR: My closest friends keep forgetting about plans we make and I feel as if I’m not worth remembering about because of this."
927,I talked to my friend on the phone after a month and a half and I feel so happy.,"It was a 10 minute conversation. I was awkward and nervous. But I did it.

Backstory: I have huge anxiety, and even talking to my friends through text or on the phone is a problem for me. I had been texting my friend for more than a month since we last hung out and my brain freaked out humongously whenever I got a text from them, even if they laughed at my jokes I always thought I was being weird, awkward, or said something offensive when texting them. When they didn't respond right away I wouldn't sleep at night thinking I had said something dumb. I always thought: ""why are they still my friend"" because I have self esteem issues.

Well I finally called them today and we had a small conversation. I felt a lot of anxiety being lifted off my chest afterwards even if the conversation was painfully awkward. We're going to see each other again later this week.

This may not seem like much but it's a lot for me. So yay. I hope that everyone else who has extreme social anxiety like me is able to have these small moments of victory in the huge war we have against our anxious thoughts."
928,Afraid I might be developing something....,"Title says it all. I’m really afraid I might be developing schizophrenia /develop it in the future. My grandfather (on dads side) has it, and so do my two uncles (moms side) and my mother has a personality disorder. 

Ever since I was young I remember being very scared and paranoid of having my thoughts read and influenced, and I’ve never felt safe (even in my own mind). I’m also highly paranoid of other people and institutions in general. I know no ones probably gives a shit about me but I always feel like I’m being attacked and everyone is looking at me and can see right through me and wants to hurt me. Everyone hates me and I don’t know why. They all want to kill me and I don’t know why. They don’t but that’s what comes to my head. It literally feels like the world is out to get me, with no logical basis behind it. It’s gotten to the point where this belief is so strong I completely mishear what people are saying as it warps into scary thoughts of mine.
For example, I was at work and my coworker tapped me on the shoulder and I heard her say “they’re angry with you, you know?” My heart skipped a beat and I asked her to repeat it again only for her to ask me something completely unrelated to what I heard. I was with my friend in the mall and all of a sudden she says “that girl over there told me she hates you.” And it was a girl we never met, but that’s what I heard even though she told me she said something else.
It’s very scary that I’m hearing these negative thoughts coming from other people and I feel crazy. I find myself engaging in really reckless fucking behavior and wanting to get into arguments for the sake of it even though I’m a very non confrontational person. I have crazy thoughts all the time and my entire life feels like a perpetual Kenya tower just falling and falling and falling and falling and crashing and breaking and collapsing. I should note that I have c-ptsd, depression, autism, and a myriad of other shit. I’ve never received therapy and have no coping skills so this dysfunctional life is sadly normal to me. I’m afraid I’m slipping and I don’t know how to stop. Shame keeps me from ever bringing this up to my family or doctor. I don’t want to be institutionalized. I don’t know what to do."

930,Okay so I need some advice,"Whenever I think about my problems, I cant cry but I get extremely nauseous, so that's something. I just suppress that shit down immediately after. Infact, it takes a long time to dig them back up! Just... help?"
931,Any Vets With Advice?,"So, I am a person who has experienced MTS. I have PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, and BPD. I’ve heard a lot of bad about the VA Healthcare when it comes to mental health. A doctor really suggested it (I haven’t slept more that 3-4 hrs in 7 years) but I just don’t want another bad experience, which made me quit therapy to begin with and kind of recluse into myself. 
I’ve got a kid, a daughter. A supportive husband. They need me to get better. If it’s not good, I might try the local vet center because I’ve heard good things. But she strongly recommended meds to help even me out."
932,What’s wrong with me? Can a therapist really help my issues?,"I’ve hit a point where my mental health is starting to worry me. I need to know if something is wrong with me. I know I need to see a therapist or something but I can’t get up the willpower to do so 

My memory is in shambles, I can’t remember much of anything past a few days ago. Except for very important or sad events. I even forget my name sometimes. 

Ive started calling everything by the wrong name multiple times before I get it right. Like I’ll call a microwave a fridge, then a toaster, then eventually get to the word microwave. That happens for most things. Stairs turns into elevators and what not

I feel like the magic is gone from everything and I can’t feel real excitement, even the day before a major event. I know I should and want to feel excited but I just feel neutral. I don’t enjoy things I used to love

Today is the first time in 3 years that I’ve looked at myself through a mirror in detail instead of trying to focus on shaving or brushing teeth. I didn’t even recognize myself. I used to look so young, but now I look old and tired after such a short time. I don’t hate how I look, it’s just that I see the disappointment of a person that everyone in my family tells me I am and I begin to hate myself. (Not exaggerating. My family disowned me because they disapprove of me being an online merchant instead of working outside the home. Now only my brother talks to me)

I’ve been depressed for years but recently I became worried because I’m only 28 and can’t even remember my name from time to time or what I look like. What’s wrong with me? Could a therapist and medicine really make me feel anything but disappointment? Maybe even feel like things are exciting and enjoyable?

Sorry for the length, thank you in advance"
933,I'm tired of feeling this way.," I'm a 15 year old guy, growing up I was taught to be a rock, an unemotional thing that people can depend on. I'm tired of it, I feel like i need to break down to someone, but i can't. So i'm here to vent, I feel useless, when it comes to most things, not as smart as others my age but i feel i need to be so i can succeed and reach my parents expectations and don't feel like the mistake i feel i am. I have friends and family that i could talk to but i can't, I feel when people learn you are depressed, they look at you different, they try to block you out, and leave you behind and i can't stand the thought of being left behind. I'm a big guy, and it is easy to accidentally hurt those close to you, last year i was at a friends party, all was fine until a few people left and there was a spot next to 2 of my friends on a swing, they invited me to sit, and soon after the swing broke on the side i was sitting on, no one got hurt, but i went home, took a shower and in the shower i cried, i couldn't stand the thought of what could of happened, a rock could have busted their heads, at the time we had hot chocalate and they could have been burned badly. I understand it probaly doesn't sound right, but i'm trying to tell you all that bothers me in one post and my thoughts are all jumbled, sorry. 

TLDR: I have too many reasons to hate myself and no one i feel confident in venting to. 

A much clearer version of how i feel can be found if you look up on youtube Mel's thoughts, I'm Okay."
934,This is confusing the hell out of me,"Okay so my boyfriend has made it very clear that when he says this that he is only trying to help me, and that he isn’t blaming me or saying this is my fault. But I just can’t wrap my head around this. so this is the best way that I can explain what he told me “you have given  yourself more pain than your initial trauma gave you because your trauma caused you a lot of pain, but then you self harmed for years after that trauma happened so all of that self harm has accumulated over time and therefore has caused you more pain and suffering than the initial trauma” 

That’s the best way I can explain what he said to me. And Me and him have talked about this several
Times but no matter how hard I try I just can’t seem to understand what he means when he says this. I have tried to google things to try to find any articles that could help me understand this concept better but I have had no luck. can anyone try to break down what he is saying so that I can maybe understand it better?"
935,I tend to feel the need to replace the people I've lost and try to live out their existence as if I've never lost them.,"My siblings, mainly. Though I've tried doing it with other people like my ex. I know it's rather predatory to hang out with little kids as a full-functioning adult- but I can't help it. I love seeing them be themselves, doing all kinds of weird shit kids do. Seeing them be so naive. Sometimes I wish I coould confront one of them and invite them over to my house, cooking them  yummy meal and have them sleep over so I could read them a bed-time story. I miss it.. I dont think anyone knows how I feel. I didn't *lose* my siblings, they are still out there. Alive, maybe not for long. They're stuck with my abusive family. My oldest brother.. I'ts just.. I DONT FUCKING KNOW. 

FUCK you.. Honestly. WHat a fucking pedophile I hope he gets torn apart and his organs scattered. What a fucking monster. **They probably think I abandoned them.** I didn't MEAN to leave like that, I didn't want to.. But when your mom suddenly acts fucking psycho like that, you have no choice. I hate it so much. I want to rip out my eyes =, rip off every body part i fucking have IT ISNT FAIR. Sissie left you! Sissie doesnt 'care' about you. I bet thats what my mom told them. Shes a selfish bitch.

&amp;#x200B;

I want someone to shoot up a CPS office. Set them all on fire. they dont fucking care and they are responsible for all the pain in peoples lives. it isnt fair... they need to be gassed, i want their families to know theyre all murderers and apologists. im gonna laugh when that finally happens, itll be a fucking holiday seeing all the employees there **die.** thats what they get.. i want them all dead. no amount of anything will get my childhood back and will remove any trauma from my siblings. i hope theyre ok... i care so much, i never wanted to leave them. this is all my fault. i shouldve stayed there and dealt with the shit longer but wtf what would that done... fuckers dont CARE, **CPS DONT CARE.**"
936,I’m 20. Can any therapist give one therapy session online for $45? I can’t afford more than that because I’m a student. Something is bothering me and I just don’t know how to open up to old friends anymore.,
937,Anyone ever feel like there is something else up?,"  

By this I mean, for example, me; I’ve been diagnosed with all types of anxiety and depression as well. Yet, I feel like there is more than I can understand and recognize with my issues of the previous. For the most part I can overcome them but there is this nagging side of my brain that I can’t take. Its something that even nagged when on medication. It sucks as an adult I am open the therapy but I can’t afford it like many of us :/ 

Just left pondering in my already too full skull…"
938,"I don't know what's wrong with me, is it part of my autism?","Ever since I was 11 probably even younger, my depression started because I was unattractive and girls didn't like me. I saw other boys with girlfriends and I wanted one too. Fast forward today I'm even more depressed and I have triggers. Like even looking at a cute attractive girl my age or close to my age, seeing couples, youtube videos mentioning anything about sex, love, or romance in general, music is a big trigger because sooooooo many songs mention a girl. It's like a phase that comes in goes, it can last weeks. I get really really depressed, jealous, and envious. My only coping skill is listening to dark and heavy music.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know what to do. No one knows about this, I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone Irl.

Btw this is how my depression started when I was 11. Now at 18 I'm depressed about numerous things but this hurts the most. I think this has something to do with my autism. What else could it be?"
939,"How do you talk to someone who knows they need help, but shuts down every time it’s brought up?","I have a sister who’s really going through a rough time. At this point she’s technically in grade 11 but hasn’t been to school consistently in about a year. She was the hospital for suicide watch for two weeks and is now out. 

Basically she just lies on the couch watching tik tock videos and anime all day. That’s all she does besides take baths. 

I offer to help her get started on schoolwork and help her get set up with more online courses. She just rolls over and says not right now. 

My parents feel awful because they tried being strict parents, they tried being compassionate parents but neither worked. It seems like the bad side effects of both are prevalent. She’s emotionally unstable but also lazy to the point of being stuck on the couch and falling far behind in school.

If she stays like this she’ll be a lazy adult who can’t take care of herself. She says she understands the importance of school but refuses to do it. Even when it’s set up at home, by a peaceful fireplace, with ample nice people offering help.

How can I convince her to help herself and get out of this rut?"
940,How do I know I have problems?,"The question written above is not exactly that I want to know. I want to know how a psychiatrist or therapist derive that I have problems.
They solely depend on my answers to their questions or they make observations about me while sessions doing different activities, questions; listening to the answer which I don't directly give through my answers.or they see through me and know this person did this in that scenario means he/she should have x,y or z problem and from there they narrow it down to the core issue.

The reason I am asking this question is because I think I might have some problems.but I am not sure that they are legit mental difficulties or I am using them as an excuse consciously or unconsciously for my recent failures.i am saying that because I overthink pretty much everything and my mind can manipulate and project something else than what I am feeling.


Little background:
       This issues are coming out as I am horribly failing at my college.not as per grades but as per studies,skills, knowledge perspective.i am in last year of my graduation at age 21 and don't know what I am good at,what I am interested in,I just want to be shut in one room and watch movies and YouTube videos only.i have bunked three days in row in college.when I am out of college my family depends on me so there is so much pressure from that point of view.i was ace student once never saw anything less then 1st rank and suddenly i am good at nothing and can't trust my self on doing anything.till 10th grade I aced my classes like nobody's business and from the end of 10th grade through 11th and 12th and through college I am till suffering.i don't know what the problem is.i can't afford therapy sessions for too long.and I haven't gone for them also.
        So before I go I want to know that I have issues and they can be solved within given time as I have left with few months to finish my college.

I can write all the things here but it will be too long to read.so ask me if any missing piece of info you want to find out.
I might have multiple points of failure."
941,I feel better when I’m sleep deprived,I feel more confident and carefree maybe it’s because I don’t have hw energy so be anxious!
942,Is something wrong with me?,"For context I’m 21 M. Diagnosed with depression and medicated for it so it really doesn’t affect me. 

I have always felt like I’ve been kind of an outlier as far as human relationships go and my personal life but I could never figure out what was causing it. 

I live a fairly normal life. I am a college student (close to graduation), have a gorgeous girlfriend who for the most part I’m happy with, have parents who have been together since I was born, not rich/not poor, have a fairly large social circle - the “average” life that people live as far as normal circumstances go. I objectively have no reason to be unhappy for dissatisfied with my life at all. In fact I feel like I have every reason to be happy with life. 

With all of these things that many people would be happy with, I still find myself unhappy with my life. And it isn’t like I’m dissatisfied with myself as a person to drag myself down. I’m insecure about a few insignificant things, but who isn’t insecure about something? It all isn’t major in my mind. 

For instance, when I’m with my girlfriend (who I really have no reason to dislike or not want to be with at all) I always find my brain telling me I would be happy with someone else. This has happened with different people, also, so it isn’t like it’s just my current girlfriend not being the “one” for me. Ever since I started dating seriously, which was about 6 years ago, I haven’t found myself relatively happy with one of my girlfriends. Obviously these girls have become more and more serious with every one that I’ve dated so it isn’t to say that I’m not learning what I want and don’t want in a forever partner and I would say I have a fairly firm grasp on what I want and don’t want by now - at least for the most part at least. When I’m single I feel as if I want a certain girl because of X and Y quality about them while keeping in mind of all of the qualities that I didn’t like about my exes but then when I finally get around to being exclusive and dating said person I get the feeling that I don’t want to be with them no matter how smart, funny, pretty, easygoing, or any combination of the qualities they have are. I always find myself thinking about what’s next on the list and it honestly breaks my heart knowing that I’m going to hurt them. I do love my girlfriend as I have loved each of my past partners but no matter how in love with them I am I can’t bring myself to just be happy with them, which is what hurts me because I truly care about them as individuals and partners but I’m always thinking of being with other partners as well. It feels as if something has been missing the whole time. 

Or in life, I always find myself thinking that there’s much more to what I should be experiencing than what I’m feeling. Throughout my whole life I have always had friends and a caring support system to carry me through life so it isn’t as if I was ever alone in my life. Even still, I feel like I’m unable to unlock the next level of happiness no matter how hard I try. I went to college strictly to find this next level of satisfaction of accomplishing something on my own but now that I see the light at the end of the tunnel I feel as if it’s not significant at all. Even in school, I’ve always has mentors who have guided me along and made me feel as if what I was doing was great. They all preached about “finding your purpose” and “doing what you love” and I feel as if what I do in school and life makes me happy, but it doesn’t mean I necessarily am passionate or love what I’m doing. I just feel as if it’s something I’m doing to pass the time or to get the obstacle over with. And then after that, what’s next? The next unexciting challenge that I’ll inevitably overcome just like the others in my life? It’s all a cycle to me that’s repetitive and melancholic to me. 

I try everything in the books to make my life as exciting as possible. I have traveled to different countries, I’m engaged in classes and extracurriculars, I’ve taken up different hobbies such as music and skiing, I go out with friends fairly often as well as spending time with my girlfriend on a pretty regular basis. I really feel as if I live an extremely satisfying life all-around, but I always feel as if I’m falling short of true happiness - which pretty sums up my whole point. I’ve begun to think something is wrong with me because most people would be extremely happy with the life I live. Is something wrong with me? Or is it just part of growing up? I feel like nothing is going to change for me and I really just want an outsiders opinion on this."

944,How can I fix all I’m feeling,"I’m an exchange student and I’ve been away from my home country for 8 months now. The first 3 months were literally the best months of my life with new people and everyone being so incredibly interested in me and nice to me.

However. 3 months and 25 days into my stay I was contacted by my mom who said my grandma’s cancer had gotten worse and that the doctors didn’t know how much time she had left. She’s had cancer for almost all my life, but because they caught it so early they had been able to keep it in check for 15+ years, I didn’t even know she had cancer until about 4 years ago.

3 months and 28 days into my stay I talked to my parents again and they basically told me that she had decided to stop her treatment and “let things go as they go” as she put it herself. She died exactly 2 months after that phone call.

I it’s been almost 4 months since she died and I still can’t get over it. I really have tried making myself talk to someone about it, but I don’t want to feel like I’m trying to make someone feel bad for me. There is literally 2 people in the whole US that are aware my grandma died and they don’t even know it’s recent. 

I feel angry with her because she pulled out of the treatment and dooming the little chance I ever had of seeing her again. I feel angry with my parents for not telling me about it earlier. I feel angry with God for taking her in the way he took her and taking her while I was literally on the other side of the world. But most importantly I am so incredibly angry and disappointed in myself for not spending more time with her while I was still at home and not being able to swallow my pride and call her more than once a week after she stopped treatment because I was angry with my parents.

Normally I would just pray it all away, but this event alone has made me agnostic. I really cannot comprehend how and all-mighty and merciful god could allow this to happen. But she’s gone now and I have to accept it.

Does anyone have any tips on how to get over something like this? When my grandpa died it felt so much easier. I was very sad for a couple days, a little sad for a gone and then I felt like I moved on, but now it’s like I have this sadness constantly hanging over me and it doesn’t get any better with time. Maybe I’ll feel better when I get to go home again, idk."
945,You are Not Alone..,"At the end of the day, we are all the same. We are all broken by our past, childhood experiences, our varied backgrounds/upbrings or maybe by our poor decisions or just living life. We fight different mind battles, we are challenged by the fear of the unknown, discouragement, despair and doubt. We struggle in various areas of our lives and there are times when we wonder if we can even catch a break. We give our best and yet it seems like nothing is shifting or changing. Everything around us seems like its failing- our relationships, jobs, and ourselves.

We are all the same at the end of the day. It doesn't matter what educational, economic, social, gender differences exist. It is so easy to think if we had more money then we would be better. Yes, money is great but why do we have so many seemingly successful people taking their lives? If you are reading this, I encourage you to find gratitude where you stand.

946,Opinions on Taking a Mental Health Day,"What are your opinions on taking a mental health day from work/ school? What if you live in a place where mental health issues, like anxiety,  aren't treated seriously? Are you comfortable faking or somewhat exaggerating an illness to take a day off? Do you feel guilt for lying? Do you feel like a rat bastard? 

A little background on my question:

I had trouble sleeping at night last week (4.5-6.5 hours a night), possibly as a result of high stress incurred over the two weeks preceeding it. My meditation, journaling, and exercise routines broke down. I had difficulty ""eating my frog"" in the morning (I wake up at 4:30 and start on my M.I.T.s. by 5:40-6:00). I had some diarrhea on Wednesday evening of that week and had a gum graft procedure on Friday evening.

Now, as it so happens, I monitor my emotions with respect to depressive and anxiety and record them when I am regular with journaling. I had noticed that relapse was about to occur. So, I had decide to take Sunday completely off (usually I plan the upcoming week on Sundays) and made another Reddit account to ask for support on r/depression_help.

Unfortunately, I received no responses to that post. I tried to cope by helping other posters the best I could with their issues, complimenting them, offering them long pieces of tailored advice (unlike the usual platitudes), following up with them, etc.  I also spent time with and helped three of my friends who were going through some shut of their own. But after a while, my plans for the week slowly broke down and I achieved few of my weekly goals. 

This week, I decided to use the excuse of the gum graft to take some time off of college and my project (it's a team thing. I hold my own and do good work on it.). I felt that my teammates could handle the next task in 2-3 days without me. (I didn't tell them about the stress.). I used the excuse of the my mouth hurting. Which wasn't exactly a lie; the anchors of the palate stent have cut my upper lip and the hole in its middle has cut my tongue. The injuries ain't big but they hurt like bitches. The graft itself only hurts while eating, drinking, and brushing. The soft/ liquid meals I've been eating have tended to be high in protein (milk and eggs) and high fiber giving me crazy smelly flatulence and a little bit of bloating. I've been sleeping better this week, except for last night, and have been finishing off all my backlogged work so that I can get to studying for my midterms in a couple of weeks and program the implementation of the next part of our system. Now, it turns out that my pals did absolutely nothing over the past four days and now wanted me to go help with this task (it's modifying a survey paper which for which I helped on the first draft, staying up till midnights and 1:00 A.M. while having a lot of other shot to do and suffering from high chronic anxiety. I also wrote out a plan to off myself if I failed as a backup but shelved it to revisit in a few months.) I tried, subtly, to ask if I could handle the programming part instead, which has a later deadline. My homeboy couldn't take a hint so I said that my mouth's still hurting and that I'm having trouble sleeping. He accepted that excuse. 

Now, I feel like a lying sack of shut, which I am. I am struggling more with mental health than physical, but I doubt that they'd accept that. I just need a week to finish all my other shit and do a lot more coding to feel better and to build momentum. Do you think that I'm in the wrong here?"
947,I Need Useful Information on Self-Harm,I have a good friend who self-harms and I am trying to help her do some research. All I can find is essentially the same article over and over again. If you do self-harm or used to would you mind sharing your feelings on it? Or if you have a good article on it?  I think she is feeling alone and I know she isn't.
948,i just need some help aha,"Hey, so I'm not gonna go into too many specifics for personal reasons. I hope you understand and I appreciate it. Thank you :) 

I know this is mental health-related but I'm not exactly sure what happened? I have a past of mental health issues, but I'm poorly educated about mental health. If that makes sense?? hah I'm not sure. 

To put it simply, I had a short amount of time to do something that needed a lot of time. I almost immediately got extremely overwhelmed and started crying. This is not typical of me because I'm good at keeping it together when it is necessary hah. (in this situation it was necessary :/) This just continued to escalate to a point where I would start hyperventilating, I was able to calm myself down, but I would just start hyperventilating again. This happened 3 times in about 10-15 minutes?? (i can't remember clearly) For the most part, I could almost calm myself all the way down and almost stop crying. But almost as soon as I got calmed down it would start again and it would escalate again. During this time I was still trying in vain to get this task done, I was basically running around in circles doing nothing. It felt like my brain turned off. I started shaking and getting very weak so I couldn't move the things I needed to move, I was able to move one little thing. I inevitably dropped it and that was my breaking point. After that, I stopped trying to calm myself down, but I was still trying to do the task. My mom tried to hug me, but idk it was like my brain was off I couldn't hug her back, I couldn't speak. I was just hysterical and just stood there. Someone made a comment right after my mom hugged me and I started screaming and crying and I couldn't stop, I couldn't think. I sat to the floor and just couldn't stop screaming and crying. My hands were just grabbing at everything and it felt as if I had gone brain dead and my body was just?? I don't even know what I was thinking at this moment, idk if I even was or if I cant remember. It felt like whole minutes I was just sitting on the floor like this. It was the scariest, most weird experience ever and I never want to experience it again. Idk what happened but I would like to avoid something like this happening again. 

Im sorry this is kinda long"
949,I'm getting a bankruptcy and struggling with feeling like I've failed,"I have depression, which I know can make things seem worse than they are, but I think a bankruptcy is a pretty objective sign of failure. It wasn't even because of something outside of my control, like medical bills. I was living outside of my means and then I took a chance on a sales type of job where you might make a lot of money but there's no guaranteed paycheck. The job didn't work out and I stuck with it way too long while I was paying bills with credit cards. 

Even now I feel like I should have figured out a way to try to pay the debt off instead of getting a bankruptcy, but tbh life wouldn't be worth it for me if I had to make the kinds of changes that would require. I'm already down to a standard of living that most people wouldn't be okay with. No wifi, no tv, my fridge doesn't even work. Bankruptcy seems like the smarter choice, but it's not one I'll ever be proud of.

Is this as big of a deal as I think it is?"
950,How do I know whether I really need mental help or not?,"Hello everyone,

Recently I have been struggling a lot. I just graduated and have started with a new job. However, this is not where I want to be. I know what I want. I know what I need to do to get it. But I simply cannot put my words into action.

On weekdays I work, eat, netflix and sleep. Weekends are boring. Everyone around me seems to enjoy what they have but I simply cannot find happiness in anything even though I am in a better position than them.

My parents are unhappy with me, everyone has lost faith in me. I was always a bright student. But I don't know what changed in last 2-3 years that I could not even do well in my exams. I was am avid reader, a great dancer a good painter but I don't want to do those things too. I used to love to try new food joints around the city but now I don't even eat 2 meals a day properly. I am gaining weight. I have become very obsessed with how I look.

I once read a book ""Life is what you make it"". In that book, the female character experenced something similar. She was the brightest students during her MBA but she later had a breakdown and could not even read comics. I fear is this something which is going to happen to me too ?

I want to get out of this slumber but I don't know how. I know only crying over these problems won't help and I have to start taking actions. Nobody is going to help myself but me. I know what is wrong and what I need to do. I know everything. Yet, I can't. I am always there for my friends and give them the best advise. But I cannot seem to get my own life on track."
951,I was told by a military therapist that I have “muted emotions” can anyone give me more insight?,"Ok, this will be long as its kinda my life story so I apologize and thank you in advance for reading this!

I am a 25 year old male. 195 lbs. I recently got out of the military and moved back home.

Ive always thought of myself as different. Let me explain.

Ever since I can remember I would see the ""sad"" moments on the tv shows my parents would watch and I after they went to bed I would play their cds until I found a sad sounding song like the song played during the sad tv scene and I would pretend I was in that moment and make myself cry. I would then feel so accomplished because I pretended to feel what I never felt. I never felt sad or hurt like that but pretending I was like that made me feel normal.

Even before that time I got to admit to three things that I've not told anyone, not even my wife. 1. I have a memory of my dog having puppies when I was around five... I would take them individually and ""stress"" them out in different ways because their reactions were fascinating. Please don't lecture me on this as I feel horrible and wish I could take it back every day. 2. Again I'm ashamed to say this and that's why I am on a throw away, but, while I was being babysat I would approach the youngest child, sometimes baby, there and do the same. If it ended with the child crying, it was very easy for me to draw a innocent and blank face when the sitter came. 3. When I was around 4 I had sexual experiences with my step father. While my mother was at work he would take me to his bedroom and preform oral sex on me and have me preform oral on him. I always thought to myself that he was sleep walking but I cannot say for sure. I don't think about it a lot and I honestly have made an effort to block it out. This happened before the other two so maybe I should of said it first but oh well, again I've never told a single soul any of this.

Growing up I struggled to meet norms in family settings. I was scolded for being ""bored"" and not crying at funerals. I was told I upset my parents because I have never, even as an adult, shown ""excitement"" during Christmas or for any gift/special event. I recently tried to open up about this to my father and I got cold feet and didn't saw much but he stated that he has always seen it.

My wife is the only relationship I've had for more then 6 months. We have struggled. During down times she has presented me with divorce papers. As much as I don't want that to happen... as much as I tell myself I care about her.. it doesn't hurt or upset me. Honestly I don't care. Ive made her cry and I don't feel anything. The only thing that makes me prevent a divorce is I don't want to loose her for her income and her help around the house. Sad right ? She's told me I'm cold, heartless and insane. But idk what to think. I feel numb all the time, like no matter how hard I try I can't connect with anyone.

The only real feeling I know Is strong anger and or a itching desire to go crazy. Im sure that sounds silly but I mean Im constantly bombarded with ""intrusive thoughts"" like what would happen if I just stabbed everyone here? would it be exciting. What would happen if I strangled my sleeping wife??? Don't get me wrong I don't want to but I think about it. I truly don't think I know what love really feels like.

Ive always been rebellious, doing stupid things causing me to have 8 large scars over my body and face due to injuries from my risky behavior.

Since around 17, when I started drinking, I've struggled with drinking too much and relying on alcohol to make me feel normal around people.

I can make friends easy because I've learned to just replicate their behavior. I prefer my showers and food scalding hot.

When I was in the military I had a pre deployment screening in which my answers made the medical staff forward me to a therapist. We only had one meeting before I got out. I only told her a fraction of what I've said here and she said I suffer from ""muted emotions"", possibly on the sociopathic spectrum.  Is it possible to be semi emotionless??? She asked me to keep talking to her after I got out but I panicked and didn't continue communication. I struggle with over thinking.

I can't talk to anyone about this in my life. Can you please help. Thank you again. Also if you have any other question I will happily answer them."
952,I feel like shit,"My sister suffering from psychosis came completely uncalled today to visit from her mental hospital (with permission). I dont wanna see her and be reminded of the state shes in. She has delusions about a hacker stalker boy following her on every device, and now apparently in real life too. She told me that he is now a patient at her hospital because he wanted to see her. The way she talked about him appearing before her was like it was just something funny that happened."

954,Data for depression - A new approach,"Hi folks, hope you are doing alright. I am working on a new project to find markers from data that can reduce the risk of depression . Perhaps, help people to find what can help them fight depression! It would be great if you can help this initiative by filling the below survey (of course, anonymously). Please share this to your friends and family who you think might be suffering from depression.

955,Inner voice is really loud.,Sometimes my inner monologue or inner voice has a sensation of being really loud. Like it’s amplified or the volume of it has been turned up. It makes me anxious and uncomfortable. I’m scared that I have mild schizophrenia because of this. It reminded me that a couple years ago I used to hear screaming in my head when I was upset and it wouldn’t stop. Sometimes my voice will talk in my head really loud but it’ll be scary or sad things. It’s only my voice.
956,small things feel like big things,"i'm so burnt out lately. like i'm not getting sex, not getting a break, don't feel that unbreakable willpower i had 4 years ago while doing my studies. so swamped with school full-time, and the task of finding a job + just real world stuff.. and i feel defective that that's all it takes to shut me down. i do what i have to do, get through the day, but even small things are starting to take on an obligatory feel. literally putting cheese away in the fridge, wiping the crumbs off the table, opening a f\*cking door again and again, caring after my body, washing it, even walking from point a to b in my house--i don't even want to reach out to my friends anymore, i want everyone to leave me alone. i do things with this panicked urgency that sits in my chest and tenses my shoulders. i find it hard to take my time, do things at a peaceful pace. honestly, i don't wanna do anything.

at the same time i demand productivity, optimize myself and the time i have--i guess healthy people would call this basic time management lol. it's like, because everything feels like such a big expenditure of energy, it's work.. and because i don't have too much going on, maybe this is my way of convincing myself i *am* doing *something*.. that i'm not wasting away--because that's how i really feel. my mental health days: yoga, writing, reading, going for a swim, furniture shopping, go out into the city, that's all work for me. I HATE MENTAL ILLNESS. i'm so bitter at those who are healthy. i wouldn't wish this upon anyone. i just want what others have. wonder who i could've been without this."
957,"I keep seeing things wrong with me that I think are new, but they're not","Hey guys,

I'm not sure what's wrong with me but as stated above I keep thinking new things are wrong with my appearance that aren't new at all. I've noticed it happens mostly with my teeth.

For example, I just saw the lower part of my teeth where there is some slight overcrowding and when I looked at it tonight it looked so much worse, really bad, like one of my teeth had risen up further and pokes out worse. When this happens I feel my heart sink and panic and get scared, somewhat suicidal. I pulled up some old pictures of my teeth to realise they were always like that, no change at all, but it feels so real. 

Before this I thought I noticed that my front teeth had moved and one stuck out more than it did before and was now really badly aligned, but it turned out again this did not happen.

The time before that I had a chip I thought was new and it ruined my mood for like 3 days before I started to recover mentally. 

I don't know why my brain thinks new things are wrong with my teeth all the time... like I literally think WTF when did that happen omg its horrible and it'll be something that's been the same for like 20 yrs. 

Does this have a name or has any one else experienced it?"
958,"If a Sociopath is found to out by society, what happens to that sociopath, is there any process or procedure for it?","I have been studying sociopaths to a mild degree and I am aware that not all are violent, but even if they haven't done anything the potential damage must be enough to trigger something right?"
959,"As I get older I feel like I’m noticing my mind is changing like I feel like I’m slowly loosing it. It could just be my anxiety, but I feel like I’m watching someone else live my life.",

961,Maybe this is the place for this??,
962,Anybody else struggling with a lifetime of high functioning behaviour and mental illness?,"The past few weeks I've just been thinking about what it would be like if my high functioning habits did not exist. My mental illness definitely hinders every single thing I want to do, but being driven before facing mental health issues, has had this weird effect on me now. 

On one hand, it puts too much pressure on everything I do. ""I could do this so much better"" ""why am I not doing it the way I did it before"" ""I was so successful and look at me now"". And this crazy urge to just be perfect at what I'm doing. 

On the other hand, it helps me push when I feel a bit better. There's this sense of urgency and hard motivation to do it. It brings me back in the zone and makes me strive hard towards success.

I think being high functioning is the only way I've managed to somehow do alright in life. But there's obviously an up and down thing with motivation. Feels like being high functioning is a blessing and a curse. 

Does anybody else feel this way?"
963,I can’t stop isolating myself from my family.,"I want to speak with them more. I want to do more things with them. I want to have a laugh with them, but I can’t. 

It’s better for them that I do this so I don’t upset them when I get irritated and make a comment to make them feel bad. I hate myself for it, I have to let it out, but then it makes me feel even worse afterwards. I hope they know it’s not the real me and it’s whatever’s wrong with me. 

I am gonna regret this so much in the future. My mum is unwell she’s doing good at the moment, but could take a turn for the worst at anytime, I hope and pray it’s not soon. 

I wish things were different :("

966,What I've learned from my own experiences and from clients about burnout,"Hello Everyone, today I wanna share with you the 3 ways people usually deal with Burnout and the long lasting solution to it:  


**#1) Changing the environment**

The go to with this approach is: Move to a different environment, different job, start your own business or changing the employer.

Unfortunately (most of the time) you'll find yourself in the same situations and scenarios again sooner or later because you are moving WITH your internal problems.

That's because with this approach you are only addressing the parts that are not always 100% in your control and you are moving WITH your internal problems.  


**#2) Lock-in approach**

You are in a ""stuck-phase"" and decide to improve everything you can. You are telling yourself: ""Well, I've got good benefits in what I’m doing (money, career, promotion, etc.) and this distress will probably soon go away by itself. I might as well stay here and I don't want to start all over again.""

Go to’s: New Hobbies, New friends and depending on the level of severity: anti-depressants or other forms of medication.

Adressed: Sympthoms. Not addressed: The cause of the problem!

I myself lost the most time and energy with this approach and want to . Probably that's also the reason why I'm sometimes really upset about some posts that go round online. Please save yourself the expenses, time and troubles with this one.  


**#3) Transformational Change**

While this is probably the hardest approach, and not easy for everyone, it is the only way to get free of it (for good).

With this approach you have to be open to question yourself, the situation you are in and the way that brought you to where you are at right now.

In most cases there are some deeper underlying issues that have never been addressed yet.

With this process you need to turn around and face the problems you’ve been running away from for too long.

I know that it doesn't sound like a pleasant quick-fix solution... But what's the alternative?

In hindsight, I don't regret any second with this one and the rewards are huge. After my personal breakthrough it was like a haze that suddenly disappeared. I felt free like I didn't for years!

I really want to encourage you to take approach #3!  


If you have any questions about it, feel free to comment below or send me a DM.   
Hope you get some value from it."
967,Having trouble with communication,"I can’t help but to be in my head during conversations. What I’m noticing from my peers body language is that they sense an indecency coming from me. 

People often turn the other cheek on me. I know it’s because of me on the outside but more about how I’m coming off. Tone, speed of delivery.. all of that is F’d up for me.

Some days I REALLY feel like what I stated above has been my life story. I don’t get calls from people cause I’m not very well liked or at least befriended by other people. Other days, I’m just used to it. I suppose it’s just a hard day. Just wanted to vent. Thanks for reading"
968,Mental illnesses becoming physical illness?,"Am I the only one who deals with this? 

I have GAD and CPTSD. Growing up, I've also had GERD (hyperacidity). 

Every time I get stressed out, my acidity acts out and leaves me completely helpless. I can't keep food down because of my need to throw up after meals. I'm sick again with fever today for the nth time this month.

My previous physician kept telling me to avoid stressful situations because once my anxiety kicks in, it just opens the floodgates to a variety of physical illnesses. 

I'm so pissed sometimes at myself because I can't control my anxiety all the time; when I don't, it always ends up making me extremely sick with a fever (like today). Add this on top of my anxiety also triggering my GERD, making it harder for me to actually eat to get better.

Life just sucks sometimes."
969,I was struggling with grief,"so set up [Untangle](https://l.linklyhq.com/l/1qb) \- it's a platform to support people grieving. You can be matched with 5-10 people who understand and have experienced something similar. Chat with them, a bereavement specialist, and experts."
970,Mental health is overlooked,"Now I’m not trying to be an overly emotional being but it’s very triggering to hear that the general population overlooks people that suffer from some sort of mental illness simply because it’s trendy right now. I think it’s unfair to those that have/are going through things and are open about it. I do believe it’s in a heightened trend right now but you can’t count it out for almost everyone. It sucks to hear that after going through it and still having episodes, people like my own family believes it’s fake. Not sure if it’s simply lack of knowledge/experience on their side. But I do believe people need to be more considerate. I don’t want to say my or anyone else’s issues/diagnosis should be compared. But you have to distinguish the authentic ones vs non authentic ones. And often times every mental issue is marked as disingenuous and misunderstood. Thoughts?"
971,I found my high school billy's home address,"The title says it.  I have it, street number and all. Im half decided on mailing a 'dicksbymail' confetti launcher to him, but im not sure if thats good enough. I tried to kill myself three times cause of him. 

Should i post his address somewhere and let the reddit denizens have their way with him?

Should i prank him myself?"
972,I feel useless without my job and never thought that would be me.,"I’ve been studying psychology and counselling for 5 years part time. I’ve been working retail jobs the whole time, just waiting and hoping that I’ll get a job which is in line with my passions.

9 months ago I got a job in the probation service delivering groups to service users. I was so happy when I got it, but standing in front of people brought out my social anxiety. I started getting anxious before work, then afterwards. I felt all of a sudden I was anxious all the time about work, study, just everything.

I was driving into work one day and just broke down in tears. Then the next week I had a panic attack going in to work. I took time off sick and started taking an SSRI.

I got back to work 2 weeks later and I’ve been working so hard on trying to be able to manage my anxieties and be good at the job. I thought I was getting somewhere.

Yesterday I had my probation review and was told I’m not being kept in the role and have been given a weeks notice.

I feel like shit, not because I have a mortgage to pay for. But I keep thinking about how I’m going to get a job I don’t care about now. Whilst still being very aware that my old job brought out anxieties and mental health struggles.

I’m so conflicted and still dealing with the shock of it all and likely grieving it. I never thought I’d care about a job so much, I think it made me increase my self worth."
973,Looking up NSFW in first grade,"I don't know what made me so interested in sex and naked images at such a young age. I am hoping this sub would be able to shed light on what the cause might be. \[20M\]

   In first grade my dad would regularly let me use his work laptop for games. I remember one night I took his laptop into my room before dinner and just started googling for NSFW pictures of females my age... i was 7. SOOOO yeah totally almost got my dad fired or arrested if anyone would've looked at his search history.  In these searches real porn would pop up in the google images and I have this one picture of a girl with a monster cock in her mouth but all of the mans body was out of frame so she just had this huge meat stick in her mouth covered in excrement. I was so puzzled for the life of me i could not figure out what that was she was eating. I remember not being aroused by these images, i was just idk curious? 

  After many nights like these I ended up telling my dad what I had done in private, he wasn't mad just wanted to have a talk with me later (birds&amp;bees). We had the talk and i couldn't wrap my mind around the idea of what the would even be like. I was a innocent kid so my mind never thought that way until naturally around 5th grade. After my dad finding out I wouldn't dare attempt looking up those types of images for another few years nor was I even that intrigued with them. 

   What brings me here is to ask if these are signs of sexual abuse? I have read things that say when a child is interested in sex at a very young age it is a potential sign of abuse. I have tried dusting off old memories but nothing of this caliber stands out in my head, but it was also nearly 14 years ago. I would love some help I've been so scared these last few months that might be what caused my habit at that age."
974,TW?,i relapsed and i feel like a failure. i have a doctors appointment later today but idk if i can bring myself to go
975,When I get lonely I get depressed then I don't react well to people not wanting to hang out,"I go to a small sized University, and my friends are busy people and so am I. the problem is I get lonely really easily and then when people just want to curl up at night and not hang I react badly and push them away."
976,My journey,"So it's been a long road fight g my depression but last year I finialy decided to get professional help. Along side with excellent university counciling I was taking anti depressents.

I will say that gp's are OK for the initial time, it wasn't until I had seen a psychiatrist that I really.became better. The initial dose for antidepressents/SSRI meds is about 20mg, which is good to see how you react to it but 60mg is a therapeutic dose and actually made me grow. 

I say this because I have been on daily meds for over a year now and after trying 3 different types (sertraline, metrazapine and fluoxetine) I have  finally found one that works for me. 

The last month has been perticularly had as my psychiatrist has been taking me off the other 2 and starting a 40mg dose of fluoxetine going up to 60mg. You all know how hard it is to change meds over. 

Now I have adjusted to the changes I finialy feel better. I am making my freinds laugh and that pesky negative voice  is visiting less and less frequesntly. 


While studying psychology I have been a little scetched out when we have been looking into  depression research as it does tend to feel a bit to real. But this is just the start of my journey. After seeing the dark place I have a burning conviction to dedicate my life to helping others with depression. There may be uncurtianty in this world but the dark place is real and fucking horrible.

Good luck to all of you with your journey to recovery ✌️"
977,Halting hallucinations?,"Grounding isnt working, what are other ways to stop hallucinations (audio and physical false sensations)."
978,"this person im kind of friends with posts too their snapchast story like every couple days and sometimes it saying stuff about negative things going on in their life and that their going through a rough time, and one time after their story they said how no one checked on them after the story...","so when they poste that i checked up on them and i always feel bad ignoring it but i dont know what advice to give too them, idk how im normally supposed to respond to those things."
979,My psychiatrist won’t actually HELP me,"Not sure if this is a result or reflection of her personal opinion or the way she was taught in schooling, but my psychiatrist is almost unwilling to hear me out and take what I feel and desire into consideration. I was under the impression that seeing a psychiatrist is a joint venture - however, she doesn’t hear me out about what I believe would help my mental health journey. I go to her appointment after appointment and tell her that I am still feeling the same way as the last and all she does is increase my dose of cymbalta. This drug does nothing for me, however she doesn’t “feel comfortable” putting me on anything else. Any time I try to advocate for myself, she shuts me down. I have severe anxiety and depression and I asked her for something to help me through panic attacks and she prescribed me 10 .5 mg ativan and refuses to give me more. She is more or less treating me like a drug abuse risk than a patient even when I voice that certain medications help me. Any time I try to ask to try something else, she says she “isn’t comfortable”. To make matters more irritating, she had me get tested for ADHD and the results came back that there’s a good chance I have it &amp; she refuses to medicate me for it. Why would you have me get tested for it if you refuse to help? Please let me know your thoughts. All psychiatrists can’t be like this. She has not actually helped me at all the whole time I have been seeing her."
980,Upsetting thoughts,"Everytime i’m out in public i get these sad thoughts, for example ‘everybody in this room is going to die one day’. I can’t help it, i even get them when i’m having fun. these thoughts really ruin the moment for me and make me feel very upset.

I know it isn’t an actual problem but do other people experience them?

How do i get rid of these thoughts?"
981,I need help and some advice and I’m scared,"So, I (17F) have been having anxiety for about 2 years, it’s not diagnosed and I think I’m having depression right now. I am trying to determine whether to talk to my school counsellor after a break of 2 months or not until I find a therapist which I think I need. Now my counsellor is great. He is kind and I am comfortable speaking with him except there is a part of me which  is making me not want to go talk to him. So here is a pro and con list. I would be really grateful if you all could help me decide. Please let me know if these points make sense or not. I’d really appreciate it. Also I’m kinda suicidal but I’m not going to tell him about it because he will call my parents. Now I am not going kill myself but I have the desire to die.  I’m so sorry that this is long, I could just really use some advice  

Reasons to go 
-I am really struggling in studies and have no motivation to do anything. Not even. Things I like like singing or dancing. Nothing  
- I get sad randomly. 
- I have been through this before and it was worse then now. I don’t want it to be like that again. 
- I have diabetes so the stress does physically affect me. 
-I don’t know who I am anymore  

Reasons not to go.  
- what if my counsellor (who is great) gets annoyed like my other counsellor. 
- what if I can’t be fixed and I can’t change myself, then the process will be a waste. 
- what if I get in trouble?"
982,I’m in love with my fake boyfriend,"Last year I created this fake boyfriend account, got him a decent amount of followers, and texted back and forth through his and my account to make it look like we’ve been talking. I know that by itself is pretty weird, but it keeps getting weirder. I created this whole backstory and personality for him and I even added him to a group chat with my friends so that they could interact with “him”. I talked about him everyday and we were “dating” for a year and a half and I felt like it went to far so I just told everyone that we broke up. I still think about him everyday and I talk about him often. My friends have texted him and they still keep in contact with him. It’s gotten so bad that sometimes I forget he’s fake for like half a second and then I’ll get sad when I realize. I’ve been dreaming about him and everything and as weird as it seems I think I’m in love with my fake boyfriend. Someone please help."
983,Repressed memories,"Possible trigger warning.

Is there a way to dig them up? I was molested for an extended period of time by the same person when I was in first grade. I remember bits and pieces of it, but I know there's much more to it. I have forgotten almost my entire childhood, but I remember it in small fragments. Mostly consisting of the bad parts of me growing up, molestation, physical, and emotional abuse. Why has my brain hidden so much of this from me? Is there a way to uncover this side of my memory so that I can work towards facing my problems and recovering from the trauma?"
984,Mental Health Tips for Nomads,I'm not sure if there are many nomads here but I wonder if there any tips you can share if you've been dealing with mental health issues while traveling long term. Who did you turn to and what helps you keep your head above water?

986,Going to the mental hospital,I’m in the army and my mental health isn’t the best.. I have a behavioral health apt Friday if I were to say that I wanted to kill myself what would happen what would that look like? Would I be killing my career. I think I need help and no one in my unit cares. They have things to worry about and I am not one of them... can someone enlighten me and help me understand what would happen if I said that I felt like I was going to kill myself? Please no judgement...
987,Need help,I am a university student (20 years of age).  Sometime I linger over one thing and sometime over another. I can't specialize in one as I can't stay motivated over one topic over  long. I like doing one thing one day and possibly  hate doing same task next day.  I am aware about these situation  but can't do anything.Is this a symptom of mood swing(Bipolar Disorder)? Can Bipolar Disorder be treated?
988,Mental hygiene tips,"Hi everyone, first time on here.

I recently discovered a TED talk on mental hygiene and it made so much sense but I have never thought about it.

Could anyone share mental health hygiene tips to prevent mental health decline that you guys use?

I can off the bat think of meditation but that's quite general.

I'm eager to hear any tips you guys have :)"
989,Indiana/US - Can I tell a therapist my friend very rarely harms themselves without them being committed? What if they've been a past patient there too?,"My friend cuts herself when she's very very upset. I've only known her to do it once, and I triggered it. I know there was another episode before I met her.

It's part of my own healing that I convey the full story but my friend has a job and life and would never forgive me if I got her committed."
990,"Searching for Scientifically Supported Methods to improving Mental Well-being, Health, and overall Happiness","I am looking for scientifically supported guidelines, hits and tips for Mental Well-being, Health, and overall Happiness.
Overall, I am not unhappy but have OCD-like tendencies (with an accompanying mild eating disorder) and am less mentally stable, in control, and healthy than I would like. 

Searching beyond the basics, which I've already found and are limiting substances like caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and recreational drugs, good nutrition, good sleep, exercise, social support and avoiding negative self-talk.

I am looking more for stuff like techniques, such as deep breathing and relaxation techniques, or meditation, mindfulness and so on. Many claims here, but what is proven?
Difficulty is finding the real deal in mental guidelines and support and going beyond the basics (such as sleep) into proven techniques that are scientifically validated.

Can you guys help me in this search?"
991,Recovering Bipolar and Benzo Addict trying to help people suffering like me through building a virtual therapist website and writing a book,"Hi guys, I just joined this subreddit because I am looking for people who share the same struggle. I have been living with bipolar disorder for 5 years now. I am currently taking Lamotrigine and Risperidone. At some point I was taking Valium, a Benzo for my anxiety disorder. I stopped it almost 2 years and I went through horrible withdrawals but I am now seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. After lots of struggle, therapy, reading books, learning about coping mechanisms, I am feeling and I look almost symptoms free. I feel more like a calm introvert now. I am currently writing a book about my struggles with bipolar disorder and my Benzodiazepine addiction, how I was able to overcome those and how I am living a pretty normal life now.  I am going to therapy and I realized how expensive it is without insurance. To bring some value, help people suffering feel slightly better, I am currently building a virtual therapist using AI which people could use to talk about their feelings and externalize their worries. It would be great if you guys could help me add some values to your life and tell me how I could help in any possible way. Thanks"
992,Is this the norm for psych wards ?,"I am going to shadow a psychiatrist soon, however I was reading about this place, and apparently it can be violent. I was honestly shocked about what I read about it, and how badly it’s ran. 

A lot of adolescents go there for behavioral issues, I read about a patient who got jumped by 9 other dudes there and there was only one  female staff to break it up and she barely did anything. Nothing happened to the 9 kids.

There are reviews that say it’s understaffed and at times the staff are hit. They also place suicidal kids, and those with mental health issues in the same room ward as those with violent problems which leads to a lot of fights.. 

Is this normal? I just don’t know if all psych/ mental health places are like this, or is this place is an exception."
993,One Sided Relationship,"I love my sister.  I've moved halfway across the country to be near her.  No shit, I'd give my right arm if she needed it.  And I know people say this a lot, but I actually would consider killing for her if she asked nicely.  But she gives nothing back to the relationship, won't even let me get a word in edgewise if I call her to vent, but whatever I can deal with that.  I'm a disabled vet, and have a procedure coming up for which I need a driver (required but the clinic doing the procedure, I'm 100% positive that I'd be OK to drive after), she's the only person in this part of the country that I know, she has changed dates on me know twice, pushing the date of the procedure out well over a month.  This is a procedure to help with chronic back pain, every day she delays is another day that I get to be in pain.  I've called off on days she was feeling stressed just to go to lunch to make her feel better.  I just feel that the one time I've actually needed her assistance on anything, she is really letting me down."
994,Anxiety from driving is my biggest issue,"I have pretty bad eye sight in my right eye due to corneal damage and driving is the biggest source of stress. It impacts areas of my life even work performance.


When I drive motorbikes or cycle especially cycling . Stress levels  overall are fairly low.

Sitting in a tin can with limited vision in the right although my vision is top notch in the left . The stress seems to linger long after I'm out of the car.

 Does anyone have any advice on how to best reduce heightened anxiety/stress ."
995,OCD with my appearance?,"hello, sorry for bothering anyone but i needed to let this out of my system. 

growing up, i’ve always been complimented for my looks. and maybe that has made me feel like my looks makes me who i am. i’ve never really excelled in anything and the first thing people say when they’re asked about me is “she’s so pretty” and just about my face. 

when i was 14, i had very bad cystic forehead acne and it scarred me. i couldnt face people and tried not to leave the house. i broke up with my boyfriend at that time just because of my insecurities. i had panick attacks when i left the house because i didnt want to feel the stares of others and at home, i cried daily thinking about how horrible my face was. 

now i’m 17, and my face has been healing. of course there are pimples here and there. but recently, one of my pimples near the nose area was infected and it is scarred pretty badly. it is still in the midst of healing but it’s going to leave a scar. and IM AFRAID OF THAT REALLY.. anyways, now this is what’s worrying me, 

during that period of time when it was “healing” , i couldn’t sleep without checking on it 20 over times in the mirror. i couldnt stop obsessing over it and picking at it. i couldn’t stop LOOKING at it and getting out of bed just to see whether i could apply anything, only having to overthink and wash the cream off just to reapply 30 minutes later. i even had a panick attack just thinking about it and cried non stop for 3 hours straight. 

everytime i have something like a pimple, i’d obsess over it and pick at it. i can’t stop myself, i can’t control myself. if i feel a bump on my face, i’d have the urge to get rid of it. i used to be able to control myself but now adays, i can’t. as a result, my face isn’t doing so well. and i can’t sleep because i can’t stop thinking about it. 

is there something wrong with me.. like am i mentally ill? i’ve been struggling with “depression” and anxiety too but im not really sure whether i’m just sad or im actually depressed. god,, i just wanted to let this out."
996,Something is wrong...,"So I’m not sure if this is the right place to be putting this and also please excuse the grammatical errors I don’t feel like making everything proper.
So for the last month or two I’ve been working my ass off and haven’t missed any school or work and have been feeling completely beat to say the least. I’ve finally felt content with what I want to do with my life and I made a good chunk of money this year and I was exited to see what’s next to come. But this past week I’ve been feeling careless and lazy not sure why...
Yesterday I was feeling WEAK like to the point where I was unable to lift my arms, it hurt to walk, breathing was even hard... I was unable to properly type (I was drunk texting basically) and I kept messing up 
Cut to this morning: I woke up with a Migraine and little to no motivation to do anything got ready walked out the house and went to school. It just seemed like a normal morning to me until one of my friends pointed out I was wearing two different shoes Not just a little different ALOT different one was white (adidas) and one was black (Nike) and I froze and just came up with an excuse... I’ve felt cloudy all day, confused, and barely able to put sentences together without sounding under the influence of something. 
I’m not exactly sure what’s going on maybe I’m just over thinking it but I don’t feel like myself 
Just looking for some feedback Thankyou"

999,What sad film do you put on when you need to cry?,"Hey,

I've felt the need to cry for a long time but I don't know how to. Recently I've felt I really need to let out my emotions so I'm turning to sad films. What films do you watch when you want to cry? I don't really like sad films as I'm more of an action &amp; comedy film person so I'd prefer it if it wasn't too depressing but I'll take any suggestions.

Thanks!"
1000,Self Neglect?,"Now don't worry, I've already scheduled an appointment with my therapist over this but I wanted to see if I could get any more information on this.

I'm not elderly - apparently this is just a thing more common with them? I'm 19 and while my parents keep things clean, I have a habit of living in what is essentially a hoarders room. Old food and filth and bugs - it's disgusting and I'm disgusting and I'm finally starting to come to terms with this and I'm desperate. I want to be better - I don't want to live like this for the rest of my life.

Does anyone have any information on this? Or anything that could help - on the rare chance I manage to clean my room it ends up messy again very soon after. It's like I get anxious when it's not a disaster - I have a history of child abuse figured that might help give context"
1001,"When you are having an episode (depressive, bipolar etc) how do you communicate to your significant other? Can you?","My boyfriend is likely major depressed.  He goes through episode where he just withdraws communication for sometimes days at a time, with zero communication. 


Had it up to here.  I’m ready to leave unless he learns how to tell me what’s up.  Otherwise it comes off as him simply not caring about me.  


Thanks"
1002,is it normal to feel this guilty?,"about a week ago i called and decided to start therapy, i was really stoked i finally decided to start getting my life together. 
then she started the screening. 
she asked if i had suicidal thoughts and i said no, not in the past 2 months. 
i lied. 
and then she asked if i’ve done anything to harm myself. 
i said no, not in the past 2 months. 
i lied. 
at the end she asked if there was anything i’d like my therapist to know. i said that even though i’m not in a dark place right now it happens frequently. 
i thought saying that would be good enough. 
now i’m sitting here thinking that it was wrong of me to lie to her; that i should have been truthful and it feels wrong and i don’t know why. 
this feels so stupid, i don’t know what to do."
1003,"I don't want to live anymore, but I am too afraid to kill myself","i just wish i could disappear from this world until all my problems are solved. i don't wanna live anymore, but i'm just too afraid to kill myself 😩 i have tried finding happiness in myself but i don't think i ever will because of my problems. nobody realized the shit you do for them until you stop 😩 i have been suicidal but i'm not confident enough to kill myself. most of the time, i stay in my room feeling sad, depressed, mentally fucked and empty replaying moments from my life and wondering where did it all go wrong..."
1004,I've made up my mind,"I know it may sound wrong and dark, but don't worry, I'm happy and it's the best option for me.

I've made up my mind, I want to kill myself, end this.

The only thing that keeps me here is that I haven't found out yet how to do it painlessly.

Don't be sad, when I'll die. I'll get to know which religion was right. And I will finally be free from all this pain that burns me from the inside.

I feel like I'm going crazy, but strangely, it feels alright. Like I know that is wrong, but have I done something good?

No matter who you are, I just want you to remember that at some point you have to let go. 

You can't do everything. 

It's not true that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It leaves permanent damage that will finally kill you. I think that more accurate would be ""What doesn't kill you, leaves permanent damage""

Love you all"
1005,"People with more mild depression, how did you know you were actually depressed vs. just having some bad days?","I recently (Over the last month or so) started feeling these subtle feelings of sadness. It's not severe but just enough where it's noticeable. I get this feeling about 3-5 times a week. 

I have Bipolar Disorder but I've always had more of the hyomania and not so much the depression. 

Symptoms I have that make me think I might have some depression include: Persistent but mild feelings of sadness, general discontent with certain aspects of my life, some sleep disturbances (every few weeks I'll get about 3 or 4 days in a row where I get really broken sleep). Also pretty bad self esteem/self image issues. 

The self esteem issues I've had for years and the sleep issues I've been having for about 6 or 7 months but the feelings of sadness have been more recent."
1006,Still hanging on,"Thought I would post ... Just in case anyone (besides my bestie) cares or wonders where I've been. Not that anyone does.

I am still hanging on... Barely. Haven't attempted again in the past day or so, but I look like shit: dark circles under my eyes... Eyes sunken in... Just pale as fuck. I don't care since even my family thinks I'm fine.

Fuck. I'm talking to my case manager (Mental Health) and she is telling me to talk to my PO (Probation Officer--yes, for those who don't know, I am a convicted felon on Probation for 2 years after doing a year in Prison) who is a mental health PO. I can't dare tell them I'm planning on killing myself. As the days go by, though, I find myself drifting in and out of wanting desperately to die and not feeling a damn thing. I mean totally NO emotions, good or bad. Forget what that's called. At those moments I don't want to die or live but I can't care about either choice. What a strange feeling that is.

So ... I still have no set plans... But eh. I'm pretty much no emotions at the moment. I even looked at fire vids and shockingly I felt nothing.

I'm hurting but I can't feel... Help?

I could walk into traffic on my way home... Or so nothing. Fuck. I need ... ???"
1007,"I miss my mom so much more when I'm sick, or in physical pain ""Going nuts right now""","It's been hard enough to move on without her, she has been gone for 5 years, she died at a young age(47). I think it also has to do with delayed pain. Though I witnessed my mothers body before the embalmers received her. It still couldn't set in that she's gone. I have been on so many anti depressants, but when I get sick or hurt, I cant take it. I break down, and it feels like she passed yesterday. Just hearing the sound of her voice at times would make me better.

I have been threw a lot in my life, and just don't understand why it has to be one thing after the next, but I can deal with it better if I just had my physical health..

I am so not surprised about my fate, its just the usual for me. After all I have been dealing with the past few months, I just don't know how to handle this anymore.. OF all the stories I have heard about life after loosing a parent,, there is always comments like ""it get's better each year"". But in my case, The B.S problems that come with my life just keep knocking me down. I don't get why it has to be so hard, why cant I just have my physical health. I keep asking what I did to deserve so much pain nothing is helping..

My life has been so traumatic, I have anxiety attacks when im actually at peace because Im worried about the next thing to take it back away, and unsurprisingly, Sunday After injuring myself trying to fix my car that keeps giving me issues, I just said forget it, I am not going to let this get me down.. Monday I woke up, wasn't worried about my car, wasn't worried about my landlord harassing  me over petty things like my car leaking oil. I came to the sense, I actually feel ok.. Then came the anxiety of what is next?! I was so terrified, that i couldn't even leave the house, because it's just so accurate that whenever I feel peace, something is about to take it.

I finally decided to leave against my anxiety to get something to eat.. For a minute I thought things were going to actually be ok. First bite, within 1 second I'm in excruciating pain, about 10 mins later my face swells up.. OK I knew it had to be something. Again I am not surprised at all......... Life is so much harder when you can predict the future. 

Please someone reach out to me with advice on how to deal with my life. These anti depressants I have been on do nothing, switching isn't an option since I have been on them all, and stayed with the only ones that didn't cause overwhelming side effects"
1008,Is it jealousy or something like that ?,"Whenever i do some work at school, i always want to give up and scream as soon i see someone finishing before me. It's like that everytime. When i'm not the first one to finish or doesn't have the best grade, i just want to ripe ou the paper test. It's not just work, it's like that in everything. I draw a lot for example, but when someone say something to correct a thing in my drawing, i just want to make it gone. I never kept one single drawing because everytime i look a them once i finished them, i find them ugly. Like anyone else could do better than me, and it's driving me insane. No matter what it is, when i see someone making friends faster than me, working better, drawing better....I just feel angry and destroyed everytime i realised i wasn't as good as i tought. If i see someone beeing happy for his achievement i get angry too, because i'm never happy for mine."

1011,Medication,"So basically my life is at the point right now where I doubt I’ll make any progress without pharmaceutical intervention. My symptoms are just too high and my problems are too large to handle on my own.

But I REALLY don’t want to do it. How do I bring myself to accomplish this task. It makes me quite anxious and stressed."
1012,Benefits of Quitting Meds?," I've been on 300mg of Wellburtrin and 40mg of Prozac for the past year. Things have been really great lately, and my doc suggested that I start to taper off on my meds.

I'm definitely not against the idea, but is there any real benefit of discontinuing medication? All i can find online is that people quit because they ""don't want to depend on a pill anymore."" Well, I certainly do not care if I depend on a medication that improves my life...

So other than that, what are the benefits of quitting? Why do people work towards getting off of their medication?"
1013,i cant do things,"last year i went away to university expecting it to be the best time of my life. i ended up going for 2 months before returning home as i couldn’t leave my dorm room. i had moved into student accommodation about a week after all my friends had. i was thinking it would be great getting to see them everyday as they lived in the building beside me. i invited them over for dinner the second day of moving in because i needed company and i hadn’t met any of my flatmates yet. they both came round but seemed bored of me but i brushed it off. after that one of them left to go do something else and didnt stay for dinner. me and my other friend ended up going out with the one flatmate i had sorta spoken to (she was super nice i liked her lots). a few days later i asked my friend to come by again and she did except she made us go see the other friend i spoke about. i felt kinda weird when we were at hers because she completely ignored me when i was there.  anyway i had a fun night as we went out together with my flatmate again. a few days go by and my friend doesnt seem to be speaking to me anymore yet i see her hanging around with everyone from school except me. i havent made any friends in my course yet and everyone is older than me and not the nicest. it goes by a week or so and i dont hear anything from her so i ask why shes not been talking to me. “you need to make your own friends” she says “im hanging around with everyone else because their just on the same level of friendship as me” she says. im shocked because shes told me hundreds of times that im one of her best friends and she loves me and trusts me. i felt so heartbroken. i decided i would block everyone i knew because i didnt want to be hurt like this. i felt like i didn’t deserve to have friends. i didnt feel good enough for anyone. i start losing so much confidence in myself and am afraid to speak to people. it got so bad that i couldnt leave my room to go to the kitchen. i couldnt go to class. i couldnt go to the washers to wash my clothes. i wasnt eating coz i couldnt go out and buy food. i wasnt sleeping. i was throwing up most days. having panic attacks because i was so scared someone was going to break into my room. i kept a knife by my bed incase someone came in. i lived beside a motorway so everytime a loud car drove past i thought a plane was crashing. i really didnt want to be there or even be alive. i really wanted to disappear because i felt so alone and worthless. i remember taking a knife to my wrists and just holding it there and crying because i really wanted to die but i was afraid i was letting people down and hurting people by hurting myself. i felt trapped and helpless. it got so bad that i got extremely sick and my mum had to drive and get me while she was on holiday. after that i dropped out of uni and came home to which my mum i felt was disappointed in me.

its been a few months since that all happened and ive applied to go to college this year because i really cant stay at home anymore but im terrified that the same thing will happen again. my anxiety is still pretty bad. i cant do things by myself anymore. i sleep most of the day so i dont have to talk to anyone. im worried my boyfriend thinks im boring because i just dont have the motivation to do things most of the time. i really want to be myself again but i just dont know how. i go to councilling once a week and im not sure its helping. i also recently started betablockers because my doctor gave me them but they arent doing anything and just make me more tired than i already am. 

i really dont know what to do and im so scared that im gonna just repeat last year. if anybody can help me id be much appreciative because i just dont know what to do anymore.

1016,Repetitive negative thoughts,"I get triggered and disturbed by certain things and images I see on the devices I own. I have a normal day and the images that trigger me pops up and ruin the rest of the day or week. And I also feel kind of dirty by doing certain things. I used to feel dirty for watching porn and the ads that pop up in between but I overcame from that but there are still certain things that haunt me for a long time and ruin my mental health. These thoughts and the dirty feeling keeps disturbing me and I always come to the conclusion that is to buy a new device. Laptop or mobile. I feel like all the negative thoughts I experienced gets vanished when I break the device and throw them away. I feel satisfied and will carry on using the new device but that is not the end. It happens again. The images that disturb me pops up again and I would do the things that make feel dirty and end up breaking the devices again. I've changed like 4 mobiles and 2 laptops so far because of this repetitive negative thoughts. I've recently bought a new mobile and felt a good vibe from it. I started to focus on things I've always wanted to and I was in good shape until the same thing occurred again. I've gone through the same thing again yesterday and I feel like I should move on and the things that trigger and disturb me are inevitable and the only way for me is to accept it. Though I feel like I should move on these negative thoughts are ruining my progress and my mental health. Any kind of advice, suggestion and words from you guys will be helpful and I would appreciate it."

I’d like to get to know some fellow sufferers. Hole this isn’t breaking any rules?"

the same thing applies to every subject in college , I'm NOT doubting myself , i know for sure  I'm too stupid , I'm just looking for some advice on how to cope with that , college is hell to me , i hate it , I'm lonely , failure , and i have zero experience in life , i have no memories as a child or teenager and I'm wasting my youth as well .

 I'm the same person as i was at 5 and will be at 40 , just growing up but no life experiences , my relationship with my family is not that good , they treat me very well and i don't hate them , but we aren't a FAMILY it's like we are some strangers living under the same roof we know nothing about each other except for some basic information literally .

very very very silent family which reflected on me growing up with anxiety , every member of the family is not that silent outside the family , on the contrary , they are so funny , loved , and charismatic with other people , but unfortunately  I'm not .

 lately i suffered from stuttering due to not speaking probably more than 5-10 words per day whether I'm in college or home , so depressed for more than 2 years , probably outcast is the right word to describe my daily adventures in college .

I'm planning to suicide at  40 if not before , because at 40 either you lived a very good , successful life so you would get older remembering these days or you're 40 inferior stupid old man with no one around him and with no opportunity to achieve anything in the future , i searched everywhere and tried everything to improve but I'm too stupid to understand anything which is hurting me , i just want an advice to cope with that not to solve it .

( if you have any advice please keep in mind that you're talking to a very stupid naive person so make it clear and simple , BTW,  if you wonder how i managed to study communication engineering being that stupid , I CHEATED, thank you ) ."
1020,Separation anxiety???,"I'm F(17) and still stick to my mom as if it's the first day of kindergarten. I don't have any problems talking to people, trying to make friends, driving myself places, however, I don't like being far from home. There are certain things that cause me to panic like going up to pay, ordering food, large crowds etc. Sometimes I can do it alone other times I end up crying in a corner. With my mom with me or honestly my older sister I'm fine. Because I'm the last kid in the house (siblings all in college) and my mom doesn't get along with my dad, I'm afraid she'll get lonely. It seems like everytime she leaves me on my own bad things happen. 

There was a school field trip today and my mom chaperoned yet got assigned to a different group. The trip was to a very busy college campus and the crowds had me crying. I had to slip away and cry in a less populated area. I ended up leaving with my mom instead of on the bus (went home).

Theres something very wrong and I'm not sure what. The closest thing I could find was separation anxiety, but it seems to be meant for little kids. I would love an outside opinion, perspective, or advice."
1021,Ex got a new boyfriend,"So about a year a ago my ex broke up with me because I was being a depressed anxious mess and she could no longer deal with it. The last straw was her finding me at a restaurant piss drunk out of my mind where she left me to run an errand.

At that time I was seriously struggling with depression and anxiety and my medication was not working as it should have, I was also having a stressful time writing stressful exams to become a CA/CPA. 

After that incident I volunteered to check into a mental health clinic to sort out my stuff and hopefully mend our relationship. A day later she visited me in hospital and broke up with me. We had been dating for 7 years at that point and basically grew up together before that. I was devastated.

Since then I’ve been focusing on my degree and business that I’m running part time. Have not been dating or even trying. I’m really self conscious as I am obese and on the short side(174) furthermore I have no self confidence whatsoever.

I feel really isolated and lonely and my family doesn’t seem to understand what I’m going through. I do see a therapist somewhat regularly, that seems to help, but not always.

Fast forward to 2 nights ago when I decided to visit my ex’s facebook page and guess what she has a new boyfriend. He’s fucking ugly and old and has a kid, hate him, but don’t even know him, just know he’s a cunt! I know it’s to be expected, but it really brought back all the hurt feelings and made me feel like a fuck up for making our relationship end. I feel angry, frustrated and hopeless.

I have no prospects in terms of dating, barely any friends and my family are recluses and keep to themselves. I just want to punch my fists through a fucking wall!!!! I want her back!!! I wish I didn’t fuck it up. 

Tonight I’m drinking myself to sleep, thinking about doing drugs, suicide and whatever else could make me ache with every vessel in my body and psyche.

So what do I do, where do I start? Am I fucked? Should I just give up? I don’t know anymore. Maybe someone out there does???"
1022,Need advice about overcoming eating disorder and body positivity,"I (18F) have been struggling with my relationship with food for a few years now. My weight fluctuates around 7-10kg every year since I either binge every day or starve myself for a long period of time. 
The problem now is that I've been gaining a fair amount of weight since the past 3 months, yet I feel like I'm not struggling as much anymore with my diet, I eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full. There were still times when I binge or feel so ashamed of my body that I just want to starve again, but generally I'm still in control. I'm seeing my friends in a few days and they didn't know that i gained weight, I have been receiving comments from people saying that I noticeably got fatter, and I'm worried about getting judged by my friends. To them I was never this heavy.
I'm afraid this will send me into a spiral of starving myself again to lose weight as quickly as possible (which never work since I always gain them back).
I really want to lose weight in a healthy way, and keeping a steady weight, but I'm overwhelmed by waves of insecurities.
Has anyone ever felt the same and have any advice as to how I can avoid my obsession with rapid weight loss?"
1023,How to enjoy things again?,"My current mental health could be resumed per the following words: meh, bleh, blob, gray.

I feel empty. I don't feel like having any hobbies, like before (playing, reading, learning new things).

The days are just the same, waking up, working, coming home to eat, and going to sleep after passing to much time on the net without doing really anything that feels ""good"".

I just want to go to bed, and stay there. I had medications that didn't really helped (I mean, still feeling like shit, but with less energy than what I currently have).

&amp;#x200B;

I want to enjoy things again, like reading, loving, learning new things, playing. I am not even sure that there is a game I want to play (I feel like having no patience).

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's kinda all. Sorry, this message is a mess. I will probably go to sleep. I will continue to fight tomorrow"
1024,my defense mechanism,"i avoid going out and socializing with people because being with others reminds me of everything i’m not, it’s like my defense mechanism to protect my feelings and avoid feeling insecure."
1025,is it normal to ask yourself if you would care if you died?,"i’ve felt flat for the past 3 or 4 years (on and off) but the periods of ‘numbness’ last for a while but i guess i don’t really notice them cause i feel fine - but that’s all i feel.

i’ll go to concerts and go out with friends and all that but i never really feel happy - i smile and have a good time but i always just feel
flat.

i guess i’ve been suicidal at points in my life but right now, i don’t think i am (?) but i just keep asking myself if it would be all that bad if i died. like would i really mind? would i really miss out on anything? and i don’t think that’s normal but i’m also definitely not suicidal so i just wanna know if anyone else experienced the same sort of thing?"
1026,Mental health and writing papers,"I am doing my second year as a postgraduate.
During my BA I didn't have papers to write.
It's going to be two years and I have never submitted papers on time. I have issues of panic and avoid work, teachers etc. when it's becoming overwhelming. In my mind I'm often confused and I have issues planning and following the steps of writing a research paper. I often go back to the first step and read the same things. With readings I don't manage to read as many as I should, like my brain doesn't want to read, I panic or it feels I don't understand anything. Then time flies I still haven't done much and I panic like hell, cry by myself cause that's the only thing I can do when I go mad about myself. Then idk but it's like being so miserable and telling yourself  that nothing of what you're doing makes sense and in a very bad panic mode I wrap up and send my work barely rereading it cause I'm like I can't read this mess. I wanted to stop so many times cause I feel on the edge....  I'm soon finished with studies but I still feel miserable and picking myself up last minute. Can someone relate? How do you handle this ?"
1027,I hope you're glad with what you've done to me,sick of life
1028,Seasonal-affected disorder,"If you don’t know what it is it basically is a disorder where you get depressed around the same time every year. It is seasonal related. It always starts in the spring for me. It should be winter right now, but it is spring instead. I Can’t sleep, can’t leave my bed. I can’t clean, can’t do the laundry... I’m so tired and I’ve had a really bad day. I don’t have any questions, just had to write. thanks."
1029,"A few steps forward, two steps back",
1030,My Sister’s (16F) Mental Health Is Worse Than Ever And My Family Doesn’t Know What To Do,"My family is having a lot of trouble right now taking care of my little sister. For context, I’m 24 &amp; live alone. My parents live with my 16 year old little sister in the same city. My Grandma also lives in the same city, but she has grown pretty distant because of the situation with my sister.

She’s 16 &amp; has Bipolar disorder as well as high functioning ASD. She sees her psychiatrist once a week, and sees an occupational therapist for group therapy once a week (although she usually refuses to go to this). She’s always been difficult, but her mental health has significantly devolved over the last 6 months to a year. 

She is severely depressed and has extreme anger problems. She has increasingly frequent explosive episodes of rage where she throws anything she can get her hands on and destroys furniture/my family’s belongings and threatens to stab/kill/murder my parents. We believe (and her psychiatrist agrees) that these are dissociative episodes as she does not remember her words or actions after the fact.  

Last December she was having a conflict with her friend group &amp; threatened to commit suicide. This wasn’t the first time and wasn’t the last, but she seemed serious and I was able to convince my family that she needed to be hospitalized, &amp; she spent a week in the hospital. Since coming home, her mental health hasn’t improved much. The conflicts with her friends were not going away, &amp; her friends were pretty toxic. We were able to convince her to delete her Discord account, which is how she would primarily communicate with this friend group. I think this was a good step forward, but she is even more depressed now that she has lost her only friend group. 

Since being hospitalized she has also started going to a therapist weekly, in addition the the Psychiatrist &amp; OT. Starting this month she is now going to the therapist twice a week.

It’s reached the point where she refuses to go to school most days, &amp; leaves early when she does attend. She has an IEP that allows her to arrive at 11am instead of the normal start time, but she still asks to leave early. When she does attend, she basically goes for one class, then lunch, then asks to leave. She is not going to graduate on time, and has failed most of her classes. There’s not an alternative school in her district, and she doesn’t want to change schools. We’re not opposed to her dropping out and pursuing a GED, but she doesn’t want to do that. 

She has worn down my parents to the point she has absolutely no structure or boundaries. She has broken laptops, iPhones, furniture, etc with no consequences. She refuses to go to school, which is causing my parents to miss work. They don’t trust her in the house alone because they’re worried about her safety. They keep all the chemicals &amp; sharps locked up.

In addition to her school attendance, her episodes are getting worse &amp; more frequent. This past Friday she was alone with my Mom, &amp; completely destroyed the house. My Mom locked herself in her bedroom, &amp; then locked the bathroom door. My sister kicked the bedroom door in, &amp; trashed my parents bedroom (she had already trashed the rest of the house) all while threatening to kill my Mom. 

We are all hesitant to call the Police on her because of how frequently mentally ill people are killed by the Police. However, in this instance my Mom wanted to call 911. My dad was on his way home &amp; convinced my Mom not to call the cops, which he has since admitted was a mistake. We’ve all agreed if another episode happens where my family feels unsafe, that they should call 911.

She takes a few different medications, which have been helping with her depression, but not the rage episodes. My parents are looking into services that bring mental health professionals into the home to help, but I thinks that’s too little, too late. I worry about their safety. To be clear, my sister has never followed through on any of these threats, but I worry that the worse her episodes get the more likely she is to follow through. My grandma and I think she needs to be in a residential care facility until her anger issues &amp; mental health improves. Unfortunately, there aren’t any places like that in our state (Nebraska). Another complication to providing her care is that she is trans. Luckily everyone in my family is accepting, but it does make it harder to find mental health professionals that are not transphobic."

1032,I want to try and figure out my problem.,"Hello there. I am a 25 year old male and I've had a history of maladaptive behaviors and a lifestyle I would consider not optimal. I've tried to discover what my problem has been to little avail. 

When I was very young people would often say that I had seemed depressed at times, though I dont remember it too vividly. What I do remember is that in was a weird kid, ostracized for my oddness and extremely interested, almost addicted to learning pointless things. Every week would be a different topic to me ants to hurricanes to planets. I'd absorb all knowledge I could obsessively then entirely lose interest shortly thereafter, moving onto something new. I got to the point where I read several books before school in the library every day. I dont read like that now and dont remember why I loved it so much. 

Because my social interactions were so embarrassing and I'd always end up having my words twisted by others in attempts to mock me so that they could seem funny, I eventually started to avoid all people. I know now it was my own weakness/shortcomings, my inability to be clever in conversation and stage fright. Starting around high school I developed a cold distant personality but still sought others approval. Was still a huge nerd but got a more cool/physically violent reputation after several won fights. I got my first girlfriend around this time and was more happy than ever. The feeling I had was nearly impossible to imagine now and seems like a story or dream. 

At high school went on I immersed myself in video games to a degree which I can only describe as addictive. This combined with my coldness led to me becoming a horrible person which led to my then girlfriend leaving me, which I cannot blame her for. But it shattered me. I entirely disregarded my first two years of college and ended up failing out. The entire time i had several extremely close friends. Never the same people but always the same sort of relationship where we felt we were inseparable. Every friend I've had like that no longer will contact me or respond to my messages. No explanation either.

Became severe alcoholic and moved far from home state for next 3 years. Always hoping the alcohol would kill me unexpectedly. I thought I was suicidal but the truth is I didnt want to die, I just couldn't stand living how I was. Moved back to homestate after ruining every relationship there somehow began blue collar job. Going to school now but slipping again as I just dont care. Now I have no friends, my family hates and feels betrayed by me. I don't blame any of them. I talk to noone. I've developed good social skills and can be the center of a room but relationships evade me entirely. 

Mostly I feel nothing, but with moments of extreme explosive emotions (mostly deep endless anger) where I feel murderous and like the anger has no limit. To cut things short I'm now taking meth and isolating and feel I'm fading away. I've tried therapy briefly several times in my life and also got on prozac. Like meth its usefulness faded. The only thing I seem to feel any joy from is violence, which is obviously unacceptable. I've tried to solve this but idk what to solve. I feel like I'm heading to the end and I just can't bring myself to care about it."
1033,I'm so scared,"My mom was just diagnosed with kidney cancer a few days ago. I'm really scared and breaking down mentally. I love her so much. I'm worried about how I'm gonna take care of my younger siblings. I have an older brother, but I know I'll have do a lot more babysitting. 



I just want her to be okay 😭"
1034,Does it sound like bpd to anyone ??,"I'm scared of commitment, every time I get slightly close to anyone I find a way to ruin everything. I reject people so I don't get rejected. I hurt people first so they don't get to hurt me later but by doing it I hurt myself even more.

I guess it comes from insecurity but I feel like everyone hates me and unconditionally will abandon me. If people give me compliments or just act nicely I feel like they do it because they feel pity for me.

I fucking hate people and love them at the same time. I can't accept affection but I'm so much craving for it. I'm scared that the smallest mistake will ruin everything so I don't even try, I give up before even trying so I don't have to deal with even the slightest possiblity of failing. I'm destroying myself and it's all my fault.

I also have SEVERAL other ""symptoms"" such as impulsive dangerous acts(self harm, taking large quantities of medication, shoplifting, binge eating etc) I have very unstable relationships, my whole life I've been told I'm too ""sensitive"" and that my reactions are exaggerated.

I also have something idk if it's a thing but ""depressive episodes"", I feel quite anxious and depressed everyday but sometimes everything is extremely intense and my suicidal thoughts are screaming like never before and I do even more stupid shit than I usually would, every time ""the depressive episodes"" feels like the end of the world and like it will never end."
1035,"I look at my scars sometimes long after they've healed, and feel so guilty, like I've hurt a part of my family, because I'm part of them","Like my grandad always asked me if i was happy, and always did things to make us happy, and was just a part of me, and i feel like my body is part of him and my whole family and i feel guilty that I've done that to myself/them"
1036,300mg XR Wellbutrin experiences,"Hello! I recently got my dose of XR Wellbutrin changed from 150 to 300 and I just took it an hour ago and I feel terrible. I was wondering if anyone can let me know if they had experienced anything like this and if the side effects like more depression, more sedation, and brain fog from upping the dose. I’m thinking about making an appointment in 2 days to get the 150 XRs perscribed again because I felt a very positive effect from those like less social anxiety (although I did have to face side effects for 4 weeks). Please let me know how long it took for the effects of the dose upping to go away.

I’m just so upset that I finally felt like my life was in control for 2 weeks now I feel like shit again"
1037,recently has been weird and I don’t like it,"today I was anxious all day and later in the day I kept crying over small things and getting uncontrollably upset. I’m literally never like this. I’m usually happy all day. I don’t know what caused this. I am just so tired. I don’t have the energy to go to my three dance classes today, but my mom will make me go I guess. It’s been winter for two months, but right now it’s getting so hard.  mentally I am in the right place, I’m otherwise happy, but this random sadness keeps prevailing. I don’t know if it’s a seasonal thing or I’m just lonely but please can I have some support."
1038,Fun little summary of my poor mental health,"Somewhat frequently, life doesn’t feel real to me. I know it’s real, but it feels like a dream. I feel a disconnect.

Other times, I have inner conflict and turmoil in trying to figure out who I am. I feel like I have no real identity outside of being the funny guy. 

Around people, I people please and go out of my way to try to help people out. I’ll give people money, possessions, and help them do things. At the end of the day though, I’m all alone. I’ll reach out and people will ignore me. Even my closest “friends” will constantly take shots at me in the form of insults and I’ll just take it in stride and laugh. I’ll even sympathy laugh if something isn’t funny.

I feel like people will use me for what I’m worth, but they don’t respect me because I am so much of a people pleaser. I want to improve and be my genuine true self around others...but I don’t even know who my true self is. I feel multiple sides of myself fighting for control. Whether it’s the “chill and laid back” guy or the super aggressive “no excuses for failure” guy.

Women blow me off and I’ve only had a handful of relationships. For a while I rode the Red Pill train and it somewhat worked. I don’t agree with the overall philosophy, but certain aspects such as being assertive and calling people on their shit has provided me with more opportunities. I hopped off that train because the Red Pillers overall are toxic and rely on manipulation.

My parents are Narcissists and completely destroyed any sense of self worth I had growing up and I spent my entire childhood striving to make them proud. Nothing ever worked and they still make light of all of my accomplishments.

I consistently have dark dreams and sleep paralysis. My dreams consist of me being tortured, murdered, screamed at, and ostracized. Sleep paralysis often has me struggling to breathe for several minutes as I try to force my body awake. Hell, the sleep paralysis demon/shadow people don’t phase me anymore.

I just feel so lost. This is my effort to not just laugh off these issues as I have been doing. If you read this far, thanks fam. 


TLDR: I might be a little fucked in the head"
1039,Does anyone want to share their story on my blog?,Hi guys. I have a mental health blog and I honestly just wanted to share peoples stories. Would anyone be interested in posting theirs? It can be totally anonymous. You can write it or you can tell it to me and I’ll write it for you.
1040,What the hell is going on with me,"I’ll keep myself as short as I can. 

I’ve been going through a very rough time in my life recently, with stressfull situations happening from every direction. 

The only thing is I’m not feeling stressed about it.

A thing that has always been recurring with me is that when I’m stressed I can feel that gut wrenching anxiety kick in. 

But now I don’t feel it anymore.

Instead I feel numbed out, as if my body is subconsciously suppressing anxiety and emotions for me because it’s too much to handle. I feel like I’m observing everything around me from a window. I’m so indifferent nowadays and it’s scaring me. 

Yet I’m experiencing mood swings and major sensitivity to criticism. Sometimea I burst into sobbing.!So I’m clearly not as fine about everything that I initially thought. 

In a way it’s nice to not feel the anxiety, but I don’t know how good this really is for me. 

Any advice?"
1041,Is it possible to become an organ donor while I'm still alive?,"I mean nothing. I'm a jerk. An addict. A schizophrenic. I have anger issues. People don't usually like me because they either see this shy idiot stumbling over her words, a needy trainwreck always seeking love and approval, a paranoid piece of trash that's annoying to be around, or a lazy, unmotivated bag of excuses that rarely gets out of bed unless it's for work in the morning. 
  
  
At least if I surrender my organs, I can benefit someone else. I can help several people, actually. I'm barely using any of this stuff the way that I should, but according to my doctor, I'm still reasonably healthy. 
  
  
How can I give up my less-used organs while I'm still alive? Do I have to die first, or can I just go sell them somehow? My family could benefit from the money, at least, both for the organs and/or for the life insurance policy. I think that's how this works."
1042,I’m so confused...,"Things were/are going well. I was happy for a little. For some reason though, I can go from being happy, to wanting to not exist quickly. Not like a second thing, but today was going really well. My classes weren’t too bad and I actually enjoyed them for the most part. The only downside to the day was that I started feeling a bit unwell, but that’s not what caused my mood to change. I don’t know what did. I’m trying right now to snap myself out of it and it is working a little. Then my thoughts go wild again over simple conversations I’ve had today, and I start feeling stupid and pathetic again. It’s hard for me to just stop thinking about it too.

The other thing is, I have a weird issue with not eating during the day at school. I never usually eat breakfast, (I did today but it was small, and it was one of the rare days), and then I go without eating lunch. By lunch, I don’t feel great. I’m hungry and maybe a little light-headed. I don’t worry too much about passing out, because there have been days where I don’t eat until like 7pm and I’ve made it, but it’s weird. I don’t eat even though I’m hungry. I just don’t feel like eating, and then just end up feeling physically worse during the day. Part of it might be because I worry people will judge me when I’m eating, but I don’t think that’s the sole reason.

I’m tempted again to go down the path of not doing my school work, which happened last quarter and I failed a class (just for the quarter, I don’t have to retake the class). I’m forcing myself to do the work because I know I can’t fail. I need to graduate this year, and I’ve been accepted to college, so I can’t afford to screw it up. 

I’m just...conflicted...if that makes sense. I have times where I think I’m happy, then I go back to not wanting to exist (I have no intent of harming myself, I just sometimes wish I could disappear). It sucks, but I’m just confused as to what the hell is going on with me."
1043,Do I suffer from mental illness? Scared..,"I have had this feeling of forgetting something for the past 2.5 months and it is driving me insane.  More specifically I have this notion in my head that some unknown expense is going to hit my bank account and complicate things for myself. 

I have made excel spreadsheets, combed through months of my financial records, and nothing jumps out as a surprise. I've compiled a list of every bill and recurring expense I have and again, nothing shows that I have ANYTHING to worry about. I've read over these lists and excel files thousands of time thinking I will get peace in numbers. Every hour minutes of my time are wasted thinking about this and my brain just seems to go in circles. NOTHING will give my brain peace of mind to shut these intrusive thoughts out. EVERYTHING on paper shows i have nothing to worry about by my brain is choosing to believe otherwise. I thought this could just be anxiety, but i can deal with my anxiety in the past. I dont know what this is........"
1044,I am afraid to get hel,"I've been struggling to make friends, wake up to school, get a job and pretty much interact with other people. I'm 21 and it's been three years since I had a partner (the only one I've had in my life) and I feel too ugly and insecure to date... I also tend to shut down when people ask me out. When I'm in class I try to participate but my heart accelerates with the sole idea of raising my hand. I still have friends though, just a few and they know I've never had sex so I feel quite uncomfortable when they talk about their experiences and how much I'm missing. I want to get better and I know I need to, but I'm already too tired to keep on trying. I have had panick attacks, I feel people judging me and I feel miserable almost all day. I found out they offer counseling at my school but I'm too afraid to talk about it with anyone... I really don't know what to do"

1046,Hia I'm new to this,Hey so I'm new here but I really need someone to talk to and I don't know what to do.
1047,How to deal with long term stress?,"So for about 2-3 years I've had anxiety feelings and at this point it feels kind of normal to be stressed all the time and just want to fix it. Just have enough money from art work to get by month by month. I feel like the stress is hindering my ability to do more work. Seems like a circle that just keeps repeating. I don't have much time to hangout, I've been trying to get my sleep schedule back on track on and off for about a year. Not sure what to do, about to say fuck it and hit the road and just be a bum or something"
1048,I'm afraid to get better.,"I'm afraid to treat my mental illnesses because I feel like it's who I am and if I get rid of it, there will be nothing left. I've been sick for so long, I dont know who I am with out it. It's weird because I hate myself and I dont see any value to who I am as a person, but I'm afraid of losing all that I know about myself. Also, sometimes I think anxiety is the only thing keeping me alive. Anxiety is like my life jacket in the sea of depression. Without it, depression will consume me."
1049,Panic attacks,"Am I stuck with panic attacks all my life? Or is there something I can do to stop having them after a while.

I'm pretty ok at controlling my panic attacks now but I still don't want to deal with them all my life. I also can't take medicine to stop them (last time I tried I became extremely depress).

So is there anyway I can eventually stop having panic attacks, with out medication?"
1050,10 years of mental illness,Just wanted to share. Does it get better? Yes. And then gets worse again and keeps going. I don't know what I am like without it. I don't remember the last time I really had an interest in anything or had a hobby. Well I'm still alive so I guess that counts for something.
1051,I need help and advice (Desperate),"So I obviously suffer from Mental Health issues or I wouldn't be in this subreddit. But I really need help because I don't know what to do anymore. I'm extremely lost, confused, anxious, depressed and everything in between. All I want to do is find distractions that can help me. I've honestly tried everything and it's harder to find something that will keep my attention completely. Video Games don't help like they used to, Movies can't keep my attention like they used to, Reading Comics don't last anymore because they don't last long, and I can't read Books without losing my attention immediately. I have so much I'm trying now. I even do some humiliating shit on Twitter as I roleplay because it's distracting me. But not in the good way and only lasts for a bit. Music doesn't calm me down as much and I'm lost still. What I've started to do is drink a lot of beers to get me tipsy or drunk. It helps block out my Psychosis that I have and my laughter that was caused by trauma when I was younger. I go through so much pain and sadness it's hard to do anything. I just wanna find something to make me happy and distract me from the voices and hallucinations I constantly see and hear. I tried getting into the X-Men Evolution TV show since I thought I could get into the X-Men, but I couldn't and was looking at my phone and waiting until the episode would end. I feel so lost typing this and upset. I just wanna be happy again. My psychiatrist appointments keep getting delayed, my doctor pushes my appointments back and makes me wait longer, my counselor takes forever to see me again. Nothing is good right now and I can't figure out a way to do anything. Please help me."
1052,Just lost my therapist....,"Probably will delete this later. I've never posted here before. Apologies in advance.

She called me today to say that she won't be working with me anymore because she's being moved somewhere else (staff shortages). 

I am absolutely devastated. Been crying non-stop all day. Self harmed very badly. Just feel at a complete lost.

It took me years to finally find someone I could connect with and open up to. (I had a very traumatising experience with my first therapist when I was 13). She was amazing and really helped a lot. I was doing DBT with her and she was helping me move out of my current living situation because it's so toxic.

My favourite thing about her was that she was no bullshit; she never humoured me, she always listened and gave me a lot of really good coping mechanisms. Plus there was always some banter in our sessions which really helped bring up my mood.

My current situation is.... extremely difficult and complicated. I don't know whether to say any of it. Needless to say that what I have discovered through therapy and talking to other doctors is that I suffered through extreme psychological and emotional abuse (as well as borderline sexual and physical abuse?) and to top it off I had to take care of my mother since I was 11 (24 now)

I have no life. No real life friends. I'm not allowed go outside. Not allowed have any joy at home. I'm struggling with everything at life. And the only relief I got was going to my therapy sessions once a week -- I was able to gasp for air and be allowed to process with whatever new bullshit came up.

But right now I feel like I'm drowning and that everything I've been working so hard towards is just slipping away. I feel like I've gone back to square one.

Don't blame her for one second - I completely understand that it's just the state of the health services; there's under-staffing everywhere. And it's not like I'm left out to fend for myself - I've been assigned to another girl working where I go to. She's an absolute sweetheart.... but I can't really talk to her? I feel like she doesn't really listen and it's all the same responses I get. 

I get on well with her. But I don't think she's the right fit for me? Because there's a lot of shit to go through, and it's just very surface level with her. 

I just.... I don't know. The one solid support I had is gone and I feel totally lost. *I was doing so well.* And now? I feel so trapped.

I'm really sorry about this. I don't want to come across as whiny or needy. I'm just a stupid cunt who needs to get over it - life happens. Other people deserve more help.

Feel so lost.

I'm so sorry."
1053,Does it Sound Like There's Actually Something Wrong With Me?,"  So, I want to start this off by stating that I do not wish to find direct diagnoses online, as I am not completely daft. I am also not going to exaggerate for the sake of theatrics or entertainment so don't expect this to be a wholly entertaining post to read.  

  I have never been to a psychiatrist in my entire life, nor taken any sort of medication (regular medication I mean, I have taken Advil and such). My father detests going to such resorts and believes it would be better to personally overcome these obstacles rather than take medicine to ""escape"" them and to a degree I agree with him to this day. However, I also believe that this life is short and that if you can take such measures to ensure happiness for the 80 years you'll probably be alive, then go for it (such are my mother's beliefs). I have always chosen not to get any sort of help for my ""issues"" that I may or may not have because as far as I know they are normal! So, let me tell you what I have going on here in my life, as well as why I chose to come here on an anonymous account.  

  Whenever I was younger, I was not the brightest bulb in the closet per say. In fact, I would go as far as to say I was one of the dullest, barely staying lit as others seemed to light up entire stadiums around me in my school and high school later on. I was almost put in special ed in fact, but my parents saved me from whatever that was going to be and I continued through the day to day hub grub of whatever school has turned into nowadays. Pretty normal right? I would say so, except for the very young, dark thoughts that plagued my mind. Very often I thought of.. well, killing people. In the shower, in my bed keeping me awake at night, it was very odd. Very sudden to, it felt as if one night I was toiling away at whatever useless task I was given by my parents to try to redeem the fact that I was lack-luster in education, the next I was thinking about this all of the sudden. Now, ""what do you mean by 'thoughts of killing people'?"", I mean very much that, I thought of how it would feel, what facial expressions they would make. Sometimes I even thought of how ""good"" it would feel, whenever I would get very angry at something or someone.  

  Now, let me get something across to you. No, I have not and will not kill people and yes I know that it is wrong, obviously. I understand that people all have separate personalities and that we're all special ""in our own ways"" and all that. That doesn't stop the thoughts though, they haven't stopped to this day and I still don't know what they mean for me. However, I have come to realize that they, as well as many other things, may be reaching a boiling point in my life that I can't un-boil. Well, as well as one instance before, when things got a little out of hand and I was throwing a frog at a garage door over and over to see what would happen. I didn't feel anything back then,as I fear that I had not learned compassion at that point in my life (at the to-old-to-not-know-compassion-or-empathy age of 13). I still feel horrible for it now, like something got really close to breaking at that point.  

  As I said before, these thoughts pursue me to this day, but they're not the only things that followed me to this point. I have also struggled with some pretty severe depression that I have told my family about, somewhat. Whenever I first almost got to the point of suicide, I called my mom before and she convinced me out of it, afterwards telling everyone to keep an eye on me. I was mad at first, but it was a pretty logical decision at the time (I mean, what would you do?). Past that, my family knows nothing else came out of it. Past that, they still don't know about the many, many other times I have critically thought of ending my own life for reasons I still can't quite type down on here. The latest failure only being caused by the knife I tried to use being to dull, funny in a way, really annoying in another. Well, I shouldn't say that, I don't really \*want\* to die after all, at least not right now. I'm sure in a day or two I'll relapse and try again, that's been the cycle for the past two years after all. Sort of a living hell, but there isn't much I can do right now given my financial situation.  

  Past the depression, you can guess I've always had a pretty bad bipolar issue. As I previously stated, it only takes a day or two for me to completely change personalities and hate everything, want to die, want to give up. Than, a day or two later, I'm right as rain and back to normal like nothing ever happened. This, again, has always been a problem in my teenage/young adult life. I'm not sure if it has been in my younger life, but if it has, my parents have never talked about it with me at all.  

  And even further down the hole of.. whatever this post is, I also have my social problems. I could not talk to people when I was younger, anyone that wasn't my close family was off limits to me. Pretty normal again right? Except for the fact that this continued through elementary school, high school, and my current life. I've taught myself to talk to people and I'd like to think I do it rather well now, but there's a problem as per the usual! Emotions, I detest them. Any time that I laugh, cry, or anything at all, I feel as if I'm not doing it naturally. Like something is telling me that I should react this way instead of me just doing it like a \*normal person that I should be\*. Like, I'm a robot that you just slide a card into and a pre-determined emotion spits out of its speaker, then you move on. This is the root of my other problem with holding friends, as in I can't keep up with them. It just feels pointless to talk with people because eventually something's going to happen that will make them sad, happy, mad, disgusted or something else with anything whether you're there or not! So, why do I have to be a part of this process when eventually it's just going to end off anyways! Is this normal to think? Do people just deal with these thoughts in order to have a social life?  

  Moving back to point, I want to add one more thing to this before I stop. I have no trauma, no rape, no particularly bad memories, no PTSD, not even a real bully! (By that, I mean that kids teased me for being quiet and such, but nothing really horrible like dunking my head in a toilet!) I had a happy childhood! My father used tough love to teach us (me, my brother, and my sister), but he still loved us just the same, same as my mother. Nothing ""triggers"" any of it, it's just there, for no reason other than the fact that my brain was created therefore it must exist inside of it.  

  So, I want to ask the people of this sub anonymously, is this normal? Or do you think that I should seek help for any of this?  

TL;DR: I have thoughts of homicide and suicide, I am bipolar as hell, I have trouble keeping friends, have no social life, and I've never been to a psychologist or had regular medication. Am I a not normal?"
1054,Is NAMI a joke I'm not in on?,"I've been leaving voicemails at my local (Albuquerque, NM) NAMI office, asking if they can help me find a paychiatrist, with no response. I am disabled and mentally ill and need a psychiatrist. That's all. 

Is NAMI a joke? Should I stop leaving them voicemails? I don't understand. What do they do, if they don't actually help people?"
1055,Stressed,"So for about 2-3 years I've had anxiety feelings and at this point it feels kind of normal to be stressed all the time and just want to fix it. Just have enough money from art work to get by month by month. I feel like the stress is hindering my ability to do more work. Seems like a circle that just keeps repeating. I don't have much time to hangout, I've been trying to get my sleep schedule back on track on and off for about a year. Not sure what to do, about to say fuck it and hit the road and just be a bum or something"

1057,Seeking mental health advice.,"I live in the US and was wondering if anyone knew how much it would cost to see a psychiatrist. 
At my job you aren't able to get medical benefits until after a year of employment and that's if you qualify or catch the enrollment on time. I've been suffering from anxiety and depression for quite a while now and really need to try seeing someone or getting medication to help me out. I at first didn't want to because I didn't want to be someone that has to rely on medication just to feel normal. I'm just so tired of feeling so anxious all the time. 
I would really appreciate any advice I can get.
Thank you."
1058,I hate the constant yelling,Literally no matter what I do she just won't stop yelling at me.
1059,I feel so guilty. Please help if you can,Please help if you can. I feel guilty but I can’t think of a reason to feel guilt. I have a build up of things which I feel bad about. It’s affecting my sleep and my day to day life. Please help if you can
1060,How to focus,"Please someone help. I can´t focus on studying and it takes so long. I haven´t slept for 42 hours and I can´t focus. So it seems the number will just grow. I´m either crying or hurting myself.

I´m sorry for my bad English and this mess, but I feel like I´m losing my grip on sanity. I would rather just die than continue living like this.

If you read this I´m sorry for wasting your time and have a nice day."
1061,I just like to imagine this.,"I don't know if it's normal, or if it's just some weird habit.

You know how teenager/child think about their futur ? I'm 15. So, it's not a problem of finding what i want to do when i will grow up, even tho i have no idea. It's juste that when i imagine myself in the futur, i always imagine myself commit suicide in various way. And it makes me happy and smile to think about it. Sometimes i cry thinking about it while smiling, but i don't know if they are tears of happyness or not.

I like to imagine how everyone will care or not. If my death will be calm or not. Sometimes i imagine it painful and bloody, sometimes just calm and relaxing.But i think i have a preference for the bloody/hurt thing ya know ? I think it's because i miss being hurt physicaly/emotionnly by the other. The majority of the time i hurt myself like a big girl by imagining things. 

I also adore to imagine my friends starting to bully me for some reason ? Or getting mad at me. Or sprending rumor about me. Or hurting me by any way possible. I think it started in a middle of a period where i was cutting myself for attention, and when my best friend/an another girl noticed it, they didn't do anything. That day i felt so much guilt for showing them that. I should have think before just showing them that ugly arm of mine who was red because of the cutting.

When i imagine my adulthood, i don't image death but more a painful life. With just me constantly making myself bleed because i know that if i were to live alone at home i could do what i want. So i just imagine me cutting more and more my skin. 

In fact i always want to be in constant physical pain. I think i feel less pain than average due to multiple experience. So it's a good thing right ? But i love feeling pain because it's so rare when i feel it...espacially bleeding. I love bleeding but don't notice when it happened. It's always someone else who make me noticed it.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't take me wrong, it's been a long time since i stop cutting myself, but i think i miss it way too muche, it's been 2 years i can't stop myself of thinking of it almost everyday."
1062,Multiple personality disorder? Or something else.,"So, I'm making this post just to get some input into what I experience. I have constantly conflicting emotions about a lot of things, feel like I jump between both sides and never feel like I can find firm ground in one or the other.

Occaisionally this happens day to day, for example one day I'll feel a certain way towards something, then the next day I feel the opposite towards it.

 For example:
Some days I wake up and I just have this urge to talk to as many people as possible and just connect with the humanness of people, I don't often actually do this because of anxiety and trust issues. Then the next day I might wake up and just completely hate humanity, what we're doing to the planet, each other and ourselves and just not want to talk to anyone. 

Another example, one day I will wake up and feel like I've got my life together and everything is working towards my vision, the next day I might wake up and nothing significant has happened, however it feels like I'm just spiralling with no direction.

Another example, I look at my friend's and feel like their trying to manipulate me, then a couple hours later I start to feel like I'm being manipulative, even if there is no reason for this. I know I'm not attempting to be manipulative, however I often feel like maybe I'm not entirely aware of my own motives. 

Also I never have a firm grasp on who I am, it constantly changes day to day, even sometimes mid way through a day. When I look in the mirror I never feel like I can ""see"" who I am, it's always a ""different face"" (not literally, however I do feely face changes often, in subtle ways but it is exagerated to myself)

This isn't the only thing that I experience, however I feel I need to start somewhere, currently feel like I am a walking sack of mental health issues, each one just unravelling after one another.

I've also been diagnosed with PTSD relating to various subjective and objective traumas, however I feel it is more than this. But I could be wrong.

I'm going to see my GP this week to try and get a further assessment."
1063,Is there a term for someone who absolutely HATES being interrupted when they’re in the middle of something but doesn’t have any specific compulsions?,"So I’ve noticed this thing about me where if I’m in the middle of something and I’m so close (and I mean SO FUCKING CLOSE) to the end and get interrupted somehow I get really pissed and irritated. Like as a kid when I would watch a movie and my parents came in to talk to me when there was literally 10 minutes left I would yell at them. Or if I read a book and I’m 2 pages from the end but then someone decided to talk to me. It didn’t happen a lot but it happens occasionally and I’m wondering if there is a specific term for it. I wouldn’t classify myself as OCD because I don’t have any specific compulsions, these are just average things I do in my life like reading, watching movies, focusing on any task. It might be a weird form of wanting closure or focus or something idk, this is also why texting while driving is a problem for me cause if I start a text while at a red light and don’t finish it by the time the green comes I feel really frustrated."
1064,Today's Mental Health Help. Who Wants It?,"This is no trick or scam. I'm not asking for money. All I'm getting out of this is experience and helping others. I'm an advocate for Mental Health and pursuing a career in Councelling and volunteering to do this. 

Who wants to discuss openly their mental health troubles with an unbiased person with a different perspective, that are stopping you from your goals and are open to try new things?

Experts say this only works if you are open to change (which can include things you may or may not be doing). You can't adjust the whole world but you can adjust yourself right?"
1065,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, do you?","I’m a 16M who’s not feeling the same anymore... my brother says I used to be so cocky and arrogant and he used to love arguing with me, but ever since I got a girlfriend he said I’ve been becoming so soft, I even notice how I don’t have any energy for anything and all I do is think about her...

I also have a major problem where I can’t stop telling lies for fun, that’s all I do, tell lies for fun and I can’t stop... I almost lost my girlfriend after I was caught in one of them lying about her... I’ve always lied but ever since I started dating her I’ve got worse and started lying even more... I love her and I really don’t wanna end things but I’m afraid she will... 

I don’t eat anymore despite being a hungry boy my whole life and all I do is think about her and how much stuff I regret... I get sick twisted fun out of making fun of people and roasting people in big groups of friends and I can’t stop no matter how much I’m asked... I started seeing ants on the wall but when I go closer or touch them they disappear, and smelling/ tasting stuff that I haven’t seen in ages. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I hope some of you do"
1066,Starting the conversation in the skateboarding world featuring professional Chris Haslam,"Thankfully people like Chris are starting the conversation. Skateboarding is full of lost people and up until recently there has been no one talking about mental health issues.

1067,I am indifferent,"I am not happy, nor am I sad. I'm indifferent with pretty much everything I do and accomplish these days and it irritates me since I have no idea why I feel like this.
I have a wonderful, loving girlfriend who's awaiting our first child, a supporting family and friends, a high-status job with almost limitless opportunities, which makes me pretty much economically independent for the rest of my life but still, I'm indifferent with these things.  
Me and my girlfriend travel, eating out, go on small adventures and such, but when the initial excitement cools down, I just feel like I'm tired of the things, and just want to do something else, but I have no idea what or why.  
I don't even care anything about soon being a dad or that my girlfriend is having a baby in her belly. I don't feel anything at all about it.
A couple of weeks ago, I found out that one of my friends was in fact, not the person who he said he was. He has been lying to me for the last almost two years, but still I don't feel like I'm angry, surprised, disappointed or anything. I just feel empty of feelings, as if I don't have energy to care about it.  
Sometimes I feel like I only do the things that people around me expect me to do, like a robot, and not the things I want to do. The problem is that I have no idea what I really want to do."
1068,I don't know how to feel,"Hello.

I don't really know why i'm writing this, I guess I just need to talk and maybe someone to explain why I am feeling what I'm feeling. In my day life I pretend to be okay, it's not just pretending though, I actually believe it. Sometime I fall on this song on YouTube and its like the gate of a dam has been opened. For some reason all my emotions spill out, my head feels like its about to explode, and I just cry and cry. There's almost nothing I don't understand normaly, but this is something I don't. I just don't know why this happens. When I listen to the song i'm powerless and all that comes into my mind is how alone I am, how much I hate myself, and so on. I know logically that I'm not though, there are people around me. I just don't know. I don't want this to happen. I feel like my entire existence is made of pain, it hurts so bad, I don't want to exist. 

Before anyone gets ideas, i'm not suicidal, because I don't like losing."
1069,I believe I may have Borderline Personality Disorder,"After hearing about BPD online I noticed that it's symptoms closely aligned with my thoughts and actions. I have taken a few 5-minute quizzes online but I know of course that being told by one of those you have BPD hardly means anything. I would like to elaborate on why exactly it is I believe that I have BPD so that some of you can share your opinion.

I tend to become hopelessly attached to one person and I get very stressed out if they even hint that they may not be interested in speaking to me. I think it's important to note that I have NEVER developed any physical or romantic attraction to anyone, my relationships with them have been purely platonic and I've never wished that it were otherwise. But when I meet someone I think is cool, I'll idolize them and I'll convince themselves that they're perfect.

I have a terribly short temper. I also find myself feeling empty and just lying in bed for hours on end. I've never wanted to kill myself but I've felt for a long time that I don't want to be alive. If that makes any sense.

I really doubt that I have BPD, but if one of you good people think I may need to seek the opinion of a professional, then I of course will."
1070,Well hi,"Hi, im 14 y.o girl, i was bullied in primary (for the us its like elementary to middle school), it was really difficult and i kind of disconnected. Fast forward many years and in secondary( high school for US folk) and i never had a stable good friendship, i have a boyfriend but its not the same. Lately i started getting a supportive voice in my head. Either repeating my name, asking if im okay, or 2 days ago it told me to calm down in my mother tongue. I used to be scared, but now i feel less lonely. I just don't want it to split off from me. I often lose touch with reality and faze out, i have also a side of me which some times persists for weeks of severe depression, self harm and suicidal thoughts, after i get better,  i dont connect with them memories or emotions i felt, its like i was someone else. Also, sometimes when i write my emotions or start to think slightly delusional-y, i fear someone will do something, if i write it down, i ended up ripped several diary entries out. My therapist says my mental state is bad, so guess thats a thing. I feel bad for my parents sometimes. Right now, im quite positive, might leave school and learn at home. Also, if i concentrate i can kind of spark the voice to come back.

I dont know, ask questions or state your thoughts/opinions.

Love, pierogi ❤"
1071,A day at a time a step at a time (vent),"This past year has been crazy, I(28m) have been coping/battling with depression/anxiety for close to 5 years now. My mental health renders me tired, irritable and sometimes depending on vices and extreme methods of escapism. I was physically and mentally abused as a child. And I've slowly come to peace with that period of my life being a big cause of alot of what I would call my problems.  I had tried unhealthy methods of medicating myself (cannabis, alcohol, cocaine) which to no surprise caused a huge increase in my horrible moods. I also tried help through the NHS but they also just wanted to medicate me ( I was given zoloft, which was great for switching the feelings off but honestly made me feel like i had lost my true self) The turning point for me was a relationship with a girl 2 years ago which was essentially meeting a person who was me in female form with a few extras, the relationship was toxic to say the least. We took drugs together, we fought alot, we argued alot. And even one time while drunk I had been struck by a partner. Now for someone who grew up with constant day in and day out physical beatings from my father to feel it from an outside source it hit home that i was wasting my life away. Chasing relationships that my mental health couldn't (and shouldnt) be in. So I removed myself from everything, removed all temptation, cut alcohol to ""special occasions"" and ""celebrations"" only (barring a few relapses). I invested heavily in myself (audiobooks, self care, self improvement) I took a look at the problems in my life and tackled them bit by bit, day by day. Before I continue I am in no way claiming that I am anywhere near where I want to be, infact just christmas past I relapsed horribly, drank an entire bottle of whiskey and picked a fight with my father on christmas eve and was kicked out of my family home, but in terms of what the fight was about I think I needed to say what I said.. the alcohol just didnt help how I presented the argument.. but in comparison to a year ago I am almost a new man.. I guess what message I'm trying to convey is, yes.. you will have your off days, you will have days where you wake up and you just want to tell the world to F*** off and pull your sheets over your head. But take it all day by day. Find things you want to be better at, make peace with your past, take the good with you and get rid of the bad and change what you can. There are countless books, videos, and people out there who can make each day easier. Mental health in my country (Northern Ireland) has now gotten to the point where more people have died from suicide since the troubles (essentially a civil war) than were murdered during that period of time (30+ years) which is crazy because it's still just not talked about here. But I've gained a lot of self respect and confidence through learning by myself and grinding it out. 

The phrase ""a day at a time, a step at a time"" was coined to me by an elderly gentleman at my place of work, he (70+) lived his life for his family, caring for his sick mother and father and due to this never married, never had kids, never had a family of his own. So in every right he had his dark days, burying every member of his immediate family before the age of 50. But he said to me on a day I was struggling and couldn't hide it... "" you know what my favorite thing in the world is... waking up first thing in the morning and saying ""Happy days, I've got another day of being me, let's go see what the world has for me today... and that's it.. just take it one day at a time... one step at a time and things will get better.. and I promise you that young man"" 

So have your bad days,
Have your good days, 
But do it all for you,
And be true to how you feel,
Grow where you can, 
And learn where you can.
Keep moving forward,
Be strong,
Be kind,
Be loved,
Be whatever you need to be
One day at a time,
One step at a time."
1072,how do you function in society as a depressed person,"so I've been depressed for a while, I was having thoughts of not wanting to live anymore at 8, and I'm 17 years old now. I do go to therapy and take meds but I'm not sure how much that helps. I also workout 1-2 times a week (since I found whenever I did a little each day or a few days a week I only ended up having motivation to workout 1-2 times a week so instead now I workout really hard on those days, i have noticeable muscle) which is probably a large contributor to why I haven't committed  suicide yet. Anyways, something that has been depressing me is the though of moving out and having to take care of myself, I don't think I can really do it. I've worked in the past, during that time was the closest I've come to suicide (i did overdose on pills) even though it was just 2 weeks cause normally I do constantly distract myself and I had nothing to distract myself with at work. How do other depressed people do it, like function in life and make a living? I wish things could stop moving so fast so I could take a break and focus on my mental health then focus on getting my life in order, but I guess that's not how things work. I'm expecting to be on my own in about 7 months, no friends, no job, no car, no money."
1073,Help I am 20 and need help/advice for my mum,"Hello there,

I am in a desperate suitation so what better than to come on Reddit. I am 20 years old living in the UK and my mother suffers from Mental health. She is my only family and I have no other family members with me, it’s just me and her. She is 40 years old and throughout my life it’s been a complete struggle. I’m mostly here for my mother and rather just go on about her as now I have stayed away from living at my home and now at a friends for a couple weeks, I have a clearer head. I am very knowledgeable about mental health however I feel like the support system for it isn’t GREAT, especially when you believe my mother doesn’t acknowledge her problems a greater deal than I do, and doesn’t want help, however you can tell, all my friends can tell that well she isn’t all there most days. For now I just want to copy and paste some of my thoughts on her mental health and what traits she has and if anyone could help me in any way especially in the UK on what I should do and what other under lying mental health issues she portrays I’m missing out or should consider to know please let me know. The GP is no help I’ve been there I will go again soon they say she has to come to us asking for help, I can’t just get someone sectioned like that, housing Association are aware of her living conditions and I do remember to think about my life too however I think my mother is so kind hearted below and I do love her, I wouldn’t want to live a life where I didn’t try my best first with her seeing if I could help her mental health out. 

Here are some of my 12am notes I’ve written down about her traits:

Severe depression to the point sometimes she can’t brush her hair or teeth. Been a ongoing thing for YEARS

Suffers somewhat anxiety to get out the car or acts quietly sometimes in public. Not extremely bad though really. 

Has extreme obsessions going on for years from constant messaging a famous guy saying she would very much like to meet him and she likes him very much to the point there she thinks there is a relationship with this man, looking into abortions constantly when not in need of one I think this is related to her past trauma but still goes on 20 years later, asks repetitive questions.

Also she speaks to herself at home or whilst driving. A lot of these conversations are from instagram.

Gets lost in her own thoughts whilst driving - having a scenario in her head and her speaking verbally out which then also affects her driving on main roads as she gets distracted.

She has extreme hoardering/clutter in her home so inability to look after herself or home fails to acknowledge the strain on her relationships and the impact it has due to this. Basically lives in safey and living hazard.

Sometimes forgets routes to common destinations she has driven to many times.

Her mood switches and gets bipolar one minute happy then a couple hours later get angry at nothing or suddenly cry.

When living with her gets extreme moments of anger and constant referrals to her ex husband even though there was a divorce 15 years ago.

Always changes subject when something needs to be addressed as if nothing was said in regards to the issue brought up calmly.

Has said previous counselling never has helped or will help and her life is just damaged/ruined.

Does not take her medication regularly at all, for many years. Only takes Prozac when her low mood gets extremely extremely low for a period then drifts/doesn’t care to take them.

So yeah I’m trying my luck here, I have a great support system of friends but I’m at the point I need guidance on what to do and how to help her she is only 40 and has all these mental illnesses i had to grow up with and had severe depression myself stages in my life from a young age as well.

Thank u for reading :)"
1074,how do i politely ask my bf to be there for me,i recently went through a very traumatic experience and i want my bf to be there for me and maybe be a little more attentive. is that selfish? or should i just like shut up about it and not expect people to help me?
1075,Talking,"I’m getting diagnosed with things/have been diagnosed with stuff. Starting a medication in a couple days to hopefully help one of them. 

But there’s one thing I have been afraid to talk about with my psychiatrist or psychologist. Partially because I don’t know what the hell it is or how to really explain it. 

But I shall try my best right now.

Basically, at certain points in time, my brain just disconnects from reality. It can last from a few minutes to an hour. 

- It feels like I’m watching a TV show instead of it being my vision. 

- All my senses are muffled (especially hearing). 

- I can’t recognize people that I know. 

- If I look in a mirror I don’t recognize the person staring back at me. 

- If I look at a body part, my hand for example, it doesn’t feel like mine. Like it doesn’t belong to me.

- I can’t remember almost anything while it’s happening and it’s hard to recall what happened after the fact

- I can’t remember who I am.

And I guess I’m wondering if I should tell my psychiatrist about this? The psychologist? Should I just let it happen? What even is this?"
1076,I'm trapped in my life,"Hi, so I suppose I should introduce myself. I'm an 18 year old college student in the UK and I never had much freedom in my life.

My current situation is that I'm living with my mum, and basically being a parent to my half brother. My daily routine involves me going to college, coming back home and taking care of my younger brother and then getting maybe an hour to myself before I go to bed. Then the cycle repeats. I baby sit my half sibling on Saturday but I did manage to get Sundays off to myself. However all I really do on Sunday is my school work as that's the only day where I get to catch up.

I can only leave the house on Sunday but there is nothing and nowhere for me to go then. Every place is closed and it's not like I have any friends. I don't find any enjoyment in going anywhere nowadays. I also don't enjoy staying in. Overall I just don't enjoy my life in general. I haven't had a conversation with anyone in a really long time and I have issues that hold me back in life.

The obvious thing do to would be for me to move out. Like come on, I'm 18 but I don't feel like I'm allowed to do that. The only way for me to move out would be for me to quit college as I would need to work enough to support myself financially. But then I would fall into the trap of living a day to day life with little potential for the future. 

I'm in college, working towards getting a good grade so that I can go to university but I don't know what I want to do. I wish I was studying different subjects but I can't change them at this point. I like those subjects but what I want to do is to tell stories through art. What I'm studying won't be completely pointless as I am learning a lot about society and other such things but I wish I could be doing something more creative.

At time point I really don't know what is wrong with me and what I want. I think I been lying to myself because I'm scared but I don't want to admit that. I feel like I live my life by following a set of rules that I didn't set up. It's like a set of rules that I just have to obey. The thought of breaking them scares me. If I'm ill and don't go to college, I feel anxious. 

I wish that I could rebel, do the things I'm not supposed to do. Be myself. I have to lie so much about who I am in real life. I really don't really take care of myself. And now that I think about it, I think it may be because I am not being me and haven't been me ever. 

I been thinking a lot today and came to a realisation today. I'm scared of breaking those rules and it's really holding me back. I suppose in a way I'm basically fitting into a norm that I'm supposed to fit into and I'm denying that I'm not like that, that I'm a bit different, that I'm weak and that I need help. But I am so scared. Lots of things make me anxious but a lot of those things are the things I enjoy. I'm scared of making any changed to myself or doing anything different."
1077,What the bananas is wrong with me?,"Mkay so. The other day, something weird happened. I texted my friend that sometimes i want to k*ll myself, backwards. Idk why I did it I guess I just wanted help. But I regretted it immediately. I wanted to kill myself for a solid ten minutes, then was okay. Then a little later, the weird stuff happened. I was convinced that I would fall through the floor and die. I was clawing at the floor, and walls. It was terrifying. I also had a weird urge to roll my eyes back in my head and collapse (yes I know how freaky this sounds I’m sorry) and then a little later, I was convinced my dad would kill me with his car keys. I think I knew how ridiculous I was being. I was scared of myself. I still am. I struggle with suicidal thoughts every now and then, and when that was happening, I felt like I would lose control and do it. I really don’t know what happened, or what to do. Should I see a therapist or something? Or is this a normal thing?.... idk I’m really lost here any help would be appreciated."
1078,New Jobs causing me heartache?,"Hey I recently started working as a labourer on a construction site, first time on a site like this an it's safe to say I'm anxious in that type of atmosphere.

Let me start by saying that getting this job was a long process, while I was sludging through that process my new boss made it clear that he wanted me to start working as soon as possible because I am needed. Which is funny because I've felt like the complete opposite since I started, I'm cleaning up after the workers but in the most minimal ways, I feel like he just creates work for me to do most of the time. I'm working with a friend of mine that tries to teach me about the electrics so I can do more work in the future but I don't want to learn any of that if I'm honest, the money seems great but It's just not something I want to pursue.
If there's some sort of Hierarchy in that workplace I'm right at the bottom, I'm incompetent because I don't know all the lingo an the names of the equipment we use, I can't do any of the electrical work too, even the simple stuff, because my hands shake like I have parkinsons, it's really made me lose all of my self-esteem. I don't know what I want to do with my self but I hate this job an the emotional pain I am feeling has give me heartache, something I thought could only happen from losing a loved one. Give me advice... please."
1079,My Healing Journal - New Personal Blog,"Hello everyone! I was diagnosed with complex-PTSD in March 2018 and have been working on my healing since. This week I've created a blog to continue to document my healing efforts and what I've been through. I'd appreciate it if you checked it out. :) The first post is me just sharing my story and intentions with creating a blog.

[https://medium.com/@healingisbeing/healing-is-being-ba453f5a3a4a](https://medium.com/@healingisbeing/healing-is-being-ba453f5a3a4a)

I cross-post between medium and Wordpress because I like the formatting options on Medium a lot better. I put content warnings on the post!"
1080,I went to therapy for the first time today.,"After going through a really tough adjustment period working in social work with people that have experienced the same traumas that I have, and talking to my boss about how it’s been affecting my anxiety, I started seeing a therapist through the employee assistance program. It feels so relieving to just be able to put it all out there and link everything together. She praised me for the comparison I made to re-experiencing trauma through work like this:

Everything I’ve been through has been broken down into like a 5,000 piece puzzle. Some of the pieces are right side up, some are upside down. As I go through my life and start to experience some healing, it’s like putting together the right side up pieces to finish the puzzle. Working with kids and remembering bits and pieces about my trauma  is like turning over pieces of the puzzle and realizing that some of the pieces I’ve already put in don’t actually go in that spot so it’s frustrating and causes me anxiety but it’s manageable. But then something chaotic happens and that’s like somebody messing up the puzzle and taking it apart, so I have to start over from whatever is left connected. 

She recommended we look into me being put on anxiety meds for the first time and continuing with some long term trauma response therapy to help me get better at my job. I’m excited to keep going and put the puzzle of healing together."
1081,Struggling with depression and anger issues,"I used to suffer from some really severe depression, I've gotten better but I have some severe anger issues. I break thing when I'm mad and today without hesitation I punched the laptop I saved up 4 years for. I need help for handling my anger in less destructive ways"
1082,Anyone on lexapro?,"I’ve been on 10mg lexapro for about six weeks for anxiety. 

Came out of a breakup that really flared up all my mental health struggles but have been actively working towards getting better because I believe a lot of what I struggle with is rooted in my thinking. So have been in therapy, doing my own CBT, reading, watching videos, lots of reflection and therapy, learning to self soothe and self love. 

I feel I made a decision after my break up. I was on a path of self destruction through drinking heavily and steering towards self harm again and really hating myself, chain smoking and not being able to function, and then I made a decision. Do I want to keep feeling this pain, or do I want to feel better? I decided I want to feel better. I want to be happy. And so I started the process. 

I don’t feel anywhere near as anxious anymore, but it’s hard to tell if that’s the lexapro or the shift in my thinking. 

After starting the medication though I have been SO tired. I struggle to sleep at night (which I have basically my whole life) but I used to still be able to wake up at a decent time. Now on lexapro, if I stay up late my body will not let me wake up until I’ve slept at least 10 hours. I actually think it’s made me lazier. I feel so cosy and content I don’t see the point in getting up. I’m basically in bed until 1pm in the afternoon. I just sleep and sleep and sleep. And then by late afternoon I’ll nap again for a few hours. I never used to be able to nap unless I was super tired.

I feel I actually used to have way more energy. Mentally I feel clear but physically I’m just tired all the damn time. If I go for a 30 min walk to try to energise and get exercise, I’m zonked out after. 

Went back to my doc about this and he said to start taking it at night to see if that helps the tiredness. It has a little, but now I get horrible night sweats and I spend all night having vivid dreams and nightmares and sweating through all my clothes and my bed. 

Anyway, what’s your experience with lexapro? I think I’m keen to go back to my docs to get off meds entirely."
1083,I don't know what's going on,"I started actually sticking to taking Zoloft, so maybe that's what's happening. I don't feel depressed anymore, but I feel weird. I was in a super bad depressed state for the past 3-4 months and then one day I feel very very good and happy, but now I feel no emotion. I feel like a different person and don't really remember a lot of past memories or how certain things made/make me feel. I'm not sad, I'm not scared, this is all fine for me, but I'm so confused. I don't think I'm the same person I was a week ago. It's so hard to explain what I feel but this is the best I can do"
1084,I’m feeling pretty down,"Ive been acting like a crazy person for the last two months. I think the people in my life are probably pretty sick or dealing with me. Every other day I’m crying to my boyfriend and having these weird panic attacks about death. I feel suicidal some days and perfectly normal others. I don’t want to die but I don’t have any control over my mind. I keep trying to channel it into exercise and art but it feels like I’m never going to escape. I know everyone is sick of it. I’m sick of it. I don’t know how this happened or where it came from but I’m really, really tired of hating myself for this."
1085,"My life feels mellow, boring, and I only feel happy when I’m on drugs or drunk. Am I alright?","For reference I am a 15 year old male. 

I definitely wouldn’t nearly describe myself as depressed, because I do my best in school, even if I cheat half the time, I get out of bed every morning, etc.

But I know I’m definitely not alright either.

I know I have some sort of mental illness or at least a very bad mental state because... nothing excites me anymore. Or at least, it does, for a second. Like when I went to San Juan, Puerto Rico for a trip, I was looking forward to going there all my life but when I got there everything was just so... underwhelming. There are few things I get excited by, and if I get excited by it, it lasts for like 5 seconds then I’m like, meh. 

I’m also lost in my own thoughts 24/7, and I sometimes feel “disconnected”, and have to touch something and feel myself to get reassurance that I know I am real.

I also get very annoyed with parents, I don’t have any “true” friends, just social, and no one in this entire world knows what’s going on inside me, which is why I like my own company and will get drunk and high on any drug when I get a chance.

Which also leads into the next, which is I only feel happy and curious and bubbly about the world only when I’m intoxicated on substances, never have I once felt genuine happiness while not sober. 

Anyway, that’s just a main jhist of my mental health. I could very well just be overthinking normal things, which I have a habit of doing, I even have mild social anxiety.

But please let me know If this is normal."
1086,"I doing a 10 page clinical brief on dissociative identity disorder and i need to pick 2 perspectives (psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, sociocultural, or biological) to explain the causes of it. which ones should i do?","i’m thinking psychodynamic and cognitive, but i’m not 100% sure."
1087,How do you quiet your mind?,"My mind just seems to always be massively active. Everything that I do, everyday, everything I see or hear, it’s just always analysing literally everything. It’s not always necessarily bad nor good thoughts, but it’s always just thinking about something, analysing, scrutinising. It’s fairly manageable most of the time but sometimes I feel burned out and stressed beyond measure. I just never seem to be able to have peace. The constant introspection is so consuming. Unusually, the only thing it doesn’t really affect is sleep. Is there a way to focus it? I have tried, with a good degree of dedication, meditating, playing soothing music, reading, etc. and to no avail. It always has something to say about something. I can’t think of any obvious trauma that has rendered it in such a damaged state, and I would not say my life is any more stressful than the average person. Is there anything that can be done about this? How do I turn it off, even if only for a little?"

1089,Anxiety/Addiction problem,"So I'm 13 year old boy. I am part of a ""faction"" on a video game platform. I am really invested in it, I feel that its partly due to the fun involved, but we also win money. I wanted to also mention that I'm one of the founders, and I find myself not obligated, but wanting to be able to participate due to it. I feel that if I dont participate I'm letting others down.

Since I was about 11, I get anxious and nervous about alot of things. For example in the video game we can get ""raided"" by enemy factions and I'm usually up until 11pm trying to see if they succeed or not. 

I also get nervous about other stuff, such as normal teenager stuff, school assignments etc. When I do feel this anxiety I feel empty in a sense. I feel no emotions other than nervousness. When I say empty I mean nothing els, just this anxiety for whatever it is I'm focused on.

Now I'm wondering how I can be more calm, and hopefully not have anxiety. I dont want to let the game down, because I enjoy it, but I need to find a way to make it not become so ""real"". Would meditation help, anything els? 

Thanks"
1090,I can’t take it anymore,"I’m having one of those surreal nights again. I don’t know how many of you know the type, when you just want to feel something, so all your physical senses are dialled to 11, because mentally/emotionally you are completely numb. I can see things in a whole different way that I can’t explain, and feeling textures and temperatures is far more prominent. I want to cry, I want to sob until there’s no water left in my body, but I can’t. I know the whole “I’m alive but not living” saying is cliché, but it’s terrifying when you realise to what degree it reigns true in your own life. I walk this planet each day, perform different activities, interact with friends and family, go to school, but it’s not for myself anymore. It’s not because I want to or have the will power or energy to. It’s just because I have to.

I’m alive, because I have to be. That’s all I have to say for myself.

I would say “I’m nearly 16, I should be out spending lots of time with my friends savouring it while I can having the time of my life” but it shouldn’t matter what age you are. No one should just be living because they *have* to, it’s torture. They should be living because they enjoy it and they *want* to.

I’ve been on this planet for 1 and a 1/2 decades; lots of people my age enjoy being here - but all I have left to show for myself is insomnia, a constant state of depression, these nights of sensory overload, and when I’m lucky, the odd glimmer of joy. Like, I had a surgery today, and though I was crying through the pain of the anaesthetic needle going into my foot, I couldn’t help but be relieved that I was feeling something real. I don’t want to live my life like this anymore, but no matter what I do I can’t seem to fix it."
1091,Anyone. Please. Help. I need some coping skills or something.,"FUCK FUCK FUCK

I feel like I’m going fucking INSANE. I can’t stop moving. I feel like my head is filling to the brim and I can’t stop it. My GOD this is fucking TERRIBLE. HOW DO I STOP THIS?!?!?

Someone. Please. Anyone. Help me slow my mind and my body. I don’t know how much longer I can take this."
1092,Mental health social experiment phase 1 of 3,"Introduction 

Psychopathy is a mental/personality disorder under the category of ASPD (Anti-social personality disorder). Psychopathy is a large array of complex psychological and behavioral symptoms. Psychopathy as associated with the term, crazy, you often see the stigma from time to time that psychopaths are future serial killers and they will start killing animals to slowly progress to murdering their own kind like the case of Jeffery Dahmer. Some of the symptoms of psychopathy and sociopathy, maybe a sort of cousin to psychopathy as they are under the umbrella of ASPD, symptoms to get started in this; (Psychological symptoms) a impaired ability to empathize with others, a sense of grandeur and a bold person, lack of guilt or remorse and a impulse of dishonesty. (Behavioral) Pathological lying, superficial charm, juvenile delinquency, is conning and manipulative and a possible promiscuous sexual life and behavior (This may not be in all cases though). 

Phase 1, 

Currently I am mentally ill in the head with a psychological illness my psychiatrist proscribed anti-depressants for. 

The social experiment is on going and the psychological examinations on the effects, the symptoms and the sights of psychopathy gives to a person's psyche. The way I conduct these testings as I keep the experiment a secret sense everyone involved is my psychological Guinea pigs and if my secret goes out, the whole thing will be shattered like pieces of glass under the pressure of a baseball bat. The experiment is a total success and is quite fun in my opinion and I know I am doing it right because I take extensive notes on the reactions I get or don't get in order to keep everything aligned and straight forward. What it all goes down to is putting a special mask over my true self and portraying myself as a mentally ill person who has, (1) Psychopathy, (2) Multiple personalities in one mind, (3) Schizophrenia. I'd be psychotic one moment pissed off and acting like a psychotic freak, beginning to choke that person, lightly but hard enough it hurts, Then I'd tell them I am sorry and start crying and hugging them, I snap from one personality to another in a snap of a finger. My experiment caused lots of fears against me and I am outcasted and shunned in the fear of classmates that lurks in the thick and dark fog, the haze of utter fear and blackness. 

Sometimes I will walk around with scissors in my hands and vaguely stalk and chase my ""Pray"" They run and scream like cattle as I relive devilish eyes that are so plain it is inhuman so I always get the response I need for my psychology notebook journal.

The way I do things is followed down at a memorized list of actions to portray mental illness, scare off people and list them in sections by reactions marked down by stars and crossed in my notebook pages confidential in my office box and now I shall share it with the internet to share my findings and discoveries of psychology. using psychopathy to filter a reaction from someone and continue the process everyday and every week of the month. 

 \-The behavioral acts- 

  \*The words I use are spoken in a monotone and plain voice that insights chills down the spines of my guinea pigs. 

  \*Give off vibes of ultimatums to people but really just bluffing. I got some girls address on a note and the girl said to me in a melancholic voice, a smile of nervousness on her face, ""P-Please do not come to my house, if you do, I won't answer the door."" after I said to her, ""I will be paying you a visit."" 

  \*Use dark humor as the main humor and say you don't care when you offend someone, I feel really bad saying this but I still said it though it was screwed up hard, I said it anyways because the black humor is my escape goat, 

   \*Use weapons to scare away people like scissors, prod around with it with taunting actions and don't be afraid to get your hands dirty. Kids moved across the classroom to stay away from me which lead to me getting a red card on valentines day that had a green heart at the corner saying, ""To my psychotic bestie."" In it it read in black marker, ""Hi CDL I just want to say thank you for being my psychotic best friend and being my bestie and thanks for all the great laughs. Happy day bestie, sincerely your bestie."" I am doing a good job. 

   \*Talk proudly about murder and about psychos like Ed Gein, Jeffrey Dahmer, the zodiac killer and have deep conversations on suicide which kids aren't to fond of. 

   \*Always carry a smile and create deep plans that are so complicated that it will take days to prepare. Someone hired me as their hit-man and told them to follow me on TOR and we will talk about it via private email. She knew I was knowledgeable about killing so she asked me to kill student C so over the weekend I spent all night looking for Student C's email account so I can arrange things in secret. The girl wanted me to kill student C, so I will contact student C and talk about it and stage herself tied in a chair and me wearing a wicker mask with a black fedora and slitting her throat but it is acting we both negotiated in secret. Student C doesn't show up for class, tell her to take a mental health day off so it seems I actual killed her when I show the girl who requested the killing the video and see what she'll do or say. 

Actions and responses 

The students always give off a nervous smile when ever I vaguely imply I am going to erase them off the face of the earth. Sometimes they would just stare nervously at me and I can see through the hellfire that is my eyes that they are scared, scared to the bone and just for extra character to seal the deal, I pull out a pare of barber scissors and raise it to my neck with clasped hands, student D who sits behind me, says, ""I do not trust you around that."" 

   ""Oh why not, Why not?"" I creak my head to the side so far that my sideburns graze the ends of my shoulders and the disks in my neck creak, snap and pop. 

   ""Is it because I am scaring you? WHY AM I SCARING YOU, GIRL?"" I  get up from my desk and drop the blade to the floor with a metal crash, then silence as I put my hand on her chin and get in her face, white beating eyes staring deep into her. 

   ""Come on, don't be shy."" Everyone in the rows scoots their desks back and watch in shock with some even walking away and across the classroom for safety. 

   A lot of the time I natural do these things and act creepy on accident as my experiment is slowly interfering with my life. So indeed this is the answer to what the response of younger generation society responds to a person with raging anti-social personality disorder is resentment of upper classmates, fear and nervousness, intimidation that ruptures deeply in your peers but this may just be the beginning of my social experiment, I will find out what I will find out for stage two and three, or will there even be one at all at this point in time? They fear me now like the cattle against the sound of guns busting smoke and bullets into their peers, they resent and flee, resist and run. 

  I think that the next month I will create a false sense of security and at friendly and nice and see what happens when I turn devilish.

1093,I am tired of advocating for inclusivity.,"Recently in my country, there has been cases of people getting into trouble with the law because of their mental health conditions (ASD, OCD, trauama). Whenever I pass by such threads and see the comments of laypeople calling for people with mental health issues to be hospitalised, remanded in prisons, or simply isolated from the rest of the world ""until they are fixed"", I cannot help it but jump in to advocate about the perspective and struggles of both clients and therapists working together to cope with mental health issues.

Over time, repeated arguments of non-existent risks that simply manifested from their lack of understanding of mental health issues becomes a draining fight, while getting downvoted for every single request to be more understanding and empathising towards inability to meet social norms becomes suffocating.

How do you guys keep going with the fight? Would love to have some positivity to keep my morale up."
1094,feeling a little suicidal again because my abuse is never taken seriously,"this is more of a vent however   


in my country when ever a major case of domestic violence comes across headlines the same exact thing inevitably happens the conversation turns to all men are abusive all men deserve to die should all men be monitored men deserve harsher punishments for anything they do all men will commit rape men men men men men  


honestly i am so mentally fucking exhausted of this because and i'm sorry if this offends anyone but women simply cannot know what it is like to be a man who has been raped and physically abused you honestly cant because you are not taken seriously and when ever you try to say ""hey i was abused domestic violence happens to men too"" you are just dismissed as ""oh well hes an MRA don't pay attention to him""   


i get laughed at told i deserved it (usually in the context of well a woman just got her own back) told i'm making it up i am so fucking sick of it  my mother beat me i was in two abusive relationships one was manipulative the other one was was violent and actually drugged me once when i had flu and didn't want to have sex   


i am sick of being told daily that i am this born asshole who deserves everything bad that ever happens to me because of whats between my legs i can't actually date anymore for fuck sake i have a phobia of women showing interest in me now i get panic attacks i need to carry around beta blockers    


i tried getting this but was told its still a taboo subject and that they don't have resources for things like this so they instead focused on my combat PTSD thinking it would fix the romance phobia but it never did   


i don't know how to end this but just every time this kind of thing happens in the media the resulting conversations cuts me down and each time it gets worse and worse and i feel like at some point there's going to be a stage that i cannot mentally handle it anymore"
1095,I'm paranoid and its seemingly getting worse,"I have been paranoid for a very long time. Im terrified people are after me and trying to kill me. I'm not going to get too much into my history but I use to also suffer with severe depression and anxiety but my depression is mostly gone with the help of therapy. I am 21f living for the first time on my own for university and I struggled a little bit last semester but this semester has been relatively smooth and with just adopting my dog, I really felt I could comfortably live in our family vacation home by myself. I stopped triple and quadruple checking the locks, I didn't always lock my bedroom door, I opened 2 blinds from the windows and even turned the kitchen light off at night. But last night I woke up and it sounded like someone was in my house. My heart was pounding out of my chest and I texted my mom over 200 miles away to call the police because "" what if they heard me? They would sure kill me then!"" The police showed up at 4am not more than 5 minutes after I had texted my mom and they couldn't get inside because well the doors were locked. How is there supposedto be an intruderinmy home if the cops cant get inside. I left my room to open the back door which is less than a foot away to let them in. They searched my house and got nothing but were reassuring me that's this is okay and that I can call at any time. I feel ridiculous that I thought someone was in my house and that I heard voices inside. I feel like I hallucinated the voices and my paranoia because they didn't find anything to justify that I heard voices. I barricaded my door before laying in bed tonight. I'm so scared that even though no one was in my house yesterday. They're going to come back today. I feel like I haven't progressed at all. I feel like I lost all that progress and I need someone to live with me again. 

Tl;Dr
I thought there were people in my house last night but I also think I am hallucinating the voices because the cops found nothing and I'm terrified."
1096,Insomina help! (Medication advice),"I’ve recently been through a bad time and was prescribed fluoxetine 20mg - took it for 6 days but by day 4 the side effects became unbearable so I stopped the meds with doctors advice and took some daily doses of diazapam to help me relax and sleep (anywhere between 2mg-6mg a day) after about 2/3 days of this this stopped working and I would wake up in the night randomly anxious and covered in sweat. Since then I’ve been to see a psychiatrist and he prescribed me quetapine starting at 50mg.
I took it for one night and one night only - it helped me sleep more but still my sleep was disturbed. Does anyone know if it’s okay to just stop taking quetapine after just one dose? I’ve tried looking online and can’t find any information. It’s 2.40am hère, i went to sleep around 11 and woke up at 1am keep averaging 2 - 4 hours (if I’m lucky) sleep a night and it’s becoming excruciating! Anyone have any advice? Thank you :)"
1097,Does anyone use Lemonaid?,"I was looking into getting some consultations and such, but there are not a lot of great (or affordable) resources locally where I am. Has anyone had any luck or experience with Lemonaid? I was looking at that or Brightside, but I can't find much information about it online. I live in Colorado in the US."
1098,How to enter therapy?,"Hi guys, this has probably been answered before but I just haven't found the post. 

I'm feeling motivated to finally start therapy as I've been on the fence about it for about a year. I'm just so intimidated by the process. Where do I even begin? Do I need a referral from a doctor? I'm scared to call places and ask because I don't want to come off stupid (I'm sure they won't see that way but I have a really hard time asking for help - one of the many reasons why I'm seeking therapy along with childhood traumas that are bubbling to the surface more and more each passing day) 

I don't know anyone that has gone to therapy - or maybe I do know someone but they just haven't shared - so I don't know who to ask for advice. Any time I bring it up to my mom she suggests ""holistic"" coaches and basically people who aren't trained to deal with what I'm dealing with. To give you more of an idea of what's going on in case that can get me some more specific answers, I'm feeling very depressed. I have for a while. But it's gotten to an almost debilitating state and I feel so directionless and hopeless that I can't make a move at all in any area of my life. Any articles I find just feel like fluff pieces that don't actually offer a step by step on how to get an appointment. They tell me to ""start calling places!"" but for someone like me that's hard. What places do I call? What do I tell them? Ugh... Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance."
1099,My mental health is now affecting my job,"I’m at a loss. I’ve had depression and anxiety for 11 years now. I’ve been on and off every type of medication with little to no help. As I’ve gotten older, I would say my anxiety has ramped up more (thank you adulthood) and I have been able to manage my depression to an acceptable level. Right now I’m not on any medications. The last couple of weeks at my job have been pretty stressful- we are short staffed, and I took on a project that I originally thought wouldn’t be as difficult as it has turned out to be. I’ve now (for the first time in 11 years) been experiencing what I’m assuming to be physical symptoms of anxiety (heart racing, heart feeling like it’s pounding out of my chest, can’t catch my breath, nausea) for the last couple of weeks. My supervisor took me aside  today and brought up that she has been receiving news that I’ve been negative lately and it’s bringing down everyone at my job and they are worried about me. It took me by surprise because I think I’ve always been pretty good at my job with not being extremely negative because I know how annoying those people can be. I voice when I’m stressed but I typically make a joke out of it and people never reciprocated negatively. I’m just confused and disappointed in myself. I made a doctors appointment for myself in 2 days to make sure everything with my heart is okay and it’s just anxiety and then to discuss going on anxiety meds (again, for the 15th time). I’m trying to think positively about it but I’ve tried SO many different anxiety medications and none have helped. I’m not good at faking being happy so I’m pretty worried about what might happen if these medications don’t help. I wish I didn’t have to work and I could take a couple of weeks off. If you’ve read this far, thanks for listening to me vent, and if you’ve been in a similar situation I would love to hear your story. Mental illness sucks."
1100,Song a friend made,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=txWiNoft47s
1101,Damn,Can't talk normal to girls I like. Totally fuck it up every time. I'm fuckin 28. God damn it.
1102,I just need someone to talk to,"I just need someone

Hi my name is Maxx and I’m 18 and a male. I’m in high school right now and well it’s been easier for me. School isnt a problem for me, I actually do quite well and don’t tend to need help with anything. It’s just that a lot has been happening in my life lately and I don’t know what to do and figured someone here might be able to help. Now to what is wrong, I used to live in Florida and I was doing good out there and was fairly happy had doing well mentally out there, but I had to move from Florida back to Illinois, where I was raised. I lived with my mom and she got sick and we lost our house and a lot of stuff happened and I had to move back to Illinois. When I moved back I was 17 and I’ve been having mental health problems since. I even tried to kill myself once by cutting my vein, but I guess I didn’t cut deep enough and I happened to be in my car so I was driving on the highway and drove into a ditch going 120mph and didn’t have a seatbelt on. I though that would kill me but I ended up just braking my back and was fine otherwise. I convinced my family the large cut on my arm was from the glass from the window. I’ve had no prior mental health history so they believed me and besides I hadn’t talked to them often when I lived in Florida so no one knew if I had problems. They made me see a therapist once to make sure and I lied about it all and said it was just an accident. Recently my sister and stepmom got into a fight and my stepmom left for a week and I was worried we lose our house like I did in Florida and I stressed out quite a lot from that. She didn’t tell us where she was and really I didn’t care because she is a bitch as is, but she finally came home. A lot else has happened too but all this is just the recent things. My grandma had also went to the hospital at the same time and I was worried for her and I had to watch her house while she was in the hospital. She is fine now it was just stressful then. I live in a lower-middle class house hold and I work to get money for myself and to pay my medical bills from my car crash. The bills add up to over $5k and I’m only 18 and I’ve been paying them since it’s happened. The problem is my boss hates me for whatever reason. It’s not like I’m a bad worker or I have a bad attitude towards her, I work in retail and do my job (in my opinion) well. I recently was sick, as it’s that time of year, and it was around the holidays and I still went to work for 4 days in a row while still attending school. My other managers I was working will all said I was really sick and should take a day off and I did. My manager got mad at me and cut my hours down to 4 hours a week. Then the other week i had a few drinks because I was stressed and sprained my foot like an idiot. It happened on a Thursday and I had work Friday and Saturday. I called off Friday because I couldn’t walk and I gave plenty of time to find someone else to work and even went in on Saturday. My job we aren’t allowed to sit down unless we are on break so it’s a lot of walking and I worked open to close Saturday. My boss has taken me off the schedule for 3 weeks since it’s happened and I’ve been looking for another job and the stress has just kept on pilling up. Then this morning came around and I’ve been having problems with my stomach lately and was violently getting sick at 4 in the morning. My dad didn’t believe me and just told me to go to school and ignored the rest I had to say. Then my grandma came to take me to school and I said I was sick and wasn’t going. I’ve been sick for a couple weeks and haven’t been able to keep down food unless I smoke thc before eating. My dad is fine with me smoking and it helps with my stress and my back, along with my stomach. So my grandma and I started to argue and I felt bad because she got out of the hospital a couple days ago. I just didn’t want to go to school and I said some things about my dad and him not caring, because he hasn’t shown it or even acted like it at all. I understand he is stressed too but I mean he just doesn’t ever listen and if he does he just yells at me. He is a good father, don’t get me wrong, but lately he’s only been making it harder for me and hasn’t even seemed to care the least about me. My moms family had disowned me when I moved to Florida with her, except for a few people, it’s a large family. I just want help and I hate talking to therapists because I was forced to see one when my parents got a divorce and I just don’t like them. I’ve seen 4 different ones for various reasons, none really related to any of my problems, and I just don’t like them. I don’t like telling them about my problems. So I came here. Please help."
1103,Never happy.,I don’t want to talk to a therapist because I don’t want to be judged. Even now it feels weird trying to explain what I’m feeling. For years I’ve been constantly depressed or irritable. Why is my happiness so fleeting?
1104,I use to self harm...... but still have my blade that I used but haven’t used it for a while but can’t bring myself to throw it out.,"I used to self harm, but I couldn’t bring myself to throw out my blade. I don’t have thoughts about hurting myself anymore as I went through therapy and got my help from my doctor. My boyfriend has helped a lot too.(he doesn’t know I have it tho) any advice as to what I should do?"
1105,It's like someone's trying to kill you but it's yourself so you can't hide,"It's probably been said or thought before but I thought about it and thought I'd post it. I have suicidal thoughts/intrusive thoughts most days and about literally anything. Like hey there's a hard surface that could hurt your face. Yeah I've been thinking about smashing my head into a lot of things lately.

(Also dw I am waiting for therapy)"
1106,Clarity For Once...,"Sitting here, trying to hold back the tears when I dont even know why I'm crying. I don't feel strong right now, but I feel like I need to be. I want to feel something other than this for once."
1107,Distance,ifucking hate distance. I think most people do hate distance when there is someone across the States that you love. What sucks more then anything is I feel so useless and out of place. Like when I come out her I have so much anxiety and I guess like having mental illness and adjustment disorder doesn't help me out. Like I have a loving family and boyfriend but when im out here I constantly feel like they don't love me Even though in reality they do. I get anxious and upset about every little thing. Don't get me started about time difference and all that shit.
1108,Why did I have to be born into a family with mental health problems!? It ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. Everyday is a struggle. My anxiety is so high I feel like I’m not real. All day everyday!,
1109,"I’m a therapist - concerned about working with others in a VERY small town that know about my past substance hospitalization. How to handle directly working w them, daily, as my new coworkers, one of them would have been my supervisor. No idea how to handle this.","To anyone that works in mental health/social work...I am a therapist living and working in a very small community. I lost my former potential job during the hiring process due to substance issues. Now, I’m currently employed the ONLY other mental health agency I can work for here. The company I had applied to and didn’t work for is falling to pieces, and the two people (one would have been my supervisor, one my coworker) will now be working by my side, again because there is nowhere else to even apply to work. The individual that would have been my coworker actually evaluated me at our local hospital (post meeting me during my interview there) when I was a mess at the time. It was a huge mistake, I’ve been sober since, and literally no one else knows. Less than 10 people work in my current company, and I’ll be alone with them most of the time so I can’t imagine avoiding the topic. I do trust their abilities as therapists, for example regarding confidentiality. Issue - my “possible former” supervisor never saw me as a client but clearly knows why I lost the job, so confidentiality does not apply there, I think. I’m at a loss with how to handle this. ANY advice is appreciated."
1110,How do I die painlessly?,"My life is nothing more but pain, loneliness, and sadness. I have no will to live and I have nothing that makes me happy anymore. My parents don't care about me, I have no true friends, I'm a piece of crap. Don't give me your ""it'll get better"" since we all know it doesn't, everyday it gets worse. If you have no real answer then don't post because I'm not here for sympathy. Google tells me nothing, I'm not looking for a crisis line."
1111,I just feel so dull,"I’m a senior (M) in high school, and I’m just so bored and I feel so dulltbh. I’m incredibly bored and unstimulated in school. This year I’ve really just kept to myself at school I can’t really stand anyone there and I really only have one friend I hang out with outside of school. I have a beautiful girlfriend who’s incredibly sweet and caring but I honestly don’t seem to feel much from the relationship which is upsetting to me. I havent been doing much outside of school besides a little bit of video games, YouTube, music. I haven’t always been like this in fact I used to really enjoy high school and spend more time with friends but I just don’t really care anymore. I’m not really depressed necessarily, I get out of the house just fine I don’t really feel sad so much as just frustrated as to why nothing is really bringing me joy. I play soccer one night a week and that’s fun but it’s just one night a week. I can’t really find anything that makes me happy and keeps me stimulated. I don’t know what to do."
1112,First time seeing a psychiatrist; should I mention disorders I think I may have?,"Well, it’ll be more like seeing a psychiatrist of my own free will. I was hospitalized and diagnosed with MDD a little over a year ago after a suicide attempt. 

Though, I’m not convinced that their diagnoses were very accurate. Their questions just made it seem like they were saying “you either have depression, anxiety, both, or neither” and those were the only options. I still feel like there’s something wrong with me that isn’t being addressed. 

I currently experience symptoms of social anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and body dysmorphia and don’t know where to begin in talking about them to a doctor. 

Would it be ignorant/unhelpful for me to speculate disorders I may have based on my symptoms or should I only share what I’m experiencing that makes me feel this way without mentioning any diagnoses?"
1113,I’m going to the doctor tomorrow to talk about medication for anxiety. Would it be weird to ask for medication when I only have mild anxiety and situational anxiety?,"I’ve had some mild to moderate levels of anxiety while in college. The biggest issue for me is I have a lot of anxiety around driving and I’ve have panic attacks while driving. Now I’ve had to pull over a few times and one time had to call my bf while on the highway because I was freaking out so bad. Is this bad enough to warrant needing medication though? I don’t have a constant sense of anxiety, it’s just when I’m in situations like that or when I have a lot going on (work, school, personal life)."
1114,i don’t know where else to post this,"for over a year now i have been paranoid. every single day that passes by i feel incredibly uneasy. I used to think that it was just because I wasn’t getting enough sleep, but no matter what I do the paranoia never ends. I am incredibly uneasy about certain things that just stay and click, for example I will be fully convinced that someone will be following me everywhere and every time i turn around they have already been studying my every move, therefore they already know where to hide. Undistinguishable chatter like loud talking around me; knowing that people are talking but unable to fully distinguish what they are saying really freaks me out. I get very offended very quickly and when i hear that chatter i always hear them talking about me. I start to feel uncomfortable about my posture and hand and feet placement and always end up feeling very very uneasy. I always feel them making fun of me. I feel like my friends do the same when I can’t hear them properly, but seem like i can hear them. The days I do not get much sleep I’ll hear whispers, sometimes identifiable sounds and voices and i’ll ask the people around me and they wont hear anything, I always tell myself that it’s not real and that I am just tired, but it’s always very difficult for me to decipher what is reality and what is in my head. Not only that, but I will have these dreams while I am asleep about certain real life people that I have only seen never communicated with, and become extremely uncomfortable with them in person because I feel like all that in my dream also happened in reality, but I tell myself that I can’t be uncomfortable by something like that but I can’t help it. I feel in a way that I am special, and that some how everything is a sign meant for me and that everyone really is taking and looking at me. I don’t want to get into too much, but if any of this is in any way relatable please comment."
1115,Feeling antsy about a big move but not in the way you think,"So I don't really know if I'm posting this to vent or get advice but oh well, why not both? As of right now, I live in Southern California and I'm planning on moving up to Oregon. I'm living with some family friends right now because my dad lost his apartment about a year ago and didn't have the means to take care of me. I have a job and I'm not really getting very many hours, I'm 17 right now but my birthday is next week and I am very excited to be an adult. When I turn 18 I'm planning on reapplying to a grocery store that's near me and hopefully that will be full time, and I'm going to be taking a high school exit exam in March.

All this is to say that I've been forced to grow up very quickly, I used to take care of my younger brother when our mother would go out drinking and come back and hit me. Admittedly, I've seen a lot in my life so far and I'm very antsy to get out of my city. I know I can't do it right now but I feel so antsy living where I am and I've lived in the same county my whole life and I just want to get out of here.

I have no savings and no job lined up where I'm moving and I haven't even ever been to Portland, but my uncle thinks that I would love it up there so I'm giving it a shot.

I'm very antsy and can't stop looking at apartments in Portland but it doesn't even make sense for me because there's no way that I could move until at least June or July. Does anybody understand what I mean?"
1116,Most irritating thing,"So I was visiting family and the topic of depression and anxiety came up. I spoke up about my experiences with both then my uncle  says bullshit, you’re too young to be depressed. I hate when that shit happens. You don’t know how hard it is for me to get out of bed in the mornings and take a smile when all I want to do is cry. Ever since that statement today I’ve been in a funk. I went to therapy today and my therapist said you are in a better mood and I’m glad your not crying but if you need to feel free.  She also told me to love myself, take care of myself, and give myself me time! I’m going to take her up on that."
1117,i like to pinch and bite symmetrical pressure points on my body??,"unless I’m actively focused on relaxing my body, if my mind is moving, so is my body apparently. I do this thing where I pinch the skin of my anginas as well as the little skin curves between the bases of my fingers on both hands. I used to pinch and dig my nails into many more areas, such as in the middle of my palms, right underneath the kneecap of each knee and right underneath where the chin meets the neck. I have been biting my lips and my cheeks for as long as I can remember. my old therapist proposed that it’s just anxiety, but I pinch and bite pretty much all day every day, especially when my mind is on fire (usually if I have to concentrate my attention on something, like reading or listening to someone talk). is this maybe add or something? I’m not sure what it is but it always feels soooo good and honestly needed. any suggestions?"
1118,Why do I feel so good now that I've been diagnosed?,"For the past few months things have been really hard for me, after my situation changed in life. I always thought that I could get out of any ""funk"" by doing healthy positive activities--but I began to notice that regardless I remained feeling ""off"".

I decided to go to a therapist, and she gave me inventories and it turns out I have moderate depression, and possibly some OCD tendencies.

For some reason I feel really relieved. Like, I'm not making this all up--I'm going through something and now I have a roadmap and strategies to work through it.

Anyone ever experience this?"
1119,Mental Health Pen Pal,"Hello,

Would anyone be interested in being a mental health pen pal with me? I heard about the concept recently and thought it sounded really neat. To disclose a little bit about myself: I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, ADHD, and GAD a few years ago and it seems as though the bipolar could actually be BPD.

1120,Broke down today,"I had a panic attack today at work. Boss called me to her office to tell me that I made a mistake but it wasn’t a conversation.  I absolutely am no good with being confronted when there’s talking down involved and I felt like a complete idiot.  

My response to her was that I’m human and we are over loaded with work. My response should have been to just say okay and tell her I’d fix it.  She got more pissed off at me. I went to my office and the tears started coming down so I went to close the door so that no one would see me.  She took that as me slamming the door (my door shuts hard on its own) and called me back to her office to give me a write up.  She wrote that I have issues with making mistakes then went to list any mistake I’ve ever made in the past year, how I lost control and slammed the door, talk back and the list goes on and on. 

I tried to explain to her that I didn’t slam the door but she yelled at me more and told me that I’m not there to talk to her. I was there to read the write up and sign in.  She also said that I don’t need to act like a 5 year old.  That I should grow up.  I ended up writing my reasoning on the page and she walked away smirking.  I love my job but situations like that drive me more anxious.  

I hate that I’m always on the defense but today was just overall a shitty day."
1121,"I’m abusing alcohol, not doing my uni work and taking drugs, I feel like shit and I don’t know what to do, I don’t feel like I can tell my family, can anyone recommend anything",
1122,"Should I talk to my GP about my mental health, what should I ask and say?","I haven't had a psychiatrist/psychologist in over four years but I really need one. I have no idea where to start or look. I can go to my GP right now, I just don't know if it's necessary or what I should really say. Please help."
1123,How do I tell my therapist I have a plan to commit suicide?,"I have a plan to commit suicide and know I need help so I won’t do it. I am seeing a fairly new therapist and don’t feel very comfortable being blunt with her, but I’m scared for my life. I don’t want her to freak out but I need help. What do I do?"
1124,Falling apart,"I had a breakdown last week and tried to overdose on sleeping meds. All it did was fuck up my stomach and make me pretty lethargic for a few days... All because I self destructed and ruined a relationship with a friend. I had made plans to go see them after an interview close by and well, 1 conversation led to another and I lost control of my emotions and I said some things that I shouldn't of... It sucks because she was one of the only people I had left to talk to about my problems and she genuinely helped me a lot over the last 6 months. But after how I treated her, I just want to disappear. I've been trying this week to do better and get out on my own, but there's a part of me that's just missing now and I find myself crying or having a panic attacks every night. 

Idk... I just feel better when I can talk to someone. Its probably why I started writing these on here. Even if no one reads it, I was able to write it down and get it out there you know?"
1125,"Finding a private psychiatrist in the UK, help","I've been saving up for over a year and now have enough money to see a private psychiatrist and pay for it myself. I was wondering if anyone in the UK has experience with seeing a private psychiatrist and if anyone has any advice?

I have been in and out of treatment for years now but no one knows whats going on with me. I've been treated for (had therapy and meds) depression, anxiety, psychosis, symptoms of PTSD and have a tic (but am not officially diagnosed with anything but have my psychiatric notes and that's the stuff mentioned). It's all so vague there's a mention of ""possible personality disorder"" in one paragraph from 4 years ago and no ones ever mentioned it since, it's just there ??? What's the point if no one ever investigates further ??? I am tired of all this vague nonsense.

I'm 25 and have never had a job, dropped college multiple times, got into uni then dropped out of uni in January 2015 due to an episode of psychosis (I was treated for this but no diagnosis), I have no friends due to self-isolation and for the life of me I cannot get my life together which I am beginning to despise and hate myself for - life feels utterly hopeless."
1126,How is involuntary hospitalization helpful and not detrimental?,"While I understand what involuntary hospitalization is trying to do, it seems like pulling someone away from their life and giving them thousands of dollars in medical debt while also making it so they lose at least a weeks pay and possibly even be fired from their job would cause so many more problems than it helps. Especially when so many people say that even taking a sick day or two would cause significant financial strain. 

I'm someone that cant really afford to miss work and while my financial situation blows, it's not the biggest factor in my suicidal ideation. If I was hospitalized for feeling suicidal for my other reasons and got out to the additional financial mess, you can bet Id be pushed into full blown active attempts immediately.

Maybe theres something I'm missing but it just seems like it would cause way more problems than it helps..."
1127,Working with the Public,"Working with the public has got to be the worst.  I've worked off and on with over a decade now with the public.  On top of general animalistic issues with people, there are personal domestic issues.  Some people have come to my work, threatened or insulted me.  I have come a long way from losing my self control.  I have never attacked anyone in cold blood, I've only lost control and started raging in the past.  It's been years and I'm quite proud, it still gets hard.

This is my job, I can't afford to lose right now do to financial obligations.  I have to get the hell out of this Demonic infested village though.  It's a university town, I've mentioned in the past, there are cults here.  There are cults in many towns, in Universities there are several cults.  This isn't something typically discussed, you know of some of those big cults, many are still under the radar.  I have no idea what branch or relation these local cults have with bigger ones (Involving the Gods)? 

I was targeted years ago and only idle threats and irregular incidents of harassment have transpired.  There had been some incidents of hostility over the years, nothing I'm not game for.  Then people turned the shit around on me for not leaving.  Like, I'm obliged to go to battle with these people, then people got mad at me. I don't do anything, I stay in, told the cops everything.  I've mentioned how difficult the situation is and I'm just encouraged to leave town.

 It's funny fucking world we live in where a criminal mob of idiots get to screw people. The Authorities are obligated to dissolve the one person to control the situation.  So I keep my head down, I really don't do anything, this had been going on years.  I didn't mean to be here this long and now it's been 6 years and I'm burdened to stay 1 more at least to get finances together.  I had been piss poor for years, just found a moment and decent paying job to try and relax and enjoy some novelty before resuming destitution.

I get all psyched out when these people come around.  Nothing ever seems to happen.  They would come to my apartment, shout and threaten me, drive off.  I never give in to chase them, I'm certain I'm the one that will get fucked by the police.

It's exciting at times.  I've been out of the military 10 years.  It's the only action I get is these local G's.  

It's screwing up my life though, I was alienated and also kind of alienated myself with my behavior.  I had also joked about being schizophrenic at times and I'm really not.  It's not a situation I can get out of, it's just fucked.  However, I was alienated as delusional before I started joking about it.  I don't even care, perhaps I can redeem myself in time and actions.  I had some issues in the past, those had been remedied, and I came clean about drug and alcohol use.  I composed myself and with therapy and guidance had really come to realize it's a phase most people go through.

When all this started I co-operated with police to the best of my abilities.  Nothing amounted to shit as these people exploited the cops multiple times.  Calling them never helps as they show up and I am assless with no evidence.  I had tried to acquire evidence, license plates, frequent establishments, finger prints, addresses, pictures, video, witness testimony.  These people are really good at exploiting the law.  

These cults, human trafficking, slavery, came into question.  I was told to keep my wits about me before I got kidnapped, and sold off to some people that were going to wear my little asshole out, torture and murder me.  

I don't fear a lot, that's some dark shit to go through though."
1128,"Weird mental ""situation"" that happened often when I was younger","This may or may not be the place to post, but something that I considered normal when I was younger is really plaguing me now that I'm older. 
This weird 'mental thing' ( I have no vocabulary to name this) no longer happens, I'm in my 40s, but happened a lot as a child and faded in my twenties. I never made a big deal of it because when it happened it was just ""normal"". I found myself thinking lately as to why this no longer happens, which then leads my thinking into why this even occurred in the first place.
I'll try to explain. 
From as long ago as I can remember, my 'thoughts' sort of faded into the back of my head and other thoughts not my own would come forward.... Sometimes it was random sounds or talking I couldn't understand.  I could feel this coming on and would just think ""ok here it goes"". Nothing frightening but I could 'feel' a change happening. My own mind just waited in the background until the episode was over.... Usually a few minutes.... Then it faded. I could function as I still had control and was fully aware of what was happening. 
It really is hard to explain.  
There was not anything specific that would happen before it occurred. It was always completely random and occurred frequently. This happened, as far as I can remember, into my twenties. I basically just ignored when it happened and kept doing what I was doing until it went away. 
What the hell was happening? I can't seem to let this go."
1129,I'm happier... but part of me is still suicidal?,"I'm in a much better place than I was a few months ago. But I still find myself feeling hollow at times. Like I wish something horrible would happen to me. Get hit by a car, stabbed, contract an illness... I dont know, I still feel a strong urge to just fade away or disappear. Sometimes I don't know why I'm still here. Like I'll be happy for now but it wont last and I'll wish I could have ended my life while it was still at its peak, rather than having to lose what I had."
1130,"Is there a place on reddit that I don’t have to share something, but just say I’m not okay?",
1131,I cut myself for fun,"I just cut myself for the first time in a little while, but it wasn’t because I was sad or anything - I was just bored. The thing is, I don’t really feel much in my day-to-day life, to the point where it becomes a problem. 

For example: I’ve been cheated on (and I’ve cheated) and it hasn’t effected me in the slightest. No feeling of anger, sadness, or anything. 

It’s hard for me to socialize because I never know how to react in situations because I just don’t really care. Cutting gives me a little glimpse into what excitement/ sadness feels like (and it feels really good imo), so whenever I’m bored I cut."
1132,I am done with taking medications. My mental health is declining. Suicidal ideation is coming. This is how it always goes.,"After two years of trying different medications, I’ve decided I had enough of that. So for the past two weeks I’ve been on no meds. 

I feel like I low energy, no motivation, unable to do basic self care like showering every day, my brain is feeling like mush. I can’t work. I don’t know what else to do. Then I start feeling like I’m better off dead. I have a little energy for planning a suicide. But not enough energy to actually go through with the plan. 

How do you improve your mental health without medications?"

1134,Just venting,"my family found out about my self harm, I can't find a therapist, and I fear I'm becoming a danger to myself and others. I can't do this anymore. I shouldnt've been born if I were born just to suffer. I'm this close to stabbing either myself or someone else in the chest"
1135,I'm tired of being upset.,"I feel like it's a personality trait for me at this point to be sad.  I want to say I've accepted it but I haven't not even after years of the same feeling. I'm tired of being upset but were at the point where the feeling of overwhelming sadness and anxiety is so fond to me that I'm afraid that if happiness does come my way I'll push it away. I'm not going to waste your time. My reason for posting is because I've always known something is off for me but I've never been formally diagnosed with anything and I feel like if I'm able to put a title on these feelings I'll be able to distance myself from them.  So if you know what I might have please comment... These are my symptoms. 

1. Constant unsourced and sourced sadness.
2. Angry outbursts.
3. Violent mood swings.
4. Anxiety that causes my chest to seize.
5. Alchohol, TCH and nicotine dependency.
6. Easy to make friends but hard to keep friends.
7. Low energy.
8. Unable to eat.
9. Sudden urges to stop speaking even in mid sentences.
10. Sudden tremors.
11. Uncontrollable shaking in stressful environments. 
12. Cutting in the past.
13. I can carry conversations with my own inner voice and refer to different sections of my personality in the third person.
14. Sudden feeling of impending doom.
15. Suicidal thoughts in the past.
16. Uncontrollable Impulses.
17. Feeling lonely even when receiving attention. 
18. Unable to get over small problems.

Listen, my family is not very supportive and have a very distorted view on mental health which prevents me from reaching out conventionally.  They view mental disorder as a stain on themselves or making it seem like they are bad parents. I'm trying everything at this point I am so tired of not being able to be happy or get over small issues like everybody else. I wanna know why and I want to know how to fix it.  If anyone can help Id appreciate it."
1136,Yo IDK PLS help,"Please help

Hey, not sure what to say, or how this will even help me. I think about death all the effing time. About how life is meaningless. Everyone dies sometime. What’s even the point. 
I have no idea what’s wrong with me but thoughts constantly randomly cross my brain about how I can off myself to make it seem like an accident to others. I have a great family and friends who care about me but I still feel alone all the time. I have amazing friends at home, but have been isolating myself from friends at college for no reason I can rlly explain. I want to be alone all the time but yet hate being lonely, idfk. 
I was the valedictorian of my highschool and am in college right now. Grades are awful in college bc all of a sudden I can’t get myself to give a shit. Can’t get myself to care about anything. In highschool, I used to perform at restaurants all the time (singing and playing guitar) and I absolutely loved it as music is my main passion; but now, I can barely get myself to touch a guitar,  much less get out of bed. Can’t focus on anything or have motivation to do anything. Brain just feels foggy. 
I thought that seeing a free counselor through my school might help me, so I made an appointment. She explicitly said that I’m bad at talking about my feelings (which Ik I am but still.. lolol) then signed my up for a permanent counselor with someone else. I never ended up going to the 2nd person bc I hate opening myself up to rando ppl and talking ab my feelings and  I wouldn’t even know what to say in the first place. 
Overall, idk what’s wrong with me or what to do with myself but it’s incapacitating."

1138,For those who dissociate...do you find that it’s hard to read when in a bad dissociative episode?,I dissociate often (depersonalization to be more specific) and when I’m having a really bad day I find it hard to read and sometimes can only read if I take my glasses off. I’m not sure why this is or if it’s just a me thing.
1139,My anxiety is killing all the fun in my life,"I can't get an erection with other girls . This is the second time it happened yesterday . This is the second girl . I was in a long term relationship with my ex girlfriend . We broke up but we still hang out and have sex sometimes . I am completely fine when im with her . Erection is normal and i last a good amount of time . I guess this is purely mental . I had this problem with my ex also but i talked to her frankly about it . She said it was okay and after that i was completely fine . Now that we broke up and i am seeing other girls , i cant get an erection at all . Even before I start making out , i have this fear that it will happen again . I need help"
1140,Alone, It's 7AM had a sleepless night. i'm 14 drinking cider. i'm feeling lonely and isolated from everyone else. i keep telling myself i don't matter. i want to kill myself. i can't trust anybody. i just want this pain and misery to stop i'm sick of suffering.
1141,i feel like objects are staring at me,This has been going on for a while. ive been trying to brush it off as things like maybe its just a phobia or im not getting enough sleep but now its starting to really get to me. ill feel like the handles on drawers are watching me or the wheels on my chair is its eyes and its looking at me or the flame of a candle is turning towards me when i move and it knows what im doing. i know none of this is real but its still really bothering me and i hate that feeling of being watched. any suggesyions or possible causea of this? maybe it is from lack of sleep?
1142,Too much stress...,Constantly worried about my father. I don't feel safe around him. I feel as if he's waiting to fuck with me. It pisses me off that he has this power over me. I have to find a way out...
1143,Manipulation and Drug Addiction,"I've been hooked on opiates since about 2012 after my boyfriend (now husband) beat me up and gave me a concussion.  I know, I know.  I lied about it and told everybody it was an accident.  I'm also extremely manipulative and use my small stature to get people, men in particular, to sympathize with me.  Sometimes going so far as to use my powers of manipulation to outright frame people with fabrications.  For the longest time I was just doing what came naturally, how my family taught me to behave.  Now that I'm getting older I'm starting to question my motives and my relationship with my husband.  I think I was just using him for financial support while I got my nursing degree.  I've wanted to leave him for awhile but he's starting to become very paranoid and lose his mind, getting a cache of all kinds of guns and weapons.  In part, he's scared that some of the people we framed in the past might try to do something to us.  He often participated in my endeavors, hacking and smearing people, etc.  But, it also seems to be a means for him to control me too.  He's always letting me know he's got guns.  I'm also worried about law enforcement.  My family has ties to extremists in another country.  Anyways, all these guns, dope, terrorism, etc. is starting to weigh on me and I'm just not sure what to do anymore.  I'm pretty sure I have a personality disorder, I'm just not sure what to call it.  Some people have called me a psychopath but I don't think that's right.  Maybe it's just because I'm a woman and women psychopaths operate differently?"
1144,Is something wrong with me?,"So, I've been wondering if I'm just very sensitive or mentally ill. Im 14 btw.
A week ago we watched a movie called ""they shall not grow old"" about the WW1. We know alot about wars and how many they were, when they were and so on. But It seemed kinda normal to me when I talked about them or told people about them.
But what I never realized is how terrifying they actually are. This movie really showed me reality. I never would've thought they would be that bad even though I knew so many people died under bad circumstances to say the least.
I feel bad for never realizing. So, now the important part. 
As the movie went on and the people actually started fighting, I was utterly terrified and shocked. All the noise together with the screaming made me tear up and I tried to hold it in because I didn't want to embarrass myself infront of my friends.
I was so shocked. Not even because of all the dead bodies, I mean they were really disgusting, but that wasn't what made me tear up.
I just felt so incredibly bad for the people that had to fight, I almost started crying like a baby. It felt so wrong and I had a weird feeling in my stomach. 
We had only 45 minutes to watch a part of the movie so we would watch 45 the next time. When the teacher closed the pc and we were packing our stuff for the next class I was still so in shock. But what made me question that It was ""normal"" for me to feel that way is that everyone was laughing again and playing it off. I just couldn't understand how you could possibly laugh after seeing something like that?
I thought to myself ""Am I the only one that was so shocked and almost had to cry?""
At home I told my sister about the movie and as I started explaining about the movie I started tearing up again and this time I cried for literal hours. I don't know what's wrong with me tbh.
The next part made me tear up again and then again. I was either very sensitive or just kinda ill because the other kids couldn't give less of a shit and the only thing they said was ""eww the dead bodies are so gross"" and started laughing.
I don't understand?!

TLDR: I cried hours over a WW1 movie and the other kids didn't give a shit."
1145,Has a toxic relationship ruined me forever?,"I was previously in a long relationship which I am realizing 2 years later was toxic and should’ve been ended much sooner than when it did. I’ve recently met this girl who Im head over heels for and we seem to really have a connection. She always wants to hold my hand and calls me cute etc... The problem is in my last relationship the girl seemed like she was trying to hide it, would slap my hand away and I don’t think I received a compliment the entire time we were dating and honestly it’s fucking me up mentally. Whenever I get called cute idk how to respond and idk what to say whenever I receive any sort of affection really. With the previous gf, I always initiated anything from hugs to kisses to more. For some reason I’m still in contact with the previous gf because she’s beat me down mentally to a point where I feel bad cutting her off but it might need to happen. She tried blaming her cheating on me and everything that didn’t work out was always my fault. I’m just feeling like this is going to happen over and over again and if I’m just better off alone.

TL;DR: Feel like I can’t start a new relationship because of my toxic ex"
1146,Like mother like daughter,"My beautiful 12 year old daughter has started having suicidal thoughts and harming herself. She has been jabbing a pen into her leg and giving herself massive bruises and sores. She gets bullied at school and on the bus because of her dental plates. I try to support her as much as possible but I don't handle this sort of thing very well, when I get stressed I tend to shut down. We've started seeing a therapist again, it helped her last time she was depressed until she didn't want to go anymore. I was hoping to never have to go through this with my children, she's just so beautiful, how do I support her through this? If anyone has been through something similar I would really appreciate some advice."
1147,How do I convince my friend to go to therapy,"My friends occasionally sounds seriously depressed - talking about how worthless she is, how people like her don't deserve to be happy"
1148,non suicidal suicide attempts? I know it doesn’t make sense,"sometimes I like to do risky shit just because. Last time I took over a gram of benadryl and it was a terrifying trip, but I somehow didn’t die? Still confused by that. People have died from less. Maybe I’m just super fat. 

I’ve been thinking about doing that again. Only a gram though and maybe half a bottle of vodka or however much I can get through. I mean I’m probably not going to actually do it because I am already paranoid and hallucinate without the benadryl. But I guess I like how scared I was. I won’t plan to do it, if I do it it will be spontaneous. I can’t really stop it *or* force myself to do it. Why tf am I like this???? I know I need to go back to a psychiatrist. It’s just complicated. I don’t need help I just... need help. Yeah. Complicated. Part of it is that I may just be normal and overreacting."
1149,Serious question,How to you know when its your turn to talk in a conversation.  I fuck it up constantly and it's really hurting my job.  Is there some sign that I'm missing?  I mean wtf if I keep spurting shit out at the same time as my boss causing him to look at me like an asshole I'm gonna have to find a new career.
1150,How do I convince my friend to go to therapy?,"My friend occasionally gets super depressed when talking to me on discord - saying how she's worthless, or how ""people like her don't deserve happiness"". She even revealed that shes done self hafm before, and almost attempted suicide, and its scary for me. 
I've talked to her about therapy multiple times but she always says she doesnt want to cause anyone trouble, and said she wouldn't go.
She had another ""episode"" I guess you could call it on the night im writing this, and I can't stand seeing her like this anymore. 
If anyone knows a way to convince her, it would be greatly appreciated. We are both in Canada if that helps"
1151,Signed off work. Dont know how to spend my time,"I've been signed off work for two weeks by a doctor because my deteriorating mental health is affecting my ability to perform at work.

1157,I feel like a failure and I might have ADHD,"Ok, I just want to vent about my life at the moment, It's not like its permanent. I probably won't write much but I'm in the hardest part of my life yet and venting is the only way I can make it through this. I'm a 15-year-old guy in High School. Throughout all of my early education, I was told I had trouble ""focusing"" and never listened to teachers. I missed a ton of school and my grandparents (guardians) took me to shrinks and just thought I was a spoiled rotten brat. I began having bouts of early anxiety attacks at ages 8 or even 7. I had thoughts about the fear of our existence is limited and nihilistic fears. I was able to go through my life but I'd have these horrible attacks where all I could think about is how we're going to die and nothing is worth it and how horrible it is I was punished by being put on the Earth. very intense stuff for a child. I would cry all night. They all went away though, no idea why. My life got better and better and I was doing increasingly good in school. In 6th grade, I was doing horrible with the new environment and could never do homework. I went to transfer to an online school and never ended up signing up so I was stuck in limbo without school. The next year I had to repeat 6th grade I did alright because there was barely any homework because I was placed in the ""dumb"" classes. I did so well in those classes I skipped 7th grade and went back on track to 8th and passed with soaring scores. I got into high school with college and AP classes with a 3.2 GPA right off the bat. I had a ton of homework. I still had the habit of missing school from all my life. It became a go-to thing. I started missing some school and the work overtook me. I had so much work to do and I was too scared to say anything to my teachers. Whenever I'd have the work in front of me I'd get distracted by hobbies. Hours and hours on YouTube and calls with friends. I just had fun and forgot about school. My school self and real self completely split. I noticed I was having more fun not focusing on the schoolwork that I just sat there and stressed on and never completed. I started prioritizing having fun and forgot about all my work. My grades are almost all F's. this is hitting me hard though, Everyone around me thinks I'm stupid. My grandma hates me for driving her nuts every morning arguing about going to school. The county is going to ban me from getting a driver's license until I'm 18 for missing school. I could even get arrested. At this rate, I'm going to drop out of high school. I don't want to work because I don't even know If I believe in having fun while working anymore. When I was a child I always thought I'd be able to go to Stanford and work at some super cool game company where I can work on cool games all day. Now that just seems out of reach. My stress is immeasurably large. I have assignments due today that I haven't done. It's so horrible seeing me be a letdown to everyone including myself. I feel like garbage and I feel dumb. I was always told I was incredibly gifted knowing several coding languages at only 8. I was always so smart but now I'm just looked down on. I tried getting into relationships but It seems nothing worked out there either. My grandpa has dementia too so I have to deal with him. He can be incredibly annoying and it almost seems like he purposefully annoys me. My grandma has had enough of him too and that brings the entire mood of the house down. She was very skeptical when I said I think I have ADHD. I just know it. I see how other people live and how easy it is for them to take out their binders or notebooks and start working. But here I am writing a Reddit post at 4:58 AM staying up all night when I have an assignment due at 7 AM. All of this has brought back those anxiety attacks from earlier. I now have these nihilistic out of body experiences every once and a while because of the stress. I've even started balding due to stress. Stress is just overtaking my life. Its all work work work money money money happy happy happy but I am not getting anything out of this. I'm struggling. I don't know what to do and I don't want suicide I just want to wish I were never put into this society and world. It honestly feels like I don't fit into this working class. I don't want to go to school because I see no point in it. It just brings my mind to my missed grades and assignments. Everyone around me with their cheeky smiles and wonderful grades complaining about C's is killing me. I have 20s and 10s as grades. I miss weeks on end. What would medication solve? Would It really help me focus on my work? Do I have depression because I've lost care for life? I honestly just might drop out of high school and run away to NYC and live out my dreams like Casey Neistat. be some unoriginal youtube guy. No idea what I'll do with my life and that's what scares me. These decisions shouldn't have to be made by a kid who was 13 and carried up until now. Is there even hope for my education? I just want answers to my life and if what I'm doing is truly going to end me up homeless and sad akin to how the world portrays. How do I handle my grandma? How do I make her love me even though I'm a failure?

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: failure to society and I haven't even been through high school 

Please help me through this"
1158,I cut myself and I can’t feel good about myself.,"I just started going to the gym in a effort to build a strong body, so then maybe I could feel good about myself for once in my life. But I’m still upset and I still can’t look at myself. It really hurts to be rejected too, especially when I’m “not tall enough” or I don’t have a “sports body” I’m 6 foot and I’m trying my best to build a body, but my stress eating has always been out of control. My video game addiction doesn’t really help either. I guess I’m just not meant to find love from  anyone or for to love myself."
1159,How do i talk about this with my therapist?,"In February last year I was diagnosed with adhd and cluttering as speech disorder.

I used to selfharm and have suicidal thoughts. But I've been clean for about a year now. Only recently I talked about it with my best friends and girlfriend who all suffer from depression and have selfharmed before.
The urge to selfharm has come back and I've started thinking about the thoughts I had back then. I don't know if that means the suicidal thoughts have come back or are coming back. 

I've been thinking about the plans I made on how I'd kill myself a lot recently. Not necessarily making plans, just remembering the thoughts I had back then. 

I also have lots of trouble with social situations.
I don't know if it's only because of my speech disorder or If it could be social anxiety.
I can't order in restaurants, make phone calls, talk to the cashier, etc. Without becoming extremely nervous, shaking hands or crying.
It's especially bad with things like talking in front of people. I will start shaking and sometimes I can barely breath.

I've decided to talk with my therapist about it. 
I'm afraid he won't take me seriously or that It is not really something important. 
Can anyone give me advice on how to talk about this with my therapist? 

I'm not asking for a diagnosis just advice!"

I want to get help. I have had a huge decline in my mental well-being over the past 2 years and it’s getting to the point now where i’m not going to university, because i’m physically too depressed to even get up and go. 
I really want to go to the doctors to see if they can help, but I don’t want my parents to find out. They aren’t the type of people who are supportive about that kind of thing, they’re old fashioned and would just tell me to ‘man up’ or whatever. 
My question is, if i go to the doctors to get help etc, would it be possible to hide everything from my parents? bear in mind, we live together still and they don’t give me a lot of privacy. I’m from the UK too."

If someone is trying to get close to me (not romantically)I would start having hundreds of thoughts like why are they coming close, am I wasting their time, do they sympathise with me, would they be happy with being a person like me, am I acting according to their expectations and what not...I just want this hell to end"

My headaches became very bad mid of last year to the point where I couldn’t walk properly at times 


I finally went for therapy and got meds around November last year 

Which lessened the headaches 

However since January it’s been coming back some days it can be quite intense , my meds dosage has increased since then , but today I swore I saw something ran past my apartment door.

I came home ,placed my things down turned back to face the door and this dark figure ran past my door


I looked out hoping I mistakenly saw my neighbour as a shadowy figure but there was nothing there 


I’ve been having a bad headache throughout the day and felt feverish (I took my temperature it’s normal) 

I’m kind of scared right now , should I call someone to tell them about what I saw? 


I have seen this “shadowy figure” once in my life before when I was around 12 

I exited the elevator at my apartment building and was walking along the corridor to my apartment door when suddenly I saw this black shadowy figure running down the stairs which frightened me causing me to run in a panic to my apartment entrance 



I sometimes fear that someone or something is hiding in my house (it’s irrational but sometimes I get scared to the point of locking myself in my room) I used to check every single room and closet/under the beds whenever I enter my house (I live with my parents and siblings but most of the time I’m home alone)

I am horrified at the idea of losing my self to this. Had a bad experience with an injected neuroleptic a year or so ago and its left me a bit worried about how drastic ""nuclear option"" stuff like ECT or ketamine treatment will effect me long term.

Since I was a child, it is difficult for me to sit still. I am constantly adjusting my clothes, which always feel wrinkled, so I am constantly moving and adjusting my posture and position.

This guy in the first 30 seconds of this video here seems to have the same problem as me, although admittedly more severe:

[https://youtu.be/zsi\_6zoS0ZE](https://youtu.be/zsi_6zoS0ZE)

Also, his problem might be drugs-related, but I take no drugs, even no alcohol. As I am growing older (I am 32) I am noticing that it is getting more serious. It is specially annoying when I ride a plane, go to the movies or just share my bed with someone, because people usually think I am being obnoxious with me just not sitting still. When I notice that others noticed, I get more self-conscious and I do it even more. It is also more serious when I am wearing formal clothes like a suit or something tighter. If I am at home in my pajamas I can sort of manage it.

I have never been able to sleep cuddling with a woman, because as soon as they place their head on my chest/shoulders I get incredibly uncomfortable and I feel the urge to move and adjust my position.

1179,How to fall out of love with the man I created. (Please help me)," 

Hi.. I need some help before this problem gets out of control, but this is very personal and maybe even a trigger for some people.

I don't remember much about my life growing up, but there are memories I don't think will ever leave me. I was molested by my own uncle when I was only 4, and I was raped at my ex-best friends house when I was 7 years old. I was in court for what felt like my entire childhood. Other sexual attempts were made that I remember bits and pieces of.. I just remember trying to survive through all of this and feeling so tired. I missed out on so much school from that and defending myself from bullies...I felt like the whole world was leaving me behind. I was depressed and suicidal by 10, but I never told anyone.

What saved me, is what I hate and love the most. Somewhere along the line, I created a man that I can't get over... when I think he's gone out of my head, he comes back, no matter what I do, no matter how happy I think I am, no matter how much I think I don't need him anymore, he comes back, for long periods of time until he disappears from me again. I've gone to lengths searching for anyone that could even remotely be him, and end up in a world of pain when I realize I will never find him in real life. So now... what once saved me is killing me. I have dreams, fantasies, a specific look. Black hair, blue eyes, a name, a voice, a style to match. I've fallen in love with someone who isn't real. A part of me doesn't want it to stop, but I know that I need it to.

I'm 23 years old now, and I've been in recovery for suicidal ideation for awhile. I've gone to professional help and have been diagnosed with many things, but I was told that this part of my situation is normal, that it's just a phase. But it is a phase that is hurting me deeply, almost to a point where it's dangerous.

I need advice, on how to get him to go away."
1180,Went to therapy for the first time!,"I saw a therapist today for the first time. It was somewhat awkward at first but when we got to talking it started to feel more natural. 

The problem is that when we started to talk about more heavy subjects I just locked up. I couldn’t talk because if I had talked I would have started crying my eyes out. I wanted to say things but at the same time my mind was thinking ”do not cry”. The therapist noticed and said that it was okay to cry in here and show your emotions. The only answers I could get out were ”I don’t know”, ”I can’t describe”, or just a sound of confirmation like mhm or yeah. 

How can I get myself to open up more? That is a place literally made for opening up but some how can’t do it."
1181,I haven't eaten for more than 2 days and I feel good about it.,My eating disorder like habits have returned and they're big this time. I crave to losing weight. I know that it's bad but my body just doesn't allow me to eat anymore.
1182,Why exactly is god belief not a delusion due to others sharing the same belief?,Does that mean that what we consider to be delusions is subject to change with common non-belief in god in the future?
1183,How to cope with negation of mental illnesses with stubborn people around you that believe and want to make you believe you're just imagining things?,"So, well, I've been in depression and anxiety treatment for almost three years now. It's been very long because I did quit the first try and the second was with a different doc. 

I used to be very skeptical about what my issue was. Indeed I did avoided drugs and put all my efforts on psychology and self care. It didn't work. I waited perhaps 5 years to visit my first psychiatrist. 
I've been thru maybe 5-6 antidepressants, several hypnotics, antipsychotics and anxiolytics. Failed a suicide attempt last year and really had a very awful depression and anxiety time. Every night very vivid nightmares, mania by days and feeling constantly like about to crash myself. 

Anyhow, as my question says, I'm just tired of people trying to persuade me everything is psychological alone. It's fine I think if they think I'm a ""weak"" mind or as many have told me ""you haven't tried hard enough"". I don't have to convince no one about what's my problem and why I chose this solution but it's getting really tedious to keep my comments for me and not explode to people with this type of unsolicited comments/opinions. 

I'm finally in the last part of my treatment. Might be out in maybe three or two more months. Feeling better but just worried how to react to this issue with people since well, I see them very often and most of the time they will try to start talking about that again. Thanks for your time replying."
1184,Food for thought. Be kind x,"When people are feeling anxious, sad, lonely, etc. it can often feel as if they are trapped in a dark tunnel with no idea of how to get to the end. Sometimes it can feel so dark that they don’t want to find their way out because the thought of facing that tunnel is terrifying, and it seems pointless even trying because they know they’ll just be wandering around aimlessly in the dark.

Now think of every kind word, every smile, every hug.. as a candle. That one flame may not be enough to get them through that tunnel, but it makes it a little less dark than before. Every positive gesture, no matter how big or small, makes that journey through the tunnel seem a bit more bearable, and the more candles that are lit, the brighter the tunnel becomes. 

Unfortunately it also works the other way around, and these days it seems far too ‘normal’ for people to blow each others candles out. I’m sure we have all been guilty of it, and it may not always be intentional, but every cruel word, every snigger, every rumour etc. can make someone’s tunnel even darker. We all really need to remember that actions have consequences and words can have a tragic impact. There is no way of knowing how many candles anybody has lit, and just one nasty comment could leave somebody feeling alone in the dark. 

Remember that you never truly know what someone is going through, you never know how dark their tunnel is and it costs absolutely nothing to be nice. It can be so simple to ignite a little flame inside of someone to try and ease some of their pain, and if you can’t manage that, at least make a conscious effort not to blow any candles out. 
If everybody stopped contributing to the darkness, it would make it a bit easier to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. 

So ‘In a world where you can be anything, be kind.’"
1185,I don’t look after myself,"I honestly don’t look after myself, I know it’s not good and I need to change that. I struggle with this a lot , I’m not sure why. I know I don’t love myself, I feel weird saying I love myself, every thought I have about myself is negative. I find myself switching from saying “you need to stop this negativity” but as soon as I say that in my head this other voice is stronger and always takes over, it says “no you don’t deserve to be looked after, what ever happens, happens just don’t care about your self and you will become numb. I seem to like not caring about myself. I don’t care if myself died tomorrow tbh. I’d only care about the fact that those who love me such as my boyfriend and brothers would not cope well for abit. I feel shit saying that actually but yeah I just I think I hate myself, I don’t like anything about me."
1186,Bitterness towards someone I like and not know how to express my emotions nor show love,"I have struggled with this most of my life without knowing why. 

Recently I have been dating this guy for almost two months and at the same time been going some personal issues where I have been quite depressed and negative for the longest I can remember. My mood has been at rock bottom for so long that each day brings some kind of misery and dissatisfaction 

I’m angry about how I’m acting and even more angry about how I project it onto others. I have been violent towards my cats and get very very angry when they do things they’re not suppose to do. Many times I’ll toss them away or hit them and the guilt that comes from seeing them run away in fear and look at me like “Why would you do that to us?” just frustrates me more. I love animals and my intent is never to hurt any of them but they at times are the outset for my anger and the depression I’ve been experiencing.

In order to cover up my feelings especially for a romantic relationship like the one I’m in, I make playful insults to them, am very sarcastic, and also play fight. Many times I’m not aware of how annoying this can be to someone or I have this compelling desire to do that with no ill intent. 

He told me this yesterday and it just made me cry because I feel like I’m just ruining what we have together because I repress my emotions so much. 

Getting lovey dovey with someone especially in public makes me uncomfortable but I want to do it. I was so of disgusted my kissing until I was doing it with someone I genuinely care about.

I feel like a terrible, bitter person and I don’t mean to be. But my head is not in a good space right now and I have no beings of letting it out.

I’m seeing a therapist so that suggestion is out. However I’m also going to be seeing a psychiatrist for the first time next Friday and I’m excited because I feel like only then I will get the answers I need. I just want someone to analyze me and dig into me because I’m tired of feeling like this for years and seeing it manifest in such a negative way and feeling like I’m getting nowhere. 

I almost killed myself two days ago because of all of this..."
1187,How do I better these tendencies?,"I realize that I am an escapist at my core. I am an adult, but a young adult in college that can’t get into bars. I do different activities like travel to different places when I don’t like how I feel(I usually blame it on the environment, but I really just think it’s me). I have sex to forget how I feel not really cause I enjoy it, smoke marijuana, drink alcohol, shop, overindulge, write screenplays and books of how I wish my life was like and just a lot of things to try to not deal with the way I’m feeling. I don’t want to keep doing this, but it’s so engraved deep into my core because I’ve been an escapist since childhood and now it’s affecting me directly. I want to be happy."
1188,I am actively starting to break down.. Hard,"I am starting to panic way worse than I normally do.  Most of my recent anxiety I cant identify the triggers.  I don't even know how to communicate what I feel.. Because in my head it sounds insane.  I feel broken and confused but like I'm in a dream at the same time? This last month I feel like I don't exist? Like. Not the alone way. But like my reality is fake?  I feel so out of control of even my own body. Its like a movie? Im not even sure and its a new feeling. I moved to a new state in the US last week so on top of this, im in a new and unfamiliar environment and now I'm crying and alone and i don't know what to do. Dont have a therapist yet and I really, really, want to avoid being hopsitalized

1191,I think I might have schizophrenia,"I know this is prolly the shittiest post y’all could have seen but I’m getting worried. 

To start, I’m sixteen, male and have a history of frequent weed use, meaning I have some decent points towards schizophrenia. I am very irritable, my memories are distorted, I keep hearing my name from voices I shouldn’t be able to hear (old family friends, dead people I knew, etc).

To explain the distorted memories, my family has pointed out several (I’m not exaggerating when I say tens to hundreds) holes in my memory, where I don’t remember entire conversations or in a few instances, the full day. 

Time also feels distorted for me, to the point that I didn’t even notice I had been working for six months (I thought it had been one month).

I’ve always had a rather...antisocial personality but it’s been worse recently. I was shocked to discover that people DONT try to actively manipulate the other side of a conversation, and it is in fact NOT normal to enjoy seeing others in distress.

Idk maybe I’m making something of nothing but all these things can’t be coincidences right??"
1192,"Im 24 years old, feel like im surrounded by insecure people that still act like they are in highschool","Background summery

before 2019:

So before 2019 I was overweight, had no confidence, didn't have luck maintaining friendships, felt defeated (felt like everyone was against me), bad mental health, etc. Basically I considered myself a textbook loser. My mental health just seemed to get worse the more I socialized and put myself out there. I was also a financial mess, working a minimum wage job to make debt payments so I can attend a school to get a degree that wont guarantee a job.  

After 2019: 

At the beginning of 2019, I stopped trying to maintain friendships, I started going to the gym, changed my perspective - stopped beating myself up, consider my own opinion of myself before I consider others, became more focused, more productive, have since quit university, etc. 

Present day 2020: 

So at this point, I have bettered my mental health immensely, I have a completely different perspective on life, I have lost 70-80 lbs and now im looking into a trade program that's free and leads to a paid placement. But even with this transformation, I feel like socially nothing as changed with other people. Its like I keep running into people who still think we are in hs and engage in this extremely cliquey behavior. Like if I don't check their boxes, I'm automatic trash, judgemental af, etc. I find this behavior extremely toxic and I personally don't think it reflects mature adulthood. What bothers me even more about these types of people is sometimes they are in a worse situation than you and me.... Like personally as an adult, I try to be social with all different types of people, I dont limit myself to a select group 🙄. So basically what I'm getting at here, is I bettered my situation by self improving my physical, mental health and personal finances without having to rely on girls or the social clique for moral support. But at what age do these people grow up? Seriously? I guess it goes with living in a small community. No word of a lie, I have had to work with this one girl who was over 40 but acted like she was a 16 year old. 

Conclusion: 

In my opinion, these types of people are best avoided if you are trying to better yourself and your mental health situation. As I've proven in my post, there is nothing wrong with me. Being my own leader has done more for my mental health than anti depressants. You don't need friends, friends need you. Be respectful and build someone up who you have an interest in and continue to engage if the feelings are mutual. Move on to the next person of theyre not. I have found this perspective has helped guide me towards the right kind of people, helping build friendships and intimate relationships. I hope this post helps people who are surrounded by negative forces improve their situation and help conquer the next day. You are what you want to be; if you want to be a winner then be a winner!

1194,Writing messes with my mood?,"Long story short, I have a ""book"" I have been writing on and off since 2012 on wattpad and in real life notepads. I dropped it for a couple years then picked it up after I got into a relationship with a girl who actually showed interest in it, so I moved it over to wattpad and wrote a lot more . We broke up in 2016 and ever since, whenever I write. As little as a chapter or just proofreading to fix the grammar of the old chapters: I get overwhelmed by a sad, gloomy and defeat feeling. It can be as bad as ending the day right there and going to sleep no matter the time or to even have a sleep paralysis episode. Which in and out of itself does give me great ideas to write stuff but I can't without it happening again obviouslly.   
I told this to a friend last night and he said I should drop writing but, it is something I have been writing for almost a decade! I know I don't have readers but I wanted to finish it to be able to say I finished a big project   
Should I listen to my friend?"
1195,i’m fooling myself,"i want to run away. cut my hair, dye it, change myself completely, looks wise. i don’t want anyone to recognise me. change my name, who i am, maybe that way i can erase all the mistakes i have made. i fool myself with the idea that i can just do that and not kill myself but the way i’m going i don’t think i can and one way or another i’m messing  up my family so what’s the point."
1196,Help.,"I’ve been mentally ill for a long time I’m 23 years old. I’ve had problems with diagnosed depression and anxiety/ panic disorder. I may have other undiagnosed things but I can’t figure out what. I’ve been told I may be bipolar or have some spectrum of schizophrenia. I’ve had especially bad problems with relationships and I’ve been in a ton of them. It’s very rare that my relationships last longer than a few months and I’ve never had one last longer than a year. When I’m single I can manage symptoms really easy but I’m very lonely and feel empty at times. When I get into a relationship at first I notice my symptoms are greatly reduced I even feel good. I know I love people to hard as I’ve been lonely my whole life and most people run away or abandon me and I have psychotic breaks and months of recovery afterwards. All that said, I’ve recently fallen for my coworker and we proceeded to have a relationship of sorts but not officially. She’s had a really fucked up life and also has a ton of mental disorders but she’s treated me better and has been more understanding than anyone else. One day she sat me down and said she wasn’t tossing me about but we had to back things off until she figured her self out. But we continued to talk all day every day and occasionally go out together. After that talk happened I became a mess and my symptoms have been overwhelming. Very recently I realized I just needed to leave her alone but that’s hard to do when we work together. I just acted very distant and she continually asked if I was okay. Later that day I found out my area manager was coming in and he is aware that me and her have something going on and we both got talked to about it before but denied everything. He came in that day and I left before anything could happen with me. He pulled a few people including my girl into the office and talked with them. I noticed she left me on delivered longer than usual and panicked and called her. She said everything was fine and they didn’t talk about anything that had to do with us. But she has not texted me back in almost 24 hours and never does this. I’m sitting here about to go into work not knowing what’s about to happen. My symptoms are extreme panic, nausea, shortness of breath ,extreme feelings of despair, suicidal thoughts, my body feels like it’s tingly numb and vibrating and it’s especially bad in both arms were they feel like there’s electricity. I keep seeing white noise in my vision it’s really hard to explain but it’s almost like I’m hallucinating. Everything feels so fucking intense and I just want to die."
1197,I just teared up from joy at work because the connections on a terminal where the way I thought...,"It wasn’t something that involved any other person or anything. Just that minor thing, felt extremely stressed, without any real pressure on me, throughout the whole day.

That’s it, now im going to take a few days off soon.

Just wanted to share, wish you all best of luck with whatever you’re up to."
1198,Feeling jealous in a weird way,"I have a hard time with the whole thing of coming out on top. Let me try to explain. This guy cheated on me 2 years ago, since then I've had an amazing boyfriend and wouldn't change what happened if it ended up with me being with this diferent amazing guy. But l went to check the other guy fb and saw that he went to africa to volunteer and then studied abroad and I thought wow and I'm here still in the same college where we met ect
Maybe it all comes from me being insecure and always thinking everyone else is cooler and is on a better path than me, but being him the one doing these kinds of stuff hits more because I think ""I'm the one who deserves to do the cool stuff cause I wasnt a bad person""
I don't like his personality for all the times he was stupid but I still think he has a pretty cool life and maybe I envy him.
How can I stop these thoughts? 


I'm also aware that we only see the highlights of someones life on social media. He's also 3 years older than me so maybe I still have a little time to do those things"
1199,"Heya, can anyone help me find articles for a school argumentative essay?","Hey, I'm in school and all,  and we have to make an argumentative essay on a topic. I chose to make my essay surrounded around how mental health and suicide, and how it's a serious issue. 

It being an argumentative essay, I'll need opposite points to argue about. I'm here to ask if anyone can link any articles that talk about mental health being a hoax or ""just in your head. "" that way I'll have sources to work with and argue against. Thanks again!"
1200,I don't think it's normal that tobacco has had a very positive impact on me.,"I have been using tobacco for about 4 years since I have turned 18, and I have noticed it improving my life in ways that I did not expect, however, I am thinking this is not normal and might have had some strange mental problems. 

So, one of the first things I noticed with tobacco is that it gave me a lot of motivation to do things I did not like doing. I was no longer super annoyed about having to do yard work or homework. Before tobacco, I was a much lazier person, but maybe that could also be attributed to me being less mature or more depressed (I will address that later).

I also noticed that tobacco made math much easier to learn. In high school, I was making D's in Algebra II, and I was ready to go into a job like graphic design that did not require much math. Once, I got to college where I could puffed on a cigar before class, I noticed I was better able to focus on paying attention, and started making A's. I kept going with math and now I'm in Calculus III, where I thought I'd never reach. 

Tobacco has mostly cured me of my depression. When I was in public school, possibly starting in elementary school, I got depressed. Most of my childhood sucked. It wasn't that I was abused or anything. It's just that I didn't expirience much overwhelming happiness by having a lot of friends. This occured up through high school, so I don't know if having a huge lack of dopamine really screwed me up. High school is where I got to my lowest point. In my senior year, when I starting using tobacco, I suddenly felt super comfortable talking to people and was able to think more clearly and have better abilities with social skills. 

Did tobacco just treat my depression, or did it treat some other mental problem I'm not aware of?"
1201,“You have to choose to be happy or miserable and sad. There is no point of you being miserable. You are blessed way beyond measure”.,"These are the words my girlfriend told me today. I suffer from depression for the past 5 years. Sometimes it gets better, sometimes I fall back to the well of depression and darkness . When I hear people saying these kind of things (“Others have it worse than you” and etc.) I feel terrible . If it all depended on me I would be happy but I can’t. I don’t even have the energy or motivation to get better anymore. I keep returning to the starting point. I feel like my feelings are not important and I’m an ungrateful selfish mistake of nature who should not have been born and is a burden to everyone around. I feel like I’m not allowed to be depressed but I am."

1203,"Need Help Getting A Copy Of My Psych Evaluation (M, 17)","Hey guys,

So a few years ago I had a psych evaluation and I cannot seem to find a way to get a copy. They had run through some stats of it with me and I remember only a little bit but they left a lot out from it. My parents had received a copy but refused to show it to me under the pretense that “ignorance is bliss”. 

Since I’m 17 I’m not sure how to get a copy of it so I can read through it. Currently I’m in a situation where I don’t have access to good psychologists or therapists and I’d like to be able to know so I can address the problems and help myself through some things, ie personal therapy. 

If anyone knows how I’d do it or has been able to get access to their own files please help out. If it matters I’m in Michigan and the tests were taken in Illinois 2-3 years ago."

1205,Started a blog,"Hello all, I started a blog for me to be able to get out all the garbage that goes on in my head. It’s pretty random and I just started it so not many posts. Just wanted to say that I’ll be writing a lot more on there and it’d be great to hear from anyone who might be feeling the same way as me or get advice from people who have been there. Anyways I just want to talk about my crazy brain ideas with a community of support! If you’d like to check it out it is:

1206,I feel like I’m in Groundhog Day,"Just a college student and kinda numb and not really sure what to even do with myself
I started a new job yesterday
I’m getting good grades
I’m living at home but I just wake up and want to go back to sleep and do nothing
Although I do have a history of depression this feels different."
1207,This is how my life has been for too many years now.. can anyone relate?,"I have done well for myself in life.. didn’t have much as a kid.. lost people i love.. got through a lot of hard times all whilst dealing with really bad mental health problems which i still have today and somehow i still managed to do very well for myself.. Turns out ALL the people i grew up with that know about my struggles and success, arent my real friends, they just want to try and make me suffer by playing games and telling lies about me to other people as much as they can.. All because they want to see me crumble and probably die as well.. The only people i see and have seen for years is my family.. i refuse to put myself around people that i know don’t really like me.. They pretend to like me and they think i don’t know that they really hate me.. I’m not being big headed but i think people are jealous of me because of how well ive done in life.. i just can’t take the hate.... i don’t know what I’m going to do for the rest of my life with no friends.. Absolutely sick to death of these people directing hate at me on social media every time i go online.. i feel like I’m trapped.. i should delete social media but if i delete it then they win but maybe it is for the best that i delete it anyway.. i have tried to make new friends a few times but some people just show you instantly that they don’t like you and for me that is really hard to take because it makes me think that something is wrong with me... Can anyone relate to this post or is this just how my life is? I really feel like its going to be me on my own for life.. Nobody likes me.. does anyone have any ideas on what i can do to change my life? Please share your story and outcome if its similar to mine"
1208,"I just had a full fledged panic attack in the middle of class, my two friends have been ghosting for about a week, and I can’t stop thinking about dying. I can’t get help.","I felt a panic attack coming on, started breathing really hard so I asked if I could leave and my teacher wouldn’t let me even though he already knew I had them. What do you know I have one in the middle of the class and have to get up and leave. I looked like a huge attention white because I really couldn’t breathe.

My two best friends have completely stopped talking to me and are going around trying to start shit with someone I am trying to become friends with. I don’t have anyone in real life that wants to be around me anymore because I’m going through mental health issues and no one wants to be friends with someone like that.

Anytime I get sad now, my brain is immediately like “just kill yourself”. I try to think happy thoughts but it’s just overwhelming. I try to go to the bathroom and calm down, but it usually ends up with me panicking or just feeling miserable. 

My parents won’t let me get help because they said I needed to figure it out in my own, but I’ve been diagnosed with GAD, ADHD, and Depression since 7th grade. I’m not allowed to take any meds. I’ve tried some over-the-counter shit and it just doesn’t make me feel any better.

My ADHD makes everyone think I’m a happy, bubbly person and I’m just not. I want to be. I’ve tried to fake it. I’m honestly just miserable. I want friends. I don’t know what to do."
1209,Help?,"Hi all, I was wondering if anyone could give me advice about how to get an appointment with someone to talk to about stuff? I’m not quite sure what I need but I know I need to talk to someone. 
I’m a teenager living in the UK so I was thinking maybe I could make an appointment to talk to a GP or something but I’m not quite sure how to go about it. 
Before you say the obvious, no I’m not going to ask me parents to help me. 
Any suggestions would be helpful, thanks :)"
1210,is it normal to hate your friends?,"I know my friends dont like me, my closest friend (used to be my best friend) and me aren't really close anymore because she's closer with her other friends than me. I don't have a best friend like most people do i feel like i cant get close to people because i feel like they're always closer to someone else than me.

My friends make plans without me and talk behind my back to each other i don't even think id consider them my friends anymore. anytime they make plans with me they fucking cancel i always get left out. like today we were supposed to go to the cinema together and i was really excited since i felt like maybe we were making progress but the most popular one out of our group cancelled so the rest of them did too, now im stuck with a non-refundable ticket by myself. they alway pull shit like this i feel like they dont want to be friends with me. who knows maybe im a shitty friend but i really try to make an effort for them just to get nothing back.

i hate the way they act so much, is this normal?"
1211,I hate my way of coping with problems.,"Besides from having my inner dialogue, I tend to make up conversations in my mind with the people I want/should talk to about my issues and problems. 

I play out the full interaction that I should make in real life in my head and after I ""played trough"" enough of the possible scenarios I just step down from
even attempted to seek out that conversation anymore. 

I had it, and my problems resolved (or maybe not), not the way intended but just so much that I don’t feel the urge to talk about them or seek help with it anymore.

Never really making that social bonding fucks me up, and so does  the fact that I don’t really solve my issues."
1212,FOR THOSE SEEKING HELP,"so i have to say i run a mental health channel on yt sub if u wanna-

jamies mental health talks
————————————-
But if your looking help please seek help from a councillor or from family/friends do not keep it to urself! Your amazing"
1213,Finally scheduled my first therapy appointment.,"Well, I finally did it after years of denying I needed it, and 6 months of putting it off. I dont know why I'm having such a hard time with it. I am just incredibly anxious and nervous about it. I have nothing against it, and have recommended it to many people, without them knowing I've never been. I'm just grateful my wife finally pushed the issue and did everything but call for me, only because she couldn't."
1214,How do I ask to see a therapist? Do I even need to?," ⚠️ TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ 


So if I’ve considered suicide, and self harm do I need to see a therapist? This seems obvious but I just need someone to tell me that I do because my brain hates me. I also have tried to make myself throw up. But the thing is, I think I’m getting better? When i want to kill myself, i can reason myself out of it by reminding myself of my friends who would bake themselves. And i have not self harmed in a week. But that’s mainly because I’m on vacation and literally cant cuz i don’t have my blade. I did try to make myself throw up last night, but i stopped after trying twice. Ugh writing this makes it sound so obvious but i would still appreciate a second opinion. Also, if I should see a therapist, how do I ask my parents? It’s gonna be super awkward. Any advice would be appreciated"
1215,Scared of going to a psychiatrist,"I've been depressed and anxious for years. Lately is gotten worse and I'm having problems functioning as a normal human being. I found a good and affordable psychiatric near where I live and really want to take an appointment but:

1) I won't tell anyone, neither my family since they believe is a shamefull thing and I'm really nervous they will eventually find out

2) I'm okay with taking meds but I’m also scared that I will be felling worse and won't be able to study for university (even if I’m already unable to do that) 

3) I have no idea what to tell my psychiatrist. I know I have depression and anxiety symptoms but I have no idea what is going on inside me. I'm really confused and I’m scared I won't explain myself well and they will misdiagnose me."
1216,"How do I (16F) go about telling my parents (47M, 42F) about my suicidal thoughts?","So for the past two-ish years I've been wanting more and more to die due to a variety of things in my life (school, stress, etc). It's gotten worse recently though, I'm less motivated which has started majorly affecting my grades (my last progress report had two Fs when I usually get As and Bs) and at night I often become tempted to cut myself.

I know I should get help, but talking about my feelings has always been stressful and uncomfortable for me.

Plus my mom is pretty emotionally abusive… Just this morning she called me and my sister p*ssies because we didn't talk back to her while she was yelling at us. And whenever I cry in front of her she'll hit me or in one case, call me a b*tch. (Which is where I'm pretty sure my discomfort about discussing my feelings comes from.) Even a few months ago she said to all of us that the only reason she doesn't beat me and my two sisters is because our dad is against that kind of parenting.

I know my dad will want to help me but I'm scared my mom will think I'm just attention seeking or being a crybaby (especially since I'll undoubtedly start crying while telling them).

tldr: I want to tell my parents about how I'm suicidal but I'm sure my mom won't understand and thus am afraid to.

Also sorry if this sounds too formal,,,"
1217,Cognitive Distortions,"I’m convinced this habitual way of thinking is/ruined my life so far. I think it essentially means most of us create a lot of our own problems. 

Examples:
Mind-reading,
Fortune telling,
Black and white thinking,
Catastrophizing,
People-rating,
Demandingness,
Discomfort intolerance.

Do you guys have experience with this and how do you fix/treat it?"

1219,My brain is always obsessing about something,"So at the minute I'm fine and happy and not obsessing about anything but in the past and probably again in the future, I will just have random obsessive thoughts in my head for ages that are intense, and then one day they'll stop for no reason, like my brain has got tired of the thought. The thoughts have got so bad that sometimes I think I have a mental health disorder.

Usually my brain focuses on one at a time. 

For example:
- I had thoughts daily that my boyfriend would leave me or fall out of love with me

- I used to overthink every social situation and be scared and overanalyse everything I said

- over analyse everything that someone else said and what It meant they thought about me

- time where I thought I couldn't trust any of my own thoughts

- scared that people in my family would die and I couldn't cope with them dying

- feeling guilty for happiness when others aren't or that I don't deserve it

- thinking intensely about others all the time

- felt guilty I was betraying my boyfriend even though I wasn't

My brain so quickly forgets about all these obsessive thoughts that it scares me."
1220,I think I need therapy,[deleted]
1221,"I'm a male with poor mental health, and society is suffocating me","I look in the mirror and down at my body and I see fat and misshapen rolls and skin flaps, I see a disgustingly ugly man with no good physical attributes. I get hit on, I have a girlfriend that loves me, I get compliments, but I still think I look disgusting. I have a serious self harm issue, I've tried to commit suicide 4 times, I struggle from diagnosed GAD and many other issues that I haven't gotten around to getting evaluated for due to my lack of motivation to do anything. And worst of all, I feel like everything that's wrong with me is entirely invalid. The trauma I experienced, the scars on my flesh, the horrid self-image I have of myself, all feel unimportant and irrelevant. I can't talk about things, I can't let the world know what demons I'm fighting with inside of my brain. That's not what men do, men are strong, men don't need help, men handle things on their own until their issues disappear or cripple them. ""Be a man."""
1222,Different person,"The love of my life has an undiagnosed mental illness that my therapist believes to be bpd. They jumped off their medication and have since left me, tried to get back together 4-5 times now and the last time made me believe their mind was changed and then by the night took it all back and completely stopped talking to me. They just started meds again but is still no where near stable. 
I’m aware the illness is at play but I’ve never been so personally manipulated and used for being loving and forgiving. I just don’t know how to let go or whether I should stand by until their meds kick in and I can properly communicate with them. 
It’s so incredibly hard to watch someone you love hurt you and themselves with no self awareness."

I have troubles socializing because of not feeling anything. I dont know when to smile or when to be sad. i just stand there and copy epression of others. Like a year ago i could just go cry and feel so much better but now , it just feels like i cant even feel sad. I just sit here at my computer trying to find anything that would make me feel anything. i tried everything that made me sscared or happy but it is just like im sitting here and not knowing what to thing. I would kill just for a little bit a sad feeling. I dont even think about suicide and it is make me mad.because i had depression suicide thoughts were daily but now it is just like i dont care, I Dont care if i live or die. I dont know if i am feeling anything or it is just my mind tricking me i dont know how to get myself out of this.But the worst thing is that i cannot tell anyone in real life. i just can´t bring myself to tell anyone.not even my psychiatrist.

1226,I need someone to tell me it's gets better even though I know it won't.,"It's been 10 months now. 10 months of hell. My anxiety and depression has risen to an unbearable level. I have tried with the different therapists and all of them were greedy and not helpful at all. None of the medicines have worked, even though they reduce the level of my anxiety attacks. I'm 16 years old and my illness is mainly related to my school stress. I am extremely anti social. Even my parents don't know what to do anymore. I was always good in studies and that was the only thing I liked about myself, I have no other hobbies or interests, I used to play sports and was in the soccer team but my knee got badly injured and I haven't been able to play ever since. I was very fat and I reduced my weight and became extremely fit but now again I have gained 16 kgs in the last 10 months. Nothing makes sense to me. I don't like anything. I have no will to live anymore. I don't know why I am ranting about stuff here when I know nobody cares. I cry every night. I keep on staring at the fan and think about dying."
1227,Hypomania or Normal/Good mood? Am I overthinking this?,"So I know this post would be more appropriate to post on the Bipolar subreddit, but it takes 30 takes to get approved and without approval your post is queued until a moderator can review it. I joined this subreddit a while back so I thought I’d post here.

Since I was around middle-school-aged I’ve been depressed or anxious or both the majority of the time. I’m in my early-20s now. Currently I’m diagnosed with 
Unspecified mood [affective] disorder, unspecified anxiety disorder, and ADHD predominately inattentive type. There are a lot of overlapping symptoms so I try to focus on treating my symptoms, and not focusing on a diagnosis. 

Over the past two or three weeks I’ve felt really good. Definitely one of the longest sustained periods of feeling good I’ve had in my life. It didn’t hit me until today that perhaps it could be hypomania. But it could always just be that I haven’t been depressed or anxious and what I’m feeling is just a normal mood.

I study psychology at university so I’m aware of the hypomania criteria, and I seem to be exhibiting some of the symptoms associated with hypomania rather strongly. Namely, decreased need for sleep and an increase in goal-oriented activity. 

My sleep has never been great, whether it’s sleeping too much or not sleeping enough, but the past few weeks I haven’t been sleeping a lot at all and I don’t feel like I need it. I’ve pulled all-nighters and felt great the following day. 

I’ve always had an interest in filmmaking and stand-up comedy, but the past few weeks I’ve been doing extensive research on the craft and execution of filmmaking, to the point of the working on multiple screenplays. It’s like I can’t get enough information on the subject. As for stand-up, I’ve been writing jokes consistently for the first time in a long time, and it seems like everything I write is golden. I really just feel like I have one good idea after another, and I stay up late writing because when I lay my head on my pillow I keep thinking of ideas. I feel like for the first time I’m pursuing my goals in a meaningful way, after desperately wanting to for years, and floundering time after time. 

Also, I’m usually a really quiet person. Even if I have something that I feel can contribute to a discussion in class substantially, I don’t speak up. If there’s a person that I think looks interesting and I’d like to initiate a conversation, I find any reason to pass up the opportunity. But lately I’ve been a lot more engaged in my classes and different social settings. Answering questions, cracking jokes, initiating conversations. 

I haven’t worked in over a year. I’ve learned going to school full-time and working is too much for me to handle. I become an anxious mess and rescind into a child-like state of dependency. But in the past week alone, I’ve applied to a half a dozen jobs.

So what’re y’all’s thoughts? Is this what it feels like to not be depressed, or am I experiencing hypomania and it’s just a matter of time before I crash?

I understand y’all aren’t medical professionals. I just want to know if you have any experience distinguishing between hypomania and a good/normal mood. I see a therapist weekly and I see my psychiatrist rather frequently as well. However, I just saw my therapist yesterday and I didn’t make the connection until this morning.

I should also mention that I’m medicated. I take Celexa and Lamictal. I understand Lamictal is a common treatment for Bipolar II, and it’s also been shown to be effective in treating treatment-resistant depression. That being said, I’m not too worried about my symptoms progressing to full mania, I’d just like to have some guidance on how vigilant I should be."
1228,"Given up on myself, need help","Hi guys new member here usually lurking and not posting tbh! Where to start hmm I'm a 22 year old male who has suffered from depression ever since I graduated from high school.

I've basically experimented with every drug except heroin and crack I've done drugs cut with meth a couple times. At this moment in time I do adderall regularly and smoke weed maybe 2. Or 3 times a week. In the summer of 2015 I took acid by myself and hung out with my friend then made the stupid decision to drive somewhere. On the road I started freaking out and eventually the cops were called. I then had a massive seizure and apparently It took 8 people to restrain me I was on life support and in the hospital for two weeks. I was on lithium at the time and did not do my research. I took a year off after graduating hs. Fast forward a year I'm in school at DePaul in Chicago I decided to trip CID again at a concert. Thinking I was safe cause I had not been on lithium for like 6 months at that point the same dam thing happened. At the end of the semester I needed to come home because I was suicidal at that point. A broken heart, 2 weeks in the hospital and getting jumped and stabbed in the head all within that short semester took a toll on me. Those experiences fucked me up and continue to fuck me up. For the past few years I've been in and out of the local community college here in Pittsburgh. I can never just the do work. I developed a gambling problem like 5 months ago and went to rehab for it( technically it was for weed). I got out of rehab like 2 months ago and I had an incredibly hard time readjusting. I'm still madly in love with my ex who I haven't dated In two years, we talk occasionally (mainly when her and her bf are having problems) I hate that I still love her. I hate that i still think about her constantly. I've been with several women since trying to fill the void she left in me and nothing has worked. I know though that even if we got back together it wouldn't be the same. Yet I still lament on the times we were together, it's pretty fucking sad. I sleep alot to cope. I'm not working rn as well. I have no motivation at all to find a job. I have no hope for myself whatsoever. I've given up on taking care of myself. I'm not living life at this point I'm merely existing. Life doesn't seem real at this point. I go through the motions but I'm not really experiencing life whatsoever. Please guys give me some advice. I'm seeing my shrink today, hopefully he can help me out. I just want to be happy and live a productive and fulfilling life. The only thing holding me back from taking my life right now is the strain it would put on my family who I love very much even though I don't show it. Thanks if you read this whole thing and take the time to respond."
1229,Mid Life Crisis (and I’m only 18),"
I’ve just turned 18 (birthday was yesterday) I’m female and I was made homeless when I was 17. I spent a few weeks in homeless sheltered accommodation but was given a flat quicker than most due to mental health circumstances and letters from my psychologist. I suffer with severe social anxiety and borderline personality disorder so have days where I feel alright but equally, days where I completely crash and hit an all time low. I’ve made my flat feel homely, but I can’t stand my life. It’s one massive routine. Wake up. Feed my cat. Go to college. Come home. I recently adopted a homeless cat to make myself feel better, and although I look after it I can’t feel love towards it because I find my life so boring. I do meet friends and socialise but I never enjoy it. I feel like a middle aged woman and I’ve literally only just turned 18. Im really suicidal and don’t know how much longer I can keep this going. I’m about to crack. The only thing I take pride in is how I look but recently I’ve been letting that slip and am starting to get into debt and I’m only fucking 18. 

This is life. Starting off with a poor family, having an unfair disadvantage in life, and I’ll be growing up to have a mediocre job after graduating college and looking after cats lmaoo. How exiting"
1230,How to thrive with bipolar disorder,"1. Become vegetarian/vegan
2. Drink non caffeinated tea
3. Intermittent fast
4. Study/ Practice neuroplasticity
5. Run 4 miles everyday after work to help you sleep
6. Study the esoteric, science, and philosophy(stoicism preferably) to know your true power
7. Believe that God made you like this for a specific reason
8. Be mindful of the media you consume. Negative energy could be transmuted to your mind/soul.

That is all."
1231,i feel like my psychiatrist isn't taking me seriously,like sometimes i wonder if she cares at all. i've been taking meds for years and been seeing this one psychiatrist since a year and we changed hella drugs and i'm still not feeling good. like WTF. she's supposed to be the best doctor in the city.
1232,I don't know whether my feeling of uneasiness comes from my mental or physical state,"Hello ! I've been feeling light headed all day and was having a very strong heart ache (to the point if feeling like tearing up but notbeing able too), also i felt unable to focud.
 Im quite young (20m) and don't smoke nor drink.
I've had a lot of small issues pilling up and my friends tell me to be a little more carefree andless of a overthinking/paranoid person over this.

Those symptoms fluctuate through the day and i wish i could know whether it is just a chemical inbalance.
Thank you for the read and im open to any advices"
1233,How am I ever gonna be a human?,"My parents went on vacation today. I'm home alone. I could finally make music all day and have my friends over.
But I'm just numb and broken. I have no energy. Now that noone sees what I do all day I just don't do anything. I can't bring myself to.
I had to go to work and I did but the drive there and the drive back killed me. I literally had a breakdown over parking my car. I feel like this is going to kill me. 
I'm cancelling everything that I need a car for this weekend. I can't handle it. But how am I ever gonna be a human when I can't even handle driving? I can't do this anymore."
1234,My brother has schizophrenia,He is flipping out and says he wants to go back in time and make my mom shoot herself in the back of the head. He needs treatment or he will kill someone. He doesn’t want treatment but he NEEDS it and he doesn’t live with us. What should we do? How do we get him on his meds again or in a hospital?
1235,[Discussion] Questioning wanting to work in mental health field?,"Hi there, I hope this is the appropriate subreddit to discuss this in. I'm (22 y/o) a front office admin at a mental health center in the US and love my job, love who i work with, but sometimes realize it's an exhausting field. In high school I wanted to do artsy things, then thought psychology was more practical, and even considered the art therapy field. I graduated w my bachelor's recently in psychology but have no desire to go to grad school quite yet. I have a terrible mindset where I feel like I'm letting clients down, therapists down bc such high demand for services and we are a small business and can only provide so much. By the time I get home it's rare I want to do anything besides lay down and let my brain turn off/ watch TV. I'm second guessing my choices. When looking for higher paying jobs in related fields that don't require a masters, it's been hard bc I feel like no matter what, I'm gonna be stuck with something I don't like. I start paying student loans soon and know my current salary will eventually be too low if I wanna move out of my parents. I don't know what I'm looking for with this post, maybe words of wisdom or opinions? Is it foolish for me to start pursuing artistic stuff now also? Lol oi vey"
1236,Help,"Please Help, i do not know what to so anymore, i am so tired. About 2 years ago i was so sick, i had stomachache all day long,i could not work anymore, i just lied in my bed all day. I went to the doctor and too many doctors, test and exams before i just knew...i had nothing, i was healthy. So i went to the psychiatrist and did therapy. Nothing happend and i quit. Some months later i was better but without work. Time goes and i did better but never how i was before i got sick. In december a person (my sister in law) do a thing that make me go in the same state, pain all day long but now is diferent and when the pain goes to me i hate and think in vengeance and revenge, i think horrible things and i can not stop, i am suffering too much, i am staring to hate my boyfriend, i hate everyone and i hope the person who did wrong to me, suffer like me. I am full of hate and i am tired, i can stop please help me, i am tired of this life, is like hell."
1237,I just failed an exam that I know all the content for.,"Please just tell me it's okay... I'm done. I'm finally going to register with Student Disability Services. I can't do this anymore. All I want is my education, so I can save everyone trapped by themselves. I have to accept that I too, am trapped... I have to ask for help... After almost a dozen revolving diagnosis, and over half my life in therapy... I still. Need. Help. I have to accept this, no matter how painful it is.

I may never truly be okay, and maybe this is permanent, maybe coping is life... None of this means I have to give up."
1238,I can’t take it anymore,"I’m having one of those surreal nights again. I don’t know how many of you know the type, when you just want to feel something, so all your physical senses are dialled to 11, because mentally/emotionally you are completely numb. I can see things in a whole different way that I can’t explain, and feeling textures and temperatures is far more prominent. I want to cry, I want to sob until there’s no water left in my body, but I can’t. I know the whole “I’m alive but not living” saying is cliché, but it’s terrifying when you realise to what degree it reigns true in your own life. I walk this planet each day, perform different activities, interact with friends and family, go to school, but it’s not for myself anymore. It’s not because I want to or have the will power or energy to. It’s just because I have to.

I’m alive, because I have to be. That’s all I have to say for myself.

I would say “I’m nearly 16, I should be out spending lots of time with my friends savouring it while I can having the time of my life” but it shouldn’t matter what age you are. No one should just be living because they *have* to, it’s torture. They should be living because they enjoy it and they *want* to.

I’ve been on this planet for 1 and a 1/2 decades; lots of people my age enjoy being here - but all I have left to show for myself is insomnia, a constant state of depression, these nights of sensory overload, and when I’m lucky, the odd glimmer of joy. Like, I had a surgery today, and though I was crying through the pain of the anaesthetic needle going into my foot, I couldn’t help but be relieved that I was feeling something real. I don’t want to live my life like this anymore, but no matter what I do I can’t seem to fix it."

1240,Overcoming irritation/anger with the people you love,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but here goes: I was wondering if anybody had a tendency to get irrationally irritated with people (often those they spend most time with) to the point that one feels anger towards them? I'm an introvert and have found this often occurs when somebody spoils my alone time. 

I'm becoming cognizant of how unhealthy it is, from both mine and the person-I'm-irritated-by's perspective and its something I'd like to work on. 

Quick example: I'm reading my book on the sofa in the evening when my housemate - and best friend - comes home from work. He's always cheery to be home and asks me about my day, etc. but there are certain days when I will be tremendously short and rude and probably mean to him in response.

Does this happen to anybody else? Is there a way I can stop feeling like this? I hate feeling that way towards, often, the people I love most and I think it makes me a bad person. Any help or wisdom much appreciated."
1241,I have to ask this: (A little long SORRY!),"Does anyone else here have any experience (directly or indirectly) with Impulse Control Disorder? I feel so uneasy here because 99.999% of the posts are Depression ... Anxiety ... Suicidal (I can at least relate to this one) ... Other things that I have no answers or comfort for the person, beyond the superficial ""I'm so sorry..."" because I can't relate in the slightest.

This really fucking sucks because I am getting discouraged and (keeping it 💯) and angry because I just don't feel...completely heard? I feel like people don't really relate to what I'm going through, though it is VERY similar to what a person who is withdrawing from drugs or alcohol goes through, but without some of those physical symptoms like nausea and extreme shaking, etc. I get horribly anxious, as I've described already in other posts, and fidgety, and quite bitchy when I can't set a fire. I did set a small and controlled fire today at the bus stop (the bus took forever to come today...gotta love public transit!), which was just a piece of tissue that I had in my pocket. There was another guy at the bus stop with me but I couldn't hold it in...I had to relieve the pressure and angst or I would have literally screamed, then thrown myself in front of a car (that would have been great a couple days ago when I WANTED to die, but for now that feeling has dulled a bit)...I couldn't stop myself. I cried as I did it (inside not outwardly) because again I was helpless to control my Animal, who has been absolutely out of control since I was released from prison. She was not too bad at first, but she has gotten stronger and wilder, especially in the past week. I can't control her. I already told my Mental Health Case Manager and she wants me to call my Probation Officer, who has a strong Mental Health education (a Masters Degree in Psychology), and let her know that I am out of control so IF something happens, she would already be informed. Ugh my Case Manager thinks I'm going to go off the rails (she was just speaking honestly) and it takes every bit of my self-control (funny, that is the song I am listening to--""Self Control"" by Laura Branigan) to keep myself from torching another Dumpster, or worse, a house.

This is long enough. Just needed to get my thoughts out. I am not suicidal as much now, as I'd said already, but I am anxious to the point of a panic attack and frustrated and angry. All it will take to send me into a panic attack is a loud noise or someone walking too close to me. Ugh. Has anyone ever experienced that?

So... Is anyone here like me and can't control their impulses or know someone like me!?

My ""therapist"" (I have her as a contact if I need to talk) just asked me why I'm not talking to her anymore. 🥺 Yeah, that wasn't awkward at all. Then she said, ""Struggling, huh?"" and I was thinking ""Wow--great observation Captain Obvious..."" but I can't tell her just how much I am struggling. It is like I'm fighting for my sanity, and my life.

Help me...sigh."
1242,Is there a saying or quote that really helped you through a tough time or changed your mindset?,
1243,I can't talk to people in close to and over share with literal acquaintances. 17f,"I over talk sometimes. I have issues with anxiety and stage phobia. It's affecting my academic performance and making me depressed. I also feel embarrassed very easily. I have nightmares of someone tricking me into sexual acts. Many times I'm a pre teen or younger. I was molested by my bus driver for months so that could be it.


I don't have friends I feel comfortable being totally honest with I guess. I have amazing friends. They're supportive and fun. Very non judgemental. But this is my last year of high school and I guess I'm aware that we're going to drift apart. So I just don't bother opening up.


I haven't even come out as bisexual although I have a feeling they already know. I've provided them with emotional support. *I just can't get over this fear*. I can't talk to my parents either. I just don't feel like it's necessary to involve them. I'm also scared of their overreaction.



Bottling up all this for years has had side effects besides depressing episodes. I'm good at writing speeches and all. I haven't delivered one in 7 years. It didn't effect me much till I was 10-11. That's when my breast was groped while I was going to my tutor's. I remember never walking through that alley again. I was in shock, never told anyone. Just went and studied like I was in a zone. When I was walking back home, I almost got myself run over. Still have a scar on my thigh where some metal stabbed my leg.



 
I just couldn't tell. Don't know why. That's when I realized what that driver had done when I was 5. I became pretty much suicidal. I remember writing up a plan: I'll finish this school year with good grades, I'll stop getting into fights, loose weight, I'll jump off my building on my 12th birthday.



Guess I never did that but as I said, I have an overtalking problem. Just don't talk to people in close to. So I told a bunch of neighbors. Neighbors told my father. My father was furious. I never followed the plan. Kept postponing. I remember even going to rooftop on my 13th. Somehow didn't do it.



It slowly left me like some phase. I felt really better when I befriended my now best friends. I got an interest in politics. Intellectual debates and watching cricket were my favourite pass times.



I've been feeling very depressed last few months. So sad and can't study for my life. It was one of the things that helped me with depression. It's one of the signs that I'm very much more depressed than usual. I want to study. I need to. I have exams from Monday. The results will decide my future. One that I haven't been able to force myself to care bout.



This is too long sorry. I can't see a therapist.

I'm 17f"
1244,Typically how long is treatment for body dysmorphia?,I finally found a therapist and my insurance is covering it!!! I just have to pay $20 each session as a co-pay. This is kind of a lot to me as a college student without a job. My boyfriend thinks that it should only take me 5-6 sessions.
1245,Stress/Anxiety Questionnaire,"Hey guys, this is just a follow-up questionnaire on some data gaps that I'm having for my school project on a mental health app. It would be very helpful if you could just take 2 minutes to answer a few questions based on coping mechanisms with stress and/or anxiety and your environment.

1246,Struggling when I'm alone,"From the summer of 2017 to the summer of 2018 was a really bad year for me. I was depressed, had a lot of social anxiety, and spent a lot of time alone. It got better after the summer of 2018 and it's only gotten better with time! 

Now I go to a school where I live at, which means I'm with people all the time. I have a girlfriend, loads of really good friends and I get along with everyone! I would say I'm doing really good and I'm confident. When I first get to spend time alone, I usually feel fine. But I notice in the vacation, where I spend more time alone, if some days pass, I get back to bad thinking habits that I had before. I guess my brain and body hasn't normalized feeling good when I'm alone. Has anyone else noticed the same as me? And what did you do to get better? Thanks!"
1247,Hello fellow warriors!,Can someone (a mod) please tell me why my post about my Instagram supporting mental health keeps getting taken down? Am I doing something wrong? Thanks!
1248,I had a thought,"I recently found myself feeling the worst I think I ever have. And realised that there’s a possibility that I could feel this bad, or possibly even worse in years to come. But before then, I’m going to have times where I feel better. And that’s what I and people I know look forward to experiencing and experiencing with me. All emotions are temporary but they are worth it because without despair you wouldn’t feel true joy in those moments where everything feels ok."

1250,What am I going through? Is there a name for this?,"Hi guys,

I was diagnosed with bipolar a few years back, and things are usually fine.   
However, I still experience these ""episodes"" or ""meltdowns"" from time to time, but I have no idea what it is, or what it is called. I don't think it's an anxiety attack, but more like a depression attack? This is what happens to me:

\- Severely depressed very suddenly  
\- Hyper-ventilating  
\- Crying so hard that I'm unable to speak   
\- Wanting to die/hurt myself etc.  
\- Collapsing on the floor, bawling. 

It's like what you see in movies when people see a loved one die. It's brutal, and it is emotionally extremely painful. 

It literally feels like someone just told me that my boyfriend is dead. It is intense and I can't see any way out other than actually dying. I want to scream and die.  Then after a while, my body gets exhausted and I usually cry myself to sleep. 

Is there a name for having an episode like this?"
1251,I don't know what to do,"I don't know what to do. I don't have any motivation to do anything. I don't enjoy even the things I use to like. I have a hard time getting out of bed. I also have a hard time getting to sleep. I feel mentally numb. I've considered suicide as a means of escape once or twice over the past couple months. I don't know who to talk to or what to do. I told my parents and they asked if it was ""electronics"" fault (they're Boomers). They also asked if I wanted to speak to the pastor, while I am a Christian and believe all that is real I just don't know if that would help. I've been going through the motions for a while now and don't think I can hold on much longer. I'm tired of living without feeling."
1252,Personality Disorder Ruining my Career,"I’ve always had trouble at work. I’m a teacher and I’ve never really had the confidence that I was any good at my job despite test scores and evaluations. I seem to ruin every job I’ve had by complaining to coworkers who then go and tell administration. I recently was transferred to a new school position after my old principal discriminated against me on recording. He insisted it was because he was tired of my negativity so I ended up with a directive not to spread negativity. I have borderline personality disorder, pervasive depression and anxiety. I was told my disorder didn’t matter, that they weren’t expected to make any sort of accommodation that would help me in venting my frustrations or with emotional outbursts. There are several ADA accommodations I do have that have been ignored. I’m supposed to have a duty-free 30 minute lunch and they do not give me one on Friday I have back to back classes. I recently confided some colleagues about my frustrations with not getting a lunch, the large class sizes of 45 to 50 kids, a teacher’s complaint that I was having a hard time with the large class sizes and behavior management, and the fact I found out I was being transferred again at the end of the year and never had a chance to earn my spot at this new school. I shouldn’t have vented to them. I barely know them, part of my disorder makes me think friendships are closer than they are. I was called in by my principal and accused of calling a teacher a bitch several times by many people and accused of pushing a colleague when they didn’t agree with me. I absolutely did not push anyone and I never swear at school. He said that people overheard because my office is in an open area. He said he couldn’t prove it it happened but that from talking to me he didn’t believe it didn’t. He had also pulled up the directive from HR that had all of the allegations from my old principal on it so he had pretty much made up his mind against me before even talking to me I think. He wanted to place me on leave but I think HR told him to let me finish the year. He told me if I was found to have been negative or retaliate against anyone he would immediately fire me. I kind of just want to isolate myself because I do have emotional outbursts, I cry when I’m upset, uncontrollably. I’m on medicine and going to therapy but it’s a long process. My worry is that it will be seen as retaliating if I’m not social with people. What do I  do?"
1253,How do I cope with borderline personality disorder?,"I took the decision to seek help today, so I have to wait a few days now so I can talk to a professional. With that being said, I'm pretty sure I've been suffering from BPD. I match pretty much *all* the criteria.

I'm having a hard time coping with my significant other being away. She's busy, and we don't really have anything much going on so far...just dating. But I feel really attached to her, nonetheless, and her absence makes me think of so many horrible things...during my dissociative moments, I've even had violent fantasies (which I know I could never act on; I have a hard time hurting people or even animals even in self-defense, let alone out of anger - something I've never been able to do). I feel bad after having these fantasies and I always go back to imagining the perfect world with her. This can be a difficult, time consuming task...as I have to imagine a perfect, but *believable* world. I can't just lay down in bed imagining some unrealistic dialogue. It needs to feel real, and this often leads me to feeling worse.

I was wondering if anybody on here knows any advice that has worked for people with BPD (or whatever what I just described might be. Does it sound like anything with a name to anyone here? Not looking for a diagnosis here, just looking for things that might help me in my conversation with a psychologist.) I need a way to cope with this, because it's making me feel miserable. This clouds my mind 24/7. I've even had a nightmare the other night. It's not like she doesn't give me good reasons to believe she likes me, but my mind requires proof like every 5 minutes.

Any advice is greatly appreciated."
1254,Feeling dejected. What should I do?,"As the title says, I feel dejected. Not sad, just demotivated and less productive. Takes more time to study and more energy to focus. 
Have been taking the same antidepressant for about 4 months which (was) helpful until the last two weeks."
1255,Why do I torture myself emotionally?,I also cut sometimes.
1256,I’ve been depressed for ages and I don’t see it getting better. Life is just the same everyday: wake up and do nothing all day long.,"I have absolutely no willpower whatsoever to do anything. Life feels pointless. There is so much wrong and I can’t talk to anyone or be understood or anything. I have suffered in silence for years and I’m 18. I’ve been very close to suicide and have had frequent occasions where I cry myself to sleep. I think about different suicide methods every single day. My life is such a disaster compared to most other people my age. I have none of those teen experiences that you hear about like partying, getting drunk, etc. or just going out with mates in general. Certainly no mingling with the opposite sex. 

If I struggle with doing even the most simplest everyday things then I have no idea how I will get better by improving myself to the point where I am content. It’s impossible."
1257,I want to hurt myself,"\*Trigger Warning\*

This is purely a cry for help and validation. I am in a more calm state right this second. Reading through the posts and commenting on this thread helped. I have been having intrusive self harm thoughts more frequently as of the last few weeks. I want to stab my forearm and bash my head into something. 2 days ago I was literally thinking that suicide might be a better alternative than showing up to work the next day. At 30 years old I am finally recognizing and accepting I may have depression or some real MI. I made a doctors appointment to evaluate. I have had a hard time accepting it because it feels like every time I try to express to someone that I feel depressed, they brush me off with ""well everyone is depressed"" or give me an attitude that makes me feel like I am playing victim. That usually makes is so much worse and I feel like, ""Who am I to have the right to feel these feelings when others have it so much worse?"" I've had panic attacks that started in junior high. I believe I have a hard time expressing myself because when I was growing up, I was always the one who was ""put together"" when everyone else was falling apart. I felt pressure to keep up that facade when I was with my family. I have always prided myself on being a strong motivated person. It's weird because I can objectively tell myself that I am a badass, but then also have that voice that says, ""you're such a piece of shit hypocrite."" I also read something that was helpful on here just a few minutes ago, [https://www.dazeddigital.com](https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/31195/1/what-life-is-like-when-you-don-t-feel-real) I have often felt this feeling, but didn't know there was a word for it specifically. 

Anyway, I'm posting here for the anonymity and shit."
1258,A poem I wrote about my depressive episodes.,"It ebbs and it flows, from my head, to my toes.

Like a stormy sea, it washes over me.
Overcome once more, I fall to the floor. 

For all to see, I am unhappy. 
I'm sorry, I've been here before.

I'm tired and scared, I pretend I don't care.
I'm tired and scared, I care, I care.

It ebbs and it flows, much like these words. 

I'm sure you'll agree, it ain't got nothing on me.

It's ebbs and it flows I know for sure, I'll stand again and be stronger, my friend.

1259,Frustrated and deeply depressed.,"⚠️Trigger warning for suicidal ideation and self harm⚠️The last week has been hell for me. I have been very depressed for a while but I hit a low I haven't felt in a couple of years. I'm very suicidal and have been self harming daily which is something I haven't done in several years.
  I've reached out to a friend and my mom last week after almost attempting twice. My mom doesn't know I've attempted or that I have been self harming but my friend does cause she's been the one I've called. I came to the conclusion that I need to get help by getting back on meds and checking myself into a hospital because I don't feel safe. Every day has been a struggle for me and I haven't felt genuine happiness or a will to live. i really don't want to go to inpatient at this point but I know I need to be in a place where I can be safe. I have to spend a majority of the day sleeping or pacing around and getting rid of things I can use to kill myself so I don't but I'm getting so sick of that.  I don't have health insurance but my county has a program where you can be provided services like meds, therapy and hospitalization with little to no cost. I'm an adult but, I'm currently unemployed and unable to drive. So, I'm relying on my mom to get me there because I live in a rural area. It just seems like she doesn't care because I told her last week and I'm still sitting here losing it and it's frustrating and it only makes me feel shittier. I'm trying to hold on but it feels like I'm on the verge of breaking. I'm just upset at the moment because I wish I hadn't told anyone and that I'd already be dead because it seems like no one cares. I just needed to yell about this"
1260,"Anxiety &amp; depression, does it ever go away?","Hi all, I (24F) started going to therapy last year around August to finally talk to someone about all that I feel and why. Since I was a teenager I kinda had an inkling that something was wrong with me. Well long story short I was diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression. Now almost 8 months later I feel good, but I never actually feel “great.” I have just as many good days as I have bad ones. So I’m wondering for those of you who have been treated for years, does it ever really go away or is it just a matter of managing it? Sorry if this is a silly question, but this is all still new to me mainly because of the fact that my family doesn’t believe in either so after years of suppressing I’m learning more about it everyday. 
Also, do you guys take medication? Why or why not? 
Thank you &lt;3"
1261,Who was/is the worst person in your life and how would your life turn out if you haven't met him?,.
1262,How do i open a convo about my serious concerns with a new therapist?,"I have some pretty serious mental health issues (ive been on mood stabilizers and anti psychotics since i was 15, the only reason i havent been hospitalized is gross incompetency from my precious psychiatrist) and so far all my meetings with my new therapist have been ""get to know you"" ""how was life growing up"" type questions, and i dont know how to bring up my more serious issues to him. 

im still looking for a new psychiatrist thats in network (thanks a lot BC) and i can afford after my previous decided to cancel all my refills bc i didnt want to start a new medication (abilify) when seroquel, the one ive been on for almost 4 years has never had any issues and she changed the prescription w/o ever consulting me. Because of this (and past issues with the psych) im leaving that practice all together, while i never was 100% comfortable there bc of the management issues i really liked my therapist and we spent years building a bond and trust. Losing that has really taken a toll on my mental health, i need to talk about the important shit that is really hurting me but i have no idea how to talk to this person i have no real relationship with. 

any advice for opening up to a new therapist; any help would be appreciated?  

feel free to ask questions, ill do my bast to answer them"
1263,Wellbutrin and caffeine...,"I take 300mg of Wellbutrin daily to help with depression (just diagnosed last year.), and I drink a fair amount of caffeine daily(16-30oz), and I take a multivitamin daily. I still always find myself feeling tired all the time and unmotivated. I've also had blood work, it's not my thyroid. Is it just depression making me feel like this?"

1265,Bulimia question?,"In my nutrition class bulimia is defined as recurrent episodes of binging followed by some form of purging (vomiting, laxatives, excessive exercise, not eating.)

1267,I hate my feelings and myself and I don’t know how to change it,"Do you know that feeling when your friends are always more successful and luckier than you are? I’ve been calling this one work place for a week without success (no answer) so eventually I had to send an e-mail. I just opened my snapchat and saw that my friend just were on a job interview at that same place, went well aswell. Now this is difficult to explain, but I’m just annoyed at the whole situation. She started studying the same thing as me one year after me, but she’s been much luckier with the work places and internships. Now, she deserves this 100%, but I’m annoyed at that I always seem to pick the ”short stick”. I’m afraid that I will be unsuccessful my whole life, just because I’m an idiot and even though I’m a very hard worker, I don’t work in a smart way. I always seem to make my life so much harder than it should, and I hate myself for it. I wish I could follow the Nike logo and ”just do it”, but I’m a introverted, shy person, and everything seems to be a bit harder for me. Could you please help me change my feelings. I wish I could stop feeling jealous and hating myself."
1268,I'm attached to my teacher,"This is my first reddit post so sorry for mistakes.

So imma give you a backstory so you could better understand what I'm going through. This briefly mentions a few sensitive topics (alcohol, mental health and attachment issues) but I'm not gonna make it graphic or anything. Skip a few paragraphs down if you don't wanna read the backstory and also I'm not in any danger as I now live at my dad's. 

So I was a happy kid, all my worries were as a kid was convincing my mom to buy me the next DS game to begging for a hamster. So pretty much what every average kid worries about. I always had loads of friends and I was always good and doing well in school despite of few issues at home.

However, this all changed as I got older (about 8 or 9 years old) my parents spilt up. To be honest I don't remember it being that impactful on me because as a kid I didn't really know what they meant. At first I handled it okay, but I started to be a little more sad than usual. Nothing serious but just the equivalent of me not getting a chocolate bar from the shop kinda sad. So I got referred to my primary school counsellor (obviously they couldn't really do much because I was only 9 turning 10 at this point and I was still in primary school.) and being honest I think it kinda helped.

Ever since I was young I've always had attachment issues, but as a kid it was pretty normal as most children were attached to their parents. But as I got older it didn't really seem to go away. Looking back though I can definitely see why.

My mom was and still is an alcoholic who refuses to admit she's wrong. As a child I was always sent up to my room when we had guests over and I was always 'protected' by her in a sense that meant I knew barely anything about the outside world. Growing up I was only taught the minimum basic needs (washing, bathing and manners) but I was never taught how to cook food or anything that was considered 'dangerous' in her books and whenever I would try to explore new things she would tell me they're dangerous and that I don't need them In my life. And still til this day I still don't know a few things. (yes I now  know how to take care of my needs if you were wondering) my mom's always believed that she knows what's best for me, even though it was clearly not. My mom's always been manipulative and has always made out to me that I'm a liar, b**ch you name it, she's said it. She would also use me as a way to get to my dad. She would constantly withhold me from seeing my dad and she would fill my head up with so many lies about him because of her jealously, she even gave me graphic details about his supposed 'affair' when I was 11 and as a child it didn't make me think highly of my dad. 

Every child no matter what age or gender needs their parents. Sure they will be able to grow to live without them but it takes a long time to do that. As I said before, as I got older my attachment never seemed to go away. I was attached to my mom despite her being an abusive alcoholic and I still love her. But my mom's emotionally abused me since she split up from my dad, through name calling, screaming and raging at me, punishing me with extreme punishments even though I did absolutely nothing, isolating me from the outside world and she's also physically abused me in the past. Which still scares me to this day. 

When you have an extreme attachment to someone your whole life revolves around them whether you like it or not. Every good interaction with that person makes you feel like you're on top of the world but every negative interaction makes you feel so low its unexplainable. The emotional pain truly turns into physical pain. As a kid my mom neglected me emotionally and I only saw my dad for 2 days a week and sometimes even less than that so I'm still getting there with my dad relationship and trust wise. 


 So I've always had that empty hole that's never been fulfilled. This is where I started to get extremely attached to the point where it was unhealthy. Specifically to one of my teachers. This teacher is honestly the nicest, positive teacher I've ever come across. She's always been welcoming and made me feel really happy with myself. She made me see that I am worth it and for a little while, I guess I could say I believed it. But once I'm attached I can't let go. I constantly re-think the whole conversation we had on the day and I always find something that I said wrong or something that I should've said. It's so hard because I think she's starting to catch onto it and I genuinely think she's weirded out by it. And I can't help but cry over it. Because my attachment is so extreme I can't even handle the fact that'll I'll be leaving school in a few years and that I'll never see her again. The pain is so painful it feels like a storm inside me. Getting stronger and more intense the more I think about it. Being honest I genuinely don't wanna be attached to her because if I had a student attached to me I would be slightly uncomfortable, so I see my side and hers. I have told her pretty much everything (apart from some of the extreme things that i haven't told anyone) and I cannot thank her enough for being there for me and listening. All she's ever been is nice to me, but my sensitive self always thinks that she hates me because of one of her actions, tone of voice or even the time when she told me that it's her work time. I get it. I honestly do. I understand it so much, I get that seeing me all the time is exhausting but I feel like I have no one left in a sense. I only wanna talk to her about my problems but then again she has her own problems like I have mine. Obviously. I just wish I could tell her how i truly feel, without her being weirded out or pushing me away. (pushing me away and neglecting me is honestly the worst pain for me so my mind constantly thinks about the past and makes up things that 'are gonna happen In the future' When they're obviously not going to.) 

I also get loads of nightmares about my mom and this teacher. The ones about my teacher mainly are about her neglecting me and telling me she doesn't wanna talk to me. Which hasn't happened but I still think now that it's going to. Even though she's the nicest person. 

Does anyone have any advice? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
1269,My story,"My story

I am young mid teens and I started DRDP after trying weed. Something that I was peer pressured to do by my own cousins. I hated it and remember vividly going into the high feelings horrible. Horrible as a person because I am this straight A student who is religious and never likes going against their parents. (Keep in mind my parents are great, they dont force me to be perfect but I have high standard for myself). At first it was so hard. It started 2019 summer after experiencing 2 traumas. And since my parents dont really know much about mental health they said it would leave. But they did not and they decided to take me to city for a vacation to clear my head. (Horrible moment of my life: DR like crazy). And as I kept going I struggled and struggled. Went through another trauma a few months later and the feelings while were consistently lessening it surely didnt help. 

My experience is a bit weird. I liked to think a lot before DR and after the high which I regret to this day and weighs a burden I noticed the patterns yet I struggle to see the process. For me I wake up very good. Very normal ready to start my day no DRDP symptoms. However as the day goes on it becomes to worsen and worsen. By the end of the day I feel so tired and frustrated. And the cycle repeats. My thoughts are strange I sometimes just forget i am a human with limbs and can do stuff. I forget the people around me and question if they are real. When I 100% know they are and that I am fine. My mind most of the time is blank when no one is talking to me. And its so annoying That i never feel like agile and have fast reaction time. I dont know what to do. I am hopeful and look forward to getting physically healthier. But I dont know what to keep doing. I read stories of people who have been like this for their lives and unlike most I want to fight. I want to return to my life. So I turn to reddit. What can I do? Meditation? Any methods that have worked for you?


Forgot to add: the dreams I have are crazy. I dream almost every night. They are insignificant dreams like idk buying a cat or something but I dream almost every night."
1270,Mental health and relationships,"I have a friend who been going through some shit with her current GF.

I'm trying to understand my friends reason behind forgiving this person time and time again after being hurt multiple times. 
I can't seem to understand. Am I wrong for not understanding? 
I'm worried. And I'm worried thing may escalate. 
She believes this girl cant change. I dont. 
Any thoughts?"
1271,I think I have a mental illness but I don’t know what it is,"The above pretty much explains what I’m talking about.


For a bit of background on me I am a thirteen year old female, in Australia, who has fairly good grades so far and horrible friendships.


My father is adopted so I don’t know much about his family history. But I do know that he suffers from a hereditary mental illness that makes him easily lose his temper. I do t know what the illness is as my family refuses to tell me but I have been told several times that I show symptoms of the mental illness.


I’ve done my share of research on hereditary mental illness to attempt to determine what is wrong with me but I’m at a loss and my mom avoids taking me to a therapist and likes to say I’m faking everything for attention if I try to explain to her why I suddenly lost my temper.


I’ll explain it best I can but I’m not great at words or explanations really.
It’s like I can be fine one second and content and then suddenly I’ll think about how I dropped something this morning and then my temper just explodes. Surprisingly I’m pretty good at hiding my emotions so no one has any clue that I’m mad.



Then there are times like this. This happens more often so than the sudden anger. I’ll be talking with my friends or just doing anything then something just comes over me and I feel giddy. Then I’ll do things like insult my friends or in general just say or do things that go too far, and internally I’m completely aware of what I’m doing but it’s like I’m just watching myself with no control over what I’m saying and doing even though inside I feel completely guilty and just want myself to shut up. It’s a terrifying feeling and it happens constantly.


I don’t know what’s wrong with me Reddit. I suspect BIPOLAR or Autism but I’m not an expert so I’m hoping someone with more knowledge can tell me something."

1273,If I could push a button to die without pain or possible fuck ups and surviving I would.,"I posted here not too long ago, really doing well, telling the story of my past and how I came to where I was a month ago.

&amp;#x200B;

later on my girlfriend who I adore expressed her thoughts of doubt in the relationship.

we broke up for about 16 hours and then text me saying she was overthinking things etc.

She expressed also that I was idolizing her and putting her before myself.

Ever since we've been back together I just feel all over the place, I don't understand it.

I've felt suicidal before in the past but now I just really don't see the point in anything anymore, nothing stays good, nothing works out, everything is doomed to fail"
1274,I cannot maintain stable friendships and hardly care about anything,"As the title suggests I am unable to maintain stable friendships. Since elementary school I always had a friend group that I talked to, but usually after less than a year I meet someone and they seem really cool. I start unconsciously hanging out with them more and more and then I almost completely abandon my ""old friends"". It is not my intent and in my younger years in elementary school I did not even realize it was happening. I realized it was happening over and over again when I was 13 (I'm freshly 16 now). I wanted to do something about it and it was working out for about a year and a half, but then I got into a big fight with them and couldn't hang out with them so I decided to hang out with some other people I kind of knew and It happened again in the matter of weeks. Now I rarely talk to my old friend group and talk more with the friends I abandoned my old friend group for. I can tell I am not as happy being with them compared to when I was with my old friend group again, but I don't wanna make the same mistake again and I am afraid I am going to. Now most of my old friends realize that I abandoned them and I get a lot of shit from them like about how I abandoned them, eventually abandon everyone and that I do not care about anyone. This week two people told me pretty much that and they do not even know each other. I think it is true even though I do not want it to be but I do not know how to fix it.

Another thing is the thing about how I do not care about anything and I think that might be also true. A few months back my dad accidentally ran over our dog when he was parking. When I got home and everyone was crying and burying our dog I was kind of just there. I do not think I felt anything. I thought I cared about him a lot but him dying was not really sad for me. I just kind of accepted it and moved on with my life pretty much instantly. I think I cared about him as much as I care about my friends, but if I did would I care If I lost my friends. I've always been in the mindset that I do not need anyone else but me. In a way it made me stronger but I think maybe I Isolated myself from everyone .

I am just very confused and do not know what to do. I do not want to talk about this with anyone, because I think I might be just a big crybaby and I do not want to bother people with my stupid problems. I just wanted to get this out of me somewhere anonymously and this seemed just like the right place. Sorry If I bothered with you with this but If you made it this far please give me some of your thoughts and feedback. I am sorry for any grammatic mistakes english is not my native language.

thank you"

1276,Sociopath or psychopath?,"Hello! I live in the US and I’m seeking advice for a family situation that’s come to light. I have PTSD from an incident with my older cousin who lives in Spain and a month ago (after some incriminating sexual comments at a family reunion) we decided to tell my extended family too. We’ve had trouble convincing some family members of him and it occurred to me that some of his traits fit the profile of a psychopath. However looking online, I can’t quite figure out if he is a psychopath or sociopath.

He is a very sexually promiscuous guy age 20. Most of his conversations are about sex and if not they lead to the topic. He is obsessed with his looks (to what degree I don’t know). He lies constantly and when he can’t get away with flat out lying then he is augmenting the story to paint himself in a better light. He carries himself intelligently but he did poorly in high school and doesn’t go to college (Everyone goes to college in my family). He works as a waiter right now. He is irresponsible and has had minor run ins in the law like vandalism or weed but I don’t think has ever been actually charged with anything. He is very charming which is what makes me think he has some of my family members fooled but there are little things that give away that it’s an act. Like he calls his girlfriend a throwaway fuckbuddy or he tells everyone his dad is a fuck up slob. 

I’m not asking for any official diagnosis but does this sound like the traits of a psychopath or a sociopath? Does this even sound like it could be either?"

For every great picture I have 50 pointless sketches that look mediocre at best and poor at worst. This is causing me to feel like my only talent isn't worth it,and it's making me feel like I would be better off dying...I'm having so many self worth issues and my art,something I've always held as the one talent I have is coming back to the source of these thoughts.

But they weren't. 

Wanna say to them ""if you wanna do something, then fuck off"" and I'll probably snap and say it

Also, my grandmother knows about it as my mother told her. She didn't tell me that directly, but she called me, while we don't speak to each other as she told my sister to drop out of school and take care of pigs. And she had audacity to scold me while I was venting to her about my parents.

She asked me to come and I stupidly agreed

Either I'll kill myself or I'll wait 4 more years to run away

Guess what's on my mind

Just fuck off

Is there a special name for someone who makes themself puke and then drinks wine to cover the taste? 

You know how you can take a couple shots sitting down and not feel the effects so much until you stand up? That’s how bloating works sometimes too

Washes over you
Like a wave
Knocks you from your feet
Gets you to your knees
Leaves you begging Please
Go away, don’t let my belly swell
Compress my outer shell

Stop

Where is this coming from
The root of the feeling
Won’t eat enough during the day and binge after everyone’s in bed
Why this time
Panic on Monday?
But why even did that happen
Feel out of control? 
Just hate my job?

Feel out of control because I hate my job and can’t leave it 

Feel out of control because (husbands) family is moving here? 
But I want them to move here, I’m excited for it

Feel out of control because 
Why

Do I even feel out of control? 
Is it something else?
Could it be just the having my weight measured last month
Has it been silently eating at me
Chipping away my resolve
My confidence that I’ve evolved 

What do I do now

Money’s the issue 
Counseling but can’t

Exercise is the affordablesooution
Can I do it

Why 
 
Can I force myself to get over it

A) Get over
B) Face it with counseling 
C) Face it with exercise and eating at meal times
D) pretend nothings wrong"

I will go event by event pretty much that explains these thoughts and fearful almost beliefs (as I can come to reality with my anxiety getting the best of me most of the time, which I remind myself of frequently).

I grew up in a well environment. The traumatic experience I’ve endured, is the loss of my younger brother, whilst I was in elementary school years. He was diagnosed with cancer as I was in 1st grade, and passed away when I was in 5th grade. I had believed and held firmly in hopes that he was going to live. My parents then had my younger sisters and I into counseling to then prepare us for his invulnerable death. 

The PTSD I suffer from this is catastrophic thoughts. I suffer from fearing the worst in many situations. For example, as I grew up, I would be so worried at medical appointments, especially the typical check up. I feared and worried heavily on whether they had checked my body, heart, lungs or blood pressure, that something was going to be wrong. 

When I say “wrong” I meant that something was going to come up as something fatal or serious. Although clearly that is a realistic thought, but very unlikely given I never had experienced any symptoms or abnormal issues prior to the visits.

- This past me I am about to be describing is essential to know these thoughts stem from a person I had used to be. 

I am absolutely a much better person today. To continue, I fear as if these people know something about my past self, based on 1 sided stories or just had seen the way I have acted back at a time.  

To keep it short. In the past I was careless, rude, inconsiderate and relative like words to mostly girls in the past. 

These few girls I had always known personally. I hardly ever initiated an issue with them, however when they had started an argument with me, and initiated an always verbal issue, I most definitely pressed that issue to lengths of it being inappropriate/and unnecessary. 

I never have ever threatened a girl, told them to end their life somehow, physically harmed them or got other people to harass them either. 

I really just called them terrible names and sometimes brought in personal matters if they had done so. This type of behavior was portrayed from 8th to a little part of 10th grade, as most people knew to just not fuck with me wrong. I was never a general bully though, I guess you could say my behavior was verbal bullying to those personal to me. 

As you know, word about someone who is well known can quickly travel, especially in high school. I had been for how strong I was known to be physically in size/pound for pound and also for the rude persona I had. I was also a very likable person too. I was and still am always there for friends or people in need of talking or sometimes small favors. Though bystanders mostly never see the good in those portrayed as a bad person by their friends.

I had preferred to suppress my feelings or not talk of them throughout most of my life up until a year ago, a bit after halfway through Junior year is when I really started to talk more openly. 

This form of how I suppressed myself is probably partially, may explain these angry verbal outbursts of inconsiderate word play. I controlled my physical actions very well.

Really though I had resorted to self medication with my parents Ambien. This habit that no longer continues, had begun sometime from the summer into 8th grade, up until my accidental overdose in the very beginning of my Junior year. 

I also smoked marijuana throughout most of high school. I started using it the summer into sophomore year, and the frequency of my use had became even more as time went on. 

During the middle of Junior year. I was on the wrestling team, and when I got injured. I couldn’t participate which heavily depressed me. As it made me feel worthless, a failure, and such. I couldn’t lift weights which was also a passion of mine to. I could only deadlift. 

Due to my prolonged suppression of feelings and irrational behavior, I would literally (very sad to admit) take the bar, and deadlift to scrape the living fuck out of my shins in the school weight room. Like this was so unnecessary. I was bleed so bad, but at that time, I didn’t care. I would then sometimes walk around after that class to another, in public where people could most certainly see, with the blood still up and down my shins. I literally did this for the stupidest reasons. To scare people into avoiding any negative interaction with me, to show people not to fuck with me. Although in reality I was self mutilating myself as someone would do with cutting. In reality this was just my mental illness starting to unfold in the minds of those who knew what mental illness could look like. 

These actions had obviously spread in rumors and talk, as I would idiotically fucking show off my shin scrapes from dead lift sessions to the media (instagram story or snap story). Boy did people have reasonable concerns. 

I committed these actions too with a bad coping mechanism with suppressive feelings, and the serious misuse of marijuana where the marijuana literally altered my mind.

Needless to say, shortly after these events, I was admitted into an inpatient hospital twice within a one month span. I firmly believe that these psychotic behaviors were heavily due to the heavy marijuana misuse, and I will put a link at the end of this.

To keep it short, again. The last hospitalization had changed my meds from Cymbalta (50mg) for depression, to Venlafaxine, which then caused a manic high to low switch. Which led to a bipolar diagnosis from a psychologist, a month later. 

After the last hospitalization, I became very passive. Avoided any negative interactions. Felt ashamed, embarrassed, and full of hatred towards my past wrongdoings. I did the only thing I could, I changed for myself, my family and friends. 

I do not think I am bipolar at all at all. Before the hospitalizations, I never endured any highs, lows, mania or psychosis. I guess you could consider the small timely events that led up to the initial hospitalization can be perceived as a low. The only manic state I have ever experienced was induced from the medication that discharged me with, that I had stopped shortly after. After I stopped the medication, the high went into a very bad low with much anxiety and moderate depression. 

This manic state went down during the summer, in June of 2019. When that was the last time I touched any substance aside from nicotine. 

When I quit smoking in June, due to the depression yet again becoming major from it whilst causing anorexia. 

I had became very hostile, angry, agitative for almost 2 months, then became to my opinion of the normal I have became today. The “normal” in August 2019 when those bad emotions from the withdrawal of THC had become very minimal, up until now where I feel to be the best I had ever been. 

- Maybe I’m having catastrophic like thinking as to I may fear having a form of paranoid schizophrenia, with reasoning in this case. Is this maybe as simple as that I just need some professional help with to become more in control with these thoughts/fears?

- I wouldn’t call these fears delusional beliefs. They almost a belief, although I also have the other 1/5 of my mind knowing that I am just not even considering that this people could be from somewhere else / don’t even know me / or any other logical consideration that could be better than what I partially assume.

- As today, I proudly haven’t used any substances in almost a year. I cope very well and have a great time talking about my feelings with a good friend of mine. I also relieve stress through music, driving and the gym.

- Here is what I experience on a daily basis, as you mostly know the essential now, for where these reasons stem from to these thoughts:

- At 17 years old, about to be 18 and graduated. I struggle with these catastrophic and intuitively emotionally/or logically based thoughts daily. 

-Some days are worse than others. Really I have fears and almost beliefs that people (usually around my age and especially women) are judging me or do not like me from who I was.

- This is especially at work. I work at the local Walmart in this larger town I have always lived in. I work in the fruits and veggies area, so always around other shoppers. 

- I fear and feel as if these people around my age (again especially girls), just know me from my past somehow. I feel this way when they just see me. Walk the other direction. Sometimes I even here them talking, not exactly what they are saying. Sometimes I may here a key word and then think, are they talking about me? 

- In traffic, I feel as if the person next or across to me, may know me somehow from my past. I also have catastrophic thought that the person behind me driving may be following me. I don’t assume this, as I’m more alert to if they follow me. Sometimes I’ll turn into other streets and such, on my way home to see if they are or if I’m just too much on edge.

- As time goes on, I do talk to myself or others about how I am really just overthinking and honestly this past month these thoughts have slowly began to become less frequent lately. 

- As this month I started to realize this is all my anxiety based on reasonable thoughts, however that’s some good news.

- This is mostly in public places, obviously. I really just genuinely fear the judgement and more so a misperception of who I am today compared to who I was honestly. I have changed so much and I hate to know that some people don’t believe that. 

— Thanks for reading and for any insightful input. I also do see a therapist too as of this month.

1283,just stopped caring?,"I don’t really feel depressed all the time anymore I just feel numbish but I still want to cry sometimes. I’ve stopped showering, dressing. I don’t leave my house and haven’t for like a year or two. I’m just kind of done. I don’t want to kill myself but i do want to die. I’ve kind of just stopped taking care of myself the last year - two. I was in therapy for all my stuff starting when i was 5 - 18 but I got sick of it. Medicine made things so much worse for me and I’d been on it about the same amount. we would change it but the results were never better. I don’t feel like living but Im good at convincing others I do.. even myself but it’s not for people or for anything important. It’s for things I have no use for anyway.. I obsess over things but in the end I don’t need it or even want it when I have it. I don’t laugh at anything for real anymore.. I mean sometimes but it’s insanely rare but I do put on a fake laugh when I feel it’s necessary. I don’t even know who it’s for. I feel horrible but I also feel really hollow. I don’t know what to do. I’m not even sure why I’m writing this as if Reddit would be helpful for anyone. I don’t know anyone who’s gone through what I have. I do have feelings though. They are really strong but I’m just don’t passionate about the things I talk about or the things I do or want to do. I am great at convincing others I am though but even as I’m speaking I’m just thinking “why am I even talking about this? what difference does me saying anything make”. I’m not lonely but I do want to talk to others when they are near me but not for connecting. I have adhd and a number of other things wrong with me. Anyways thx for tuning in.  #cantwaittohearyourjudgementalcomments 💗"
1284,Waking up,"Today I woke up, my body hurts everyday and I feel tired. I’m currently unemployed and I’m just tired. I started my routine as usual (I try) and I just broke down and got depressed and tired. My mind wants me to say the most outrageous things. I feel like I’m going to explode. I’m so extremely sad with no one to talk to that I don’t know why I’m sad anymore. I feel like I’m losing it and I’m
Just making shit up that doesn’t make sense, I wanna say things that I don’t know why and I just want to go to the hospital I’m just scared of being trapped. I’m just so tired I feel like I got no sleep but I slept 9 hours."
1285,I can’t do it anymore,Every day for my entire life I’ve been struggling on. No friends to talk to. If I try to talk to anyone about how my feel they give me this uncomfortable look and change the subject so I don’t talk anymore. I don’t think I can do it anymore. I just want the pain to stop. I seem fine to everyone. I just wish I had someone to talk to who would take me seriously. I don’t think anyone will unless I do something drastic. That’s the only way to get some help.
1286,On depression..,"So I’ve tired but failed to link my new IG account that I put up for support. If you want to follow it DM me! I have no sponsors or anything like that, just personal stories that I’m hoping will help others."
1287,I dont know if I'm displaying PTSD symptoms or not,"Disclaimer: I'm not using reddit to self diagnose, I just want to know if this is worth looking into further.

Some background info about me: 15, sex=female, gender=male, autistic, homeschooled, the youngest of two older siblings. Right, now that we have that outta the way... one of my parents was arrested and is now RUI (released under investigation) on suspicion of CP (if you know what this is, then you know). My other parents is looking after me and one of my siblings, the other lives on their own. Sometimes we'll go back up to my arrested parents house when he's not there, just so that we get our rooms back for a bit - the problem with this is that my room was right next to his, and my mind wont stop racing with disgusting and frankly terrifying scenarios. I've slept on the floor in my siblings room every time we've gone back up. When I try going to bed in my own room I have a panic attack and a really crazy urge to SH. He was an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive parent anyway, but this is the line for me. My mother recently got me men's cologne for the first time (hence why I mentioned being trans) but as soon as I put it on, I realised it smelt like my dad and I had to breathe through it for about 10 minutes. My imagination is heavily vivid at the best of times, but holy shit... I've seen things in my head that you wouldn't think could be made up. I'll hear the daydreams too, but they're like nightmares. I've had consistent day/night-mares for a couple of years but I cant take them any longer. Am I just having a weird reaction or is this a recognised medical thing of sorts?"
1288,"Struggled with my mental health for years but the last 6 months have been a struggle. Long term relationship ended horribly, and my Dad passed away. Can’t see anywhere out of this black hole","Firstly my gf and I broke up after 3 years and she had someone new within 5 weeks. She also wanted to cut all communication and act like I no longer exist. A few weeks later my Dad started to take ill health and he passed away a few weeks ago. Him and I were extremely close. I went to tell my ex as her and my Dad really were fond of each other and I thought she deserved to know. I literally just spent 2 mins telling her about Dad, and didn’t mention “us” or anything beyond my Dads passing. A few hours later she messaged saying I’m no longer part of her life and she doesn’t care what happens in my life and that if I see or contact her again she’ll get the police onto me. Needless to say it’s been a terrible month for me, losing my Dad and my ex reacting in such a way. I only have acquaintances rather than friends and I’m not close with my extended family. I see no light at the end of the tunnel and im in a deep depression. I don’t want antidepressants as I was on them years ago and they didn’t agree with me. Don’t know what else I should do to end this pain"
1289,Is there a way to learn empathy and not just fake it?,"I lack empathy. I literally do not care if your mom just died, I even might be slightly annoyed if it interferes with any of my plans. And I HATE being this way. I hate not feeling anything when my bf gets rejected for a job, I hate not caring about someone's injury that they had to have surgery for.

However, this does not mean that I won't consider their feelings. The opposite, I'd hate to do something that would hurt someone else's feelings. If a friend would tell me they needed me at 3am, I'd be there in an instant. I just do not feel empathy for whatever thing it is that they need me for in that moment.

I have always been told by my mom that I'm heartless. And I don't believe I am, I think I have a huge heart with lots of love to give for anyone who needs it. But I. Don't. Feel. Empathy.

Is there a way to learn how to feel for someone? How to feel with someone? For once I'd love to be able to give a genuine ""I'm sorry to hear that""."
1290,"I'm Unsure About Where to Continue, (if I should take my medication or not...)","**What's Going On?**

I have a sleep disorder called paradoxical insomnia. It's the extreme version where I never feel as if I'm sleeping and I never feel tired. My body is basically asleep while my brain is awake. I started talking to a psychiatrist about that and so far no sleep meds or antipsychotics have helped me.

I've read one or two case reports about a woman's paradoxical insomnia going away after a few ECT treatments. I asked my psychiatrist if she would consider ECT and she said that she couldn't until I tried another antidepressant first. I got prozac and I'm about a week in and I really don't want to take it. I don't feel depressed currently and I've been having anhedonia and a complete loss the ability to climax. I'm worried I have developed sexual dysfunction from or that I WILL if I continue to take it, it's called PSSD syndrome.

**Does it seem I REALLY need to be taking an SSRI? Can't I get ECT without being on one?**

Even when I would experience feelings of depression, my depression would always make me EXTREMELY tired. And on top of that I'm not feeling depressed currently. I really don't want to take an SSRI, I'd rather just get ECT all alone.

&amp;#x200B;

\****Side Note\* I know the risks of getting ECT, I've thought long and hard about this, so please don't come at me with stigma. I know that people can experience mild to severe memory loss, but you have not experienced the disorder that I have. It is awful and I am willing to risk that in ECT therapy. Imagine never having deep sleep again and feeling conscious for 6 months, it is hell.***"
1291,I’m struggling,"Since Christmas I’ve been gradually going downhill. I’ve stopped eating, stopped attending my university classes, I have no more clean pairs of underwear, my house is so disgusting now that it smells, and honestly I just can’t make myself do anything about any of it. I don’t even feel any emotion most the time, until I see my boyfriend or call my mum and then I just start crying. My family is 4 hours away though and my boyfriend is so exhausted from working long shifts in a mental health hospital everyday without even getting paid (student nurse life for ya). They all want to help but really they’re just unable to due to circumstance, and I don’t know what they could do anyway. I just feel like I’ve hit a dead end. I don’t actively want to die but I have absolutely no motivation to live anymore. When I talk to people I can hold it together and think logically and think of practical solutions but as soon as I’m left to my own devices I’m unable to put any of them in place. I just don’t know what to do."
1292,"What is everyone's opinion to a zero tolerance rule with therapists and suicide? If I told a mental health professional I was considering suicide, they would hospitalize me more or less on the spot..Wouldn't that reduce the people speaking out about these feelings? F-that, I'm not being hospitalized","More or less explained in the title.
My local mental health walk in clinic has this rule.. Probably the doctors walk in clinic, ect.

And I have a child on the way.,"I really need any advice I can get at the moment, my life feels like it’s going down the drain. I don’t know how much more of this I can take. Before meeting my ex things wasn’t great but they wasn’t the worst time of my life either, cut a long story short me and my ex got speaking and everything was going great up until a few weeks after she found out she was pregnant. Since then I was the worst person in the world she hates me to this day is talking rubbish behind my back to mutual people.. I don’t know if it’s getting back to her that I know all she’s saying, couldn’t really care either but she’s been telling this mutual person that I’m not gonna be seeing my son on my own. And to find out that through someone else is absolutely heartbreaking and I don’t know how much more of this I can take, she used my mental health against me one time bringing up my sh scars and saying it proves I wanted to kms. She’s also telling people I trapped her when in reality before she got pregnant I wasn’t even sure I wanted a child, I feel I’m not ready for a child I’m not mentally prepared for it she’s also said that before. That I’m not mentally stable enough for a child because I said she’s childish and not old enough mentally(I stand by that to this day) I’ve been feeling quite suicidal recently even more so than before, I suffer from a borderline personality disorder and it really does suck I’ve hurt myself in numerous different ways and been thinking of doing some of the stuff again, I just feel useless, pathetic, and a failure to my son. I’d never hurt my child ever I don’t understand I think it’s just anything to spite me I’m scared I really am. I’ve been to the doctors and my doctor is really great but he’s just another doctor at the end of the day he just wants to prescribe me something. Been off my meds for a few months I’ve been more clear on things but my voices and seeing stuff is quite bad recently I don’t know if it’s due to not having my medication or because I’m really stressed with what’s going on.

1299,I don't know what to say when people (like my boyfriend) ask how they can help me.,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety since middle school. Ive seen therapists on and off since then. I have recently entered college and it's been worse. I talk to my boyfriend and my family about and everytime I do, i get asked ""is there anything I can do?"". I never know what to say and I feel bad because I can't come up with anything.

1304,"My fiance has symptoms of psychotic episodes, but refuses help","Without going into a huge backstory, I'll just say that sometimes when she takes certain meds (and she's on a lot of them, because she has terminal lupus), she has about 9 of the 10 symptoms in this list: [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201610/10-subtle-signs-psychosis](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201610/10-subtle-signs-psychosis) I don't know which med it is, but I suspect it's Oxy.

She gets paranoid, delusional, irritable, irrational, angry, emotionally abusive. Me and her teenage kids attempted to stage an intervention last night to help her, but she refuses to accept that there is anything wrong; so even though we tell her that something is wrong medically and that's not really her fault and it isn't her, she hears that and assumes we're wrong about the medical part so we are blaming her for it all.

My therapist called the police on her last night, when a pistol came up missing in the house. Now, it didn't have the magazine, and cannot be fire without it, but there's ***no*** situation where a missing pistol does not escalate everything. She claims she was scared I was going to do something to her or her daughters.

What's telling is the first thing she said when she found out the cops were coming was ""you just lost me pain management"". That means that she would choose drugs over her own sanity, and her own family.

She usually breaks up with me during these episodes, but clearly doesn't mean it, because she always comes back. However, at this point, I have to put my foot down and tell her that we aren't going to go back without doctors and therapists involved. I can no longer be as complacent as I have been, it's not good for me, or for the children, or for her.

I have a mental illness myself, I go to therapy for it. She can too.

We all know this isn't who she really is, but it's still hurts like hell when she says the things she does.

How do we get her help?"
1305,Finding it really hard to accept rejection lately,"So I’ve been in a relationship for 6 years with my boyfriend and we get along really well, we don’t live together but we see each other usually 3 times a week with college and work etc. Bipolar, addiction and other personality disorders are pretty common in my family (only on my dads side) when I was 15/16 I was diagnosed with depression by my local gp (not taking and never have taken any meds). I used to see a counsellor and she was great but I also felt I couldn’t fully open up to her and I felt like I would be judged. It’s been years since I’ve spoken to a professional about my mental health but it’s been plummeting lately. I find I’m taking things really personally and I’m in a bit of a rut at the moment, I’ve been getting stressed out and overwhelmed and just feeling really low for the last while (few months).

A new thing for me is I’m finding rejection particularly hard. For example I asked my boyfriend to come over tonight to which he said no as he was too tired after college. I do understand why he wouldn’t come over as he was tired but my brain won’t accept that he won’t come over and I’m taking it super personally. I’m quite clingy and I’d see my boyfriend every day if I could and this is obviously an unhealthy obsession on my end but it’s really causing a ton of negativity in the relationship and it’s causing me to get upset and freak out. I’m alone tonight in the house and my brain is on overdrive and I’m not in the best place at the moment. My boyfriend knows all of this as I talk to himself and my friends to help me mentally as I ament seeing anyone(professional)  at the moment. 

I can’t describe the feeling and I understand some of it is self pity as I didn’t want to be alone tonight. My brain just won’t accept no for an answer when he says he can’t see me. We’ve spoken about it before and it does cause fights, it’s a touchy subject in our relationship.

Does anyone else find rejection really hard. Not even on a big scale just something small like not seeing your friends or S/O. If yes how have you learned to accept it or cope with it and not take it personally?"
1306,I feel like I have ADHD but no treatment available?,"
TLDR; I’m 90 percent sure I have adhd but parents assume I just want drugs even though my stress levels and academics are severely impacted by it and I don’t know what to do. :(



So uh I’m 14F, and I’m currently a freshman in high school. My whole life I’ve been very scatter brained, I would always daydream EXCESSIVELY and school was a constant struggle. I know I’m not stupid, I score high on tests and am in all honors classes but I always feel like I’m behind on work wither form forgetting it exists or losing it. I’ve always assumed this was just my personality. I’m super jittery, and I often will black out and stare at random places for long periods of time, just thinking without realizing. I always Th ought this was normal behavior. Throughout the day I’ll have cycles of either being incredibly annoying, talkative, and energetic then immediately afterward being silent, moody and reserved; once again I assumed it was just the way I am. I constantly forget things, and if I remember to write them down I end up forgetting to check my planner or calendar so I end up forgetting them anyways. It gets to the point where every single day I am forgetting something that I absolutely need, not just sometimes, EverY dAmN dAy. Until one day I was on tik tok and there was one about having adhd where a girl lists all of the symptoms she gets with adhd and I just thought to myself “wait a minute I legit have all of theSe 0 . o” I then proceeded to do some research on adhd in girls and I check out with literally every one, not one single trait do I miss. I then present this theory of having adhd to my parents.

My dad immediately asks me in a sarcastic way “what, you want drugs?”. He’s always really paranoid about my behavior which is the norm even though I’ve done absolutely no drugs or alcohol ever :( Anyways I explain that no, I don’t want drugs I’m just wondering if this is the reason why I’m so scatterbrained and have issues in school. My mother says I probably do have adhd but that even if we went to a doctor about it, they’d just give me medications that would “turn me into a lifeless zombie” she claims that this hypothesized adhd is what makes me myself and that along with all the bad aspects (scatterbrained, etc), it also is what makes me so ambitious and energetic. My mom doesn’t even want to take me to the doctor beach’s all they’ll do is give me meds and she doesn’t want me to take any. 

I’ve been really stressed lately which only increases my messiness and forgetfulness. I don’t know what to do with this newfound idea of adhd and I have no clue how to help myself or even if I can. My dad just says to write stuff down more and pack at night instead of the morning but I swear I’ve tried it all already. I’ll end up forgetting to pack something then assume everything’s packed up in the morning and head on my way to school oblivious. Writing things down doesn’t help as stated before and I just don’t know what else to do, since I’ve tried everything already. I feel like I can’t talk to my parents about it anymore because they’ll just further assume I just want the Adderall and a nice little label to use as an excuse. I just want to fix myself. What can I do to help myself without any pills or doctors? What can I do to help my parents understand my struggles and that I’m seriously affected by this? Anything helps. 

Sorry for the rant, any suggestions? &lt;3"
1307,A worse current situation than mine?,"I haven’t left my house too much for about 2 years. I find it insanely hard to do basic things such as shower and change my clothes. i took meds and went to therapy for 14 years. Nothing has helped. I know I had a bad childhood.
I know I had bad upbringing and still struggle with all of my disabilities every day. I’ve tried everything. Does anyone have any worse stories or anything? If not please just go somewhere else. I don’t want help. I literally tried everything."
1308,How did you make yourself seek help?,"I know I need help and I need  to make an appointment but my anxiety is killing me and I can't do it. I'm a psychology student and it makes me so angry that I'm not capable of doing this and helping myself..but I think I could help others(yeah, sure). I feel like such a loser and guess I should choose different profession. I suffer  from panic attacks, anxiety and depression. I can't even leave my house without feeling stressed. I jump on every sound I hear. How can I get over this feeling and finally seek help? Did anyone have similar problem?"
1309,If you care actually listen to what I'm saying!,"So I've went through a nasty breakup where the ex has slandered me since, beat colon cancer, and I'm a fight to see my son and all of this in the past year.

Recently I started dating again because it's what I need to move on in my eyes from things and help me recover, and not even at the expense of the fight of my son, and everyone tells me I'm wrong.

So I seek therapy, I'm told to man up.

Meds, I'm told I should just go for a walk and exercise (ridiculous as I'm stupidly physically active anyway).

I've been told to change my diet, outlook, even that I shouldn't miss my dog at all that my ex got rid of because ""I should focus on my son"", which I fucking am.

And then when it all comes to a head, I feel suicidal, and make an attempt. They all crawl out the woodwork saying I should have talked to them and that they all care for me.

Now I'm suicidal, on the edge again and have even prepared a plan to carry this shit out; and a lot of that is because I'm alone because nobody will care till I actually end my life!

Christ. I needed to rant. I'm not even sure this is the right place for it but I needed to get this out there."
1310,What exactly is wrong with me,"I'm Marque, pronounced Mar'kway, 15 years old. So I think I have mood disorders, Personality Disorders, thought disorders, or whatever. AvPD with comorbid asperger's maybe. Probably because of my substance use disorder. I'm isolating myself, I feel as though I'm socially inept and I'm suffering from depersonalization whenever I'm in any social setting, even with my family. The way I interact leaves me wishing I hadn't at all. I'm convinced the more I use weed, the worse I get. I feel as though I'm developing symptoms of schizophrenia, as if it's schizoaffective disorder or schizotypal personality disorder. I avoid interacting, I guess I'm suffering from lots of depressive episodes, which only change when I'm around certain people, which isn't often. The way I communicate and interpret cues leaves every interaction feeling unsatisfying. There's like this barrier of fear and inhibition that prevents me from ever expressing myself. So I rarely express myself. I guess I have a flat effect when I'm in a low mood, and a tendency to avoid interaction at all costs, lest I feel super anxious. The anxiety I feel caused me to stop going to school (though I do independent study so I'm accounted for), as well as stop seeing my friends, prevents me from making friends, or even enjoy conversation at all most of the time. I like to say I don't trust my thoughts and doubt i can express them efficiently, and through trail and error, after error, after error, I've lost faith in myself and my ability to connect. I tried to stop smoking weed, like recently actually, but I always end up smoking a panic inducing bowl or blunt, and my highs are like insanity trips that make me wish I were dead. I nervously tic, and overthink, constantly ruminating the worst of the worst. Though you'd just think I'm a little awkward or shy at first glance, I'm full on panicking under my mask of apathy. I feel like people only interpret my uncomfortable or anxious cues, which seems to be the majority of my character these days. I take myself as a schizoid. the •_• bored looking guy. But when I'm either high or anxious, people interacting with me makes my expression shift into an uncomfortable grimace.
Apparently I was always a shy kid while growing up, yet ironically I didn't mind being the center of attention or making a lot of noise so people could react to me or whatever. So I was always socially off foot with my peers. I remember I was the type to have one or two close friends at a time, until I realized in middle school that I could barely make friends with anyone outside of my group. At first I thought I was socially awkward, with a generally annoying personality. I used to spend way too much time with my 'best friend' (kind of a narcissistic, or selfish dickhead. I dont wanna assume *everyone* has a malicious mental disorder) from the 5th grade up until the 7th or 8th. I stayed at his house in his room with him all day for a long time, until I finally went home. (He complained about my presence. He always found subtle ways to put me down but we enjoyed each others company nonetheless). I stayed at my grandmas, since we were in the process of moving actually. I don't know if it was weed withdrawal or an absence of a codepentant partner that made me obsess over small routines from Competitive guides for pokèmon games to going to school and completing various tasks. I'd feel this tense stress, while obsessing over how to enjoy my time and hobbies, I even cried once. I decided I didn't wanna go to school. I remember being made fun of because I 'talked white', and feeling anxious in certain classrooms and around the students. I felt like I was just too different to fit in, and the thought of being 'found out', or realized as a bad inadequate person scared me. I felt a bit depressed, and refused to leave my grandmother's bedroom.
Around this time I started smoking weed. I'd used it once before, but never again afterwards, until smoking it once with my older brother. After a while it became uncomfortable. I started to hang around my other brother literally from another mother and we smoked a lot more, after a while it became less euphoric as my tolerance grew and only made me anxious. simultaneously, I felt my self esteem diminish, as my self consciousness increased. my social anxiety flared. I was convinced that my social ineptitude would only be detrimental to myself or my peers, and that I just couldn't fit in. I could only ""be myself"" around my friends, and in other setting I was too anxious. My mood would feel low and I'd feel too inhibited to even speak out loud, or make eye contact. I don't exactly know the relationship between weed and whatever complex I had, what with my poor self esteem and mentality, that left me unwilling to interact because of some irrational fear, though I do know that the more I smoked the more I wanted to smoke. I know that when I smoked, especially with my brother from the same mother, I anticipated unsuccessful interaction much more. I'd simply not know how to respond, which left me extremely anxious. I'd panic, my thoughts felt rapid, and frenzied, and sometimes I'd talk and regret it. I'm convinced that I have AvPD, which is causing my mental health to deteriorate, and that my inadequacies were enhanced with marijuana use. I'm also convinced I suffer from substance induced psychosis symptoms. It's been like this for years. I keep getting high and panicking, and isolating myself because of fear. I barely even speak, or interact. I feel my communication skills have suffered. I'm convinced I'll develop schizophrenia and lose my mind if I don't get over whatever is taking my life over.
I feel cynical. I think I give off Covert Narccistic vibes. Which is crazy because I feel so much hypersensitive empathy at times, maybe because being high makes all my perception and paranoia all out of control or whatever. Though to be fair, all that's been on my mind for years and years is my own mental health. I can't get ""what's wrong with me"" out of my head. Lately I've been spending a lot of time stressing, feeling like I have something to do, something I have to be doing in order to amount to something. The same feeling that prevents me from enjoying cartoons or if I can't commit to a binge. I feel slighted at the slightest provocation, like when a therapist says ""you look so serious"" as a joke then chuckles, or when a teacher says ""you look happy to be here"" as an ironic joke, followed by a chuckle. F**king comedians.
I also have the emotional sensitivity of a borderline at times. One time I had a dream that I was being rejected and turned down by countless peers. This was following a day I felt so much negative things, like irritability, fear, self loathing, regret, rumination, shame, embarrassment, all because my little cousin was visiting and he managed to break me out of my shell, which made me vulnerable to being myself. I woke up, and decided to sleep in the living room because it was warmer. My mom's boyfriend asked (in what I swore could've been in a patronizing tone) ""Get too cold in your room?"" in which I responded with explosive anger. escalating from the ""do you think you're funny"" to the screaming ""I'll kill you"" at the top of my lungs as he restrained me type of anger. I didn't appreciate the fact that he was trying to intimidate me, in response to my provocation. One time (before the I'll kill you bit) I slapped my brother without thinking, since he kept trying to drag on an argument that made me feel some type of way, and we started fighting. Afterwards I cried, and said ""I don't wanna be around anyone that makes me feel this way, he always puts me down. yadda yadda, he's self absorbed, yadda yadda, I wanna go home"". Similarly, shortly thereafter, I kept feuling the tension with my mom, saying things like ""do you think I'm stupid? I dont appreciate your tone of voice. fuck your car. yadda yadda"". I kept shitting on the entire family for being ""dysfunctional"" until she called me a name, that I merely flatly repeated (it was rhetorical,  just dont call people names that'll make you cry) and she cried, which made me cry but I only vented to my brother. I heard her insulting me and my 'favorite' brother and went back, crying, in an exasperated voice I managed to get in her face and point my finger and call her ""shallow and petty"". I just felt like she was deliberately sabotaging my confidence for some reason. Which would make some sense, my family is toxic, they put you down behind your back or to your face. It's like you're punished for being an individual. You can't even enjoy an indie song without being ridiculed. You can't even play experimental underground rap without someone gaslighting your intrests. I'm fully convinced my family is plagued by psychological evil but I'm really getting off track here. 
I smoke way too much, to the point where I'm anxious, panicking, and on the verge of insanity. I doubt my social ability constantly, and I feel out of touch with reality. All there is is fear, doubt, inhibition, etc. I think I'm exhibiting some positive and negative as well as cognitive  behavioral symptoms that may underline some sort of psychotic issue. And I'd blame it almost entirely on weed, if not my environmental factors and traumatic, negligent upringing. I feel like I'm just sabotaging my health until I lose my mind. I hate that I can't explain it in depth. I read a forum about weed and symptoms. Just refer to University of Washington, Effects of Marijuana on Mental Health: psychotic disorders, Susan A. Stoner, PhD, Research consultant from the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute, or ADAI. (Idk how to format those things)

So to neatly end this thing, 
I've been smoking regularly since I was 13, though I first smoked when I was 12. And now I'm 15. Going to a new school made me feel anxious, to the point where i didn't wanna go. I'd stay home, depressed. And that mentality worsened as I aged, and smoked, to the point where I feel like I'm going insane because of all the sensations I'm too dumb to fully describe. 
Yours truly,
Teen with self diagnosed Avoidant personality disorder, maybe schizoid and/or schizotypal personality disorder, Substance use disorder, social anxiety disorder, moderate depression, a codependency disorder, selective mutism, a depressive disorder, I wanna lean towards schizoaffective disorder,  I dunno, I should see a psychiatrist"
1311,Rough day,"I felt super sad when I woke up, and then I cleaned my living room, kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom because I was so anxious and now I’m laying on my bed under my weighted blanket in the dark listening to James Taylor, Frank Sinatra, and Andy Williams and watching my pet fish Edmund swim around. I feel really sad and numb at the same time which doesn’t make sense to me"
1312,"My friend was ""escorted"" to the hospital 2 days ago","He sent me a text 2 mornings ago saying he was currently being ""escorted' to the hospital and then said he wouldn't be able to explain what happened, but there was another message at 12:30 (I had just gone to bed) when he asked me to talk to him urgently.. I saw the message when I woke up and texted him and he said that. He has since been able to not communicate with me, so I am asking here if anyone has an idea as to what is going on. I care deeply about him and we talk, he is 2 years younger than me and still in high school so I try to give him advice and he trusts me. (Without giving too much info he comes from an abusive household) 

Does anyone know why he wouldn't be able to respond? I am concerned."
1313,What do I do?,"My mum constantly spews shit out of her mouth. And it pisses me off. To give you an example. Racism, sexism and believes anything the internet says. She's just plain stupid. 

I'm very depressed and suicidal, and that shit just makes me worse. When I tell at her to fuck up she storms of and throws a tantrum. 

I wanna move out but I don't have anywhere to go (also  14 year old girl) I also have no friends. I'm almost constantly angry at home and wanna rip my hair out."
1314,Asking for direction,"So this is my first ever post and I just wanted some feedback.

I’ve just been diagnosed with PSTD from years of emotional abuse and I still question if things were actually bad or if I’m just “playing the victim” as I get told.  

I have been raped, drugged, and molested. I’ve been given hallucinagens as a child, and left in the middle of nowhere to find my way home.  My ex partner used to say he wouldn’t touch me because I was fat (80kg while he was 115kg)
I’ve had a best friend kill himself and had death threats from my father for being distant.

There is more that I could tell but my “friends” tell me I’m just being dramatic or playing the victim if I try to say anything. 

I just don’t know who to listen to anymore so any feedback is welcome. Am I being over sensitive?"
1315,I struggle when alone and bored,"Ok so this is my first ever post to this community and a throwaway account. I’m currently studying for exams and in general am under a lot of pressure to get into a academic university. However after my studies and just in general, If I’m not socialising or I’m bored, I feel awful. I wouldn’t call it depression but it’s what I imagine it to be like. It’s like a short episode I get regularly. I usually go to sleep and wake up feeling better. Then when I have nothing on later in my day after my studies I back in the ‘episode’. It’s like a existential crisis of just crushing boredom in a way. How do I handle this? Any thoughts or comments appreciated."
1316,Triggered by the mention of mental health,"Sorry if this is hard to make sense of.. But I need help

Tldr, Basically, someone ruined mental health publicity for me.  She hurt a lot of people with what turned into her selfishness. And I am now triggered by my own breakdowns?

I used to be all for me and others being more open about our struggles.  It has been slammed behind iron doors and locked away..

Where and how do I start with moving on?

Original:

I have PTSD from a few different situations, but I am experiencing a completely new issue and it is rapidly destroying me.  I [very] recently moved and have not been able to schedule with a new therapist, as I've only been here a week.  I have not been able to talk to a professional about this most recent trauma(or even verify if this one is also PTSD or something else), so im coming here for some temporary help to maybe hold me by?  I am also hesitant to talk about it because in my head it sounds absolutely ridiculous. I'm even aware its nuts, but I can't stop the emotions from ruining me. And I know I'm going to most likely end up a mess while typing this, so I'm sorry if it ends up a disaster to read.

I have struggled with some form of somewhat manageable mental health since I was about 9 or 10, and have also been through a few traumatizing events to throw PTSD into the mix.   I try my best to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but we all break down every now and then.  But now, every time I break down, or even read other people's mental health posts, memes, or anything, I panic and feel sick.  I am growing to hate the mere mention of mental health..  All after an EX best friend of several years really hurt me.  They were all about constantly talking about MH, sharing memes, trying to be relatable, etc. I didnt mind because I knew I wasn't alone, etc. 

On top of all of this, I went through a rough and heartbreaking divorce in 2019 as well. (Not the same person)

Towards the end of our friendship, (which ended on Christmas Eve, of all days,) she became a lot more abusive than she used to be, and really really hurt me at the end.  Without going on about details, which is less important right now, it really messed me up. Bad.  Even the mention of her name sends me into an anxious fit. I hallucinate, hear her, everything. It's awful.  

This event somehow ""contaminated"" mental health for me.  I even hate coming to MH reddit forums now, and haven't posted here in a long time, but im at my breaking point.  Any time I become depressed, suicidal, or anything, it triggers thoughts of her, and it worsens my emotions dramatically.  I rarely would post on social media before about mental health. I hate the fear of being accused of being an ""attention seeker.""  But recently I have allowed myself to vent in a small and private Snap story and I guess here now... 

I guess what I mean im getting to is even venting to close friends when I really need it is triggering even worse episodes.. Then the cycle feeds itself. 

I need to get her out of my head. I want to stop hearing her voice and bitch me out for every little thing I do even though we haven't spoken in 2 months.

It makes me sick and I feel like it's all nonsense, and unfortunately this isnt my only problem right now.. I dont know what to do..

Again, i apologize if this is a mess.

*reposting in this forum cuz I guess the one I tried before wasnt the best one*"
1317,Tips on dating with mental illness?,"So I am 24 and I feel like now is the time for mw to start seriously looking at a relationship.

But there are some things that are concerning me. I have schizoaffective disorder and while I am doing well right now (and plan to be in the future- have a decent job/degree/medication regimen) I just dont know what the future holds. 

I want things out of life, but I dont know if I can get them.

Is it even fair for me to get them? Is it impossible? If I were to start dating... when do I disclose the fact that I have an illness? When is fair? The thing is- I know its going to scare most people away and that is going to hurt and Im not sure if I can handle that.

It seems like everyone my age is already together. Is dating. Happy. I feel so behind. 

So anyone reading this. How do you handle mental illness and dating? Any tips?"
1318,Recently diagnosed with health anxiety + OCD and confused,
1319,I prefer to fail.,"Throughout my life I've been, like many others, have been putting as little effort as possible into everything. Recently I realized that in the end I feel that I'd rather be a failure and a disappointment subconsciously. It's gotten to the point to which, no matter how hard I try, I'm always extremely disappointed in myself and my capabilities. 

Lately I've been trying to dig myself out of a pretty serious depression through drawing. But no matter how long I work on a drawing I find that it's always missing something. I find that I'm never good enough. And through this I've found that's how I feel towards everything in my life. 

I'm currently in college, and I'm about to end up dropping out. I just can't handle working in classes that I feel in my gut I'm not capable, nor deserving of passing. Sure I get energized sometimes and feel like I can do it. But when the going gets tough, I quit.

I'm tired of it. I don't know how to break this habit or whatever you call it. I've tried everything I can think of, atleast I've convinced myself I have.

If anyone has any advice or if anyone can atleast relate I'd love to hear about it. Thanks for reading friend! :)"
1320,"How do I trust that decisions I make are what I truly want, and not the depression speaking?","I’ve struggled extremely with anxiety for the past couple of years and recently went in for a true diagnosis of other mental health issues, and was told I am very high in depression.

As with depression, I’ve been feeling empty/ numb lately. And that has carried over to my relationship with my boyfriend. He’s sweet and supportive but I feel like I’m not growing with him. He doesn’t push me to be better nor motivates me to be better. Or is it wrong of me to think a partner has to do that? Or is it the depression and numbness that is making me feel like I wouldn’t be better or worse with or without him? I’m not sure what to do but I just don’t want to make a wrong decision, if it really is just my mental health issues that are clouding my judgment. And to clarify, he doesn’t worsen my mental health issues.

Anyone have advice or experience on this? I’m REALLY not looking for everyone to be on my side or 100% positivity and support, I just want straight answers/ truth."
1321,has anyone ever heard of a panic attack lasting days?," My boyfriend woke up on Monday morning and has been having a series of panic attacks ever since (it's now Thursday night). Basically the only times he gets any relief are either when he's sleeping, or after taking xanax. Could these panic attacks go on indefinitely? What should I do to help him"
1322,Does graduation even matter?,"It's taken me 5 years to get an associate's degree. It has literally caused me blood, sweat, and tears. I know an associates isn't a big deal to a lot of people but it's really important to me. I have always struggled with school and suddenly I'm making the honor roll and graduating. The issue I'm having is none of my friends, family, or even husband seem to think it's that important. It's not that anyone has said it specifically but actions speak louder than words. My husband is more excited about a guys trip to the lake. My friends are more focused on a trip to the lake the same weekend as graduation. My parents aren't as excited because my brother is getting his masters degree and having a kid. Maybe it's really not a big deal. Is there even a point to walking? 24 hours ago I was so happy and proud of myself. I've never been proud of myself. In 23 years I feel like I've never done anything worth noting except this but the people who matter most to me just don't seem to care. Sorry for the long post. I just needed to get this off my chest."
1323,Self harm behaviors starting as a toddler,"I’ve struggled with self harm my entire life. When I was a young child I would have fits of beating myself and screaming that I wanted to die. It then turned into punching things until my knuckles bled, and then eventually I started cutting. I have a history of child abuse, so that might explain why I’ve been suicidal since I was 6 years old. It’s hard to stop because I’ve been using it to cope my entire life. I really want to stop though. 

Has anyone else here struggled with this??"
1324,please can someone message me for like five minutes really sorry,"sorry to be an annoyance but i have no one to talk to rn, it's nearly 2 in the morning and the only person i know who's up at this time is my sibling and they're doing uni work.

1325,Leaving work,"Hey guys,

I am bi polar, and have depression and anxiety. Was diagnosed about 5 years ago. Anyways, this past month things have been really bad for me mentally the past month. I’ve always thought about suicide before but would never do it. But this past month I have come up with plans and how to do it. I still don’t think I would ever have the guts to do it. But sometimes I just want to escape my brain.  So obviously I’ve been extremely suicidal lately. I take three meds. Lamictal and klonopin and one for my hyperthyroid. I am married and have two kids. 

Anyways, I just landed a reallllly good job at a bank and just started on Monday. Well I’ve been so bad lately that it’s affecting my relationship with my wife and kids. So my mom and wife are begging me to get admitted and want to take me in tomorrow at noon for inpatient. 

How should I approach tomorrow. I don’t want to have an embarrassing talk to my manager about how I am suicidal, she might look at me differently. Should I call hr and tell them? Idk I realllllllly don’t want to lose this job but my mental health is really important."
1326,Is it normal when highly stressed to have a constant monologue of chatter criticising your every move,"When I'm highly stressed I have voices constantly in my head of people family members people who don't even exist criticising everything I do and think.

My stress levels get away from themselves and this is what happens .

Everyday when my stress is this high I feel I'm heading for a breakdown.

Does this sound like schizophrenia that is brought in mostly by high stress"
1327,Why can’t I do things by myself?,"I don’t think I’ve done anything by myself in the 17 years I’ve been alive. I can’t order my own food, I can’t shop for myself, I can’t answer questions about myself to my doctor or anybody actually, sometimes I can’t walk to the bathroom by myself, I can’t even pick out my own clothes that I have at home by myself. I just started ordering my own drink like a couple months ago and even then sometimes it’s really hard for me and I feel like I want to cry. One time I tried to order myself a chocolate milk,(it was one of my first times trying to order for myself) I practiced it over and over again in my head and I felt confident that I could do this by myself, but when it was my turn to actually say it out loud I started crying and I felt so uncomfortable inside. I hate that I’m like this. I really really want to do things on my own but when I try I feel so bad and awkward inside(I don’t know how to describe it) and I cry. I think everyone hates me because of it, they tell me to grow up and they just don’t seem to understand how I feel even when I try to explain it to them. I know I need to grow up, I want to, but I don’t know how to."
1328,"Today's I've been living in a dream, and I want to go back.","I'm diagnosed with narcolepsy (pretty much excessive daytime sleepiness with/without cataplexy.)

I slept until 1pm today, and then took a nap from 3-5:30... because I couldn't NOT be asleep. 
My rooms a mess, I havent gotten anything productive done all day, and most importantly... I feel like a failure. I feel like I'm living a life that's not mine. Another common symptom of narcolepsy (that I have) is very vivid dreaming/hallucinations. Whenever I wake up, I have to fight to remember that it was only a dream and that I have an actual life of my own to live. I dont know what to do anymore... I dont have insurance, and no money to pay for an out of pocket doctors appointment. I'm starting a job soon, and I dont know what to do anymore."
1329,Would Hearing Other Peoples Stories Help You?,"Hey everyone!

I recently started a YouTube channel. This channel is aimed at destroying the Mental Health Stigma completely by encouraging people to talk about their struggles, and not being afraid to do so. This also empowers viewers watching.

What we do is provide the opportunity for anyone to Anonymously share their story to us. I will then personally read your story to the viewers and create your own unique video for you. This not only helps the writer of the story exercise their ability to speak about their problems, but it also helps the viewers out by relating to these stories, therefore no longer feeling alone to fight their battles. I'm creating a community and I want to support everyone in their fight against Mental Health.

I'm looking for feedback on this and want to know what you all think. Is this something that could really help you and most people struggling with mental health?

Please UP this post if you are supporting so others can view it. Thank you in advance."
1330,School work and exams have been making me feel like shit,"So to give some context I am from the UK and as some may know in the UK you do these big exams at 16 years old called GCSEs and I am currently in the run up to the exams, (it’s GCSE year for me) and everything about these exams has been making me feel pretty shit to put it bluntly.

I am currently on a “holiday” for one week, I put quotations because it really doesn’t feel like one because they have told us to revise 5 hrs a day and have also set lots of homework (bear in mind it is only one week) and honestly it feels like the worst holiday I have ever had. It isn’t even just the fact we are supposed to do the work because most people at least I don’t think are doing 5 hrs a day but I personally have not being doing enough revision and have to be quite honest got barely any done. Then after a couple days of unproductive revision I am already late into that week off (I missed like the first weekend because I went to see my grandparents+skipped Monday which added to it) and then I realise I have lots of homework to do and coursework (I do PE GCSE) so I have now decided to scrap the timetable and start doing my homework which is bad because I need to do revision too but I thought it would be better to do homework.

The whole thing has made me feel so terrible because the work/revision itself isn’t even the worst part but it’s my lack of doing that revision that has made me feel terrible because for some reason I just cannot get myself to work and I will get distracted or maybe I will get through one subject and then just decide I am too tired to do the other 3 hrs of revision I planned for that day. But then after saying I am to tired and giving up on it I feel even worse because I feel as if I am not doing the work I am supposed too and although I am meant to be relaxing I just feel shit and empty inside.

Not only this but I decide to start revision late in the day (when I probably should start earlier) but when I am not revising it isn’t really all that great either because all I end up doing is staying inside and playing video games. Then I eventually try to revise either procrastinate and get nothing done or only get one subject’s revision done then give up on the rest maybe because I am overwhelmed by the amount of hours I need to put in. 

Like I said earlier though the worst part is I am stuck in this state where I am meant to be relaxing and having fun (when I stop revising/give up on it) but I am still feeling shit thinking about how I have not being doing enough work and it is making me feel really sad and everything seems kinda just shit.

I currently feel terrible because of this revision and work issue of procrastination and not having fun, feeling sad about my lack of revision but also I think what’s making me feel even worse I am not exercising/playing sports enough and I am eating like shit and overall I think my mental health is not in a good place right know.

Any advice on how to help the situation would be greatly appreciated.

Side Note: I do have a past history of poor mental health and in the past have struggled with anxiety in particular and although I have seen therapists for that and it has got better I maybe more prone to feelings as I described due to my past mental health disorders."
1331,Need advice on if it is a good idea or not to continue watching a controversial streamer gamble.,"Hi guys, I wanted to post this here because I don't have any friends to talk to about it in real life and the advice I have received here has been good before.

Today I did some self-reflection on why I watch a twitch streamer spend thousands of dollars buying loot boxes AKA cases in the video game CSGO, which is essentially gambling, and realized I have been vicariously gambling through him.  I realized that I had a gambling problem when I remembered I bought a $10 bingo lotto ticket with my mom's credit card a few days ago.  I am 26 for context - jobless, and a college drop out.  I thought of the times when I saw escorts in the past, of the times I gambled on getting cards in a game called hearthstone, of all the times I overspent at the grocery store and at restaurants, of all the gas money I spent to drive to and purchase overpriced food in different cities, and all the money wasted on college which I couldn't even finish, which made me realize I really do have a gambling problem/using mom's money inappropriately.

I was addicted to seeing escorts up until a few months ago (I have since completely stopped), even going so far as to spend my own mother's hard-earned money as I myself was in debt.  It's not even like we're rich or anything - my own addiction resulted in hurting my mother behind her back.  This was extremely immoral of me to do.  I realized that at the core of this behaviour was gambling, since I was addicted to the surprise of whether I would emotionally and physically connect with the escort, experiences which are absent in my life because I am too insecure to start a relationship since I have no income, lost all my friends, don't have my own place, and I dropped out of college and feel like a failure.  Up until recently, even hugs from family members were a rarity, and I have felt like for a long time I wasn't being nurtured sufficiently emotionally and therefore I searched for these needs through escorts and food.

I don't know how to make it up to my mom.  I have been trying to at least keep the house clean for her, because that makes her happy.  We're hugging again, at least, which has done wonders for my mental health.  

I've already stopped complete seeing escorts and buying gas to travel to other cities outside my own is rare if not also completely stopped, but now I will stop buying unnecessary things like lotto tickets, restaurant food, and items obtained from gambling in video games.

Being jobless and not in school, and besides working on my mental health, I tend to spend many hours watching streamers on twitch (I watch people play video games mostly on the internet), but particularly a streamer who spends loads of money on gambling in video games, so I was wondering: Is continuing to watch this behaviour healthy or not?  On one hand, I think he's a funny guy and deep down a good person,  and I find his thoughts in general amusing, although I don't necessarily agree with them.  His foul language sometimes makes me not want to watch him as it can oftentimes make him seem mysoginistic and I do not want to associate myself with that image as it is doesn't represent me (I wouldn't even be able to defend him anyways as I am just one of many viewers who don't personally know him).  I watch him mostly because he makes me laugh because he's kinda bad at video games and opens cases during gameplay.  Sometimes he hosts podcasts with other streamers, and sometimes we watch Hell's Kitchen, which is a fun time, sometimes.

I am just worried that watching him gamble and associating myself with the image that others perceive him to be (mysoginistic, a gambling addict) is unhealthy for me mentally and socially.  Is it a red flag that I am even worried what other people think of me if they find out I watch his stream.   I don't know for sure if he is truly mysoginistic and I'd like to think not, but he says foul things like ""suck my c**k"" to both men and women frequently, which can be viewed in a negative way and I don't want to give people even more reason to see me in a negative way as I am not mysoginistic.  Honestly there are more entertaining streamers out there who I would rather watch, but he streams at a time where other big streamers are usually not streaming. Is continuing to watch this guy a good idea or not?"
1332,"my dad doesn’t love me, i’m mad at my siblings, and i need to vent","i was the second of five children. my dad doesn’t have one picture of me up on any of his social media accounts, whereas he has many photos of my siblings. there are even pictures which he cut me out of in order to post. i was the only one he didn’t get a christmas present for this year. i know i shouldn’t hold this to my siblings, but i do. i hate them because he loves them more than me and it’s obvious. when i opened up to him about being assaulted, he didn’t care. there has been times where he’s ignored me for days at a time. i want to feel loved, i want to be cared about. i want my dad to hold my in his arms and tell me he loves me."
1333,I’m having really bad mood swings depression and anxiety,I’m on the verge of having a panic attack I’m afraid to drive and leave my house I’m depressed. I think I might be crazy
1334,Could I be depressed?,"I just feel bad all the time. I just sit in my room with the lights off playing games I don't even enjoy anymore. I just do it to try and stop myself from thinking about the feeling slowly gnawing at me. I still have moments of happiness but the moment they end, I look back at and tell myself ""You should've held on to it longer""."
1335,Workplace advice,"Need advice about ADA situation at work

Hi guys! I work as a parts advisor at a motorcycle dealership and I have recently had to file for accommodations due to my disorder. My doc recommended that I take on a modified schedule or have less customer interaction. I submitted this to my boss but feel like he is mad at me about it. He is a little cold and it really plays into my paranoia. I currently feel like I am going to get fired and that everyone at work hates me because I’ve missed 6 or 7 times over a 3 month period. Any advice on how to train myself to stay positive and look at this positively? I get stuck in negative self talk a lot. I have a lot of shame regarding my disorder(Schizoaffective bipolar type) All help would be greatly appreciated"
1336,Does anyone else sometimes convince themselves that they're faking it for attention?,"Like, 80-90% of the time, I know I'm not. But every once in a while, I will see someone post about people who fake it for attention, and I just spend hours convincing myself that I don't actually have any problems and that it's my fault I can't have a normal life."
1337,How to help my boyfriend,"My boyfriend shut me out completely for 3 days and today he finally confronted me and said that he feels like he doesn’t want to be here anymore and has met with a counselor at his college twice now. What is the best thing for me to do in this situation? 
I want to be there for him but he’s just someone who is hard to be there for. No matter what you do it’s not the right thing or the best thing. I constantly feel like I’m walking on eggshells as it is so now it’s extra tense. 
I just feel so stuck. Our relationship has had a lot of issues and i am ready for it to end but i can’t just walk away from him when he’s dealing with this. 
What do i do?"
1338,Today was a bad day,"Its been one of the darkest days Ive had in years. Im right on the cusp of losing everything, and Im afraid to move. It might already be too late to fix the things my poor mental health has messed up. My marriage, my family, my life. All because Ive let the darkness control me and wrap around with an iron grip. 

Today broke me. Ive been crying for hours and I cant stop. Fear is gnawing at me like a rabid animal. My anxiety keeps reminding me that I have never been completely on my own before. My depression keeps telling me this is all my fault. If only I had done more laundry. If only I hadnt lived like a slob for all those years. If only I could stop those behaviors. If only...

I dont have any friends that are local, no family close enough to help. And if they were, theyre just as broke as me and couldnt help anyways. 

I keep falling into the darkness. Nothing sounds good. Not food or sleep or anything that might make me feel better. I just lay on the couch and cry as I hold my dog. The fear is crippling. I feel like im drowning, and theres nothing to grab onto. Nothing to help pull me out of this pit. 

I guess if youve read this far, youd like something to take away from this. I only really have one piece of advice. Save youraelf while you still have a chance to. Go get that extra help. Ignore whatever anyone else says and you do you. Maybe sit back and enjoy how good you have it (if you have it good right now, that is) and hug your family extra tight for me."
1339,"I want to deal with my mental health issues privately, but I don't think that's possible in college.","In short, I want to get help privately, without exciting my parents. They'll just tell the rest of my family that I'm not 100% with it mentally and everybody'll judge me.

In high school, my plan was to just wait until I turned 18 to get help as an adult somehow. I don't think was well-thought out...

Well, now I'm in college, and the mental health services are supposed to be better than other school's, but the thing is I'm on my parent's insurance. Even if I could get therapy there, my parents would be told by the insurance company since I think they require insurance (they said they do a free couple of sessions, but they might still ask for insurance?).

So, now I look until past college, when I'm on my own health plan. That would suck. I'm not even halfway through college yet and I haven't enjoyed it as much as I could."
1340,I’m... sad?,"Sooo, I’m young. Like 18 minus six young (I don’t want to type my actual age unless I get flagged) and I have had some suicidal thoughts. I always have to pretend I’m happy, because my parents are at the edge of a divorce, and my sister (my twin) really just doesn’t care. I always have to be the upbeat one, excited and distracting my parents from the real problem, there impending divorce. My sister calls me fat all the time, which wouldn’t really matter if it weren’t semi true. I try and try to keep being happy, but it’s just so hard, because I really don’t know what to do. Some people might say, “you’re to young, you should be happy” and yeah, I should, but it’s just so hard. I really don’t know what to do."
1341,Do I have some sort PTSD?,"First off, I'm not trying to offend anyone who has experienced much worse than me, nor trying to diagnose myself.
Anyway so when I [14F] was 12, my dad... Well he used to go up behind my mom and grope her chest. And my mother and I have a similar body type, and that day I happened to be wearing a more traditional type of clothing, a style that my mom wore. That feeling of being trapped... If course he stopped and apologised vehemently as soon as he noticed it was me. My mom knows and stuff and I don't blame him; I know it was an accident and that he would never have done it had he had known that it was me.
So I noticed I have a really bad reaction to men or even just boys in general, just standing close to me. Or even talking to them I stutter and if a man shouts I freak out, shaking and hiding someone, panicky and sorta hyperventilating.
I know that the incident pales in comparison to people I know have suffered more drastic abuse, but do you think it's affected me long term? Or is it just general meekness/shyness? I mean tbh my dad shouts a lot and is quite violent /fanatical (even tho he isn't abusive) and that might come into play?? I just feel like this specific incident is a contributing factor. Or maybe I'm just making excuses idk🤷🏽‍♀️"
1342,My mind feels like it’s trying to leave,"-Another stream of consciousness/poem-

Frantic
Busy making 
Visibly shaking
Focus not there
Can’t focus anywhere
Scroll
Can’t stop
Feel like I’m going to pop
Pop the champagne, drink some wine
Take a deep breath 
How to pass the time
Wait it out  Wade it out
Anxiety like molasses 
My hearts beating so fast and
What next
Who do I text
Who is awake
How do I stop this quake 
Do I sleep? 
Do I sit?
Watch tv and try to resist
I can’t focus
I can’t breathe 
My mind feels like it’s trying to leave
And my body won’t let it
Got a vice grip
Saying “No you have to stay
You made your bed now lay in it”

All I can do is pray
cross my fingers
Hope to god 
This isn’t my new reality
It will pass soon and leave me
When 
How soon
Let me go
I need to move
But everything’s moving so slow
Every step I take is one too many 
I feel like I’m going to fall
My movements so big but in reality so small
A step is five
One step too many is a dive
Into the unknown 
Because what happens when you outstrip you’re surroundings
You’re moving light speed trying to catch up
But to what
And meanwhile your surroundings are at a snails pace 
This isn’t a race
This is leaving behind
Your groundings 
Your surroundings 

My heart is still skipping
Every beat my minds moving
My teeth are clenched
Feel cemented together 
Wrench them apart 
To swallow the liquor 
Write it all out
And don’t let it linger
Expel it from your mind 
To keep it in is unkind"
1343,What to expect on a therapy intake session?,I am starting therapy for the first time next week. What should I expect from the initial intake session? Is there anything I should do before to prepare? I am pretty nervous.
1344,Advice for someone with possible Dependent Personality Disorder?,"I was just doing some reading on how to stop depending on other people for happiness and I ran into this article on something called Dependent Personality Disorder. It described having a fear of having to take care of yourself, and basically depending on other people for everything. It sounded almost exactly like me. Often times I find myself depending on other people for a lot of things. Happiness being probably the biggest one. Another aspect of it was avoiding confrontation out of fear of losing someone you depend on and I related to that as well. So how can I fix this? I don’t want to rely on anyone else to live my life. I am currently seeing a therapist and plan to bring it up in the next session but is there anyone on this sub who knows about this sort of thing? What are some things I can do on my own to get better?"
1345,resurfaced memories and progress,"i was watching a movie and a girl stepped in a puddle which reminded me of something i used to do. i had OC tendencies when i was in middle school and am now much better after therapy (currently in uni) but some thoughts still spring up. i used to walk outside a lot to meet with friends in town and i walked home from school. if i was ever having one of my bad days or i was upset, i’d purposely step in puddles because i thought i deserved it. it’d wet my whole shoe and soak my sock and i would squeak the rest of the way home and it’d be miserable and unclean and gross. i haven’t felt the urge to do that in a while and i kind of forgot that i even did it in the first place. it makes me proud of my progress. i’ve been working on positive self-talk and this feels like a super clear sign that i’m getting better with my relationship with myself. go me :)"
1346,Best i’ve ever felt but feels like mania,"I’ve been a depressive my entire life. I never felt joy in anything but could always put a good fake around people. This summer was the lowest I’ve ever been: moldy food in my room, bills not paid, rent always late, drinking on my drive to work, the works. I ended up having to move home for obvious reasons. In October I was offered a job in my field, doing exactly what I want to do(not my dream job but its exactly what I need to do in order to get my dream job), i’m being paid a very good salary for my location and experience level, it’s in the city I want to be, I could go on forever about how perfect my life is right now. One thing I need to add is that I started taking concerta in September. Having concerta and money is making me feel so fucking happy that it feels like i’m manic. I’ve never been a confident or stuck up person but I can’t help but notice that I make more money than most people in the room that i’m in. I’ve never had a date before and I have two in the next two weeks. I started going to the gym 6 days a week and have seen the beginnings of a 6pack for the first time in my entire life. I feel absolutely limitless, and I don’t want it to change but knowing how life goes there is going to be a dramatic fall in the future and that has been scaring me. I also feel like this isn’t sustainable, I mean every day on my drive to work I think about all of the things that I don’t have and make a plan to do it because I know I can. I have the money, drive, and now confidence I can do it. Fuck man, I love this feeling but I also don’t because i’m not content with anything. I always need more now, nothing is enough."
1347,What do I do about my mother?,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I need the opinions of others. Recently I learned my mother doesn’t just imagine things in her minds eye but she physically sees them in the real world. My mother has always been quirky to the point of me worrying about her mental health, her mind works so differently that sometimes the things she thinks just don’t make sense. But this time I really don’t know what to make of it, she seems to think being able to see the things you imagine manifest in the real world is normal. What disorder is this? Is this normal and somehow I didn’t know about it? Should I be concerned or just let it slide? I really don’t know what to do and would appreciate any insight."

1351,Overly empathic?,"I'm not very sure how to define this other than overly empathic. It seems like I'm always consumed by others emotion rather than myself. I hear a sad story and feel really really sad to the point it hurts my entire being, but I can't get happy myself. Hell, I can't really be sad myself. Its hard to actually offend me, to hurt me, since I am feeling what you are rather than what you're throwing. even if I talk to people when I'm sad, generally I just end up even more sad and they just get sad too. Am I just over thinking this or something?"
1352,Any ideas on what might me going on?,"I don’t need any definitive answer or reason but if anyone could give me some ideas that would be really great! 
I’m a 15 year old girl who has had depression and anxiety and an eating disorder with bulimia for a LONG time. Recently I have had very vivid images pop into my head randomly. The first time I experienced this was a couple weeks ago and it was as if watching a movie of someone overdose except it was me. I could vividly imagine me shaking opening up the bottle, dumping the pills into my hand, shoving them down my throat and me falling to the ground then dying. I went and told my mom because I was scared and felt that telling her might stop me from actually doing it. Oh also, it felt like as if there’s this thing attached to me sending me signals, not exactly speaking to me, but sending me brain waves of these ideas. I then went into the kitchen to take my night time cold pills because I was sick. I then went and looked up common pills to od on and apparently you need 3000mg of acetaminophen to cause some harm to your body. I then looked at the pills and saw that it contained 325mg of acetaminophen and my body went cold and this feeling told me that I could take 15 to do some real harm. ( once again, not a verbal voice but as if it’s a brain wave sending me that stuff) I then started thrashing around trying to get whatever was sending me the messages to leave. It kinda feels like that meme of the nervous system all laid out on the table was attached to the back of me sending those waves to me and I wanted it off of me. I knew that there was nothing attached to me it just felt like something was inside of me doing something. I also recently started cutting(we’re all good now) and it felt like there was something telling me where to cut and how to. I cut before and felt a sense of freedom afterwards but this time I felt worse. Like a friend just roped me into doing something wrong. Sometimes the messages aren’t bad. I’m a dancer so I’m flexible but sometimes I’ll get the message sent to me to go do a summersault in the middle of class, go lay on the floor, lift my food above me... stuff like that. Harmless, but not me telling myself to do that. If anyone has any ideas or experiences like mine that would be great!"
1353,"Welp, I did it ...","I told my primary doc about my episodes, and now I am waiting on a psychiatrist referral from a coordination group. They reached out today, and I answered their assessment questions. In a way, I am relieved,  and yet,  my answers to the questions disturbed me drastically. Most of the negative feelings based questions, I answered with between several days to most days over the past 30 days."
1354,"How to figure out that I need help?I mean,I don't understand.I feel horrible and I can name things what make me uncomfortable etc.But at the same time I feel just nothing.and when I feel that way ,I just think that all this was nothing,like a dream,blurry,foggy...",And i dont sleep again
1355,I lied to my therapist.,She asked me if I had a plan to end my life. I said no because I’m scared to be taken to the hospital. I feel incredibly guilty and not safe. I have an appointment with her next week and need help being honest.
1356,I am so fucking hopeless,"I've tried everything I can do in my life, I can't make new friends, and I can't get out of the hole that I am in. I would get therapy but it's too expensive, even under insurance. The only people I have in my life are too fucking stupid to understand my problems. On top of that I don't believe that working a full time 5 days a week is how I want to live my life. Work just gives me anxiety that I never ever have felt in my whole life. And when I tried to get medication for it, they charged me 300 dollars. I don't ever believe their is a solution to my mental dilemma. There is no solo activity in this world that makes me happy, I **only** find happiness in trying to make others happy. All that gets me is nowhere. If you're going to try to say something like: ""just find something that makes you happy,"" first of all, thanks for trying, but all I do is try new things, and I'm sick of it. There is a void in my life that only gets temporarily patched in the presence of others.  

I'm usually a pretty big optimist but fuck man, this shit is so FUCKING painful. Life is shit for me and I seriously just want to end it all."
1357,THC induced psychosis?,"Let me preface this by saying I am not looking for medical advice. I have full intent on seeing a professional once I am in a position I feel appropriate. I am not mentally unstable in my day to day life and work a 40+ hour/week construction job for the last 1.5 years or so with no issues. Aside from these experiences I mention below I have never once experienced any other mental health issues in my life. I’m mainly just looking to hear if others have had similar experiences, and there outcomes. I also would like to use this as a place to somewhat vent as I haven’t really told anyone about this aside from my roommate. 

Hello, 

My first occurrence of this issue was about 1.5-2 a years ago. I was 20-21 years old at the time. I was in a position where I only had to work ~1 week out of the month every month and was using highly concentrated amounts of THC from the second I woke up until I went to sleep every single day for months on end. I also was not keeping a steady sleep schedule at this time. I had always been a big proponent of THC and was a firm believer in there being no draw backs to the drug. While I was on this THC binge some very odd things started to happen. It’s important to note 80% of my time during this period was spent playing some online games and only leaving my house when necessary. The first side effects I noticed were I would hear what I thought were people speaking outside my room. This speaking would scare me but I wouldn’t know why, for all I knew it was people downstairs but I would quickly realize something odd was going on because it didn’t matter where in my room I would be, or even if I plugged my ears, it would continue. The stuff I would hear would be inaudible nothing that I could translate to English but in a weird way I had an idea of what was being said and a lot of times it would make me laugh. It usually sounded like multiple voices speaking at once but would vary. When I would come to grips with what was happening I would get very scared and usually resort to getting higher. This went on for about a month before I made a big change in my life and stopped THC for a long period of time ~6 months. 

I never really told anyone about this and when I quit using THC the side effects ended immediately and never returned. Over the last 6-9 months I slowly dug myself back into that hole. I started with smoking weed casually, and eventually ended up doing dabs every day for the past ~6 months and as of the last 4-6 weeks started experiencing those same side effects except slightly more pronounced this time around. I would “catch” myself doing absolutely insane things like standing by my bed and telling my wall “you can’t say that” and just laughing or find myself having a full conversation and replying to nothing, I’d catch myself just standing around my room in the dark at random times. I don’t even know how often this happened because these were just times I can remember catching myself doing this. My mind has been in a fog these last 6 months and I’m finally coming to grips with this issue. I’ve talked to my roommate about it and I am going on my 3rd day cold turkey from THC, nicotine, caffeine. I have been avoiding admitting this for a very long time but I have a self control issue, a substance abuse issue, and possibly a mental health issue. One reason I bring this up is because of the last point in particular. Although I abused THC to a pretty high extreme I know there are people out there living normal lives abusing THC just as hard if not harder than I was with no mental health issues like I had. I know this because I have plenty of friends that are extreme THC users and they also live normal lives yet face no mental health issues? 

Has anyone experienced similar issues while using THC? Could this be a sign that I am prone to being schizo? About 2 weeks ago while I was at what I would consider my “rock bottom” I googled what was happening and that led to me googling schizophrenia side effects and realized I was almost reading a description of myself at that point in time. I started taking the THC use easier after a really bad scare about 1-2 weeks ago and have fully quit everything going on my 3rd day tomorrow. I feel very odd rite now but my mind has calmed down a lot these last 3 days. I have not heard anything or had a weird experience since I toned down the amount I was smoking about a week ago. At this point I have no intention on every returning to THC usage. I want to focus on myself and my mind. I used to meditate regularly and am picking it up again. I’ve been in a hole for a while now and haven’t been man enough to admit it. Everyone always talks about how safe THC is I never wanted to seem like the weak one out who couldn’t handle his own, but at this point I partly wish I never touched the stuff in the first place."

1359,"Rant about landlord, apartment, mental health and OCD","I've moved into an antique apartment in July. The building was bought one month after I signed the lease. I had some issues with the landlord since then. She owns a beauty studio in the building, renovated the whole commercial floor and has one small commercial space to rent. There's two apartments in basement, and two upstairs. 

Her dad do renovations and work every day from 7-10am and early afternoon. I can't sleep during morning since October due to it even though I've been on a sick leave due to mental illness and I've been trying out many medications and I can't get my sleep straight. 

The landlord tried to remove my parking which was on the lease because I had no car. I argued with her, and kept it. Later on, when I moved out, she threatened to remove it because my mom parked on the parking next to mine because mine was taken by one of her customer. Then she tried to make me give up on it by giving me 40$ per month and renting it for 80$ a month to someone else. My ex told her my parking is always taken by her clients and faced her about it, and she went nuts and said she'd reassign me a place elsewhere. 

My two declawed, neutered and elderly cats are on my lease. She owns a chihuahua and hates cats generally. She had to double-check if it was allowed because she didn't want to allow them in, and kept complaining about the litterbox even though it's a huge box closed with a flap and with magic blue cartridges, litter maid powder, with one lavender pot next to it, with one automatic air freshener in the area set at the max level. I scoop it daily and wash it entirely regularly with hot water and soap, and it was a new box I bought when I moved in July. She said my neighbor was complaining as well, I talked to her about it and she said she never said anything about it and she had her own complains as well about the new landlord (too cold in her place, she had her coat, scarf and gloves on) . 

She was on my case because of my cat fur outside my apartment on the carpet and the carpeted staircase. I agreed to vacuum it after switching to a better vacuuming appliance that could do the work on the sticky carpet. 

Here are the issues of the place :

- big gaps between floor and wall : I lost a pencil once there.
- big gaps under doorframes
- balcony is rotten, had a wasp nest under the planks, landlord knew before we even moved in, didn't do anything. 
- roof which is part of the building and which host another retail store is full of lichen, vegetation, moss and is about to collapse. My dad told the landlord dad, and it isn't a priority. 
- floor is uneven : had to reorganize rooms several times because my tv was half in the air, my computer chair would roll down, my bed was giving me back aches due to being not straight enough, had to put wood pieces under some sides of furniture to prevent them from falling in one direction or the other so I finally straightened my environment out) 
- cracks in upper part of wall that worsen up : landlord father said it's useless to fix them since they'll just appear again and it's the weight of the snow on the flat roof
- cedar closet but part of the wood is removed and I didn't notice it without using a flashlight so I see the in-between wall and the floor/wall have a gap again... 
- holes in wall left by previous tenants weren't fixed and they say I entered too quick for them to do it but won't do it anyway so I hide them with posters 
- electrical switches are visible on kitchen wall so I have to hide them with a poster
- entrance door don't close properly, always have to lock it or it opens up and it shows the hallway light around it... Also no fish eye
- hole in wood door of a room left by previous tenant when moving out
- wood filler keep coming out of the floor and it leaves 0.4 inches spaces
- water radiators pipes in the floor weren't sealed so landlord dad filled them with transparent caulk, also did it for one gap between floor and wall, and landlord was mad because she thought it was me who did it
- had moisture on bathroom windows with chopped paint and etc due to normal paint used for the bathroom window, landlord dad put transparent caulk on the window frame directly to compensate for the improper paint...
- windows (new!!!) were coming out from their frames, we had to hammer them back in place, and landlord dad put some gaulk to fill the holes...
- kitchen counter is stained permanently, silverfishes live there, I asked for caulking the kitchen between wall and counter, they always forget about it.
- water pipes of sink in both bathroom and kitchen are open wide
- had to wait for 8 months to get a exhausted fan grill and he forgot he had it for a month so I wasn't cooking anything greasy
- floor in kitchen have HUGE GAPS and floor is black in the gaps, some planks are moving and the varnish is mostly gone everywhere
- plank is rotten and full of dead carpet beetle larvae in the second room, landlord put boric acid and put back my tape on it.
- most doors don't close. I had to put a screw for the closet door to close in my bedroom chamber and some don't close or can be closed by ""stucking them"" in the door frame (can't be closed entirely, but are stuck when trying to, so yay?)
- hot water runs out often. For some weeks in January, I only had lightly warm water no matter when. I've been accused of using it with hot wash due to the larvae infestation but my machine washer is disabled for hot water, so it wasn't me, but landlord dad said they adjusted the water to a lower setting and it goes crazy at times? 
- water heater stopped working for hours twice 
- tenants have no control over temperature since it's a furnace and water heating. It was very cold (19 degrees Celsius) and even colder in my neighbor place, place doesn't keep its warmth and landlord is upset about rising the temperature. Two of my water radiators weren't working for months, and experts they hired found out they were closed (they're locked so I had no way of adjusting them). I kept telling them and they wouldn't believe me, and said it was totally normal.
- I had an open venting hole in my celling full of dust and icky things, tried to clean it up with not luck. Landlord dad finally closed it with aluminium tape after the carpet bettle larvae infestation. 
- had an open hole in my wall of an old phone system. They closed it with aluminium paper recently due to the infestation. 
- I asked for some electric plugs to be replaced and they refused because ""they still work"". They're either very used, do blue sparks, too deep, etc. Some of my outlets aren't grounded apparently as well. 
- they refused to fill my hallway floor-wall and tell me to vacuum every gap with my vacuum tool and to do every floor crack. Who has 2 hours per day to vacuum its entire place, seriously???


I have a recent bug issue. I had lots of bettle carpet larvae on my hallway carpet, laundry basket, under my nightstand where a cat toy was lost, on a pompon ball in one of my cedar closet, under my duvet cover bag in my wardrobe (nothing else is on the floor but a plastic box), in my cat bed in a basket, in my slippers, boots, shoes and under my leather cube in my living room. Everything above ground seems to be safe. 

I threw everything out. I bathed my long-haired cat, he was the one who had a larvae stuck on his fluffy tail else I would never have noticed the larvae. I brush my cats everyday since then, my female kitty lost a patch of fur due of the stress of having all her toys and spots thrown out and seeing me vacuum twice or thrice a day. I even emptied my new leather couch of all the synthetic blankets on it, steam washed my box spring and mattress (nothing was found there, so ground is larval!!!) and cleaned everything compulsively for days.

Every time I vacuum, there's dead bettle carpet larvae coming up, and everywhere. I notice there's a pattern with the previous tenants furnitures, the larvae show up where their carpets were placed, or upholstery couch, bed, clothes on back of a chair and touching the ground... The one who was in the room with the rotten plank and dead larvae complained that the washing machine included in the apartment was putting holes in her clothes but it never happened to me ever once. I realize maybe they didn't notice the larvae since they said they never saw anything to the landlord.

My cat food is stored in a sealed plastic box, nothing there. Their two feeding machines are automatic and food is sealed as well (one comes out at precise time, high bowl and food access is on top and no scent comes out from it, other one is a SureFeed feeder that works with my cat microchip). No living larvae there, only the army of the dead spot. Nothing where their water is as well. I put plastic mat for them under their feeding and water area. Nothing under it.

I am currently recovering from mental illness and it got my OCD full-blown. I keep organizing, checking, buying plastic boxes, even was going to buy a new bed until we checked it properly, I'm scared of my wardrobe clothes, I have bought a huge plastic box to transfer my clothes in it, lots of cedar balls objects shoes filler blocks etc, spent 45$ on cedar oil to dilute it to spray it everywhere, put insecticide on my couch and in my upholstery Secret Lab dva chair, vacuum everything compulsively,

I haven't done anything for a week but stress, clean, check, and I sleep very badly, feeling like bugs are crawling on me. Even had the impression of having one in my ear or on my scalp. Even when I try to sit down, I keep checking, just to be sure. And even if I vacuum like crazy, I find new dead larvae everyday in the cracks.

My landlord called a exterminator company and they came when I was out shopping for plastic boxes, the guy apparently said it was a common pest and I probably handled it quickly enough so the place is safe -- even if there are shedding skins or dead bugs in the wood floor cracks... Landlord brought boric acid and sprayed it on the crack with the dead larvae, and in the crack between the floor and wall in the hallway, and around some doorcases. She gave me a can of insecticide to use on the floor cracks, and to swipe off the excess.  But the whole floor is full of cracks so it took me a lot of time to just do it. They'll try to access the attic because apparently they have to use boric acid there since it seems to be there. But they're doing intense renovations since October downstairs and I'm afraid it might give me more pests upstairs, especially when the previous store was a wool and fabric one.

I was about to fill the gaps in the wood floor myself, I stopped and asked my landlord if she'd fix them now. She refused, said it gave it an antique look and it's clean and not a problem, and to stop obsessing about it (note that I'm a very clean person, so they didn't pin the fault on me for the infestation since I take care of the place very well even if I'm very depressed. But the landlord said at first it was probably a cat bug and was complaining about letting them in).

The wood is creaky, very uneven, some spots are darkened by rot, gaps are very big, some holes are very deep and can't be vacuumed out entirely, etc. She refused to fix the rotting places or the rotting plank where the army of the dead are staying. Or no varnish on many places of the wood flooring, so the wood isn't protected at all. 

She says people dig this look. I can't fucking keep it clean and I keep finding more bugs. I'm at my wits ends. I called a city inspector to check if everything is according to norms, else I'm sending her a letter to ask her to either do the fixing (walls and huge floor gaps) or to reduce my rent, else I'll have to pursue her. I'm exhausted and kinda tired of it, but I've been spending so many bucks that I don't have to fix this mess and I can't sleep properly nor even walk on my floor without being scared of having an unseen egg stuck to my feet, or picking up my cat without checking if he has a larvae on him.

Is this situation normal? I signed back the lease for another year before the whole thing happened because I struggle to keep my mental health going and I've been moving out thrice in three years (after breakup, then living alone in a big building with too many theft, drugs and violence issues, then moved out with a flatmate who had romantic expectations, and now here on my own), and I needed a break from stress but now I really want to give up..."
1360,Hospitalization Help,"Does anyone mind sharing their experiences with inpatient or outpatient/partial hospitalization programs? I’ve been struggling with ptsd symptoms and suicidal ideation, and I feel like at this point I need more assistance than can be provided by basic once a week therapy, but I also worry I’m not in bad enough shape to warrant such intense intervention? But I also know isolating myself and wishing I was dead is not normal or okay. Idk, I’m rambling a bit, just any personal experiences anyone is willing to share would be appreciated"
1361,I keep thinking about stealing my grandfather's pain meds.,I have debilitating pain the catch I'm 16 so no doctor will treat my pain.  I'm just gonna have to suffer till someone takes me seriously. I go to my grandmother's every Wednesday so I'm not alone and all I can think about is taking some of my grandfather's pain meds. I want to know what not  being  in 6-10 pain is. I want to feel like a normal teenager. I want to go back to the top high school in my state and learn everything. But most of all I want to be a dermatologist I rather kill myself than not accomplish my goals.
1362,My brain is angry,"I don’t know how else to describe it. It’s grouchy and uncomfortable. It’s angry at me for having the lights on, breathing too loudly, or focusing too hard on trying to sleep."
1363,Why do I not feel present in my day to day life?,"When I [22M] was a teenager I used to pride myself on my ability to be situationally aware, feel in control and otherwise feel like I’m operating at 100%. In recent years things have changed. At times I feel like I’m watching my life go by as if it’s a movie. Like I’m not in control of my actions but rather watching myself go through the motions. I’m getting clumsy, I’m always bumping into things, dropping things, knocking stuff over without meaning to. I zone out constantly. My memory has gotten so bad sometimes I can’t even remember what I ate for lunch that day. I’m barely attentive, I can’t seem to focus on anything for even short periods of time. I feel like I’m losing control and I don’t feel present in my own head. I feel like I used to operate at 100% but now I only feel like I’m operating at 5%. Idk why this is happening to me, and I have no clue on how to conquer my mind again. Does anyone know anything about this? Is this normal?"
1364,Low libido,"I'm frustrated. I (22F) have always had a pretty normal sex drive, but for the past year or so since I've been on and off meds for bipolar, I've struggled with low libido. Like I just about don't want to do anything. I can barely stand being touched anywhere sexual and the thought of touching someone else sexually makes me super uncomfortable. This is unfortunate for my boyfriend (22M) who has a fairly high sex drive. We've been dating for 3.5 years so he's seen my descent into not wanting to do anything and I can tell he's pretty fed up. He tries to be patient but when he's in the mood he can get very frustrated and whiny that he's not getting any. Sometimes he even gets mad. I feel awful for not wanting to help him out and then I usually end up doing it anyway because I feel guilty for not satisfying his needs and then I end up feeling really gross and, in the most recent instance, crying in the shower for an hour.

I get that this is hard for him, but it just sucks. 

I'm tired."
1365,I don’t know what’s wrong?,"So I messed up, I think. I’ve been on and off depressed my whole life, gone through suicidal episodes and self harmed on and off for as long as I can remember. I had been doing really well throughout my senior year of high school, but as soon as I came to college, my mental health has just been declining faster and faster. I’ve been incredibly depressed and had lots of suicidal thoughts/intents. I went to therapy, but it just isn’t for me. He tried to tell me I was suffering the effects of childhood trauma but that didn’t feel right, so I stopped going. Now, I get drunk or high regularly and every time I do I end up in some sort of situation where I try to hurt/kill my self. Luckily, I have a significant other that’s been there to help me and stop me from doing it, but I feel like it’s so taxing on them. It makes me want to completely ghost them because I feel like I’m more of a burden to them than I’m worth. I think I really hurt them specifically last night, because I was extremely irritable (wasn’t being very nice) and I wanted to off myself and was frustrated that they wouldn’t leave. Internally, I wanted so badly to just apologize and hug them and tell them I love them and I’m sorry, I wanted to just be better for them, but I couldn’t. Worst part is they had an exam in the morning. Now they won’t text me back (completely understandably) and I’m afraid. After so many weeks of wanting to ghost them so they wouldn’t have to deal with me, I think they finally might be gone and Im realizing that’s not what I wanted at all. I am sad all of the time, don’t want to get out of bed or go to class/activities, but I can’t figure out what’s actually wrong. What am I supposed to do with myself? How can I fix this and get out of this rut? What actually works???"
1366,Is it possible to get out of what ever is wrong with me?,
1367,I believe I have a separate sadistic personality,"Ok some context since I was young [M17] I have struggled with extreme bouts of violent anger stemming from my dad going to jail and being bullied and isolated from those of my age at the time. The problem is I would black out everytime during these episodes, only able to remember bits and pieces as well as from what witnesses told me. Not only was I told/remember that I seemed to enjoy myself when I was violent towards others like when I would hurt them and such but I recall feeling I don't know joy out of it? That being said in my normal life I while struggle with anger issues am not a super violent person just stressed. I am ashamed of those feelings of sadistic anger. It's not me. The best way I've described it to a select few is that simply when I have an episode like that it is really not me, it's like watching something take control while I'm a long for the awful ride.

I should also mention I have not had an episode in years as I have a much much more strong control over it, but there are times where I catch my thoughts and feelings stemming from those episodes.

I'm unsure of if this is even a mental illness or something but this seemed the best place to post about it. Any advice would be most helpful as I have been think much about it lately."
1368,I've given up.,"I'm done with life.

Nobody really wants to be around me. I see that now. 
Yesterday I turned 16. I'm such a failure I didn't last a single day into the new year without cutting myself.

I can't talk to anyone about anything. I don't trust anyone after my dad nearly threw me in a psych ward after I told him about what goes on inside my head.

My parents never schedule appointments to go to a psychologist. The voices get louder and no matter how much pain I subject myself to it's not working and I don't know how to make the voices stop.

It's been like this since I was 5. I just want to be ok. For what's left of my childhood. 

I've tried the hotline and for the 3 times I called on seperate occasions I was on hold for over an hour before I hung up and just cut myself because that helped more than they ever could at this point.

Not even the suicide hotline people want to deal with me I guess.

I'm guessing this will be my last Reddit post. To the guy who sits next to me in history who also is a Reddit geek sees this - if I'm not at school on Monday you know what's happened."
1369,Inaudible Voices,"What's up yall! So a little background on me. 22 year old, dealt/dealing with suicidal and depressive thoughts, also in the closet about being gay. I'm on medicine now, Zoloft. I think it's working, as I dont have the thoughts often. But down to another problem...

I hear voices, no not audible actual voices, but they're in my head. I guess almost like a conscience. However, there's like three of them. One criticizes everything I do, one is just angry and rageful, and one tries to guide me, and the other comes in randomly whenever I do something I know is wrong (ie. Anything homosexual, I know people will say it's nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't feel like it). The voices are like loud in my head, and argue with me sometimes. I find myself even talking with them sometimes too, like legit one could ask a question and I could give an answer, or vice versa. I'm just not sure if this is purely my conscience or what. It's weird to explain, and honestly I feel crazy bringing it up, but any help anyone?"
1370,GF in hospital. I’m the only one she trusts.,"I am in over my head. My partner / gf had a ‘psychotic break’ I believe. I’ve been very poorly educated on mental health until a few nights ago. A few weeks ago she started going on about what can be best described as a conspiracy about her, related to sex and politics which was plausible but unlikely. 

I didn’t think much of it, I say yes, she must know, she’s smart. Even if I didn’t believe her I’m not going to deny men come onto her and like most women she has had unpleasant encounters. Anyway, couple days ago she calls and says she knows. She’s convinced I’m involved in this conspiracy. She breaks up with me we fight and I block her after an hour and a half of trying to explain how it’s impossible. 

Anyway, her family takes her to the hospital that night. I wake up the next day and I get a message to call the family. So I do and I get yelled at and they leave me hanging with a “she’s in the hospital” So I give them my keys to her apartment and everything they ask. They’re still apprehensive of me because I’m her weird younger bf of 6 months. Fair. But after getting terrorized by one family member from the start and saying I took advantage of her and that I am mentally ill myself, they said I could message her. I texted her and she’s scared of her doctor, she’s mad at her family for calling her crazy. And she apologized for everything she did to me, and admitted she was confused and didn’t mean it. She also says I’m the one she trusts, the only one who doesn’t call her crazy. I tried to tell her to listen to the doctor but she wasn’t having it. When I was talking to her I just said neutral stuff like “ I understand” and “that would make me feel bad too” 

I want to tell her doctor because I don’t want her to get further damaged by me not knowing what I’m doing if she’s delusional or something worse. I feel like I’m crossing the line with the family if I offer the doctor my insight, recollections, and the trust she puts in me. I have 0 experience with this outside of recently watched Ted Talks but I’d do anything to help her. Anyway I think I just wanted to type some of this out. I’m not doing this because of my dick, I want to marry her but if I gotta go then I’ll do that too. There’s a lot not on here but I have to sleep"
1371,Planning to be admitted to a psych ward,Any advice?
1372,I'm a legendary Warrior,"Going on about my delusions of granduer and impressions.  All this religious and spiritual things can complicate your work, and life.  People are constantly probing my mind and psyche.  What were my spiritual and religious beliefs, my impressions and reasons?  Like the military, folks wanting me to tell them about their kids and shit.  I'm not responsible for their fates or destiny's.  They're liberated folks here in much of the world now and responsble for themselves.  We don't have a conscription or slave military anymore, amen.  That's more than I can ask for is to be free of hackin up slaves, may take some pleasure in the battle, eh.  Hacking up these god damn slaves wears on my conscience at times.
Now we can get some proper Krieg Spiel's in without the thought of whether or not that person was obligated or obliged to be battlin me?  It's this modern sense of morality and right and wrong shit I have, as if I would give a damn when it was time to render steel through a mother fucker.
I was talking about chivalry, rules of engagement, sanctions, those are real things to consider.  I'm talking about hacking up the bodies, it's ungentlemanly, it's... in-human, it's fuckin' crime.  It's a work of fantasy and all in my mind, hacking up the bodies.  You can't really do it all anymore these days unless it was the only way in an act of self defense or ended up in the paperwork.  I'm an authentic person, I would prefer authentic presentations of formal ones.  I've been ridiculed and chastised over my humor and immaturity, I'm true to myself.  I'm not a beaurocrat or gentleman, I'm talking about hacking up the bodies here.
Anyway, back to my delusions of granduer and spiritual closure.  I wouldn't call it any of that at all.  It's not like I know how to explain how a mans dead and goes on to exist or re-manifest in the flesh. I'm not a scientist or a wizard that may know those things.  I wouldn't console anyone with supersition anyway, it pains me such things took hold, particularly in military organizations.  I too would venerate the great halls and Gods and Kings and Chieftains, yet, superstition wouldn't have been part of my encouragement or closure in death or battle or life. It's a lot to say with such dogma's and things demanding it, whic is an atrocity to me I have no control over.  
However, that may also be blasphemy if the battle is not ordained or sanctioned under the Lord or another diety, outside of monotheism.  I wouldn't have had Men bleed and kill in my name for eternity, I would have them fight in their own name, in their Kingdom and Crown.  There are so many communcation problems and more misunderstandings when these venerate their Chieftains.  It's not all something to break off and explain.  We in the US do not believe in their Kings and politicians being Gods, nor were we told to believe in their royal lineages or lineages at all in seperatist ideologies.  Some know about how their King is the currect acting God and sometimes believed to be descendants of the origional God or Chieftain, like the Tiwaz, Odin or Ju-Piter.  That's a little niche information, like the King just taking over the title of the Odin or Zeus so that the people would listen.  That then goes into the themes of people being obligated to follow corrupt politicians.
I'm not one to go on in sacriledge and blasphemy.  One of my previous lectures was about the decimation.  So I tend to neglect going on about the Lord lightly.  It's so infrequently I have opportunities to justify myself or explain my beliefs before whores misrepresent me.  A lot of bullshit was thrown into my lap and I would not fail to represent myself civily or in grotesque bloodshed.
I try to keep it civil while expressing the carnage coursing through my mind and soul most of the time.  It's a complete work of horror in there, I enjoy horror myself.  

I didn't have many desires in life, since I was a kid I wanted to be a soldier, warrior.  My motivations were hormones, not the movies or video games that made me think I was bad ass.  I do not even have this type of ego nor did I know the extent of my abilities. The measure of my nerve in battle was shown after the bombs started dropping and all.  It's not a campaign I'm writing about now, a lot of research and approvals need to be done before I write a novel about my war experiences.  
Planned on going back in, all this transpired, years of madness, affliction.  Got my faculties composed, not schizo.  I'm more composed than most people I know, my sense of humor is what caused me the most problems.  
I'm a veteran, hate the civilian world 10 years in.  Social reform could be encouraged and all, people are parasitic and beastial.  It's a constant undertaking working with these god dammed creatures, in this gangster society with little formalities.  
I'm working in a dining hall, make $12, full benefits, paid vacation.  I thought I could enjoy it, I do not need a lot of money to enjoy myself.  Constant ridicule for not being a corporate shill, not being rich, not wanting shit in life besides sating my hormones.  Acruing more finances is a choice I am working on.  Had entitlements in this world sitting around in limbo while my habits are studied.  
I mostly try to maintain my composure, enjoy going to the gym and my computer.  I love technology and am glad it's not the iron age or that I am not a slave or being raped and tortured.



Cheers"
1373,Does this situation make me a bad mum?,"This is every aspect of what's happened with kids father and I'll admit if I came across this post I'd probably react pretty badly to it. So im up for what might be coming to me.

I'm a single mum of two kids under 5, my youngest is being assessed got autism and my eldest has social difficulties and traits of autism and is hyper. I split from their dad a year and a half ago.

The reason I left is because he would tell me regularly that he hated coming home to us and all I did was do his head in.

When I left we split on pretty good terms,  he helped me out but letting me take whatever I needed and signed anything to help me to get on to single parenting payments.

About 5 months down the track he got into a relationship with an ex meth junkie who he was trying to sober up. She was stunning but had a really horrible way about her. I didn't know how to handle it so my jealous side went a bit out of control and the fact i couldn't get my head around my kids being around someone like that either, she was renown for being an absolute nuts case.. but i rang her work and told them that shed been to jail for meth (which she had) any way he blocked my number and i just stopped worrying about it.

I sent a letter to his house letting him know if he and his family wanted to catch up with the kids maybe they could all figure out a day in between themselves that would work.
I then got a text from his gf telling me she burned the letter and there was no way she was letting that happen.

I made a photo copy of the letter before I sent it just incase I needed it for what ever reason, so I went around to his place with the copy so i could show him and he slammed the door in my face and she was screaming out the door she was going to call the cops. 

Not long after that situation she text me saying he didn't care about the kids and never wanted to see them again, that all they did was give him the shits. I have heard him say that before. 

After all that shit happened he messaged me and said she smashed alot of stuff around the house and beat him up and had to get cops to remove her.

During this time I'd been venting to his mother saying how angry I was with him, she had enough and flipped at me and told me exactly what she thought so i did the same back. Her last message to me was a link to a song by kid rock that the main lyrics were 'I f--king hate you just f--king die' this was just after I'd said to her that their dad had backed down after his relationship fell apart and was going to start coming over to visit the kids.

Anyway we started getting along and he started to come over to my house when id invite him over. He'd have both kids a day here and there but some times when id pick them up had be losing his shit with them.

Once my 4 year old was there, he thought he'd eaten a ibuphren tablet off the bench outnof a packet, he rang me screaming. I went over and figured out son hadn't eaten it but he was so upset over his dad losing his shit about it he couldn't get any words out and had wee'd himself while I was trying to call him down all dad was saying ""im not f--ing having them again, i can't handle this f--ing shit""

After that he offered to take eldest to a hot rod show because him and his gf (different one) that has two kids under 4 that live with him at his house were going with their friends. When we arrived, son is sensitive to loud noise and has a bit of anxiety so he was unsure of walking in. Dad was waiting out the front for us. Son seemed okay so i left. Got around the corner less then a minute and i get a call saying his upset and i should take him home. I really needed this time to myself to get some things done so i went back and asked son if he wanted a piggy back ride. Dad asked me what I was doing? I said it makes him feel better. I go in with them and walk around with him to make him comfortable dad looks annoyed that his going to be stuck with him. I get home thinling I've got atleast an hour, 20 mins go by and then he gets dropped off at my place with son.
I said I really need some time to get stuff done, then he tells me that he doesn't want to because his busy. Then i ask what his doing and he said well nothing I dont know yet I MIGHT be doing something. I said you'll be fine so then i dropped them both off. 

Since then, again he came over to visit kids when I asked him. Never. Ever. Apart from 2 kids parties and this hot rod event has he text to have them or to come and visit them.

So lately about 3 weeks ago I randomly piped up the courage to ask so when will you start texting me to ask to have the kids? Or to come and visit? Because I am the one always asking you. His reply was that he doesn't have the patience for the kids problems, and he doesn't feel mentally stable.

HE is the one who has autism run through his family, HE is the one who has asperburgers and ADHD. HE doesn't have time for their problems. At this point i was in shock and basically said I thought one of the most important things in these kids lives was having their dad involved, and clearly I'm mistaken. I got pretty nasty after that.

Last week eldest was asking about his dad for a few days in a row so i said did you want to call him? He called him and didn't bother making conversation I told son to tell him how he started preschool and what he'd been doing. Dad told him he loved him and then went. Straight after i get a text saying he'll have them after he finishes work after the next month. So i asked the next day if he'd be able to deal with their problems by then? Then the day after I basically said I was frustrated that he didn't have time for their problems because it was him that they inherited it from. And said next time son rings him just leave it at that. I would've rathered he didn't text me at all or just say thanks for the call.

Does this make me an arsehole? I just feel like it's the same shit different day, I'm tired of being the one pushing this all the time. But then i worry that I'm guilty of trying to control the situation and making it harder then it needs to be. The time he told me he couldn't deal with their problems was when he felt the need to let me know that he was back with his ex, and that she loved him and that all his other exes were the same. Then i replied with, true form, women are more important then your own kids. I'd drop any guy if it interfered with how i parent the kids (which I already have)

The thing with his asperburgers I know his only so limited in what he can deal with emotionally. He also had a bad upbringing that caused him to be diagnosed with PTSD.. so I've always got that in the back of my mind. 

I don't have any social media, and if i did I'd never share this stuff on Facebook I'd never make any demeaning type posts. I'll never bag their dad out infront if them. Im an only child who dealt with both my parents, who split when I was 3 bad mouthing each other. When I was around 11 my mum told me dad cheated on her with men and how much of a sexual deviate he was. I'd never do that to my kids. 

So here it all is, out on the table to be judged by parents I dont know. I want your honest reaction to how I've come across, ive honestly got no understanding of how I'm being in this situation and would like some feedback if I could. Am I being to controlling? Is this my fault? Will my kids be angry with me? I dont know.

Thank for taking the time to read."

1375,Watching Roomate's Pets,"I usually don't have issues with anger at all; I'm Big Lebowski chill about everything 99℅ of the time. I'm watching my roommate's animals for about a week (three ferrets, a cat and a dog), and I find myself getting disproportionately angry. She didn't set boundaries with any of them, so they weren't very well behaved in the first place, but they've been especially outright awful with just me in the house. Peeing on electronics in front of me, scratching me up, pooping in the house (on purpose), the ferrets broke out of their cage while I was sleeping etc. I don't understand why I'm able to be so calm with humans, but while they're acting like this, I can feel myself flipping out. Of course, I haven't hurt them or anything, but I've noticed myself raising my voice more in the past day than I have in months. 

I know it isn't their fault, I know this is a result of how they have (or haven't) been trained. I'm just having trouble understanding my reaction. 

I did grow up with an emotionally neglectful and manipulative alcoholic mom who used to abuse our animals if that makes any difference."

I’ve had a psychosis 2,5 years ago which escalated into many panic attacks and hallucinations and after that a depression.

1381,I’ve been wondering if anyone else feels any of these.,"I wanted to know if anyone in high school or is a teenager is feeling like this.
I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to be alive.
Whenever I think about my future I just want to quit. When I see someone dying on the news or getting a terminal disease I can’t control the fact that I wish I was them.

Every part of my life doesn’t match up, my music taste,my hobbies/interests, academic life, social life, etc are all different and that leaves me in with a small roll in several different friend groups but never actually spending much time with people outside of school. I feel like I’m being split into pieces by each part of my life pulling in a different direction and I’m left in the middle with nothing.

I don’t think I’ll ever have a relationship either.
My social life isn’t horrible and I do have friends but nobody sees me in any way beside friend. I have missed 100% of the shots I’ve taken and just don’t want to continue to disappoint myself.

1382,What's the proper method for dealing with suppressed emotions,"For a long time in my youth people said I wore my emotions on my sleeve, I also had a very bad anger issue that I never got professional help for. Over time I learned to simply suppress and ignore any and all negative emotion, along with that I feel I started to suppress the positive emotions as well. To this day I feel little anger, sadness, joy or any other feeling. If I do get an angry outburst, it feels like I just collect it internally and go numb to it. In the past I would want to scream and hit something and now its just a deep sigh followed by numbness or a void. 
So I guess my question is whether or not others have ever dealt with such an experience and if so how did you overcome it."

I’m not in a situation where I can get any sort of help right now, and I’m so tired of it. I want nothing more then to stomp into a clinic and finally get diagnosed with something, or receive help.

1386,"Trouble with motivation, energy and growing up.","Well, here I am. I have fallen into a rut. Like always. I have no motivation, no drive. It's weird. Low energy, always moody. A week ago, I had a sudden burst of energy that lasted for this past week and today it died. It always happens that way. 1 month of horrible agonizing time being a lazy pos and then a promising week of me actually doing stuff, being productive and motivated; ready to start fresh all over again. Then it just dies. Why? WHY!!!?? It's so freaking annoying because I don't choose to sit here and do nothing all day. I don't choose to stay in my room ignoring friends and playing games/watching videos all day. The days I get up and do stuff I get so happy. I mean, I still ldo stuff every day but with the same ""this is the usual"" type of deal. 

For example,.when I'm in one of those good vibes for a week, I'll clean the whole house to perfection and keep it that way all week and then when my motivation dies back down, I do the bare minimum so they don't kick me out lol. It's seriously annoying because I love those high energy and happy times. It's been annoying how for years it's been the same cycle of no motivation, motivation, no- and continue. I've tried to figure out what causes the energy spikes but I honest to God don't have an answer. If anyone can help me and give me some suggestions I would absolutely love to hear them. I am beyond tired of being a failure. 

And the idea of me having wasted my childhood on doing nothing and my teenage years on getting high and wasted all the time is really soul crushing. Here I am wanting to go back when back then I couldn't wait to be here now. I just hate the fact that I can't go back. I hate the idea that I'll never experience things the same way ever again. I'll never have another late night insomnia riddled stroll though the trailer while everyone else sleeps. Acting as if I'm on some secret mission. No more experiencing things for the first time again. Like wind chimes. Our neighbors used to have some and I have a memory I go back to Everytime I hear similar chimes. It was a windy sunny cool spring day. Everything about that memory is great and I remember taking it in as a kid. Soaking up all the sun and all of the world around me. 

Now, everything feels so lifeless, less vivid and everyday it's just the same. I don't know. I just know that if I had the chance to go back and relive all of the good moments, I would in a heartbeat. 

The reason I used to love weed so much was because it put me back in that mindset of what the world was like as a kid. Vibrant and full of life. I don't get that anymore and now it's just being high. Oh well. Sorry for the wall of text."
1387,Struggling,"I am really struggling tonight.

To be honest with you...I am really struggling tonight. I am struggling to feel my worth. I am struggling to do anything. I cannot stop crying. I am just struggling.

1388,My Bipolar brain,"Im not sure how this story goes or where to start it or how it even began or why i am even writing it. All i know it this exact moment is that i was just lying in bed and anxiety and depression had come over me, feelings of disconnection from myself and a profound disconnect to other people. Physically uncomfortable, my nose slightly stuffed and realize that its going to be one of those nights where thoughts race. Which is the beginning of an indefinite series of nights of insomnia. So i decided to get up, sit on the couch, open my notes app and start writing.

And so this story begins...... i guess for me its a story well too known but never understand where it will take me next, this time around. Its that ferocious vicious cycle of “fear”. The rain before the storm which preceded by a storm that just passed with a few sunny days in between. The thunder brewing in the background, flashes of light in the sky that warns you somethings coming. The warning bells ring and you have to hold on to something tight, ground yourself before your swept away. 

Life is complicated. And trauma, ptsd mental illness, and addiction complicates it even more. Knowing whats going on, being aware of whats happening is half the problem and half the solution. Your action or reaction to whats unfolding is where the story turns one way or another. The other half of the solution is depending on which way you turn."

People where cheering and laughing and I thought they where screaming in terror. My heart sank; I thought someone was shooting at us. I don’t know what this all means, but I hate it.

1390,Currently in a depressive state only to find out my brother is also very depressed and it made me more depressed,"This is basically just a vent. Dont habe anyone to confide to. :'(

Yesterday I had a trigger which threw me back to a depressive state. I tried to distract myself by watching fleabag but i was too depressed to sustain my interest. I ended up curling up into a ball and sleep half of the way away. 

Today I found out through my older sister that my younger brother--who is also manic-depressive-- is also having a depressive episode. We live in the same house together with our older sister who, thankfully is mentally normal. 

She asked me to keep an eye on my brother. She's not aware of my current mental state. This scenario has happened a number of times before. It's doubly hard when you're depressed but you have to keep it to yourself because you dont wanna add to the stress your older sister is going through having to support two mentally ill adult siblings on top of being a single mom. 

I want to scream in frustration but i cant because i know that my brother needs me right now but I'm also so emotionally and mentally weak at the moment and knowing that i cant afford to be depressed at the moment is triggering me.

more context: i have a long history of bipolar depression, hospitalizations, ECT procedures and been on different combos of medication. I'm in my thirties, cant support myself financially (i used to be able to when my depression wasnt this worse yet).

I'm just so exhausted being in this cycle and I dont want to feel selfish but not having enough strength to lift my brother up right now fuels my guilt even more."

1393,"Lowest point in life, but happiest I’ve ever been","TLDR; I’m 16, got dumped, drove over 1000 miles solo, total’d my car out of state, got a restraining order filed against me, and got accused of attempted murder, and can’t make it to my court dates. But, I feel the best I have in years.

Hey guys, created this account just to ask this question, and share the absolute nightmare this week has been.

So, straight off the bat I would like to disclose that I am 16. I’ve been diagnosed with both Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Clinical Depression. I am on Buspar and Wellbutrin to help cope with both. I’ve suffered childhood trauma for almost the entirety of my childhood, with the deaths of two of my brothers, and the collapse of my family.

Now, with that general info out of the way, onto the point of this post. I’ve had a pretty shitty life, but this week has been the absolute worse time of my life. But I feel the happiest I’ve ever been.
It all started Saturday. I got in a serious argument with my long-term, long distance girlfriend. We ended up breaking up, and I lost all communication with her. I hated the way we ended, as I acted like a childish asshole. I *needed* to apologize. I physically couldn’t stand not getting the chance to. So, I got ready. I live in Southern Utah, and I just barely got my own car licensed and insured, after having my Drivers License forever. I had 30 bucks in my pocket, the gas in my tank, told my mother I was going on a trip, grabbed one of my guns for protection, and I got in the car, and just drove. I don’t really have any responsibilities in my life, as I left school, and was on leave from my job. My now Ex-girlfriend lives in Aurora Colorado, which is a suburb of Denver. But from my location, that’s an 800 mile drive. I knew I couldn’t make it with the 30 bucks of gas money I had. So, I firstly drove 6 hours to Phoenix, Arizona, where I met two of my best online friends for the first time ever. They gave me about 75 bucks in gas money, a fuck-ton of food and water, and a spare phone for GPS. With the money, I started to head to Denver. I made it back to the Arizona border by the time it was about 2 a.m, and I needed to sleep. I parked in a parking lot to a gas station, got in the back sleep, covered up, and went to sleep. At least I tried. That was the absolute coldest I have ever been, and was only able to sleep about an hour. So, I started driving again. It was a 13 hour drive, from Phoenix, but I finally made it to Denver. I had just drove over 1000 miles in about a day and a half, running off an hour of sleep, and living off junk food. Surely the worst had passed, right?

Hell no. Life, in its infinite ironic cycle, came full circle. I drove all that way, completely fine. Then, literally a block from her house, I wrecked. My car was absolutely total’d, as it got decimated by a truck. Other than a minor concussion, I was fine. But, I was 16 years old, 1000 miles from home, no guardian, no money, and a shotgun in my backseat. The initial confrontation with the cops went fine. I got my gun confiscated, contacted my mother, gave me a ticket, it was fine. When they asked if I knew anyone in town, I have them her address. They went and spoke to her mothers, as my Ex wasn’t home, and it was very clear I wasn’t welcomed there. So, I got back in the police car, and they dropped me off at a hotel. An adult hotel. And left me. I couldn’t check in, as you had to be 21. But I didn’t have any money, so it didn’t matter. I was kicked out of the motel after a couple hours of being in the lobby. My mother trying frantically to find me a way home, the police were busy talking to my ex and her family. My mother finally found me a Bus ride from Denver to Utah, so she got me a ticket, and ordered me a Lyft.

My ex and her family are CONVINCED I went there to kill her. So, she filed a restraining order. By this time I was on the bus home. I never saw my ex, and honestly at that point, I didn’t care to anymore. I figured the worst was behind me. Nope.

I got home, got forced to get taken to the hospital for a Psych Evaluation, got questioned by the police again on why I had a gun, got handed the restraining order papers, and told that I had to appear in an Aurora court in 6 days for a hearing, or the effects of the restrictions would be in affect indefinitely. Honestly, I could care less about being able to see her. But while under a restraining order, it’s a Felony to buy a gun, and I absolutely love guns. It’s now Thursday. I haven’t slept more than 5 hours in the last week, I’ve been accused by someone I loved of attempted murder, wrecked my car, and questioned by the police. But I feel fine. I feel great, actually. This is the most cluster-fuck amount of events to ever happen to me, but this is the best I’ve felt in years. I haven’t had a panic attack in days, which are usually a daily occurrence for me. 

My question is why..? Given my crippling anxiety, you’d think I’d be completely debilitated. I know it’s not because my ex is out of my life, as my anxiety was a problem before her. Maybe the experience of the drive?

I have my court dates on the 19th of March for the traffic ticket, and the hearing for the restraining order on the 26th of this month. I’ve mailed a motion to the Aurora Police Department to try and get something arranged in Utah, as it’s impossible for me to get back there.

I just want some feedback on this phenomenon. If I continue to feel this way, then my life is definitely heading in a way more positive direction. Like I said, I haven’t had a panic attack since I left.

If you have any questions, please ask. It’s midnight, I’m completely exhausted, and I still feel the affects of the concussion. So sorry if this post didn’t make much sense, or is way too convoluted. I’d be more than happy to clear up any confusion.

Sorry for the really long post. It’s been a really long week."

1395,I don’t know what’s happening.,"So I’m going to make this short. I wrote three paragraphs and deleted everything because it was too long lmao. But in short I don’t know why I’m always having random bursts of sadness and whenever a room gets noisy with a group of people I always start to feel anxious and like I need to pace and catch my breathe. Then when there’s minute things like tapping or someone shaking their leg to where there’s an audible squeak from the chair, I always get super angry about it.

This has been going on since I was young about 12 (20 now). Something new though that has gone along with these problems is the fact that I am now starting to hear voices. Sometimes they are quiet and say negative things and occasionally what they say will be unclear loud gibberish and I will break down crying almost feeling the need to hit my head because they’re loud. And what’s weird is it isn’t my voice.

To add onto this as well is the fact that I’m apparently smelling things that aren’t there either. A couple days ago I smelled someone cooking ribs (there was nobody doing that) to confirm what I was smelling, which was very strong, I asked my roommate if he smelled the bbq too. He replied with no. It didn’t go further than that. Yesterday morning and this morning I smelled what I believed to be methane gas, of course I was concerned and asked if my friend had smelled it and he reply back it’s a forsure no. And finally this morning and right now as I’m typing this I smell cat litter.. yes cat litter. We have no cat nor a dirty litter so I don’t know where that came from.

So I’m realizing I am starting to have these hallucinations and I don’t know if it’s just an episode or if I’m crazy or wtf is going on but I would like to know what’s wrong or if y’all have an idea? (Yes I’m going to get seen as well by a medical professional)"

1397,I’m 17 with extremely close minded Hispanic Christian parents and I’m forbidden to seek help regarding my mental health,"So I’m basically just gonna give you a shorter version of what has been going on lately back in 8 grade I used to get bullied a lot to the point were 27 out 31 people from my class were planning to jump me I somehow go through a movie cliche and get hot during summer mostly because I hated my scars, my parents fat shamed me a lot and I was too depressed to eat.
During 8 grade I was hospitalized twice with 6 suicide attempts, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, PTSD, OCD, ADHD. I used to take a lot of medication like around 8 pills a day 
So high school comes in it’s my freshman year I start getting attention that I’m not used to, everything was going well until I was r*ped during homecoming, I pretended I was fine for weeks until one day in class during an argument with a student a girl called me a whore and something just kinda clicked in me I had a mental breakdown and was later hospitalized once I got out My schedule was changed but I was too embarrassed to go back to school and I started talking to a “17 year old boy” online who when I had later met he turned out to be 26 years old and now I was too emotionally unstable to care so I went to his house, he drugged me and we had sex and this went on and on for weeks now you might be thinking if my parents were strict how did I meet up with this man? 
I would ditch school everyday and since I put my phone number as my moms only I would get the calls from the school 
The 26 year old became my boyfriend at 13 and would some times force me to have sex with him 
I would tell him to stop but I was too drugged to stop him.
 
After the 1st semester I decided I wanted to be better. got homeschooled but had to take care of my 1 year old sister with my other sister who was 16 at the time yet my relationship with this man continued since every time I would try to break up he would threaten to kill himself fast forward a bit I know go to a charter school were I still get called a whore even though I don’t talk at all I just finally broke up with the man and you know never really got the chance to cope with everything that occurred to me and it kinda just hit me 
I have never asked for help but the one time I do ask for help to my parents they said no I tried to explain them my situation but all my mom did was tell me that it was my fault because of the way I dress and that she feels disgusted of me for being bi 

My question to you is 
Do you think I should start medication again? If so does planned Parenthood provide that kind of service because I would have to do this behind my parents backs and just how do I even get help without getting hospitalized

From the bitter dark, I rise.

The day after, I put on my shoes and brush my teeth.

A spoonful of honey and a bowl of yogurt.

A glass of milk and homemade toast.

Homework shoved into my bag haphazardly, 

Pills in my front pocket.

The day after, the sun rises. 

Plants reach towards its warmth as it touches every surface and crevice. 

The world glows.

Flowers open.

Flowers given.

Green leaves falling 

White picket fences

A dog looking for his best friend, 

A dog waiting, for eternity

.

The day after, I feel loved.

The girl I hardly know writes.

The boy I nod at in the corridors remembers.

My mother tidys my room and makes my bed, 

ready for the next day and for forever.

.

The day after, I love.

I fall in love with my friends.

The way they smile, hands hovering over my belongings,

As they hug their knees and struggle to breath,

I tell them it’ll be alright, I’m here for them.

.

But I’m not.

.

The day after, I weep.

A spoonful of honey and a bowl of yogurt.

The warm sun rising, saying hello to the flowers.

Green leaves falling.

Love.

.

For death welcomed me with arms wide, 

it beckoned me, 

Grasped me with its long, bony fingers.

It whispered to me;

Everything I want would be over if I were to simply enter its embrace.

But death didn’t tell me it continues, the world moves on.

.

The day after I go home.

I find myself the day before 

I tell him not to do it

I tell him they weep the day after

I tell him there is no day after

For he knows, but he fails to see the warmth of the day after.

.

A spoonful of honey and a bowl of yogurt.

The warm sun rising, saying hello to the flowers

Green leaves falling 

Love.

The day after, I sleep and sleep, for death is cold and eternal

Sorry for the weird formatting it won't work for me atm."
1403,Just a vent+needing advice,"I know I'm more of a younger kid, (F13-14) and it's probably just that 'edgy teen' faze as I've been told, but I honestly am not doing alright. It's just like there's this heavy, sinking weight on my chest all of time time, and I feel like I want to cry. It isn't just that either, It's just one of the worst results of whatever faze I'm going through. My parents aren't much help either, even with my mother being a mental health professional. (One reason why I'm afraid to ever contact the suicide hotline just in case she found out. I don't want to end up getting punished/laughed at/shamed/ignored or whatever else she could do. I just want to be upset and get through this in peace.) Another part of it just seems to happen in a snap. I'll be fine. I'll be happy. I'll have my friends near me, we'll be having a good time, and then it hits me hard. This 'hit' can be triggered by anything small: a comment on who I am, a sorta-insult? (Ex: If I feel proud of myself for something I did, and I will say something like ""Hey that thing I did was nice! No one expected that from me, I bet!"" And a friend is like.. ""Yeah, OP, no one expected that from y o u."") Or anything negative in general, It just doesn't feel nice. I get the insults, I'm a very.. stylized person (Ex: 5'1 girl who wears cat ears. unintentionally sounds like someone from an anime, with an annoyingly high pitched voice, 'stances' I do when I get excited, ""sweetheart"" of the class..) but I've never minded the weird looks or comments I get on these things In specific, because they're simply things I do that make me happy. Just 'cuz I feel like it. And my friends have always been chill with it, they've kinda just accepted that's who I am at this moment in time.. so I don't think that's it. But even with all these positive aspects, I still feel miserable, even if I don't deserve to feel miserable because others have it worse than me, and I feel so guilty for it. So lets focus on the negative. I'm annoying. To put it plainly, I don't mean to be, I just have certain parts of my personality that don't mix well with the majority. I am very shy and introverted, I love my friends but I just generally prefer my own company. I don't speak much and I'm constantly giggling at something. My sense of humor is what you'd expect, dick jokes, memes, and smartass/sarcastic comments, and because my friend group is made up of entirely Jr. High boys with the exception of my bestfriend, there's always an annoying, weebish, high pitched and very girly giggle happening. No one has ever said anything, but I can't stand my giggle. Its so ugly, and almost sounds fake, but its genuine and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm also very stubbon and feisty, can't take a compliment for the life of me, and I'm clingy. I have certain people I hold close to me, and I just want to be near them alot and talk to them alot. Which is bad. I am not the ""center of attention"" in their life so this behavior is unacceptable. I have to give them space, being there all the time is unhealthy. That's bad. This method of thinking happens a lot, too. Where I will try to act 'proper' and what I think proper is and punish myself harshly if I fail those high expectations of myself. But I need to. A lot of people look up to me for advice. I have to be good for them. These punishments usually include at best, a scolding on a piece of paper of everything I did wrong, or at the worst, I don't allow myself food or socialization for a period of time. I also feel ignored and brushed over a lot, but that's because I'm quiet/shy. It's not that I don't want attention, I just don't know how to ask for it without sounding selfish or dramatic or needy. I don't get attention from my parents either. They call me names a lot and or treat me like I'm 5. Even with all of this though, I have denied any issues for awhile. I pushed a friend away multiple times when he would ask me about what was going on when I was upset, but I never told him anything. Now that I'm ready to say things though, and I need anyone who would listen.. I lost one of the only people who would. I have a lot of beef and bad-feelings with this person In general, but I've forced myself to bottle them because he refuses to talk about them. He kinda hates me, I think, which I understand. But that's ok, things might not be healthy between us, at least on my side, right now.. but I can bottle it for awhile longer. He's not the problem, I just want to blame things on him because I don't know what else to do with what I'm feeling. I've also self harmed before, but I've talked about it with my cousin and 2 other friends of mine. They didn't know what to do or say though, which made me feel worse, but its ok. They tried their best. They tried to listen, and that's enough, even if it backed tracked on me. Jr. High is really hard, and I know most of you who come across this is probably like ""hah. Dramatic much, edgy teenage weeb?"" But that's ok too, I understand it. If I could ask though, how did you get through it.. can I get some advice?

-And with that I apology for grammar, spelling, and or things that generally dont make sense. I won't be editing this. Thank you for sticking through to the end though. I really respect you and its really kind of you to take the time to look at this. You're a beautiful person, so don't forget that!"
1404,"Trigger warning!!! I was raped 2 years ago, and I still don’t feel alive, despite everything I’ve done","I’ve never written on reddit before or even spoken up this much but and 4:31 am feeling half dead from insomnia, ranting will help me I think, I’m not going to edit this at all to keep it authentic. I really hope that I can connect to someone, know that you are not alone. Despite how alone you may feel. You may have your family and friends calling you crazy or mocking you, but that doesn’t make them true. There are people who will stand by you, even if they are on the internet. Please keep fighting, as I will for you.

I don’t really know what to say. Being raped has ruined my life. I was raped by my best friend of three years when I was in high school in grade 12, on numerous occasions. Having been my best friend before all of this I felt so guilty for being upset with him and hurt. I felt empathy for him because he was my best friend. I wanted to be his friend even after everything despite feeling in so much pain. I was a virgin, and at the time I wanted to stay that way until marriage, he knew that. And I felt conflicted between treating this person as a friend or an enemy. Even now I still do sometimes, when I reminisce on the good times we had before it all. However he wasn’t conflicted at all. He had no care that I was in so much pain, all he wanted to do was to protect himself and his relationships with everyone including his girlfriend (which he claimed was an open relationship, which I found out was a lie). And so my last year of high school was hell. He told everyone things about me, I don’t even know exactly what. Ive only heard of people thinking of me and calling me names like psycho. Like I made everything up. That got to me. I lost almost all of my friends to whatever lies he spread, I felt helpless and alone. And I even started to believe that maybe I was a psychotic individual and that everything that happened was something I hallucinated or something. Even now two years later I still feel that pain and questioning.

The sad thing is, it’s two years later. I’m in the most loving relationship I could have, with someone who is supportive of me and understanding. I have a job, and I’m out of the house a lot working towards something; I have a purpose. I live with my boyfriend and his family and we are working towards a life together, moving out. I’m out of my mum and step dads house, which is extremely good for me because my step dad mocked me when I cried out for help after cutting myself and mocked me for being raped. And I’ve been clean from drugs and alcohol for a year (I started after the rape). 

Even with all these, I still have nightmares almost every night of the incidents. I have crippling anxiety and depression. I have terrible insomnia, and I genuinely feel lost as to what else I can do to help get over everything that happened. I just feel so angry, that someone I trusted would do this to me and then ruin my relationships with all my friends. I even sometimes have nightmares of seeing those friends, and it breaks me down so much. I often have temptations of going back to the drugs to feel numb and not worry so much about everything and forget it all. I know it’s a bad idea but nothing else has ever helped so much and I don’t know what would help more or even equally.


Side note; I’ve gone to therapy all my life, and have been on medications for depression and anxiety, but nothing has helped substantially enough."
1405,"Just needed to make a post on how I felt, no need to be read","Hey,
I've been contemplating making a post for several days...  I am 16 and have never talked about problems- especially emotionally- that I have with people.  I'm not very good at describing how I feel either so sorry for the long post.

The last few years have been pretty rough in my family after my nan died, the past few years have been sorting out the house and my grandads care etc.  During this time there was a period where I felt so down all the time and I'd rather have just been dead.  It sounds like what people have described depression as but, not in a bad way, I have a house, I have dinners to eat, I dont have anything to be depressed about.

I got out of that with the help of my dog (sounds stupid ik) and I've been a pretty optimistic person that enjoys life.

However, a few days ago my girlfriend broke up with me, I found it to be the most fulfilling (I don't know what other word to use) relationship I've ever had.  Some of my friends were friends with her too so I'm not involved with things they do anymore and my other friends don't talk much so I end up talking at them for hours and whenever I've tried to discuss problems with them they've not helped.
The other week I saw a dead guy in the road.  On my run I was at the scene of a death about a minute or two after it happened.  I'm still struggling to get it out of my head.  My school brags about how good their mental health department is but I've never felt welcomed there and everyone knew that I'd seen this and only one person talked to me for a minute to say ""are you okey,, he wasn't even on the mental health team.  My normal state of conversation is very light and humourous, I tend to cover up how I feel with appearing happy to others.  It annoys me that people don't see how I feel but equally I don't want them to know.

I feel like shit since losing the only person that liked the same music, shows, activities, and had the same personality as me.  I'm on school holidays and it's super quiet not having anyone to talk to.  It doesn't help that we were totally fine as normal on Sunday and Monday started with a call from her saying she has her own ways to go and wants to break up.
I don't know how to put my feelings on it into words.
I guess this is normal stuff after a breakup but I'm just struggling to cope with everything, doesn't help that I'm in my exam year.

I'm not suicidal, I'm not going to be dead in 24hours but at the minute it doesn't seem a bad idea.  I don't know what I'm trying to get at in this post, nor what I'm trying to get out of it.

I'm enjoying stuff I do, but underneath that feel really shit.  I don't want any of that to sound edgy 16 year old, it's not.  I just want to stop feeling lonely and confused and tbh, pretty depressed.  I don't know how to explain what I'm thinking, I don't even need replies to any of this, I just want to know that someone in the world knows and would care for how I felt, I guess.  Thanks, I hope ya can have a good day."
1406,Is it normal to not want anything?,"I've been thinking about it so much, I don't know if this state of mind os normal or not. Maybe it's just me and I'm just lost. Anyway, I've always been aimless. I have no goals, no plans whatsoever, and I I think the worst thing is I have no motivation. There's nothing inside of me that might motivate me to move forward, to make plans for my future. There's really nothing I want for myself. The only thing I'm sure of is that I don't want to be a burden, but what can I do when I can't come up with the energy and courage to put myself out there? 

I'm not sure if this is all fear or a lack of drive or both.
I realize I sound fucking pathetic. It's been like this for a long while now and I'm getting tired. I'm growing tired of myself and I feel ashamed whenever  I have to tell anyone that I don't do anything at the moment. I hate my brain. I don't know. I hate myself because I'm like this, but it's like a mental block. It's like I can't think. There's nothing in my head."
1407,can someone help me?,"I'm really struggling here and I think I'm going to ask my mom to take me to a mental hospital, I just don't feel safe with myself anymore but i'd like to already have a good hospital in mind so here's the sitch

1410,I need alittle help,"
So i’m having a really rough time figuring out if i was sexually abused, raped, or sexually assaulted, or any of those at all. Here’s my story: 

I was around 9 or 10 when I was with a boy in a bush. This bush was empty on the inside for context. We were hanging out and I was just talking to him, when he mentioned wanting to do acts of intercourse with me. I then reluctantly gave him a yes, and he started putting his penis inside of me. I then gave him oral, and he forced my head down a couple of times. I stopped and he asked me to keep doing it. I said no and he kept asking so I put my clothes back on. I sat down again to talk to him, and he asked me a couple more times before i firmly said no. he backed off and put his clothes back on. He would make me watch moaning noises and made me “do it” a couple more times before I finally stopped going with him to the bush. He was 10 or 11. Was I the perpetrator for doing it? Should I tell someone? Am I a sexual predator? Was I the victim, or was there no victims? I don’t know anymore, but i’m just so confused on what it is. Thank you for any help"
1411,Vitamin D insufficency,"I just wanted to share something for a minute.

I have been diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression for 10 years. I always told my therapists I am too exhausted to activate myself, I barley got out of bed in the morning and was really happy if I managed to organize food.

I have been in several wards over the years and they did bloodwork and checkups everytime I arrived. But it wasn't until my family doctor ran an extensive workup 6 months ago (he thought such extensive exhaustion could well have a physical reason) that he found I had a vitamin D insufficency. He said it wasn't severe but definitly there. So he prescribed some solution with vitamin D.

Within days my sleep went from 11 - 12h to 8h per day. I could get up in the morning without major problems and I had enough energy to start some minor movement (like going for a walk, do some stretching and pay my bills etc).

Point is my therapists told me for 10 years I just needed to motivate myself (""I can't do the work for you..."") and it turns out a big contributor was something fixed withing 2 minutes of finding it.

Don't get me wrong, I am not wonderously healed. But I feel much better and am in a position to treat myself. I can do stuff. The overwhelming feeling of helplessness is gone. 

So unsolicited advice. If you get diagnosed with depression it might be a good idea to have an extensive physical workup independently of the psychhospital too. Maybe there is some physical component. And the workups the psychiatric hospitals do, seem to be very limited! (If you have a hammer and all that)

Just wanted to share."
1412,"Has anyone noticed that similar behaviors occurring in men and women, men seem to be forgiven easier? Like being an asshole vs being a bitch. Maybe it’s just my fucked up family consisting of mostly women. Just seems that way. I’ve owned up to my mistakes but still feel a pull from them.",
1413,Do I have asd?,"I'm trying to come to terms with myself. So basically I started going out with this guy a year ago, who has mental health issues and self harms, and I started cutting last year. It's got progressively worse and my mum has just found out, everyone thinks me and my bf are very bad for eachother, and my mum says I've been controlling and manipulating him. I don't know how to stop being controlling, or what to do. My dad has asd, so with my lack of social skills, ticks, and inwardness my mum thinks I may also have asd. I've spent most of my life very naive and not noticed, or cared, I'm not normal. I also take on the persona of whoever I'm around, which apparently is a common trait of asd, I can't stop it and I hate it, I want to stop but I don't know how to. Does anyone have any advice?"
1414,Fucking hate myself,"So damn tired of myself. I should have been looking for jobs already in the beginning of Jauary, but I had some family troubles so I mentally wasn’t able to. Now I’m here, still looking for a summer job, in the field I’ve been studying for four years. My friend just got a summer job at my dream place, a place where they’ve said before that they can’t take summer workers. I’m so fucking pissed off and I’m so tired of myself. I feel miserable. I wish I didn’t exist. I always work hard, but I don’t work in a smart way. I’m an introverted shy person who does their best to erase that part of myself. I’ve gotten more than enough in my life that should make me succeed, but no. I’m a fucking loser who can’t achieve anything. The self-hatred in this post is pretty huge, but I’m done with myself. It doesn’t matter how hard I try, I’ll still never succeed and make my dreams come true. I’m a person who’s known for their optimism, but that hasn’t lead me anywhere, has it.  Fuck me."

1417,Identity crisis,"My brain is completely fucked right now. I had a fight my with my ""boyfriend"" , he doesn't love me. He said that before always been honest with me. Doesn't want a relationship of pity and doesn't want to be my savior. We've been together 6 months. He's thrown in the word g boyfriend a bunch of times but yesterday in a big fight he said it's nothing. He's not seeing anyone else but he said we are not exclusive. I've gone out with other people in the beginning but he's the one I've been with throughout. We spend everyday together and he said I'm weak and cling to a guy. Makes no new plans with me except coffee at the usual place or something. He had an ex that was severely depressed and he broke up with her after 3 years and he said he doesn't want to deal with another one. I am a very very negative and depressed person. I'm so scared that I will end up with someone too vanilla nice  or depressed like me. So some of his claims are valid. I feel that deep down he does care for me. But my identity is completely broken. I don't know what to do or feel. I want to quit my degree. I want to sleep till I'm dead."
1418,I just want to stop feeling like a failure.,"I'm not suicidal but I just want to stop feeling numb with hot tears sliding endlessly down my fucking face. I've been in such a rut for a month with no job... just pure laziness. My partner is sick of me for not doing what he wants because I'm depressed as shit. 

I get such intense waves of emotion where I cry out and feel like my chest is going to burst and then just empty numbness. I just want to sleep all the time. I just want to stop feeling like this. I want to be happy again. There is no light at the end of my tunnel."
1419,[Kinda Dark] Just gonna dump this word vomit here,"I had a big long post but I somehow deleted half of it, cried, gave up, then came back because I need to do this.

I really need to just word vomit. I’m sorry in advance.

I’m 20F from Ohio. I’m clinically depressed, have anxiety, and recently went through a major medical scare.

Some back story:
I had a verbally abusive mother so I moved in and lived with my paternal grandmother. Dad was in the army and moved too much. My grand mother and I are very close, we think so much alike that we catch ourselves saying the same thing at the same time multiple times a day. We know intuitively how the other is feeling even when we aren’t near. We are each others best friends, and I hope nothing more than to be as good as she is. About three years ago my grandfather moved in with us, his job was in another state and when he retired he moved back in. He is a very mean spirited, angry drunk. A traditional thinker, he believes that he is always right and has the final say simply because he is a male and is old. He and I fought a lot because I held my ground and wouldn’t let him bully me or my grandmother. About six months ago I got fed up with living my entire life in my bedroom to avoid him and moved in with my boyfriend.

I havent been on my antidepressants for about two years, I was handling myself fairly well. When I moved I lost it.

To pay rent I’d gotten a job at a popular craft retail chain. We were chronically understaffed and my introverted, perfectionist, anxious, extreme people pleasing personality did not mesh well with customer service. Every day, by the end of shift, I was so destroyed. My legs would give out, I was dizzy/lightheaded, noticeably limping and just a total wreck. I’d cry in the parking lot before my shift because I just did not want to go in. I would rather have died than gone into work. I’d developed sciatic nerve pain, and some days my leg just would not support my weight. It was so bad I literally could not walk, so I had to call off. So I also had anxiety of underperforming at work, even though I was a goodie two shoes and all my managers loved me. I honestly thought all my issues were just because I was new to the workforce and just needed to toughen up. I mean thats what everyone told me when I complained.

I was also going to college full time, still am, and struggled to get my work done. I’d come home at 10:30 at night and rush to get classwork done before midnight. I couldn’t get ahead of my classes because I was too busy trying to find the motivation to get out of bed, let alone exist. I also did all the cleaning. My boyfriend and I have two roommates, and neither of them know how or want to clean. I was frustrated because the house was a mess. I felt like a failure because of how bad it was.

Outside of work, I only really socialized with my boyfriend. When I moved in with him, I moved an hour away from my grandmother and any friends I’d ever made. I still texted them, but I’d already drifted from all but two.

My diet changed drastically. I went from homemade healthy food to take out and frozen stuff. Needless to say, I physically felt like shit. My stomach hated me, at night I’d be so sick I’d nearly vomit. 

I’d often crawl out of bed in the middle of the night and sob silently on the floor in the corner. I missed my grandmother, hated my job, and was tired of being in so much pain. I didn’t want to wake my boyfriend because he worked early in the morning and I didn’t want to bother him.

Eventually I had an emergency. I had to call my boyfriend home from work early and have him take me to urgent care. 

When taking a bath to care for what I thought was sciatic nerve pain, I had noticed my calf was twice the size of the other, discolored, and hard as a rock. When I stood I lost vision, hearing, and motor controls. I stumbled to a couch and laid down until it all came back. When we got to UC I got called a dumbass and was told I not only likely had a blood clot, but also likely had a stroke. We were told to get to an ER because I could just die at any moment. All I could think was as soon as I decided that I wanted to live and have my own life, I’m going to die.

I spent ten days in the hospital, two of which were in the ICU. Multiple clots in a lung and a massive one in my leg. I now have a stint in one of my veins because of maythurners syndrome. I also may have some blood disorder which makes my blood thicker and more likely to clot. I refused to learn the name because I only tested positive on two of the six proteins they tested, and was told it could be a false positive.

Its two months post hospital now. I lost my job, as an at will part time employee, I was laid off/fired because I couldn’t come into work. I’ve spent a lot of time struggling with recovering. I still have pain and don’t have the stamina I use to, but I have improved greatly since the hospital. 

I was terrified that I would just keel over at any given moment for a long time. I refused to drive for fear I would keel over behind the wheel, and every night I was afraid my boyfriend would wake up to my body the next morning. I’ve been told the chances of that happening are about as high as the average persons (nearly zero), but I’m still very anxious about my health.

I’m struggling with the guilt of keeping the house clean even more now that I don’t have a job. When I first got out of the hospital the house was totally disgusting. My boyfriend spent all his free time at the hospital with me, so our roommates were left home alone. I swear to god, the house must not have been cleaned since I was admitted it was so bad. I’ve been busting my ass to get the house back to where it was. I was able to get the communal space at least decent, and now exhaust myself to keep it clean. 
Because I’m not at my full stamina, it takes me all day to get the kitchen/living room clean, and the next day when I want to clean the bathroom or my space, what I already cleaned is a disaster again. I once heard a roommates friend complain about how gross the bathroom was, and I just...I have no words to express how much of a failure I feel like.

School has gotten even harder. I have no motivation. I want to do class work, I know I have to, but my brain just wont let me. I try to focus and do it but my mind just wont process whats going on. I end up procrastinating and feeling guilty and getting frustrated that I just cant do my work. I stress and frantically rush to finish things the day they are due, and more often than not I have to let one class’s assignment go undone for the sake if finishing something for another class. Its gotten to the point where my boyfriend practically has to babysit me to make sure I get my work done. He helps me process what the assignments are and helps me stay on task. He says he doesn’t mind, that he’s still spending time with me and thats all he wants. Also that he enjoys helping me, it makes him feel useful and needed. I still feel guilty that this is what he’s doing after coming home from his 9-5 job.

And on days when I’m really deep in a depressive episode, where I’ll start crying at any moment for no apparent reason, my boyfriend spends all his time trying to make me feel better.  I’m scared he’s going to burn himself out and get angry at me for not getting happy, for not ‘appreciating’ his efforts, and I tell him so. I tell him not to try so hard, that I don’t want him getting upset that he cant make me feel better, that its nothing that either of us can control, its just the chemicals in my brain. He reassures me that he is fine and isn’t ever going to get burnt out, he understands its chemicals, but its not going to stop him from trying.

I have even less socialization now.  I have a tendency to get very anxious of driving when I haven’t driven in a while, that combined with my not seeing a reason to leave the house since I don’t have money, has lead to me becoming very anxious about leaving the house in general. My boyfriend tries to encourage me to go driving just to get out of the house. I agree that I should, but why waste the gas when I don’t have money to fill my tank? I’ll go out with my boyfriend, but I wont go out alone. I’m scared to even go to the grocery store alone. I’ve isolated myself from my old friends too. I didn’t mean to but the thought of having a conversation tired me. Then after its been a while I get embarrassed that I had t responded and scared to respond or even start a new conversation. I desperately want social interaction, to play D&amp;D or MTG or just to talk to someone again, but I’m scared. I’ve never been much of a people person, strangers exhaust me, and I’m terribly awkward. I don’t know how to start a conversation or how to carry one. Right now, with how little energy I have, the thought of trying to make a new friend terrifies me.

Because I never leave the house, and the house is messy, I feel like my roommates and practically everyone around me are annoyed by me. I feel like a bum. I feel lazy, like I’m just mooching off of people.  Also, even though I am lonely, I feel like I don’t have the right to have people over. The one good friend I have left from back home has wanted to come and spend the weekend. Now that I think about it, it really sounds silly, but I don’t feel like I should have someone over if I don’t have a job or, if I am unemployed, the house is clean. Also anything we would feed her would have been bought by people other than me. She is my guest and my responsibility..

My grandmother has been helping me with rent until I get my school reimbursement, and she’s been helping my boyfriend and I with groceries, and she’s been helping me not only figure out, but also pay my medical bills. I feel terrible having to depend on her again, let alone how heavily I’m depending on her. I’m supposed to be out of the house and on my own...

I still have contact with my grandmother, but it seems she’s been annoying me more than anything lately. She’s always been a little overbearing, she just doesn’t want to push me to do things I’m not ready for yet. Lately she’s constantly calling every five minutes either to just talk, or to remind me about things I have to do. Don’t get me wrong, I’m so grateful for everything she’s doing to help me and I love her to death, but I cant focus on bills and W2s all the time...I need to take some time to de-stress (something I’m terrible at). Regardless of how annoyed I may get with her, I truly miss her greatly, but I’m afraid of driving right now and I don’t want to put up with my grandfather reminding me about how jobless I am.

I have been applying to jobs, but I’m just doubting myself. I’m afraid of not being able to work a ‘regular’ job, I know I’m still not capable of standing and/or walking for eight hours. I also don’t want to mentally/emotionally overwork myself like I did the last time. I’ve been applying to remote, freelance writer, librarian, doggie daycare, book retail, receptionist, and other similar jobs, but no one wants me. I have lots of skills, just no paperwork to back me up.

I’ve tried doing my own thing to make money. I have a lot of hobbies, sewing and baking/cooking being a mere fraction of them. My grandmother encouraged and helped me explore anything we could get our hands on. I’ve tried opening an etsy to sell chokers I’ve sewn, worked on the shop for weeks to get the listings as professional as I could make them, spent months advertising it, and over a hundred dollars on materials for perspective orders. In all that time I only had a single view on my shop. One person looked at it. Thats it.
I’ve tried other ventures, with the same amount of effort, and the same result. Failure.
I would absolutely love to be my own boss and create something I’m proud of for a customer, but any time I try I get nothing. No one is even interested in me. I’ve given up, believing that any market I try to get into has already been saturated.

Additionally, I have a big doctors appointment soon. This is the one to tell me if the original blood disorder test is a true positive or not. To tell me whether or not I have to be on warfarin for the rest of my life.
If its positive I dont know what I’ll do. I know I’ll be a wreck. 

I know my boyfriend is a godsend for putting up with me. Not only does he put up with me, but he enjoys it. He loves spending time with me, even if its just laying in bed playing video games, or debating which answer it is on my classwork. I don’t know what I dod to deserve him, but he has been whats keeping me together these past several months.
My grandmother too. I honestly would not be alive to have had any of this if it weren’t for her. She took me in and helped me grow into my own person during the darkest time in my life. I don’t know what I would have done without her.
Knowing this, knowing that I have a support system, I’m still just....depressed. I honestly wonder sometimes if the stroke Should have taken me...

Overall, I’m just really depressed, lacking motivation, very anxious, scared, and lonely. I feel like a failure, and a lazy bum. I don’t really know what to do. I’m still in autopilot mode from the hospital and trying to process what happened. 
I’m struggling to readjust back into normal life...just everything is overwhelming and happening all at once, but if I slow down and handle one or two things at a time I feel guilty that I’m not doing enough."
1420,"My mum told me to sign myself off the waiting list for therapy because there are ""people who need it more""","Just frustrated.

Been on a waiting list for CAT for 2 years now. Been given yet another ""assessment"", basically they have no slots available so they keep us on assessments in the meantime.

Vented my frustration to my mum about the waiting lists and she was like ""do you really *need* therapy? You should sign yourself off the waiting list so someone who actually needs it can have it.""

I'm pretty upset because I just feel super invalidated. I don't know how to explain that having surface level happiness, being functional, having friends and a relationship etc doesn't fix my mental health problems. But now I feel guilty, like I'm playing the victim and wasting mental health resources that could be put to better use.

Sorry for the rant, just feeling a bit hopeless."

I'm ready to walk out and quit my god damn job to get rid of it. There are no suggestion boxes. I asked them last week to please stop playing kids bop, but fuck me right? It doesn't take a damn week to change one part of the radio schedule here. It fucking can't. I mean jesus fuck why!? HOW THE FUCK COULD THEY HAVE THOUGHT MAKING US LISTEN TO THIS MOTHERFUCKING PEDOPHILE SHIT WOULD EVER BE A GOOD IDEA!? WHO THE FUCK DO THESE PEOPLE THINK THEY ARE!? Fuck this place.

1422,Mild heat stroke related to poor mental health,"Some advice would be nice

Suffered a mild heat stroke in 2007 deployed in Kuwait. I was young and felt invincible and didn’t drink enough water. It fucked me up for the next ten years. I was fraud to go out in the sun and let’s just say any physical activity because anxiety inducing and I felt the same feelings from when I had the heat incident before because all I kept think of was getting dehydrated again. After awhile my body has slowly gotten better and my mind me tally stronger. But I still get dizzy or that anxiety feeling sometimes when I try to start working out. I have no trouble going outside and sweating or doing manual labor in the heat but for some reason trying to physically work out kicks that 2007 incident into overdrive. Has anyone else experienced this and if so how did you overcome it. The mental block is real and so are the physical side effects. What the he’ll can I do to overcome that. Is my body permanently screwed because of this one incident?"
1423,Does anyone feel like they have no place in society?,"I don’t really know how to explain this but I’ll give it my best shot. 

I feel like I have no place in society at all. Kinda like I’ve been invited to a party because the person having the party had to, not because they wanted to. I just don’t seem to connect with anyone, like walking through the street and passing people I don’t know, I feel like I’m bothering people just from walking around.  I just feel I’m meant to be somewhere different, I don’t know where but anywhere but in this world. That’s the vibe I get daily. 

I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense I’m kinda drunk, but I’ve been at this party and I’ve been sitting by myself and this is all I’ve been thinking about so I guess I’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar."
1424,In a few months I could possibly be homeless...and I’m not sure what to do,"It’s been a rough time I guess. For the last two years now I guess, I have been moving every 2-6 months for various reasons. It’s a very long story. Anyways the last 8 something months (a record) I’ve been living with my bf and his family. Lately things have kinda hit the wall and just got an overwhelming feeling things could be over soon. I moved in too soon (due to living situation) and now realising I have fucked myself...

Anyways anyone know of any places in the Uk that help people in my situation? Got no where else to go and got two reptiles. Just want to be prepared in case the worse happens."
1425,Social media &amp; mental health. Discussion.,"Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking more lately about social media and it’s effects on our daily life, it became so ingrained in our mind that some people don’t know the difference between real life and social media, do you think a person should hop off social media and focus on their reality?,  or you think it is a tool and we just need to learn more how to use it not abuse it for the sake of our mental health?"
1426,What do you do on a good day?,"Long ass post: unloading a little

TLDR: Title


We have our dark days, and we all know what that can feel like, when that Big black dog sits on our shoulder. 

He becomes a friend after a while. He can keep you down, or be used as a tool to temper expectations, and become armour. 

I normally have a Husky who keeps him away, most of the time. Today she is away (doggy day care, -she fucking loves it; -it’s basically play-school for dogs), so I don’t have her support. 

But what about when the Big black dog vanishes for a while, because of external events?

Today I had some excellent news. After being out of work for nearly 2 months the negativity has been following me closer and closer, and new its had cause to lift, and I’m scared it’s temporary.

Today I heard back from a job I want; that pays very well; is practically on my doorstep; and the employers are *very* interested in me based off my CV *alone*. In the interview, I’ll get to smash it by explaining the engineering experience I have with relevant equipment systems. 

So far so good, but There’s that gnawing at the back of my mind that says: “Don’t be too happy; then you don’t get hurt”

Since coming out of the army with a medical discharge, things have been hard. Civilian life is...

different. 

And the army doesn’t teach you how to go back to the real world. Even when it has been 1/3rd of your life. Seeing friends with body parts missing, kinda sticks, regardless of the services you get to deal with it. 

I’ve learnt to analyse, and was given some tools to deal and cope, and they work best if you stay level. 

Calm and collected under pressure, would be a massive strength I have. An example; I’ve SCUBA dived for fun for years, traveled the world seeing the most unbelievable shit, and had the biggest emergencies thrown at me without being phased. 

Once I pulled panicked divers back to dry land textbook style, with 30m of unbreathable water above me, and a boat miles away in a fast drift current; and not bat an eyelid at any of it.
The most calm moments I’ve known in my life, were during the most dangerous moments of it. Solo diving was near zen like, and it’s arguably the most dangerous diving out there. You are 100% reliant on equipment, regardless of how well trained you are, and as an engineer I very well know, failures can happen at any time spontaneously, because of things you can’t even see. 

I can usually recognise and deal well with dark days and thoughts, even meditating occasionally. I try to recognise negativity in my thoughts or feelings, and calm myself during panic-esq 
I practice mindfulness of my actions and words, and I don’t rock the boat. 

But good days scare me. When things look good, and a positive path is laid out for you...

It feels like a trap

1428,Sleep disturbance and mental health,
1429,from one side of the spectrum to another,"so this is my first post, I'm kinda new to reddit so if this is the wrong place to ask this I apologize. 

I've bee in therapy for a few years, mainly for depression but it's about to end soon and I do feel quite stable and ready to stay on my own feet and be confident. 
I've been reading about Carl Jungs theories lately and a lot of it makes sense to me and I try to apply what he says in my inner and outer world, which helps me be very aware of myself.
But it has come to a point where I'm not sure how healthy it is. Like I said in the title I feel like I'm switching sides a lot, like almost going from one extreme to another. that mostly applies to fields of interest (but also and definitely for interpersonal relationships). for a few weeks I'll be completely obsessed with art and music, after that it'll be video games and then something new that I've never tried before like coding and than back to art and music for example. Whenever I shift between these fields I feel like a different person and completely distant from that other side of the spectrum, almost as if that means nothing to me anymore but I know I'll eventually switch back to that side and be completely in love with it again. 
My therapist told me that I have minor symptoms of borderline (i.e. unclear or shifting self image) and I'm always aware of those shifts and situations in which my feelings feel like they're pulled or stretched in two opposite directions. there's so much contradiction going on inside that it feels like my body can't stand this excessive amount of negative energy. It's not like I'm switching personalities but to a degree I identify with the things I love and do (my fields of interest, like most people I guess) so when I'm turning away from one side of the spectrum I feel like I'm distant from a certain part of me. 
I've been thinking for the longest time how to make peace with all of it and not feel like I'm abandoning a part of me, even if it's temporarily. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense I just really don't know what to do and hope to find people who maybe feel the same and exchange methods of coping with it."

He was homeless for the past week - living in ERs.
 The hospital, they are refusing to admit him for psych, saying he’s not manic. They agreed to admit him on the medical floor and The social worker is working with us to find him a place to live. Another assisted living facility or nursing home.
My dad is belligerent and being a toddler and tantruming saying he doesn’t want his freedom taken away and he will not go to a nursing home...If he refuses the facility they offer where do we stand he cannot live with family I cannot take care of him I have small children!"
1433,Very specific question (re: cats),"Hey all,

This is an oddly specific question, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I live with my girlfriend, and we both want to get a cat. She's a huge animal person so she's already on board, but I'm hesitant because of my depression, anxiety, and OCD tendencies. 

I'll explain: My main trigger typically is clutter and messes. If the house is dirty, I'll stress over it, which turns to anxiety, which turns to depression -- that's a typical loop. 

My question is whether getting a cat in the house will help my depression and anxiety (because I do want one), or will it make things worse because it's another thing I have to put time and energy into (and another source for clutter). If all goes well, however, having one around could also lift my spirits I'm thinking. 

Cat owners and/or people with a similar ailment, what do you think?"
1434,"Feeling ""soulless"", ""heartless"", so to speak","I spent a few hours alone last night just thinking about myself.

While I do think I suffer from borderline personality disorder and NPD, it has been brought to my attention that I might have antisocial personality disorder. When I stopped to think about it last night, it made more sense to me that I might have some tendencies. And as much as I might be tempted to say this bothers me, the idea of having ASPD doesn't bother me. BPD does, but not ASPD. It's kinda liberating. But some things don't match...or they kinda do. I don't know.

As for the typical aspects of ASPD: I've been violent towards close people before, without feeling regret. I've reconciled with them and they believe I regret hurting them, but I really don't. I tend to impulsively break rules they bore me. In school, trying to follow the rules was difficult. But I didn't violate serious rights too often, so that doesn't exactly match ASPD.

I have always denied the idea of having ASPD because I feel like I fear rejection too much...but I noticed I react to rejection the same way I do when my lies don't work as they were supposed to. I feel the need to have a romantic partner because I want to build something sort of like an ""empire."" I guess that suits NPD. I have never cared for a single partner's needs. I haven't had any serious relationships, but whatever. I just don't care about what happens to people. Their achievements are meaningless to me, unless I believe I can benefit from them. I've befriended people in order to get favors. I pretend to care about them fairly well, I think.

I also tend to lie for my own enjoyment. I have pretended to be another person just for fun on several occasions.

Not asking for a diagnosis. Does anybody have any information that might be useful to me?"
1435,Why do I get so anxious when people start to like me. I start to feel suffocated as soon as anyone starts talking to me in a non-platonic way,
1436,I just really wanna beat someone up because I find it amusing and get's out steam.,"There something wrong with me I just really wanna hurt someone because I feel pleasure from doing it and to get out my aggression.

Doesn't matter who they are I wanna hurt them on so many levels and can't stop thinking about in my head also don't feel empathy towards these people. Even if they died it would be disappointed.

I mostly like this at stressful time but even at okay times I still feel like this."
1437,My family doesn't talk to me,"I have fought with depression for a few years but I have never tried to let that put me down, I was fighting day by day to be out there as much as I possibly could. I had better times, I had worse times, but I still fought. I got to see a therapist recently for only a few times because my depression had gotten very bad and talking to her helped me a lot, although right before evolving, my parents cut off the sessions because I didn't ""change"" as they wanted me to. They straight up told me the sessions were to see if I could be diferent that the person I am now, not because of my ""sadness"". I've gotten so used to these kinds of comments that I hadn't realized how unhealthy they are. My family is toxic, like really bad. I don't remember a single day in the last ten years where my mother wasn't complaining about virtually anything. She's a bully that has created an unhealthy enviorment and she should have gone to a therapist herself like yesterday. But she didn't and now we all have to pay for her own traumas (her family was equally toxic).

Anyway I recently heard my mother complain about me being too ""confused"" about life and how she wasn't proud of me. That was when I was feeling down. I didn't eat anything for an entire day, nor did I speak to anyone else for the rest of it. My family didn't care, not even a single ""Hey, how are you doing?"" for the last week or so. They don't talk to me and I don't want to talk to them. They only talk to me to either hurt me or ask me unavoidable questions. I feel isolated and broken. My friends don't care either but they are friends whom I don't expect anything from anyway, my family hurts a little bit more. I can't sleep and I have had very toxic thoughts lately. Help"
1438,Social anxiety,"Hello , I am 19 years old and I think I have social anxiety. 

I feel nervous in the university, I regret most of the things I say wether they’re right or wrong. 

Sometimes I feel people judge me , I keep wondering what do they think about me , and this social anxiety comes as episodes every once and a while.


Can anyone help ? It’s really depressing .

Also I don’t think a therapist is an option this period for me cause it’s a bit expensive"
1439,I am once again asking for your mental health knowledge,"So, just for context: I've been diagnosed with BPD and I'm going to therapy. 

I've just realized my lack of motivation and how easy it is to make me give up on the things I want when it ""involves"" other people.
For example: if I really want to go to a restaurant with someone, but for some small reason they tell me they are too lazy to go so I give up on that. Or if I really want to order idk hamburgers for dinner at home with my family, and my brother says he wants something else, I'll give up on the hamburgers. Or if I say that I want to watch a movie with my family, however they forget about it, I won't remind them. 
(This happens more with my family than with my friends, but it still bothers me bc I feel like it makes me feel distant from them)
And, sure I could argue with them saying that I'll go to the restaurant anyways or that I'll order a hamburger to myself. I could remind them of the movie I wanted to watch with them, but, to me, it wouldn't be fun since they didn't choose to participate that's why I give up on these things. 

Why does that happen? Is it normal? Does it have a name? What should I do about it?

PS: I didn't talk to my psychologist about this yet, and since she's on a break it'll take a little bit long to know her answers."
1440,I'm scared,"I'm going home from dorm today and I don't know what's happening

Let's start from the begging

Yesterday my grandmother called if I'll come to her when I'll come back and as I'm an idiot that can't say no, no mater how many times I have been hurt. So I was planning to go alone, but my father was going to pick me up today later from train and I didn't want to go with him to talk to her, as he with smile on his face lied about me and she wanted to scold me, but my sister stopped her. That was the last safe place taken away.

And as I was thinking about it I became more distracted and too focused on everything at the same time.

I feel disconnected from reality and I don't know what's happening.

I'm going crazy and the next visit to psychologist I have is 2nd of March.

I don't want to talk to any of them. I want them to leave me fucking alone. I'm scared, I don't wanna go back home. 

IM GOING INSANE

I DONT KNOW WHATS HAPPENING"
1441,Is social withdrawal a coping mechanism?,I just think the easiest way not to lose your mind is self isolation. I am too sensitive about what people say. It it okay?
1442,"What do you do when you're doing your best to cry for help, but nobody cares?","I've been lonely for about 7 years now. It's been depressing and has really affected me, but all in all I've been okay. Well I'm not sure what was different this year, but ever since Valentine's Day I have been in a deep depression, walking through every day on the verge of tears, just putting on a happy face. Well I have a few important people in my life who I talk to about anything (but I usually don't because I bottle things in. Not healthy but is what it is.) So I've tried talking to them about how I'm feeling, but they don't seem to care. They're on their phone only half paying attention to what I'm saying even though I asked them to come over to talk. I'm putting as many red flags out as my closed-off self can figure out how to. I'm not suicidal, I'm not going to hurt myself, but that doesn't mean I don't need someone. And for the record, I do have a therapist, but I can't go too often because my insurance isn't great. I go about once a month. But all the time between is where I need someone. I know and have accepted that I can't do this alone. But nobody cares."
1443,My life has gone to shit,"I feel like I’m living in a different time zone than everyone else. My eating and sleep schedule has been so messed up. I don’t fall asleep until 3:00 or 4:00 each night, and I wake up late everyday around 7:20 (I leave the house at 7:45). I never eat breakfast or lunch except coffee and a few pieces of fruit. Around 4:00 pm I binge eat an unhealthy amount of food. Some days I don’t eat at all. I feel guilty after I eat and I want to starve myself the next day. Sometimes I do and sometimes I fail. I’m always napping in class and lately my grades have been suffering. I feel bad and cry everyday. I just want to restart my life or something."
1444,I want people to notice,"I want people to notice just how not okay I am. But I can't tell them because I don't want to be a burden.
My parents and friends all generally know I'm not okay. My mum walked in on my crying alone in my room and tried to talk to me. I told her a few things but I don't know how to express myself vocally very well. It happens often enough that when she does see me I just tell her I'm fine, I can deal with it, so go away.
Obviously I am not fine, cannot deal with it, and desperately want her to stay. But I know it's a lot to have to deal with and I don't want to burden anyone.
But nights like tonight, after having a horrible day at work and at home, and after a month of feeling terrible constantly, I really needed her to notice. But everytime I get quiet and don't answer people's questions, she assumes I'm just pissed off and in a bad mood.

Is there anyway to have someone notice? Or am I doomed to continue like this as there is no way I am going to approach her."
1445,I say I'm pretty good. But I'm not good.,"Last month I really started taking step to focus on my mental and physical health. I started using talk space, working less and walking more. I also moved out of my mom's house. I have a lot of psychological trauma. Nothing too intense but over the years it has definitely shaped me as a person. I have a lot of doubts and stress about if I'm doing and saying the right thing.

I'm having a hard time talking to my therapist about it all.

The catalyst for me to move out was an incident with my mom. My dad passed away in November right before Thanksgiving. I was worried about my mom losing the house to my dad's divorce lawyer. I was working 50 hours a week and getting chewed out by my GM for not getting work done. And I was stressed beyond belief. I was having panic attacks and according to my fitbit my resting heart rate was in the 80s. I had tried to talk to my mom but she blew me off and made every conversation about her. So it got to the point where I just shut down. She confronted me in the kitchen one morning and asked me what was wrong. I first told her nothing and brushed her off. But when she pushed I told her I was extremely stressed out. She asked me about what and I told her everything. Life. She said I was ungrateful and that there are a lot of people with things a lot worse than me.

That last sentence has defined my life. I don't complain about anything. I put up with whatever life throws at me because I know it could be worse and I honestly do not take anything I have for granted. I appreciate all my opportunities and experiences. However, I still get stressed. I worry about doing the right thing and making sure everything is taken care of.

My therapist checks in with me weekly and generally I am managing. But I have a hard time telling someone details about things when they don't ask specific questions about what's going on. If you've ever seen the show Patriot on Amazon the lead guy John has a lot of shit he is dealing with and when someone asks how he's doing he just says pretty good. And he absolutely really is not good. That's how I feel."

My mind is telling me it's because I've become lazy and something within me has changed. I feel like I'll never achieve anything again. I'm incapable of focusing on anything these days and waste all my time on useless crap.

The worst part is being scared that this is permanent. That this is me as a person. That all of this is happening just because I'm just useless and lazy."
1449,Helpppp pleaseeee,"Ok so I’m at college doing vet nursing and I love it, its what I’ve always wanted to do so why do I still feel so shit? At the start of the year I pretended to be ok because I thought after a while I wouldn’t have to pretend anymore, I did this for a few weeks and then shit started happening again at home and I gave up trying to pretend to be ok. A couple of my lecturers noticed the bruising and asked me if I was ok, obviously I made stuff up and said I just fell over/fell off my horse. I told one of my best friends at college because I trusted her not to tell anyone but one of my lecturers was walking behind us and I didn’t realise and she told the safeguarding lead and I had to go and sit in her office for hours and it was awful, I hated it. Anyway so now I’m pretending to be ok again because I don’t want anyone high up getting involved but I’m feeling so horrible and suicidal again and I really want to tell one of my lecturers that I trust but I don’t know how to start or what to say and I’m scared that she’ll tell someone higher up and it’ll get back to my mum and everything will just get worse so now I really don’t know what to do, I’m running out of options and truthfully I really just want to die so everything will stop, I just want it to stop hurting :("

1453,What have I become?,"Last night, I was listening to music and suddenly I remembered an old memory and the next thing I know, I’m this emotional wreck, shaking like crazy, sitting up on my desk with my legs covered in blood. Why am I like this? Why did I have to relapse like this? Why can’t I just get better?"
1454,"I don't know how to handle my friends problems, I need help!","Throwaway account on the off chance the person finds my actual account. 
My friend has borderline personality disorder, she's a lovely person with a huge heart. Problem is, I am at the end of my tether with the support I can offer. 
I made some clear boundaries with her in saying that I can't help her with her suicidal gestures. I'm always more than happy to listen, offer advice, comfort or console her but I made it clear that I personally can't handle ambiguous texts of threatening suicide when her symptoms flare up and she splits on me. I don't take it personally, I understand that she has a very severe form of her illness and her symptoms are very difficult to manage. I know that her distress is very real. I wish there was a way to lessen what she deals with. She has been in therapy for years and she has a crisis team. 
I've told her if she's worried about her safety she needs to call for help, of course I am still there to support her throughout that, before that and after that kind of call. For the past two months though she has messaged me ambigious texts that are extremely anxiety inducing every single night bar maybe a day here or there. All relating to how she has hurt herself or is going to, random messages just saying ""goodbye"" or ""something bad happened things are worse"" and then dead silence for a day or two. She doesn't have family and all of her other friends have left because they couldn't handle it either. I feel so bad for her and I don't want anything bad to happen but I just can't cope with feeling like I have to spend every day of my life talking her down from something to the point that I cant have plans because I feel guilty not answering my phone. 
I have told her a couple times that I need space for my own mental health and she's agreed but the second I'm back it's all just backlogged distress. It's been a few days now since I've replied because I can't do it but now I'm insanely anxious about being on my phone, dreading the next text. I've done everything I can do to help but it feels like she wants me to drop everything Im doing then and there to physically go over and stop her from doing something. I can't and I don't know what to do. I've already expressed my feelings on this in the most sensitive way I could, she agreed and apologised but it all gets thrown out the window. If anyone knows any way I can try to resolve this please help, I will be grateful for all and any advice."
1455,"No one cares about my mental health, so why should I?","Lately I have been having weird nightmares that pull me out my sleep and I don’t know why. It reminds me more and more of how I don’t know how to address my mental issues I didn’t think I had.

After waking up this morning and feeling tricked by my GF to put gas in her car at 5am I threw on clothes and went straight to work to just sit in my car and feel like I wanted to cry(I  cant remember the last time I actually cried, but they all feel like failed attempts) So I just sat there dirty, emotional, listing to music with watery eyes hating myself for a hour then walked into work.

I’m going through this weird point in my life where I’m tired of trying to communicate that something might be internally wrong with me because no one care. Not friends, not my mother, not people I’m close to. I say I’m battling something and they look at me like I’m crazy. Like I’m strong enough to stop complaining and keep it to myself.

I sat in the car after work today thinking if I killed myself, I would feel horrible because I need to be financially free- which is confusing the hell out of me of why would either be on my mind. Oh,because thats me worried about others who don’t worry about me.

I have really been working hard to help myself and I think it’s making things worst. I hate everything about myself and think there is no value I can offer. I have had several surgeries to maybe fix myself. I make 99k a year, I got lasik, gum contouring, zoom whitening, I do cardio in the morning and lift at night, I work myself to death on work projects to try to exhaust my brain, but the harder I work the more I feel like crap. The more I feel tired enough to sleep but scared enough of what I’ll think of in my sleep.

Maybe it’s my past and bad decision coming back to subconsciously haunt me to my grave which really bothers me because I know there is no safe place for me to share things that haunt me. Things that I have done that make my stomach turn. 

Either way this seemed like a good channel to share how I feel right now"
1456,Getting Diagnosis Reconsidered,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II and ADHD when I was 23 years old. When I was 39 my diagnosis was changed to Bipolar I and CPTSD. I am now 42 years old. I have tried many medications over the years, but 10 years ago I began taking lithium and I have met success in taking lithium and a stimulant every day for the past decade. These medications didn't stop me from cycling, but they did lesson the symptoms. 

Three years ago the secret of my childhood sexual abuse came to light in a very public way. My abuse was by my elder brother, who is 20 years older than I am, and my brother was continuing to behave inappropriately towards me, even as an adult. When my brother's own family fell apart under abuse allegations, my secret became known and we've been engaged in a 3 year long court battle that has made the front page of local newspapers and has destroyed my family. During that time my elderly father died, and my mother took ill and I became her primary caregiver. 

During this process I was forced to face my ultimate fear; the disclosure of my family secret and the dismantling of my family. I faced that fear, as well as many other challenges over the past three years, and I did so with grace. I recognized finally that I held the power to control my life, and that I was far stronger than I'd ever given myself credit for. During this time of interrogations, and legal battles, and determining what to do with the remaining pieces of my biological family while caring for and raising my own family, I read a ton of books. I spent a lot of time decoding everything that had happened. 

Here's something I know. Over the past 3 years, when EVERYTHING in my world was destroyed and my worst fears became realized, I didn't get depressed. I didn't collapse under the weight. The lack of structure and routine didn't launch me into a tailspin. I was fine. When I felt something, I identified what it was and then moved on. 

I now believe that my diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder is incorrect. I believe that my behavior through the years was a direct correlation to the secret that I was carrying and my constant need to hide what was going on from my family and friends. The shame and guilt that I felt seemed tied to the burden of what I was carrying. I do believe that the CPTSD diagnosis is accurate, but the rest of it I feel is wrong. 

I had been a person in the past that was suicidally depressed for years because I felt ashamed and worthless and incapable of keeping my life together. It seems to me that everything falling apart should have made things worse, but it didn't. It had the total opposite effect on me. 

When I try to mention it to my doctor I'm always brushed aside. Nobody wants to believe the person labeled 'mentally ill' when they say that they're not actually. It seems impossible to shake a mental health diagnosis once it's received. 

How can someone get their diagnosis reconsidered? I live in a rural part of New York State."
1457,Off of my antipsychotics for a week and its... okay.,"My doctor had me take a week fast off of my antipsychotics (cold turkey) while I switch from Geodon to Abilify. Though I'm doing alright coping with the physical symptoms like the shakes, barely sleeping,  headaches, stomach aches, etc. I am having a difficult time coping with intrusive suicidal thoughts, constant anxiety, obsessive/compulsive actions, and mild hallucinations. I can't hold an attention span long enough to distract myself with netflix/youtube and am too anxious to play music or do something creative. I am really worried this week off is going to to set back my months of progress and seven months of sobriety. Any tips to survive the week?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, any reviews of abilify? especially if you tried geodon before?"
1458,It hurts so bad.," No matter what I do I can't make any friends and can't get anyone to be attached to me. I've been blessed with semi-decent looks, but my sheer awkwardness and literal autism makes me terrible at socialising.

Making this all worse is that I live with toxic parents.

My university class had an after exams party organised. I prepared 2 weeks in advance for this party and even bought a new outfit cause it would only be my second time drinking in my life. And then, today, 3 hours before the party was supposed to happen, everyone collectively decided to just not go. Some were staying home for the weekend, but most were hanging out with their little groups of friends.

I tried hinting and probing that I'd like to join, but there's only so much you can do with that unless you become intrusive. No one invited me to anything. So I bought my outfit for nothing, was stressing about the party nothing, was looking forward to the party for nothing, and got myself dressed and worked hard on makeup for nothing.

What's worse is that my parents were under the impression that I had a decent social life. From the start of the school year I faked hangouts so they wouldn't keep mocking me as an antisocial, stupid freak and all the insults you can think of, so at least I could concentrate on my studies better. And now all that effort, those lies have come crashing down.

I'm back to square zero. Nothing I do ever gets me anywhere. All the therapy sessions to work on myself and gradually make friends is useless. I wish someday I could work up the courage to just kill myself."
1459,I Fucked up,"I'm not even 19 and i have already been on a year of antidepressants and therpy. Last year was very bad for me and i just wanted to kill myself. I somehow talked to my parents and got help. Start of this year was good i felt good i didn't want to kill myself i had a good routine i was even working out. 
I started talking to my crush it was really nice and it really helped me out of those thoughts. And now i think i Fucked up any chance of relationship i had with her. I said too much when i shouldn't have said anything. 

Now i want to die but i don't want to kill myself.

I thought this would be a nice place to talk to people."
1460,A disastrous consequence spreading like a virus.,"I was recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. It was traced back to some traumatic experience which i had experienced which resulted in a series of events which caused harm to my near and dear ultimately causing a great sense of guilt. They feel of guilt increases as they are not aware of it. This sense of guilt has completely isolated me. I cannot face people anymore, I cannot love or confess my feelings to anyone. This inability to express have made me more reserved and in order to vent out such strong emotions, it has lead to self-harm which really helps. 
The society i live in knows my situation and it’s really embarrassing as i am always treated like someone who should be empathised with. This is wrong. I don’t want that. I do not want any attention. I wish I could change my identity and start fresh. This current life is messed up. To be precise, i have messed it up and don’t wish to proceed any further because it’s beyond repair. I’ve tried to end this life but simply didn’t have the courage to do so. It’s difficult. 
I bring this up in this community so that i can get a proper response. I don’t even know what i am seeking out. I don’t even know if this post will be accepted but i just write this as i am stuck in this vast ocean. Please. Please help me out. There are many such circumstances which I haven’t typed and I don’t wish to. I might do that if necessary."
1461,How do I get back to having dreams and goals?,"I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit to ask something like this.
Years ago, when I was about to start college, I had some growing doubt and worry about the future and what was the meaning/value of it.  Most everyone assured me that once I started taking classes, I was going to figure things out.  Instead, it lead to more stagnancy, procrastination, regret about both of those things, some weird forms of self punishment like sleep deprivation, and all accumulating to a 1.5ish year period that I was contemplating/idealizing suicide everyday.  At any given minute during the day, I was most likely mentally planning my death or drafting a suicide letter to my family.
I have since left school, worked, and just made myself feel a little more human everyday.  I'd like to think I've come a long way and can't see myself as that person anymore.  But now the future looks open, and I can't seem to pin what I even value anymore.  I feel like I was stripped down of everything I had even an inkling of wanting.
What do I need to decide from myself to get back to living?"
1462,Why doesn’t any politician or anybody with a platform ever address mental illness??,"

It’s the same cycle over and over again. Talking about the gap between the rich and poor. Unemployment, and drugs and the war on terror. But their is a war going on that’s a silent killer known as depression. Everybody says take these pills, exercise or eat better and it should help you. But the truth is you can do all of that and still feel a void in your life. I’ve always wondered why nobody with any platform ever addresses it. It seems to be brushed off as “he or she could have done something different to change their perspective on life” but the truth is some people can’t, and people that have never dealt with depression it seems show a lack of sympathy or remorse to people who are battling the thought of ending it all. I believe some people do not want to end their lives they just want the overwhelming feeling of sadness to stop. It’s a pretty big epidemic and yet it really doesn’t ever get addressed. Why?"
1463,Does anyone know what I am experiencing?,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or knows what is up with my body..

A few years ago I was following a lot of classes in university. One of them was a class I had to retake because I failed the year before. So basically, I was terrified of failing again and very stressed which caused me to have some kind of 'panic attack'. However, it was not a real 'panic attack' as I wasnt sweating, hyperventilating, or anything like that. More so it was a sudden feeling of uneasyness that made me feel like I was stuck in my head/zoning out. The feeling also reminds me of deja vu, as during the 'attack' I am thinking of the most random things and tasting weird tastes as well, that I feel like I have experienced before (however I clearly haven't, neither can I recall any of those things after the attack). I also feel a weird tingling over my body and I need to sit down. It's in general a very scary feeling.

Sorry for this unclear explanation, I find the feeling very hard to describe. It is very unpleasant, and the first time it happened I did start panicking a bit because it was scary. At the time, I thought it must have been the stress. However, I just randomly had another one of the attacks on the bus ride home (have not had any for over two years) and again just now. I am not particularly stressed at the moment..

Does anyone have any clue what this might be? I also don't feel like I can relate to what the internet says about derealization/depersonalization."
1464,Hatred,"I hate everything and myself. I'm incapable of changing, and every damn job under the sun is nearly impossible for me to manage. I just want to die, but I cant even do that. I cant get a gun. I cant figure out how to tie a noose. I cannot live. I cannot die. Life itself is just a prison for me. Nothing will change this"
1465,Why in the world is the company Better Help sharing your Online Therapy Data With Facebook?,"I just finished reading this article, ""[The Spooky, Loosely Regulated World of Online Therapy](https://jezebel.com/the-spooky-loosely-regulated-world-of-online-therapy-1841791137)"" on Jezebel. Turns out Better Help shares all kinds of personal data including data on your therapy sessions with companies like Facebook. When asked they brushed it off as standard practice. Seems like Better Help is very happy to monetize vulnerability while acting like it cares. Just a word of caution: Many of these mental health apps have dodgy privacy policies and are usually founded by people that have no business running a healthcare business let alone a vulnerable space like mental health. They have very cynical views or privacy laws and everything is a monetizable activity even sharing your innermost feelings that you might not even share with your family. Caveat Emptor!"
1466,"I’m so miserable in life I want to run away, leave everything behind and finally be happy","Hello, I’m Hannah. I hate my life. So much, i tried to work past it with medications and therapy but I’m still just a depressed as before. I’d rather not give my real age, but I’m under 18. So I still live with my parents. 

They’re not good parents, they have issues with drugs so it does make my home life stressful. We do not have much money. So we have a lot of financial stress too. I’m in a dead end relationship, I broke up with him before but we are together again somewhat. I’m not happy but he pushes me so much to give him another chance. He won’t listen to me.

My life feels repetitive and pointless. My dreams for the future and my family are the only thing keeping me from killing myself. School has become a chore, so has showering, cleaning, and getting out of bed. I dream of leaving home, and this whole life behind. Living in a cottage all by myself with a bunch of dogs and cats, and a ferret named Marvin. I dream how I’d go to farmers markets on the weekend and baking stuff for my neighbors. Just living my life happily. 

This extremely detailed fantasy of my perfect life makes my current life dull in comparison. I can’t be happy for some reason. Everyday feels the same. Once I turn 18 I hope I’ll have enough money saved from my job that I can go start a new life, I know I’ll have to work to get to where I really want to but I don’t know what to do with myself in the meantime. I’m so unhappy. I hate myself, how I look, my life, everything. I just want to runaway and have my own little corner of the world that I can be alone and happy. 

This is more of a rant then anything."
1467,I’m not sure...,"So my partner also struggles from issues with his mental health. Today though he’s snapped at me for my compulsions and stimming he’s mad about my communication breakdown but if my insomnia is an issue he’ll brush me off while he wakes me daily to coax him back to sleep because of nightmares. I’m legitimately torn about if he’s really capable of being in a relationship with someone like me.

I also can’t shake the thought it’s my fault"
1468,I want to seek help but I'm scared,"I'm scared I'm not actually sick. I'm scared I'm faking my mental health problems and just want attention. I'm scared that once I talk with the therapist they'll go ""well that's just you as a person, you lazy bum"". Sure I'm exaggerating things a bit but I honestly don't think I deserve help. I'm just a shitty person who can't accomplish anything and this is how I am by nature, I'm the one preventing myself from functioning like a normal human being. Right?"

1470,Let's talk Mental Health,"I created this profile on Reddit today, to eventually create my own subreddit. You heard it from me first.

I am a 30 year-old mother of three beautiful little girls I have a wonderful life and I wouldn't trade it for the world now. The last 30 years of my life have been full of trauma. A tough childhood. I became a widow and a single mother in 2012. (Luckily I'm not a single mom anymore and have a wonderful partner). Our backstory of how we met is kind of wild. I'll save that for the next posts on my profile.  

I want to tell my story, no matter how hard it may be for people to head. I need it, I need go purge it. 

Im going to a neuropsychologist in April. Anyone have any info about one of those docs? 
Im hoping it answers questions so I can find the best treatment for me. 

Nice to meet you all 😊"
1471,My Fiancee might have D.I.D,
1472,"[24F] I was having the best day ever. One small thing, and in an instant, I was down in the dumps.","Today, I'd rested enough. Spent time with the family. Exercised. Eaten. Read more than a couple of pages. Found out that I sort of have family in the same city as my penpal, and that the chances of me visiting were higher now than ever before; cried, because I was happy. Sang my lungs out coz no one was home. Danced with the dogs. 

Then, my father walked in with muddy shoes; walked all over the house, went in and out of the bathroom, only making it worse. 

On a normal day, with an outsider, something like this would just irritate me, and I'd respond with a ""I'm not about to clean that up; mop's in the bathroom"" and that's it. But this time, all hell broke loose. I raised my voice, said a few mean things, knocked over the glass on the table, started crying when father walked out, felt taken for granted coz he knew I'd clean up the mess even if he didn't, etc. Then I... began hitting myself because I needed to not be anxious and restless and think negatively about everything that was going on (and other random topics). And I did that, fully aware that I  was making a conscious choice of behaving that way, and that it wouldn't benefit anyone. A few bruises and a lot of tears later, I just grew really quiet, regretting the whole thing. 

I've not resorted to self-harm in forever. I did, back in school, but that was because of the bullying. I'd gotten over it, and it was supposed to be history. Other than that, I'm not violent. I don't ever raise my voice in an argument, or break things. 

As for my history, I've had depression and borderline disassociation in 2019, but a lot has happened after that which could've caused a relapse, but none of it did. I'm embarrassed  to talk to anyone about this, because I'm usually the Listener and the mature friend who has the mental stability to counsel others in the worst situations. Or so my friends think. 

Right now, my mind feels anxious. Restless. Down. I'm constantly seeing the negatives. Despite knowing that in actuality I have many things to be grateful for, a family who cares, a faith that assures me of a God who loves me (non-religious people — I'm just talking my mind here, not forcing my views on anyone else. Apologies for the offense). 

It's late. I'm still crying. I have work in the morning. And I can't seem to understand how I can think in parallels - focusing on the negatives and feeling like shiet, while fully being aware of how I'm feeling/behaving right now. I don't really know where to go from here; possibly sit this episode out. Or think about what exactly made me react in order to avoid it in the future. I just hope I can stop worrying about never being able to fully function normally without a nagging fear of some kind of unannounced episode like this repeating itself. 

I apologise for taking so much of your time. But honestly, thank you for reading this."
1473,I keep spacing out...and not remembering things,"I'm not sure if I'm spacing out or disassociating but it has been happening a lot the last few months.  I'll space out for 10 minutes with no recollection of anything said. I'll ask my boyfriend a question and then while hes talking, I check out for the entire response. Ill have no memory of things that happened. Its especially bad while driving. I check out and almost run a red light. Also another time, I was so gone that I didnt even realize I was following the wrong route to work. I have to ask people to repeat themselves so frequently because I wasnt ""there"" for what they said even though I'm looking right at them as though I'm there. It gets worse when I'm stressed. My memory in general has been awful."
1474,I think my ex has a cluster B disorder,"Intro/background

I met my ex on online dating about 6 months ago. We are both lawyers. I thought she was attractive, very smart, confident, bold, and we had a lot in common. However, from the get go I noticed several red flags. She seemed status obsessed (talking about designer clothes, how she went to all these high status events), talked about her previous ""relationships"" a lot and very early on. On the first date she talked about how she dated like 4 other lawyers that year after ending it with her one and only previous bf of 5 years. She actually brought up the guy who she eventually left me for and how he ghosted her when all she wanted to know was why he ended things.  On the second date she brought up how she snuck out in high school to hook up a lot. She gave me the vibe that she got around, but it seemed like maybe she was just a very confident and forward person who was sexually liberated.  The red flags were there, but I thought she seemed to really like me and this might have potential, and I didnt want to throw something away because I was being judgemental.

Beginning of the relationship

We keep dating casually, eventually sleep together a few times. About a month after we started dating she kind of freaks out and texts me  so do you actually like me?? And I was like uh yeah of course? I thought it was obvious. And she was like ok well you never told me (not that she ever told me either). Later she revealed she was really considering ending it then because she thought I didnt like her. 

We get exclusive, and gradually but quickly things get more serious. I go from spending a day with her a week to two to three to four nights a week at her place within maybe 3 months of dating her (it was convenient as she lived much closer to my job). I thought it was fast, but it seemed kinda natural ,we got along really well, and I was enjoying spending time with her. She wanted me to meet her parents about two months after I met her. She would tell me I'm the best guy she's ever been with, basically the only ""good guy"" she has been with, and how she loved me and all this stuff. She would make kind of off hand comments about marriage and things. I thought hey she seems like she is head over heels for me and I really like her too. And the sex was great and frequent. Maybe she just had a rough past and never got involved with the right person. I felt like with a little healthy guidance and growth she could be a really great partner.

A Million Red Flags

Well as time goes on I dont stop having this gut feeling that something is off about her. She casually brings up past flings too often and too nonchalantly. She brings up the high school thing a lot. She was very overt and kind of callous about sex (almost exclusively referring to it as 'fucking'). I started hearing about her experiences in her sorority and started to wonder like how much did she really get around? Shes told me of at least 15 partners, without any prompting from me, and hinted at being promiscuous (referred to herself as a whore multiple times). She mentioned she had ""one sketchy hookup"" and freaked out that she got an STD, even though she used protection. I'm not overly judgemental about a number, but I think risky sexual behavior is a biiig warning sign. 

I also noticed that she really has very low self esteem, she admitted she has a fear of being abandoned, she makes very belittling comments about others often, is pretentious, quick to be irritable, and like kind of gives me little insults being ""funny."" I thought she was just teasing/being playful but I think she just did it to hurt my self esteem. She seemed like her biggest motivation was to be high status and have high status people like her. I noticed her social media was very attention seeking and she made these pretentious captions that occasionally would belittle men/relationships, she openly told me she loved attention. I also noticed she had zero long term friends, none at all from high school or college. She also seemed to get texted by her previous guys somewhat often, but would usually act like annoyed by it.

Another odd thing about her is that she was like REALLY into disney stuff. Like her favorite movie was a child's disney movie, and she loved all the disney parks. 

I also noticed almost everyone in her family had a serious mental issue. She took several medications for depression and anxiety since high school ( I kind of took this as hey yeah she has issues, but she has addressed them for a long time so she probably has somewhat resolved them). She had scars from self harm. She obsessed over her appearance and weight and wore tons of makeup if we ever went out. 

She meets my parents eventually. My family is modest, middle class, and extremely close and nice. She did not make a good first impression. After the breakup, my mom told me she felt something was off, but didnt spend too much time with her so she didnt want to be judgemental. My parents usually like girls that I date a lot, so the fact that they werent enthused concerned me. They would say do you actually like her or are you just impressed by her? My mom also said she kind of seemed like and alien or robot trying to act like a human. Like she would think this is what a human would do or say. I think she spoke mostly to make impressions on others and not so much to actually express herself. 

All of these things would weigh on my mind when I wasn't with her, and I found myself getting stressed just thinking about her all the time.

I know it might seem obvious that I should have gotten the f out, but she really did treat me well. She would always listen to me and sometimes give me some quality advice. I remember one thing she told me that I really appreciated was that she could see how I had grown in just the short time we had been together and gave examples. Despite her usual irritable/aggressive nature she was very sweet to me most of the time. And I loved how smart she was.

The breakup

Anyway, I kept trying to see past the red flags, but they after 4 months of exclusivity they are still on my mind quite often.  We hang out last (valentine's) weekend, friday through monday morning. At this point, I've been staying over 4 nights a week for a while, and she has told me I could stay over more often. On valentine's day, one of her presents was a key to her house, it meant a lot to me. We hung out the rest of the weekend and everything was pretty much normal. Anyway, Monday morning comes around and as I'm getting ready for work at her place I just cant stop worrying about my concerns and I eventually kind of break down and tell her that her past, the fact that she talks about her past flings so much, and the way she talks about sex scares me. Surprisingly, she didnt get very upset and actually said yeah those are legitimate concerns, but she understands why I would feel that way and not to worry. I felt a lot better after getting that off my chest.

So I'm texting her Monday and it just feels off. I keep asking if everything is okay or if we're okay and she just cant give me a straight answer, but tries to act like it's cool. Eventually I just directly push for her to tell me what's up, and she says she needs some time to think about things and process things as she has a lot on her mind. I thought it was what I had told her, but she repeatedly said it wasnt anything to do with what I said. At this point I'm just thinking okay shes gonna break it off, and I'm upset. But I give her space. She texts me the next day like oh just trust me, this is for the best, I love you so much  you're the best boyfriend ever and ""I just want to be sure I can give you the love you deserve."" After that I'm like what is all this about?? Are you just not ready for an actual relarionship?Why wont you talk to me or let me know what's wrong at all? Do you think it's acceptable to just let me stew not knowing if you're going to end things or have any idea what you're thinking about?? She sends me back an angry text and kind of tries to make me feel guilty or something, and that she asked for a little space ""politely"" and didnt ""keep me completely in the dark"". I say fine take all the space you need (I almost ended things then and there).

Later that night she texts me hey can you come talk after work tomorrow? I replied if you made a decision please just call me and tell me so I dont have to stew over this for another day. She texts me that she will call me in a few minutes as she is taking a bath (pretty much confirming it's over without saying it). I wait anxiously for 20 minutes until she finally calls.

She sounds very like just calm and cold. No crying. I'm not crying either, I have been coming to terms with it. She says we need to end things, and I ask why. At first she just said I dont think we're long term compatible and gave some really weak example. Eventually she says well if you really wanna know, you knew I had hangups about the last guy I dated and he texted me saturday. So I met up with him yesterday and talked with my friends about it, and they said I should go with him. I just felt a stronger connection with him than I ever felt with you. I would regret not taking a chance on him more than I'd regret ending this. I was trying to reason with her, but was also just angry at this point. After maybe 10 minutes I told her fine it's done, fuck off and hung up. 

Post breakup

Looking back, the way she ended things was dishonest and inconsiderate. Like if she had decided not to pursue him, was she gonna tell me after a few days hey guess what I chose not to leave you for some dude I breifly dated 6 months ago. As if I would be like okay with that. I think she was just making sure she could have him while keeping me as a backup. She would have lied and made it about my doubts or something. And the way she told me she loved me and that I needed to trust her and all this shit while she's considering just leaving me for an ex just sickens me. Andthen how she got mad at me when I just said hey this is kinda bullshit, when she was completely in the wrong. If she had told me she was even considering her ex, I would have dropped her like a sack of bricks. And the whole like can you come over tmr to talk thing. Like she was just gonna let me sit there for a day not knowing what the fuck is up when she knows its over? It makes me think she really lacks empathy. It's crazy to me how she was able to have this really intimate relationship while she was ONE TEXT from ending things. 

After reading about cluster B personality disorders, I now really think she has some combination of histrionic/borderline/narcissism. I think her entire life revolves around her trying to seek external validation as she lacks any self esteem and cannot give herself internal validation.

I dropped the key off at her house yesterday and got my things. When she opened the door she had on a sad face and had her arms open for a hug, I let her hug me but acted pretty indifferent. I just went here's your key, where's my stuff. Is that everything? And then she went do you want to talk? I said no and then just went ""bye"" and left. 

I have strongly considered blocking her number. I'm fairly certain she will crawl back one day and I almost want the satisfaction of seeing it. There is absolutely no chance I get back together with her, ever. I'm honestly glad i never ended it myself, because now I have absolutely no doubts she is not the person for me, and I know to trust my gut.

I have basically convinced myself she has deep issues and that this whole relationship was a facade so she could get validation by getting my (a ""high status"", good looking guy) attention and affection. I dont think she loved me, or is truly capable of love. It takes a lot of the punch out of being dropped out of nowhere for an ex not-even-boyfriend to think this whole thing was not real. The dishonesty she displayed when she was ""processing things"" makes me think EVERYTHING she ever told me was a lie and/or just said to further her own goals.

Questions.

Was any of this relationship real? Did I just kind of make up the person I wanted her to be?

How likely is it this whole relationship was a facade? Do you think maybe she does actually love me but is really unstable/impulsive?

Is the way this ended normal whatsoever?  

Does she actually have a mental disorder?

Was there a ""better connection"" or whatever with her ex, or did she just feel threatened when I expressed concerns?

Do you think her ex actually texted her out of the blue, or do you think she felt threatened by my concerns and decided to end this before I ""abandoned"" her(borderline's worst fear)?

Do you see any way in which she is a relatively healthy person who just had a really strong connection with someone else? And maybe made the right decision for herself?

Did I handle the breakup right?

How do I move past this?

What should I do moving forward? My plan is to completely cut contact and avoid her to the best of my ability.

I'm pretty sure I dodged a bullet, and all my friends and family confirm my feelings. I just wanted to hear more opinions and get confirmation. 

Tl;dr: My now ex got really serious with me quickly, then left me out of the blue for the guy she briefly dated before me. They only dated a little over a month and he completely ghosted her. There were many red flags of mental illness the entire relationship. Looking to see if others think she has a mental disorder or if I just started dating her at the wrong time, and where to go from here."

1476,I need help,"I need help. I dont know what to do. I'll start by by giving some basic info about myself. I'm 18 with a long history of concussions (which has me convinced that I have CTE), have a hyperactive brain, can't find a job because of the shithole city I live in, all my friends have moved away, and have absolutely zero motivation. I feel like a useless hunk of meat. I'm pretty sure I have depression. I have never had suicidal thoughts, but I question why I continue to live. I've had a lack of mental stimulation, which has caused me to not even feel real. I can hardly tell the difference between a dream and real life. I dont feel sad, but I cant remember the last time I felt happy. I just exist. I just go on with my day without any emotional response to the world around me. I sort of live in a bubble. I can't even begin to imagine what would happen to my mind if it bursts. The one thing that overwhelms me the most is my loneliness. I go months on end without hanging out with anyone. Besides my parents, nobody has ever cared for me. Just an afterthought. I dont believe this is possible to change. I feel like I was destined to be a loner. I accept that but I yearn for the feeling of having someone care about me. I want to ask for a therapist but my parents are pissed off with me so I doubt that they would get one for me if I ask. Sorry for the self-pity.  I really wonder why I haven't put a gun to my head yet."
1477,Not sure how to deal with mentally unstable cousin who I am very close to.,"My cousin is 30m and I am 27m. We became very close over the past year. He’s very into all kinds of psychedelics and studies art and religions very seriously. Hes a total hippy. He’s always a very good artist. But he has had a lot of very intense psychedelic experiences, maybe 10 years total and 3-5 of pretty heavy use. He’s experienced god and is very knowledgeable of religions and tries to translate his experiences into a spiritual explanation for himself. His conclusion is his name pronounced Yahweh and he is the voice of god, to the best of my understanding. At the same time of preaching love for everyone and how beautiful life is, he will pretty frequently make Facebook posts saying how should commit suicide for one reason or another. And then all these people tell him how much they love him. He’s obviously hurting and there’s a lot more to this but he just laughs at the idea of a mental health professional diagnosing him in some way. I want to help him but I don’t even know where to start."

1479,I really want to help my grandma but I have no idea how,"So, I'm the minor (well, I'm 17) in the house, but I think she is having some hallucinations or something. She yells all the time at the 'neighbours upstairs' (there are none), nods her head all the time, argues with them in a whisper, basically seems to not hear (and sometimes I am convinced she does not hear based on her responses) what people say to her. What she tells 'them' is heartbreaking. 'You've made me a vegetable, ruined my life, I can't do anything! I can't sleep, eat, or shower without you watching me or bothering me!' She yells at 'them' all the time, threatens to call the police on 'them', they seem to be totally tormenting her. It's horrible. She does take some pills, but I have no idea who prescribed them to her and currently, they do not seem to be working. I do not want her to feel isolated from other people, but I admit that I find interacting with her hard due to the practical burden of her being relatively unresponsive and also because, if I'm honest (and I don't want this to be true, but it is), she scares me and the fact that she doesn't take care of her body as well as the mental toll these fake 'neighbours' are having on her make her a bit repulsive to me. I do not want her to suffer, I want to help, and I have no idea how. Me and my mother live in England, but we come over to Romania (where my grandma lives with my Dad) over whenever I have a school break. This means that I get little face-to-face interaction with her. What can I do for her?  


TL;DR: my granny has hallucinations that distress her terribly. How can I help?"

1481,"My wife has moments of rage with our young children (7 and 2). I love her, and overall, she's a great mother. Any thoughts on how to deal with this?","My wife of 10 years, who I love dearly and is generally great with our kids, has moments of uncontrollable rage with our children. Sometimes when they do something, cry/whine for too long or spill something, she just loses it and screams at them. She sometimes uses abusive language, ""You're a dumbass"", etc. The important part I think is it absolutely terrifies them.

She hasn't physically hit them when I'm around and I haven't heard anything from my children about that, but I'd be lying to say that I don't think it's a possibility. I doubt she would hurt them physically, but I was brought up (as was she) in a very nurturing environment. My parents probably yelled at me 5 times growing up and certainly never swore or lost their temper.

I've tried a lot of things...the first few times it happened, I waited and then discussed with her. As it's happened more, I've intervened in the moment, trying to get her to walk away and take some time to compose herself. Then, I've talked with her about her behavior and I believe she knows its wrong, but I think she just loses it. 

After each incident, I talk with my children and explain that their behavior that caused the outburst was incorrect, but that their mother's behavior was also incorrect. Also, that their mother is trying her best as I know they are. I make sure they know that we both love them very much.

I am worried though that this might be having an effect on my children. My wife was not like this before children, or at least I never saw any incidents in the 4 years we live together before we had children. Any thoughts on where to begin with this?"

1483,I’m willingly being Hospitalized tomorrow for Mental Health,"I’m 16F (I’m in Alabama in the US, and Bisexual in case that matters) and tomorrow my parents are taking me to the ER then a Hospital on the advice of my longtime Therapist and Psychiatrist. I’ve been diagnosed with OCD, ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. That being said I’m mainly going for severe anxiety and depression which has lead to Suicide attempts, self harm, extreme/intense random outbursts, and failure to function in society/school. The program is about two weeks and ironically at a University where I was looking to go to college (since I could get a full ride due to act score). This feels a bit like what I imagine jumping off a building into a bag of marshmallows feels like. 
I know I need to to go so that’s not what I’m worried about.

1485,I feel like I'm waiting for a sign,"I don't know if anyone can relate to this or understand what I mean but every day feels like a wait for someone to notice, for something to happen that triggers a positive change. But the thing is I don't know what I want people to see: that I want to die? That I'm unhappy, depressed, struggling? Because none of those are true, at least not to me. I don't know what I want people to see. I just seem to be waiting for an answer to float to me and declare everything alright already, and the most ironic part is that I know it doesn't work like that. I know change only comes from within myself and if I want to change my life for the better I have to speak up or make an effort to change, but why is it that I can't do it?

I just wanted to put some motivation out there for you all that you can get better and embrace your percieved weaknesses as a strength. I suffer from major depressive disorder, g.a.d., and social anxiety. These things have affected me so badly that there was a point in my life where I thought people were judging me for just the food I put in my basket at the grocery store. I couldnt go anywhere without severely changing the way I'd act just because I thought someone would judge me for just existing. I'd always have these competing dialogues in my head. One was the healthy dialogue that told me to put myself out there, which made me uncomfortable. The other told me to take it easy and indulge in junk food, play too many video games, and stay in my room. These dialogues always kept me at bay by the fight they always had between each other. It was easy to stay inside and indulge in skyrim and cod but I ultimately felt guilty/more depressed that I wasnt putting myself out there. This is a concept that I like to call thought combat. The idea that the angel and devil are constantly fighting in your head and making your life infinitely more confusing than it needs to be. Thought combat is now my brand and I use it to connect with more people like me. It's very small right now, but its helping me learn more about myself and how to deal with the way my head works. I hope that this can give you guys some motivation to start something like I did, because I feel awesome now that I'm building something i care about. (Apologies for how messy this is)"

I started my first session of therapy just this week and I’ve been training my brain that my fears aren’t routed to reality, but why do I resort to panic so easily when I could’ve done something else just as easily? Why am i in this constant state of battle with myself. It’s made my partner lose all trust in me, isolate myself from the world, and make myself a troubled person? No one suspects me as lost person at first glance. I wouldn’t suspect that as myself either!! Until I finally moved out on my own with my boyfriend."
1491,I don’t know what thoughts of mine to believe or how to live my life anymore - PLEASE HELP,"   A little background info: 19F, been living alone and self dependent for around 5 years now, so a lot of my “personal identity” has always been based around the fact that I am dependent, I go after the things I want, blah blah blah. I had a troubled childhood and for the past 5 years have been studying psychology/religion and working on unfolding my trauma and living a happier life. Fast forward, I had two acid trips within the last 6 months which broke this reality, and every other reality I had been unknowingly holding onto. Now, I am left with nothing but my thoughts, which are constantly contradicting themselves, constantly clashing, constantly fucking buzzing, because they are the only connection to my sanity that I have left. I do not know who I am, who I was, what I want, this questions all seem so fucking ridiculous right now. Thus, I observe my thoughts, because they are out of my control and so must be coming from some place true inside of myself. 
   Here is where the issue comes in, I am now stuck. My thoughts are never stable, constantly jumping between pessimism and optimism, both of which bring out a different attitude and outlook on life. In times, I find myself not being able to get myself to go to work 3 days out of the week, some days not even able to brush my teeth. And then one night at 4AM after letting my thoughts run wild I’ll have “an awakening” (and I call it that because it literally feels like I awake from my haze of depression” ) and my great mood suddenly kicks in, and I decide I’m going to quit weed, going to start saving, I basically get this newfound motivation to start living my life fully. Some days this sticks, and I stay on this positivity stream for weeks, some days the next day I am back to square 1. I really believe that work is bullshit, and that I want to isolate myself from society and go be a monk, but then I have times where I believe that I should buy in to the work,spend,die mentality cause that’s just life. Neither of those thoughts make me “happy” because I am still HERE regardless. 
   I think I am driving myself crazy. I can longer differentiate whether this is normal behavior or not because it’s all I have, if that makes sense. I cannot recall how I used to mentally function before the acid. I cannot recall even how my 1,2,3 brain process was. However at the same time I also believe that what I am doing is not healthy, I am living inside my head and based on my research and my personal experiences with my brother who went crazy after several acid trips, I know this is not the way to go. I am worried I am getting more out of touch with the real world, which is making it harder for me to go to work, communicate, socialize, and thus bringing me deeper into my depression. I am scared I am going to hit a point of no return, either by messing up my life or messing up my brain. 
   I am starting to doubt I am bipolar (it runs in the family) but at the same time I do not want to self diagnose, or unknowingly use that as the “answer” to my problem just so I can categorize it away. I am always a strong believer that your life is what you make it, and you are in complete control of your thoughts, so for me to accept the reality that I am bipolar, and I do not have complete control over my thoughts (they are the only thing I’m holding on to right now) is a lot for me to process, therefore I am really trying to avoid going to the doctor and getting assessed. 
   All I need to know is that I am not going crazy. That somebody out there has been here. That somebody out there can tell me what to do, regardless how ridiculous that sounds, because I really don’t know myself enough anymore to make a decision and stick with it. Thoughts?"

Yesterday during work, I confided in a friend about how I was feeling and stated I was having suicide thoughts. We ended up calling my GP who told me to go straight to the Crisis Team at my local hospital. I got my mum to pick me up and we went. It wasn't the best experience ever and caused a lot more stress than it should have. 

Today, I've been to see my doctor to get more antidepressants. No support was given, so mum being mum really wasn't happy. However, I'm feeling a million times better today. Yesterday I was thinking how I was going to do it. Today I'm not happy, but I'm not sad. I suppose I'm a bit numb.

Anyway, I've been working in this role for 6 months now and never told my boss initially because I thought it may influence the recruitment process. However, I'm booked in to see a psychiatrist soon (finally!) And I cant take time off without good reason or proof which brings me to telling him.

I am a timid and quiet guy. Not the brightest nor the dumbest. This started becoming a problem when I joined work and my colleagues started making fun of me, because I did not have a girl friend and that I am still a virgin whose is nearing his thirties. I live with my parents and I'm really awkward socially. This made the situation worse. Now I quit the company, after which lost my mom, got into debt and now have a freelance job that barely pays but since I've put in the work I don't want to quit without seeing some return. The problem with this loneliness is it's bringing out all the rage that I have kept inside from all these years of teasing and abuse. I now work alone at home and I've observed that sometimes I talk to myself. This happens when the memories of my past experiences come up and I pace my room creating those situations with my ex colleagues. Only now I'm fighting them by re-enacting the scene except I'm only punching air. This occasionally comes up when I'm walking in the street. Maybe people see it on my face or maybe I'm mumbling something. I don't know. I also get irritated when someone takes my stuff purposefully and I dread meeting anyone whom I think will make me anxious. My circle of friends is less and the fact that I'm not earning much also prohibits me from joining groups where I might have to spend money.

Please help me. I don't know how to deal with this."
1496,I honestly think I should drop out,So I've been thinking I should drop out of school and I just can't do it anymore this school is fucking stupid and im going to drop out. I've been bullied and I don't understand algebra 1 and im crying the whole class thinks I'm stupid so I'm done I quit.
1497,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I always feel worthless, I deserve . I’m ugly,short,fat retarded and it only gets worse with me. Every time I look at someone I always think in my mind “why couldn’t I have been them?,why was I cursed to be this human trash?, why me?” Everyone else is so much better than me. Sometimes I think I should just kill myself and make space for someone better, someone more deserving and they make the world a better place, but I never had the guts to do so , so I slowly poison my body with horrible junk food and play video games 24/7 until I am put out if my misery. I can’t make friends and I can’t even talk to people because of bad social anxiety and everyone sees me as this creepy repulsive monster and so do I. I sometimes harm myself by banging my head on a door because I shouldn’t be alive and deserve to be punished for 
It. No one wants to be my friend and no one should be. It’s been like this for the past year and gradually getting worse. I just want someone to end me.

I spent days forcing myself to make this post because I deserve to live like this and that nobody would care but I know I need help."
1498,I’m sick of feeling worthless,"I just want to believe I can be a worthwhile person. Time after time, I try to see something good in myself, but it always makes me feel worse. I just want to know if I’m truly worth all of my distress or if I should just cut my losses. Now, I have no plans to end my own life, I just wish I could live life where that thought wouldn’t actively come to mind. I just want to be worth something."
1499,My mom is mentally ill and refuses treatment,"As stated in the title, my mom is mentally ill, and refuses to seek treatment. 

Ever since the beginning of her mental breakdown, I've been rethinking about my past, and realized that this issue has been undiagnosed, untreated, and unacknowledged for the majority of my (and her) life. It started when we first moved to Oregon in 2000- she began complaining that the neighbors were being too noisy. We even moved apartments in the complex to get away from 'crazy neighbors'- neighbors I neither heard nor came into contact with. And since then, she has always had a problem with her neighbors as long as she's living in an apartment. 

She moved out of apartment living for several years and the moment she came back into it, she began having trouble with her neighbors again. She claimed that her neighbors were now recording her while she slept at night and playing audio of it whenever she was trying to sleep. She was so worked up over this that I eventually got a handful of my friends together and came over to the apartment unannounced to 'put the fear of god' into her neighbors in an attempt to get them to stop. Only when we showed up at my mom's apartment, she vehemently refused to let me take action, and wouldn't give us the apartment number. Needless to say- this is when my suspicions started.

She moved in with her friend and all was quiet for a year before 2018- when hell started. She lost her job of 22 years (layoffs- unrelated to mental health) and it wasn't long after that she started having problems with her neighbors AGAIN. Her neighbors were recording her AGAIN. And when I brought this up; she denied that she ever had this happen in the past to begin with- knowing damn well that my friends and I  showed up on her doorstep looking to beat someone's ass because of it. It wasn't long after that she began her slow descent into madness.

I begged for her to seek help- she wouldn't. There ""was nothing wrong with her"" its ""just the crazy neighbors harassing me"" or her favorite excuse ""you don't know what's going on"" or ""there's something going on that you just won't understand"". Her behavior had become so erratic that I took matters into my own hands and had her committed. Needless to say- it didn't help and only caused more problems going forward as she immediately stopped taking her medication after her release- there's nothing wrong with her, ya know. Not even a day after her release and she was making claims that she was in witness protection and that she couldn't leave the house under threat of imprisonment. It got so bad that I had to almost physically drag her out of the house just for her to get groceries. 

A year of conspiracy and 'you don't know whats going on's' later and I move in to another apartment with her to monitor her, take care of her, and help her pay off her medical bills ($1,500 a day for a stay in a mental health facility- yeah, our system isn't broken at all) and we weren't in the apartment for 24 hours before there was problems. The first week the neighbors were at it again. ""They"" and ""them"" installed speakers in the apartment to play noise to harass her and the switching and replacing of items nonsense began along with lasers being shot into her eyes. And a month in she was sent home from her job, at Goodwill, on account of her being mentally unfit for duty (I got a call from her boss and company lawyer asking me if she was taking medication). She would eventually lose this job and claim that she quit- which was a blatant lie.

The past 8 months have been hell. She's a nightmare and a complete nuisance. Anything and everything is on the table when it comes to my mom's delusions and they're all completely arbitrary. She thinks that people are stealing and replacing food, furniture, clothes, jewelry, antiques, her betta fish, etc. She's become an expert in every field- able to find (or create) details in objects to confirm her delusions (she destroyed her mom's antique ring that she's been wearing for years because she closed her hand in a door and bent it slightly- so she became an expert jeweler/metallurgist, claiming that the properties in the metal were stronger in her mom's ring- this was a replacement, etc). The worst part is her anger and outbursts. 

She screams at people who aren't there (shut up, go away, leave me alone, get out, etc) and stomps on the floor or throws stuff at the walls in retaliation of things being said and done 'by the neighbors'. As a result the police have been called a handful of times and a had a litany of noise complaints filed against us- so much so that the rental office has decided to evict us. The kicker? All of this is done when I'm not home. All of this has happened while I'm either at work or out trying to live my life away from this toxic cesspool of insanity. And- all the noise complaints- I didn't see one posted on the door because my mom hid them from me. I didn't know about the piling up complaints until we were one warning away from being served an eviction- Which still angers me greatly. 

My mom's newest delusion is that she doesn't have to leave. That the rental office is in league with ""them"" and ""they"" the great arbitrators of ""you don't know what's going on"" in a conspiracy against her. We were served our notice on the 4th of Feb and not a single thing has been packed or put into storage on her end. The worst part? I can't help her. I've tried EVERYTHING in my power over the past TWO YEARS to get help and nothing has worked. The state doesn't give a fuck, the county doesn't give a fuck, our family wont lift a finger to help, and the entire system couldn't care less about a former veteran struggling with mental health issues.

Its been tearing me to pieces...

But, if I'm being honest, my patience is all but spent. I've been torn down, lied to, deceived, and blamed for and by my mom for her issues. ""none of this would have happened if you didn't put me in that place"" is her favorite line. And to be honest- I've had enough of being in her corner and getting punched around because of it. All I've read over the past month is to take care of myself and to think about me before her in this situation- two years ago I couldn't see that as a possibility. Today- that idea has changed. The stress and anxiety of this situation has been so great that my own mental and physical health has begun to decline. Stomach issues, sleep issues, eating issues, and alcohol abuse had become apart of my life as I desperately try to find some form of release; some kind of something to make me feel good. And I cannot live that life any more- its time to take my life back.

I feel like a complete failure on all fronts. I feel like had I known about her conditions earlier in her life, when her parents were still alive and our family closer, I may have been able to get through to her. Unfortunately- 20 plus years of lying to yourself and others about your conditions is a lot of time to get accustomed to your own bullshit- and there's nothing I can do to fix that. The only option I have left is to leave her to fall on her face and hope that she learns her lesson. By not leaving this apartment, she will be escorted out and off property by police, the locks will be changed, and all of her belongings will be thrown away. All because she wouldn't stop being an asshole to the people around her, not taking responsibility for her illness, and not seeking treatment. And there's two parts of me in conflict over this situation- the part that empathizes and doesn't want to see my mom homeless and screaming in the streets, and the other part of me that wants it to happen so that she may finally see the error of her ways.

Only thing is... I don't see my mom ever changing. And I feel like this war has just begun."
1500,I am worried to visit a psychiatrist coz that i am not actually mentally ill,"I [M]  have a typical sad story, straight B (mainly because i never cared about grades) student in highschool, that year i had broke up with my LDR GF because she swore not to unfriend my bff and they were both stubborn and getting closer to each other, and i was insecure because my at the time bff was also my ex Bully, and it put me into a self imposed isolation in highschool, right before my Bac exams to enroll into uni my parents had a huge fight, my mom was beat senseless one morning when i woke up, her whole body was bruises and blood, and i did nothing and instead of hurting my father, i just escaped with my mom i took refugee with one of the neighbors next door, and i felt hugely emasculated and powerless, a few days going from relatives house to house till my parents made up (my mother was forced to otherwise they threatened anybody who sheltered her), i come home and study for a few days and get one of the highest grades in the country top 3%, in the summer break before enrollment i was disinterested in everything including friends considering i had no pocket money, then uni enrollment results came back and i got into engineering, i had no interest whatsoever, but i just went on with it, nothing changed and i did nothing that summer, stayed home all day all night watching animes and movies and socializing on social media, one year down the line finished the first year easy peasy but along the way on my second year i lost two of my bffs once again as i had crush on one of them and they were once again getting closer to each other, i firstly told myself that it didn't matter, and i wouldn't let my past experience repeat, but it did happen once again, and i just ghosted both of them, and went into a hysteric depression where all my thought was always on them for like a year or two down the line, and i failed that year at uni, but i had lost all interest in exams and didn't even attend my final exams as i hadn't studied priorly on daily basis coz i deluded myself with tons of passive watching and online gaming to avoid the thoughts, hence i didn't attend the exams and just redid the year, yet again to escaping All the exams once again on the second try, but i passed the year miraculously without studying for any exam just recalling what i heard in the lectures and passed the year, i also had found another modest beautiful LDR GF but this relationship was healthy despite everything, and it went on for a two or three years, on my third year i still didn't attend any exam or prepare for any class, and just passively went on the days, at that point i was left with no friends mind you i had lost two bffs actually 3 and i had no faith in anybody, i obviously failed the third grade once again and i am on my second attempt on the third grade right now, i still don't attend any exam or do any homework, i have gained a couple of good friends in the last two years, and i did break up with my latest LDR GF because it was unfair for her to date a maniac like me who had no obvious Crystal future, and i would totally be happy for her happiness, mind you she's succeeding in life, and i am happy for her once again, our breakup was the healthiest, like we so chill, so back to me i am still living at home, with no money of my own (just a bit from odd jobs) and have developed a healthy routine with exercising at home, i did try gym but it's not my cup of tea, i am physically healthy, and not totally isolated in uni as many people approach me (altho i am left out of outgoings) and i have got no talents, no Hobbies aside from workout, and a failure at uni, and i rarely ever go out, holiday season? Once per ten days, yeah i rarely ever see the sun, weekends? Maybe to buy something, but i only go out in the evening, and I spent today only messaged my ex and this other girl that seems to have a crush on me, talked to my siblings and my mom, and binge watched a TV series.         
So am i depressed? Or is it just an unhealthy lifestyle? Could a Psychiatrist help me? And if so how?"
1501,I'm scared of everything I can.,"I apologize for the errors, I use Google translator.  To begin with, I'm too scared.  It is scared in everything, in studies, in relations with family and friends, in their interests and hobbies, and also very scared of the future.  And even though I’m afraid of all this, even if I want to direct everything in the right direction, while I treat everyone with indifference and at the same time I don’t understand why.  I’m unlikely to pass the math exam and stay in the second year, I understand that everything depends on me, but I can’t.  Every time I start to take everything into my hands, I am attacked by sadness and complete indifference to everything, in the end I give up all this without starting.  My relations with classmates are not terrible only at first glance, I just can’t tolerate these people, except for a few good people in my opinion and one girl (with whom, by the way, I communicate very well and I want to tell her about my more and more growing sympathy  , but I'm afraid that she will not like it very much and I will lose contact with her).  My relationship with my parents is nothing, we communicate very little, I’m afraid to tell them what worries me because I’m afraid to be misunderstood, I’m afraid that they will consider me weak, I’m afraid that I won’t become anyone and break their heart.  I’m practically not interested in anything.  I do not read, do not do painting, I do not do any self-development at all, although I would like to.  The only thing that interests me in this regard is music.  I like to do it, but you won’t go far on this.  But the worst and most frightening thing is the future, seriously.  I don’t know what I will do, where will I go to study after school?  Will I go to work?  Will I tell her what I want?  Will I be able to ennoble my parents for everything they have done for me?  Tomorrow literally scares me.  I am more and more immersed in myself.  I just wanted to share my thoughts with someone, I'm tired of the fact that all the time I can not talk to relatives or friends, so let the one who sees this be you.  Perhaps this text will seem to you incoherent typing, but I can not do anything at the moment, except to state the tones of sick letters."

1505,My therapist kind of ghosted me...,"Sorry guys, it's a little long. I'll put a tldr at the bottom.

Hey guys, I need some advice on whether or not to go back to my therapist. A month ago I was at my new student conference for transferring to a bigger university. While checking in, I got a text that my father had lost his job. Great news to receive. Immediately I considered withdrawing and taking a semester off. Got further into the conference, realized my major was not at all what I wanted. It's essentially just supply chain management and technical sales. I'm no salesperson and I have zero interest in SCM. I started to freak out and tried to call the admissions office to ask if I could defer my admission and allow myself time to think but they told me no. I called my therapists office to ask if I could talk to him over the phone since I was in the middle of a crisis and told them it was urgent. He didn't call back. Called again the next day and left another message for him. Still no call back. I haven't heard from him since. I ended up withdrawing from the school since I had no interest in my major and I would be wasting time and money. Now since my dad lost his job we have to sell our house and move, which is also stressful. Not to mention my mother has been cheating on my dad for two years and I only discovered recently. Now I have to apply to colleges if I want to go back to school in the fall, but I have NO CLUE where to go or what to study. I've wanted to speak to someone about my issues since early January but now I'm not sure if I should go back to him. He never called to check on me, and I feel like he isn't taking me seriously anymore. Unfortunately, I no longer have health insurance to pay for appointments and he runs me $86 for an hour usually (crazy). I don't want to have to spend several sessions reacquainting myself with a new therapist. Should I go back and see him? Or should I find someone else? He's always been sort of meh, but my last therapist outed my moms affair and got CPS called on me, so he's certainly better, despite being a recovering drug addict. What do you guys think?

TLDR: left 2 urgent messages for my therapist when making a big stressful life decision, never got a response. Do I go back and assume it was accidental? Or do I find a new therapist and spend several sessions gaining trust back?"
1506,Speaking,Ive always had a problem speaking. I’ve always talked and communicated minimal. I always stutter and mix words cause I think way way too fast. Why can I never control it or what can I do to help it? Never really tried too fix it because I got along with this just fine.
1507,Has your mental illness done anything GOOD for you?,"So, I suffer from two different mental illnesses, they both negatively affect my life to a massive degree.  However, I’d be lying if I said that no good came from it, they taught me that looking after yourself is a big step in improving your situation.

I used to just sit and let them take over my life, abusing different drugs to fill the void. Once I started making small little changes, I noticed I could manage easier. 

Things are still very hard, and I do rely on medication. But sometimes I find myself letting out a real laugh and a big smile. 

Rare moments like that is what encourages me to make put in more effort."
1508,Can you date an ocd person and be happy in relationship? Control and manipulation,"I don’t know what to do.. my boyfriend of long term had an ocd crisis over one year ago and it was the moment when everything went down with our relationships( now he takes the medicine). I love him so much but I never sufferEd so much all because of his obsessions and thought related only to me. I don’t know whether I can take it now. We are on the long distance relationships right now. He says I don’t apprecite him (crazy idea he got) and always thinks some dark stuff about me although I was supporting him And loved every second. Now it’s the peak point for me, everything I say if it’s not what he imagines in his head is like an extreme fight and him saying «I ruined everything  and why I couldn’t say Smth in some particular way“ basically Controlling every my word and manipulating my actions. I really don’t know what to do, he changes his mood from super happy to being very accusative and blaming me for everything in the world .

has anyone of you had problems dating someone with severe OCD ? Are there any chances To be happy with him one day? what should be prepared for dating An ocd person?"

And all of a sudden, within less than a minute that happy feeling just disappeared and was replaced with a massive sadness that I feel is going to explode.

I was having a good time and now all of a sudden I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown and I want to SH again. What happened? 

My heart’s beating is taking my breath away and I feel empty. My body feels empty, but my soul is so unbelievably sad that I want to take it out on my body. All evening I’ve been acting like I’m okay when I’m devastated for no reason. 

Is this normal? This feeling is really hurting and I don’t know what to do"
1513,Unreasonable for dad to kick me (23) out for not passing a drug test?,"I’ll start off by saying I am 23 and I live with my dad. I was committed to a mental hospital 2 months ago for trying to commit suicide and have no money saved up as of right now. I started working again a few weeks ago and have been going every time. 

I have one friend. That friend I usually smoke weed with at his house. After I’m done hanging out with him, I stay in my car and sleep/kill time so when I drive home I’m not stoned. I do not drive impaired. 

I smoke generally once or twice a week with said friend, and I use it as a medicine since I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I take lexapro and latuda for those things in addition. I do not have my medical card, but plan to obtain it as soon as possible. 

My dad got wind that I was smoking at my friends house and is old school about weed. He said he will drug test me in two weeks and if I’m dirty (obviously will be, 2 weeks is not enough time, but he’s oblivious) then he will kick me out of the house. I don’t smoke at his house, I don’t come home stoned ever, and I go to work. I mind my own business and get my stuff done. I understand it’s his house with his rules, but I can’t understand why he would kick me out leaving me nowhere to live if I fail a drug test. My smoking does nothing to interfere with his life or my own in any negative way. I’ve tried explaining this to him, as well as the reasons why I smoke. 

I just feel like I can get a grip of reality even smoking once a week because it helps me chill out and allows me to think about my life without going berserk. My therapist also said that she believes weed is okay even with the meds I’m on and smoking occasionally can be beneficial to my mental health. I’ve tried explaining all of this to my dad, but he just won’t listen. 

Is he being unreasonable by doing this? I get it’s his house, but I literally have no where else to go and no money saved."
1514,I think I have a problem with food.,"I don't want to self-diagnose but I think I definetly have a problem. I used to take olanzapine so I ballooned to 20 stone. now I've lost at least nearly 4 stone again. I don't choose to starve myself or anything but I eat very little a day now. Right now I live in residential care so I have my main dinner made for me, which I still haven't eaten a whole one of yet. Some days that'll be all I eat, unless I go to the shop and get some chocolate. I probably eat around 1000 calpries a day, though some days I have known that I haven't eaten at all for a day or two. I'm starting to feel sick often because of it and often I'm too weak to actually make something for myself. I don't keep any food at home. But I guess nobody suspects there is a problem cos I'm still actually overweight"

this probably overlaps with my OCD, but I recently been obsessing about my body image and scrutinizing everything that I eat.

1519,"Met a person online, looks like he's suicidal. I need some help.","Sorry to throw it here like this, but I need some word of advice.

Me and my friend are running a clan, we play games together and we invite people who seem fun. We invited one that seemed a bit odd. On voicechat he could be quite annoying because he was humming to him self or playing some music really loudly.

Later we discovered that he might not be doing good in life, If it was lack of friends or something else, I don't correctly remmeber. So we decided to keep him in the clan, in hopes that he could make friends and just enjoy the time with us.

But today it got really bad, he was muted a couple of times and team-killed in the game because he was playing music/sounds really loudly. (and that blame falls on me)

After a while he sent couple of mesagges into the team chat saying: ''Maybe I should leave this clan'', ''you guys don't seem to like me here anyway, it's the same in school AND at home.''

After that my friend got him into a private chat and went to play a different game. I messaged my friend how is it going. (he was still talking to him) Well, let me just say I wasn't prepared for this...

He admited to being suicidal, he was saying he wants to kill him self, he sent pictures of knots and some videos, all this came from a ''suicide folder''. My friend believes they are not his but still really worrying. My friend also believs he may have done some self harm.

My friend is still curenntly talking to him, he is not sending any pictures but he is still sad and was sobbing a while ago.

He is around 15 years old and I believe he comes from Sweden. So if you have any advice how we could help him, please do send me some."
1520,Looking for suggestions for a good psychologist and/or clinic for a thorough psychological assessment in Ontario (Canada),"Hi everyone,

As the title says, I am looking for recommendations on a good psychologist/clinic to get an assessment of myself performed. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression in the past but I haven't responded well to treatment for those conditions over the past couple of years. I brought up some concerns with my therapist and she thought it would be a good idea to get professionally assessed for a couple of different conditions including bipolar, autism, and possibly a learning disability. 

I am willing to go anywhere around the Toronto, London, or Windsor areas to see a provider.  I'd preferably like to see a provider who has experience with diagnosing adults on the Autism Spectrum (I am 21) because of the special diagnostic skills required to assess adults on the spectrum. Also, I plan on paying privately.

Sorry for taking so long and thank you for reading if you made it this far! I greatly appreciate your suggestions!!"
