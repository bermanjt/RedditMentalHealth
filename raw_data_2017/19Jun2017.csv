1,"Hi. I'm fairly certain my SO is a compulsive liar. He says things I know are not true from what he did that day to conversations he had with people. He lies about things that don't really even matter on a daily basis and they seems like a form of making himself feel better about his life. An example is he recently joined a hockey team but couldn't play last week. He told me how they had messaged him in the group chat how much they needed him and what an asset he is to the team. I read the messages and no one said anything like that. He will comment on social media on the things he did that day when in reality all we did was sit around the house. The majority of things he lies about are harmless but sometimes there are serious things too. I used to call him out on things right away but he would get angry and I realized that is not the best way to go about it. I realize this is his way of coping, maybe it's low self esteem but I really want to discourage this behavior. Has anyone dealt with this before? How can I subtly deter this behavior? I thought maybe when he tells one of his lies to simply ignore it or downplay it so he doesn't feel it's ""working"". I love him no matter what but it's getting to the point other people have started to pick up on what he is doing and I don't want him to lose people over it. I want to be as supportive as possible without enabling this behavior. Advice?",19Jun2017,2

3,"Hello. 
I was recently diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety due to a breakdown by my school doctor. However, I am still having trouble relating or feeling like I have depression or anxiety. 

After my diagnosis, I felt better and I even went home. My situation was fixed and life was getting better. After coming home (which felt like a unproductive vacation (I did not like that much)), I've been working constantly and been cancelling plans with all my friends. I feel good because I'm being productive. I'm working PT, I'm also going to my internship while still finding time relaxing. This is good for me.

But there are times where I feel lonely but I don't want to see anyone. I want to cry but I don't know why. I don't think this is depression but I really don't feel sad. I just don't feel anything, I feel empty. I've felt like this in high school but I never thought of this much. I don't want to see anyone and I always take days to reply to my messages. What is this feeling? I'm not sad nor unhappy. I'm confused. 

Tldr; what is feelings? I don't know. I'm from Canada. 

Edit: My ex-best friend has depression. I know everyone is different and there are many types of depression but I feel like her's is real and mine isn't. I feel like I'm just going through a phase but this phase keeps on creeping back again and again. ",19Jun2017,2
4,"Hi,
I have been at university for a year now and I've been lonely in my university accommodation since day 1. I am not friends with my flatmates. I hate them as a result of not speaking to them about matters that would normally be easily resolved if I had a regular amount of communication. I spend as much time as possible at my uni radio station because as soon as I come home I have no one to talk to. This has had a terrible effect on my social life.  


I collect Funko Pop Vinyl figures because they give me a reason to be excited to come home. However, I have spent Â£400+ on these figures and on a student budget, this isn't ideal. Is it healthy/normal to do what I am doing? If not, what are ways around it?",19Jun2017,1

I know I need professional help to get a proper diagnosis for this but I thought I would ask. 

I'm wondering if this is a mental condition. I'm not sure how to explain it, but I have this fossil that has a crack in it, and if I pull it apart ever so slightly it gets bigger, and I'm tempted to keep going and going until it fully breaks, but I don't actually want to. Another example is there is a cracked pane of glass at work, which if you push on it slightly it moves, and I have an urge to keep pushing and pushing even though I definitely should not. And another example is I like to push my bottom teeth against my top teeth to the point where I'm scared I'll break my tooth. Any information if appreciated. ",19Jun2017,3
6,"basically my mum ruined my dads life, he ended up going skitz in and out of mental health wards in hospital. she blamed me for her second failed marriage and still treats me in this way that i cant really explain but i want to cut her ear to ear and watch her bleed, i picture her doing the little act she does and then i picture me actually killing her and it gives me a surge in my body and i feel alive for like 2 seconds.. really need some advice here, when i bring my mental health up to her she says it will pass, but i know for a fact she doesn't want me going to the doc because she is a nurse ( i went on a drug binge around 15/16 and ended up in hospital ) and she wouldnt even pick me up when my heart was beating out of my chest and i was hearing stuff that wasnt there. i hate her so much i feel like spitting in her face and punching her i do not treat her with any respect what so ever any more since a young age, she just doesn't want to deal with having children, im 20 now but i feel sorry for my little brother she just let him go where he wanted, luckily enough my dad stays with his mum and dad so my lil bro stays there.

I keep playing mind games with myself to keep myself distracted. Even so, words from the fight keep coming back to me. I haven't eaten and I'm really hungry but I've managed to quash my brain''s attempts to go back for the most part and I really don't want to lose that progress

On top of memories from the fight I keep seeing memories of my dad's blowups and how terrifying they all were. I'm not scared of those anymore, I've been seeing those for 10 years and most of them have lost their sting. Regardless, I'm not really prepared to take them right now when I'm trying so desperately to check out of my own head.

18,"It may be because I was probably brought up that way. In my family, we don't believe in overtly showing our affection to each other, except may be my mom who would try to show it once in a long while. My dad is a veteran, and growing up, we never had a very casual interaction. I can't remember the last time I ever hugged anyone in my family. However, we are a close and secure family and we know that we care deeply for each other. With my brother, sometimes I don't even have to say it for him to know exactly what I mean. My mom can sense if something is wrong with me, sitting thousands of miles away from me.

However, this doesn't fare out very well in the outside world. People expect you to show your love. And it is extremely difficult for me to do it. It feels so inherently fake when I see couples doing PDA. I have a broken relationship, and I attribute a part of the blame to my inability to show my love. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not a heartless moron, in fact I am very sensitive. But this inability to express my love to others has started bothering me. What can I do in this regard?",20Jun2017,1

21,"I always have trouble organizing my thoughts, even when I'm typing and I have the possibility to make drafts and what not, so I will try my best to say what's on my mind lately without stepping outside of my thought process. English is not my first language and even though I studied it for most of my teenage years, it has become rusty because of my anxiety/depression issues, so excuse me if something's not clear or if something seems too redundant/repetitive. More on that later.

I'll start by shortly describing myself and just give important details for this post. I'm currently 27, 28 in november. I'm from Mexico and I loved music in general, discovering new bands, playing guitar with my friends and I have a bachelor's degree that I hate and was a mistake (on finance and accountancy). My family is a ""normal"", functional family by the country's standards, and I consider myself lucky to have them by my side. We had financial problems for some time in the past but it's all over and now we are ok, upper-mid class I think. I was diagnosed with a bunch of psychiatric problems after a very bad cannabis trip (I had been smoking for years but that night I had several panic attacks and everything went downhill since that night) at 22. One or two weeks after that night, my girlfriend took me to the doctor because I started experiencing severe depersonalization/derealization and crazy moodswings at random moments for 2 weeks. I still remember myself crying while laughing out loud and trying to explain her what I was feeling at that moment. I'll never forget the look on her face (she was so scared/sad). I hid every evidence from my close family because I thought this was only a result from marijuana use, and my family is VERY close minded, so I avoided direct contact for a while, staying in my room whenever possible and talking little about my day during dinner or on Sunday family reunions. After I learned from my doctor that the cannabis just triggered something inside my head and it was just a catalyst, I opened more about my current condition and started taking several pills soon afterwards. 

The whole experience was a living hell. I remember not wanting to wake up in the morning because another day full of depersonalization, anxiety and negative thoughts was awaiting me, but to my luck, after three or four weeks of benzodiazepine treatment, it all started to go away. I traveled to Europe for vacations and it just seemed to fit right in the moment. I forgot about my problems and I was very happy at the time, even though some days I had slight anxious episodes, but just normal ones like the ones I've had since I was a toddler.

Fast forward to this day- I'm an adult who doesn't know what to do with his own life. I don't do any of the things I used to enjoy before. My girlfriend is still with me, though. Some years ago I went back to the shrink and started taking pills again because of crippling depression and got diagnosed with pure O, GAD and chronic depression. I didn't want to wake up, I couldn't take a shower and even the most simple tasks seem daunting. I stopped practicing guitar because my self-esteem started plummeting suddenly. To this day I think I have no talent in anything. Music just sounds like noise for me, my circle of friends has shrunk to 2 or 3 people and I have almost lost all of my social skills. Having a one on one conversation with an unknown person seems impossible- I just think my life is boring and I have NOTHING to share with others. Photography was my hobby and I used Instagram to upload small shots I took, but it's been long since I logged into my account. I don't go out and party anymore because I hate having contact with crowds, I've missed concerts from my favorite bands because of that. I don't have a job because I hate the career I chose. I still live with my parents. These things didn't happen all of a sudden. It has been a slow process that's killing my former self and I've tried EVERYTHING to stop it, but I can't. Suicidal thoughts have become more recurrent, but I think I would never do it because I'm a coward and I still care for those few who love me. Even watching movies seem like a chore to me. I've been binge-watching anime for some time now and that's the only thing that keeps me away from bad thoughts and the only thing that gets me away from the reality I hate. Videogames don't do it anymore for me even though I played for 23+ years of my life.

I've been through it all- doctors, pills (I have tried many of them and I could list them but it's long; Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, Prozac, Brintellix, Effexor, Rivotril, Lexapro, Celexa, Luvox, Zoloft, Paxil, Remeron, Zyprexa, Symbyax, Xanax) alternative treatments, tons of psychologist (I think I've been to 13 or 14, at least), meditation, diet change, exercise (this one has been the hardest to pull off), the list goes on.

I'm desesperately running out of ideas and every night I can't sleep thinking that I will end up being a hobo on the streets after my parents die or after they realize I'm just a parasite in their lives. They are kind of old, 67 and 68 respectively. Last year my mother underwent emergency surgery due to a fatal condition known as Toxic Megacolon and was left with an Ileostomy and a diet to survive. My father has prostate cancer, liver diseases, diabetes and what not.

My brother is married and has his own family, but my sister keeps close contact with me, trying to keep everything from getting worse. I don't really get along with any of them (including my parents) because my ideas stem far from theirs. They are all religious and old-school.My brother is 41 and my sister is 40.

So, right now, my days just consist of waking up very late, usually 2 pm or 3 pm, helping my mom with some chores or cooking her food, eating, browsing the internet in my cellphone until my girlfriend leaves work, visit her for a while and have dinner together, get back to my house, feed my pets and browse the internet again until 6 or 7 am, watching anime or posting random stuff in forums.

I've tried working with my brother for my father's small business, but it's not for me, and to be honest, I have no damn idea what I'm doing everytime I'm asked to do something. As time passes, I'm starting to feel more and more pressure because everytime I check Facebook, I see my peers getting married, having kids, traveling around the world and just living a happy, normal life. I can't believe it has all come to this. When I was a kid I thought I was going to be a successful doctor or a scientist, living somewhere else where interesting things happen or where the weather is nice, New York, the Netherlands, London or whatever, and look at me now. I couldn't even make it in the music business because I stopped caring about it. I stopped caring about everything. Every day I hate myself more than the last one, and even the smallest activity seems like a very hard thing to do, I swear. I could just stay in bed all day, browsing the web, without eating or without doing nothing.

I tried to get myself into psychology and philosophy too, to help me get my thoughts straight. But it ended up being worse because now I see no point in existing or doing anything, yet I feel dread and paralyzed every second because I just want to be as happy as I was as a kid or as a teenager. I just wish I could travel back in time and fix my life, but I know I'm doomed, and seeking help from people over the internet that can share similar stories or feel empathy for me, because no one around me understands what's going on inside my head, I swear. Back in my college days I used to feel way different. I used to feel intelligent, I think I was above the average, but now I just feel as stupid as a garbage can.

Sorry for the long rant, I feel like I didn't even touch important points regarding my psychological being, but I'm tired and suddenly burned out. 

I hope some of you that have been through similar situations eventually found your way out of it. It's horrible.

22,"It's as the title says, I've been struggling off and on with eating and after doctor visits, a blood test, and nurse hotline consulting they've concluded it's mental and not physical. I've been under stress lately with work and social situations and I think it's the source. I have the feeling of hunger, but anything I try to eat I become nauseous, my throat feels like it's closing, and I can't swallow. It's like force feeding yourself a food you detest or when you're so full you feel like you're going to pop. I feel nauseous most of the time quite honestly and the only thing I can consume right now that isn't straight water is chicken broth. I've tried reading up on self help to reduce and manage stress, but articles I've read generally don't apply. It's not that I can't manage the work load and social situations, but I'm instead overwhelmed and can't back out of them. Meditation and venting don't do anything for me, nor does relaxing in a bath. I can't stop thinking about the problems so the only time I get a break is sleeping, but even that's difficult. Can anyone offer advice or give recommendations on managing stress?

But the older I get it seems like it's becoming increasingly difficult to even think . In the past couple of years it has become way worse than before . Even stringing together a coherent sentence is sometimes a challenge and I'll find myself often using words and saying things that probably makes no sense to anyone but me because I can't think of the correct words to use. Anytime i have to actually think about something , like anything from someone asking me a question to problem solving , It's like there is a tornado filled with garbage thoughts spinning in my brain but somewhere deep in the tornado is the thought that I need to be focusing on and if I'm lucky it might pass by me just long enough to attempt to come up with some response or solution to what's going on around me . And that ""tornado"" is always there , no matter what I'm doing i just have a constant stream of random pointless thoughts going through my mind . My social skills has almost completely dissappeared , I hardly know how to function around a group of people anymore and find myself feeling awkward and out of place . It's extremely hard for me to carry a conversation now and if I do it usually seems very generic and scripted. It's almost physically hurts to read and processes information.  If I read anything I usually can't remember what I just read and have a hard time understanding it if I do . Its becoming very hard to take in almost any kind of knowledge.  I know this is now me and I feel trapped in my own mind that seems to be growing more dull every moment . Its hurting my marriage , my job  and is holding me back as a parent.

34,"I've struggled with mental illness (depression, anxiety, OCD) since high school, and was relatively successful throughout college.

I started treatment for these illnesses just last year, but was recently diagnosed with presumptive narcolepsy. I have a sleep test scheduled in a few weeks to confirm the diagnosis, but I've had to drop my medication (Zoloft) as it interferes with the sleep measurements and could compromise the test. So I'm feeling depressed and suicidal again, my anxiety is back full-force, and I frankly don't know how to deal with this. I'll be back on my meds in under a month so I know I can just tough it out until then, but it's hell right now.

My boss and coworkers are very understanding but things are slipping through the cracks. I had a generic viral illness for the last two weeks and I'm playing catchup with my responsibilities, but all I want to do is lay in bed and hide from the world. It takes so much effort moment-to-moment, and I know that I'm just treading water when I want to really be thriving in my job. I'm used to dealing with an overwhelming workload with these illnesses, but my career is different than college and my coping mechanisms aren't viable anymore.

To top it off, my parents, who have normally been very supportive, are trying to pressure me to postpone my sleep test (which could improve my quality of life in about a month if all goes well...) so I can take the GRE and move on to grad school. They're completely ignoring me when I say that I don't want to do that just yet and I need an extra year. My boyfriend (the other part of my support system) is either at school or work, so I have to spend extra energy supporting him and making sure that the apartment is clean/up to his standards so he doesn't get stressed (and yell at me :/).

35,"Hi all. I'm in a not great place right now and wondering if anyone might be able to help? For the record I am on the waiting list at my provider to get a therapist but don't have one yet - was doing really well for a long time and by the time I legit needed someone the waiting list was 3 months long and I can't wait that long. I have diagnosed ADHD which I'm medicated for, and generalized anxiety and depression, though I only take anything for those when I have a panic attack. 

Anyway. I can't make myself function. I have a really high pressure job and a lot of outside of work hobbies that I love and am really involved in. But I feel so overwhelmed and stressed that I can't seem to force myself to do anything I need to. Like, I'm behind on several big assignments for work. And the thing is they aren't even that hard! And I have had so much time to do them! And all the tools and resources I need so I can do them! But for the last 7 straight days I have done NOTHING. Not even fun stuff for my outside groups, no making dinner, no chores. I get so overwhelmed about work that I'm like ""I can't do anything of these other things I HAVE to get work done first."" But then I don't do it. I want to, I'm capable of doing it, but for whatever reason I just can't. I'm not procrastinating with more fun things, I'm literally doing nothing. This post is the most productive thing I've done in days.

I'm going to get in trouble soon if my work doesn't get caught up. I like my job! I have a great professional reputation and a lot of responsibilities because I'm so good at what I do! There's literally no reason for me to be so frozen and useless but no matter what I do I can't get myself to work. I try to tell myself to at least start and then take breaks, or do one thing at a time and not worry about the rest, but every time I go to do anything I close the window and just sit here. I try to at least go do dishes or take a shower or do SOMETHING and then I'm like ""no you have to work!!!"" but then I don't.

Does anyone possibly have any tips for helping me just buckle down and do this? I don't even know how to explain it I know why I need to do these things, know what will happen if I don't, know how to do it, but I still just am not doing it even though I really, really want to. I keep looking online for things about helping to focus or be disciplined and nothing helpful is coming up. If I don't get this stuff done in the net two days people are going to notice I'm late and it's going to be terrible. 

I'm in the US, 29 years old. Have had some problems with focus/getting things done in the past but never to this extent - usually just some mild procrastination without consequence or being easily distracted trying to multitask too many things. This act of literally not doing anything for no reason is so bizarre and upsetting to me. I'm still social with people, my mood feels fine, like nothing feels different except I can't get these things done. ",20Jun2017,1

I've even started trying to rebuild my relationship with my father! I'm putting it on hold at the moment, but it's still in the motion.

Anyway, my point is that I'm feeling better. In my letter I only talk about the negative stuff in my life. None of the stuff in the letter bothers me THAT much at the moment(a little bit, sure). I worry that sharing it will only serve to make me feel terrible again. Embarrassed even. At the same time... the time when I feel awful again will probably come anyway.

47,"Hello! My name is Benjamin, I'm a highschooler from Virginia. A little while back I had some serious problems with depression and many times I used the chat service Blahtherapy as a release by helping people on the weekends. However, in the past couple months the chat quality has dropped severely and I find the site is often overrun with bots or trolls. It really seems like they are putting all their effort into the online therapist portion of their site and leaving the far more popular chat aspect as an afterthought.

After a couple weeks of this I decided I could do better myself so I made the site [MellowTalk](https://mellowtalk.com) to replace the platform. My site is also for the purpose of mental health and is free with no ads, forever. It pairs listeners and talkers in one-on-one conversations with the talkers being given the ability to give the listeners points if they feel like they are doing a good job, making them ascend up a leaderboard. All names are silly and randomly generated and refresh at the beginning of every chat making things totally anonymous and safe. Inbound and outbound connections are also heavily encrypted so I promise there is complete and total privacy. I designed the site based on what I wanted and I only hope that other people might want it too. I didn't have anyone to talk to and I don't want anyone else to have that experience.

It's a very small site right now. Very, very small. And totally community funded, so not exactly profitable. That said, if it seems interesting please check it out because I think it has some good vibes going. I'd love some feedback and for questions or concerns, leave a comment or send me a PM and I'll definitely get back to you. Thanks for listening, take care.

I feel like they're intentionally trying to keep me sad/insane (aka not provide me with the help I need) and this has gone on for years I feel but my main point of focus of this is that as a result of them trying to ""keep me insane"" it gives me urges to say ""fuck you, I won't let you control me"" and visit them with a weapon and attack them to show them. Idk. thats what I feel like. 


Thoughts? and didn't know if there was a better sub to post this in

51,"Please help me out and tell me what you think guys. Is there something seriously wrong with me?

So basically, I have a habit of overreacting, getting emotional, getting anxious, feeling incredibly hurt over something that later seems stupid.

- My boyfriend does something that somehow hurts me or makes me think he doesnt care or that it's a bad sign

- I respectfully try to explain that it hurt me

- he doesnt understand or say the exact right thing immediately, doesn't apologize right away, etc and I feel like he doesn't get the problem

- I explain myself, get worked up, become dramatic and genuinely scared it spells the end of our relationship if he doesn't understand. This is where I start crying. This continues until:

- he understands and reassures me he'll work on it (I immediately feel better, feel understood if he says the ""right"" thing, hopeful)

- I realize I just criticized him and made him apologize, hearing him feel bad and give in hurts and I feel horrible, I self-blame, sometimes on the brink of self-hate. Cue ""why do I always react so stupidly I'm hurting him why can't I bring up hurts normally or just not be hurt in the first place"" etc

- doubts set in whether what I just made into a big deal actually was as bad as I thought, I apologize to him, often several times, I feel horrible

This happens maybe once or twice a week some weeks, with peaceful breaks in between or something. It's not always that extreme, of course, but it's always more extreme than it should be. 

He always tells me it's fine and we're fine and it really isn't that bad, but God I know I'm hurting him and it's killing me. Why am I so fucking stupid. Hurting him is the opposite of what I want. Losing him is the opposite of what I want. I want a good relationship, I want it to be great but my mind is always uncertain, looking for tiny clues that something is wrong and I find it almost impossible not to bring them up as they come. I want to stop this!!! I don't want to be that horrible girlfriend. I want to love him and feel loved and make HIM feel loved and it's like the more I try to do things right I mess it up. I'm so dramatic, even right now. Jesus. It's annoying to be in my head sometimes.

We broke up at one point last year because of what I think may have been OCD (relationship OCD, doubting the relationship and my feelings for him) and a therapist has confirmed to me during a time after reconciliation when I was basically symptom free that it does sound likely.

I don't know if this is an overreaction caused by OCD. Or if it's something else. Or even nothing at all. 

Basic additional info: not generally happy with my life right now (friends moved away, I'm in college and don't have any connections apart from my boyfriend, my parents and a select few friends who unfortunately all deal with depression), but never even thought about suicide, never would. I don't cut myself either, or do anything self-destructive other than what I mentioned above. I'm a shut-in and a very careful person because I easily get anxious about risks. 

Any guesses? Please help me, I want this cycle to stop. I've tried, but I just can't keep my mouth shut for long, it weighs on me too badly and consumes my mind until I speak up. I feel hurt and/or worried and then I have to resolve the issue that feels so huge right then.

Thank you for reading. 

EDIT: I'm actually looking for advice guys... and I would really appreciate responses and your insight.",20Jun2017,1

53,"long story short, I can't afford to see my psychiatrist anymore. She is about $140 a visit, out of pocket, and its borderline ruining me financially at the moment. I can't seem to find anyone around here that will take my insurance and have lapsed on both my klonopin and celexa due to this. 

I feel so lost right now.. I'm about one step away from forcing my self to the hospital and telling them I'm suicidal so that they can get me in to see someone. ",20Jun2017,1
54,"I'm afraid to ask for help because I don't want to be labeled as ""Crazy"" I have two other personalities in my head or what ever. I hear voices in my brain, I'm going through this without telling anyone. I'm afraid that if I'm diagnosed that I will never find anyone to spend my life with. I'm scared.",20Jun2017,2
55,"This time America's awake so let's try this again. I posted here 20 days ago and got no reponse and the mods told me it was ok to repost. Here's the original text

&gt; I say envy because it's the closest way I can describe this. I have also posted this in /r/anxiety and /r/teenrelationships previously with little to no response, and I'm getting quite desperate here.

&gt; So last July my GF I started going out. We'd been best friends for a while beforehand though. This is not only my first relationship but also the first person I've ever had romantic feelings for but I can honestly say that we are really perfect for each other. Problem is, I often get ""envy"" where if she has something or is something, I will want to have that or be that. There isn't as much a thought as is a feeling, and honestly I would describe it as similar to sensory overload (which I get too). I can't concentrate on anything, I won't laugh at something I would laugh at or anything like that, the only thing going through my head is the ""envy"". It can be based on different things like the fact that she got a new piano or that she's going to Canada (I have plenty more examples that I can give if you need more description or whatever).

&gt; If I were to try and pinpoint the cause the only thing I could think of would be self-esteem problems which are probably due to the fact that I spent 75% of my childhood standing around on my own.

&gt; It should be noted as well that it's happened about other people before, but not as strong and never more than once so far. And a friend of mine has told me he has something quite similar though he doesn't know anything either.

&gt; Please, I'm really grasping for anything here, even just a name of a mental illness or one that it *could* be even. This is threatening to ruin my relationship and I really don't want that. I apologise if this is very vague as well, it's very difficult to describe.

Ok that's the gist of it. Not much has come to my attention since then and anything that has is hard to pinpoint. Like I said, it is kinda vague so if you need any extra clarification, ask away.",20Jun2017,1

57,Today was my first good day in awhile. I've been in such a dark place and I get in these spouts of aniexty and depression that usually last for days. Hopefully it will last. What are some ways to avoid negative things in your life and how do you cope with it? ,20Jun2017,3

59,"Please somebody I am super worried about my mental health rn. I have been up and down for ages now with Bad mood swings, just generally unhappy and unsatisfied but now I can't cope anymore, I'm starting to get depressed, I can't feel joy in anything and I just feel homesick when I'm with my whole family, I guess maybe lonely, I don't know but terribly sad. What makes it worse is my insomnia is terrible I haven't slept for a few days and before that was getting 2 hours sleep or so for weeks and I just can't escape it, like being awake feels horrible and I literally don't want to face it. People are telling  to meditate and focus on positive and be happy because I'm on holiday? But do they not understand I physically can't feel any good sensation right now. I'm scared it won't go and scared not to sleep and I'm just honestly exhausted my brains in overdrive my chemistry is messed up and I just need to sleep. Even my body feels weak from tiredness. Please any reassurance will help. Any experience with anything like this and recovery from it?
I'm so lonely and just feel like I'm being tortured because my brain won't let me shutdown and recover. ",20Jun2017,1
