0,"Hello everyone I'm from the States, Alabama to be specific, and I have been dealing with sever anxiety, depression and panic attacks for years now. I've been through multiple prescription drugs, therapy sessions and relaxation techniques to try and help me but nothing these many years has had any real impact. Anxiety and panic attacks have made it almost impossible for me to hold down any real job for many reasons (which I would be more than happy to answer) therefor I am forced to apply for disability just so I can have some kind insurance and afford to feed myself. 

Now this past Memorial Day I went to a cook out with family and old friends we had great food and good conversation. One of my old friends mentions the fact that they take marijuana to help with their medical needs (which I won't get into). Now I've heard of folks using it for medical purposes before of course, after all its everywhere, I had just never tried it myself as an actual medicine. The only time I had tried it was in high school years ago just doing what teens do. My friend talking about using it as a medicine for them got me interested to try it in this controlled environment to see how I feel. Even my mother who was there at the time wanted to see if it helped me as well. So I took a few hits from a small one hitter and waited a bit. As the cook out went on I noticed I felt normal... just normal. Now this may sound like bad pot or a failed test to most, but having been tormented by anxiety for so long this was the first time i had felt normal in a very long time. I was no longer anxious, I felt I could be myself for the first time in a very long time. 
The unfortunate part of it all is Alabama has yet to truly recognize the drug as a medicine to help people. Yet they will throw around highly addicting pain killers like nothing",01Jun2017,4

I apologise for the longevity of this and I understand none of you can diagnose me as that can only be done by a professional...but some opinions would be awesome to make me feel less like I'm losing my mind. I don't know who to go to with this or what any of you can say but Reddit has always been a source of comfort and honesty for me so..here goes. 

I'm a 21yo female. Diagnosed with severe depression at 13 and was heavily let down by the healthcare system. Had a tough time growing up (like everyone else, i know) as my mother had a brain tumor and medication which made her extremely aggressive and meant I've spent most of my life locking myself in my room. The rest of my family all lived on the other side of the world so I've never really seen what a functioning, positive relationship of any kind between two people looks like. I tended to have the worst breakdowns in mental health during the end of relationships and that was usually the only time I would self harm. I had a real breakdown about two years ago as I was raped (also drugged, I dont remember any of it). I told my mum eventually because she was hounding me about not having a job and she told me if i'd been raped then I had probably done something to deserve it and that thousands of women get raped so i'd better get over it. I also came out of a relationship 8 months ago with someone who was severely psychologically controlling and made me isloate myself from my family and friends even more than I already was. I don't know if I can say he was 'abusive'...he never repeatedly hit me but he slapped me once during an argument. He was convinced I was cheating on him and would be super super nice whenever he had gotten angry but would constantly tell me I wasn't good enough for him and that he was being kind just by letting me be around him. I always had to dress nice and sit quietly because I was afraid I would do or say something to set him off.
 I think it really messes with you when the people you love who claim to love you back are the people you're most afraid of in the world. I can't be alone with drunk guys or go to clubs or even try and meet a guy because there's still a part of me that's afraid they'll hurt me if I'm alone with them.
Another important background detail is that at 16 I became obsessed with my weight and a desire to become skinny. I lost 30lbs in two months and became convinced people were trying to feed me. I'd exercise 2000kcal off a night and eat nothing except sugar free mints. Marijuana is what broke me out of that...munchies got to me and I put on 60lbs in the following months. Have continued to struggle with it but it did get better. 
I always came out okay when I was younger and I think the main difference is that I wasn't as confused and lost as I am now. 

Recently, I have no idea who I am. I feel like there's two (maybe three) mindsets and they all conflict constantly. I've got the intense actively sad depressed state which has caused me to self harm a lot recently...first time in a good few years now. I've also got a super excited, attention seeking state where tbh I'm just weird and annoying. And then there's the part of me that doesn't feel anything because nothing matters at all. And whichever state of mind I'm in, I HATE the other states. Like I'll get all excited and do something sexually impulsive or straight up annoying and the next time I'm feeling nothing or severely depressed, I'll think about how much I hate that I did those things. But then why am I doing them?? I feel like I have no control over how I feel and no solid ideas of who I am as a person. I can be crying and cutting myself one minute then calmly tidying up the house the next. My entire belief system and entity of who i am changes multiple times every day. It's scary not knowing if I'm going to wake up and want to kill myself or wake up and want coco pops for breakfast. 

I've also become consumed by my weight again. I look in the mirror almost constantly, always checking reflections and seeing how fat I look today. I compare myself to every single person I see. I don't like going outside because it takes me hours to find something to wear that I'm okay being out in public in. I only feel good about myself when I havent been eating but even then, if I wear something tight or short, I hate myself later for it and wonder why i'd be stupid enough to embarrass myself like that. I wholly believe and always have done that if I was thinner and prwttier that my life would be better. I used to just think I was fat but now I'm also realising that my face and body are just ugly. Being thinner would make it better but it still won't be good enough. I'm 5'5 and 70kg, not great but not medically worrying. Part of the reason I've come here is because the self harming has started again but it's also because I've stopped eating again too. I don't know if it's just a way to feel control over something in my life or what but the two together coupled with conflicting and unpredictable moods seems like a recipe for disaster.  

I physically cannot bring myself to ask for help. As you can imagine, my house had a lot of emotions in it growing up and I was always taught to just keep to myself and not talk about it with anyone. I can't confide in a friend because I don't think anyone's going to know what the hell to do with all the information I tell them. Plus there's just so much shame...self harming, admitting idk what's going on or who I am, admitting I have feelings at all is a rare thing for me. I think maybe I'm scared to be vulnerable with someone because every time I ever have, it's been a mistake.
I've had a lot of good in my life too which almost makes me feel worse for having these feelings. I feel like there's a long road back to whoever I am normally and most of me thinks that if I don't want to live at the moment, I definitely won't want to live when I'm having to get up every day and work on myself. I don't want to live a life where I have to do bullsh*t coping mechanisms. I should just be able to cope like everyone else and the fact that I don't just makes me believe that I wasn't meant to be here. The world is too much for some people and that's okay. I know how I'd kill myself and even though I really don't want to, I think the numbness and depressive sides to me will win eventually...just a matter of when. 

""Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames""",01Jun2017,1

7,"It is often said the first step to getting better is admitting you need help. I've admitted it to myself a long time ago. But it seems I've gotten no where in actually receiving professional help. 

I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that facing mental illness is very discouraging. Your entire being is unmotivated, worn down, hopeless. It can take a lot of courage to work up the nerve to seek professional help and reach out to a therapist. 

I guess I'm looking for people to commiserate with here. Have you found that even after several attempts to improve your mental health...you can't? I mean literally can't. Therapists don't call you back. They aren't taking new appointments. All those lifelines you thought would be there to pick you up... left you high and dry. 

Am I the only one who's experienced this?

In 2013 I was suicidal. I called multiple hotlines and not one answered. Fortunately I overcame that and I am still here today. Not because of anyone else's decision, but because of my own, and a very honest conversation with God and believing that He still had a plan for me. But it makes me hesitant to really truly believe that there are people out there who care. Where was help when I needed it? Are all these hotlines just hype?

In August 2015 I called a well respected, large, mental health care office and left a voicemail to make an appointment. No one called me back. Even after several attempts. I guess I could've tried harder. But again, already so discouraged.

October 2016 I tried again with a different office. Left a voicemail. No call backs. 

March 2017 I contacted my employers EAP program for free counseling referrals. Called the office 2 times with voicemail, no callback. The third time I reached someone who told me they weren't accepting new patients. Ok. 

I decided to go with a hospital. They have tons of doctors listed online right? A nice big webpage with subpages about how they're nationally acclaimed for their Depression treatment, right? 
Wrong. 
I request an appointment online. No call or email. I call the office the following week. The receptionist tells me they aren't accepting new patients and I have to contact my insurance for other providers. I calmly tell her that my insurance provider gave me their info. She snaps back ""Well you have to go back to them again, we aren't the only people you can contact, you know."" 

What she didn't know was that I am on my last legs here. That seemed to be my last hope. And yes, it seems that they are the only people I have left to contact. 

I said ""I understand that, but you're the 3rd place I've called...""
She cut me off and said ""right and I'm sorry-""
And that's when I hung up and fought back tears in the middle of my work day. 

Why is it so hard to get help?

How am I supposed to have faith that I'll get better when it seems that the resources that are ""here to support me"" - aren't really here for me at all? It's very discouraging. 


To end on a happier note, I was finally able to make an appointment. Funny enough I ran a new search on my insurance providers website, and slightly changed my location. The first hit was ""Catholic Charities"". Seriously not trying to promote any sort of religion here, but I mentioned earlier that my faith has been a major help in coping with my mental illness. Turns out anyone regardless of background/religion can make an appointment. The receptionist was kind to me (for once), got me an appointment within a week, and even got me one in the evening so I don't have to take a day off work. 

So maybe it was meant to be after all. ",01Jun2017,2

I know that I logically cannot have three major mental illnesses at the same time, so I'm just confused on the overlap: how can i determine what is wrong with me? I have several other examples but it's too many to list, I constantly even doubt these thoughts and instead think i'm making them up for attention. I'm not sure what's wrong",02Jun2017,2

16,"I am 27 years old, from Europe. I am not obese at all, I work out regularly (3 gym workouts per week, 1.5+ hours each, I also walk a lot), I do not eat too much salt (no added salt), I have a stressful life but I think I am beginning to do a great job on managing it (meditation, not working that much as before). 2 months ago, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. There were only two cases of it in my closer family, both in relatives older than 55. I was put on medications (ACE-inhibitor combined with diuretics).

I hate all this sh.t as it ruins my life. Before, I was a social guy (note that this only means 1 beer per week and maybe drinking more 2-3 times a year), now I don't like going out because I always have to take those meds (miserable and shame for me, ""unmasculine""). And I also couldn't drink anything and would be always asked why.

It seems to me that there is no escape from these circles, blood pressure has ""no known cause"" (it is ""essential""), without meds it cannot be controlled, and taking meds means taking even more meds later. (Not to talk about side-effects, I sometimes feel some lightheadedness I have never felt before but not sure this is the pill...). Another awful thing is that I feel always that I am ill / I am said to be ill.

There are some diets/methods said by their apostles to be effective but it always turns out they are just garbage. I fear becoming even more sick and dying at a young age - one can see everywhere that such a HEART DISEASE is a big factor, it has to be taken seriously, one has to worry, one has to accept being half-dead and take the pills and wait for the undertaker...

The day after i just woke up feeling like i was crazy. I was losing it and crying begging my mom to take me and go see a doctor. When we saw the psychiatrist he simply said it was anxiety with a little bit of depression. As time passed on i experienced sever anxiety at home. Googling every single mental symptom i was experiencing and trying to find an answer to the way i was feeling. Eventually i recovered by convincing myself it was probably just high levels of anxiety or an anxiety attack that made my thoughts flare up even though i was not experiencing physical symptoms. I was able to be normal again for about a year. And then all of a sudden after one bad argument with a roommate it happened all over again. I started thinking so much about the situation that my thoughts began to race at 5,000 miles per hour. They were pulling me in different directions. I couldn't get a grasp. And i couldn't hold a thought. It lasted for a minute and was the most terrifying experience i've ever had. All i do now is stay in my room and google things to try and find an answer to this.

FYI I don't mind being a nerd that's part of my personality. Nerds are not the villains. Just because I'm childish because I didn't have a childhood and because I'm a nerd (and doesn't care about being nerdy) does not make me stupid and does not give you the right to tell everyone that I am insane and incredibly stupid because you think you'd be a bad parent if you didn't have an excuse.

She would confront me about it, and I had no idea what she was talking about. I didn't think I was treating her badly and I thought I was over the issue. Problem is, below the surface, and only in hindsight, she was right.
Recently, I had a family member tell me I looked scared and that it was probably because I plan on living alone again soon. She was absolutely right. I was feeling bad and was reliving the last time I was alone. Problem is, I didn't notice it going on until it was brought up. At least I could admit it.
It has always been the case that people read me better than I can read myself and that has gotten me in a ton of trouble with some bad people.

Earlier this year I read about the dangers posed by Hyland's teething tablets. The FDA has warned that they've received 400 reports of adverse effects related to the use of this product and even suggested that 10 infant deaths may have been linked to the tablets. I went down to my local chemist to see if they were stocking these tablet and lo and behold, there they were on the shelf. I thought about asking to speak to the manager about it, perhaps to see if they could remove them from the shelves... but I didn't. I simply didn't. I just left the chemist and walked home.

The trouble is that I can't find any explanation for why I didn't just go up to the counter and ask to speak to the manager. 

The tablets have since been recalled but I still feel really guilty. And it's only recently that the guilt has been so crippling. For the past few months I didn't think about this event at all, but now it is totally consuming me. I only started feeling this way yesterday but I already feel like I will never stop thinking about it.
