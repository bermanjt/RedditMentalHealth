0,"I don't know how to explain my problem, so I will just explain what happens, here is one example. For some reason I clam up when I'm around my extended family. My sister's wedding rehearsal was tonight, as soon as I got to the church I got stiff and didn't talk to anyone and pretended to look around and scratch my face. I mean I said hi to people and stuff but that's it. Then when the woman explaining what everyone would do (don't know what they're called) told me I would have to walk my mom down, I became furious on the inside. It must have shown in my face though because she kept insisting it was completely normal. So I did it and tried my best to keep composure the rest of the time. When we were all in the lobby afterward I did the same thing as before, standing and staring. We were supposed to meet at a restaurant afterward, so I started driving there, and I just started crying in my car. I didn't want to show up at the restaurant like that so I went home, but I kept thinking about how embarrassing it would be to show up and have to find a seat after everyone else was seated and after what happened at the church. So I'm just staying home now, not looking at my phone. I still live with my parents, so I am assuming they will be angry when they get home. I am thinking about what to do at the wedding tomorrow, maybe just refuse to be a part of the walking down the aisle thing. Also, I know for a bit I thought about just doing it and getting it over with, but then I remembered it would be recorded so it would never be over with, all future generations can see me acting like a freak.

At the rehearsal, my first thoughts were that I should shove something sharp into my throat so I wouldn't have to do it tomorrow (I don't usually have suicidal thoughts). Then I thought about how possible it would be to make myself violently ill.

I don't know, I've just lately been starting to realize how big of a problem I might have. I come across as weird as in general I think, like to strangers and co-workers, but I guess for some reason I'm far worse around my family.

I'm seeing a neurologist about attention problems, I've vaguely alluded to social problems but I don't think he gets how bad it is. I have an appointment Monday, I should try to tell him about it, but I get nervous about bringing it up.",14Oct2017,2

2,"Hello everyone! As you can tell, I don't use Reddit that much, but I figured this was a great way to reach out to people and let them know that help is always available. I am the founder of Asking Jude (www.askingjude.org), a mental and emotional safe haven that provides free online supportive service. I have a team of interns currently training to become psychiatrists and psychologists that answer any and every question--from inquiries on domestic abuse to mental illness.

Well, recently I created a supplemental Youtube channel to give both text- and visual-based help to everyone. I find that putting a face to a name makes things far more personal. Our second mental health video is on self-loathing and self-love and provides some pretty detailed tips and tricks on how to manage both. It would mean the world to me if you guys checked it out and maybe even subscribed or left feedback.

Please, support the idea that everyone deserves help and check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wNGkqit7wA",14Oct2017,0

4,"Boyfriend and I are signing our new lease next week. This is our first time with an ESA (emotional support animal) and I'm nervous that this complex will deny it if they've never seen one before. 

It's a smaller complex, with 24 or so dwellings in NY (not city), and not rent-stabilized, so I don't think they are exempt in any way. A real estate agent has been handling the whole showing/application paperwork/etc process, and she's who we'll be meeting with to sign the lease.

5,"i mean severe self-destroying and hopeless state of depression. I'm now in such a state. Im almost 25 and haven't gone to school after 12years of age at all! more than that, I don't like to read, Ive always envied erudite peers and after the early childish age i always saw that the most beautiful girls (i'm obsessed with girls) hung out with clever and erudite boys. Such boys liked books, they went to university and all, but I always belonged to the category of silly boys, of loosers, and i wasn't able to get any proficiency in any subject or hobby. I failed in sport, then I became depressed and dropped out from school, they sent me to a psychiatric clinic and so after that for 12 I've only sat in front of PC and suffered seeing the lives of my peers in social network. I'd like to read books now (i've read as few as about 30 in my life) but i simply can't because im always suicidal and masturbating or crying. It's impossible to concentrate. It's hell, and the f-cking doctors cannot help except to give me these pills which can't solve my problem. I've got a f-cking inferiority complex. Ive never tried to date someone because im a f-cking drop-out and haven't achieved proficiency in anything. Sport was a fiasco. Music was a fiasco. Studying English and becoming a lyrics-writer was a fiasco. I haven't achieved anything. I cannot go to university because I'd first have to go to school again 2-3 years. And I can't I just cannot stand these textbooks and all,I cannot stand any exams and competition in any forms, it all is just f-cking cruel in my opinion. I mean, here I am, one who broke down in those f-cking adolescence years and have failed to lead normal life like others. Everything was fine till the age of 17 but then, if you are a man, your f-cking sexual desire just maddens you. And if you don't attend any university and social life you re just going to go mad and all because of the depression caused by loneliness and sexual dissatisfaction. Maybe im a bit more hysterical by nature than the average men, but im not going to stand all this suffering all my life. Im going to kill somebody just ouf of unhappiness and then commit suicide, or rape someone and commit suicide or just commit suicide. I wait only for my mother to die. I've already lost all my money which was $100k, I did it intentionally, just to have no indulgence, to ruin any dreams and plans. I see no solution to this crap of a life.",14Oct2017,1
6,"My brother has been on and off his depression medication for a while now and his mood always seems to be different from day to day. For the last few months, he has been seeing a counselor at a local church to work through this. Suddenly today I get home from work and my parents inform me that my brother messaged them saying that he has come to the conclusion that he has PTSD and is staying at his GF's house and doesn't want to talk about it with us. For the record, he has never served in the military nor has he ever been in any traumatic events, at least that we know about. My dad tried to explain to him nicely that he doesn't, but he responded with messages like ""I'm sorry you don't believe"" and ""I need to figure this out on my own"".

7,"Does anyone know anything about Emotional Detachment Disorder, my mom came across it a few weeks ago, and while I'm not going to just jump to a conclusion and say ""That's me!"" It seems pretty damn spot on. I have an almost impossible time expressing any kind emotion, My whole mentality a lot of the time is really just ""meh"" a few years ago I had a friend of mine, who was living at my house at the time kill himself, and when my mom told me, well.....to be as honest as I can be, I didn't give a shit, I only went to his funeral because I knew how it would look to everyone if I didn't, Flash forward a few months after this and a brother of one of my friends threw himself in front of a bus, this time however I did just skip the funeral, solely because I didn't feel like I could be bothered to go. Then just last week one of my coworkers passed away, and my very first thought was ""Well more hours for me"" What makes it so hard is, to me my way of thinking, and processing these kinds of situations is totally normal, but I know that it's not really a ""socially acceptable"" method of thinking. I've been seeing a therapist for almost 2 years now, but just started seeing a Psychologist as well, and through her I set up some personality testing, so hopefully we can gain some insight on how my mind works, but I know there are absolutely brilliant people in the world of Reddit so I figured I'd dip my toes in the water here and see what happens, and if I posted in the wrong Subreddit, well then.......Fuck",14Oct2017,1
8,"I (22F) have a younger sister (18F) who is very hostile towards ONLY me. I try my best to think positively, although I wasn't always like this. Therefore I am extremely saddened when my sister always speaks to me in an irritated tone and it is VERY disheartening to be around her. She acts hostile to me (by ignoring me, glaring at me, speaking unkindly) even when I do small acts of kindness towards her (efforts to show her I care). This has been going on for 2+ years. I've tried to talk things out with her but she literally doesn't seem to care about mending our relationship at all  and she said she hates my personality. Also I find her mindset to be extremely pessimistic and her thought processes are unfathomable to me. Overall, my sister makes me feel terrible about myself and I dread being around her. Since she's immediate family I can't completely avoid her and see her semi-frequently when I see my family. My parents are of no help and don't understand my distraught feelings. **PLEASE, do you have any advice on how I can stop feeling terrible around an obnoxious person? (I keep interactions to a minimum but her mere presence makes me feel slightly miserable)**",14Oct2017,2

11,"I was never exactly mentally stable and I went through multiple traumas in my life but it was never easy to 'trigger' me. probably the most recent thing I went through was a few years ago when my parents locked me up to rot in a mental hospital for over a year, that probably fucked me up more than anything. But whenever I think about that place I just feel mad for a few minutes and that's it.

But something just happened that absolutely baffles me, and I'm a bit ashamed that something silly like that made me break down but I have no where else to go to vent. Basically I watched the new XMen New Mutants trailer, which is basically a movie about young mutants held in a somewhat-medical facility against their will, and it made me want to lay down and cry. I love horror/movies with unconventionally creepy plots, I've seen hundreds of horrible movies with all sorts of horrible scenarios (some of which I might've went through myself) and nothing made me react like that. I'm not even sure what triggered me so much since the trailer doesn't show much, I'm still confused as to why it triggered me at all. And it doesn't help that two of the main actresses are some of my favourite human beings and seeing them in distress and sort of in the same situation I was in makes me want to scream and yell and save them, and I keep telling myself ""it's not real stop acting so stupid"" but it's just so confusing. How do I stop this?",14Oct2017,2
12,"So for as long as I can remember, I have always struggled to make conversation with people and fit in, especially new people I’ve never really talked to or people I am trying to impress like girls I like, or even my boss. I’m an now 18, nearly 19 and find it almost impossible to make conversion without either slurring my words or not knowing what to say. I’ve never been in a relationship because I simply don’t know how to talk to people anymore. It feels like my life is just slowly deteriorating and the symptoms are now affecting me physically as well. It makes me think about my actions like walking. I feel like I am walking weirdly and everyone is judging me. I am also quite self-conscious about my appearance. My teeth, hair, body etc. I am really skinny because I don’t eat much. I don’t think I have an eating disorder linked to my anxiety but I definitely need to eat more.

I’m scared of the future. I feel like I won’t get a job at the end of my apprenticeship because nobody wants to hire someone who is awkward and can barely hold a conversation without mumbling or slurring words. It’s the most annoying thing to experience because as you can see I can type paragraphs that make sense and in my head I can think about saying stuff that makes sense but when it comes to talking out loud I can’t do it anymore. It’s like the words get mixed up when they leave my mouth. It’s like as soon as I start talking I go into panic mode and can’t control what I say.

I have been smoking weed regularly for about 6 months now. I have obviously been suffering from this problem before smoking weed so it hadn’t caused it but I wonder if it’s making it worse or it’s just getting worse by itself. When I smoke with friends I feel more comfortable than being sober because obviously when you’re stoned it makes you quite and not say much anyway so I can use the weed to hide away my anxiety. I feel like this isn’t the right way to live. Relying on drugs to escape my reality. But then again I’m not really escaping, I just use it to mask my anxiety. I have decided definitely not to use weed when meeting and talking to someone new. Usually because when I talk to someone new I am very anxious so the weed just enhances the anxiety. But that’s only really the case with new people that I’m trying to impress.  

I’m starting to think maybe I should just accept it and talk openly about it because I don’t see it going away anytime soon. This reddit post is the first time I’ve ever openly talked about it. But that’s the thing, it’s so much easier to type than to talk.

Apart from that I am a relatively normal guy (I hope lol). I have a huge passion for cars, in fact my job is working with cars so that’s pretty cool, I go out on the weekends but I definitely prefer a chilled night (usually smoking a joint) to a loud, public night because I don’t like confrontations with people I don’t really know. Strangely I definitely enjoy going out with friends and just chilling. Although I’m not very good at talking to them, I much prefer being with them. I hate being alone wspecially when everyone else is out enjoying themselves. I feel like I am watching their lives go by as they enter relationships and do stuff I simply can’t do anymore.

When I first thought I might have a problem I searched online about what I might be suffering with, to my surprise it seems a lot of people suffer the same thing I do which makes me think maybe I really do have a legit anxiety problem. Anyway I know there isn’t really a cure for Social Anxiety, I know it’s something I am just going to have to live with. The problem is I just don’t know how much longer I want to live with it. I feel like I don’t have much of a live worth living. It’s making me so depressed I can’t stand it. It’s like I’m trapped inside a body without a mouth. I can’t talk to people how I want to, I just come across as an empty, quite guy but inside I’ve got loads to say. ",14Oct2017,2

I have a prescription for Klonopin and I’m fighting taking it on Tuesday because of the test. I do carry the bottle with me, it’s easier. Has anyone experienced drug testing with benzodiazepines and how did it go?

26,"I have a friend who is pretty troubled. He doesn't seem depressed but he does seem to have a hard time adjusting to social situations and he gets aggressive about it. I don't want to go into too much detail but he definitely needs help.

I've talked to him about seeing a psychiatrist and he brushes it off saying that they can't do anything to help. When talking about medication, he's firmly against taking any because he thinks that they're just a way of getting him to conform to other people's definition of normal. That being said, he does abuse drugs (I'm usually one to advocate the use of weed and psychedelics after doing your own research, but he **abuses** them).

I've gotten to the point where I'm pretty much ready to just stop talking to him, but I don't want to just tell him that I don't want to hang out anymore without doing my best to help first.

27,"Hi, I had a car accident which almost resulted into drowning. Lost control of car, went through bridge fence straight into river with a strong current. The fence impact knocked me out ( im guessing atleast 30 seconds) and when I came to councusness the car was already flowing in the middle of the river. The water just started coming in from the bottom, quite slow pace, I unbelted the seatbelt first ofc. Next thing on list was getting out of the car ofcourse. The doors wouldnt open cause of pressure but first I thought theyre locked so I tried using the keys button ( yeah it didnt work ) so I waited for the water to fill in slightly above the window level and the doors opened with ease( thank you mythbusters) The window switch ofcourse didnt work. When I opened the door I swam or sat out the chair and the car went down in like 2 or 3 seconds. Then part 2 took place cause its a channel that leads to a powerplant (like a mile from turbines) and the water was pretty fast, id say like 15 mph. I did my best to swim to the side of the channel where the flow was weaker but still had a strong current, like a good running pace where i managed to take off my hoddie, it was puffy so it got really heavy and was pulling me down. There was nothing to grab on either so I had to wait for the stairs which are placed on like every 250 yards. It was raining and happened mid night. I do remember these things but I feel like it did not happen. Is this PSTD,  I read up about your brains blocking memory during the fight or flee moments if the experiance is really traumatic, but idk, I feel pretty chill and drive my car normally, at night at rain and i can picture the experiance but i cannot remember the feels.

30,"Since I've just turned 16, I've decided to finally address an issue that's been bothering me for a while. My mental health.

So the back story is that, 2-3 years ago some bad things have happened, that I'd not like to go into. And recently I've been noticing the effect (such as anxious intrusive thoughts, mistrust, and for lack of a better term: unloading my struggles on them for help) on my interactions and relationships with people I care a great deal about. So I'm scared this is going to alienate them or cause them distress. Which would make me feel awful. Something like this has happened before and I've tried addressing the issue alone but to no avail. Loneliness has been an ongoing issue.

Another issue that is tied into this is my, bad moments, for lack of a proper term. These involve; crying, shaking, desperate thoughts, trouble confirming breathing, occasionally thoughts of self harm, irrational intrusive thoughts. And usually keep me up at night. These moments last an hour or two (and occur about once or twice a month) and I'd usually ask someone I trust to intervene though I'd like to ask a professional to help me find ways to stop burdening others with this.

These two issue in particular bother me, and have for the last 2 years. Though they've been getting better.

Back to my question, my parents have shown a very cynical approach to mental health. Therefore I'd like to avoid telling them about seeking help. Though I'm not sure if there is a legal way to go about this. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for hearing me out.",14Oct2017,14
31,"Hi all,

In 2015 I was prescribed Brintellix for my depression, and it worked well for a bit after the first couple of weeks. After a couple of months, my dosage was raised to the max (40mg if I remember correctly?) and I was having issues keeping it down. I became extremely sick for two weeks from a stomach bug, and after that was unable to continue taking it - it was so harsh on my stomach, I couldn't keep anything down let alone the medication. 

Fast forward:

Now 2 years later, my new and awesome doctor (I do really like him) has mentioned a possibility of putting me on Trintellix- the same medication? He mentioned potentially having me take anti nausea medication with it until I get used to it, but nothing is certain yet (this was discussed last month.) I'm seeing him on Monday and I'm a little nervous in case he does in fact prescribe this medication for me, as I have had horrible side effects in the past- which I did let him know about. 

Has anyone taken either of these? Or can anyone give me some feedback on the differences if any? I'm hopeful for similar results from before, minus the nausea and vomiting, obviously. But I'm worried I'll go through physical hell again with my apparently weak stomach.

Thanks for any feedback!",14Oct2017,2
