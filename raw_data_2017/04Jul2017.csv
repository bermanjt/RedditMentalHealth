0,"I'm finding it hard to manage my bipolar type 2 disorder. Went to the Er twice a week ago and they sent me home the next day and did not admit me when i had suicidal ideations. I've been struggling with bipolar and depression for years. I pay my mom rent and work but it's so hard at this point, been out of work for awhile and my mom plans on kicking me out with no where to go if i don't go back to work soon. I do not want to kill myself but it's really hard now especially with my tmj jaw popping non stop all day long, which is another matter they can't fix. It's debilitating. They just put me on a mood stabalizer but i don't like it. And currently I'm on a waiting list for a psychiatrist to go back to again. 

I'm remaining positive and going back to work soon for how long i can manage but, i want to know if there is free housing for adults with mental illnesses that don't require care all the time and still can handle things on their own. I've been better in the past and depressed but never this bad, still have had another debilitating time in the past, but not like this. I'm a 32 year old male and don't need full housing and 24/7 care, just a place to live. ",04Jul2017,3,

2,"i started taking medication for my mental illnesses when i was 17, i'm almost 20 now. i was started on a small dose of escitalopram, and soon was given higher and higher dosages, this was maybe over a year and half span. after i felt like it wasnt helping much anymore, my doctor tried to switch me to wellbutrin, but my mom is deathly allergic to it so i refused to take it and that lasted about a month. i'm now on a higher dose of duloxetine and although i feel it has helped my anxiety attacks be less extreme, i'm still constantly anxious and more depressed now than i've been in awhile. i've been doing some research and it seems valium would be helpful? 
when i was first medicated my main problem was depression, my depression eased up but then a little over a year ago i started having crippling and life endangering panic attacks and that's why we switched to a med that focused more on anxiety than depression so... and like i said, i still have horrible horrible anxiety, just not as extreme outbursts of panic.

I don't view her romantically, but I think about her a lot and miss her. I feel disgusted and sick to my stomach that I'm feeling this way.  I've been seeing her weekly, but I didn't book another session with her because of the realization of my feelings and not wanting to be dependent on her.  She contacted me and asked if I wanted to come but I said I wasn't sure yet. I don't know if this is transference, but I know it's a common thing I just didn't anticipate it happening with me and I hate it. It's embarrassing and uncomfortable, so i've been avoiding seeing her. Expressing my true feelings to anyone such as my closest friends makes me very uncomfortable and thought of telling my T makes me very anxious.

I'm incredibly anti social, never go out unless I go to the gym ( got to get that summer body) and my question is can I stay anti social? Go there, do my work and fuck off home?

I just want to put my earphones in and get on with life, then fuck off to Türkiye and just be happy. Any advice?

9,"Hello to all members of mental health.

I am a mobile app developer interested in mental health.
Recently I heard a lecture by a psychiatrist, and I found that writing emotion diary is very good for mental health.
So I created a mobile app that makes it easy to write emotion diary.

When you want to record emotions, simply select an emoji and leave a photo. If you want, you can simply leave a note of why you felt such feelings. Artificial intelligence can also be used to find real feelings in selfie. Feeling calendars and feeling maps are also automatically created.

I hope it will help those who value their feelings especially like the members here.

Please feel free to use it because it is a free app.
Please give it a try and give us your feedback on the app.

(Here's the TL;DR version of my panic attack. I'm on disability and my pharmacy denied me insulin because they say I'm not covered by disability anymore. So I haven't slept because I know I have to be at the office at 8:30am and I'm anxious and terrified. I'm scared they'll tell me it's not a mistake and I'm not on disability anymore.

I expected this to happen because it's a house full of elderly, sick people. Reality is that most of them will be there for the rest of their life.

I work at my fathers business (we have about 100 employees) and I have been given a role of authority mainly I have to do paperwork or work with listing on amazon and ebay. 
Typically I might come in on Monday and only have one hour worth of easy work that I need to do but I will still not have finished the work by Friday afternoon. 
I am not doing anything else apart from watching youtube videos and stressing about the work from the moment I wake up in till the moment I go to sleep.
I will sit at my desk and just stare at my screen for five hours and do nothing instead of just doing one hour of work and then going out to enjoy my life.
I should have been fired long ago but I make up excuses and my father chooses to believe them.
Even now I have one to two hours of work that I need to get done and instead of doing it and then going to meet up with friends for the 4th of July barque I am siting at my desk reading Reddit, and I don't think this will change, I will probably stay hear in till eight or nine pm then go home stress for a while and then go to sleep.

Luckily my parents have the means to provide for me, but I don't know how much longer I can keep being a burden for them and my siblings.

For as long as I can remember I had a sense of shame about myself and it has only become stronger trough the years, I know it is sometimes overblown but I feel like I can't stop it. To top that I've always been too sensitive, everytime I get even a mild criticism or I feel like I'm not doing something the right way I crash. I feel useless and I feel like I have nothing to offer.

26,"I am a 21 year old male. In case it is relevant, I was diagnosed with panic attacks last year, but they have since subsided and I do not take any medication. I now just deal with moderate amounts of anxiety, but the real problems are much more subtle.

List of problems I am struggling with each day:

* Severe lack of focus. Can't seem to follow along in conversations very well. I often have to ask people to repeat themselves multiple times, even if I know what they are saying is really important.
* Very low working memory. I work as a programmer and I often times find my mind just hitting a wall where I cannot seem to remember how I was planning to build a system as I'm building it.
* Extreme lack of self control. I go through phases where I am completely bored with work and play video games all day, or I get extremely interested in work and make it my life's purpose to complete it. There is seemingly no hope of balance or routine (and I've tried to make a routine many times). There are so many examples of times where I know what I need to do, but I just can't do it. I know web browsing is terrible for me and I really need to pack for my flight, but I still just sit there and web browse. I almost feel like I have no control beyond my initial urge to do something. I also never complete goals. Ever. Not just goals I set for myself either, but ones I bet on with friends. I never even come close and just seem to get bored and give up.

I just thought of a great story that seems to demonstrate the on/off mentality I go through with activties. My junior year of high school I was taking Algebra II/Trig H, and the fact that I never, and I mean NEVER, did homework was catching up to me. I barely got a D first semester. Then, the next semester I got motivation to try hard in school and got a 103 percent the first quarter despite the fact that I also had to go back and learn all of the stuff that the material had built on. Then, here's the real kicker: the next quarter I got so bored with school I convinced my parents to let me drop out and pursue computer programming. I mean, what gives? It just sounds so crazy in retrospect the swings I go through in thought process.

I'm posting this because I just moved to Chicago for an awesome job, where I get to work from my house most of the time, and yet I just play video games or browse the web and abuse the freedom and I feel my job is being threatened by these impulses. I have mustered up the willpower to try out some lifestyle changes, but what are your thoughts on the above? Any helpful resources you could provide?

27,"Hey guys. I'm actually at work right now but it can't go on like this, here's my story and thanks for any advice.

I'm a male in my late 30s, with a lovely wife and two fantastic young children. I love my family and we have a great relationship, but I feel everything else is slipping away.

I was always a cerebral kid, ""in the moon"" as we say here, but I did great in school. Until it got a bit harder in my early 20s. The internet happened and I could spend hours each day mindlessly browsing, before finally doing my work at the last minute. It worked because I was single and had all the time in the world. Then I got married, had a job and children and I've always been responsible with finances, I loved doing spreadsheets but computers have always been had to put down for me. Then there were smartphones, and I guess it fed my addiction and here I am...

I feel like my brain must ALWAYS be working at 100%. I have the hardest time just relaxing and thinking of nothing. And in the past few years I've found it increasingly harder to focus on tasks and non-urgent work and chores. As soon as I have access to a computer or cellphone I have to find something to feed my brain and I find it harder and harder to focus on my other tasks.

Sometimes I feel like I have read about half of wikipedia. Multiple times. It can be reddit, or sports forums. Last year I thought that if I was wasting my time browsing I might as will use if for something more fun so I started playing a MMO for the first time and while I simply cannot play too long (mostly between 9 and 11pm when chores are done), I often spent HOURS each day during work researching and planning for the game on my phone. I'm always thinks about something and distracting myself and I can't seem to help it.

Another thing is that because of my commute and family, I have to get up at 6am every morning. I sleep on average between five a six hours per night and often feel mentally exhausted the day after. If I try to catch up on sleep and got to sleep earlier I can't do anything at night and sometimes end up sleepless because my brain isn't tired enough.

My wife works in mental health and had been gently prodding me for years to get treated for mild ADD, and about 18 months ago she suggested that a colleague of hers could prescribe me ADD medication, and I accepted because I was fed up with mental fatigue. At that time I didn’t play the MMO but the problem was the same with just wasting time on the internet, so I accepted and started taking Concerta 27+18 mg each day.

The first morning was like a revelation. Everything seemed somehow*clearer* and more focused. It was great, and I did gain a lot of mental energy. I didn't need a nap on weekends because I was so mentally fatigued (from what?). But it progressively got worse and worse, and I just used that new energy to waste more time and sleep less. I've tried reducing my intake and I really feel off if I stop taking it, but if I ramp it up to 45 mg I feel better mentally for a short while but fall in the same problems.

It's gotten pathetic at home. I'm six months late on doing my finances and occasionally miss a bill because I keep procrastinating to look at them. I put off important calls or appointments until it's too late and then pretend I forgot.

At work it's worse. I work alone in my big office and do my work when I have a strict deadline or have to coordinate with someone else but everything else gets put off until later. I answer emails but I've let my voicemail balloon to over 100 messages, then pretend I haven't had time to listen to them today, and ask them to repeat the problem.

I installed Teamviewer do a little work at home during my lunch hour, and it was fine at first, but now I spend half the day browsing reddit or various forums on it. I've also started playing my MMO on it even though it's laggy as hell.

Every day coming back home I promise myself I'll take care of work tomorrow. It'll be better after Christmas, or after vacation. Nope. Now I'm in the 1% in my MMO and can get back to work? Nope, got to argue with idiots on a sports forum.

Last night I was too tired to play on the computer and went to bed early, or so I thought. While getting ready in the bathroom I wasted 30 minutes reading about basketball players on wikipedia. I don't follow that sport. And I had read them before. Why do I do that?

I'm not stupid, and am aware of what I do. It's moronic and self-destructive, my wife and boss would think I'm insane. Why can't I stop? Is it the ADD? Procrastination? Depression?

Virtually the only time I can stop my brain is when I hike in the mountains and I'm too physically tired to do more than watch my steps. I love it but can only do it once every few weeks. I don't really have the luxury of getting out of the house on the weekends or work nights except for late-night walks and those are great, but my brain never stops.

28,"At certain times, with increasing frequency as of late, I've felt like absolute garbage. I get excessively irritable, I feel overwhelmed by the simplest and most trivial tasks, I feel numb, worthless, useless, and sometimes feel like if the task of killing myself wasn't an overwhelming task, I'd do it. But for the past probably year I've been going to a therapist, and every time I get there I'm in a generally good mood (which is usually true when I'm away from my house/dorm room) and I downplay this. Maybe I'm just secretly afraid to tell someone I want to die, but I think a lot of it is I get trapped in a cycle of telling myself I was just overreacting when I was feeling down, and I'm actually not that bad. The therapist would then equate my bad feelings with like, for example, me thinking I chose the wrong college, and she would reassure me I could transfer. Which is true and nice and all, but my problem is so much bigger than that. I would feel a little better at my new college, but my problem is definitely internal. I guess I don't know how to communicate that effectively, and I get anxious that I'll come off as angry or make her feel bad if I tell her that her advice won't help me. I'm seeing a new therapist for summer and I wanna make sure I break the cycle of telling myself I'm fine when I'm not, but I don't know how. What do I say? ",04Jul2017,6,

33,"I have gone through an emotional ringer in the last six months (fiance/gf of three+years and friend of 7) left me completely out of the blue last October.  We had already moved in together, were buying a starter house, planning our future and more and then in a matter of ten days it went from making and sending save the dates to her walking out the front door forever.  So now here i am, a single earner with a house payment and a bunch of bills, so the only thing I can do is get a second job while looking for a single job that will meet the budget.  It takes two month to find that one job, but the downside is it's 84 hours a week- INCREASING my overall workload but at least giving me more consecutive hours of rest time on a day-to-day basis, as well as a more stable, predictable schedule.  

January rolls around and the emotional and physical strain degrades my health to the point I have a minor heart attack.  I haven't been at the job long enough to accrue any leave, so despite the fact that I was escorted off the floor by my supervisor and the fact they won't let me return to work until I've seen a doctor, i'm still required to take points for the time I was forced to miss work.  I return to work two days (and two points) later, only to have another event in February.  The same situation applies.  And again in March.  I begin looking for another job, because by this point the future is obvious.  I find another job with a more relaxed schedule and workload, but unfortunately, the pay is below poverty level, and my bills and rent fall behind.

The mental stress that my work and home life are heaping on me results into me falling into major depression, and after a doctors visit i can't afford (increasing my budget stress) he places me on antidepressants and wants me to see a dedicated mental health professional on his staff.  I want to, but can't afford it so i take my pills and go.  After a month on the pills nothing has changed so he takes me off of them.  it's late may by now and my depression has worsened to the point it's physically affecting my brain chemistry.  I am experiencing aural (orchestral or choral music heard at a far distance, as if through several thick walls), tactile (the sensation of my limbs being grabbed or bugs crawling on my head/back), and visual hallucinations (giger-esque creatures, but with extremely large or a great number of eyes, the walls of my house changing shapes) and delusional(?) hallucinations (sensations of overwhelming emotion that seem to originate from without, for example a sense of malice so overpowering it feels like a ~~heat wave or a pressure system~~ a spotlight, aimed squarely at me).  I get headaches daily.  I don't eat like I should, and when i do it's packaged/processed noodles, ramen, or pasta.

And now, here we are, at today.  The things i used to enjoy- computer games, making music, spending time with dogs and family- are nothing more than distractions at best, outright chores at worst.  The only events in my recent life that have any real importance to me are the bills i can't pay and the upcoming dates when i will, inevitably, have my power or gas shut off.  (water and phone are already gone).

The few friends and family i still talk to (or rather, still talk to me) think it's a simple matter of getting a different job.  And though I have to bite my tongue, I find their complete lack of understanding baffling and extraordinarily enraging.  I just want to grab them by the throat, push them against a wall, and scream at them that ""oh, is that all I need to do?  I had no idea it was so easy!""  At 34 years old, i have more than ten years experience in Logistics, supply chain management, and warehouse management.  I once singlehandedly ran a 70,000 square foot warehouse for a pharma company, doing everything cycle counting to staging to shipping, receiving, packaging, storage, inventory management...I drove the forklift, i controlled the pests, I cleaned the computer, I even changed the goddamn lightbulbs.  unfortunately, all this experience doesn't have a degree attached to it, so the only job offers that my linkedin or indeed profiles get me are entry level material handler jobs that don't pay enough to keep my barebones budget (that is, electric, gas, water, and rent- not even including groceries or internet, which is no longer a luxury) afloat.

Sure, there are a metric fuckton of jobs out there, but the reason those jobs are open is because they're only suitable for fifteen year olds living with mom and dad or trust fund babies that don't actually need to worry about things like ""making a living"" and bills.  Why would i take on the additional stress of a minimum wage part time job in addition to the stress of losing everything I've spent the last five years working towards when in the end that additional stress will change the outcome not one iota?

Every choice that's been presented to me in the last six months hasn't been a choice so much as a railroad switch.  ""Well, if you wanna afford groceries, you're gonna have to keep having heart attacks.""  ""weelllllll I guess we can stop with the heart attacks, but it's gonna cost you the house you've already sunk about 8 grand into....""

The only thing that's stopped me killing myself?  Pride, stubbornness, and a massive, massive ego.  The more the world tries to take from me, the more i struggle to hold on to it.  Barring a miracle or a lottery ticket, I'm going to lose my house in the next month.  After that, the only thing I have left is my car (which, while it is my prized possession and has had a lot of money sunk into it, is effectively worthless to anyone but me) and my life.  Everything else- my fiance, my solvency, my ability to make ACTUAL choices and decisions about how my life goes, even my health- has been taken from me by sources, people, and events outside my control.

I am sick and tired of my life, the society in which i live, and my place in it.  I find no value, no joy, nothing worthwhile in ANY opportunity or demand that our culture, our society, or this world makes of me.  I see no reason to desire, to try, or to dream, because no amount of effort will yield any result worth having.  The *best* case scenario in my life is that I get another shitty job that gives me no sense of satisfaction so that I can continue earning money (which is arguably the worst idea humanity ever had) to pay bills that are just going to keep coming back.

**Allright, so the title: Anyone that's read Dante's inferno, the tale of Orpheus, or a few other pieces of classical literature will be aware of the situations of Ixion, Sisyphus, and Tantalus.  Ixion, bound hand and foot to a great stone wheel, is forced to ride along in a dizzying journey as the wheel rolls endlessly to and fro in the landscape of Hades.  Sisyphus is forced to push a boulder up a hill, only to have the boulder always roll back to the bottom. Tantalus, cursed with eternal, parching thirst, is standing chest-deep in a clear, crystal spring of water, but every time he bends to take a sip, the water level recedes and his needs go unmet.**

**These three themes- a lack of control over one's own path, ceaseless toil with no hope of rest or reward, and needs that will forever go unmet- are depicted as the cornerstones of suffering in Hades.  I live every day of my life in the Greco-roman idea of Hell.**",04Jul2017,12,

35,"Before I begin, I should mention that I have never searched for professional help because I never acknowledged this as something I can't 'get over' without help. I'm open to the idea now, but I want to get a second opinion.

History
-My dad and mostly recovered from agoraphobia before I was born. I remember he never felt comfortable taking plane rides, so most of our travels were done by car.

-My mom was diagnosed with a form of PTSD after my dad passed away. I had to drop out of college to take care of my mom while she was recovering, so much of my life has been delayed.

-While working a part time job, one female coworker would constantly monitor me (Big Brother style) whenever we worked together. She had seniority over me, but didn't have any managerial status or anything. I could've told her off, but I was too nervous at the time for reasons I can't explain. She would write lists to tell my manager if I did something wrong or took a few extra minutes during my lunch break. The manager was thankfully on my side –she would throw the lists into the garbage.

This coworker would also balance her criticism with some kind of faux friendliness –so I never quite knew what I would get. This lasted for 5 years and even though it ended 5 years ago, it still sticks with me for some reason.

-A few years ago I put out a fire in my girlfriend's apartment and, in the process, got second degree burns. The recovery process took 3 years. Now, although I have a huge scar on my arm, I can function normally. Although I tell everyone I'm fine, I still have a lot of resent for what happened –it's not targeted resent, I'm just frustrated that it happened to me.

-I was often bullied by a group of girls when I was in elementary school and the teachers and principal of the school didn't do anything about it for 2 years. I don't know if it's related, but I do have a nervousness around some women my age.

Condition
-I feel completely powerless. Even if I make a decision, it's usually changed by someone else later. Even if I feel like I can make a decision for myself, I usually choose not to because I expect that decision will be changed later and I will be disappointed. I hate it when people ask me what I want to eat –I don't even think about that anymore because I feel like I just won't have a say anyway. I just eat whatever.

-I am terrified of what people think of me –very self conscious.

-When I'm angry, it's like a switch. I think and say things very differently and immediately regret and feel ashamed of what I did or said. I'm not violent, but I say violent and offensive things.

-I'm always thinking about my past and the future. I always strategically plan interactions with people in order to make things work out for me. The problem is is that I'm ALWAYS thinking about these things. I'm worried about money, buying property, raising my future child, etc.

-I have a very hard time saying 'no.'

-I feel I always need to do something during 'nothing time' to keep myself distracted from over-thinking.
