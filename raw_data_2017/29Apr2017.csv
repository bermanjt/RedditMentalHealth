0,"I'm only 15, and I have crushes. But lately I've liked this guy and ever since I became conscious of him, I feel like I'm mentally ill or something.

1) I start to have this weird panic attacks. Everytime I try to think something about him, like a love article on the internet, or all that might go wrong with our relationship. I get this breathing problem where I feel like I can't breath. I keep gasping for air but it feels like nothing goes to my lungs. It seems like I can breathe but it feels like I can't. It's so much like drowning in air. If that's even possible. Although after a few seconds, I'm able to force myself to breathe calmly. But it happens more often now, that I'm starting to get scared. :( it all happened when I started to like him. No matter how hard I tried to breathe, no air would fill my lung's hunger.

2) I just feel so done with life. At the first few days, I felt energized, I felt like I was on top of the world. But because of him, with his effect like coffee, I couldn't sleep! I started to lose sleep. I started to get irritated. I became so tired everyday, yet at the same time, just seeing him energized me. After a few days I felt so stressed. So tired. So done. It felt like my head was going to burst. I felt like crying, but no tears would come out. It was really bad that I had to lock myself up and I couldn't even sleep. No matter how hard and long I tried. Thoughts kept racing in my mind endlessly, even though I was so tired of thinking. It was as if my soul was more alive than ever, yet my body couldn't keep up.

3) Just thinking of him makes me feel like fainting. Literally. Just thinking of him I feel dizzy. I feel weak. My vision goes blurry which leads to number 1, those panic attacks that never fails to make me feel like crap.

4) I can't get him out of my head. And when I do think about him, my head starts to ache. Everything in this complicated world reminds me of him. Sometimes it hurts but at the same time it makes me feel happy. It's as if even though I have no chance with him, just loving him from far away makes me fullfilled and blissful. I can no longer focus on school word because of it.

I have no idea why this is happening to me. Please help. I'm really starting to feel like I'm becoming insane.",29Apr2017,2

Studies show that the caffeine in coffee can boost metabolism by 3-11%, and increase fat burning by up to 10-29%.

10,"I didn't really know where to put this story but i'll put it here, I initially put it on another reddit but I figured this would be a better place for it.

This is when I started 6th form,  I was 16 and I went to a school where I knew no one.
I struggled as everyone else there was already from that school, eventually finding myself in the geeky group. However, I never quite managed to be a proper part of the group, which caused me quite a lot of grief also the one party I was invited to my drink got spiked and I vomited on some girls cream carpet (prompting them to never invite me out again).

We were allowed out at lunch time, which prompted me to find the cheapest lunch I could which was greggs sausage rolls and 2 bottles of Pepsi max (they were a pound for two), this was my lunch for pretty much the whole year that lead me to an addiction of Pepsi max for around 2 years before I shook it. I failed 2 of my 4 subjects that year and left to go somewhere else, too embarrassed to repeat a year (not that I wanted to spend time there anymore).

Just before I went to this sixth form my mum married a man who we'll call McShit, a short man of normal stature who had dark hair that was slowly receding. He was a little odd at first, but nothing to bother me, he moved in with us and started work on his house so we could move there.  McShit's 'friend' who we'll call McDodgyBuilder was one of two people working on the house, I helped out a few times but it seemed to take forever for the thing to get done and I suspect Mcdodgybuilder was prolonging the building time as McShit was paying him a lot of money weekly. 

Also just before I went to said sixth form in the summer my sister at age 17 announces she's pregnant,  this proved to be incredibly stressful as she and her then boyfriend with his cousin moved in to our small house for about a month. It didn't work as he was a drug dealer and a bit of a nutjob, whilst being abusive to my sister.

We moved into McShit's place at around the November of when I was at the said Sixth Form, this is when he changed. He turned into this snarling dog of a man, he was angry all the time, he shouted at the smallest of things, treated me, my mum and my sister like shit. I found out later that he physically abused my mum at some point. 

One time was at Christmas where my sister was heavily pregnant, and we had my nan and grandad round, my grandfather who suffered from parkinsons and alzheimers (who still occasionally had moments of sublime clarity) was obviously quite a mess to look after but he is not integral here. my nan, had inadvertently switched a switch off in the garage which turned out to be for the heating instead of the light. MCSHIT was wondering why it was so cold,  (angry about that) he then found out the cause and went absolutely awol, i've never seen a man so angry, a red mist fell over his face as he turned rabid, he was just screaming. Anyhoo a couple of days later my sister's water broke, and my nan and grandad were ill with flu, this caused my sister to panic. My mother asked MCSHIT if he could take her parents to their home in Norfolk, to which he said no as he was going to the pub. The situation turned to be okay and I now have a nephew who is 4 and really quite the brat (I say this lovingly).

We moved out of his house just before my exams were to start in early May, which was stressful. I flunked my exams as you know and la la la.

That summer I don't think I left my house more than 4 times, I hid and played video games.

After summer was over I headed towards a different sixth form college closer to me where I rekindled friendships with people from my original school, I even had a really sweet girlfriend. It was going great until my sister was stabbed and raped by one of her ex boyfriends (not the dad), we'd uncover to find out he'd been abusing her since he started her in the summer. She nearly lost her child to social services, and she was fine from the stab as it was a pretty dull knife. He was still on the run and constantly phoning my family sending threats so we had armed police outside our house for a week until we had a police alarm put in our house that was activated by a button. My dog of 18 years died around this time, followed by my grandfather (rest in peace and God bless both of you), my mother left to see my grandfather the day he was on his bed and leaving this life whilst my sister's ex boyfriend was still on the run and sending threats, my mum wanted me to stay at her boyfriends house to which I declines as I wanted to kill this ex if he dare approached my house. 

Everything kind of worked itself out a bit after that, we are still incredibly poor but i'm at university now and doing okay. I suffer from a few chronic conditions of which I blame on the stress and Pepsi max, but i'll live.

If anyone wants to know more, please say there's a lot more to it but this is just a brief story of it

tldr: my mum married an abusive basket case, my sister got raped, my dog died and my grandfather died in a fairly short amount of time.

11,"I want to get some things off my chest. But I don't know who to talk to.
For a long time, I thought I could ignore my problems. But I realized some things in the past few days. Nothing will solve itself. 
I don't know how to explain, or where to start.
I keep moving my head around, cracking my neck. 
I also roll my eyes a lot. You could call it tics.
But they are not involuntary, not really. I get this urge inside me, like feeling nervous. Then I get this feeling in my neck, something doesn't feel right. When I crack it or stretch it feels better, at least for a minute.
I can suppress it, but that only makes the feeling worse. I HAVE to move or crack or stretch my neck or roll my eyes or bite my cheek or just move some part of my body to reduce this pressure inside me. It get's worse when I'm stressed.
I wanted to fight it for a long time. It's just that I'm somehow afraid to talk about it. Talking to people makes me nervous. Hell, when my phone rings my heart starts racing. I always have this feeling people laugh at me behind my back. That everyone thinks I'm this weirdo who can't sit still for ten seconds. 
My girlfriend left me. Not just because of my tics. More because I did nothing against them. Even though I promised her I would get help, I did not get help. Multiple times. All I did was blame myself for everything. Instead of getting my life together, I would lie in the bed, crying. Thinking about what I did wrong, blaming myself, drowning in self-pity. I just can't stop thinking. If I had the guts to get help a few months ago, would we still be together? Is it my fault we split up, or was she not the right one.
Her leaving me made me realize I need help. But where do I start?

15,"I have been getting help for depression, anxiety and OCD for the last 22 years. The really bad times come in waves, or cycles, that have been increasingly well spaced as I have gotten a handle on things over the years. Unfortunately, they do still happen.
Recently, I have been going through a particularly bad spell so we (my Psychiatrist and I) tweaked my meds a little. We went up on my bupropion, up on my fluoxetine, switched out my Risperdal for Abilify and added some PRN Loraz for the panic attacks.
My question is about how to remain creative during these times. I create children's illustrations, sew and play guitar... usually. The more my doses increase, the harder I find it to do anything of use. It is a balance I am always trying to get... enough meds to keep me going but not so many that my creativity and productivity are driven out.

So, I guess I am wondering if anybody either has tips on how to deal with it, or even just activities that they find manageable when they are medicated up?

We got along so so so well, and we used to talk everyday ect and then text eachover in the morning!

We organised a date for a sunday and everything was fine, until the saturday before. 
We was talking and then i didnt get a reply? I didnt get a message back until 2 days after, she told me she has family problems, and that she dosent really feel like talking to anyone. 

I thought i would leave her a few days and see how things go, the only problem is, she didnt text me once, and when i text her i would not get a reply. I asked if she just didnt want to talk to me and the answer was she still had family problems. 

A week went by and i text her again saying that if its me she should just tell me and i wouldnt text her again. This is where she told me someone has died. 

I felt so bad an apologised ect and i got the 'Okay its fine ect' 

Today i asked her if shes feeling okay ect and again no reply, i dont know wether i am the problem or she actually needs room? 

IMO if someone died id love to spend time with her and i think that would help me? But for her it seems like i cant help her and she dosent want to talk to me?

20,"I saw this post on r/tumblr of someone self diagnosing themselves with all sorts of illnesses. 

After the anger subsided. It made me wonder. Honestly, why do people selfdx? Is it a trend? I notice people tend to self diagnose with certain illnesses more often then others (anxiety, autism(?)) how do they come up with the diagnosis in the first place? 

Those who do self diagnose- how has it helped you? Why haven't you sought a psychiatric or psychological assessment? How do you seek treatment without official diagnoses? 

Edit: although lots of down voting, I really appreciate everyone that posted some really interesting and valid things. Mental health awareness and access to services seem to be a big issue all over the world, whether health care is paid, free, whether your in a developed or developing nation.

23,"Hello there, kind of a dark subject but something I have been brooding on for years and finally thought I would at least put it out in some way even if just to be able to grasp the issue myself.


I was just watching this video about less well known doctors working for the Nazis during WW2 (NSWF) [Link](https://youtu.be/ACLYthqs-ZU?t=15s) during which it shows an emaciated teen with a nurse behind.. when this image came up I realized I felt nothing regarding it, no shock, anguish or horror at the image of this unfortunate person.


My father got me hooked on WW2 documentaries and history/politics as a subject in general when I was no more then 5 or 6 years old, I am 23 now and over the past few years with growing self awareness have began to ponder on some questions about myself.


Much like desensitization from video games and movies with people today I have to ask myself is it simply the number of times over the years I have seen images/clips of the holocaust and other mass executions and starvation's that has caused this? it feels almost like a socio/psychopathic response.. while of course I understand the personal and political impacts and ramifications of the event it really is starting to ring true of Stalin's quote ""the death of one man is a tragedy, the death of a million is a statistic'


I am of half German(Mother)/Ukrainian(Father) descent born in Canada and my father always gave me a very German-centric view of the war.. never to do with Nazis but in regards to their military, due to him being born in the Soviet Union I suppose and hating Russia before leaving in the 70s, my great-great grandfather also serving with the SS Viking and later Müncheberg after being left for dead by the Soviets who had conscripted him also probably had some influence.


The Holocaust was just a subject we glossed over time and again, as far as I know my family had no personal involvement but still perhaps a subject he wanted to leave for later or let school teach, still for years I saw many glimpses of humanities depravities in these documentaries or read in books. 


So years on I sit here asking myself did all this history, something I so loved and devoured at every opportunity just help eat away at me from the inside, it runs over into other areas as well such as modern day tragedies and I can almost see myself from the outside not reacting as quickly or emotionally as I think would be the norm or wondering if its some subconscious response.. I have also dealt with clinical depression on/off over the years and while currently in a generally better state then most of my life I wonder if this sense of detachment or coldness to the subject could be affected by that.

Tl;Dr My father helped get me into military history at a very early age and now years later I am starting to take a look at myself and wonder how it affected my development and mental health, growing desensitization over the years feeling cold and detached upon seeing images that would disturb or horrify others.

25,"A 19 year old friend of mine suffers from a special type of migraines for 10 years now, (called “Deformed migraine” by her latest neurologist, couldn’t find any results on google for the term) which causes shorter but more frequent attacks instead of the usual long but rare ones. (about 2 hours per attack, 5 times a week, one longer attack here and there). Last medication she used was Relpax (eletriptan) which she had to quit because of sudden nose bleeding. Her most recent neurologist prescribed Cymbalta (duloxetine) which is an antidepressant that is said to help migraines too. The doctor was initially going to prescribe an epilepsy medicine, but said the patient was “too young” and should take Cymbalta instead. 

The problem is, she doesn’t want to take an antidepressant fearing that it might mess up her mental health and “zombify” her, so to speak. There are also many people who experienced severe withdrawal effects and we can’t decide if a commitment like this would be worth it. 

What is your opinion on taking Cymbalta just to fight migraine? Do you have any stories from people around you who tried them? Are we unnecessarily exaggerating and fearing antidepressants too much?

(Germany, Austria and Italy were the main locations we went) The first few days were awesome but midway through the trip idk what happened but my mind was changing or something. I was worried that I didn't feel right, like I just felt really different and didn't get the same vibes I usually felt. Then near the last few days I got worried and kept overthinking and hyperthinking, but the issue I was overthinking of was NOTHING. Or it was something, but that ""thing"" was the nothingness itself. 

Like I got over the different feeling thing, (that turned out to be nothing, but me overthinking I did) but then I was getting anxiety over just the fact that I was panicking (in my head, never a freak out or panic attack) of what happened before. I looked it up and found out it was most probably just homesickness. 

But now, it's been 5 days back, and I'm still having the same issues. (Just a bit more minor) I just keep trying to remind myself that I'm worrying and overthinking literally ""nothing"", but il still think about it. I try to just forget about it, and ignore it, but it seems like one of those things like ""once you think it, you can't unthink it, or once you realize it you can't unrealize it. It's weird af. 

Il usually forget about it for most of the day if I'm occupied and/or with people, but il keep coming back to this and have these ( very)minor mental crisis. Its one of these things like, if I were to just somehow forget about it, and never remember it or have to think about it, the problem would be completely solved and I would be normal. (Because he problem is keep thinking about it, and it being nothing) 

I figured this would probably go away by at least the end of the month or something like that, but I feel like I'm not mentally well now, and that's a bit scary for me. What really bothers me though is that my problem is quite literally, ""nothing"". But the problem exists because I'm keep thinking and going back to that ""nothing"", and can't Unrealize it. I'm naturally a bit of an overthinker at times and that's probably where my problem arises from. 

Im just worried that il never get over this and that il always be this way and be fucked up for life, even though ik I probably won't, but if I keep thinking this I feel like I might.

30,"Dissolving the Negative Ego
Posted on June 10, 2012 by Sen.
 
 

Here I am using “negative ego” as a term, I am not using “negative” as an adjective to define ego. The ego is basically the “I” reference in our physicality, and inherently it’s essential for our physical existence to have a structure, meaning and perspective.

The problem is basically with the negativity that creeps into the ego structure owing to garnering negative perception. With time, the ego structure keeps growing in the strength of its negativity to the point where it acquires a very powerful standing in your being. It becomes an “entity” that has a voice of its own, it’s like a negative person living inside you.


 
It’s very normal to take this “negative ego” to be who we are, and this becomes very dangerous because now we start protecting this structure in us – we become attached to it.

We fear its dissolution, we defend it, repair it, attract people who can keep fueling it and basically keep away from anyone who might cause it to be brought down (have you noticed a part of you that just hates this whole “alignment” process and basically wants to defend its right to be negative).

Dissolving the negative ego is one of the most challenging experiences one goes through during the process of alignment, it’s much more challenging that the release of “past” negative energy accumulation in our body/being. The reason it’s challenging is because we take ourselves to be the negative ego and so its dissolution feels like our own dissolution, or a psychological suicide – it’s literally a death of a certain personality in us, a certain identity that we took to be who we are.

And the fact is that only after the dissolution of a large part of the negative ego do we start glimpsing that it’s not who we are – there is a lot of joy in this realization, but the process of allowing the dissolution of this negative ego, till this point, is a work of understanding. Without proper understanding it’s really easy to hold onto to this negative ego, and keep defending it as who you are. It’s tricky business because the “negative ego” becomes such a strong identity in your brain that it starts protecting it as a necessary part of survival, and anything that’s threatening its dissolution is taken to be the enemy.

It’s so easy to see this in people (especially the intellectual ones), how they come up with some really clever arguments to defend the presence of the negative ego, for most others the argument always is that “it’s too damn tough to let go of it”.

What drives the negative ego?

The part in you that always finds a way to be unhappy is the negative ego, period. The negative ego can’t be happy for long even though it does promise you that it will be happy if only it has “——-” (fill in the blanks). Actually, the negative ego clings to the desire produced in the moment, and uses it as a means to feel even more unhappy by stating that “I don’t have this, and I won’t be happy until I have this”. So the desire by itself is not the problem, the problem is that the negative ego clings to it and makes it into a new reason for being unhappy – in fact, it also starts feeling negative about the desire, it starts doubting the desire and uses it as a means to proclaim unworthiness delving into throes of self-pity, blame, resentment, anxiety and anger. I am sure this is a good enough description for you to see this entity in you – it’s so evident and its behavior is the same in all the minds.

The negative ego is fueled by your identification, your attention, your interest, your belief and your servility towards it. Without your identification, it can’t sustain itself because it’s just a “thought force”. The deal is that you can’t change the negative ego into a positive one, you just need to dissolve it and the natural wholeness of your being comes to the front. The negative ego can put on a pretence of being positive for a while, but anyone who has an iota of awareness can see through this charade – you can sense the fear behind the show of positivity. Since the very structure of the negative ego is based on lack and fear, it can’t ever be positive, not for long. The only way towards freedom is to dissolve its force in you to the point where it’s influence becomes “zero”. This process will take time, and it can feel like a real war in your mind for a while, and it can be tiring – however the more understanding/awareness you have, the faster you allow the dissolution to be.

There can be a few surprises where you feel really certain that you are done with the negative ego only to be struck with a new episode of its “emergence” triggered by some events or some thought – you can feel flabbergasted by its intensity, and wonder if you will ever be free of it. But the deal is that when it really done, it’s really done – until then it will keep emerging. At some point you will be stable enough to not be shaken up by its emergence and you can deal with it quite easily – when you reach this point you feel a sense of “power” within you, and it’s what I call a place of inner stability. When you lack an inner stability, when the negative ego is in the foreground, you “become” it – it’s just like being possessed, and this causes you to start believing that this is who you are, thus creating a cycle of identification and reinforcement. People who have some awareness can always see the “real you” (or the possibility of you) below the surface of the negative ego, this is because we always carry the vibration of our “higher self” (or ideal self) within us which is evident to anyone who is sensitive to it – when you sit alone with yourself you can also sense this ideal self within you, like your inner being that just feels submerged in the layers of the negative ego.

Identifying the negative ego

The most important requirement to start dissolving the negative ego is for you to identify it in your mind. As long as you take yourself to be the negative ego it’s not easy to dissolve it, because you will constantly keep defending it, protecting it, repairing it and pampering it. What feels like your “ideal self” is actually your true self, there is no two ways about it, and this is the self that comes to the foreground when the negative ego dissolves. So any part of you that does not feel congruent with your sense of your ideal self is part of the negative ego. It takes some brutal honestly to really start seeing the negative ego for what it is.

Another characteristic of the negative ego, that you can identify it by is that it’s never driven purely by love mostly because it’s rooted in “lack” and love is a loss of lackful-ness. Under the influence of the negative ego, everything is made into a means to an end, a possession, a way of self-enhancement, an achievement, a means of approval/acceptance, a means of entertainment, a means of security etc, and it’s not long before it brings this tendency even to the purest forms of love. Love, in its true form, is the only feeling which goes beyond the survival mode and it’s the most liberating feeling because when you are in love there is no “negative ego” involved – it just feels like the real you. It’s just that, it’s not long before the negative ego creeps in and basically corrupts this love in some way owing to its sense of lack. It need not even be love for a person, it could be love for a body of work, for a vision, for a desire etc, the purity of it is destroyed when it’s infiltrated by the negative ego and it becomes more or less artificial, losing its sense of depth. A work done from love has a depth that can never be achieved by a work done as a means to an end. When you love someone for who they are without the need for possession it has a completely different depth to it. The negative ego will convince you that it’s impractical to live a life driven by love, and when you buy into this argument you basically sign up for a life of drudgery and deadness that just starts eating into you with time no matter how hard you try to cover it up with distractions.

Actually, the negative ego is really easy to identify, it’s just that in many of us it’s in such a force that we are totally taken up in it; we never consider stepping back and observing it for what it is. It’s a heavy baggage on your being to contend with the constant resistance of the negative ego. The momentum of the negative ego causes you to fear it and you would rather give in to it rather than dis-identify from it – it’s like giving in to a bully out of the fear of being beaten up, it’s really no different. A lot of us claim that we are bullied by our mind, and it’s very true considering the fact that the negative ego is like “another person” within us, just that this person runs on the fuel of fear. Your true self, or your inner being, runs on love, that’s all that drives it and it doesn’t need love, it is love and it is self-sustaining. The negative ego constantly “needs” love, approval, security and compassion from the outside, and it’s always on a blame game routine.

We are so taken up by the negative ego in our society that it’s almost considered “stupid” to have an integrity or an innocent honesty – being manipulative, shrewd, calculating and cold are considered worthwhile traits to imbue, it’s called “learning the ways of the world”, it doesn’t speak much about such a world. This is one reason why people perceive it as being dangerous to be “innocent”, because the sense is that the world is filled with people ready to exploit your innocence – this obviously causes us to become even more closed, creating a strong fortress of negative ego. The only problem is that a negative ego can only attract more negative egos in your reality, there is no getting around it. We desire a reality filled with people of integrity and innocence, but we are unwilling to have the courage to first be that ourselves (you can’t attract what you are not being) – if not outside, atleast within you align with honoring your innocence, stop trying to be so “cold” and calculative. When you see innocence, and honesty, in others honor it, instead of trying to exploit it to your benefit or putting it down – a lack based, and cynical, mindset is the hallmark of a negative ego.

Disintegrating the negative ego

Poison for the negative ego is when you are no longer identified with it – it takes time, and it’s a war in its own right, a war between your inner being and your negative ego. Just that the way of the inner being is the way of a peaceful warrior – it wins by “allowing” fully. The mind feels like a battlefield for a while when you start disengaging from the negative ego – emotional blackmails, stark threats, projected doom are the ways in which the negative ego will try to pull back your identification, it will want to survive at all costs and the only way it can survive is by pulling your identification. Of course, the moment you become aware of the negative ego is basically its death knoll, this awareness ensures that you will see it for what it is even if you become pulled in it by it – with time you will be able to see through most of its gimmicks to the point where you are no longer taken in by it. Awareness comes from understanding and honest observation, and it’s the only force that can free you of the grip of negative ego. An important understanding is to realize that the dissolution of the negative ego does not happen through “fighting it” but by allowing it fearlessly without identification – if you fight it by trying to suppress it or hating on it, it just fuels it indirectly.

When you allow the momentum of the negative ego, in you, to dissolve (through the state of allowing), you will start seeing glimpses of your inner being come to the forefront. Initially they are just temporary glimpses and it leaves you with a sense that may be it’s not you, that it’s just some “experience” of goodness, but with time you will sense this inner being becoming you (it was always you to start with) in this physical expression, with no “gap” – it no longer feels like there are two of you, you just feel unified and whole. This is an end of conflicted behavior and resistance, allowing a harmonious expression to follow. Once you start getting a glimpse of your inner being coming to the forefront, the negative ego can feel even more suffocating, and it’s a good thing, because it allows you to let go of it more easily. You must understand that it’s pure “physics” that this force built over years will take time to ebb away, however, the advantage is that without your identification it burns away in short time (an approximation would be that it would take 4-6 months to sense inner stability and after that some more months to see a total dissolution) since it’s not supported by your life-stream as it were. Of course, if you keep identifying with the negative ego, it just takes more time to dissolve it – so it’s also a question of attitude.

It’s not an easy journey but it’s a journey that you can’t avoid for long because there is bound to come a point where the negative ego hits the threshold of imbalance, creating suffering which directly triggers the need for growth. When I say it’s not an easy journey I just mean that it can be physically fatiguing to deal with this intense play of energy (the negative ego has a strong force) within you, to go through a period of feeling a bit “dysfunctional” because you are in a limbo between the negative ego and the inner being, to see several parts of your external reality (that were fueled by the negative ego) dissolving, to deal with the fear of uncertainty created by being in this limbo. Frankly, this journey is one of the best adventures you can ever be on, it’s something you wish you could avoid when you are going through it but something you know you didn’t want to miss when you are done with it. It leaves you a different person.

31,"Hi, 

I'm a 22 year old guy  who feels lost and hopeless. The statement that ""there's light at the end of the tunnel"" I would reply,  what tunnel?
I know I'm only 22 but oh my god it has been rough. I'm so frustrated, annoyed, I don't even know where to begin. I read a lot of rescue kitten stories and I've just told myself that if a kitten can be rescued surely I can.

I'm stuck doing a degree at a fucked up university in a fucked up country, so I guess it's no shocker that i'm going through what I'm going through. But god I don't see a way out of it, really I don't, nor am I sure if I want or should get out of it.
I feel humiliated, embarassed, undignified. 
The things that sI used to like I'm not sure about, everythig in life I'm not sure about. Constantly confused. Anxiety and panic have been very good friends of mine, including feelig as if you're going to die, like you can't breathe anymore while you're sleeping, then you wake up as a result of that. 
The talk of energy and power is absolutely useless at this point, rarely do I have a ""bright"" moment. 
Most of my humiliation and embarrassment come as a result of me trying to ""go outside"" or ""having friends"" or anything that a normal person would do. 
I just want to ask, did someone go through and made it? Cause I've searched many times, tried counselling and anti-depressants and they didn't work.
I really don't know what to do.",29Apr2017,2
