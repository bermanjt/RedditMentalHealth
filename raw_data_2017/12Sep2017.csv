1,"Keep in mind I have no idea of any nomenclatures, but i'll try my best to describe things. 

My father in law has never been an OK person.  Overall childish behaviour, no perception of action and consequences,  cared only for his opinion and his preferences. He's never done anything to intentionally harm anyone, but ended up doing so anyway. Lost money, got debts, got in fights, crashed the car multiple times, drunk driving with the excuse he's sad so he can, angrly destroying other people's objects around the house because he was mad and needed to steam off, getting fired over and over again because he'd get in fights with his superiors (he's over 50 now and has never worked more than 2 years in a single job because of that), etc, etc. This led to a very unhappy marriage.... for his wife (and she actually has depression, but she treats it). For him, everything was perfect. Pointing him any problems was only dismissed with things like ""it was only once"" or ""I never did that"".

They've ""divorced"" once, with no papers involved, and got back together because my partner was still only 8. Now, that my partner is older, has a job, and we've been dating for years and plan to move together, they've divorced again, for good. And everything went downhill.

My mother in law moved to another state, knowing he'd try and go to harass her if she was nearby. She left everything behind, didn't split any goods. He's now living in the house with my fianc√©. The only thing sold was the car to pay some debts.

He was in denial about the divorce even after signing the papers - they would get in a discussion, he'd say something like ""if you dont like me why dont you ask for a divorce"", and she would have to tell him multiple times ""we are already divorced I'm moving out in a week"". 
Now that she left, he denies she did because she was unhappy with their marriage. Every day he tries to come out with a different excuse - his favorites are blaming her mother, saying that she never liked him and convinced her to divorce, or accusing her wife of cheating on him while saying ""I was totally faithful except on that one time but it was only one time or two"".

His condition is getting worse. Randomly screaming at night, random vomiting, random tachycardia, getting extremly needy and literally clingy (hugging or touching and not releasing - calling my fiance during work all the time - asking to walk my fiance to work so they can spend some time together, then never getting ready - making up problems when my fiance is leaving for work so he has to stay a little longer), not sleeping, claminig jesus sat in the kitchen's chair and had a chat with him 3 in the morning, randomly disappearing without telling anyone where he went, and forgetting things that just happened.

He's unenployed, but sometimes run some errands for a friend and gets some pocket change. Not enough to pay the bills, my fiance and I are paying everything for both of them, a dog and a cat. Goodbye any money we were saving for ourselves.

My fiance has already been called out on work for his constant tardyness and I worry for his job.

My father in law refuses to seek help because ""i'm not sick, only sick people go to doctors"". After the jesus episode we tried to convince him to maybe go to a church or support group but no luck. He doesnt read either, nor watches anything in tv that doesnt involve cars exploding or Muppets, so we cant indirectly give him any sort of help material.

Talking to him hasnt helped either. A few hours later he will forget certain things or even everything.

His latest odd behaviour was to start selling things. He's selling all his old miniatures, then clothes, then the extra couch and a washing machine, and now he wants to sell the house give us the money and ""dont worry about me i'll live under a bridge or something"". Of course that's not an option, as much as we want to live together.

We don't know how to deal with it and we need help before it gets worse.
It's been 3 months since the divorce.

throwaway account for anonimity.

edit: he also constantly threatens of self harm like saying he wont eat anymore, that he wants to drive the car into a wall, or that ""it's better if I just die"", but has not done/tried anything yet.

TL:DR - My fiance's parents divorced, leaving him living with his father alone. His father is visibly mentally unstable and refuses to seek help, and it's already affecting everyone. We don't know how to deal with it and we need help before it gets worse.",12Sep2017,1
2,"This term is a bit new to me, as I only ever associated it with self-obsessed, ""selfie-crazy"" people (the latter is not me at all). But now, as far as I can tell, it means much more than that. It got me thinking... 


I feel like I may be particularly narcissistic in my relationship with my SO. There has been a lot of stress in our relationship. When I look back, I resent him for some things he has done/said to me. Anyone I tell this to would say this is a huge red flag, but he has told me I am 'fucked' more than a few times. He would say it's the only way of ""getting through to me"". Maybe it was warranted. Maybe he was beyond frustrated by my narcissisim. Part of me, deep down, chalked it up to emotional abuse. Maybe I never addressed my issues and simply played the 'victim' card every chance I got. In fact, that is exactly what I've done. I've even managed to sort of alienate common friends/family in pretending he is the only 'bad guy' in this relationship. 


In general, I am a happy-go-lucky gal. I like my job, I've always been a very hard worker, I have friends and hobbies. I feel pretty normal in many regards. Maybe even above average in some aspects of my life, especially in terms of musical talents, general knowledge, level of interest in a great deal of enriching activities that are not particularly mainstream. Though I have friends, there are few whom I feel SUPER similar to. Can you see my narcissism coming out, now? Maybe I do think of myself as a ... what does Reddit call it... a special sort of snowflake? Maybe? How can I admit that without feeling like I'm totally insulting myself? 


There's other stuff too... I tend to be sort of careless/reckless/indifferent about things I should REALLY not be indifferent about. In some situations maybe I'm just being defiant with my SO. Not giving up just for the sake of not being wrong. He has told me many times that I just ""never agree with him."" He has accused me of loving to fight, of picking fights incessantly.

A few examples..... 

- Lack of empathy for his health condition - I've asked him when he thinks he'll be able to come to a halt with all his lifestyle changes for said condition (honestly because they inconvenienced *me* - like him, I have to sleep at a 30 degree angle, and other things...) 

- About 4 years ago (not that long ago!), we were living together and he had a rotten tooth. He bled heavily, which should have made it a significant event in my memory. HOWEVER, I have little recollection of this event. Yes, I was there. I was busy in my own little world, with my schooling, etc. I wasn't a very nurturing girlfriend. I don't really remember it at all. 

- I've been careless when I was nursing my son. The milk would come really fast and he would choke. This is really terrible, I realize. My SO would tell me to give him a break, that it was too fast, to wait til it subsided a bit, and I'd just never listen. I would downplay it. The next time I'd keep the breast in his mouth during a let down. Probably 60% of the time, he didn't choke. For some STUPID reason, I kept trying it. My husband would get VERY angry about this. Understandably. And I would take it personally, of course. I was supposed to be the mother who knew these things. I didn't want to back down and admit I had been doing something wrong. Ugh... I'm an idiot.

- I seem to downplay a lot of things. I want things to be ""fine"". My husband's the opposite. There's a random thought that came to me recently in light of Hurricane Irma. Had we booked a trip to the Caribbean for this period of time and KNOWN about the impending hurricane before leaving, my reaction would be to go anyway. Particularly if they were non-refundable tickets. If food in the fridge is ""too old"" for my SO, you can be sure it won't be for me. I see this sort of thing in my mother, A LOT. Though she may be far worse than me. So maybe that explains it. I do some of these things automatically. Without thinking.

I don't WANT to be this way. I want to be empathetic, and know what to say and how to say it. Sometimes I force myself to say the ""right thing"" but there's no feeling inside me, really. It's like I can't really ""get it"". 


I did something horrible again involving my husband's health condition. Downplaying his symptoms and not being transparent about something I fed him that I bloody well knew he was trying to avoid. His post on Reddit went sort of viral. It got featured on a friggin' PODCAST. People's comments were really eye-opening. And his post was not even biased. He told the story honestly and I got so much hate. I probably felt at my worst reading the 250+ comments he received, when I should have felt the MOST terrible for what I did to my SO. Please help. We are seeing a counsellor at the moment but I feel it's taking a really long time to get at the crux of our (my) issues. 

Thanks.

TL;DR: I feel like I may be a narcissist. I hate being wrong, and will act in ways that are just plain stupid just so I don't have to back down from my stance. I have a hard time being empathetic. SO has gotten angry with me over this a lot over the years. At times, I may prioritize my needs over everyone else's. I hate this about myself. What can I do? ",12Sep2017,6
3,"Being rebellious (bad relationship with father during childhood).  Prefer to do things in your own way, not your boss's way. 

Want to control your time, instead of being constraint by the company's schedule. 

Easily upset when you find you are not totally controlled by yourself, but by others, especially by people who sometimes are ignorant. 

Feel very sorry for yourself if your boss is younger than you.  Consider it a disaster of your ego. ",12Sep2017,1

6,"Hello everyone. A few details about myself:

I'm 21, trans, have no insurance and live in Houston, TX. I have been struggling a lot with depression, anxiety, and especially with suicidal thoughts. For the past month, I don't go a day without thinking about suicide, whether it's actually thinking about how I'll go through with it or just knowing that I don't have long before it happens eventually.

I reached out to my best friend, who suggested I speak to my mom. So, tonight, I did. I told her my feelings and thoughts and she suggested a voluntary commitment to Ben Taub, which is our local Psych Hospital, I think. She's very supportive, but I'm scared to do it.

What is it like in a psych hospital? What should I bring if I decide to go. What are the pros and cons? And if anyone can share their experiences of being committed? Also, is it just 3 days or is it longer?

Thank you. Anything and everything is helpful. Thank you.",12Sep2017,6
7,"Not sure how long to make this. This is the first time I'm reaching out. I could go on for hours. We had a very rocky relationship after she left my father. She has (primarily) emotionally and psychologically abused me since I was 11. She got very jealous of my dad's new relationship and alienated me from him and my step family. She has always lived vicariously through me. Tried to sleep with one of the first real love interests I ever had. Told me I'd basically amount to nothing because I dreamed big as a young adult (wanted to be a horse trainer. Well here I am, training horses for a living)
She married a drunk who she abused and then claimed he abused her. Multiple restraining orders, then back together with him, etc. Lost her mind when she found out I talked to his sister and accused me of hanging out with him. 

In 2014, she was diagnosed with cancer. She told me via texts. I had blocked her on Facebook at the time because she was getting increasingly abusive, lying about me, and I needed to have some space for my own sanity. One text read ""well now I'm going to die and that's what you've always wanted so you can have your wish and shut up. Bitch."" There were more. I'm feeling physically ill just writing this but hopefully you get my drift. 

Over the past few years I have tried to make things ok between us, only to have her push me away as soon as I feel like we are getting somewhere. I even asked if she'd like to go to counseling. She refused. But the sad thing is I can't be around her for more than about 8 hours a week or she starts with the abuse again. It's killing me because I want things to be ok between us before she dies but it's sucking the life out of me to try to make things peaceful. I'm exhausted, sad, and anxious, but afraid if I talk to anyone I know, she will find out and disown me forever. There's more to this, but I don't think I can stomach putting it into words right now. I need advice. Thanks in advance. ",12Sep2017,2

9,"Hello everyone, I haven't posted much on reddit so I hope I'm not breaking guidelines. This is going to be a long write and honestly, I'm very grateful if someone reads all of this. 

To introduce myself, I am a 16-year-old in college. My parents are divorced and I have no siblings. I am an introvert and I have social anxiety. I have 3 friends in my life. I consider them all my best and only friends. Both of them moved very far away and are also busy with school and their jobs so it's very hard for me to talk to them. My mom fought stage 3 thyroid cancer ever since I was very young until 2013 where she got into remission.  In 2012, my parents divorced after years of constant fighting. I became aware of their fighting when I was 9 when I woke up 3 in the morning due to their fighting. Ever since then I have been fighting with depression since I am an introvert who was consistently bullied all throughout high school. I was hated by most people and I was consistently told by people in my class to ""just go kill yourself,"" ""no one likes you, so it would be better if you were just dead."" I have been struggling with the thought of suicide ever since I was 13. I have switched to many different schools, eventually, I would hear the same relentless words from my classmates and peers. I have attempted suicide twice, both times were unsuccessful when I was 13. I cut my wrists as a way to cope with my feelings. I have been through multiple psychologists and I would feel better for the time being, but after a few days, I would immediately feel like shit. I am constantly alone, but I have a fear of being rejected by people and staying alone. My mother knows about my depression, and she's tried to help before. I have consistent dreams about me killing myself, some feeling lucid. But I would always wake up to the horror that is reality. 

Fast forward to now, my mom has regained her thyroid cancer and now it has spread to her lungs. She fears that she won't be able to make tomorrow as she's consistently in the hospital. She's having a paid leave as she's in the hospital almost 24/7. I am struggling with my classes as I can't focus anymore. I'm dorming at my university but I feel alone even when I'm at a campus full of people. I can't decide my major and what I want to do with my life and it's all stressing me out. I'm scared of being alone and I have my thoughts tormenting me day and night. I'm emotionally unstable and I don't know what to do anymore. I have to find a way to pay my tuition and I can't get any student loans since I'm a minor. I also owe my father money since I spent a lot on my debit card. I can't love myself anymore, I stopped taking care of myself and I haven't slept or ate in the past few days. I would usually eat one meal a day and that's it. I'm trying to find a job to pay my dad and my school. I resorted to cutting my hair (I had very long hair) and selling it for $100. I can't afford anything and I have held on to that $100 for the longest time. I have told all my best friends about my current situation and it's not like how it used to be. I can't see them on a daily basis like how I used to and it really hurts. I hate being alone as an underaged kid in college with no family and no direction in life. As the school year has just started, I have no idea if I have the focus and motivation to be in my classes. I really want to be in college and hopefully, go to medical school or become an animator.

I have constant suicidal thoughts that torment my mind and dreams almost every day and I can't seem to stop it. I've noticed that it has taken a significant toll on my attitude and relationships. I have become a very pessimistic and negative person that repulses everyone that I speak or interact with. I complain that I can't make any new friends or interact with people but I can't stop my negativity. If it wasn't for my supportive 3 best friends I have no idea where I would be right now. But most importantly, I'm terrified that I'm starting to get a personality that is like a sociopath. 

I have a full prescription of Minocycline 100 MG pills that is intended for my acne, but I just want to swallow it whole and end it all. I've tried twice before and failed. Hopefully, third time is the charm. I'm scared. I want to die but I also don't want to die. I'm confused and helpless. I don't know how to help myself or how to practice self-care anymore. I want to give up. 

I need somebody. Anybody.

24,"Hi! I am a grad student who needs mental health help, however I am afraid of being honest in my counseling intake session because I don't want to be pulled from my program. Is that possible? I am a high school teacher candidate and I worry that because the program is so strict that I will be deemed unfit to teach or something?

Normally I am completely in-control and okay! I think rationally and I am mindful in my actions. However, I have been diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression, and I have been treated for it in the past. I was in conversation with my counselor who was really touchy about diagnosing me with BPD but had me take a BPD test and placed me in CBT for awhile. I live in the US and can no longer afford my former counseling help/no longer have the insurance for it. I was actually in that CBT group until I lost my health insurance.

So, I haven't had any kind of professional mental health help in a year and a half now. I have been struggling. After a really rough recent incident where I punched myself in the face so badly that I had bruising on my face I realized it is time I seek help. I used to self-harm with cutting when I was younger, and in my 20s began having this seldom but scary-violent episodes of punching myself in the face. I don't know why it happens or what it means, but I know I need help.

... I just don't know how honest I should be in the intake survey at my university. If I answer yes to self-harm will I be kicked out of the program? But if I avoid that question or say that I don't self-harm or think about it or however that question is worded, I am concerned I won't receive the help I need.",12Sep2017,2
25,"Hey there. My sister is an 18 year old female. She has standard anxiety symptoms such as shortness of breath and overall paranoia, but there's more to it.


She feels as though she will swallow her tongue and strains herself for full days to keep her tongue in her mouth.


She also is afraid of touching her tongue to the roof of her mouth. I believe she said she fears for it touching her brain from it. She strains herself to keep her tongue at the bottom of her mouth for long periods of time. She can sometimes be panicked from talking or eating as a result.


She has other little problems all involving her face and head area. While we're told it's most likely just a chemical imbalance she's afraid of the possibilty of these issues coming from a brain tumor. (Again probably just the paranoia)


We'd appreciate any tips anyone might have for her dealing with these issues. This has been more and more of a problem as of late.


We have been seeing doctors about it and after trying a couple things they sum it up to a chemical imbalance and possibly a complete overreaction.


I can't say it's not an overreaction as I wouldn't know. Just last night she was telling me about how she wishes she knew someone who had the same issues or knew what could help her feel better.


I'm not expecting that miracle answer that helps me in all ways. I'm just throwing this out here in hopes someone possibly knows a thing or two on the matter.

26,"Hi, I am not an English speaker so sorry for the grammar/spelling mistakes.


Before I begin, I would like to say that mental illness in my family is a huge taboo, we don't talk about it and we usually look down on people having mental illnesses (we as a family, not me personally. I don't care about that stuff). 


Anyway, I go to university and last semester I went through a **really hard time**, because of the exams and the fact that I was alone 24/7. When I finally went back home during the summer, I was really stressed out and sad cause I did really poorly and my grades went downhill. But I was also happy cause finally I would've spent some time with my family and stop staying by myself all day long. 


I told my eldest sister that I might be depressed cause I've been sad through the whole month. **Ah, the biggest mistake I've ever done in my life, I'm incredibly stupid**. I think she told that to my mother and things started getting worse for me, like the fact that I was already sad and stressed out was not enough.


They started isolating me like I've never experienced before: once I eardropped a coversation where my eldest sister told my mother  ""*I don't want to stay alone with her, I am scared*"". And I was incredibly shocked cause I am not aggressive and I also don't talk much or insult people, I am on my laptop 24/7 watching movies. 


Then, my mother told me that I shouldn't bring knives and forks back to my room in the dormitory, cause they are too difficult to wash (like whaaaaat?!?). Nonsense, does she think that I might kill myself or others? Jesus, I said that I feel depressed, not that I am or I have suicidal thoughts (which I don't). 


My younger sister does not talk to me when we are alone in the house, she just pretends listening to music and I don't talk to her cause I don't want to freak her out. I am sure that it's my mother fault cause when she left home in the morning, she told to my younger sister ""*Don't do anything, just stay in your room and listen to some music*"". 


I thought that I would feel better when I went home, but I feel ever worse. Luckily, I will go back to my dorm next week, but I feel betrayed. I thought that family was the most important thing on earth, but I was wrong. Now I understand when an old friend told me: **you care too much about your family, just wait... you'll see how they just care about themselves**. 


What would you do in my place?

I want to specify that I have no weird behaviour: I do eat, shower and sleep regularly. But I don't go outside cause I live in a city that it's boring as hell. And they think that I'm out of my mind because of that. ",12Sep2017,3

28,"I have searched around and only found a couple of old posts regarding this, it has been called 'passive death wish' i believe.

I wouldn't say i was at all depressed but life really means nothing to me, i am 37, i have good friends, good family, an ok job which i don't totally hate, i smoke a shitload of weed every day but these days thats the only ""drug"" i do, i rarely drink alcohol anymore and am a pretty nice, balanced guy.

The only thing that gives me even a little bit of joy is attending metal and punk gigs but at 37 a lot of my friends are married and have kids so can't always attend the shows especially the mid-week ones, i am divorced and living on my own and honestly really happy on my own,i have my own space and don't need to answer to anyone.

Now the reason for this post is my lack of enthusiasm for life, the only thing in the world i feel love for is my dog,if i didn't have the dog i would look to find a way to escape from life early.

I wouldn't want to commit suicide because of the people i would leave behind, i couldn't do that to my family even though i honestly have no real love for any of them, they are nice enough boring people, yes i love my mother because she is my mother but i know i have no real love for her, just obilgatory son love.

Once my dog dies, he only has a few years left in him i think i can't see any reason for carrying on but i have to do it in a way that is an accident or something.

Like i said i have no reason for this thinking but have been like this since a teenager, no traumatic events, no abusive childhood, just pure emptyness.

I envy people who enjoy life, i am just happy for it be over and done with at any time and i hope there is nothing afterwards.

Anyone feeling the same way?

39,"So, I have and always have had severe anxiety around being sick or hurt. Now that I am pregnant, this anxiety is really bad. I don't believe I am a hypochondriac because I only have this anxiety when I'm actually hurt (if I'm not in pain, bleeding, or vomiting I'm perfectly normal and have no anxiety what so ever). For example, if I accidentally cut my finger with a knife, even if it's not severe, the blood and pain will make me really anxious and I'll have an anxiety attack. I would get really anxious and nauseous when I got my periods. Not because I thought that there was something wrong with me, but because of the pain and blood. I'm now pregnant with my first child and I'm really struggling. I have Hyperemesis Gravidarum which gives me severe nausea and vomiting all day every day. The vomiting makes me anxious. Again, I don't think I have a life threatening condition or anything like that, I just don't like bodily fluids and pain. When the doctor drew my blood at an appointment I got anxious, light headed and threw up. Today I had another appointment and the doctor gave me a Pap smear. She said my cervix was bleeding lightly since she scrapped it which she said was normal and not to worry. I quickly got anxious, light headed, and threw up. This anxiety is really making me hate being pregnant and I have so much fear around giving birth and the bodily fluids involved. Should I talk to a therapist? What do you think is the problem?

41,"I've googled dream addiction but I can never come up with anything that describes what I'm dealing with. I found out about maladaptive daydreaming but it's more than that. 

I have always been fascinated by my own dreams and find them very enjoyable. I love the ones where I can fly, breath under water and explore amazing worlds my mind creates. I have some old dream journals from back when I actually had time to write. I would wake up and think about what I saw and did, write it down and then start my day. But lately I find myself running back to my dream world every chance I get. Before I got my job I would sleep for 12 or 15 hours straight and my boyfriend would have to nudge me until I got up and take a shower.

It's gotten a lot worse only now I don't have the time to sleep all day because I have a job. My body has gotten into the habit of waking up naturally at 8 am but every time I do I will lay super still and be as quiet as possible so that my boyfriend doesn't wake up and make me get up for work. I try my hardest to return to my dream or enter a new one if I didn't like it. I always regret it when my mornings become rushed, I feel miserable and don't have time to eat. I always swear I'm gonna actually get up when I wake up and get stuff done but I do it again. In my groggy state I don't think clearly. My desire to dream again is so strong.

Every night before bed I listen to fantasy themed asmr videos like fairy role plays, water nymph role plays. I get really into it. It relaxes me and give me nice dreams. But unfortunately the nicer they are the harder it is for me to break out of it the next morning.

 I also have imaginary friends that I have conversations with out of bordom or to work through a problem I have in real life. If I'm alone in a room I'll whisper and imagine him/her walking around the room and that they're talking back to me. There's one I have who is an other worldly being who helps me travel outside of my body and into other worlds. I really should say that I do know the difference between reality and my fantasies. 

I'm really interested in learning how to lucid dream to give me more control over the visuals, my characters and the sensations. But I'm afraid it will only fuel my problem... How do you break an addiction to something like this? I can't turn off my ability to dream. This isn't something like alcohol or cigarettes that I can just throw away.",12Sep2017,5
42,"Here's the problem:

I fulfill all the criteria for both Avoidant Personality Disorder and Paranoid Personality Disorder, according to every internet resource I've found, and the descriptions on Wikipedia fit me to a t. Mental health America's screens also say that I have a high likelihood of some form of depression and anxiety.

*However,*

I find that most of the people I know seem to think I'm being attention-seeking or self-victimizing. They might be right, and I don't want to seem like such a person. I'm also personally worried that the criteria are particularly broad, and that such things are actually pretty much normal and just don't get diagnosed because most consider them such. Also, Wikipedia is Wikipedia.

What do you guys think?",12Sep2017,1
43,"Please help. I constantly sing/play music in my head. They're not hallucinations I don't actually hear the music as if they're playing but it's like when you have a song stuck inside your head. Anything can trigger it, like if I read a musicians name a song by them will come on. I don't think this is normal. It never bothered me and I never thought it was weird or abnormal until about yesterday. I was trying to stop myself from daydreaming and sang a song inside my head to stop it. Then I thought about how I wasn't paying attention to class and then suddenly I started worrying about the constant singing in my head. I've tried to stop it, but no matter how hard I try I can't. I do have severe ocd and mental rituals are one of if not the biggest part. Is this because I'm just hyper aware now that I'm worried? Whenever  I don't have a song in my head (which only happens for a couple seconds) I'm suddenly aware I don't and it starts again. But I do know this has happened a lot while I walk class to class etc . Is always thinking about musi and singing the lyrics in your head normal? Is it OCD related at all and how can I treat this please I can't live with this any longer I already have too many suicidal thoughts

45,"Her condition has steadily gotten worse, and today she finally allowed me to take her for scheduling an appointment. But first they need blood work, urine sample, etc. I am afraid they will admit her, and she is afraid as well. But she really needs this help. She has been hearing voices telling her to hurt herself, and hallucinating. Her father is schizophrenic, and she has bi-polar on her mother's side. She experiences both symptoms to some degree, but we will see what happens. 

Keep her in your thoughts, this is going to be a long process. 

Edit: leaving her with the doctors was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I'm going to visit her tonight to see how she is adjusting. 

EDIT 2: She has a UTI, which made her symptoms much worse. This is good news as once it's cleared up, and she's diagnosed and medicated, she should be able to go home. We are praying it's only 3-5 days. But it may be several months if she fights. Luckily she isn't fighting. ",12Sep2017,61
46,A therapist who wasn't a doctor told me that you can take a mood stabilizer for OCD if you have racing thoughts and can't sleep.  Is this true if you don't have all of the symptoms of bipolar?,12Sep2017,1

50,"Hi, I am me, from Finland.
Well, the title may be kinda misleading. I do not sincerely be like ""aha, this is the rule"" - so it shouldn't be really considered making them but my head sure loves to keep things around. Remember when you said 7 years ago that you wouldn't stand a moment of watching me self-harm? I remember. I remember it super clearly, probably the tone of your voice and the exact words. It stuck with me. And suddenly, 7 years later I find myself crying uncontrollably in your arms because I get this fear that IF I'd get some crash or episode or lost control and would harm myself even just a little bit you would walk out of my life. And couple days later I discuss this with you and you get worried I can't take it if you show any weakness or worry or sadness that's generated by my condition. And then I understand. You don't remember that moment. You don't make rules. I make rules. And I correct you that the ""you can't take all of this I'm too much"" -moment I was having was because of that old fear that if I would succumb deeper into this sickness you wouldn't help me up - you would leave.

And I'm starting to recognise all these rules I've been making - how I constantly try to 'correct' my errors, being, something because someone told me in a meaningful moment that it is a wrong thing to do. Like how I ""shouldn't write my feelings into an internet diary where a community can read them"" because young old me never talked about her feelings, only wrote them up and closed a window after that. Or like I should try to preserve presents to a great extent only 'cause my sister decided to shame me when I was teen and had gifted my gift from my parents to someone dear that could do more with it. 

But it is damn exhausting. How to distinguish these rules from the basics? Like the things are living with me. Inside of me. I move and they move with me. My head is building up small explosions on these rules but I don't know how many are there and how will I manage? My therapist said that I should remind myself that the bad time will not last long. But what if it does. How can anyone be sure?",12Sep2017,2
51,"I'm not asking for an internet diagnosis.. but I'm kind of at a loss, besides just standing back letting her be on her own journey. 
I'd like to understand it better.. if anyone else has ever thought things like this?

She's been saying this stuff off and on for about a year. 
 We've been separated a few times during that time to give her space to find herself.

She has repeatedly said things like
 ""I don't feel like a whole person""
""I'm not happy with life in general""
"" l feel like I'm just treading water""
""I guess I just need to find a hobby to occupy every hour of every day""
""I'm fucked in the head, so if you want someone that isn't you'll to look elsewhere""

And frequent comments about life being mundane.

I've tried on a few occasions to gently suggest therapy but she is not receptive to the suggestion. She just says stuff like ""you're not the first person to say that""
And ""ohhhh great /s"" when I mention that maybe it could benefit her having an outside opinion and someone to talk through things with.   I've asked her once or twice if she thinks she's depressed and she said no. 
Is there anything a spouse can do to help? ",12Sep2017,2

53,"I just saw the movie ""It"" and SPOILERS AHEAD........ all I can think about is the one scene in the beginning when Georgie gets his arm bit off and then dragged into the sewer by the clown. It has literally made me depressed. It is the only thing I am able to think about. I keep telling myself that it is only a movie and that it's not real but it isn't helping me. All I can think about is how little and helpless he was, how pure he was. How he didn't deserve all that pain, all he wanted to do was play with his boat. I tend to overthink things, as this has happened before after I watch TV shows and movies. I get legitimately depressed for days or even weeks from this shit. Another thing too is the way he was with his older brother. How close they were and how he yelled his name when he got dragged down the sewer. My little brother is autistic and non-verbal, so I feel like that attributes to why I'm so depressed. I feel like I wish that I had that relationship, but I never will in my life. And every time I think about how I'll never have that it hurts. But that isn't the reason why I'm depressed, because like I said I've gotten depressed from films before. I tend to overthink and daydream a lot, sometimes I feel like I don't even live my own life, that I live my whole life in my head, fantasizing about the way things could be. Literally all I do all day is daydream about my life, making it different. I wish I could just flip a switch and turn my brain down but I can't. Do I have an actual problem?",12Sep2017,1
