1,"(I don't have any psychiatrists or anything of sorts near me, my parents don't believe in mental illness, and I don't have any friends who can help. I'm just a 14-year-old who can't really do anything)

english isn't my mother tongue.

I have never been raped or molested in my life. I think I am being constantly abused by my mother, I'm like a black sheep to her, mainly because I have different opinions from what I'm taught, and my interests aren't that common where I live. (example, I like philosophy and psychology, lots of people do have a wrong idea about them and I'm always berated whenever I talk about such stuff. also, I am bisexual so my mother labels me as abnormal and keeps on lecturing me about how I am a disgrace and stuff like that) 
About 2 years ago, I've come to loath myself and became depressed. my personality, interests, body figure and gender, I hated everything. it wasn't really a big deal though, I lived through it normally. A couple of months ago, I got bullied and became suicidal. I was so close to committing suicide but was scared and didn't do so. Things got weird after that.

1. I started doubting myself a lot, someone would say, ""you look dead"" and it took time to convince myself I'm not dead. I'd be debating a topic and even though the other person would say illogical incoherent stuff, it would get to me and I would doubt myself and believe the other person, even though I'm sure they're wrong. So say if a random passerby called me an idiot, even though I know he doesn't really mean it, I would struggle to not believe him. I also have a problem processing metaphors, I know they're just comparisons, but then I doubt my intuition and take them literally.

2. If I read a fictional story, I feel stuck in it,, I dunno it's like I'm trapped where the story takes place and can't get out, I don't see or hear  anything abnormal, but my mind gets disconnected from reality, I believe I'm in the story. 

3. I started getting afraid of any color other than black. Each color invokes certain feelings in me. I also get really frustrated if there's a color that doesn't go well with others. This hasn't happened before.

4. I feel intoxicated at random times (I've never consumed alcohol); I'd be overthinking and suddenly I'd stop, my mind would feel hazy, I'd think about extremely bizzare stuff (trying to kill myself for fun, or try to turn myself into a vampire, for example) and start laughing or vigorously bite my nails.

5. Whenever I get triggered, I would get severely depressed and then reach a point where I start feeling happy all of a sudden, this feeling then stays for 2 or 3 days.

6. I sometimes suddenly forget who and where I am or forget some memories of my life.

7. I overthink a lot, I can't control it or make it stop. (I don't hear voices though)

Can anyone tell me what this might be? Is it a mental illness or am I just overreacting? and what should I do?

Thanks.

2,"I was asked at work to take on a new project. One I'm very interested and invested in. However this has also resulted in me trying to get 3 months work of competed in less than 1, while one of my young clients is going into crisis multiple times weekly. I start crying when I get to my desk, and I feel like a failure that I can't help her, and that I can't forsee getting everything done before I transition out. I worry for the next clinician who is taking over, and not having everything in place for my caseload (13 kids) to be supported. I'm completely overwhelmed and each day , each crisis brings more work that I'm struggling to complete. 

I don't know how to schedule time to write and complete all of the clinical documentation, and to provide support to my team during these times of frequent and extended crises.

I've been in this field for almost 10 years - but I've never felt so helpless and sad.",11Nov2017,1
3,"Up until recently I've been attending peer support weekly--mostly generic ""recovery"" types that can apply to both addiction and mental health. I feel like attending has really helped me a lot and it's something I want to continue to do, but some recent health issues make it difficult for me to physically attend.

So I'm considering an online alternative, but it's a little overwhelming. I was hoping someone here here might have experience with online peer support that they're willing to share, or recommendations for where to start.",11Nov2017,1
4,"Whenever I become overwhelmed by emotion, it's usually because of fights with my mom, I pretty much lose all control and common sense and do weird things. These things include bite myself, pee in the sink, rub spit all over myself, put dirt in my mouth, run around screaming, and throwing myself onto the ground after jumping off something. I used to also hurt my cat during this state (kick him, whip him, and throw him onto his head), but i dont anymore. Im 15 years old and have never been diagnosed with a mental disorder.

5,"I'm seeing a counselor at my local county mental health place. It's the second counselor I'm seeing because the last one referred me to a DNP who (upon research) turned out to be advocating the use of healing crystals and things of that nature.

The counselor seems like a nice enough person but she has one of those diffusing lamps on her desk and suggested ionization therapy and potentially EMDR (both of which I wasn't able to research until after we met for the first time).

How widespread is this? I was diagnosed with severe depression and it seems the only treatment options being lobbed my way are on par with homeopathy.

Thanks for your time.

6,"I'm seventeen years-old as of July. I am female. WARNING: I have a lot to write.
I suspect that I am suffering from some sort of childhood trauma. Since as long as I can remember, my parents yelled and argued with each other. I witnessed a lot of their fights as a child. Specifically, I clearly remember my mom hitting my dad in the head with a can opener before he pushed her to the ground on her butt and made her cry. My mom then ran upstairs. My sister followed her (she's three years younger than me...and I had to be maybe 7 or 8). My dad's head was bleeding, and I followed him into the living room with a paper towel. I remember asking if he was OK, and he replied that he was fine... but he seemed broken inside. My auntie took my sister and I to the circus later... got us cotton candy and everything, probably trying to distract us from the prior events. I cried during the elephant act. 

I'm worried that this event is some form of childhood trauma for me. 

Anyway, I grew up to be very angry at home. I have frequent tantrums...I'm easily angered. My parents say I am disrespectful, that I back talk too much. I'm bossy and ""overbearing"" and nasty. I'm a spoiled brat. I am crazy. I convinced myself that I had Borderline Personality Disorder for a few weeks before last summer started. My therapist said I just struggle with emotional dysregulation instead. 
At school, I have friends, but I often feel isolated, like none of them really like me. I experience social anxiety. I am too sensitive. I worry about everything. I cry almost every day at the smallest of things. I feel like I have to force myself to socialize. Fcking depression. Sometimes, life feels pointless. I must admit, I think about suicide a lot. I'm lowkey still alive because my boyfriend is really good at making me feel needed on this earth. 

Last October, my mom smashed my phone into the ground (about a more personal matter). She basically broke me then. She smashed it twice for good measure. I fell to the ground, tried to fight her, screamed, yelled, cried, and ran to my closet with a bottle of pills. I put two in my mouth and spit them back out. Coward. 

I don't like life. I find myself always searching for peace. I light candles in my room and listen to ASMR and massage my scalp and Google ""how to be happy"" or ""traits of the happiest people""... but I'm still sad. What sucks is that I have to hide my suffering. My friends wouldn't understand, and I don't feel connected enough to my parents to open up. The only person I confide in is my boyfriend. Thank God for him! He is a lifesaver--literally. I trust him 100%...but it's unhealthy to rely on him and him only for emotional support. It's scary...

What was my original question? I just went on a tangent. I just want some advice. Please, I don't feel good. I feel weak, and I want a sense of community. It sucks to feel alone, and according to my past journal entries, I have been suffering to this extent for years. I want a better life, one where I don't cry myself to sleep most nights.

7,"So I had a really abusive single parent (I'm a regular on r/raisedbynarcissists ) that was distant and stopped hugging me at a young age. I cherished every second I could be near her until she became abusuve to the point where I couldn't stand to be close to her (she stopped giving me hugs at around 13 anyway). Now I have gone no-contact with her and haven't seen her 3 years (it's all for the better -- she tried to kill me and kick me out when I was 17, which led to me being homeless until just January of this year; I am now 20. I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression) and am in a relationship. My boyfriend has issues of his own and is not very affectionate. There are alot of things I'd like him to change about himself, but my therapist has pointed out that I spend too much time on him and other people and things I can't change. I realized that she's 100% correct and I've been working on myself for these last few weeks. She pointed out that I put the responsibility of my happiness on others, and that that's wrong. 



It was a really difficult concept for me to wrap my head around, having a narcissist for a mother who expected me to be the sole provider for her emotions, but she's right. The problem is that my SO does not like physical affection as much as I do. When I envision my ideal relationship, it's my significant other and I snuggled up and watching a movie, or snuggled up watching the stars at a campsite... Just the togetherness aspect is consistant. Since I pointed this out, he's made an effort, but I'm also thinking part of the issue is that I don't know how to handle NOT having physical contact now that I have a little more of it in my life. I get what I'm sure is unreasonably upset and begin to take it personally when my boyfriend doesn't want to be physical. The only difference now though is that I now recognize it's not his job to fix what someone else has done, but it just really upsets me still and I don't know what to do with these emotions. I don't kow how to deal with myself and many of the issues that SOMEONE ELSE gave me, but I have to. I just had a depressive episode earlier because of all this and I don't know what to do to make those feelings of needing that security to go away. It depresses me further that I need it (or feel I do). I have no other family and no friends that live in this state; Just my SO and my older cousin, who is often too busy to visit. How do I deal with the lack of re-inforcing touch/the feeling of helplessness and abandonment when I don't get it (even though it isn't personal that that person is doing it? ) ",11Nov2017,10

9,"Hey all. In 21/F and I've been self punishing myself since...well...as early as 10. I don't know or what kind of therapist to go to. That urge spikes in high stress, or just random bouts of what I guess has been depression. I punch myself in the head, typically until I see a white flash. The worst moment was smacking my head against the floor until I found an acceptable amount of times. I talk myself down, I hate everything about my existence in these moments. And it lingers, and. I don't know what to do. What kind of therapist helps with this? Where does this kind of behavior stem from?",11Nov2017,1

11,"The last two and a half years, I've been battling Misophonia/Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome (SSSS). 
I'm seeing a Psychiatrist, she gave me my pristiq prescription. Which has been helping the time that I've been taking such medication. I go through my day doing the best I can to get through sometimes overwhelming most head pounding headaches and migraines. One of the given strategies; Conditioning myself with listening to classical music and using memory to associate the sounds I dislike and feel sickly over with that music to overlap. Really the only other solution I have been using lately is, watching movies and (rarely) going to the cinemas to see movies (if anything we get a drink each)...
For a while now, I feel like, with doing all of these things would lead to something greater for not only my loved ones, to be able to spend time with them without feeling flight/fight. 

Please, let me know if anyone else on here or you know of anyone else who has this Neurological disorder and they're *just* dealing with this. 
Absolutely aware at current; 
- Living with my family, including my partner
- I am in my early 20's
- Already not eating at the table each night for dinner or just about any meal we have together (if my mind lets me, I use my strength to get through a special occasion)
- I have good headphones, but am looking at a set of ones I can travel with, Bose is my ideals, I believe I have some of those special earphone things on the way in the mail. From what I heard a while ago that is, to help tune some things out completely. That will at least guide with the audio side of things. 
- Visuals however, I have trouble with still. Keeping low level of eye contact with whatever is setting me off is all I can do to settle that. 
- I've been to the depths of this whole thing since late 2013, gradually pulling myself out by threads. 
- Wondering if I should up my medication, whether that'd make a difference (200 to maybe 250/even 300mg) I've heard this is rare to do for patients using desvenlafaxine, but if it will help my situation having this effect just about all that I have, I will go forward with it. 
- I am not going the path of medical Marijuana. No. 
- Am supposed to be travelling soon, already scared enough to keep my necessities with me. ",11Nov2017,3

14,"Hi I’m 23, a teacher in many ways I have my life together but recently I was on holiday I was sexually assaulted by the night manager of the hotel I was staying at. 

This wouldn’t be much of an issue because I was able to overpower him physically and defend myself by it seems to have triggered a remembering of sexual abuse past.  I have been sexually assaulted by people I care about by the part That affects me most is at  he age of 11-14 I was groomed and exploited by many men online. They destroyed my self worth and convinced me the only worth I ever could have was to make them cum. This involved sexual shows but also harming myself for them. I was so ashamed I never told anyone. 
Recently their banished voices have returned along with nightmares, night terrors and episodes of self loathing and desire to harm myself. I get flashbacks and am paranoid they will find me once more.

It’s exhausting and it’s really affecting my relationships, especially with my partner. 

I have had therapy in the past but because I struggled to get it on the NHS I could only afford a limited amount of private therapy. It helped me deal with previous abuse and neglect but the therapist was uninterested in talking about sexual abuse but now that is what has me wake up every night in sweats, heart beating fast, unable to return to sleep. I am so tired I don’t know what to do. 

Any advice?

Was I dating a sociopath? She has mental health issues anyway, Like She has DID, And Autism and probably other things, including Self harming. She always called me her lovely at the beginning and sweetness, as the months went on, that stuff disappeared. I did insult her sometimes and yell, but that was because of the way, She was being.

I used to be good at being nice to other people like my friends, but I wasn't always have chances to understand emotional things whenever people talk to each other.

Because maybe I have been reluctant to catch up the feelings of other guys and I've been thought everything based on only my viewpoint, not others' viewpoints.

But after puberty has gone and I became an adult, I still feel difficult to concentrate on 'sad feelings' of others. I usually try hard to make others laugh by quoting some non-sense words or phrases and making me totally stupid.

18,"How do I feel? Part 1
I hope everyone is cool for we to write up some weekly “how do I feel” articles. Looking to post about how I feel by each week reflecting on my life and how it may have influenced this. It’s something I have always wanted to do and something that was recommended to do so thought why the fuck not. This is straight from the heart and nothing edited (poor grammar might be the giveaway haha). A little rambling but I hope you all enjoy and please, I would love to see a discussion open up, suggestions or even speak out and talk about what’s going on with you in the comments section. I am looking to post on a few subs that may be relevant, in this case eating disorder related subs and Mental Health. I am using “a throwaway” for the moment as what I will discuss/talk about I am not yet ready to disclose who I am, which my real account would give me up pretty quickly.

How do I feel? A question I have avoided for many years with answers I have hidden deep within myself. Guilt, shame and disgust. Emotions I have felt from as far back as I can remember.  These stem from a multitude of different situations I had experienced from a young age that has certainly shaped my mental wellbeing, but I am not here to talk about them all… yet. This week I want to talk about eating.

Eating. I love eating, I love it so much that I lose all control, I become entranced by it. Disconnected from all reality, consumed by my lust for this one brief moment that passes my lips. The food controls me. I have no sense of when I am full, I continue till I begin to feel the shame, hate and pain, a feeling I find subjected too daily now. It is very strange to admit I give myself up to food, I allow it to control me, my urges and my thoughts. Constantly allowing myself to revert back to feelings, after the moment of euphoria, of guilt and shame. How do I allow this to happen? Why do I let it happen? It’s strange to describe it to myself in a way as some form of addiction. Just that one thought that plagues my minds for hours, like an addict in a ritualistic way setting up the situation to inject. Everything falls into play and then the moment. Waking up in the middle of the night, dazed and entranced, food calling my name. It fucking angers me as I type this, thinking about these moments and how I just lose control. How can I be so weak?

These are all signs, warning signs highlighting that something is not quite right. From the eating till I am sore (uncomfortable), eating alone to hide shame and embarrassment among others. All pointing to, something I hesitate to call it, an eating disorder, specifically Binge Eating Disorder. I hesitate not because I don’t believe it to be a true eating disorder but rather the struggle of admitting I have one. Denying the truth that it’s just cause im lazy and stupid. Through my life I have dealt with quite a lot, which I will discuss in other parts, which I no doubt believe shaped my eating habits. 

It was installed from a young age that eating should be emotionally charged. If I am sad I should eat, if I am happy then why not eat? Excited? Well then we should go the whole 9 takeaways. Every emotional state was the basis for the bad habits and where I see it all started. I always ask now as a 26 year old adult, why not just break the habit? It’s not as simple as that, and I know that very well. Now it has turned into something toxic resulting in frequent yo-yo dieting, use of anabolic steroids to assist these drastic weight loss methods, and when I stop the process of binging begins again. Like a egg timer going off, the weight loss being a countdown and the bell being that part in my brain saying “BINGE”.

Lately I have been asking the question, what do I need to do, to stop this? How can I manage these situations? Recover one might say. Talking has been the best way I have found so far. I go to counselling, not only for this, but it has really allowed me to explore how far the rabbit hole goes with my eating and emotions. I have also opened up to my girlfriend, being honest about it and allowing to work on the situations that arise together. We talk about when I get the urge, my constant thoughts and focus on binge eating. Another method I have implemented is abstinence. Sounds strange but like an addict I have found that even the smallest amounts of what I call trigger foods sends me off into a binge. No chocolate, gummy sweets, fruit (sounds strange but it can) cheddar cheese… the list honestly goes on. I can go months without a binge but as soon as I touch certain food, ice cream being the worst, it can send me back onto daily binges (like at the moment). Also trying to retrain myself, when situations arise that evoke emotions of guilt, shame and disgust or intense thought of food I focus on something, I force myself to exercise, read a book, do anything I can to refocus. Move my thoughts away. It is hard but I am working on it. 

My question to those who read this, how have you dealt with your eating issues? What have you implemented into your daily life to cope with issues relating to binge eating disorders? Also, where do you think or have found your BED stems from? I would love to hear people’s thoughts and points of views on the subject. ",11Nov2017,3

22,"Hello. I'm using a throwaway because many close people know of my main account and I don't want them to think I'm nuts.

First of all I really don't know if this is the right place to ask this, if it's not then I'm sorry. But to get on point:

I have a mental issue which is ruining my work life (and my life). I am a 20 year old male working as a professional folk dancer. I love my job and everything about it, I also love our country's History and I often read it when I have the time. But the issue I have is making me stop working and even stop doing the things I love.

It's hard to explain it but I'll try : I get too much into things, when someone mentions dancing, history or something I like I immediately start to sweat and my stomach and head start hurting, I get all strange and obsessive with the things that I like to the point of them hurting me. I get strangely uplifted when I work (during the performance everybody is calm, but I'm like a excited monkey). In my free time I watch dancing videos and read about History , I practically obsess with them and if someone mentions some inaccurate fact about them my body becomes tense and I immediately have to tell them they're wrong and tell them the truth. ( even if it's a person I don't know )

Again, I know it's strange asf and I tried to explain it the best I can, but it's slowly making me crazy and I might have to change jobs ( the thing is that I really don't want to do that since I love my job and hobby but it's hurting me )

Does any one know how to manage these kinds of symptoms? I would absolutely appreciate it if someone can give me an advice , what kind of illness I have?

Thanks in advance!",11Nov2017,1

27,"Just a thought I had about why I'm finding it so difficult to achieve a lasting sense of something calmer and more secure than what I've experienced for so long.

When I'm alone I can calm myself down and build myself up to a degree sometimes but as soon as I'm around people my fragility again becomes immediately apparent and I perceive attacks and disrespect everywhere. Obviously we teach other people how to treat us and so I give off some kind of vibe that invites this treatment, and so I should just try something different, which is what I've been attempting for years. Trying to change my body language, speak less instead of trying to fill the gaps with mindless chatter (because it's usually something self derogatory or too revealing), but I seem to be unable to consistently be mindful of the need for this change in the moment when it needs to happen.

Similar to the way in which it can be maddeningly difficult for a person with a short attention span to train their focus and keeps finding that no matter how hard they try their mind keeps wandering. It's like that for me with confidence and the way I feel, think, speak, and act around other people. I'm just like a big open wound getting pushed around by people and by life. 

Having boundaries in the moment, fast, as unexpected situations come up seems impossible for me, I guess since they are just ""pretend"" at this point so my reflex isn't to behave in a healthy way automatically. 

I'm so easily bruised and frightened by people and it's the WORST!!! I'm a 35 year old man who is beyond sick to death of being treated so poorly and of being so deeply affected by everything around me all the time. It's like I'm stuck on an annoying boat in a storm when I just want to go chill on the beach for a while.

You know those dreams where you can't control your limbs even though you *really, really* need to? Like a tiger is chasing you and the best you can do is sorta awkwardly and slowly move your limbs but they don't really respond in the predictable and effective way the usually do?

28,"I have a really bad habit of denial when it comes to any sort of health issues, physical or mental. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but I do not take my pills just because I don't believe I have it and refuse to acknowledge it, despite having a long line of family having depression and anxiety.

Recently though, my girlfriend has pointed out signs thast I have some sort of PTSD from my parents fighting.

They've been together for like 10 years now, since I was 8. They have fought every night for the past 6 years it seems, and they fought a lot before that. Sometimes I'd get no sleep because they'd yell at eachother all night, then I'd come home from school to them still yelling at eachother. I'd often feel like someone's life is endangered, and have attempted to run away when I was younger multiple times because I just wanted to sleep certain nights for school.

At first I thought it would never really effect me, i didn't care too much, but as I make this post I realize I just became desensitized from it all. 

My girlfriend has pointed out that when we fight I often just kind of fall apart and say sorry and go over the top when it comes fixing things even though when we both know I'm not in the wrong. I just hate the thought of dragging it out and being like my parents and I don't want to fight for hours on end. The thought of it makes me shake because I really don't want to be like that. I often hold up any issues I have with my S/Os and bottle up things that bother me or make me mad because I feel like I can't being myself to argue or fight.

I also have been having really bad auditory hallucinations or some shit, I will be at home in my room and I'll hear them yelling and breaking stuff. I'll then go up to check to see what is going on but everyone is asleep or sometimes not even home.

I don't know if it is PTSD from it all, and i feel like I shouldn't have it since all they've done is yell. I know theres other kids who've experienced worse from their parents and I feel like if I was diagnosed with PTSD itd devalue those who actually experienced worse.

I hope this also helps other people, because this call is factor in the reason why I haven't looked for help as well. 

Thanks guys. ",11Nov2017,1

I️ see things in porn like dildos and anal and all that good stuff and something about it arouses me. I️ don’t get the urge cause I️ think it’ll physically feel good (it doesn’t), it’s more like it feels good to see them do it and I️ want to emulate it on myself because seeing it is what’s arousing (confusing, I️ know). Is this unhealthy? It feels wrong/weird doing it and I️ don’t get anything out of it but I️ keep getting the urge from time to time (far and few between).",11Nov2017,5
31,"Okay, so I (F USA) normally am a normal amount of sexual with my partner. But recently I've felt so disgusted by it. Not by her, but by me. It's almost as if it's over stimulating for me. Like she'll try to touch me when I'm like watching or reading something and it'll make me freak out as if there's too much going on. And other times when she'll touch me, my body feels like it's in fight or flight mode where my whole body just feels alert as if it's saying ""danger danger"" and I don't understand. I love my girlfriend with all my heart and I wish that I could feel sexual but my body just won't let me. This has only recently started, is it ptsd from when I was sexually harassed by my uncle? Is it something about the time of the year? I don't understand. I have depression and anxiety too and I take meds for it, is that a possible factor? I just don't understand why my head is being like this. I get like super overwhelmed easily too, which didn't happen before. But now if there's like more than two things that I'm paying attention to/hearing/seeing it freaks me out and makes me want to scream. I don't understand what's going on. Do any of you?",11Nov2017,4

33,"I fell into depression when I was 10-13 and then it kinda went on until recently when I became 21, so I was depressed throughout the most formative years of one's life and when I was still growing to the full potential of my intellectual capabilities. I did relatively well in school but depression always pulled me down like an anchor and I was just trying not to drown even though I wanted to reach the sky desperately. Now that I'm an adult and my physical and mental development is mostly complete I should be able to reach my full mental potential without the handicap of depression. It feels absolutely enlightening, now that I'm healthy. My concentration disorders are gone and I'm a lot more receptive to complex information. Things that appeared to be intricate and confusing to me a few years ago now just come to me in an instant. I feel like I can take on everything I want and absorb knowledge like a sponge. My question is, is this change real or is it just me deluding myself? Is it the lift of depression or just the natural process of my brain developing (I think the prefrontal cortex isn't fully developed until about 25)? Is it maybe both?",11Nov2017,1
34,"Right now I'm sitting sobbing and making ugly noises in my room because I really don't know what to do with myself. For a long time I didn't want to admit it, but now I sort of have to. I know I need help and I have issues, but I'm in a position where I can't really afford it..hence why I'm here now. My issue is mainly with my family. Somehow I'm a normal and functioning human being outside (I have friends, and a community outside) but whenever I have a conversation with someone at home, it turns into a huge mess and always ends up with someone crying or screaming. I have really low self esteem and I want to believe in myself but it's really hard to when you don't know what the issue with yourself is. 

To elaborate on my issues, let me just preface by saying that I probably have depression or anxiety (things I never really wanted to admit) but that I can't be sure of because I haven't seen a professional.. I'm a lazy and brash person, also forgetful, which leads to a lot of arguments. I have a short temper, which makes it even worse, and also am really regretful afterwards and just sit there trying to breath. I just can't seem to make the right words get out during a conversation, and end up saying something really assholey and say stuff that I don't mean and make the other party get angrier. I just need some help on how to talk to people, maybe some tips on controlling yourself.

36,"Hi Reddit,

I’m here because I’ve reached the point where I don’t know where else to turn. I feel like my life is spiraling downward, and I don’t know how to make it stop. I’m a 21 year old woman. I work at a group home for children with mental illnesses and attend school, but lately all I can do is lie in bed and cry. I am very overwhelmed with my job and classes, both of which I hate. I’ve skipped more days than I’ve attended because I’m always lying in bed crying. I’m a senior and I could have graduated this year but I have no motivation to go to class or do well. I’m studying psychology but I can’t seem to make myself care about it. My plan is to become a psychologist and help people with eating disorders, but the way things are going I’m never going to graduate. I feel like a sellout because my true passions are poetry and philosophy but no one ever made a living off writing poetry. 

I have a dog, and she’s the cutest little monster I’ve ever met. When I say monster, I’m not exaggerating. Part of the reason I hate myself so much is because I’m a bad dog mom. Between work and school and lying in bed all day, I don’t have the time or energy to care for her the way she needs to be cared for. Every spare second I have, we’re going for walks, playing, training, going to the dog park, and it’s still not enough. I won’t go into all her behaviors, but I love her so much and it kills me to think she isn’t happy and it’s because of my failure as her caretaker. 

I think I have a lot of things like that and other small stressors that just build up and get me down. I start thinking about my past. I am a recovered anorexic. When I was in middle school I starved myself until I weighed 70lbs at 5’.  I know it could have been worse, but to this day it was absolutely the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life. I know I’m depressed now, but it was nothing compared to what I went through for those four years of my life until I somehow snapped out of it. I think a lot of my bad thoughts stem from that experience and now I can’t stop ruminating about it. I used to starve myself to the point where I would pass out during the day. I would shiver in 90 degree heat because my body couldn’t maintain its temperature. My hair fell out. I was a cross country star, and participated in soccer at the same time. During the summer, both sports had two-a-day practices and I would abuse my body with four intense workouts a day. On weekends I would run 13 miles a day because I was so anxious about gaining weight. Since then I have exactly doubled my weight at the same height. I know I stunted my growth from starving myself during puberty. Sometimes I get sad at how much taller I could have been because I have always always always been made fun of for being short. I’m 21 years old and I often get mistaken for my clients who are children. My body image is absolute shit as well. How could it not be? I doubled my weight in a year. I have stretch marks now and I’m overweight. I also developed bulimia as a result of my first eating disorder. I have tried treatment for it, but it is something I battle with to this day. I tried therapy, meds made my hair fall out, and I got so anxious that I lied to my dietician and led her to believe I was doing better than I really was. My parents watched me starve myself to death, then during a doctor’s appointment when he read “hx of an eating disorder” out loud my mom denied it ever happened. 

I have always felt incredibly isolated because of this. Eating disorders are taboo. They’re gross.  To most people, “anorexic” and “bulimic” are insults to mock skinny kids, not real, debilitating illnesses. I have never had anyone to relate to. I feel so alone every day even though I have a few friends because no one understands. Just yesterday, my boyfriend was visiting and we went to dinner and I panicked while we were ordering and decided not to eat. Then I spent half of dinner crying in the bathroom because I’m so messed up I can’t even order food in a restaurant. When I got back he was eating his food, I didn’t mention anything, and then we left. I tell him a lot about my problems but he always says they aren’t that bad and we’ll fix them and changes the subject. Sometimes I just want to talk about things and I feel like he dismisses and invalidates how horrible things are and it makes me feel even more alone. I love him and he’s a good boyfriend and I never want to leave him but sometimes I just feel so isolated. 

As anorexics are prone to do, I read a lot about anorexia and I discovered that a lot of times it’s influenced by over-controlling parents. My mom was beyond abusive and over-controlling. She was also sexist, and denied me privileges that my brother had just because I was a girl. When I was growing up I couldn’t even stand the sound of sirens driving by or dogs barking because from a distance it sounded like my mom shouting downstairs. I saw her try to stab my dad once. That part really gets to me sometimes, when I think about death and how I’m going to watch everyone I’ve ever loved die until I also die. It’s horrifying to watch your mom try to kill your dad as a child. Until I read about anorexia, I thought it was my fault I was fucked up. It’s even worse when my brain tries to blame my parents because I still love them. It’s hard for me to go home now, but I’m afraid I’ll regret not visiting them more while they’re alive. They seem decades older every time I go home, and my mom is not in good health. I’m terrified to watch them die but I can’t stand reliving the trauma from my childhood every time I visit and my heart is so conflicted about it all the time. 

I also ruminate a lot over my lost potential. I see all these people around me who grew up with stable childhoods and they’re succeeding in life where I could not. I think about how pretty I could be if I never had an eating disorder. I think about all the days, the heartache, the health problems that I would have saved. I wish I could just be normal, and succeed in school and relationships, and have a fucking meal in a restaurant without breaking down. I was so smart, so hardworking. Now I’m addicted to weed and cigarettes. I lie in bed every day and mourn this idea I have of “full-potential me” who is taller and healthy and can get out of bed to shower every day.
 
I can’t bear the idea of waking up to this life every for the next 40 years until I die. Sometimes when I’m lying in bed I imagine the ways in which I might kill myself. I picture myself getting in my car and driving it full speed into a wall.  The force of the impact scares me but then I imagine how good it would feel to rest. Even making coffee in the morning feels like it takes so much effort. I’m so exhausted with every little thing in my life, and I just feel like I need to rest. I have so much pressure inside my head, sometimes I picture myself releasing it and I feel all the clouds leave my brain. 

I don’t know if I could ever actually do it. I have my dog to take care of. I don’t have anyone in my life who could take care of her, and I don’t want her to end up in a pound so I know I’m her best shot. I love her so much. Even when dogs are little shits, they just want love and approval. I could never devastate her like that. She loves me too much. 

I’m sorry this got so long. I’m just so desperate for help. I don’t want this to be my life. What can I do?

37,"hi there, y'all. long post ahead. 

i'm a grad student with anxiety and depression making a thesis project exploring mental health and communication. i've talked to the mods of r/mentalhealth about posting here, and they've given me the go ahead, so here's where my mind's at, some info about the film i'm hoping to make, and some questions for anyone interested in participating!


---


As stated above, I'm an MFA grad student looking to speak with people living with depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses for a part of my nontraditional documentary thesis project. 

The thesis project itself is a visual anthology of short works about communication, interiority and mental landscapes, particularly as they relate to mental health. So far, the anthology includes several multimedia short works — from a photobook-diary hybrid about clinical and postpartum depression to a video game grappling with chronic illness to several short films focusing on depression within a family — that all relate back to the themes I've outlined above.

My reasons for posting here are twofold:

* First, I'm looking to hear more stories and to speak to new people — strangers and friends alike. The worst thing I can imagine happening with this project is that I create works that are all the same. That I don’t treat this topic with the nuance it deserves.

* Second, I’m hoping to look into communication itself — how we talk about mental health, and how we can talk about it. It’s a subject I grew up knowing to never talk about, despite the fact that nearly everyone in my family suffered from mental illness in one form or another. (My great grandmother received electro-shock therapy, for goodness sake.) The stigma feels deep and ingrained, and it causes harm. It’s part of why I believe we should talk about these things and share our experiences if we can. To follow up, and more specifically, elaborate on why I’m posting on Reddit — I’m hoping explore digital work. We don’t ever have to meet face-to-face in order to speak, to have a conversation, or to, say, make a movie together.

Talking about mental health is hard. It's work, and it can be draining. I know it’s a big ask on my part, so really no offense taken at all if you don't feel comfortable speaking! Just know you can comment or DM with questions at any time. 


---


I've included a lot of **sample questions** below. They're not exhaustive or necessarily indicative of the film, and you can definitely pick and choose which ones you want to respond to — or just ignore them and write whatever you want. These are just icebreakers or jumping off points that I'm asking in the hopes of provoking anecdotal stories. 

* Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (Age, Sex, Country of origin, etc. No personally identifiable information, please.)

* What mental illness do you identify as having, if any?

* Do you have an official diagnosis? Are you interested in persuing one if not? Why/why not?

* Do you remember the first time you consciously recognized or acknowledged it? (""It"" could be an anxiety attack, depressive episode, or something else entirely.)

* Do you remember the first conversation you had with another person who identified as having the same mental health situation as you? What did that feel like? What did you say?

* If you could write a letter to your yonger self, what would you focus on? Similarly, if you could write a letter to friends or family, what would you want them to know?

* When you experience a depressive episode, what does that experience feel like? Do you translate it into words, emotions, colors? Is it translated at all? Is it something you're able to recognize in the moment or only after the fact

* How do you talk about anxiety/depression/mental health, and how does that change based on who you're talking to? Is talking about it online different than talking about it in person?

* What was the last thing you wrote in your diary/journal/phone?

* What's the book /movie / video game / comic addressing mental health that's resonated with you the most? Why?

38,"I’ve been a loner for pretty much half of my life anyway. I’ve never really had any romantic relationships, I don’t really have any friends, and I don’t see any of this changing. Ever. Everyone is finding their significant others while I’m seemingly stuck in my life. I can’t live my life like this. I’m managing at the moment, but it’s only a matter of time before I will no longer be able to cope with the solitude. 

This sucks. The jealousy I feel towards people who aren’t alone and are happy is all too real. I despise that feeling, but I cannot deny its existence. Fuck you to that feeling and fuck you to everyone who is happy and are only rubbing it in my face(I don’t actually mean the latter one).",11Nov2017,1
39,"I'm frustrated because I've been happy for two days and been hoping things are getting better, then it happens. Seeing myself in the mirror, some irritation to my skin maybe from new products and I can't handle it. I sincerely want to give up and just die. It feels like nothing ever gets better, something always goes wrong and my instinct is to give up. (This example is today but this constantly happens to me)

It used to be helpful to research ways to kill myself, the cost, and where to shop online to achieve this, as a comfort for a way out but I stopped that now too (due to a promise I made to not do so). 

I'm just stuck. I'm recognizing this pattern, especially seeing it and recording it with my Daylio app this past week. What do I do now? How do I chill the fuck out? I just hate that things keep going wrong, I can't stop thinking about everything that's bad. I'm just irritable, sad, and non-functional. 

I see a therapist but it's too slow. We might work on something about anxiety for 45 minutes then it's over and have to wait 1-2 weeks to see her again. I have too much to talk about in therapy and there just isn't enough time anyway. 

She doesn't believe in diagnosing things either just treating and improving symptoms. So I don't even know what's wrong with me other than general anxiety and depression, I just feel deeply broken and don't want to exist. I do like my therapist though I just don't like not having a diagnosis, maybe if I did I could improve from all my free time at home 

I hate that I'm so strongly reactive to events. Sometimes good too, but the bad just weighs heavily",11Nov2017,12

41,"I’m not quite sure whether this is the right subreddit for this, please comment if there’s a better place for this.

When I was younger there was a period of time spanning years where I couldn’t talk to my family, and only my family. Growing up, my family had always said, nonchalantly and in passing, things to me that did lots of damage and I had developed depression. 

Now, I’m doing a lot better health-wise because of the friends I’ve met, so I’m trying to get some closure because until now, I have trouble speaking and putting my thoughts into words. They sometimes come out jumbled up and messy and while my close friends are used to it and can understand me, others don’t quite.

During that period, whenever I was prompted to talk I couldn’t do it, and communicated with head shakes/nods. It felt like there was something squeezing my throat and I remember feeling intense fear to the point of crying.

Looking back, I think it must’ve slowly developed from a fear of being ‘verbally abused’ (I’m not sure if I can call it that), so I ceased talking, which made it a lot worse unfortunately.

What I had experienced seems a lot like selective mutism to me, only based on the internet of course. While I’m not foolishly asking for a diagnosis online, I just want to hear your opinions on this. ",11Nov2017,7

43,"Is it possible to have a friend see a therapist against there will ?
He talks to himself constantly not the normal what if but full on conversations. They were not like this a few years ago and it gets worse. 

I told him it’s not normal and suggested he find somebody to talk to he said “ why I have myself to talk to when ever I need somebody” 

It has gotten to the point that I do not think I will allow him to come over anymore as they have just gone to far off the deep end and I don’t feel comfortable having them at my house. 

Any advice on how to help a friend ?",11Nov2017,1
44,"Example:
5 minutes ago, my niece who is 3 years old came to give me a hug and say ""goodnight"". I then imagine pushing her little body away, screaming at her, punching her and stuff like that. I turn around happy moments and make myself feel bad for something I would never do.

This has happened alot before. 

What the fuck is wrong with me???",11Nov2017,6
45,"So earlier I made a post about some insecurities I have been dealing with and I said I would see a therapist. I haven't been able to see a therapist yet (busy schedule), but I have been able to write down some thoughts that have been going through my head lately and I'm starting to think I have legitimate anxiety issues. 

And these ones are girl related (yay). I am a straight cis guy btw.

So a few things are going on:

There's this girl i kinda like. I hate liking girls because it shoots my paranoia through the roof. It sucks because it's not like I'm fucking devoted to this chick, I don't even know her last name. Every time. Every time I develop feelings for a girl I get this whole ""does she have a boyfriend, what if some guy swoops in and becomes part of her life, what if she totally likes me but I don't read the signs and don't know what I'm doing, what if she's getting some good dick on the side and I'm just a fucking melvin who wouldn't be worth her time"" 

ughh I fucking *hate* those feelings. LIke I know they're bad feelings and I'm not supposed to feel like that but it's just unavoidable and it gives me legit diarrhea.

Anyway, so there's this other girl (her friend, actually). And I am terrible at reading signs, worse at actually knowing *what to do* when I read those signs. So I don't really have a massive crush on this girl but she's definitely cute so whatever. Like honestly I'm not gonna be broken hearted if nothing happens but I also don't want to just idiotically let an opportunity for a relationship with a cute girl slip away or give off the vibes that I'm totally uninterested. Anyway, so I don't know if she likes me or if she sees me as a friend. Like I can't tell at all. We always talk and stuff before class and she always smiles when she sees me. She invited me to come study with her and we studied for like a few hours. We also joked and stuff and she would tell me all these stories about her family and stuff. I dunno. It was cool. But like, there's also this other guy, And I dunno if she just considers him a friend or if she just considers *me* a friend. No idea. But that's basically how it is for almost *every cute girl* that I become friends with. I never know if they're interested or not, and it *bothers the fuck out of me*. Especially because when my friends see me with a girl they try to give me advice and shit and it makes me feel like a fucking loser. Like thanks for reminding me that I'm inferior and don't know how girls work. That's an entirely different rant for another day. Anyway, basically when it comes to dating and relationships I feel like a kid who was picked up out of science class and thrown into a very complicated dodgeball game where everyone else seems to have a general idea of how the game works but I'm just sitting there like ""what the fuck is going on"".

I think the main theme here is *worrying*. I worry a lot, I lack confidence, I seem to have no idea what is going on and that *bothers* me. These are all thoughts I'm going to share with a therapist, but i wanted to see if you guys had any advice as well",11Nov2017,1
46,"Hi there! (This is my first post ever on Reddit so i hope i have the right subreddit and correct format.)

The last years i have been eating healthy, treating my body and soul right and i am living my purpose and doing what i love on a daily basis. Lots of times i get into these mental 'states' where everything just feels at ease it is in its correct place in the world. My whole body and mind radiates unconditional love, happiness and gratitude and I just want to share this with the world. (This happens without meditation or any other form of effort)
My question is: what is this state called? Am I having a spiritual / mental breakthrough? Am i just high on life?
I would love to hear from you, so I can find out more on this wonderful feeling.
Thank you so much, much love and happiness!

47,"To any people out there kind enough to help me, thank you - it means the world.

Over the past 6 months I have started to think things I never thought I would think and feel things that hurt me as much as physical pain and yet I cannot describe it. I don't go through one day where I don't think taking my life is not a good idea, and my own self-depreciation is starting to drive me insane to the point in which I become socially awkward, mute and unincluded.

I first tried talking to my friends about this about two weeks ago, and the first impression I got from them was that I was attention-seeking, and that sent me into a desolate spiral that I have still not escaped. One of my best friends (of two) has started acting extremely differently towards me and always seems to be in the mood to instigate an arguement or activley try and keep me unincluded from my small group whilst they do things and that is the biggest thing that makes me feel worthless. The only people I have chosen to talk to since then is the Samaritans. I just don't want to be judged for once - only questioned.

Now. The question part. If I no longer trust some of those who are closest to me to help me escape this dark state of mind, who do I talk to (other than the samartians)? Do I keep it to myself? I am starting to distance myself to the point in which I am on my own now and I really don't want this.

Including people in your group is the esscence to being friends with them. This uninclusion which I have felt has almost killed me,  has undoubtedly killed others and will undoubtedly kill others. 

Thank you for any advice. I'm new to reddit and am looking for a blunt, direct source of help.

50,"Hey all! So I've begun a journey with a new doctor to get me on the right treatment for my depression and anxiety. My conditions have proven quite resistant to treatment in the past. I thought I'd share the journal I've kept so far. Let's talk about this stuff!

Sunday October 29th- feeling pretty out of it today, yawning a lot, tired
Feels like my heart is beating a bit weird.

7:47 p.m.- experiencing a slight increase of anxiety and withdrawal from the present 

Monday October 30th- took 4 doxepin at night, slept in pretty late today (about 3:30) felt exhausted, but once I got up, I did feel like doing things. (Only time I've taken 4)

11:03 p.m.- weird feeling?? Not necessarily anxious, but somewhat bored/withdrawn feeling. 

1:20 a.m.- weird feeling- I think I've identified it. I had a horrible dream the previous night, and as I'm preparing to go to bed, it feels like I'm going back to that dream.

Tuesday, October 31st, 12:24 p.m.
Feeling okay, good mood, but sleepy and unmotivated.

2:51 p.m.- still in bed. Confused why the past couple days have been weird? Also getting the weird feeling that nothing is real and that everything around me is a simulation. Maybe it's because I don't have an emotional response to things I find familiar?

3:17 a.m.- Halloween ended up being fun. Was in my head earlier, but I went to the store, made a pie, made dinner, and had friends over to watch a movie. I was enjoying myself and more in the present. Currently a little stressed, because I have to clean 2 rooms tomorrow and make them ready for guests, and as a result of my procrastination, this will be no easy task. On another note, doxapin has kept me sleeping through the night. 

Wednesday November 1st, 3:04 p.m.-
I'm still in bed. I could definitely fall back asleep, it's like I'm addicted to the feeling of drifting off into it because sleep is usually much more difficult for me, and I don't have to think. I have a lot to do today that cannot be pushed aside, can't seem to get up though. 

Tuesday November 7th, 8:14 p.m.- noticing many visual disturbances tonight, kind of withdrawn and anxious. (Vibrations or visual snow in peripherals, little flashing specks, halos, after images, etc)

Wednesday November 8th, 2:37 a.m.- mulling over thoughts. Trying to figure out the strange feelings that sometimes overtake me. At times I feel like reality as I know it will shatter, leaving me behind with nothing but my consciousness, completely alone. This is one of my biggest fears, being completely and utterly alone, isolated with nothing but my thoughts. I think about this a lot. If everything is just a simulation. This thought sometimes makes it hard to be engaged in what's going on around me. Being so consumed with these ideas makes every day life seem pointless, like I cannot be in the present and enjoy it.

Also want to make note of two things- audio hallucinations while I fall asleep, and also some memory stuff. Dunno if its stress or what, but recently I was packing for a weekend in Detroit. I had friends down from up north, cleaning to do, and preparations for the event we were all attending. In the morning before we were about to leave, I'm missing two things needed for costumes. I looked everywhere for them. That night at the hotel, unpacking, I found the two items that were lost. I have absolutely no memory of packing them. As for the hallucinations, it sounds like music is being played from the distance while I'm drifting off.

Wednesday November 8th, 5:35 p.m.
Caught in the groggy cycle

6:29 p.m.- laying in bed. It feels relaxing to close my eyes. It seems I have to distract myself otherwise I fall into a hole of thinking. Sometimes it feels like my sanity is very fragile and could tip over with the slightest imbalance. I feel tempted to do something impulsive 

Self destructive? 

8:08 p.m.- kinda anxious. I feel like I can't look in one direction for too long, eyes doing weird things 

12:21 a.m.- weird, bored, withdrawn feeling- like I want to be done with this day 

Thursday November 9th, 3:40 p.m. Just got up. feel okay. I wanted to make note of something I noticed about myself. I
Go through phases of obsessing over one thing and thinking about it all the time. Last year, while I was dog sitting for my sister, I had a weird experience that convinced me a ghost was after me. For about 2 weeks I was so scared, I refused to go into her house, I didn't want to be alone, I sat in my car afraid to be in my OWN house. I experienced sleep paralysis twice during this time. Another example is my crooked tooth. It's been that way forever, but one day it just bothered me so much. All I could think was how ugly it looked, that my boyfriend was going to leave me, etc. I was so self conscious about it I would try to not smile, cover my mouth while laughing, and turn away while talking. Now I feel like I'm obsessing over these visual disturbances, this making it more noticeable and worse. 

5:26 p.m.- watching a show with my family. Slightly in my head, trying to identify things that make me feel ""weird"". 
I often have the thought that nothing is real. Everything is something I perceive, just me and my consciousness, and everything is controlled by a higher plane of existence. Very isolating feeling, kind of want to take a xanax. Feel like I need many distractions. Intrusive thoughts. The feeling that something bad is going to happen looms over me. 

6:17 p.m.- feel kind of awful to be honest. Like I'm in purgatory, trapped in a bad mood, not enjoying family time 

*kind of snap-mood changes. I don't know, I'm irritated with life. Fluttery feeling in my heart, kind of light headed. I just don't feel good. Indifferent, detached, bleh. I tried drawing, but couldn't focus. I almost want to listen to a song or watch a movie that will make my cry so I can feel some kind of emotion, instead of this limbo 

8:32 p.m.- felt the urge to drink, listening to music instead

11:18 p.m.- back down in mood. I don't know why this is happening. Trying to enjoy a show with my boyfriend, putting on a happy face, but I just want to go to bed.

12:04 a.m., emotionally defeated and exhausted. I don't even want to hang out with my boyfriend and he could tell something was up. I feel disappointed in myself, but I don't want to get up out of this bed at all.
I ended up crying to my boyfriend, expressing the fear of not getting better.
It feels like I'm ""not even here"". I'm a house with the lights off.

12:35 a.m.- this feels like the depression equivalent to an anxiety attack. I feel this crippling numb weird depressed feeling that I can barely attempt to describe, and nothing is comforting me. My boyfriend hugging me, wanting to play video games with me, or watching a funny movie, it seems nothing is comforting me through this and I'm just riding it out. And by that I mean, I'm going to hope I can just pass out. This is not foreign to me, I've just never been too good at describing it.. it sounds so dramatic to say nothing is right, but that's all that comes to mind. I resent myself for being this way 

3:32 a.m.- can't really sleep. I don't feel like I'm having a panic attack, but my heart is kind of thumping. ",11Nov2017,4
