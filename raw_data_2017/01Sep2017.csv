0,"1. I still struggle with writing full posts or comments, but deleting them before posting. It's one of the things that causes my OCD to wake me up in the middle of the night with extreme feelings of guilt, thinking I said something online that I shouldn't have. Usually, upon checking, I find that I didn't post any of the things I feel so ashamed of.

2. I've spent a lot of time in different therapies and learned a lot of more effective ways to manage my various instabilities. I've gotten really good at using those coping tools and most of the time my struggles with mental health go completely unnoticed (good thing). What I forgot, is just how much mental fortitude it takes to put these things into practice all day, every day, even if I'm not actively focused on it. I've been sick for the past week with a viral infection, so my mental and emotional functioning has been stunted along with physical wellbeing. My mental illnesses have been taking full advantage of how weak I've felt all week. I haven't had the same mental strength as usual to consistently practice my tools from therapy, so I almost fell into a bad headspace that I wouldn't have been able to get out of. Extreme loneliness, petty behaviour, and dangerous thinking traps. I'm grateful that I noticed these things before I hit any kind of crisis.

3. Something that tends to frustrate me quite a bit is one of the questions used for screening in cases of depression: ""Have you lost interest in things you used to enjoy?"" For me, that answer is always, ""No."" But here's why: I have been living with dysthymia since I was 11, with recurrent major depressive episodes (each major episode usually lasting 6 months to 1 year). I am going to be 24 in a few weeks. I developed severe depression before I ever developed genuine interests or passions of my own. I haven't lost interest in anything, because I cannot remember what it actually feels like to enjoy things. I really don't know. It's not an actual problem for me, just one of those little frustrations that I come across every now and then.

4. In previous years, I was far more focused on my mental health and physical health (chronic illnesses) than how I actually felt about me as a person. For the past year, I have been completely off of psychotropic medication -- the only daily med I take now is to manage intestinal spasms -- so I've recently been reaping the benefits of having a much clearer mind. All the medication I took previously was absolutely necessary at the time, but unfortunately it was more keep things stable rather than to aid in seeking contentment. So... at 23, I recently became aware that... I may very well be transgender. This is a difficult thing for me to swallow. I had an appointment with a gender clinic in my area for a consultation and to help me sort things a bit in my head. There were a lot of tears, not much more clarity as of yet, and I still can't really think about it much without getting overly upset... there was talk of internalized transphobia, which does make sense in my case. Of course, I still really don't want to be ""that"" person. I'm sure you know what I mean by that. A history of mental illness already reduces a lot of my credibility in regards to how I feel physically, and I can only imagine it would also reduce a lot of my credibility for how I feel as an identity in my own mind. I won't get into that any further... 

This has been an exercise for me to practice writing things on my mind without negating what I've written by erasing it. Thanks for reading.",01Sep2017,1
1,"I rarely smoke weed. I recently smoked with someone and I felt my  energy shut off. I felt like I closed off from that person and I have yet to open up. Maybe it was all in my head but ever since, I have been severely depressed  and cannot feel love pass through me. I get extremely nervous in social settings. I cannot think straight. I’m not sure if this was due to the marijuana. I feel like I lost control of my conscious mind. I’m still confused about what happened. I feel no joy or excitement. I can’t laugh. I see everything in a negative light. Anyone have any idea what happened or have any idea what I can do to fix it? I wanted to try smoking again to see if anything would happen, if I could somehow bring some light back in. This is probably poorly explained I just don't know wtf happened.",01Sep2017,0
2,"i don't even know where to start with this post. i'm 30. i have a good job, a cat, a car and a condo. 

today, my boss and i were talking and i snapped at him and he walked away from me. his communication with how he wants things done, changes and i don't always understand why. today i was pressuring that i didn't understand and saying it's not what he said before and then i basically ended the convo by saying ""well, i don't want to argue so i'll do"" blah blah blah. 

yesterday, i was told by ford canada that because my car was out of warranty they couldn't help me, even though they've given me extended warranty on some specific pieces because i've had so many issues with my car. anything past those pieces, i'm fucked. the dealership cannot figure out what is wrong with the car and wanted to replace something, ford said no. now i want the dealership to try a part and they say they can't because even though it's on the list, it's not a concerning piece at this point.  i cannot afford to pay for repairs myself or trade the vehicle in. 

i have no friends. i go to work and come home every day. i go horseback riding once a week, but will likely quit because i need to save the money now because of the pos car. 

the last time i hung out with ""friends"" i got mocked all night because i kept using the wrong words - which made sense, they just weren't the right words. i left balling. i was kind of drunk. 

i have no one to talk to. my parents and i talk mostly every day, but when i say something to my mom, her exact response is 'yeah, well today I'... or she just changes the subject. if i call them past 5-6pm, they're both drunk. they're both alcoholics. i had called her one night because i got thrown off the horse into a jumping standard and she was slurring her words. i told her it was a bad idea for me to have called her and she said ""what, why?"". i told her because she was slurring her words and i didn't like talking to her when she was like that (my dad had answered and he was also drunk, he's the instigator, didn't want to pay attention to my story because he couldn't understand what i was saying about all this horsey jumping thing. IT WAS A FUCKING JUMP STANDARD). anyways, mom got a bit upset and we hung up. i called them the next day, she had no recollection of the call and did not ask how i was feeling. 

i'm scared i'm fucking up at work because i have absolutely no motivation. there's a new kid and my boss has given him some of my projects with no communication to me. he often changes things on my projects and doesn't tell me. when clients call me and ask i look like i'm fucking retarded because i have no idea whats going on with the projects. i've talked to him about this.

my boss told me they want me to be a team lead one day. he's also told me that he wants me to start reviewing others work. he'll give me one thing and then that's it. i don't know if he stops because i missed something or what the fuck.

i don't know what to do any more.

the girl who i thought was my best friend. we've been in and out of friendships. the last time she was seeing this guy and started working up north (oil patch). we started hanging out less. i always tried but she was either at work or busy. then she used me as an excuse to cheat on her ex.  i ran into her at a pub one night. she said she was happy to see me. i don't understand why she couldn't have invited me out. we eventually stopped talking again, she made no effort. then we started and she was engaged to another guy. she asked me to be her maid of honour. i said yes and tried to plan an awesome night. the other girls she invited, i asked for their input and they gave none. when i explained the plan, they complained to her. i was in the middle of breaking up with my ex. 

my ex. i told myself i would never be one of those girls. never let a boy lie to me or treat me like i was worthless. oh he lied. although he's never admitted it, i'm sure he cheated. we got herpes together. somehow. we don't know which one of us got it first.  i broke up with him. told him i was done with his shit and him talking to other girls the way he did. he begged me for months. eventually i gave back in. my 28th birthday weekend. amazing. then i got sick, just a cold. he was leaving on a boys weekend golf trip. he packed condoms. i removed them and put a note saying fuck you. 

he got my terrible cold. ruined his trip. 

my highschool best friend. she never calls/texts. but always wants to know when i'm home; i live 10 hours away. we hang out and always have a great time. but that's it. 

i haven't had sex in 3 years. my 28th birthday weekend. i try and make friends. the older i get the more socially awkward as fuck i am. even the horse people think i'm weird. 

pick up a new hobby, you'll say. there's something about me people don't like. i don't know any more.

oh. my doc diagnosed me with mild depression. i never told her i didn't want to exist. just that i had bad days sometimes. i'm going to try an iud rather than the pill to see if that helps me (periods are baddddd - don't gotta worry bout no babies). she referred me to a clinic. they denied me as i wasn't bad enough?... i giggled during the 20min phone conversation. i cry if i don't laugh. i didn't want to cry at work. think i did anyways.",01Sep2017,28
3,"I am from America.

I feel really lonely when I'm alone and I don't know how to be comfortable with being alone. 

I am off at college for my last semester. One student kept trying to switch rooms with me in a room I had renew my lease on bc the apartment messed up and he was supposed to live w my roommates. I made an offer to him to pay for the things I'd have to replace and also for the inconvenience of having to move my things. He kept changing the details and then wanted to do it under the table and that's something I'm really not comfortable with and he also offered prices too low. Now his 3 friends are my roommates but I don't want to be forced out out of my apartment this way. I said whatup to them but I don't feel welcome bc they're prob mad at me for not agreeing with their friends but I'm not the type of kid to not fully use my apartment bc of this situation. I have a few friends here who only like to go out with me about 4-5. I don't really like going out that much because I feel socially awkward especially after I've quit drinking (sober since January). I want to meet girls to get involved with that but that's on the backburner before making friends and getting better conversational skills. I take care of my health, eat well, workout. I have 1 other good friend here she doesn't drink so I can pretty much do anything with her but she is a bit of a goody two shoes. Still a good person and a good person to hang out with but I feel like one person isn't good enough. I have one really close friend that's a girl (we're intimate) that I skype a lot and I don't think about loneliness when I'm with her. I also have one best friend but he lives in my home state and he makes me laugh like crazy and feel awesome and we text but he is slow on responses and I don't blame him he's busy. I plan to join a few clubs and just talking to cashiers ( I already do that ) and talking to people in class, but I did that last semester ( minus joining clubs) and I still felt lonely. 

What are some techniques, practices, I can take on to become strong in being alone and maybe even enjoy it? To cope I usually watch video game streams where the guys are funny, or this talk show called Everyday Struggle. I facetime my mom, little brother and that girl or text my friend. These are all just coping methods though, how do I actually truly become comfortable though? Thank you so much!",01Sep2017,2

5,"Folks,

This is me at my wit's end and not knowing where else to post something like this. 

My brother is nineteen years old. At the age of sixteen he kind of just snapped. He attempted to take his own life and was diagnosed with bipolarity disorder. He got help from doctors and seemed to be doing better at times. 

Last year he dropped out of college and he has what appears to be zero motivation for anything other than remixing a single passion pit song over and over again. He doesn't go to school and he has never held a job. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day (bought by my parents) and doesn't do a single chore to help them. His room is utterly disgusting at this point. 

So where we are now: 
My mother did everything she could to enroll him in school again and he just decided he is going to drop out again. To top it off my parents then bought him an oculus rift because they feel bad that he is having a difficult time; and It's been these handouts for three years now. This is driving me to my wit's end. 

I love my brother and I try to be sympathetic to his issues. I can never know what it's like to be someone with that type of infliction. But it's like my parents have given up on parenting him because they are afraid of pushing him and breaking him down. I am a firm believe that one needs to face challenges head on to grow. And all I see is my brother being coddled and getting unearned handouts and it's robbing him of becoming the adult he could be. I just want what's best for him in the long run. Is tough love a bad thing in this situation?  Is there some way to motivate him? Will this ever pass?

Sorry if there are any typos I'm on my phone and a little teary eyed. I don't know anyone else who has a family member who's attempted suicide or has bipolarity. If I even get one response I'd be surprised, but thanks. ",01Sep2017,1
6,"First time posting, just felt like venting today. 

I've dealt with mild depression for a while and for about a year its been pretty manageable. But every once in a while those waves of ""i feel like shit and i deserve to feel like shit"" seem to ebb up again in the back of my mind. One thing that never really seems to help with managing my feelings is motivational writings- in fact these usually have an adverse effect on me. 

Let me preface this by saying that i think motivational writings are great in that they help many people express their emotions and connect with others that have undergone hardships. Its great when people have a healthy emotional outlet! If they help you, please don't listen to my whininh and you keep on doing you. But, they've never really worked for me. 

Whenever i encounter some post with a quote similar to ""you are worth more than you think you are!"" Or ""choose who you want to be!"" I immediately feel like shit. Usually my thought process will go along the lines of ""this is fucking stupid"" to ""stop being such a negative person"" to ""well i still feel bad so i guess this is my fault"" to ""now i feel bad for choosing to feel bad"" to ""this is stupid that i feel bad over feeling bad over something about not feeling bad"" and so on. Like jeez, i was having a dandy day up until i stumbled upon that positive wuote about self love or whatever. I actually was feeling confidentish until this made me question my confidence. 

And i know it's neither the quotes nor their writers' faults-its just me being me. Oh well",01Sep2017,5
7,"I feel like I'm trapped in a cage, stuck in some sort of twisted Groundhog Day scenario where each day mirrors the last.

I don't know what to do and I'll be honest, the thought of some soft talking psychoanalyzing doctor with a clipboard? It makes my skin crawl. 

I don't know what I'm looking for with this post, I just feel like I'm losing my mind and any opportunity to achieve anything, stuck in this twisted, monotonous loop every day.

8,"Hi, I am 16, I smoked a lot of weed 6-7 months ago for 3-4 months. I live in an apartment and we have a strong policy against smoking weed. When I would smoke weed, I would hear voices that I tought were my upstairs neighbors. I knew they weren't real because I would often ask my brother if he heard someone yelling and he would say no. They would yell things like : 
I'm calling the police!!
It smells like weed, it smells so bad!
He is so high!
I could actually answer them with my thinking voice inside my head, I could tell them to shut the fuck up and they would tell me to shut the fuck up too.

You get the idea. Looked it up online, people said it was normal and common, brushed it off.

Before school one morning, smoked a lot of weed, went into the shower. I was cleaning my penis when all of a sudden I saw a big white worm come out of my penis. Freaked the fuck out. When I was done I sat on the toilet and started looking at my penis. I was seeing worms crawling on it. Called my mom, woke up my brother and I tried to show him evidence. I was giving him hair that I found on my penis. I believe that's called the ""matchbox sign"". I was also seeing little worms on my bed, I got on my knees and I was showing them to my brother. He eventually made me realize that I was completely disconnected of reality. It only lasted while I was high.

1 month later. I'm high and drinking a glass of water, as I swallow water, I see a worm floating in my glass of water. It's now in my mouth and I feel it on the tip of my tongue. Started freaking the fuck out, tried pulling it out. After like 30 attempts I pull it out, it now between my fingers and I can see it. It dives back in my mouth. I realised that I was delusional, stopped. Once again, it only lasted while I was high.

Had 2 intense mushrooms badtrip, I tought I was becoming schizphrenic, I was losing control of my limbs. Was also seeing bugs everywhere.

Since my last mushroom badtrip, I feel things crawling on me but I know there is nothing. Even while I'm in bed.

I stopped smoking weed and doing drugs.

I think about all those things pretty much constantly, which causes a lot of anxiety. I fear becoming schizo in a few years because I fucked up with drugs...

9,"Hey everyone! I recently stopped taking Lexapro after taking it for about 3.5-4 months. Before that, I was taking Prozac for about 6 months. 
Before this period of antidepressants, I was on a cocktail of daily klonopin, celexa, and a few others...

My point is, I have been through the withdrawal process a few times, and unfortunately am aware of all the withdrawal affects of the drugs.

Most recently, when I stopped taking the Lexapro, I experienced new symptoms and was just wondering if anyone has some insight or anyone has experience similar issues. The main issue is I am about 2 or 3 days late for my period. I couldn't find much information browsing around, but is this a common symptom associated with withdrawal? I have also been experiencing some GI issues (upset stomach, etc...)

Nothing else in my life (diet or exercise habits, stress, etc) has changed except for stopping Lexapro and all SSRIs/antidepressants, so I guess I was just wondering if these were common symptoms?

14,"My sister is 21. She's incredible. But she's incredibly insecure, constantly feels anxious and overwhelmed even by normal situations. She says the smallest things discourage her and she cries whenever she is somewhere that makes her uncomfortable. She says that she hates herself and she never feels good enough for anyone or anything, which is a terrible thing to feel at 21 when you are in an environment where there is so much pressure to graduate college, get a job, be successful and do it with ease.

It took long enough to convince her to the benefits of therapy. Her biggest criticism was ""why do I need to pay someone to tell me what I already know?"" I think after finding herself in numerous positions where she does not know how to react and is surprised by her own actions, she has come around to the idea of getting professional help for her anxiety.

My mother on the other hand...

Now don't get me wrong, my mother is an equally wonderful woman who loves her children more than anything. She wants the best for all of us but has had bad experiences with other family members seeking therapy. She is not for the idea because she thinks therapists will always blame the parents and that her consolation should be enough for my sister and her anxiety.

Above all, I am afraid that my sister will resort to unhealthy or self-harming behavior if we do not act on the issue. How can I sell my old fashioned family on the idea of therapy for my sister?

You… You are the one… The very one… The only one… The absolute, unequaled by any who has ever come before or after, one… The utmost incomparable one… The one person, one memory, one idea that I cannot, will not, dare not forget. Your embrace squeezes and constricts around my heart, leaving me gasping for breath, for life.


A friend you are, and have always been… A lover, almost…Yet we did not… I could not… I was trapped… Bound by honour, my heart not free. What we almost had, I longed for since first we met… Years passed… Dreams passed… We drifted, came back, friends throughout. Then you… you were there, unexpected, looking at me how I hoped one day you would. You did… You wanted me the way that I wanted you. We were there… You were there! It was not a dream… And yet still it was… For it could never have been… I told myself I was doing the right thing. I could not… With every inch of my flesh, every thump of my racing heart, I wanted to… I could not… I could not lose control. I had to be rational, had to be true, though not to myself.


Four years before… You told me you almost… and I told you, you should have… If I’d have known you wanted… I would have… Then time went on. I thought that chance was gone forever. Then you were there. It was right. We were right… but I was not free. With every passing day, I feel… I try to let go… I thought you had forgotten we’d almost… Then I saw you again. You came… a special trip just for me. Two friends, like old times. Yet, still I can’t forget… I thought you had… but then you said… “that time we almost…” and in spite of myself, I grinned. My heart jumped. You remember! I doubted… I convinced myself… believed you never thought about… but then you said it.


Four years before… you almost… and you should have…. Then finally we were there… “That time we almost…” We should have… I should have.


Three years have passed. And I know that you are not… and that she is now… Yet still you said… “that time we almost…” I know you love her. She is good for you… but still you think about “that time we almost…” And I am still bound… bound on shaky ground. And though I love him… I cannot let go… “that time we almost…”


Four years before… and then again… “that time we almost…”
Three years have passed. Three years since then… “that time we almost…”
Perhaps one more? We may again… “a time we almost…”

22,"So long story short I've been wrestled with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager.  Developed a substance abuse problem in my late teens.  Eventually discovered a lot of my stuff is routed in trauma from when I was a kid, essentially PTSD.

Now in my 30s and I've gotten a grip on that stuff.  The big problem is I still have issues with my temper, specifically losing my cool when I'm in conflict with people I'm close too (family and SO), I don't always see it coming but I just lose it and start saying deliberately hurtful things.  Like really really bad.

Been trying to deal with this for the last 15+ months, been about a month since my last flare-up (pretty small).  Currently seeing a therapist and participating in a CBT anger management program but Im worried its not enough.  I've damaged a lot of relationships in my life and I don't want to keep doing it.

30,"So just as a quick history this isn't the first time this has happened. 6 years ago we were able to admit him in to a mental ward after his first episode. He suffers from some major neck pain a took some medical marijuana from a ""trusted source"" which we later found out was spice. That's what started all of this. He was fine when he was able to be checked out for years but suffered another lighter episode after a long time girlfriend he was living with cheated on him and they ended the relationship. We didn't admit him that time but just kept a close eye on him and he recovered. 

This week he ended another long term relationship with a girl and got in a huge fight with his mother. He lives with my brother and his family and his work called yesterday to say they were worried about his mental state and my brother had to go pick him up and drive him home. My other brother and I went over to try and support and assess the situation and he seemed functional but obviously distressed. Come to find out he hasn't slept in the past three days and has been taking what he called a muscle relaxer for his neck. My brother says that he was actually taking medical marijuana from a ""trusted source"" again. We live in UT so it's illegal here and there's no way to get an actual prescription from a doctor. He slept for like two hours while we were there, woke up, and said he needed to take his medicine. Right after it was clear to see the signs of the breakdown, he was talking about going to Houston out of the blue to give people handwritten notes telling them people loved them and to breath, handing out comfort beads and such. He also started saying his mind works differently than everyone else's. Talking about how we needed to watch the movie Leap because it changed his life, spouting off nonsense about how the government and cia operate and what they're currently up to and other such things. 

Whenever we bring up that were worried about his health and well being heat insists he's fine and gets very upset about it, my sister in law left the house for the weekend because she's nervous about it. I want him to at least talk to a doctor if not get him admitted again but he won't hear any of it. 

He didn't sleep last night he was up posting on Facebook about speaking with the redcross about going to Houston and raising funds for it. Making multiple new profile pictures. Posting stuff about belonging to the universe and whatnot. 

I don't know what to do, he's a grown man and I can't force him to go to the doctor. 

Is anyone we can report the situation to or a doctor we can call about it? I don't think this a situation the police need to be involved in but something needs to be done before it gets worse I just don't know what

TL;DR: my cousin is obviously suffering a mental breakdown and might end up doing something highly irresponsible. We try talking to him about seeing a doctor but he gets really mad about it and I don't know what to do.

37,"one year ago for 1-2 week i was just sitting in my little room and played NBA 2k on my pc all day while i was depressed. And then this feeling started to grow.It's like something's eating my brain.Very painful, very harming.Some people say it's stress. I don't know what stress is like.And now i can't be in front of a computer or playing on my playstation 4 without getting this ""brain cancer"" shit feeling.I guess my depression was a factor in this, I got bored and not be interested in gaming and being online. i stopped playing for a while, and try use computer as less as possible.But even if i not using them in this last  2 months it's still there.I can't do what i like to do ,maybe I'm not interested in these things anymore deep down. I try to be outside and do other things, but i'll be at home sometimes you can't be elsewhere for a full 24 hours.Programmers be in front of computer 8 hours a day and still not going insane.

39,"Hello /r/mentalhealth, hope everyone's having a good day!

I've got some stuff going on in my head and I'm afraid of going to the doctors to get help. The last doctor I approached about my mental health 3~ years ago told me that I couldn't be developing schizophrenia because I had insight in to my condition and sent me away with no follow up. I'm terrified of going to the doctor, explain my thoughts for them to section me (admit me to a hospital). Can this happen?

I pretty clearly suffer from DPDR, which was manageable until a few months ago when I started suffering from different symptoms. I'm paranoid, believe that my frontal lobe is eroding (I can physically feel it, even though I'm fully aware that the brain doesn't have any pain sensors), my attention span has been completely ruined and am going through what I believe to be a manic cycle. I've lost hours of my day I cannot remember and it's starting to get worrying.

What do it do? I feel like I know the answer is ""suck it up and get help"", but I need to hear it from an external source. ",02Sep2017,6

41,"I feel like I have a lot of difficulty with self control. This manifests in almost all aspects of my life:

University: I'm getting a Master's degree and for that I have to read literature/scientific papers. I tend to note down every single fact written in them and try to remember them word by word; This backfires very quickly when I take 3 hours to read 2 pages and I stress out, not progressing at all.

Weight lifting: I tend to go for absolutely perfect form on every single repition; This backfires when it stops me from progressing with SLIGHTLY worse form, or stops me from considering different variations of exercises that would be better suited for my physiology.

Relationships: I tend to try and be as nice as possible; This backfires when I actually end up doing less with friends due to considering it stressfull at some point.

I could go on but I think this gives a great overview. Is there anyone with a similar problem? I have tried being more relaxed but I only know two extremes, over-analyzing everything and trying to perfect it or not caring enough and making a lot of mistakes. Has anyone found a middle ground? If so, how?",02Sep2017,1

43,"I'm young, early teens but I have a serious problem.

I, for the last 4(ish) months, I've been feeling rather down and in some cases suicidal.

I've had this problem before when I was about 11 (ik seems unreal...), but it's now getting worse.

I have trouble doing a lot of things, and in most cases I can't do things right. And if something needs done, I need to be told, and I can't figure it out. 

Everyday feels like I'm being whined at, moaned at or complained at. I try my hardest but I just can't do things right. It never seems to stop and I try explaining but I'm just called lazy and ignorant.

Right now it's getting to the point where suicide is the easiest way out because for gods sake, I ain't enjoying this ride.

I am getting more and more depressed everyday, and I try and not let people know because I know it will be a bad persona for everyone else. I suppress my feelings as well.

I don't know if it's that or if it's because I don't know how to, but can someone please help me.

I feel I am going to kill myself soon and for god sake I need a reason to live.

46,"Please don't be offended about this question, I really don't mean to upset anyone.

I've been looking into PTSD lately due to the fact I remember almost nothing from primary school (I'm 14, female, from UK) whilst my friends remember almost everything (like my friends dating various people, me doing dumb stuff ETC.) It's also due to the fact I've been having panic attacks, and memories popping up at seemingly random times.

I don't know if I have it but I have become interested in the subject.

Please don't be offended.
Thank you for reading and any answers you give. ",02Sep2017,3

49,"One day Jimmy woke up,
And he felt like he couldn't smile.
He ran to ease the pain, 
But mile after mile. 

Jimmy heard the voices,
They told him he was no good.
He asked if he should end it all, 
The voices said he should.

As everyone else sunbathed,
Jimmy stood in the rain,
As much as he tried to escape,
The rainclouds came back again.

Jimmy didn't know, what he had to do,
All he knew was everyday,
He felt like he was screwed.

You see, Jimmy isn't a bad guy,
Like everyone he wants the best,
But Jimmy sometimes feels like,
He's just not like the rest.

Jimmy knows that others,
Struggle with their life,
But Jimmy's life seems different,
Like, constantly full of strife.

Jimmy tries hard, to fix the error of his ways,
But Jimmy doesn't get many good...
It's usually always bad days.
People say, ""Jimmy, your mood is a choice"",
That's everyone except, for the one little voice.

Jimmy feels trapped, 
Like every plan fails,
Jimmy wishes he could tell someone,
But they're bored of Jimmy's tales.

Jimmy tells people he's fat,
And Jimmy's jokes he's poor.
But Jimmy knows these aren't the real issues,
There's quite clearly something more.

But Jimmy can't tell anyone,
What exactly would he say.
So he just repeats the same old stories,
Day after day.

Jimmy’s trying to get fit,
But he thinks, what’s the point?
Because he already knows,
He'll still wake up feeling shit.

You see, Jimmy's been here before,
So Jimmy already knows,
And yet time and time again,
This is how Jimmy's story goes.

Jimmy tells people, that he's going to get fit.
And for a brief moment, Jimmy’s awesome, 
he doesn't feel like shit.

But then the little voice, that's inside of Jimmy's head,
Tells Jimmy he'd be better off, if only he were dead.

So Jimmy has a voice,
that is telling him to die,
But Jimmy want to better himself, 
So Jimmy continues to try.

Jimmy works hard, and he starts to make some moves,
But the voice in Jimmy's head, 
Always wins the fight for Jimmy's mood.

Jimmy can't stop the voice,
As much as Jimmy tries,
So, Jimmy tries other ways, 
To make the little voice die.

Jimmy goes to the bar, 
And Jimmy starts to drink,
For a little while it works;
Jimmy can barely think. 

But then Jimmy wakes up, 
And the voice is back again.
Which is why Jimmy feels like, 
He’s always stood in the rain.

Imagine being Jimmy,
And hearing voices everyday,
Voices always abusing you,
And you just can't get away.

Imagine being Jimmy, 
Who tries to have a good day,
But the voice in Jimmy's head, 
ends up having his way.

So Jimmy starts to fight,
Jimmy starts to get mad.
What is wrong with Jimmy?
Why does Jimmy always look sad?

To the outside nothing's wrong,
Jimmy's just acting up,
But every day from dawn til dusk,
Jimmy’s being beaten up.

People start to look at Jimmy,
Like Jimmy's a little weird,
This is exactly what Jimmy, 
Had honestly, always feared.

Because now Jimmy's not just having,
The fights in his head,
Jimmy’s having fights,
With the whole world instead.

Who does Jimmy trust?
Where does Jimmy turn?
If eventually Jimmy knows,
The bridge will eventually burn?

So Jimmy hides away,
Jimmy makes excuses.
Jimmy doesn’t bother to fight,
Because he knows,
Eventually he always loses.",02Sep2017,2
