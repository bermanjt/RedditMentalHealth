However when looking into therapists or counselors or whatever there a million options and I'm not sure where to go for my particular issue.

Any guidance is extremely appreciated.",25Sep2017,1
1,"So my brother likes to give hugs, he just walks up and hugs you, but it's not a good hug and often comes at inconvenient times, and the rest of the time he's a complete asshole. I'm not a person who likes lots of physical contact, ESPECIALLY when I'm stressed, which is always and usually because of him. I will hug someone when I damn well please, I don't like forced, prolonged contact and I want to be able to say no without being called a rat or a jerk.

Example
Just now he came into my room while I'm trying to get our 2 year old sister to sleep, and she's very resistant, he comes in, without permission which I hate and he knows it, says he wants to say hello and wants a hug, I tell him he doesnt need to say hello and he's already given hugs, he insists so I get more irritated cause I'm so overwhelmed with everything and he just WILL NOT LISTEN, he then leaves, comes back and slams my door, comes back again and says not to do anything nice to make up for it and slams it again. Here comes the guilt.

I don't want to feel guilty. I feel like I'm completely in the right to say no to hugs, especially when trying to get a resistant 2 year old to sleep.",25Sep2017,2
2,"I didn't always use to be like this. I use to have goals, dreams, passion for things. I use to be happy, Now the happiest moment of my life is falling asleep.
I use to be a good boyfriend, a good friend, a good student but now I'm garbage. People look at me in disgust and wonder how I got were I am. I lost my job what seems like two weeks ago turns into the four month anniversary. All I do is sleep.
It feel like I've given up things that make me person. I feel more like a primitive being. I wake up, use the rest room, entertain myself for two hours, masturbation then right back to sleep, repeat. I only eat if my stomach pushes me to the point of nausea.
I have no self-esteem it seems like. I've been on a hook up bender. Thank God I was smart enough to be protected but maybe I'm lonely. I really have no friends, no people I click with in this huge college city I live in.
It feels like nobody likes me. I feel like no one can be trusted. I don't fit in, I don't belong. It makes me physically sick, emotionally mad and weak just seeing other people happy, Seeing classmates, friends starting a family or achieving their dreams while I wallow in an empty shell in who I use to be.
I feel like when I look in the mirror my image is mocking myself because when I see myself that's not the person who I am. I have the eyes and the face of someone sweet, smart and genuine but when I look at myself I know it's a mirage. I'm vile, ugly and dishonest.
I don't blame anyone or anything but myself. Sometimes a feel like I've already died and I'm just waiting for my body to die. All I do is lay in bed all day and try to sleep. Everything feels like a struggle, like a while that keeps me immobile in my place. I can't study, do anything productive, clean, cook, just every small thing feels like a huge tedious chore. I feel like I have no purpose. I'm not good at anything. I just love my video games.
I've been seeking help and been taking 150mg of Sertraline to help. I just want to let you guys know that I am not in any danger and I don't plan to give up. I just want to know if anyone has felt similar to me and if you ever got over it. Medication wise? Other ways?",25Sep2017,2
3,"First, I realize this is something I need to make my own decision on.  I’m posting this because I’m sure some of you could shed some light on my concerns. 

I have depression. I’ve had it for what seems like my whole life. My therapist thinks it may be a persistent, low grade dysthymia but it often feels more severe. I have trouble concentrating at work.  I have a constant feeling of low energy/motivation.  I’m forgetful and irritable and decisions are anxiety-ridden and take a long time, and I don't respond as timely as most people do in regular conversation.  I feel like I’ve been getting dumber. I have a perpetual “you are such a piece of shit” Bojack-esque voice in my head. 

I just started seeing a therapist again for the fourth time in the last 12 years. She referred to the slow thinking/moving as psychomotor retardation. Honestly, I was happy there was a word for it.  She thinks I would respond well to medication.  I’ve been on meds before: celexa, lexapro, prystiq, some coupled with wellbutrin. I’m not sure they ever actually helped. I never felt much different. Granted, when I first started, my family situation was rough. And then in college I drank too much and smoked marijuana habitually. Three times I went off my meds to trip on mushrooms (terrible experience) as SSRIs block the effects. I’ve been off them since about 2012. 

In July I tried MDMA (aka Ecstasy, Molly) for the first time.  I had an amazing time and I didn’t experience a deep seratonin-depleted depression like I expected to feel afterwards. In fact I felt much better than normal even 24 hours later. It was a truly clarifying, love-filled positive experience. 

It's something I want to explore and try again.  It infused me with just a little more confidence and it has, for the most part, stuck. Unfortunately, SSRIs significantly reduce the effects of the drug and I’ve read it can be dangerous to mix.  My boyfriends have only recently believed in depression as a legitimate condition, let alone that medication could help me.  They and my therapist are concerned that I may be trading 99% of my time for several hours. They’ve told me they think it’s silly to forego medication that will cut many of my symptoms in favor of having fun for one night a month (the tolerance on MDMA goes up really fast). I keep flipping back and forth.  I would have to stop taking the meds at least a month ahead of time to experience the drug again...

My last therapist promoted mindfulness.  There was a time where I meditated 45 min a day religiously for almost a month and I felt excellent.  But I couldn’t even get myself to that point now.  Last year at this time I’d started working out religiously and lost 25 pounds and gained some actual muscle.  But thinking about starting again just makes me want to stay home.  I’ve been up and down ~20 pounds a couple times over the last year. I’m trying to keep from eating lots of junk food right now and it’s taking lots of energy. 

Maybe I should use the SSRIs as a jump start to healthier habits to help me cope and then get off of them?  Maybe I just don't like facing limitations?  I’m looking forward to hearing what some of you have to say…I’m sure it's a core philosophy of this subreddit but please, no judgements.

The indecision is real...


TLDR: Want to get on SSRIs but also want to roll on MDMA again, feel that both are beneficial but SSRIs cancel effects of MDMA",25Sep2017,2
4,"I'm a teenager and just last year I've noticed that I've changed a lot. I remember when in elementary school we would take crushes really lightly and throw around the term. Recently, I found out what a crush really feels like. It's cool to just think about someone that you really, really like. The problem is, I'm not in a very stable mental state, and it's really taking a hit at my self-esteem. I feel like that person is perfect, and further feel like I am wrong or could never be loved. Suddenly, crushes aren't a new cool thing that comes with growing up. They're a barrier preventing me from being happy. Honestly, if a friend told me someone had a crush on *me*, I'd probably laugh. Then cry. I don't really know what I'm asking for, but if anyone has something that might help me out or a story to share or whatever, feel free.",25Sep2017,1

7,"I know he's regarded as a very good therapist. He has decades of experience and has worked with many transgender clients (which I am). I'm comfortable in our sessions and willing to talk to him and all that, but I just... Don't feel like I'm achieving anything. 

I feel like the things he tells me are pretty obvious. For example, during our session today, I was telling him about issues in my home life. He responded with, ""that sounds like it would be very stressful for you."" Which I understand is supposed to give some reassurance but like...? I dunno, its obvious, and doesn't really... Change anything... Or help me deal with anything better.... Or? I don't know. 

Another common occurrence is if I'm talking about my depression. I'll say its very difficult for me to do basic things, like shower or clean up around the house. And he'll respond with, essentially ""you just have to do it."" Of course, he phrases it much more kindly but its still so obvious. Telling me that doesn't give me any new information or help me find more motivation or understand why I feel the way I do or literally anything. Its like I go into an echo chamber for an hour and just get told stuff I already knew. 

I did bring this up with him in a previous session but he told me I just need to give it more time. I don't know, though. Is it normal to feel this way?  ",25Sep2017,0

9,"My blog is a huge passion project of mine. Its premise is essentially to get some of the rougher, longer, and harder to explain stories out there when it comes to mental health. I got tired of seeing people ""struggling"" for three months and posting their ""brave"" stories of recovery while I've been sitting here for going on four years all sorts of fucked up. (Can you taste the bitterness?)

Anyway, my blog is really important and I'm doing everything I can to get it out there and help others who need it find it. I want so desperately to help people (and that's its own issue), but I'm worried about the reaction I might get on Facebook. Namely, one of two outcomes: fake messages of ""support"" or nothing at all. I'm not sure which one I hate the idea of more. 

People close to me and family mostly know what's going on with me, but not all of them know the details, and still that's a very small group of people. 

Most of the people I have on Facebook are family members or acquaintances from high school or university, but mostly high school. I don't have the best memories from high school, though none of the specific people involved are my Facebook friends. 

All that said, I know how reassuring and comforting it is to see that other people are also suffering and I'm happy to help others or be a ressource if it makes a difference. Aaaaand I know that part of helping end stigma is to not be ashamed and that's the reason my name and picture are on my blog. 

Anyway, I'm just really anxious about the prospect of negative or disingenuous (or lack of) feedback and I hate not feeling prepared or aware of what's to come. Does anyone have any advice or experience, by chance?",25Sep2017,2

So I am fairly certain I have tourettes, not diagnosed yet, But I'd like your guys help / input. I have some really bad tics and some not so bad ones but they are mostly situational except for eyebrow scrunches and mumbling dudetude and stuff like that which rhymes. Other minor ones smacking lips saying boop, etc.

The main two tics I have are dangerous for my physical and mental health. It involves whenever I hear a noise I deem gross (sneezing coughing [ironic in a sec], chewing, or that sort of thing. When that trigger happens i need to cough then spit, if I don't it eats me up inside slowly like a terrible itch until I cave.  Problem is that it's gotten exaggerated to that any sound that is even remotely close to coughing (even fucking creaks) that I have to do the tic.  Now you can see how that's dangerous, one it drives me crazy, two keeps me up at night since it's grown to any sound similar to coughing, and three I constantly spit on my carpet which has already given me mrsa once. 

These tics are HORRIBLE when eating and get amplified by 100, so there can be times I literally cough over 200 times until it feels right just to eat a bowl of goldfish. They are slowly driving me insane and I already had a two week period getting addicted to opiates due to it.

Reading this does this sound like tourettes? If so how can I prove it to my doctor because most of my tics I've learned to hide from the public other than main two. So far weed has helped the most getting my mind off them but I can no longer do it due to a whole nother text wall so I can't do that. 

And lastly what treatment would help the most if my doctor believes me? I really need your guys help, untreated I can't last much longer in this life :( thank you in advance",25Sep2017,3

18,"Hi.

I'm exhausted. I've been through dozens of mental health professionals, be they psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists in my native Australia... I go to group therapy every week as well. Yesterday I lost my antipsychotic coverage and was told that I likely have DID which they can't prescribe those drugs for in spite of how they fucking told me that the people I hear aren't real. I'm 19 by the way. ""Your head is screwed on right"", they meant I'm not schizophrenic but then they just told me to leave because they couldn't help me.

I can't even think right now! I lost my job and can't keep to community college. I miss appointments, I have no friends, I'm running out of money and time. And last night I was so angry at the psychs I saw that I stabbed my thigh inches deep with a boot dagger and damaged a nerve and was about to collapse from blood loss when I got to the ER. They stitched the wound closed and got my blood pressure back to normal overnight but couldn't tell me how long the nerve damage would last. This is the worst self harm I've done but I have hundreds of other scars mainly from razors. I'm not suicidal anymore, but I love blood and hurting myself, and hurting other people much the same.

Anyway, I'm here because I know I'm going to end up in mental hospital for a month again, or jail. And I'm beginning to give up on these ""professionals"" who are probably just agents of the devil to keep people like me distracted. And someone told me that maybe a long term supported accommodation arrangement might be good, where I'd be living in a house with other people with mental issues but close to round-the-clock care.

Voicemail from my daughter's step-mom. 

Dear, it's about Melanie. There's things going on with Melanie I need to talk to you about.  

I felt like I had been punched in the stomach.  

I left my desk, went downstairs, and went outside to call her back.  

Dear, I just wanted you to know that Shawn (son-in-law) and mel got into an argument in the car, and she made him pull over. She started beating on the car, she did a lot of damage but it's drivable. Melanie took off walking because she didn't want to come home.  Shawn brought the car home, and after he talked with Monica (grandmother in law) we felt the best thing for her would be to file a report and press charges to maybe get her some help. But as we were discussing it, Melanie called crying saying she was sorry, she loved him, she doesn't know why she keeps hurting everyone and the only way she knew how to stop was to kill herself.

So they called the police, and informed them that she was missing and suicidal. Her phone was off, but they were able to ping her phone to a nearby school. They couldn't find her,  and we don't know any of her friends. 

I was still at work, partially because I didn't know what to do.. What I could do, but I was in no condition to drive.. I was in no condition to work either.  I mostly cried at work. Coworker tried to come to me since I'm the lead right now.. and I managed to choke out... not now Dave.. I turned away, and broke down crying.. he asked if I was ok.. When I didn't say anything,  he said ok.. and walked away.. 

I downloaded a police scanner app, the channel covers police, fire and ems in town. 

I started to have a panic attack as I listened to the scanner.  Just because I was afraid of what I was going to hear. Eventually I heard on the scanner that they got a call to a suicidal female at her address.. sitting in the car cutting herself.. I texted the grandmother to get a follow up.. the police showed up, took my daughter in on a 5150. 

She they found her bleeding. And she was pissed the cops were called. 

I know what hospital she's in, but in her state of mind I feel she needs a day to calm down.  

I'm home now, and I can't stop crying.  My only baby tried to kill herself.  

Every time someone says hugs, or I'm sorry it just makes me cry even more.  I'm home alone, I don't have any body.  My fiance drives a truck up and down California.. So I'm just here.  I don't have friends because I'm social phobic.

36,"Hi all! First time posting, be gentle :) 

**This is a continuation of my post on r/Mindfulness about [anger](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/70vsa4/mindfulness_and_anger/)**.  I'd recommend giving it a read, though I'll include a TLDR. I wanted to extend it a little further and talk about Core Beliefs.

____

**TLDR of Part I**: I personally believe that anger is a *secondary emotion*, meaning that we don't feel angry until we feel another emotion first.  Think of it like a volcano - the anger is the eruption that you see on the surface, but there are other emotions (betrayal, fear, rejection, abandonment, etc.) and life stressors hiding below the surface. It's these *primary* emotions that lead to the anger. Now, onto part II! 

___

**How do we interpret our primary emotions**? We often get stuck in patterns of feeling the same emotions over and over in our daily lives. When we feel these emotion ""clusters"" often enough, they begin to shape how we view ourselves - they become our *Core Beliefs*. For example, maybe you often feel fearful, jealous, and insecure. Perhaps these emotions lead you to believe that you're ""not good enough."" This has become a core belief.

There are dozens upon dozens of different types of core beliefs, and we often have multiple beliefs all going on in the background of our thoughts at any given time.

**Examples of common core beliefs**:

* I'm stupid

* I'm worthless

* I'm bad/wrong/broken

* I'm ugly

* I'm not good enough

These core beliefs are like a pair of sunglasses that you wear everyday. Every situation is filtered through the lenses of these beliefs. For example, let's say that one of your core beliefs is that you're ugly. As you pass someone on the street, they suddenly laugh. Because you believe you're ugly, your immediate thought might be: ""They're laughing at me because I look stupid."" These **subjective** beliefs alter the way we view **objective** reality!

___

**How to Challenge Core Beliefs**: The most important thing to know about our core beliefs is that we can change them. We change them by *challenging* them.

1. Take a moment to write down *one* of your core beliefs.

2. Now, come up with *three* pieces of *objective* evidence that is contrary to the belief. So for example, if your belief is that you're stupid, you might write: 1. I aced my last test; 2. I graduated high school; 3.  People tell me I'm smart. These are all pieces of evidence to challenge your belief.

3. If your belief is something that can't be challenged with objective evidence, try the semantic approach. For example, if your belief is that you're ""broken,"" ask yourself, ""what does *broken* even mean?"" Sure, we know what it means when an object is broken; but how can a human possibly be broken? You'll soon see that it makes no sense. Yes we slip up sometimes, but that doesn't mean we're inherently ""bad"" or ""wrong;"" It just means we've made some poor choices in the past.

By identifying and challenging your core beliefs, you can help build your self-esteem! Remember, this takes time and practice, practice, practice!

42,"I made a friend last month who I have a complicated relationship with. I was wondering if this is a sign of some mental health condition or if anyone knows people like this in their lives.

She constantly gets very angry at people, most of the time without reason, blocks them on social media / avoids any contact in real life, and then a few days later unblocks and asks for another favor. For example, she asked one of her friends for help on a programming class that she is taking at University, and because he was not able to solve every problem on her homework by the due date, she became very angry at him and blocked him, even though she is ultimately responsible for her own grades. A few days later, she asked the guy for help on something else, then became very offended when he refused (who wouldn't?). There are 10+ other examples I could give that are similar to this situation but I don't want to bore you to death. Anyways, she did this to me a few days ago and now she added me on social media again, acting like nothing happened and asked me for help with her classes. 

Is there any way I can deal with this behavior?

Additional info about her:
	- Always attempts to use extremely large or outdated dictionary words in her texting vocabulary. Has never said one of them in a normal conversation
	- Breaks down and cries when she can''t overcome something simple as an ungraded homework problem.
	- Doesn't really understand big human problems. For example, we got a campus e-mail one time about how a rape was reported, where a girl was knocked unconscious in a school laboratory room and was raped, and she read it and laughed..

I'm a pretty nice person but I didn't know if this was enough to say that this girl is insane.

44,"hello friends, i should probably start this extensive question with a short backstory to better understand me or the relationship mentioned. i met this girl almost three years ago and we instantly hit it off, they felt like some unearthly entity that filled a void i've had since i lost my father five years ago. i was so grateful, we had everything in common, and it didn't take long for us to become almost obsessive with each other's company. i should add we live across the country, but that didn't prevent us from watching movies and tv shows literally every night that it was my routine. SHE became my routine. 

it didn't take me very long to notice the red flags, her behaviorisms (similar to an ex friend) and how she treated OTHER people, but there was absolutely no way she'd manipulate me as i saw her do outside our relationship. she has a few major mental issues (bpd, ptsd, alcohol addiction, suicidal) that became more evident as the months and years passed, when i was already more invested than i'd thought at the time. she went to rehab, twice, relapsing both times. she doesn't want to save herself, or seek salvage for her problems; i see her as someone who loves being miserable. i thought i could save her and be the reason she'd change but her intentions to deny every chance at a new life started to show. 

i knew at some point that i was already damaged when i couldn't go more than 10 minutes without talking to her. i'd cancel plans with real life friends just to give her my full attention, i even damages a five year long incredible friendship because my attention was 150% on her and just barely on the people who deserve me the most. i've lived in constant anxiety and something akin to fear because of her- but i NEEDED her and she had plenty of techniques to show me she needed me and kept me around quite well. i've been very self aware for a few years but have been so scared to envision waking up daily without her. i've forgotten how to be me without her and needed some way to regain sanity and stop existing at the expense of someone else's needs. 

needless to say, i sent her a long text yesterday morning after painful deliberation and blocked her on every social media. it's genuinely the most heart breaking feeling imagining her moving on, sharing our interests, favorite movies/shows and making someone else her priority. i believe i've been ""trained"" and i don't know how to break myself from stalking her twitter and shit just to see her reaction, or how to stop making her my life. 

what are your experiences? does the pain eventually fade? what are some tips or self love things i could do for myself to ease the process? i need me back to being me for myself and for the incredible people who have supported me through this whole traumatizing relationship because they should be the ones seeing 150% of what i can offer. i don't feel as if i will be myself again.

45,"To some extent I feel like I have been traumatized by medical professionals. I have a few experiences that I would like opinions on or if anyone has experienced the same thing.
Have you ever been lied to about your diagnosis? I point blank asked my psychiatrist senior year of college if he thought I had a personality disorder and he said of course not. Then a few years later, I get my medical records and had as early as my sophomore year a possible cluster c personality disorder. I feel so betrayed because he lied and I trusted him, plus I actually do have a right to my diagnosis. I feel like I can’t trust other medical professionals to tell me the truth even though I know it happened years ago and I should be over it. 
The second happened senior year of college, but with a therapist. How does this work? She said she didn’t have me sign papers to become a client so she could tell other people. I mean the appointment was about suicide, but she clearly didn’t think it was an emergency because she didn’t even call my psychiatrist and people only followed up several days later and she didn’t even tell all health professionals, one was some random person from Luther administration. Also, since she prefaced it with I am doing this because I didn’t have you sign the forms. It makes me skeptical of confidentiality and that I wouldn’t even want to make a complaint because it would share my business with people. And what happens if my therapist or doctor just decides to talk to my parents or something. 
Third, my psychologist told me she couldn’t see me anymore the day after I got out of the hospital. I went from place to place being told they couldn’t handle me and eventually ended up killing myself. She just abandoned me. I had been with her for years and feel like she should have at least offered to be my therapist for a little while longer while I looked for another one.
Fourth, this has to do with when I tried to kill myself. I overdosed on medication. Is it okay when I got to the psych ward that they strip-searched me with my door wide open into the milieu room? I feel like they took advantage of my vulnerable state and not being able to protest. I just had another bad experience with a psychiatrist and it kind of brought it all back, then I got stuck. I just can't seem to find closure in all this and want to know if what they did was right or wrong.",26Sep2017,2

50,"Sorry if you have trouble understanding this, I'm bad at describing my thoughts.

So, I'm a high school junior, soon 16. The last few years have been very tough for me. When I went to middle school, it felt like I had to face the real world... I felt like I had lost my place in the world, if I ever had one. I have been trying so hard to know myself, but I can't locate or identify my own thoughts. I have been reading posts in r/depression, r/asktransgender, r/aspergers, r/depression, r/bipolar, r/introverts and r/INTP, but I still feel lost. I know I have issues regarding at least one of these subjects. I just don't know which one(s).

What should I do? How can I get peace of mind? How can I find my path?",26Sep2017,3

52,"Hey. New account because I don’t want any friends seeing this. If I ever finish making this post instead of deleting it and restarting it yet again.

I could do with some advice. I’m trying to think of a way to articulate my problems here but I’ve been arguing with myself internally for years about them and have never managed to come to a clean, concise conclusion or definition of what exactly they are... so sorry if this is a bit of a messy thread.

I have some serious problems with motivation and confidence. I hate just about every aspect of myself and my life and I can’t stop comparing myself to all of my friends and peers and concluding myself to be inferior on every level. I’m too short, I’m too fat, I’m too ugly, I’m too slow, I’m too weak, I’m too stupid, I’m too ignorant, I’m too passive, I’m too annoying, I’m too unsociable, I’m too quiet...

Nothing I do is ever good enough and I’m too slow at doing it. I lose motivation to even try to do stuff because I just feel like it’s pointless, that I’m a broken record trying to accomplish something eternally beyond my grasp. Everything about my life seems constrained by my own self doubt and self loathing - but then both of them are so absolute that I have difficulty a lot of the time believing that I even have them, and that I’m not really just a totally inferior.. ‘thing’.

I just don’t know what to do. Should I try going to a doctor? I went to ask about having depression when I was 14 and was told I was just an attention seeking teenager and that my feelings were totally normal, so I’ve not felt too comfortable going to a doctor about any mental health stuff since then...

Sorry if this thread makes no sense. It makes no sense to me, god knows how little sense it just make to you..",26Sep2017,1
53,"Don’t know where to start but I felt like this was a good and safe space. My husband’s brother, 32 male, has a lack of empathy. If you can imagine, this affects many aspects of his life- short-term and long-term. My husband and his parents have been doing their best to deal with his behavior for many years. They have decided (my husband and his parents [my in-laws] decided that it’s time to finally take a step towards helping him with his issues.

From what I observe, he has no sense of personal responsibility (stemming from the lack of empathy). He graduated college and has never had a long-term job. My in-laws who are thousands of miles away say that they do not financially support him but here in Los Angeles, you can’t rent a room, pay for gas, cellphone, food, etc without any income or large sums of money stashed away. I’ve suggested to my husband that my in-laws maybe give him a deadline to get his affairs in order by a certain date (ie keep a part-time job so he can start to pay some of his bills on his own), but my husband is convinced that this is not the best way to deal with whatever condition/disorder he has. He is probably right (I don’t mean to say that in an insensitive manner). 

My husband (who is 2 years older) has observed since they were growing up that his brother did okay in social settings but often missed social cues and had trouble empathizing. He has a few friends but none are close. My husband has tried for many years to try to build a bond with him but nothing as seemed to work. 

For example, I got him a job interview and my friend who interviewed him was shocked by his aloofness. I was so embarrassed but taking a step back, my friend was understanding of the situation and most of all, it hurt me that he was not able to at least see some value in being interviewed. Again, it goes back to him just not caring about anyone’s feelings, the time my friend took, and most of all, not caring about himself.

He spends his day sleeping and is a self-proclaimed night owl. He does book freelance gigs here and there but otherwise, he is not volunteering or anything like that. I do not know if he abuses any drugs or alcohol but from the 7 years of knowing him, I do not suspect this, but I could be wrong.

My husband and in-laws are convinced that my BIL will not be open to talking to a therapist or counselor but I suggested that maybe we, as a family, without my BIL, initially, could talk to someone who could steer us in the right direction. Then hopefully we can bring him into fold to figure out a long-term solution. My in-laws are out-of-state but I’m certain there is a way for us to work on this at some capacity.

My in-laws are aging and it hurts to see my husband feel the weight of the responsibility for my BIL. In addition, I have another BIL (my husband’s other brother) who will need care for the rest of his life. Any suggestions would be helpful. ",26Sep2017,1

I've been taking it for... I want to say... a month now?

Within the past week I've noticed my taste perception MULTIPLY. I wanted pizza and ate a piece and it literally tasted like heaven. It tasted like I was high. 

It's happened a few times since then with random foods. Flavors are SO intense and godly.
