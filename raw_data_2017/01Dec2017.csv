1,"I'm an 18 F.  I have never had treatment for mental illness.  I don't know if this is the right place but I'm so tired. I had panic attacks when I was younger, and have always been a very anxious person, especially in social situations.  I was able to deal with this though.  I moved to college earlier this year, and have been in a downward spiral.  It seems stupid to say when I am having more experiences then ever before in my life that I am doing so bad mentally.  I'm constantly tired.  I'll want to go to bed at 5pm, stay up till 11pm, Sleep till 10am, get up for an hour, and then take a nap.  And even when I'm awake, I'm constantly tired and all I want to do is lay down.  I'm also super anxious, even though I'm constantly tired.  I am not suicidal, but I keep thinking how nice it would be to not have to be, liking fantasying about going to jail or getting severely injured or a terminal illness (obviously I know this is stupid and untrue, but it doesn't feel like that) I'm avoiding all my school responsibilities, waiting for the absolute last minute, and wasting my time watching Netflix or sleeping. I won't stop eating.  I eat even though I don't enjoy it and feel sick, but I keep shoving food down my throat.  I haven't told anyone I feel like this.  I don't have anyone I'm close enough to trust without disappointing them.

I'm sick of being like this.  How do I not be like this.",01Dec2017,2,
2,"Here I am at 23. I have good friends, good family, good job, etc. but am definitely not normal. I am not real with anyone in my life every aspect has a different face I put on. I dont talk to coworkers, classmates, or roommates. Any time attention is on me I blush. Never had a girlfriend, despite kinda trying for a few months (meeting up and just hooking up with ppl via tinder/bars even so I have a lot of difficulty doing this due to not knowing how) but just dont really have the desire its just me trying to be normal. Been dealing with terrible social anxiety and depression my whole life. 




Lately been doing a lot of introspection trying to figure out where this stemmed from besides a family history of mental health. I have ended up pinpointed one aspect of my life that unknowingly has had a important affect...being forced to sit alone at an allergy table throughout elementary school. This along with all the other side effects of having a deadly food allergy in a world where it was a new concept probably created a me vs them mentally and hindered social behavior. Sometimes I think I may have aspergers/austim cause of my inability to get over social issues and being unable to connect with most people.

3,"I'm usually a really funny, happy kid, but lately i haven't felt like me. In like the past 3 or 4 days i have been my normal self and then randomly in bursts between 1-4 hours i feel this dark cloud come over me. I feel this indescribable sadness and my mind races at times until i get a headache, other times I just feel 
down and i have no clue why. Whenever i try to be happy during these times i literally cant no matter how i try, my chest just feels like its sinking and i cant do anything about it. At times during these 1-4 hours i have lots of suicidal thoughts or thoughts of doing hardcore drugs to sooth myself or OD. Then when
I think about why I'm having these thoughts i literally cant find a reason why. I just want to sleep all the time too. As soon as the 1-4 hours ends I feel like a giant weight has just been lifted or some sort of being just left my body, but afterwards I'm still fucked up about what just happened. I don't really feel the need to tell others because they either wont understand, wont believe me, or take it as some sort of joke. I'm just wondering if this is depression, anxiety, or some sort of weird mental illness. Don't really know much about that stuff so I'm just wondering what is wrong with me.",01Dec2017,2,
4,"I know I could go on and on, but I want to keep this as brief and coherent as possible.

 Quick background: I have a few co-occurring disorders. I have a great therapist, a great psychiatrist, my current medications are helping, but more importantly, I’ve been putting in the work outside of my appointments and not depending on the medication to fix everything for me. 

  Now that I’ve been better able to deal with common anxiety-inducing problems like negative thought loops, I find that the anxiety has moved out of my conscious mind and into the unconscious.
 
  The manifestation I’m currently struggling with is what I now recognize as agoraphobia. I hit these obstacles getting out the door. No matter how much I prepare, no matter how early I wake up, *even if it's something I'm really excited for and want to do*, I'm either always running late or not leaving at all. 

  It's like I get *stuck* to something or somethings. Even as I tell myself, **""You don't need to do this right now, this isn't important,""** I can't physically stop myself from this overwhelming demand to, say, find a satisfactory pair of white socks to wear or start organizing my countertop or check the weather again, and again, and from another website to see if I really need to wear a raincoat or not, or check that the burners are off (even if I didn't use the stovetop) or determine whether or not I can trust the timer outlet to keep the space heater off while I'm out... Always trivial and unnecessary, but a very major barrier that's grown increasingly detrimental.

It’s a daily struggle, but it has gotten so serious-I’ve taken almost three hours on typing this when I *need* to go to the grocery store, and take out my overflowing trash and recycling. I’ve been telling myself to stop and just GO, but I’m stuck.

I've used all these skills and tools and tricks, and I don't know why I can't overcome this. ",01Dec2017,2,
5,"Hello, I'm 21, F, from Texas. (If you're interested -- I am -- I am a Capricorn Rising with a Leo Moon, which are you?) 
I have been thus far able to control the way I exhibit my emotions. Lately, however, I have been feeling very out of control. I move from excited/excitable to depressive/frustrated/angry and back constantly. I want to say that I would rather feel numb, but I don't know a sane person who would rather feel nothing. I feel literally every emotion at the same time, and whichever feeling gets triggered by an outside force is the one that presents itself (is what it feels like to me). I guess I want to know if someone else feels like this too? I'm sure someone does. But candidly? How can you cope with this heart-on-your-sleeve state of being?

6,"First off, I posted about running out of anti-depressents yesterday.... Appearently I had another refill that I completely forgot about, so everything is fine now. 


I don't think they're working though. In Stranger Things season 2 Will said something along the lines of ""It doesn't feel like I'm awake, but I know I'm awake"". That's how I feel right now. Its like there's a ""mist"" separating my feelings/emotions from the rest of my brain. I don't know how to describe it but imagine being tired 24/7 and not having any emotions at all.  


Has anybody else experienced this before? ",01Dec2017,2,
7,"This fall started with me and my girlfriend breaking up. She was my first real love and was the first person who really loved the whole me for who I am and I loved her for everything about her. It ended lovingly and mutually because we realized that we weren't happy individually with our own lives. We both relied on each for happiness and when both of us were having a hard time in our lives (I was having a hard time getting a job and she was dealing with a lot of stress and negitivity at school) on top of being long distance, it was too much. She is still on my mind everyday after two months and all I want is to see her and just talk, not expecting to get back together. Just want her in my life, but she can't handle that without wanting to get back together so has shut me out completely.

Then a month later I lost my grandmother, an amazing woman. Which was very hard but I knew I did everything I could to see her before and show her that we all loved her. It is still hard and I still think of her consistantly

Then 2 weeks later my grandfather on the other side died unexpectedly. I was physically a lot closer to him and visited him but not enough and feel so guilty about it. I miss him so much, he was the grandparent I was closest to and try to hold on to a few of his last words, ""I'm so proud of you"". This was after him finding out I got a job.

At home I am really close with my dad because we are basically the same person, but it never gets really emotional. We will talk about everything but there is no big hug. Maybe Ill ask for that. With my mom she just connects everything to god, talking about weird nonsensicalls or randomly praying. Being a closet atheist this only makes me feel worse.

Now I'm moving to Syracuse for my new job and I'm scared. I feel alone at home and that is with my parents surrounding me and I'm scared of feeling more alone in a city where I only know 1-2 people. I miss my Ex more than I have ever missed anyone, I am sad about my grandparents. I'm excited for my job but it feels kinda empty which scares me. Hopefully it gets better when I start, but maybe writing some of my feelings out helps too.  ",01Dec2017,4,
8,"Hi. I am 23 year old male who haven't had any mental illnesses in the past, but lately i don't know what's wrong with me. To give you a better context, i'll start of with this:

Back when me and my current girlfriend were in the early flirting stages, i was talking to some other girls too. Some other things happened like me and my ex had sex while in those stages with my current gf. In August, we started talking about commitment but i haven't seen her yet since she's 6 hours away from me. We exchanged i love you's and while at that stage, i invited my ex wanting something to happen. Nothing happened but we kissed. I didn't tell her any of thay since i haven't seen her. Fast forward 3 months and we were both so in love and made my arrangements to come and visit her but suddenly, i got this unbelievable urge to tell her everything. I got guilty eventually spilled the beans. She couldnt handle it, she said she'd think about giving me another chance but then this is where it gets weird for me. Everytime I think about something bad i've done in the past, like steal a candy bar and got caught, sent and asked for nudes even though i hqven't met her at that time, and so many things, i get this unbelievable urge to tell her. I don't know what is wrong with me. I don't want to tell her all of those things but if I don't, I get so guilty and anxious that I can't eat and have this unbelievable numbness in my hands and face. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been thinking non stop. I even told her about the time when me and my ex filmed one of our sexual encounters which she didn't need to find out because it would disgust her. Everytime I talk to her, too, I would get this lump in my chest idk what it's about. And when i end up saying something i normally wouldn't. I want to have a shot at fixing this but i can't evem fix myself. I can't act normal when we're talking because the anxieties will take over. Please I really wish i can get help from here or at least i can find out what's happening.",01Dec2017,1,

11,"I've gone to 4 sessions now and on my first one I was told to purchase a book, ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"" and every appointment afterwards after I talk for an hour she's basically told me ""keep with the book"" when I ask her what I should do. And we haven't discussed any other coping mechanisms in the meantime. I'm frustrated and I feel like I'm wasting money. Should I just stop seeing her and read this book until I fix myself with no help from anyone else?",01Dec2017,2,
12,"I'm a 35 yr old male, who suffered a pretty significant head injury as a teenager (8' fall, knocked me out and started convulsions, eyes rolling in my head, etc). Nothing was ever diagnosed...because I never saw a doctor. In fact, after regaining consciousness I spent the next 2 hours playing kickball and eating pizza (which I don't remember) then drove myself home (also don't remember). 

Having said all of that, maybe it has nothing to do with my current situation. More recently I find myself forgetting, a lot. And not just small stuff. For example, I spent 3 months learning to play a song on the piano. Last week I played and sang it in church. Yesterday I sat down to play it again, and I can't get past the first line. I spent almost 30 minutes trying to remember how to play it, with no success.
Also, I'm a minister. I spend 10-15 hours each week preparing my sermon. Within 3-4 days of delivering it, I usually can't tell you what I had spoken about. Sometimes I'll be driving and I can't remember where I am. Usually after 5 or 10 minutes it will come back to me. Sometimes I just keep driving until I find a place I recognize.

Like I said, I'm aware that some of what I perceive to be put downs or mistreatment are just misperceptions on my part, but a lot of it isn't.

That, and my constant memories of self inflicted embarrassment (some ancient and some fresh) constantly telling me what a stupid fool I am and how it's pointless to try and carry myself confidently because of what a bumbling, absent minded, easily flustered jackass I am.

15,"So i’ve experienced therapy in all kinds of forms. I’ve been an impatient in a psychiatric hospital, outpatient at a psychiatric hospital at varying levels, i went to a temporary therapeutic school, and i’ve done weekly/monthly meetings with a therapist. i’ve done both private and group therapy. All i’ve never really found that helpful. I’ve had straight up bad therapists who have disclosed my information to people they should not have and therapists i thought just didn’t get me anywhere. i feel like we never dive deep into the root of my problems it’s always just dealing with surface level stuff and talking about coping mechanisms. i don’t know if i’ve just had bad therapists?

i also feel like i don’t really know what to talk to in therapy like my thoughts are everywhere and i don’t where to start or i forget about what’s bothering me. sometimes i even feel stupid talking about my problems 

anyone feel like this too?

Well, I did. I admitted to myself I have a problem in my head going on, and I need therapy. I enrolled myself thank fucking GOD and my first appointment is on Wednesday. I’ve spoken to two people since i left, very briefly, and always returned back to my non-existent state. 

Things I’ve learned so far: You can process and think about a fair amount of information without the daily distractions of text text text text text gotta Facebook lemme tweet this. It’s liberating, and I feel very little distractions. 

I’ve learned who truly gives a fuck about me. Not the people I hang out with. That’s the most important thing. The people I consider my friends, who I spend most of my time with, have made no attempt to contact me during this entire ordeal. But two of the people Im pretty close with but don’t hang out, literally messaged my mother asking what’s going on. Those are the people I’m going to hang on to the most. The others, I’m leaving them in the dust.

19,"My family (wife &amp; sons) tell daily me that I am being passive aggressive and mean to them and that I don’t love them.  I really don’t understand what it is I am (or not) doing and am often dumbfounded when they tell me this.

Tonight I wanted to know if I could take the car in for service tomorrow.  I asked “do you need the car tomorrow?”.  And then when asked why I said “I’d like to get the car serviced if you’re not using it”.  At this point I was told I was being passive aggressive.  I wasn’t trying to start anything and sincerely just wanted to know if it was ok to take the car in.  They also said that my tone, expression, and body language was aggressive despite me not feeling anger or frustration at the time.

Another common example is when my wife is having a difficult time with a task and I offer to help.  She will get upset and yell that she would have asked me for help if she wanted it and that I am treating her like an idiot who can’t think for herself and In doing so I am being passive aggressive.  I am sincerely trying to be helpful.  When this happens, I will usually remain outwardly calm and not raise my voice though I may start to get inwardly frustrated over the confusion and accusations.  I do try hard not to offer help anymore but it is my instinct and I still often do by mistake.  It’s hard because at other times she will be upset with me for not offering help, causing me confusion.

I do often ‘walk on broken glass’ when I am at home.  They can tell when I am doing this and they tell me it is also passive aggressive. It’s just that I feel like I can never do anything right around my family.  This may be because I am often told that I am not doing something correctly.  I don’t deny that I sometimes screw things up but sometimes it about something as trivial as taking a different route to a store then they think I should.  
I’m really confused when they get so upset with me over such things which in turn upsets them even more.

They tell me that they don’t believe I love them anymore.  I understand because I do tend to take them for granted.  Regardless,I do love them more than anything and would sacrifice all for them and tell them as much.  When I do try to show my love it either doesn’t come across right or is not enough.  In my heart I know they love me but I generally have a hard time believing it.  

I often think they would be better off without me and have told them so.  I love them and don’t want to hurt them anymore but I don’t know how to stop because I’m always surprised when told that I’ve done something mean.

It may be worth noting that I do very well at work and have none of these issues there.   However, I no longer have any close friends due to the strain they had caused my marriage over the years.  I let go of all my old friends long ago and avoid making new ones so as not to upset my wife.  You might say I’ve put up a wall.

22,"So today I met with the psychiatrist I have been doing tests with. At first I was fearful that I would come out of there none the different with no direction but in the end it went mostly how I had been hoping with a few added things.

Well either way she says that yes, I do have ADHD and will need stronger meds than what I have been taking in order to cope.  This is what I had been thinking and what I wanted to hear.  Now maybe finally I can go through life as a normal person. That's all I want.

ALSO she added on that I am showing signs of moderate to severe depression and anxiety. That much I already knew, and my roommate was like, ""I could have told you that about the anxiety."" lol :P Either way, I'm hoping that with my ADHD symptoms under control my depression and anxiety will be better.

But the psychiatrist also added, and this wasn't something I had been anticipating because I never really knew what it was (despite having heard the term before) is that while there isn't enough for a full diagnoses, I do have symptoms of borderline personality disorder.  When she said that I was like, ""Okay I've heard of it but what exactly IS it?""

She explained the bits of it to me that she said I was displaying symptoms of, and upon further research I would say that yes, I do relate to some of that is listed.  Here's a link if anyone is curious.  I don't want to type it all out haha. Either way she wants me to seek out therapy and a specific type of treatment known as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I've never heard of it before but I guess it's supposed to help train me to have better relationships with people or something? IDK whatever works I guess. She said that this kind of stuff could be genetic but also can be caused by stuff that happened in my childhood and/or the way I was raised. 

Either way, I have better medication and treatment coming my way.  I almost feel really angry at the years wasted because no one else caught on to this.  How might my life be different if I had been told all of this years ago? Especially since I had a neuro-psych eval about ten years ago and the dude didn't seem to give a shit and never explained any of the results to me or anything. I had no idea what to do.

25,"Before I start this vent/ramble I would like to say first that I'm not in any meds or been to any therapy. 

Since 3rd grade I've always wanted to just disappear or die. I'll get a massive wave of depression after a week or two of thinking I'm finally fine. I always kinda knew what death was so I was fine with just dying off anytime, until now. Whenever I think about what's after death I'll start to get this panic and realization that there won't be anything after death, I won't be able to see any of my favorite series or shows, it'll just be a black void. This cycle repeats once or twice a month. 

Until I was around eight my mother would touch me whenever I asked for something, even for $5 for a school lunch. She had a affair with a coworker, she would sometimes bring me over to his house. Sometimes i would walk into the room that they were in because I was lonely, they would usually be touching each other saying that it was a massage and told me to go watch the tv. I never knew this man's name, only a nickname I was told to call him by. They said if I told my dad, he would kill the man my mother was having a affair with as a threat, I never truly bought into it. I wish I told my dad so they would get a divorce. My mother always yell at the simplest things and complains about no one helping her out yet she will disappear 12-30 hours about every other day. I just wished she would die, sometimes I get the urge to help and speed up the inevitable...this isn't really about mental health anymore 

I guess continuing on what I last said, my school has a large staircase once in a while I wonder what would happen if I pushed someone down from the top. No one would remember me as the person who did it, I don't have any friends there, and people often forget who I am. 

Sometimes when I'm home alone, walking down a hallway, or trying to sleep I'll see a shadowy figure out of the corner of my eye. When I turn to look it's gone. I'll also sometimes hear someone speaking but when I look for who said it there's no one home. 

I haven't been eating as much as I should. If I try to eat enough food in one sitting so I won't get hungry throughout the day my dad will just call me a glutton. He'all sometimes demand I save him half of what I'm eating, even if I told him I haven't ate anything for 17+ hours. I've just been forgetting to eat and I'm also dehydrated. 

Sorry for this ramble, I don't even know if it belongs to this sub...

28,"Are certain kinds of therapies best for certain kinds of issues than others? More specifically, is a particular type of therapy recommended to help with issues related to empathy? I wouldn't even call it an issue, it usually doesn't hinder my daily life at all - it's just that sometimes people tell me that I have trouble relating to them and I don't really know how to make someone feel better if they're upset (even someone close, like my partner). Or sometimes something bad will happen in the news and people around me will be upset about it; I try to act appropriately too but sometimes have trouble understanding why it's a big deal. 

(To clarify I definitely don't think I'm a psychopath or anything like that - I do have emotions, especially for animals; sometimes I just have trouble relating to people and when I try it kind of feels dull, or like moving slowly underwater, or trying to remember a dream but the more you try the more difficult it becomes.)

So I would like to talk to someone to see how I can improve with that and get some idea of whether this is just normal, and everyone is like this but just doesn't talk about it. I am in an EU country where the native language is not English. It can apparently be a little difficult to find English speaking therapists here, but it is possible and there are therapy listings in many different categories. I have seen listings here for cognitive behavioural therapy, emotionally focused therapy, regression therapy, etc. I am not sure what kind of therapy might suit best with this kind of topic and don't really have the money to try them *all*. I'd appreciate any recommendations of where to start.

31,"It all started with an eating disorder when I was 18. I had went from a size 2 to a size 8 and my family called me a fat pig and said I wasn't beautiful anymore. In order to try to cope with it, I would judge everyone who weighed more than me. I would look at them and think terrible things, wondering why they haven't killed themselves yet. The next few years, my mental illness deteriorated significantly: bipolar type II disorder, binge eating, adderall abuse, PTSD from family emotional abuse, molestation (not family), and rape. My family judges everyone and my mother is a narcissist.

Years later, I am successful on the outside and mentally strong for coping, starting my own business, and getting straight A's in school (genetically smart). But there's a price, and that price is comparing myself to everyone to feel like I don't deserve to die.

I'm considered conventionally very attractive. I judge and insult (in my head) everyone's looks, clothes, everything, because I have to maintain perfection so I don't deserve to die and they do. I'm in my 20's. Once I leave my prime, I know I have to kill myself because I won't be able to compete anymore.

I have to prove my family wrong and be the thinnest, most beautiful and richest among them. I hate them (for good reason) and just want all but one loving family member out of my life.

I have to be more successful than my rapists. They're mostly deadbeats, so that won't be an issue, but I need to make more money than at least 3 of them combined. If I don't get to 100k in a few years, I'll be a failure.

I gained five pounds. I have to believe everyone is weak when they weigh more than me, so now I feel weak and my world is crumbling.

I'm smart. I'm doing graduate level work with an undergrad degree and emotionally intelligent. But to feel good about that, I have to label everyone else as stupid - again, so I'm not a waste of space.

I love my friends and long-term boyfriend; they're actually exempt from my criticism and competitiveness. I feel secure around them. Everyone I meet, I hate and judge automatically.

As for the narcissistic family: I'm the black sheep because I didn't live up to their conservative values and rebelled as a teenager: sex, drugs, stealing. I was insulted and degraded and they arrested me and tried to sue me. I turned to prostitution to try to make enough money to run away and they slut shamed me and said they didn't believe it because I wouldn't make that much money.

I got raped last year. I told my family. My only kind family member thinks about it all the time and is there for me. My sisters and mother said ""that's terrible"" and then changed the topic to themselves and never brought it up again. I told my family I was molested all the time as a child and that I would rather sleep over at my rapist's house than come home to their insults. They said ""nobody asked you to do that"" and ""I thought it was only one guy"" and that they don't know why I didn't tell them, because all they ever did was love me and I pushed them away and am mentally ill.

My mother is constantly berating me because she thinks I don't love her, because I'm vain and obsessed with my looks, because I'm selfish. Whenever I talk to them about it, I'm blamed for being a brain washed liberal, delusional, selfish. My mother once said I should be down on my knees begging for her forgiveness for what happened when I was a teenager. They now refer to those years as the time I went crazy and say they've forgiven me. They say I live in the past and hold a grudge. My mother blames my boyfriend for not talking to them, saying he doesn't care about family and maybe he's not that serious about me (we've been together 7 years).

Not sure where to start but will try.

I just created a reddit account, a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Daily-Depressed-1581276658607538) account and a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/DailyDepressed) account in order to try a recovery. Maybe it's worth it, maybe not but honestly have nothing to loose anyways so why not?

Why have I created all that above?
I want to get better and this is the way I found to give a first step and ask for help.
I lost my job a couple months ago and I and struggling with money and have no idea how to turn it around so thought that I could give something back and maybe someone would help me mentally and financially. I know it is a lot to ask but if you can I really appreciate it. 

**All I am asking of you is to like my page and if you feel like you can, be a patron.**

33,"Just discovered you guys, so I'm sorry if this is in the wrong place.

I've had chronic depression almost my whole life: it runs in the family and my mom's manifested in her over control of her kids in the fundamentalist Christian style. 

I used to NEVER have trouble sleeping but when I got pregnant for the first time about 3 years ago, I started getting insomnia and it just hasn't gone away. My theory is that there's something I'm hiding from and don't want to acknowledge and am afraid to relax and slip into sleep ever since pregnancy ramped me up

Does anyone have any advice?",01Dec2017,2,
34,"This could just be hormones, as I’m only 15. That being said, I have professionally diagnosed depression, and anxiety. I’ve noticed that over these past few months, I’ve started noticing less and less emotions, to the point where people have pointed it out to me. I think it could be mild sociopathy/psychopathy but I don’t want to self diagnose. If anyone knows what this could be please let me know, I’m happy to answer any questions people have",01Dec2017,1,
35,"Ever since I was a baby, my parents remember putting me to bed and that I'd only sleep for 5-20 minutes then wake up as if I'd slept for 5 hours. 

Sometimes, I'll be asleep but then something weird happens. I probably sound crazy, but I visit other worlds/dimensions. A lot of the time these dimensions are very similar to the regular world, but with some differences. It does not happen every night, more like every week or so. It happened again last night and there was this world where there were gargantuan tornado-like things in the sky, but unlike a regular tornado, these were over 30,000 feet in height and there were a few high altitude clouds in the sky. The tornadoes were white and moving extremely slowly, and also hour glass shaped. I felt the breeze in my face and I wasn't imagining it because when I imagine things, they're vague and I know I'm just imagining them. I was right there. 

I remember feeling a little freaked out since there were 5 or so of these tornadoes in the sky/distance, but everyone there acted like it was completely normal. 

A lot of the time these travels scare me because on some occasions I've gotten hurt and I worry about getting seriously hurt or maybe killed if I travel into the wrong realm for example what if I go into a realm/dimension where it's constantly minus ninety degrees? That kind of stuff. I'd be dead and my parents would wonder why I suddenly went missing or died. I have little control over what place I end up. I once entered a dimension where the characters I made up were real people and I interacted with them. 

I eventually come back to this world, time has quickly passed by and I'm in a daze. I always feel really anxious and paranoid as I'm 'crossing over' like someone or something is watching me. I end up going about my day but I feel mentally drained, like these travels are draining on my psyche. 

Interestingly, I do not have these travels when I use something to make me unconscious which is evidence this ability requires me to be conscious to some extent. When I am sleeping under anesthesia for example, I don't travel I just remain asleep.

My family and other people who know me comment that I always seem tired and I feel like I don't actually sleep so I try to rest but it's in vain.  ",01Dec2017,2,

41,"I'll try to make a very long story short. 

Dad comes from a family with lots of physical abuse. His father could snap and beat up his mom, break everything in their house. My grandma (dad's mom) was admitted to a pyschiatric ward because of the abuse and never came out. 

Dad married, and got a boy. Did the same thing as his dad did. Dad cheated on wife with my mom. Again, does the same. 

I'll try to describe it: He'll be fine for months, but then suddenly, he just SNAPS at nothing. For example, yesterday he was dropping me off at the bus station, and the radio was really loud, and while I was taking my bag, he shouted 'TEXT ME WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG!' and I said 'you don't have to shout', and he snapped. Told me I wasn't allowed home anymore. Whenever he gets an 'attack' (let call it like that) he breaths really deep and much more than usual.
When I was 6, I remember there was also something I said he didn't like (probably something minor I mean, I was 6) and I had to carry the bag of potatoes all the way up the stairs while he was kicking me up the stairs. 
When he found out my mom cheated on my he beated her SOOO badly. She had bruises and bled everyday. 
He says that whenever he founds outs he's ill, he's going to kill her and then commit suicide. (not a nice thing to listen to as a 20 year old (yes btw, I'm 20 yo)

Second part: he doesn't have any friends. Like NONE. He doesn't want any, because 'you can't trust anyone' and he also thinks 'everyone is against him'. My mom also wasn't allowed to have any friends. He also doesn't have any hobbies. The only thing he does is sit on his computer the whole day. His loves stalking people on Facebook. His does it with al my friends' parents for example and all our neighbors. He looks them up on the internet, even their tax revenues! 
The only thing he's really interested in, is money.

By writing this he seems like a bad person, which he's NOT. He does everything for me but still, I don't understand what it is.

Our GP has referred him to a psychiatrist, but he doesn't want to go. 

Does someone recognize this?",01Dec2017,1,

I myself have experienced bad service.

I am just wondering since i wanted to get some therapy later on in my life but i am too scared to get some.

In my case when i looked for help it always ended up badly. I usually got bad recommendations or sent to a rehab clinic.

My therapist was a faker i noticed it. everytime i said something she kept saying ""i know right"" and only seem to give a fuck to unusual stuff i said.

Me and my sister were taken to morocco by our mom she took us without even informing our Dad who lived with us. Me and my sister stayed there for 5 years and we were manipulated our whole time there I was 5 and my sister was 8 when we first got there. My mom is schizophrenic and took her insecurities out on me and my sister. Most of my abuse was because of school. My mom would always call me stupid and beat the shit out of me for being stupid and with my sister she would beat her up because she was chubby. I had a cousin there who tortured me constantly my breaking my stuff beating me up and sexually molesting me by touching me and making me do certain things the abuse persisted everyday. 5 years later my sister stole my moms phone and contacted my dad told him everything that happened and he brought us back to the us and got into a big fight with my mom. I was 10 and my sister was 13 When we came back it was very hard for me and my sister to cope with it because that pain felt like home so my sister started starving herself and but then formed bulimia after and I started self harming... my sister was sent to multiple treatment centers for eating disorders and I aswell for self harm
When I was 15 I got into a big argument with my father and ran away with some bad people. I ended up wanting to numb the pain by buying xanax but ended up getting raped. I’m still fighting to put him in jail. I dropped out of school because I was constantly telling myself I was stupid and couldn’t do it. My mom put those words in my head. But I started working at jack in the box and I met an older guy. I was 16 when I met him and he was 28 we worked together. We hungout a lot and started dating at the time I thought he was into me but now I see it as manipulation because he wouldn’t want to do anything but sleep around we did sleep around for months until I got tired of it and told him I just wanted to talk... well he ended up raping me. I eventually filed a report. I’m 17 now and I’m constantly on the lookout for anything that’s going to harm me. I can’t keep relationships with people because at the end of the day my thoughts win and I perceive they are out to get me just like everyone in my past was. I’m consumed with shame and fear I sometimes have to go to the emergency room for my anxiety cause I can’t breath and don’t even start with the flashbacks. Hell im lucky if I can control them because most of the time I can’t and it sucks it really does to feel like you’re whole life is ruined because of your past",01Dec2017,4,
49,"I (female) have always been quite insecure about my looks. It got pretty bad when I was 14-18 but I feel like I've made some improvement about coming to terms with how I look. (I'm now 20)

Last year, when I was having one of my bouts of insecurity about my looks, I asked one of my closest friends about how she honestly thought I looked and she told that I looked ""above average but there are definitely much prettier girls out there"". I know she didn't say that out of malice and she's just very blunt and honest. 

Now I know that I'm not ugly and I should feel thankful for not feeling ugly but for some reason, being average or above average isn't good enough for me. I just really want to be considered pretty by the majority of people. I know this sounds extremely shallow and I'm aware some people may think worse of me for saying this in my post, but I never voice these thoughts out, and I don't know why I've always thought like this I just have. I constantly compare myself to these beautiful and gorgeous girls on instagram and youtube with lots of followers and I just really really really wish I could be pretty enough for people to follow me based on my looks.

Ever since she's said that to me, it has always in the back of my mind like whenever I look in the mirror or when I do make up. On the days that I feel that I look decent (e.g. when my skin looks good or i did my makeup nicely or I take a nice photo), I'll remember what she said and I start feeling so stupid for even trying because I'll never be pretty enough. I recently got a septum piercing and I thought I looked really good with it and I have received compliments from my friends, I've started feeling really stupid about getting it, like I'm not pretty enough to even pull this off. I appreciate the compliments my friends and boyfriend gives me but I honestly can't seem to help but feel like they are just being nice. And there are just days when I just look at myself in the mirror or at a horrible photo and just looking at my face makes me tear up and I start overanalyzing my face and their imperfections. I feel like her comment has really affected me, but I don't think I could ever tell her that because I know she didn't mean it in a bad way.

I've recently found out about BDD but I'm not sure whether I actually do have it but I am aware that I do exhibit some symptoms of it. and I've been thinking about seeking professional help to get an actual diagnosis along with other things that have been affecting my life. 

In the meantime, I would really like some help with how I should go about at least trying to control these thoughts because I'm starting to feel like I'm starting to feel like how I was back when my self esteem was at its lowest. 

Thank you

50,"I'm 20 and currently living with psychologically abusive family, leaving me in this hyper-depression and I'm now mentally unstable asf. Also not over a breakup that happened 7 months ago (or a year ago, depending on how ""technical"" you want to be if you knew our full story. but i'm not gonna get into that), and I honestly think that that's what makes the family issue more potent. It's those two things that are causing all of my issues. 

I've also been unemployed for a while, but I have a new job I am starting soon (it was supposed to have started already, but was rescheduled). But since I HAVE been unemployed, it has given me too much time to think, stress, worry, overanalyze. I'm a CHRONIC overanalyzer and my guy friend (who I'll talk about in a second) even says I am a control freak. (Which freaks me out, but I appreciate his honesty. He doesn't say it in a mean or degrading way, he's just casually mentioned it a couple times)


So, my ex was a good person. A SUPER good person. Let's call him T. Every day of my life I wonder if I made the right choice leaving T (T was my first relationship EVER). But sometimes, I wonder if T was mentally abusive. Or if I was. Or if we both were to each other. Since I KNOW for a FACT that my family DEFINITELY IS mentally abusive, I'm starting to worry that either: 1.) All I know from my family is mental abuse, so I will be a target and that is all I will accept, unknowingly (yet if I knew better, I'd make sure I was in a healthy relationship, but I'll never know) OR 2.) It will be me. [I] will be the mentally abusive one, towards other people. And I don't want that. But it's all I know from my family. 

So T may or may not himself be mentally abusive. He could have had the best of intentions for me, and honestly I think he did. But I'm starting to get paranoid. I'm starting to notice a pattern with him. Ever since the break up, we would talk on and off. We both never wanted to leave each others side, and we still don't. We would always contact each other no matter what, or no matter how much I've said ""we need to stop talking, it's only going to hurt both of us in the longrun"". We're just addicted to each other. But the fishy pattern I notice in him are this: (AND BEFORE YOU GUYS JUDGE HIM OR TALK SHIT ABOUT HIM, YOU NEED TO READ THE NEXT INDENT THAT WILL BE COMING, OKAY, PLEASEEEEE!!!!!) 1.) He will SAY he loves me, SAY he fights for what he loves, but then only fight through words. Calls, texts, and words. No action. By now, I know you guys are already judging him, but PLEASE keep an open mind and read down to the next indent!!! 2.) It seems as if he doesn't know me. DON'T JUDGE HIM YET. HE HAS SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS. It seems as if he doesn't know anything about my personality. It's so hurtful. We just can't emotionally bond for shit. I want passion and depth- he can't give me that. 3.) I remember him saying when we were together (on multiple occasions) that ""he's done playing with people's minds"" - I looked over this because I DO believe in coincidence, and I DO believe in self-betterment. But honestly this is such a big red flag, because I'm not dumb, and I know that one of the ""keys"" to fucking with somebody's mind is to convince them that you 'quit' doing it.. he also tells me that [I] fuck with his mind a lot, and in a way I guess I do because I know that I should not be texting him knowing damn well we're not over each other and it's only gonna stop us from getting over each other... but it's not like what I say to him isn't genuine. It's random. It's mean a lot. But it's genuine. And I always apologize if I feel I've gone too far. I apologize so much to him, and admit my wrongs, but he acts like I don't (remember, he doesn't know me...) Basically we're in a circle or hurting each other, and he doesn't even realize he's hurting me. He'll throw it in my face that he was loyal, and I KNOW he was- it's not that that's hurting me. It's the lack of reciprocation of effort. It won't get through his skull. He acts like he thinks that I think that he's a cheater, which I know he is not.

Oh, here's the indent I was talking about: So, you guys may judge me or think I'm weird for this. Boo hoo, how rude can you be? I see something in him so don't judge me for this: I think he may be a tad mentally slow. Like, he can function, but also just doesn't seem completely there. He's not mentally slow to the point that it would be morally wrong to date him- buuut he does seem pretty slow. I didn't even want to admit it to myself until my best friend met him and mentioned it (not rudely btw). Because of this, I cut him HUGE slack. I think he GENUINELY does not understand a lot of things, and I can not fault him for it. I feel really bad for letting it get to me, too, because I feel like I needed to be a good girlfriend and BUILD HIM UP, and not let that little shit get in the way. I feel replaceable, because I could not help him through his struggle the way I GENUINELY WANTED TO, because at the end of the day I had to look after my own mental health, which has me questioning reality. If we weren't long distance (AKA short distance, but when one or both of you are broke it feels like long distance) I would have given that relationship more in-person TLC, so the circumstances were out of my control. I tried to communicate with him SO HARD over the phone and text (and facetimes, when he answered) about how I want us both to be successful and happy, and wanted to take rational steps to having a future together. But he didn't seem to stay on the subject, AND BEFORE YOU JUDGE HIM OR ME, AND SAY THAT ""I'M DESPERATE AND HE MUST NOT WANT ME, REMEMBER WHAT I PREVIOUSLY SAID::::: I think it probably could have been because of either his short term memory loss, or his mental slowness, or both. He just couldn't say focused if it had to do with something serious, and I think it's genuinely because he genuinely didn't know a lot of stuff, genuinely didn't know what all the world had to offer (he DOES live in a hood, and is stuck in a loop of catering to his fake friends who use him. shit is sad, it really gets to me.) It hurts seeing him put them as priority over me, but he genuinely doesn't see the way they really are, and when he does, he questions it, and ends up running back to those people, because he has too much faith in humanity. I swear to GOD, he is my male version, and I'm tearinh up writing this now, because I just want to see him do better, and be treated right, but I feel hypocritical because I'm also not treating him right, I AM, but I'm not- I try to help him think a litter straighter, but I could be doing it in a nicer way. I think the reason I don't is because his brother told me that the best way to get through to his head is to hurt his feelings, so I guess I've grown addicted to doing that, and kind of take advantage of the fact that he lets me treat him any ol way, but I DO CARE about him. I'm just SO DESPERATE to see him do good, even if that means hurting his feelings into talking sense into him. 

Anyways. With all the hellofaloo with my ex, ON TOP OF living with my mentally abusive family, I'm starting to worry I may living in a world SURROUNDED, just SURROUNDED in a melting pot of mentally abusive people. I'm starting to get very paranoid about this. I'm questioning SOOOO HARD right now who in my life TRULLLLY has my best interest at heart. 

I think about my best friend. Female friend. Of 5 years. Can I be honest? We're both pretty shady TO EACH OTHER. I love her, and I know I do and I know I always will- but I feel like I've been lacking in our friendship, just because HER shady parts make me question if she's really a real friend. I feel bad, because I WANT to be a good friend, and give our friendship the TLC it needs, but I am too emotionally exhausted to be fucked with it right now. I'm questioning is she's really there for me, I'm questioning if ANYBODY's really there for me. And because of that, I have become a quick-quitter friend. Or an ""only on easy terms"" friend. I NEVER used to be like this. The only reason I have lately become that is because I question people's intentions for ME. If God came to me today to let me know she was 100% down, THEN I WOULD BE TOO. I would be a GREAT friend. But when I get into a state where I am questioning a person, I lack on my effort, as much as I hate to admit it and feel kinda bad. 

I'm trying to think of an example of some of the shady things she does/says that won't tumble into a whole ENTIRELY off-topic story, and fuck up my character count (which it's probably already too late for my character count. Lol, we will see.... I may have to put this on a doc.) Hmm...

Okay well next I guess I will mention my guy friend. He's a friend with benefits. This is going to sound TERRIBLE, PLEASE do NOT judge him. You can MOST CERTAINLY judge ME, go ahead and judge me, because I was OBVIOUSLY in the wrong, but we met through me kind of/sort of cheating on my ex (which, by the way, was NOT the reason for our relationship ending. and the reason I say 'kind of sort of' cheating, is because my ex agreed to an open relationship, but I also only know he only agreed to it to make me happy and shut me up. The reason I was asking for one was to fix out relationship problems, since I wasn't feeling fulfilled in our relationship, but also didn't want to lose him, AND LIKE I SAID, THIS WAS MY FIIIRST RELATIONSHIP, SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN GIVING UP ON PEOPLE, BUT THIS WAS LOOKING LIKE MY EMOTIONALLY-UNFULFILLEDNESS WAS ABOUT TO CAUSE MY VERY FIRST BREAKUP EVERR, AND I WAS PANICKING AND IN FREAK-OUT MODE, SO I WAS DESPERATE TO TRY ANYTHING TO SAVE OUR RELATIONSHIP. So I proposed an open one. Coincidentally, we did end up breaking up around that time anyways, despite that THAT was NOT the cause, just because I KNEW that I had to end it the moment I realized I could ACTUALLY even STOMACH being intimate with somebody else. It wouldn't have been fair to him. My plan had failed, miserably, and looked like an asshole while I was just trying to tape shit together.) Anyways, back to my guy friend. It was his friend. YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO JUDGE ME, I'm not going to try to convince you not to. It just kind of happened, I didn't plan it. My ex's friend came into my inbox after me and my ex officially posted that we were in an open relationship on facebook. I'm not dumb, I knew he was thinking I was just some kind of hoe and gonna try to use me, but the only reason I kept the (nonsexual) conversations going with the guy is because, not to sound conceited lol, but I knew that after he got to ACTUALLY know me that his opinion would change and he would ACTUALLY like me as a person. And that did happen. I was right. I knew I was right, or else I would have never entertained him in the first place. We meet alone for the first time, not on anything sexual at all, just talked and had some AMAZING deep conversation all night. Sunrise comes and he's trying to make a move. I'm hesitant, but I end up letting it happen because he's trying to eat me (and I had never been eaten before in my LIFE). I'm feeling bad, thinking about my ex and shit. Fidgeting hard as fuck, tears in my eyes, I wanted to stop halfway through but since I had already started I felt OBLIGATED to finish, I didn't know what this guy was capable of, what if I would have told him that I wanted to quit and he assulted me or something? (Lucky now, I know he would never do that. But that moment was VERY scary for me. VEEERRY scary.) I asked him to tell my ex what happened, AND THAT IF HE DIDN'T, THAT I MOST DEFINITELY WOULD BE TELLING HIM. And I would have. I most definitely would have. When I fuck up, I confess, INSTANTLY. I'm actually very much NOTORIOUS for IMMEDIATE confessions. I have made immediate confessions to my ex before, for other stuff, so I most definitely have no problem doing so. I don't hide shit, and when I fuck up, I DO feel bad. It eats at me alive, EVEN LOOOOONG AFTER the deed is done. 

So, basically this dude becomes my second best friend. And my ex knows it. I'm not hiding it from him. He's not even mad any more. His friend is my friend now. THEY WERE'NT SUPER-CLOSE FRIENDS ANYWAYS, BEFORE ANYBODY IS SITTING HERE THINKING THIS WAS HIS BFF OR SOMETHING. IT'S NOT. (still doesn't make me any less of an aint shit bitch, though, which I'm not proud of) Let's call the guy R. R is still my really good friend to this day, and we DID end up going even further on a later date. It's crazy, because despite me knowing that R did NOT have good intentions for me from the jump, he actually turned out to be one of the realest friends I have. I know he has my back. I can talk openly and honestly to him about the inevitable doubts I have about him, and he does not get mad, he understands that I feel bad for having such poor judgement upon meeting him, and just has my back. I'm tearing up writing this now, because it's crazy how the LAST person you'd expect to be real and be there for you ends up being the realest one on your team. He's a swinger, I'm okay with that. I don't want a relationship right now, or for a while even (8 years at least lol). We friendzone each other haha. He's just that one person I can be bluntly honest with about ANYTHING, the good, the bad, the ugly, the horriffic... and he never friend-breaks-up with me or threatens to. 

SO what I'm thinking about doing is, cutting everybody off besides R for 2018. And I feel bad for wanting to do this, because MAYBE my ex actually WASN'T mentally abusive, and I was just reading into it too much. MAYBE my best friend (let's call her K) WASN'T a fake friend, and actually had my back. So, I feel bad for wanting to do this, but I think I need to, to have the time to reflect without the blinders on. Right now I have love-blinders on for T and K because I care about them, and WANT them to be real. I think the only way to truly evaluate whether or not they are worth being in my life is to take a step back and live without them. But then, what if I never get them back? It's all so scary and complicated.

K recently called me emotionally abusive. And you know what, I think I am a bit. Not because I'm a terrible person who WANTS to be, but because I feel like the more and more I live in this dysfunctional house, the more it rubs off on me. I am becomming the people I live with, and it TERRIFIES ME to the max. There are days I'm SO irritable now, because I turn my saddness (my sadness over becomming them) into anger, and when I turn it into anger then I'm REALLY them, because they're so bitter! See, it's a vicious cycle, and as much as I NEED, and PRAY, and HOPE, and CRY that I break the cycle, I'm starting to realize that it is all I know- so how? How could I? I WANT to be a good person, a good listener, a person with empathy and compassion- all things I have SEVERELY been lacking on lately. If I had it my way, I'd be a philanthrope, a hippe. But instead I am slowly but surely becomming the opposite- a misanthrope, and a representation of my least favorite kinds of people.

I don't know what to think, do, or begin. I am becomming narcisstic, I feel it. It is due to an EXTREME resentment I am holding over the family I reside with, and their narcisstic tendancies are rubbing off on me. Even if/when I get out of this hell house, I fear the effects will come with me to the new house. 

I'm only 20, but since 19 I have been stuck in what feels like a quarter-life crisis. And I hope it's just that. I hope it's a phase. I hope I grow out of it, and become a successful, good-hearted person. But right now, I'm a purposeless, valueless waste and a BUM, who is starting to grow a cold heart that I really don't have. Idk. Does this make sense? Does anybody have experience with something similar to this, and will it get better?

tl;;dr I don't want to become emotionally abusive and narcisstic, but i think I am becomming just that

also drowning in depression from the effects of my mentally abusive family, and pretty damn bedridden (i'm lucky if i have energy to shower. and brush my teeth?? holy shit i need a grammy for that!!!)

51,"I just created a forum about this on a website I am starting up, so I can link that at the end. I don't really care where the discussion happens, but I would love to hear some feedback around this.

I think a big contributor to some stigma around mental health comes from a larger societal conditioning not to talk about what is going on in our mind. There are a lot of factors culturally and individually which contribute to this. Do you think tech is currently helping others to vent mental turmoil? Furthermore, looking towards future technologies do you see tech platforms helping this venting process? If so, do you think it is actually beneficial to vent online to non-physical allies.

One last caveat could you see tech platforms providing a space to talk about mental well-being. So rather than strictly aiding others in alleviating mental health issues, providing means to increase mental health to a more optimal level. Can our culture have a discussion about mental well-being and feel it to be healthy rather than egotistical?

52,"Hello, I actually wanted to look for a spanish forum to look for advice, but I didn't find any forum.

I moved to Spain (Mallorca, to be exact) about half a year ago and idk what I can do for my mental health.
I've known for a few years that something isn't alright and I'm pretty sure I've had a kind of anxiety (GAD), but it got better. Lately, I haven't been feeling okay mentally and the school stress doesn't make it better you know. 

So what I want to know is, what I can do. I really want to go to a therapist, but that costs tons of money, right? I read somewhere (in english) that in usa/uk/idk where that the insurance will pay the therapist if you have a diagnose. But I'm in Spain and idk what I can do or if the insurance will pay it or if I have to pay it. 

Someone help please... idk what to do and i don't want to spend money. It would upset my mom. I know that my mental health is important, but it might just make things worse. 

Thanks in advance, I appreciate everyone's help",01Dec2017,1,

54,"Throwaway because yeah. The reason I'm posting here is because I keep getting too anxious to call my local mental health facility and it's a lot easier to type.

Basically my mental health has been deteriorating for a while now. I stopped taking my meds, I've been self harming, I feel somewhat suicidal, and my PTSD flashbacks have been getting worse. Mentally I feel like I'm going to explode. When I talked about it with my mom (and I am 19 but still live at home) she said that all of this is self inflicted because I'm off my meds and that I need to just get over myself. Naturally that made me feel even worse. While she does have a point, I still feel like there's more to this than simply taking my meds again. I really feel like I need help before I do something extremely stupid.

Would hospitalization be the right thing to do? Also background: I have been battling mental illness since I was 12 and I have been hospitalized twice in my life. They always change my diagnosis, but at the moment they've settled on borderline, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and possible psychosis (due to the fact that I hear things and see things).

57,"Out of all the writings I have done, and will do, this part is the most difficult. The one that lays bare my soul, the true vulnerability I find hardest to talk about but today I break that. I may be using a throwaway account for the moment in order to hide who I really am but it’s the first step, preparing me to really come forward. For the moment I will keep my identity quiet. This had the most impact on my mental health I believe, the one that caused the most damage and took it’s toll on my mind. 

I think I was 6 when the sexual abuse started. Most people may jump to the conclusion that it was my dad or uncle but no, instead it was my half-sister. I don’t really know how it started or the first instance, I repressed a lot of that but from as far back as I can remember it began by taking me into her room, she would undress me and begin the process of trying to, I guess sexually arouse me even though I had no idea what that was. I don’t think I need to go into detail about what happened but once she gained an erection from me she would force myself inside her. I would be an object for use. She would tell me it was ok, that half sisters and brothers do it all the time. I know she did this to reassure herself, I never really knew what was happening. Or what was going on. I was 6. She was the adult in my eyes being 5-6 years older. This went on till I was about 8 or 9. 

She would always tell me to never tell mother and dad. Always saying that they would not love me anymore, using fear as a weapon to keep me quiet, threaten me that I would be sent away. And after some time it became the norm, I let it happen. Fear and shame did consume me and as I got older I think that is when I realised it was wrong but I did everything in my power to place this deep inside my mind into a location held far away. Unfortunately this was not deep enough. During the abuse in the early days I would go to a safe place, as such, let my mind wonder in another world. I don’t know where this was but it helped. As it continued through the years I think I began to enjoy it in some way, not sexually but.. I don’t know, something. I still felt great fear and shame but maybe feeling close to someone, being a part of something gave me enjoyment. I think that is why I felt so much guilt about it. I am still pondering this part. I always wonder maybe it is because I accepted my fate with this, it just became normal.

I don’t know when it stopped, I don’t remember the last time she abused me but this is the morbid part. Or the part I don’t understand. Everything went back to normal. I acted as though noting ever happened. She lived in the same house and I grew up into a teenager saying nothing. She moved out and then it was just me. Me and my broken self. The older I got the more aware I became of what happened to me, but thanks to that lovely perception of what a “man” is supposed to be I kept forcing it back into the darkness. Denying it, feeding it the hate, anger, shame and fear which made it grow. I always wondered why I was so explosive with my emotions, having to prove something, to be the man. I began to use drugs. I would steal my dads painkillers (until I was 19), smoke a lot of pot, use illegal class Bs and the newly loved legal highs in order to “feel” happy. Add in steroids to feel that real “masculinity” and you get the idea. Always using something to make me feel.

I struggled with relationships, I could never get close to someone or really let them know who I am. I would withdraw and times and when things got too deep, brink of admitting how broken I felt, I would mess around with someone else, giving them a reason to hate. I always needed them to hate. I was very hypersexual. Using it as a way to feel again. I do think that the abuse has played a hand in this but I have yet to connect the dots and rationalise why and how. 

It was early 2017 when all this began to come back in flashbacks. The fucked up part of the flashbacks were that I would they would come to me then drift away into the darkness and automatically I would think “that is going to kill me”. It was like I already knew it was going to get worse and that I knew deep down I would kill myself in order to escape. Self-fulfilling prophecy you could say. Dreams would turn to nightmares and the shame came back with a vengeance, waking up overwhelmed with fear of people knowing who I truly am. I began to drink more, began to party again with old friends that included a lot of cocaine or MDMA, I just wanted it all to go away. This resulted in one night of heavily using cocaine, coming home to the beautiful woman I share a bed with and finally breaking down. For the first time in my life I showed someone who I really am and I was scared. 

I wish it had happened a more constructive way but either way I am glad.  Because for the first time in my life I feel genuinely happy. Not faked, I opened myself up fully to someone and they embraced me. I felt loved. From that point everything started to get better. This year has thought me so much about myself and allowed me to become the man I always wanted to be, which is me. I recovered that  idea of who I am. I am self aware and manage to deal with my emotions far better along with having the most wonderful and amazing woman help me along the way. Without her I don’t think I would have been alive for much longer. I do owe my life to her. 

I don’t talk to my half sister. I had began to drift away from communicating but now I have none at all and I am happy with that. I don’t have to pretend that she took away my childhood, pretend everything’s fine. She left me broken through many years, not allowing myself to be me. She asks my dad from time to time why not but he is happy with my response of not wanting to talk about it. 

Counselling has been the biggest help with not only finding the real me but also allowing me to come to terms with what has happened and how I can cope with this through he rest of my life. I will never forget what happened to me, but I can now manage it. What is wonderful is when I do talk about it I don’t have that thought “this is going to kill me”. In fact I am content with that part of my life I can talk about it now. I know I did nothing wrong, I was so young and did not know better. I did not know what sex was. I think being able to finally accept that has also helped. In some ways saying no and telling mother or dad was not option. I was powerless and I have accepted that. I live my life a lot better now, I currently help people for a living and currently working on a degree that will allow me to work with young adults and children who may have suffered the same as I. I am working on being able to speak more openly about this but the impactions with family may cause this to be an issue. 

How do I feel about this all? Content now. For years I guess hate, resentment, shame, guilt and fear consumed me. I am genuinely happy, I feel things now. This was probably the hardest part of my life to get over but once it was done I felt like I can now really begin to live. I am 26 but I have many years ahead of me still to go. 

*As always, any questions please ask away, share your experiences or even just give some information on how you cope. I hope you enjoyed reading this (as morbid as it sounds) but this was the hardest to write, a step forward to finally making it public. I have quite a few things going on for the next couple of weeks so will be taking a break from writing. Expect the next part around the 15th.

59,"I used to see a therapist weekly when I went to college (one of those clinics where they train therapists), and kept that going for a while afterwards, but the therapist's schedule got too crowded, and I was given the choice of either setting up with a new therapist or just leaving therapy. I decided to leave therapy, and have been somewhat okay for a few months now.

Lately, though, I feel like there might be something wrong with me beyond just my previously diagnosed GAD and depression. I don't think I have a personality disorder or anything, but I also don't think those two things fully explain what's going on, either. Things are still relatively okay, but some aspects of me are starting to become worrying.

Basically, I'm just thinking about going back to therapy, and I'm not sure how to go about it. Currently, I can either wait a couple of months and get back in at the clinic for ~$50/month, with the clinic being about 60 miles away, or I can look into online therapy, which would cost me ~$150/month. Real, normal therapy would be even more (like ~$400/month), and I just can't afford it. I have no idea what to do. I've heard online therapy could be good, but it's also a lot more expensive.

In your experience, do you think online therapy could help me sort out issues that might be more in-depth than just GAD and depression? Things like improper emotional responses to things, rapid change of mood/motivation, etc.

61,"Hello, community of Reddit,

I have got a problem to share with you. Maybe you will be able to help me somehow.

I always wanted to be a music producer which would play for big crowds, make people happy through music, meet with my fans, taking them to dinner or somewhere to spend time with me or even pay them for their tickets to festivals etc.

When I started producing music I was really hyped and I knew what I wanted I knew who I want to become and that I have worked hard on my music production skills. I even wanted to start singing but umm it was sounding horrible. 

After 2 years of doing nothing than looking on tv series and movies, I suddenly realized... What happened to my dreams? What happened to the old me that wanted their dreams to come true? Where is that? How I can get back to that point I was working every single minute trying to improve myself...

I moved out from my parents right after school (its 2 months now), to change my environment. I even met few new people to find out if maybe I am just bored of my life and of what I am doing... But nothing of this helped.

I am feeling worse and worse every day. In my mind, I am like YEAH LET'S DO THIS. But then I sit in front of my PC and I just open another TV series to watch or the youtube to read the mean comments people write (they are sometimes funny though).

Also, next thing I've tried is to make a TO DO list but this didn't help. I did like 3 first things in the morning and then I was back to doing meaningless stuff.

Please help me somehow... I don't want to feel like this anymore. How can I fight with that? How can I win a fight inside myself?",01Dec2017,3,

64,"I’m mentally ill and have a chronic illness, leaving me nearly housebound and alone. I’ve been on so many antidepressants and forced into social gatherings and still end up feeling invisible and usually managing to piss somebody off. The pills never worked, I’ve never felt anything more than sadness and anxiety and tired. Talking to others and hearing encouraging words don’t seem to help at all, and I don’t seem to care.


I take opiates for my chronic illness and taking more than I should makes me feel a bit better. My family members get a kick out of calling me a pill popper and a dope fiend and a drug addict, and they don’t really seem to care as long as I’m not bothering them. I don’t care at all anymore, yes the looks and name calling bothers me and hurts my feelings and the jokes about being nearly 30 and never driven or even been kissed by a boy make me feel even worse. I’ve given up asking for help because each time I have, I was blown off or couldn’t afford to see a specialist or therapist. I believe that I am not meant to get better, that I should give up since no one is willing to help, or even guide me on how to get help. 


I’m only waiting to die now, and I can’t wait. I don’t want to be bothersome any longer, I can see how much my family members hate having me around, especially my nieces and nephews. It hurts, but I don’t care about bothering to try and get help. I have no reason to anyway, I’m not worth much alive, I don’t think they’d notice if I just dropped dead.

My fundamental personality structure was very unique.  I was a bit obsessed with morality, the concept of utopia, and philosophy. I liked the book by Hermann Hesse called the steppenwolf.  It wasn't the literal content of my ideas. It was the personality behind it.  I was part of a dying breed. I wasn't so much a hedonist, as I was a pensive morose wallowing philosophical person.  I think I had a beautiful soul, but with it came certain existential problems relating to my relationships.  It was the end of the world at the end.  I really loved who I was. There was only one person who knew me. His name was Tom.  Nobody else.
