2,"Here's some context:

The good:
I eat well. I exercise, a lot. I have hobbies. I go to therapy, and omg it helps so much. I had the same therapist for the last 2.5 yrs. I have a loving, supportive partner. I try to have insight on my issues and work on them.

The bad:
My therapist is moving, I need a new one. I have anxiety and OCD. I'm graduating but don't feel ready to be done with school. I need a job but don't have one yet. School is too much pressure on me right now. My constant stress is weighing down my relationship.

The ugly: I am conflicted in that I am obviously feeing negatively enough for it to affect my personal life, but 99% of the time (now is the 1%) I don't think I have it THAT BAD as others do, that I'm just making excuses/being dramatic, and I just need to try harder. I'll think my OCD problems are better than ever and that I don't have it anymore when I actually do just in different forms. I'll doubt I even have an anxiety problem but little things will make me jump and I'll spend the majority of my day feeling nervous or guilty about something. 

What next? 
Therapy helps tremendously but I feel like I need constant help and attention, daily would be nice. I always have things I need help with and don't have time to ask about. But I'm progressively improving. This therapist and life switch in general is stressful. I'm considering meds but I am terrified of side effects (depression, weight gain, lowered libido, feeling empty) and terrified of what happens when I graduate and don't have insurance til I get a job. If that ever happens. I need to stop drowning my partner in the same story I just wrote here nonstop....

Hopefully this is enough context. What am I missing? What would you do if you were me? Help?!? 

Edit: bonus round: I also pick my skin compulsively and have some gnarly scabs all over my body. I have thoughts on hurting myself by cutting relatively often (every few weeks or so when the pressure build up is too high) but NEVER act out on it due to guilt of what my family and partner would feel if I did",16Apr2017,1

4,"It seems like most of the time people say negative emotions arise from damaged ways of thinking, but what about legitimate reasons for feeling bad? Like chronic disease, starvation, homelessness, and death.

Like, for a homeless person, their feelings of anger and sadness probably have less to do with them thinking incorrectly about the people around them, and more to do with the fact that they are hungry, or being attacked, or have little hope to have a home in the near future.",16Apr2017,3
5,"At my senior prom (almost a year ago) I went back to the hotel room of this guy in my grad class, with the understanding that we would be having sex. When we got back to his room, he asked me for oral sex and I said no. He continued to ask, saying things like ""come on, why not?"" and ""I thought you said you were experienced!"" I was insecure and felt out of my depth, but after more than ten minutes of him pressuring me, I gave him oral, where he proceeded to hold my head down, basically choking me, until I shoved him off. Afterwards, he told me he wanted to come on my face, and I said no to that, so he got himself off and finished on my chest (but he tried to aim for my face and I shoved him downwards.) Is this some form of assault? I struggled with it for months and I still feel sick to my stomach about it sometimes, but I did (begrudgingly) agree to give him oral and we had consensual sex before the oral. I feel like this experience is sticking with me more than I expected. I think I just need to know if other people consider this sexual assault, and I would really appreciate some feedback &lt;3 I know this isn't as traumatic as most people's experiences, but it's hurting me and I need someone to understand.",16Apr2017,2

15,"So I try to make it as short as possible (but it's still a long post) and sorry for any grammatical errors.

I'm a 22 year-old college student.

After doing a vast amount of drugs and realizing myself through LSD I have come to a conclusion. My life has been me trying to please other people and feel little to no accomplishment if there is no one around to praise me. I grew up alone with my mom with no real friends. I have moved over 5 times switching school 3 different times. In the first 4 years of school I managed to get into fights alot and go home with bruises and had no real friends and liked to steal stuff. 2 friends that I got along with used me to get stuff from me, one stole from me and laughed about it later and the other one used me to borrow stuff to him that he never returned. I didn't realized that back then but I didn't wanna end the friendship either, because I had no one else. My mom punished me for all the stupid stuff I did, but now I realize that I did all of that to get her attention.

Next 5 years in new school I didn't fit in either. I got into even more fights, was miserable, had bad grades and got sucked into videogames to escape from all the bad things that were happening. Still had no real friends because I had to make new ones. Since I got into alot of fights in elementary school I only was able to make friends with bad kids that never paid attention in class and were doing all sorts of stupid sh*t like graffiti on houses, smoking and endless fights. But once again I had no one to turn to and went along with all of it. Almost 4 years I got beat up every week, other students made fun of me all the time and since I only knew how to fight back with fists it was an endless cycle. I started to not care about anything and were playing videogames every chance I could get, lunch breaks, after school, before classes, when I got home and were supposed to study.

After transferring to a different school for high-school things got better, I was more grown up, I didn't pick any fights and my grades went up. But one thing still bothered me. I didn't talk any of the people from previous schools, so I was once again all alone in a big city with no one I knew. I didn't really make any real friends. Now I see that all of the friends I had were just hanging out with me cause they had nothing better to do. I always tried to please others and act and say stuff they wanted to hear. First year of highschool I got introduced to alcohol and oh man that was something new. I felt like a new person, talkative and made ""friends"" easily. I could just forget about all the stuff happened in the past and was playing less and less videogames. 

So the last year of high-school a friend from my school introduced me to weed. That is when I feel became a different person. I just chilled and let other people do the talking, went along with their ideas because why not... I don't need to do anything else. Which basically means instead of trying other people to like me more I didn't care about anything. I also got into a relationship with 2 years younger girl who I ended up spending one a half year together. I feel that since she didn't have father growing up either we matched, The relationship ended because I got comfortable and took her for granted, started playing videogames and games on my phone all the time, even when I had very limited time available to spend with her due to me being in the military. It wasn't a nice breakup, I ended up spilling all of my emotions on her not realizing that I caused it all. After that breakup it took me about 3 months to get back on my feet. I started hanging out with a old friend I met a summer camp and after a while we were 5 friends doing alot of drugs and nothing productive at all, we were connected because of weed. But out of 5 friends I was still the 4th  in hierarchy. Which means I kept running after the 3 previous friends and the 5th friend listened to what I had to say (but he isn't the brightest mind). I always tried to be with my friends and always gave more that I got back (spending money on weed, buying them drinks) and could not really speak about my problems because I felt that they weren't listening. 

Now almost 3 years after highschool I have had many failed relationships. I am willing and already building an empire for a woman that likes me back even before we have been together for over a month. I want women to like me so much that I spend have spent my whole paychecks on them just to get more attention from them. And I know it is all because of my childhood, me having no friends and trying to get my moms attention.

Right now I am living on my friends sofa not paying rent because I wanted to move out of my home. My mom was always making drama out of the smallest things. She is staying home with my baby sister and has so much time on her hands to make drama. My friend is really childish and easily used he has no courage to say what he thinks and always when we are out somewhere he seeks for my approval (he also grew up without a father). I acknowledge that and I'm trying not to really use him. But since he has no other real friends but me he gets caught up in everything I do (me wanting to smoke weed, he gets me the fix without me paying, because I have told him that I will smoke with him, but I am not willing to pay any money for it, cause I see no point in it - seems pretty ironic right?) 
So after a recent breakup with a girl that I even didn't get into a relationship but spent about 3 months building a new roman empire for her and a huge throne for liking me It all fell apart because I was so caught up in the moment of happiness that I didn't pay any attention to all the red flags waving over this relationship. Her having mental problems, running away from her problems with drugs, not caring about me all that much and not really making time for me. But I am grateful for all that mess because It made me think about my life alot. The last month when our relationship really fell apart I tried to get her back and tried to fix everything. When I felt like I was not getting any initiation from her part to fix the relationship I started doing drugs, alot. I spent 2 weeks smoking weed all day long not going to work, not doing any homework and playing videogames every day. When I met her I limited my consumption of drugs, drank alot less booze and was amazing chef just to be the best person I can. All of that was me I wanted to be.

At the very moment I am writing I have realized that I really have no sense of purpose or accomplishment when there is no one around to praise me for it. When I grew up I wanted to be a policeman, but that plan failed, I got busted for driving without licence and really don't see myself doing vast amounts of drugs while being a police officer. Now I'm just thinking that I really really want to be a professional skater while giving full house concerts in every city I go to. I still want to be liked real bad and I don't really know if it's a good thing or not. 

I don't like where I am going with my life. I don't want to be that maggot of a person that crawls after any woman I meet. I don't want to do that many drugs. 

But I don't know where to seek help (thought about going to a psychologist, but I don't know if my problem is important enough - a wrong way to think probably). I know that everything you think about yourself and your future and your goals is like a magnet. It attracts whatever you make it attract is it good or bad, doesn't matter. I don't know where my life is heading, but it feels like it's not heading anywhere I want it to head.",17Apr2017,6
16,"My wife had a mental breakdown at the end of January, which resulted in an 8-day hospitalization.  From there she has been on Partial Hospitalization, Intensive Outpatient, Residential, and is now back to an IOP.  She self-admitted for all treatment, and is fully med compliant.  Her diagnosis is Bipolar 2, PTSD, Anxiety, and Major Depression.  I personally have depression, and probably undiagnosed anxiety and PTSD, so the last few months have been a whirlwind for both of us.  She has a team of therapists, psychiatrists, medical doctors helping her, and i've got my own team of professionals and support groups to help me.  We have a large family and friends support network that I tapped when this whole adventure started, and they have been wonderful for us.  In short, we are doing everything we can and should be doing in this situation. 

As we move forward together trying to figure out what our new normal is, we're looking into helpful tools.  One of the suggestions is a weighted blanket, which has all sorts of benefits for people with sensory and emotional issues.  I can recall when I lived in the northeast US, and during the winter months I would pile the blankets on, 2-3 thick.  This kept me cozy warm but also had a noticeable weight, and I always felt snuggled up and safe.

My stepmom is a wonderful person, and just sewed a 20lb weighted blanket for my wife, and she loves it.  Problem is, the blanket is only big enough for one person, and I can see myself getting benefit from it as well.  

I am looking for a queen sized weighted blanket that we can both sleep under and enjoy the benefits of it.  Problem is, all blankets I see on the Internet are for children or single adults, never couples.  Plus I think a blanket that big would have to be at least 40lbs just so we each have enough weight on our respective sides.  Does anybody know of a website that sells weighted blankets for couples?  Would a blanket of sufficient weight and size even be feasible to create and go through general wear and tear?  Is this even a good idea, or should we stick to individual blankets?  

Thank you all for your help and suggestions.",17Apr2017,2

25,"I'm looking for a place where I can get advice from artists about how to live a healthy, (mostly) happy and worth-while art-life. I figured I'd start here.

I studied music composition at a fairly prestigious school but the man I chose to do private lessons with ended up paying no attention to any of my wants or needs and just forced me to be ""disciplined,"" ""structured and orderly,"" and we literally spent a year and a half revising notation on pieces of music I'd written without ever discussing the ideas or the content of the notes I had written. This was already a very difficult period of my life going into these lessons and he just broke me down completely and destroyed my self-esteem. All the other pointless assignments combined with getting absolutely *nothing* in return for the hours of passionate work I did left me completely burnt out.

If you've seen the movie Whiplash, I don't want to make it seem like it was *that* bad, but I finally watched the movie a couple months ago and it sent me into another spiral of angry pent-up feelings. I want to send the guy an angry e-mail telling him to retire and stop crushing and shitting on peoples' dreams but at the same time I feel like that would accomplish nothing and would probably make it worse because I think he'd just go poison my reputation in this city.

Teachers shouldn't be allowed to push their students to the point of having suicidal thoughts. 

Now I have a really hard time doing any sort of work, I'm going to be starting a degree in music therapy (partly because of what I've found trying to recover from his abuse, partly because it's rad), but I'm really nervous that I'm going to have anxiety attacks and just generally a hard time with anything that's going to be judged.

I've written very little music since graduating almost 3 years ago now, I haven't had anyone perform anything (social anxiety) and I'm just at a loss because now I don't have a portfolio so I feel like I can't even apply for retreats or workshops. I feel like everyone is going to treat me as badly as he did.

tl;dr: Art school teacher was a bully, I was burnt out, this was years ago now but I still get really tense and feel horrible when I have to do any work that might be judged or marked. Who do I ask? How do I find a mentor that won't suck?",17Apr2017,1
26,"Hi, a few years ago I started to have a weird paranoia whenever I heard or read something that had to do with acid. It wouldn't matter what the context was or whether it was the drug, the word alone triggered the paranoia. Whenever I see someone in the media with burns to the face also triggers the paranoia. Sometimes I never think about but other times get really bad and I genuinely get scared. 

It started again yesterday when I was going to watch an episode of criminal minds and the two victims suffered an acid attack. What freaked me out was that I chose the episode  randomly as a one off because I had nothing better to do. How did a random episode I chose have the one thing that made paranoid. It was the 15th episode of the season and I think my paranoia started in 2015. This really freaked me out and I felt pretty depressed last night and thought that maybe I was hearing things while trying to sleep but I'm pretty sure they were just people outside and my bed creaks being incredibly prominent due to my state of mind and the silence in my house. It only got worse this morning when I was going through Twitter and read about an acid attack in London. This was twice in a row when I went so long without thinking about it. I think that this may be a warning sign to try and stop me from taking a certain path in life. Like whenever I change my career path (I am very fickle) these warning signs appear like it's telling me not to do it. 

There is only one career path that I tried to pursue that I don't think I had any warning signs with. Problem is I think I'd be horrible in that career so it makes no sense that the ""universe"" would guide me to that career path. I am aware that these are delusions and it likely doesn't mean anything but a part of me is still terrified. I am terrified that one day I will be harmed by an acide attack and will forever regret not listening to the signs. 

I should also add that I have really bad social anxiety and still can't bring myself to see a therapist. I don't have the money for one anyway. I find it really difficult to stay on a certain path because my paranoia gets in the way and I take it as a warning sign to not go on that path or else I will be hurt. What can I do to look past this. Life is already hard enough dealing with social anxiety and being scared to leave my house. The only thing that keeps me going are life goals but those life goals keep getting interrupted by my paranoia and these ""signs"" telling me not to reach those goals or I will fall victim to an acid attack.

33,"I have struggled on and off, for I don't know how long. I've never sought help from a professional for a couple of reasons, the main reason was until semi-recently I couldn't get any medical coverage because before the ACA insurance providers could deny me because I have a pre-existing condition in the form of a genetic disease. And I still didn't seek to talk to anyone because I'm not sure how much it will help. I know what my problem is, I can't let go of all the BS that I had to deal with growing up. Even though I know none of it actually matters anymore.

Basically everyone, or mostly everyone, in my family kind of bullied me. For some backstory to this, my mother is a piece of work, she's a pathological liar and a kleptomaniac. And those are just the least terrible things about her. My brother and myself were raised by our maternal grandmother (me since I was 5 my older brother since he was about 7 and then my mom decided to have more kids when the state already told her she wasn't allowed to have kids, but since my younger brothers were 6 months and 3 days old). Nobody in my family likes my mother, not even the people on my father's side. I get that, there are lots of reasons to not like her. The problem is, they kind of took that out on me. They treated me like I was her. They judged me whenever I made a mistake or acted like a little shit when I was a kid as if I did what my mother had done. They either were straight forward about it or said backhanded things to me about me. 
One example is, my mom taught me how to play some board game, I don't remember which, so when I was playing the game with a younger 2nds-couins I told her the rules I was told. Then her grandmother(my aunt, my mother's sister) came over and corrected the game giving the *actual* rules and then made some comment about how I like to make up my own rules about things ""just like her mother"".
That was the mantra whenever I would mess up in any way, I was constantly told that ""You're just like your mother."" She had done a lot of really terrible things. So for me to be told that since I was, at the oldest 7 years old, all the time and treated by everybody that I was just like her because I'm biologically her daughter, really messed with me for a long time, still does a little. I have one cousin, in particular, my only aunt's daughter, who is about 7 years older that I am, and she was always just a terrible person to me growing up. She called me a reject when I was I think 9, for some reason. I don't know what makes a 9-year-old a reject to a 16-17-year-old person.
If you are wondering about my Dad's side of the family, well they I only saw his mother a couple times a year, and I didn't really meet any of his brothers until his funeral when I was 19 and I haven't seen or heard from any of  them since that was almost 12 years ago. One of them claimed to have met me when I was a baby and seemed to think that counted for something. His mother was a real shitlord to my older brother because he wasn't her son's child but my mom had my older brother long before she even met my dad.

None of these people matter to me at all. I don't really hold any resentment towards them. I don't really consider them family beyond genetics. I don't care about them, what they think and feel about me doesn't actually matter to me. I just don't know how to let any of this go. And talking to them is pointless because they won't care or feel the need to apologize for any of it.

37,"Hello everyone,

So I've been suffering from some kind of disorder, which I think was caused by my intake of drugs.

Background story:

At the age of 17 I was exposed to some drug intake- I would smoke weed 3-5 times a week, maybe less than that because I did sometimes make pauses of several days, or a couple of weeks. The whole story with weed was continuing for 2-3 months including those pauses. I cannot say that I was a heavy smoker, rather a medium one, because 1) I have not smoked over 70 joints in those months, 2) and joints were not filled with lots of weed. Then I got clean and did not consume any sort of drugs.

After that, approximately 5 months later, I tried LSD for the first time and I could not say that anything was wrong- it was good and fun. I took 3 more times LSD that year. After that I started noticing how my memory and cognitive abilities started decreasing. The same kind of thing happened after smoking weed regularly, but I got rid of it in like 1-2 months. So I stopped taking any sort of drugs. I have not been taking any drugs for 2 years, although periodically drunk alcohol in moderate volumes, not too often either.

Although I was clean for such a long period of time, I noticed that my concentration and focussing abilities have been reduced as well as my memory got wrose. I cannot say that this has affected me badly as I was still able to score very high in all tests (2100 SAT score for international student) and graduated from school as an A student. However, what really bothered me was that everything was misty, so I was walking around like in a dream with tunnel vision, with focus levels decreased, it being difficult to concentrate on something, I could not take anything seriously until I was sat somewhere and was pushing myself to think about something to make me feel serious about the matter. Some days I felt this effect of haziness more, some days less. It is worth mentioning that I was going through a more or less difficult period of time and from time to time experienced anxiety.

More recent events:

This year I got exposed to drugs once again, this time I did cocaine, ketamine (once), mdma (once), weed (several times with pauses) and lsd (3 times). The haziness did not go away, although I was feeling much better this whole year despite the fact of my drug intake. Nevertheless, after rather recent events, the whole situation got worse. Approximately 3 months ago, the next morning after another smoking session, I felt blessed-- nothing seemed misty, the haziness disappeared I could focus very well. I was so happy that this effect was now gone. Approximately 3 weeks from then, 2 months from this moment, I decided to take LSD, a standard 200 ug blotter, and the trip was quite stressful, although I can't call it a super bad trip, just rather unpleasant. The next day I felt some haziness but I was not concerned with that as this is normal after an lsd trip. However, 2 days later I did lsd and weed again. Though the trip was not hard at all, because of the tolerance and the amount of weed smoked. Still after that day I was feeling this haziness for 2 weeks more.

After that I was on a week trip with my friend in another country where we smoked 1 joint with hashish consequently for 4 days. I was getting pretty high from it, although again, these joints did not contain lots of substance in it.
The haziness did not go anywhere- even worse, I feel like I am constantly like in a dream- i.e. it is so difficult for me to comprehend information. At the moment of writing I have not been using any drugs for 3 weeks, neither did I drink anything.

The issue:

My cognitive performance or however it is called has been decreased. I feel like I am in a dream, it is difficult to comprehend information for me, although I still do understand everything pretty well. What pisses me off is that it takes me longer to understand particular information that it used have. My short term memory has also suffered. Moreover, it is difficult for me to formulate my thoughts into normal comprehensive sentences, and sometimes I have to stop to think about what's going on right now- for example, I am going downstairs, and I have to think for about 2-3 seconds in the following way: ""Where am I? Oh, I am in my house, going downstairs.... now, I am in the kitchen... what am I doing here? 5 seconds after I realise that I came here to take my meal out of microwave oven"". This shit pisses me off.

I think that this is related to my drug usage, correct me if I am wrong. Because I have not been feeling anxiety for several months now. I am trying to keep a good diet, drink water, although not sure if I drink enough because I am not taking account of that. I don't do sports. My sleep pattern is also fucked up- I go to bed at 2-3 and wake up at 11. Not sure if this affects my whole situation.

If you reached this sentence, first of all I would like to thank you for your attention. Finally, I would like to know what's happening wiht me and the reason for that. Is it normal? I do not think so, because it cannot be said that I am functioning well, despite the fact that I manage to do things well while being so fucked up. I've also decided to stop using any drugs forever now. Is there any kind of medicine that could help me? Am I doing something wrong? Or should I simply wait? However, in the latter case, I doubt it will be of much use, as I've been clean for two years previously after my first exposure to drugs and I was still feeling this effect. I am in need of desperate help.

Thank you a lot!",17Apr2017,1
38,"I guess the title might be confusing. I'll try to explain in better. I am a 20 years old male and my dad died a year (and a few days) ago, which I found very traumatizing. Since his death I have found myself in different levels of the grieving process. The first few months I visited the graveyard at least once a week, but later on I did not need to visit the graveyard that often anymore to express my emotions.
I have been aware of my emotions and I witnessed how they changed throughout the year. One thing I find very hard is controlling them. Before his death I could control my emotions, I was happy at all times and sometimes neutral. Since my dads death my emotions are often neutral and also reasonably often depressed. Sometimes (mostly when I am with friends) I am happy.
The thing I find strange is, I don't consciously miss my dad when I am sad. My emotions changed by his death, but the fact I am sad a lot doesn't seem to have a direct link with missing him. His death made me have permanent stress.
Now I do have a lot of great friends and family, and I am also pretty happy with myself as I am, so that doesn't seem to link with the sadness too. I don't what makes me sad and how I can better the current situation of my emotions. As you probably can tell by now it's pretty hard to explain. I have been thinking about a PTSD, but I am not sure. I definitely want to change my emotion management, but I don't know where to start as I don't know what the problem is exactly. By the way, I live in The Netherlands and I don't have a medical history that might be relevant.
Can you help me to understand myself? This might seem like I wrote this post to vent but trust me, I really want to know what the problem is and how I can fix it. Thanks a lot in advance! ",17Apr2017,4

48,"I had a manic episode with psychosis last year that lasted about a month that I am still kind of recovering from (unfortunately). At the time of the episode I was attempting to do improv comedy in the city of Chicago. I was enrolled at the iO theater and doing shows around the city. I've wanted to do that since I was a child. It is such a big deal for me to be here doing improv and before the mania I was happy, engaged, and social and not very fearful at all. During my manic episode I performed improv at a theater and I have no memory of it. I remember a guy there who looked like someone I used to date and I worry that I may have been harassing him, but again I have no memory of the incident. Then another guy in the improv community took me to my apartment. I couldn't remember my address and kept telling him I was Jesus. Idk if he thought I was doing a bit? But he accompanied me to my room and started making out with me. Suddenly I flipped and started accusing him of rape (he didn't rape me obviously) screaming and yelling, I had no control. He left angrily. When I left the hospital I wanted so badly to just reenter the comedy community because it has always felt so important to me, but now almost a year later I am horrified. I feel uncomfortable watching shows, sometimes they trigger delusions, I worry that people in the theater know about what happened either at the show or that i wrongly accused that dude of rape. I keep going to classes because I like the actual performing part and it's one of the only times I can get out of my head which has suddenly become a very scary head to be in. I don't know where this has come from but men suddenly frighten me. I feel like I can't communicate with them get a lot of anxiety around them shake and just generally act weird. I worry they're misreading my anxiety as a stalkerish thing or an attraction thing and that coupled with my breakdown and how disheveled and just generally mentally ill I always look is not the best impression I should be leaving with people I meet or people who are important at the theater. and mostly I worry  just that people think I'm crazy or can tell that I'm crazy or heard that I'm crazy. I know it's probably innocuous and people have their own lives and they've probably seen bipolar folk before, but I'm very alone here. I talk to my therapist about this stuff but it's not generally helpful mostly because she's not a manic and I don't think she totally gets it. She just says ignore it, or don't worry about other people, but I do? I need to meditate more maybe. Sometimes I wish I were just a guy because I feel like mentally ill women freak people out so much. Guys probably deal with a similar problem when they're mentally ill, I just sort of feel defective and don't want to be a ""crazy"" woman but that's what I am and there is nothing I can do about it? I'm sure Im just overreacting. Anyway sorry for all of that. Thanks ahead of time for any advice.",17Apr2017,2
49,"I've had problems with self harm and issues with suicidal thoughts and insomnia and ( not diagnosed ) anxiety like issues, it's pretty much all in my dad's side and I've been to the doctors at least 5 times and been turned away with two referrals to CAHMS', a cognitive therapy booklet, advice to exercise and eat healthily and none have ever helped me. I've also had numerous councillors either provided by my old school or college I'm now in. I don't feel that talking about it helps because they expect me to figure out a way to fix it, which is something I've been trying to do for many years now. I feel lazy most days and absolutely awful about myself depending on if it's how I look, how I act, and just almost every aspect about myself, and barely eating comes in hand with this, and often purging. I rarely see my friends and I don't even feel as if my own family like me and it's just constantly draining, and I've tried telling this to doctors before and it becomes embarrassing building up the courage to try and get help and only getting turned away each time. It's getting overwhelming and I'm finding it hard to cope (I'm sorry for talking about it so much in detail and if it doesn't make sense I'm just lost for answers now.)",17Apr2017,2

60,"Hello everyone. 

I'm really feeling like absolute shit right now. Its about how I feel, which is odd for me.

I'm usually a hyper, talkative, funny, and jovial person over all. I am also typically a bombastic, impulsive, impatient, short tempered, anxious, annoying, unfocused, and forgetful individual. 

This is normal, and I've known this for so long. My doctor actually told my Mom that I might have ADHD when I was 9, but she decided not to get me help because of my IQ scores and standardized test scores. (I was in the 99th percentile for both at the time. My IQ hasn't changed since then). Just recently, my usual quirks started getting the best of me; procrastination became a habit, and paying attention to things that bore me are an impossible endeavor. Anything tedious or repetitive either makes me zone out or get frustrated due to boredom. For example, my grade last quarter was 94% in AP Bio, but we had a test over protein synthesis which had little to no questions on protein synthesis, and had about 15 of the 25 questions that had nothing to do with what we did in class for the week before. Those 15 questions were about how well we could read a nucleotide base table, and amino acid chart and answer the missing corresponding nucleotides etc. Point is, the whole damn test was fucking busy work, and my brain shut down. I ended up scoring 42% on it, and it dropped my grade from a 94 to a whopping 86 which really sucked. Also, I have been struggling to stay awake and pay attention in Calculus; the class is so boring to me, and I zone out in there every single day. I currently have a C- in there. The ACTs have also been a struggle, as my friends who I am way smarter than, score 30s while the best I could muster was a 27.

My parents realized that they were stupid for not taking me to a psychiatrist yet, and set me up to meet with one this July. 

This is all and well, but I have been having separate issues in the last couple months. About 7 monts ago, I started feeling really depressed about nothing rational ( Actually, it still upsets me thinking about it. Its a long story, but in short, my friend who was also a girl and my former crush, asked me to not go on a date for specific reasons. Her concerns were somewhat legitimate, but she didn't HAVE to make me break it off with this senior. My friend was  jealous and insisted on me breaking it off with this girl, which I finally did. After this, I thought that my friend/crush was into me, but it turns out, she was helping this other dude with his break up, and they clicked and became a thing. The dude is 10x better than me in everything except athletics, and maybe IQ, so I had no shot with my crush. I shouldn't be too mad at her though, we are both tens, and don't know what we are doing/what we like/ etc., so I let it go. We are still friends but I'm still upset about it. ), but I went through really awful depression for the following 2 months, and binge drank did drugs ( bad stuff tbh, not just ""weed"" ). Anyways, I stopped feeling so shitty maybe after new years, and was feeling great for the last 2 months or so. Unfortunately, those months of normalness ended about two weeks ago, and I've been starting to gradually feel worse and worse about everything. The last week has been really hard, and I'm starting to feel indifferent about everything. I don't know how else to describe this, but I'm starting to feel extremely lethargic for no reason, and have been having existential thoughts. I'm starting to hate everything, and I'm feeling extremely neurotic. I almost feel like my feelings have been sucked out of me, and that I couldn't care about my outcome, or anything that is in my life. It is all feeling meaningless, and my enthusiasm for everything has been crushed. I'm starting to feel like my existence isn't relevant at all in the greater scheme of things, and how awful humans are. I've always considered myself am optimist, but no. Right now, I'm feeling more distaste for the world than Nietzsche ever did. I just feel empty. 

I don't know exactly what is wrong with me, but I think I may be depressed or something. I just don't know why my mood changes from bliss to melancholy in the matter of weeks.

Any ideas?

Edit: I also forgot to mention that I have chronic migraines, and they were much worse about 4 months ago, and they are tarting to comeback again.",17Apr2017,7
