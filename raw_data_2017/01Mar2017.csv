0,"I am a student in college. I love learning, and I love thinking about problems, but unfortunately, I am afraid of appearing like a certain group of people who I dislike who also fit that profile. Whenever now I have to do an assignment, or think something through, I immediately think of those people who I've put into a box, and I cannot do the assignment. I can feel a part of me desperately wanting to let go of the fear, to manifest it's true power, but the fear is so powerful. It's like a PTSD. I've tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but I've come to the conclusion that only exposure therapy would help me - that is, I would need to make friends with a group of these people, and see that they're human, and that I can be myself without anything bad happening. The problem is, I don't know how to do that. Would I appear weird? How should I help myself? The fear is truly terrifying, depressing, and paralyzing. ",01Mar2017,1

2,"Okay i would put some background information so that i don't sound too off

I am in UBC(University of British Coloumbia) which i think is one of the best engineering schools in canada, and one of the top 20ish engineering schools in north america. 

Also in ubc you have to take general engineering as your first year, and based upon your performance, they put you in your desired discipline in second year. 

Usually, in ubc, getting into mechanical engineering and engineering physics are the most competitive(both are equally competitive so i put and instead of seperating them). Then it would be civil engineering along with computer engineering.

In ubc, we don't have a 4.0 gpa, we have a percentage gpa. So it goes something like that

90s mean A+
85-89 is A
80-84 is A-
75-79 is B+
72-75 is B
68-71 is B-
64-67 is C+
60-63 is C
And so on and so forth

Now here is my story.


I am in second year computer engineering, and my first semester was pretty devastating, i didn't fail any course but my average was only around 61 for my first semester, which dragged my overall gpa down a lot.
I only took 3 courses out of fear that I have seen a lot of cpen/electrical engineering students/senior or upper year friends fail at least a course in first semester, and even after taking only 3 courses my gpa was a devastation.

I was completely shocked, but it seems like a lot of my good friends also performed poorly in their first semester, so I took courage and started putting all my effort into second semester.


Now i am also taking only 3 courses this semester as well, math 220, eosc 114 and elec 201. So far math 220 has been great, i got 90% in the first mid, eosc 114 was supposed to be extremely easy.
But i made 10 mistakes in today's midterm and would most probably end up getting a 67% in this mid, last mid i also got an okayish 74ish average, considering the fact I have studied extensively for both of these midterms and no, I studied regularly and didn't cram at the last moment, even after that I am doing extremely poor in this course where most people would end up getting a high 70s/low 80s.
I am also doing bad in elec 201, even though I have been attending every lecture and doing all the assignments by myself and visiting the regular office hours. Even the prof was taken aback when he heard that i didn't do well in my mid, because I am one of his most regular students who would visit office hours and stuffs.
It seems like i know the subject, i know what to do, I can solve any problem, but somehow i mess up in exam, and i don't know what else i can do. Its kind of really irritating that after knowing the subject matterials so well and such a good preparation i just mess up in exams.
I am pretty devastated right now and don't know what to do?",01Mar2017,1

7,"The quote in the title is from the Marianas Trench song ""Masterpiece Theatre III"" and I feel I applies greatly to my life at the moment. 

About two months ago, I began to have an emotional breakdown. First came the voices. They always come first. Threatening me. Then came the depression. This was worse than usual. You think of the term ""crippling depression"" and that's what describes it best. Some days I couldn't get out of bed. Others i only left my room to use the bathroom. I just sat and played on my computer, where I was a simple farmer named Nora living in Stardew Valley, not psychotic Angela who can't even live properly. Then I started cutting. The pain bled away, but it was only temporary. I needed something permanent to end my pain. So I started horsing my meds. I got a good stash going before I was found out. I tried to keep it together a little longer but finally hit my limit. I snapped and now I'm two weeks into what's panning out to be a long stay in a psych ward. 

They took me off all my meds. I've proven time and time again that they don't work. Here's where the quote comes in. I am, in all senses of the word, insane. I don't know who I am. Some days I lay in bed until noon until the nurse forces me to eat because I can't take my meds on an empty stomach (I'm still on meds for medical reasons, no psychiatric though) other days I stomp around in a bind rage, ready to scream at and beat the shot out of the first person to slightly inconvenience me. Unfortunately, it's my nurses who get the brunt of this anger. Usually the day after this I'm highly sedated from the PRN's they force me to take, so I just blindly wander around. This is one of those days. It's wearing off now, though, that's why I'm able to write this. Other days I'm anxiety ridden and painfully paranoid. I think everyone's out to get me. My current fears are that my roommate will rape me in my sleep, and that the woman that walks around growling and grumbling and glares at everyone is possessed by a demon and wants to kill us all. Sometimes I wake up at night and see a figure standing over my bed. It could be either one of them, so I hide under my covers, where I can wait until a nurse comes to check on my. But I know it's all crazy. But at the same time I believe it's all true. But this is how I get better. The doctors are able to see how truly fucked up I am without medication, so they can treat me properly, with medication and therapy that actually works. I'm getting better, but in the worst possible way. I have to walk through the fire but the prize at the end is worth it. The prize is sanity. ",01Mar2017,1

13,"Hello Reddit, 

So about three years ago I was with a guy who raped me a few times while we were together. He was addicted to porn and once he raped me while he was watching porn. So I have grown a hatred to it, not the people in the porn industry just porn it's self, and the was he would choose it over me time and time again. 
   We lived together and I was willing to have sex I just wanted open communication about my boundaries and when we did have those conversations he promised he would respect them then he crossed them all the time. 
    I have been out of that relationship and have found a man who loves me and wants to be with me, now I can't help but to be paranoid that he is watching it. I already suffer with different mental illnesses and my paranoia is a huge part of it all. He doesn't deserve to deal with my paranoia about it, I am currently in therapy for my past traumas (other along with the ex) 
   My question is how do overcome the paranoia about this amazing man not watching porn. I know in my heart he is telling me the truth but my brain overthinks and over generalized men and sums them into this category and that's not fair for me or him or any other future love interest I may have. I need help in how to believe I am being told the truth. 

Sincerely, 
Paranoid Lady.

15,"Asking this on behalf of my mum because we don't know where to turn and i personally don't know too much about mental health law. 

Im based in the UK and my mum (until yesterday) was working in a small chain caf√©, had been for about 2 years. During this time the stress of the management on her resulted in her being signed off sick due to stress and diagnosed with work related depression and anxiety. She has been on various anti-depressants since the diagnosis and had been doing really well, even putting herself forward for the assistant manager role.  

She had just had a week off sick due to a stomach bug (UK law requires those who work with food to take at least 48 hrs to recover fully i think). Yesterday she was told (quite nonchalantly) that 'the atmosphere was better without her there' and was suggested that she resign, so she left.  The management were fully aware of her situation as the company in question requires that information from their employees, and they have openly spoke about it with her as well. 

We are now trying to see if there is any form of UK law that prevents this form of discrimination in the work place or if there are any organisations or anything like that to turn to that can help? If anyone has any ideas at all we would really appreciate them!

16,"So my friend just recently got diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia, I am doing some research into it just so I can get an understanding of it and may be able to help them if needed.

A couple things that is puzzling me, dose one need to have hallucinations or can one just have delusions? What can happen in these hallucinations, do you only hear/see things or can your mind create a alternative reality? Example: Say you think that Joe said he hates you and a few weeks/months later you run into Joe, your determend that this happened but it actually didn't.",02Mar2017,1
17,"Hey guys and girls I am just on here asking for help. My friend took 5, 120ug tabs by himself and sat on his own all night. He was fine for a few days and said it was the best experience of his life and he felt enlightened. I sit with him every night and have slowly been watching him fall apart. I can't really understand what is going on it is confusing me.

His behaviour,

He keeps being so deep in thought he is trying to say stuff to me and stopping mid sentence and looking into space again.

He has told me he now knows he is head of the illuminati and is a prophet reborn. Talking all this crazy stuff.

I cant have a conversation with him anymore he feels like a different person and tbh last night I had to leave him as I really dont feel safe around him anymore.

He also wont talk about the illuminati or what he believes in his house and made me leave my mobile and electronic devices inside as he talks to me about all this crazy stuff outside.

Last night when I was leaving he asked me.to get out of my car and just stood there staring into space for 5 minutes I asked him was he ok and he said come with me. I just said no and drove off.

I really don't know what is going on and I feel like I am losing my friend should I contact someone about this? I don't know who I think he needs sectioned ",02Mar2017,20

I immediately contacted my doctor who referred me to a psychiatrist.  Ive been referred now to CBT and have been taking 200mg Sertraline which has reduced my libido for around 10 months.  Lately, I have been having very strong urges to return to my old ways.  Obviously I don't want to but the thoughts are becoming obsessional.  I don't have an appointment booked until 10th Apr with my psychiatrist but I'm terrified I'll succumb to these urges and ruin all the work I've put in to overcome this.

22,"I've been having a discussion about self diagnosing mental illnesses, and one point people who are pro-self dx always bring up is how a diagnosis cost money. Personally living in Europe, a trip to the hospital to get a second opinion didn't cost any money, the only thing that DID cost money was therapy sessions once I decided to go through treatment, but as far as I'm aware that's entirely up to the patient. Is this different in the U.S or any other countries? Does a simple trip to the hospital actually cost ""a fortune"" as I've been told? I'm ignorant on the matter. Thanks!",02Mar2017,3

24,"I'm getting acceptances back from Master's programs, which start in the fall of 2017, that I applied to.  I did a ton of research in to so many programs, what their differences are, comparing what is taught to job requirements from job postings I see online in the field.  I applied to a couple programs nearby, but most are all over the country.  I really want to go to the best program I can for the cost, with a proven track record of successful job placements for their past graduates.  Unfortunately, the 2 programs nearby don't have records of their past graduates, which makes me really uneasy about attending them (I can't find many of their past graduates on LinkedIn either).  So I'm looking at moving across the country (USA) to attend the best program I can.

My therapist is strongly urging me to stay in the area.  I've lived here for most of the 28 years of my life, and most of my friends and family reside here.  I currently live in my father's house.  He feels the risk involved with moving and emotionally ""shutting down"" during my program isn't worth moving, but he also seems to think that a Master's degree is a Master's degree regardless of where it's from (I don't agree, I've seen firsthand with my BS degree that employers want you to have the right skills or they won't hire you).  Friends and family agree with going back to school, and most of them just aren't sure what (if?) there's a right decision regarding moving.  Most of my friends and family are pretty supportive about it (both the ones who know and don't know about my mental health issues).

I agree with my therapist that there's a risk involved with moving, certainly.  But I think there's a bigger risk in spending time and money getting a Master's degree that isn't going to land me a good job in the field.  I'm very wary of higher education in general, which is why I want hard numbers on their recent graduates, rather than fluffy ""we don't track them, but they have no problems finding jobs.""  So I feel like my differences with my therapist are due to very different perspectives.

I talked with him a couple days ago about this topic.  He says when he was just starting out as a psychologist, he would've recommended I go, but he says he overestimates his patient's abilities, and now he airs on the side of caution.  I asked him to explain further, and he said he was talking mostly about when people first go away to college and come back after failing a semester, and then he starts seeing them. 

I respect his opinion a lot, which is why I'm giving this considerable thought again.  I don't have a lot of time left, as the college I most want to attend wants an answer by March 31st.  I feel like it's a tremendous opportunity for growth, both personally and professionally.  But I understand that he probably feels he's gotten me to a stabler place and doesn't want to rock the boat too much with a big move.  I just feel like I'd be wasting my time with the Master's degree if I just stay in my comfort zone and go to the local school though, where it's a crapshoot over what kind of job I'll get afterwards.  

I feel that I've learned to be my own rock in a lot of ways, and I've learned to reach out to friends and my father when I'm struggling rather than keeping it bottled in.  The move is definitely scary, but I know why I'm there, I know I'm going to learn the right skills for employment after I graduate, and I feel pretty motivated to succeed at the program (and in general, I love learning and being in school).

I'm not sure why I'm posting this, because people on the forum here don't know my whole story as well as my therapist and some people in my personal life.  I guess I'm interested to hear about how other people dealt with a big disagreement with their therapist.

I haven't even been accepted yet to the one good local program, so this may not even be an option.  The program I'd like to attend across the country has an online version of the degree, but I'd much rather attend in person and be in the classroom.  Office hours were crucial to me doing well in my undergraduate degree, and I'm afraid I wouldn't do well in the program without that assistance.",02Mar2017,1

&gt;thought broadcasting (feeling people can read my thoughts. I know they can't actually but is still stressful)

&gt;feeling like things aren't real, e.g - a room is just a box. Sometimes intensified by wearing glasses not contacts. 

&gt;thoughts that I don't like and disturb me such as sexual thoughts about peers even if I don't like them. 

&gt;been pretty tired lately. Low motivation and concentration. Sometimes memory. 

&gt;sometimes afraid of paranormal, I've had some really bad episodes in the past after reading horror stories such as goatman. 

&gt;anxiety around my breathing being too loud or fast so people can tell I'm nervous

&gt;sometimes feel I am pretending in my interactions with people (more than I used to). Sometimes I smile for too long as a result

&gt;accidentally saying things to myself I don't like. Such as 'I'm eating my bread like a good little girl' even though I'm a guy. Things that I would get mad at anyone else for saying. Though it should be noted I'm trans. 

&gt;occasional lack of clarity. Very rarely, when tired and dizzy, nonsense thoughts. Such 'he doesn't like me because I have to differentiate lnx and what if I do sinx + cosx and cos^2(x) - sin^2(x). A bit like an incredibly brief dream. 

&gt;one time a man walked in front of our car, he was Indian, but for a second I thought he was a killer clown, that image flashed in my mind for a split second and it was all I could see. Was anxious about clown people though, they were actually a problem in the uk for a while",02Mar2017,0

35,"Hi there, folks,

I'm using a throwaway account, which I suspect is pretty common. I'm looking for help, advice, and support in dealing with a difficult situation.

My significant other has always had a tumultuous relationship with their family. There was always a low level, untalked about understanding that there had been some abuse in the past, but it was never disclosed.

Over the course of the last few months they have become more and more certain that the abuse was pervasive, long lasting, and organized. I'm absolutely supportive of them coming to grips with their past and helping them pursue legal avenues.

The problem is that this journey has made them increasingly paranoid. They believe our home is bugged, and that we're being watched at all times. That our lives are in danger. That their family aren't their blood relatives, but that they was abducted at birth and her ""true"" family was murdered. That's just the tip of the iceberg.

They have a therapist that they've seen for a long time, but he's admitted to us both that he's out of his depth. We're pursuing more therapists and professional help, but her PPD is making it difficult or impossible to help them. They'll agree with me when I discuss things we need to do, steps we need to take, but as soon as I'm out of the room they go right back to doing what they want. They aren't sleeping. They call the police regularly.

What can I do here? How do I help someone who is so paranoid they assume the police can't be trusted and anyone they talk to outside of three or four people has been bought off and is a risk?",02Mar2017,1
