0,"I've recently had a problem with people's faces changing. When I say changing it's more like I can't recognise the persons face and I get confused and zone out. Its hard to describe as it feels like I'm not really there but all I can focus on is the face as if I'm trying to remember who they are. It's happening more frequently and last night it happened at a very awkward time. 

It's incredibly jarring because it strikes without warning. It usually lasts maybe 10-20 seconds but after it happens I feel incredible drained/tired. I've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder.  I'm not sure if this could be connected to that.  I'm a 23 year old female if that means anything. ",04Sep2017,8
1,"I just need to vent a bit. 2 months ago my dad had part of his toe amputated. That's how we knew he has diabetes. We've been learning on how to deal with this illness and it has been complex as we never imagined this but somehow we're moving ahead and learning still to manage this. However...

Today in the morning he was with low sugar and he was weak because of it and also with a odd and unhealthy mood. I saw him and I was very afraid as it's always though seeing a loved one in such situation. He seemed like drunk and then somehow lost and then he was drooling a bit and I guess I was very afraid and nervious. I gave him some cookies and juice and he improved but still 

This has made me anxious. A lot. I have been cleaning his open wound and lemme tell you is gruesome seeing but still easier to see than the mood I saw on him in morning - almost as if he was about to die or dunno just so sad and helpless seeing 

I was already an anxious person and I used to worry a lot and now with this I'm doing my best to keep myself calmed but is hard.  Aside from this issue - I have been unemployed and in a way I am thankful I'm able to look after him since I'm a single child and he has no family here and my mom has kept all afloat with her little business she attends but at the same time I am pressed as I am not someone with many friends and I am somehow feeling this is eating me up a bit. My boyfriend left me and makes me feel stupid as I lasted 10 years with him waiting in the end for nothing [i think he saw this as a chance to jump out of the wagon as now I have to look out more on my dad.. he's ghosting me since 3 months now] so yeah

I am feeling my life sucks as I'm 31 with no job a hard life ahead no close friends and not with someone anymore so yeah on top of this now my dads illness is well - manageable as I am aware there are way worse illnesses and situations but still I was so afraid as I saw him like that in the morning... why is life like this though? It hurts so much seeing your loved ones and life crumble just like this. I am trying to keep sanity as I don't wanna fall ill out of pure stress or anxiety and as I have zero money to pay on a psychological treatment well here I am throwing this on here. Money is also a struggle on this moments as well so it doesn't make it easier at all. I also have many panic as eventually I must do enough money so I am able to maintain both and well I am thinking is just too much stress when I think in how the situation is now..

Any advice on how to keep my cool or my brain sane or how to give a sugar boost to my dad during his sleep in nights in a harmless way is appreciated in advance - a lot 

And please... avoid any comments regarding religions I'm not a believer.

Thank you for your time reading this am I'm sorry I'm just a weakass üôè

Sorry when this is not clear as well my head is just brainstorming with anxiety

2,"Lately my mental health has been taking an absolute beating. I have thoughts I don't wish to have, and as I grow older the more I realise how morbid life really is. I have not been diagnosed with depression, however I went to get help and I just felt like the psych didn't really help me at all, because generally psych's can't really give advice, they just have to sit there, listen, and ask the right questions so that you can eventually figure it out and help yourself. I feel like I already constantly ask myself questions and constantly try to help myself to the best of my ability -- but I just can't figure out the answers. 

I find that the only way to really get over what i'm going though is to simply ignore it. I'm a very reflective and self aware person, and I just don't really feel as though these characteristics are benefiting me much at all because I'm realising as time goes on that I'm just really unhappy with my life and I can't seem to change things. 

What I've been realising lately is that I don't really want anything enough. I can think of all these things that could possibly benefit myself and make me fulfilled but when I really ask myself why do I want it, I cannot come up with an answer that is satisfactory and therefore I think, well then, what's the point? Let's just say for example, alright what do I want - well, to look good, loose some weight, fit into nice clothes, and feel comfortable in certain clothes. Why? Um, to feel a bit better about myself, to not think I'm fat and generally just look and feel better. Okay how? Well, gotta go to the gym, gotta eat better, gotta be patient. Hmm, so how long is that gonna take? Well, it's more of a lifestyle choice, otherwise after the set time is up, you'll go back right to where you started again. True, well, shit that's a big commitment isn't it? Is it worth it? I don't know. I really don't know. Is it going to make me feel that much better about myself? Is putting in all that hard work, really going to be worth the few seconds of ""yay I look better"" moment.

Is there really that much point to anything at the end of the day? I mean, sure it would be nice to loose some weight, but why the heck don't I want it enough to do anything about it? Why don't I really want anything that bad? If I wanted something bad enough, i'd love to go and get it. But I just have a lot of things that I think 'yeah that would be nice to have' but I don't desire it, and I think that's what's making me feel hopeless because as terrible as it sounds, I can't be fucked to try because it just doesn't seem worth all the hard work -- the end result or even the journey seems like a waste of time. 

And yes, it's probably better to work towards something than not, but I just wish I wanted something so bad. I just don't, I just can't think of anything that I'm dying to do, it just doesn't seem like it would be much of a reward, like doing it just doesn't seem worth it. 

Additional information: I'm a 23yo female, I work in a dead end job that pays me terribly and I dread going to, I have an awesome boyfriend (25yo) and he's also tired of the daily grind and we just both can't figure out how to make shit better. I have a lot of hobbies and interests, but again nothing that makes me go wow I really want that or really want to get there. I've almost got too many options and no idea how to get far with any of them and I just don't seem to have the drive for any of it, or the motivation to get out of this job. My life is this terrible job, and everything has to work around it, and that thought alone is so incredibly depressing.  

tldr: I feel so stuck because I just don't want anything enough to do anything about improving myself and my life. I just want to want it, but I just don't. I wish I had the desire to just do something to help myself and make a change.

There's just so much more that's going on but this is the main issue I feel.",04Sep2017,15
3,"everything just seems fake to me. My family, friends, myself, and the whole universe just don't seem right anymore. I feel like I'm in an alternate universe 24/7. 
And tbh for split seconds everyday, I start to believe in weird shit that my brain makes up. When I was little I had an obsession with the numbers 5 and 10. Idfk. And a year ago I had a thought that ""Only phrases with 5 or 10 syllables are true"". But I really really believe it at certain parts of the day, as if someone flipped a switch in my brain that believed it. And yesterday I saw a little black dot in my water and thought ""someone poisoned it"" and I slowly spit it back into my cup. It's like my brain is taking over. I don't know what's going on with me. It's almost like my brain has the steering wheel. 

I don't feel connected to anyone around me. Even my own family. It's like they're different people.


The only time when this stops is when something I remember from preschool that is still present to this day. Only preschool memories. though. I remember laying on my moms bed and looked at the ceiling and saw a crack. That ceiling crack was there ever since we got the house and just looking at it restored the feeling of being connected to my family. Another time I was watching Barbie rapunzel, and again felt that restoration of connection and reality to who I was. Like another piece of the puzzle was added. But this sense of reality goes away again, when I wake up in the morning. Does anyone know what's happening to me? Should I get help? 


It's just everything thing is SHIT. Nothing is real. I forget most of what I say, do, and see. EXCEPT things that are nostalgic. And I don't feel like I know anyone or can trust anyone :(",04Sep2017,3
4,"Hello,

I have bipolar 2. I was misdiagnosed three years ago with depression, but got the new diagnosis about a month or two ago. After that, my therapist has been a massive help. I feel like I am usually more in control of my emotions and behaviour.


A month ago, I moved in with a friend of 6 years. They were recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and went through almost a decade of sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of a paramour. They are seeking professional help to some extent, and are doing better now. I care for my friend and want to be there for them, but their behavioural patterns are beginning to take a big toll on my own mental health. They are highly self-centred and everything I do from bathing to socialising apparently *must* happen to suit their schedule. They are stubborn and make me out to seem like a bad guy if they don't have their way. Reasoning does nothing. To top this, they are beginning to lose sight of their end-goal of getting better and are falling back into destructive patterns. They have alienated nearly everybody else in our circles, and have counselling sessions only once in 20 days. 


What am I supposed to do in this situation? On one hand, I see my friend slowly drowning, and I want to jump in and help. On the other hand, I am fully aware of needing to keep my own self afloat. I see myself slipping away from all the frustration and I know I need an out. I have begun looking for other apartments. My counsellor, obviously concerned only with my health and not my friend's, backs my decision. Our friends do, too, but also have no idea what to do to help my friend.


Have any of you lived with people that also have mental illnesses? What happened in your case? I would greatly appreciate any insight or personal accounts, I could stand to learn from them.",04Sep2017,2

I tried meditating, praying, subliminal messaging. I've looked all around the internet for a solution I'm scared to think about anything now because whatever I think I know ill think about the dream along with it.

For example, I really don't like to go to the mall or any store or public place when I know it's going to be busy because I get anxious and frustrated around big crowds. But I still go and when I put myself in those situations, I feel more annoyed and angry and impatient and wanting to get out of the situation. I don't know if I'm just impatient and have an anger issue or if I may have something more along the lines of an anxiety disorder. I know I should see a doctor, which I plan on looking into.

My coping mechanisms are designed based on the short term, I'm having difficulty adjusting to the longevity of this one. 

I was wondering what you guys do to control yours? How do you stay productive when you feel bad?

16,"Hi guys. So throughout my teen years until now, I've been experiencing a few things that I am worried about. Essentially here is just a list of things that I've noticed:

- On some random day, I randomly get into this depressive episode where I am disinterested in talking and life in general. This would go on for a few hours and then go away suddenly.

- Whenever I do even the slightest thing wrong, I bash myself in the worse way possible. I am essentially my own personal bully. I often say to myself that I don't understand anything, I can't do anything and much more.

- I am can randomly be socially anxious at times. At these times, I feel like trembling and want to cry (sometimes I feel sick in the stomach). 

The main reason that I am worried is that usually self-confident and extroverted self always comes through, and there are days where I am the complete opposite of that. It doesn't help that I internalise any feelings that are not positive :/ Sorry for the block of text.",04Sep2017,0

20,"So I have a second personality named Seth and we typically get along and play games. We grew up together since we were 5. It was cool because we both excelled in different areas of life and would work together. Although lately we have been feuding over the control of this vessel. The switches are more occurring and lasting longer. We use to work together and remain in contact in the ""in between"" for lack of better words. Now we are trying to pursue two different careers and are talking to two different women. We are leading two different lives and it's getting harder to sit and watch the screen show me what he's doing. See when we switch and during the ""in between"" it's like sitting inside the body watching the world unfold without control of what the body does. Although able to remain in contact with him. He isn't evil or want to hurt people. We just cannot decide what the best way to deal with growing up and wanting to peruse a life we are proud of even though we are polar opposite people. Where I excel in math and science. Seth is amazing with history and English. Between both of us our memory is nearly photographic (identical). It's a hush topic between the family and our friends don't know because I don't talk to his and him to mine. It just makes life difficult being one half of a vessel and living two full lives.

23,"
My name is Sarah (UK) I have a condition that you probably won't have heard of called PMDD - Pre-menstrual Dysphoric Disorder (bit of a mouthful I know!) in the UK it is known as severe PMS. 

Basically my menstrual cycle/time of the month causes me to have BI-POLAR like symptoms. I have experienced depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, social anxiety, mania, psychosis/ delusional thoughts...I became a different version of myself. 

But when I bleed, my symptoms often go away. It is between ovulation and the bleed that I would be very unwell. 

I am on a mission to raise awareness of this condition and to encourage psychiatrists to ask women patients who potentially have a diagnosis of bipolar to TRACK their symptoms against their cycle. (CLUE app is good) It is only when you do this that you can start to rule out whether or not your mood changes/ changes to personality etc are in fact triggered by your hormone cycle. 

I have been down many treatment options over the years and am getting closer to being potentially cured of the condition. 
There is SUPPORT out there - groups on Facebook etc.. and if you google the condition you will find more info too! 

So if you have experienced any of these symptoms I would recommend tracking your cycle, it could explain a lot of things. 

Hope this helps. Any more info, please comment or message me.

28,"I'm writing this in hopes of getting some advice on how to better my relationship with my mom because I truly do not know what to do anymore..

I'm not sure where I should start, but I guess I'll give a little background information and then go to present day.

My mom was a single parent raising me, but she received enormous help from my grandparents. My grandma basically took care of me mostly while my mom was at work. Overall I had a good childhood. I probably watched a little too much tv, but I knew I was loved and I played outside a lot. I did have support, but as I got older the support turned more into strings trying to keep me at home instead of stretching my wings. I realized as I got older though my mom was/is extremely emotinally abusive &amp; I think it stems from her childhood. She was abused both physically &amp; mentally. After my father had left her when she was pregnant with me it added to the mental instability. She called me the devil's child, did the old I brought you into this world and I can take you out line, yelled at me over the smallest of things (spilling a drink, accidently knocking something over, etc) and sometimes she would get physically abusive but that would be once in a while, not all the time. Things started to get really bad after I had a major accident that left me in the hospital for a few days. After that she had a really hard time letting me go anywhere and she held me back a lot. I want to point out I was never a bad kid. I never stayed out later than I was suppose to, never did drugs, never got drunk, I listened to her, I was an honor roll student and I was in activites such as band/student council. All I ever wanted though was to stretch my wings and fly so to say. After I turned 18 throughout the years I went on a few trips, and everytime I left she would tell me, ‚ÄúWell I hope you don't die.‚Äù or something a long the lines like that and then just leave. She always through a fit when I would leave, and cry to make me feel back because I was risking my life each time I wanted to go somewhere. I was always left crying. Anytime I have tried to talk to her about my feelings she turns it around that she's the victim and I am the person causing all the drama and there's something wrong with me &amp; I need therapy. Over the years I have numerous conversations with my husband who has witness her first hand numerous times and he keeps assuirng me that it's not me. 

I have realized I can't talk with my mom. When I have tried to talk to her she gets really aggressive &amp; abusive. She'll leave voicemails screaming at me, or trying to guilt me by saying my dead grandparents would be so disappointed in me and I need to treat her better. She's made me feel guilty vising my grandparents grave because she thinks I do it because I feel gulity that I didn't spend enough time with them &amp; I shouldn't cry over their grave... when it's just that I miss them, and I don't have any guilt with them. Anyways... I'm now almost 30 and a new mom, so I now have more responsiblities on my shouders. I want to keep mentally healthy but I feel like my mom keeps tryng to break me. I had an episode last week where some medicine caused a bad reaction when I was at the dentist and I felt like I was having a heart attack. EMT was called and all that jazz, but I'm ok. But I haven't told my mom. My mom is a very nervous person and she makes stressful situations worse and somehow always wants to turn the attention to her. I keep thinking I should tell her, but I honestly don't want to. She always scared me into making sure I told her the truth or I would be in deep trouble business, so to this day I struggle with not telling her something when I don't want to. With that being said this weekend I've needed time to myself to try to feel better and mentally feel better. She was very angry with me that I didn't want to do anything for Labor day and again started to attack me. I made sure to tell her I just wasn't feeling good and I needed to be alone, then she goes on about how she doesn't feel good and that she was always there for me and blah blah blah... and then guilts me again about how my dead grandparents would be disappointed in me in how I treat her. 


One last thing is just she just doesn't respect me as an adult. I have asked her numerous of times not to buy us stuff &amp; explain to her that I'm trying to living as minimalistic as possible to help with stress and she just doesn't seem to care. I understand now that buying stuff is her love language. It's just ridiculous though because she'll always start a conversation with ‚ÄúI know you said not to buy anything, but I had to buy this because ‚Ä¶.‚Äù so she just blantly doesn't care what I say. 

I just don't know what to do anymore... I feel like I shouldn't have a relationship with her, but she's my mom and I do want to try to have a relationship with her. I know I haven't always been perfect about things, and I always apologize and try to explain myself but she then just gloats about it... it's all driving me absolutly insane! I could go on and on... 

So... does anyone have any tips on how I can have a relationship with my mom but also protect myself?I want my son to know his grandmother, but this can't keep going on like it has been...

Also, I apologize in advance for grammar/spelling... I'm writing this in a bit of a hurry because my son is hungry, lol. 

Thank-you for reading &amp; for any advice you can give &lt;3

It's like she doesn't understand social cues, however at other times she does seem to be considerate. She helps out people with her car to drop them off and stuff. She says random phrases she heard from somewhere again and again. Literally there is a specific one she has probably said a hundred times in the last month that makes no sense. She seems like shes lost something in her mind to me. But there are quite a few phrases like that. Her memory seems to not be that well. She forget to put things back or where she leaves things. However she does remember some random things here and there like to do something she is specifically asked to. She smokes a lot and she has been eating badly for a while. She is also drinking as I'm aware but I don't know if it's a significant amount.

This is really heartbreaking because she is someone I've loved so much for so long and I'm starting to feel no love for her because I've tried and tried but nothing seems to work. She becomes distant when talked to about these things or lashes out at my mother for example. She says inappropriate things and she doesn't dress appropriately either. She is causing a huge problem in the family and we are all somewhat being effected by it mentally.

We have asked for years now to go to the doctors or stop the smoking or tried to help her in many ways but nothing has worked. We can't force her to get mental help and I just want to know what we can do. What can you say is the problem with her and what can we do to get the real her back? ",04Sep2017,6
34,"I've been seeing a psychologist for the past eight months but found it really hard to open up and only told her as little as I could get away with. But last week I broke down. I was having suicidal thoughts every single day, 24/7, for four weeks &amp; the only thing keeping me alive was my parents - I'm an only child and it took ten years for my parents to finally be able to have a child. I couldn't do this to them. It would've been too selfish.

I finally opened up to my psychologist and let her know about the thoughts I was having and what was going through my mind and how frustrated I was feeling. I kept thinking that it would be better to be dead rather than live a life like this where I'm never happy and can't even go out because of my severe social anxiety - I get panic attacks just by thinking about being in a group of people and I've been delaying my exams for the past two years despite having finished my course long ago just because I can't sit in a group of students and no school is willing to let me take the exams alone.

She was very worried and kept trying to make me feel better and I told her that I do understand what she's saying but I can't think rationally when I'm having those thoughts.

She contacted my psychiatric and wrote her that she was worried about my health and that she needed to talk to me and help me.

Normally it's just me and her but today there was another psychiatric as well. I go there, for the first time I *kind of* open up - it's still hard for me to talk to my psychiatric because she's not very nice and quite blunt and has already threatened me multiple times that if I don't get well they will admit me to the mental ward. She starts by almost shouting at me and telling me that my psychologist is worried and that she doesn't understand why I'm feeling like this and why I am thinking of killing myself. This already made me very nervous but she kept talking and saying that meds alone don't do everything and that I have to help myself (I already know this, but if I knew HOW to help myself I would've done it years ago). After a while of talking, she starts telling me that she thinks that my condition (depression, severe social anxiety, and very frequent panic attacks) is giving me some kind of advantage and that's why I don't want to get out of it. I felt like crying and shouting at her at that point but I stayed calm and collected but once I came back home I self-harmed and cried a lot.

There's no advantage for me by staying in this condition. What am I gaining? I'm behind my peers academically wise (like I said before I've been avoiding giving exams for the past two years despite finishing my course), I can't meet my FRIEND (I only have one and it's my childhood friend) unless they come to my place or if I go to their place they have to send away all their family members, I can't get a license, I can't go grocery shopping, I can't have a job, I only get out of the house for medical visits and that too with my parents only, I can't even go on my own balcony because there are people outside, I can't do any of the things I had planned for myself when I was younger and that breaks my heart. 
I also depend on my parents for every little thing financially wise and non-financially wise too...and the stress that I must be causing them (they never say anything, just that I'm more important than anything else) is huge: they're spending a lot of money on my meds (the insurance I have doesn't cover them all and the one they cover isn't completely covered), weekly psychologist visits, bi-weekly psychiatric visits too - and this makes me FEEL SO GUILTY that I can't even explain. I feel like a burden. Everything about my condition is so shitty and I don't understand WHY a doctor especially a mental health one would even say this.

This is not the first time she was rude to me but previously I had told my psychologist that instead of making me feel at ease, my psychiatric makes me feel worse. After that, my psychologist wrote her an email and ask her to be nicer because she was making me uncomfortable. The visit after the email went well and she was extremely nice and today's visit completely broke my spirit. 

She did encourage me to get a license and that it's okay to be behind academically because it doesn't mean that I won't be EVER successful, just that it'll take longer but she ruined everything by saying that I'm gaining an advantage from my condition and that's why I'm getting worse instead of better. I just asked 'What kind of advantage?' and she said that she didn't know yet but there definitely must be one. After that, I just kept mum and listened to what she was telling me.

I'm sorry if this is too long but other than my dad I haven't confided in anyone about this and needed to get it out of my system. I need help in deciding what to do - should I report her to someone or is this behavior acceptable? Is what she said actually true? Is it possible to condition yourself to this point that you make your situation worse and worse despite wanting to get out of it? 

Honestly, there's no advantage for me. Like I said before there are tons of disadvantages that make me feel like my life has no point, I'm a waste of space and many other things like this. My parents are already the best parents one could ever ask for and they give me a lot of attention and fulfill my every wish. I just can't.... can't understand why would she say this.

Thank you to anyone who will reply and who actually read all of this. Means a lot to me.

I don't know if it matters but at the moment I'm taking three different meds:

1. **Alprazolam (Xanax)** - 10 drops, 3 times a day | Been taking this for two months.
1. **Zoloft (Sertraline)** - 100 mg, once a day | Been taking 50 mg of this for one month and a half, started 100 mg two weeks ago.
1. **Dalmadorm (Flurazepam)** - 15 mg, 30 minutes before going to bed | Been taking this for two weeks.

Again, thanks to anyone who will read this and reply and sorry for ranting so much.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who replied. It means a lot. I'll reply to each and one of you ASAP. ",04Sep2017,16
35,"Ok, I'll try to keep this short. Up until I was terminated from my job I was extremely social, heck I focused on public speaking in college (something I love to do). Since I was let go my stomach issues have become worse, basically any amount of oil makes me sick. This has caused me to develop social anxiety, which blows my mind. Basically any time I think about going anywhere (even over to family) I get worried about getting sick and make myself vomit. This week I have two in person interviews, both of which would be great jobs and I really want. I know if I can get through them I'll get the job(s). Any advice on how to do so? I just have to get my mind off of getting sick and I'm fine, but it's that part that's been hard. 

TLDR: I have job interviews and I've been getting sick when I'm nervous.",04Sep2017,8
36,"I can't tell if Im having false memories or not. Lately i've been experienced of glimpses of dreams that I had when I was a kid but I can't tell if I actually had those dreams or not. Some of this imagery is sort of disturbing, but not in a conventional sense. It's nothing morbid or violent in the flashes of ""memories"" but it feels confusing and somewhat scary. Does anyone know what this is or how to help?",04Sep2017,13
37,"Hi all! 

I‚Äôm a 19 year-old artist and poet looking for real suicide notes or notes from those that have attempted. Why you ask? I‚Äôve written a poem about suicide and for my final piece I want the poem to be made from extracts of real notes to convey emotion that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt be if the poem was just hand-typed by myself. I understand that what I am asking for is a lot. If you would like to help me you can send a scanned copy or a high res photo of the note (doesnt have to be the full note) to suicidepoemproject@outlook.com. You are also welcome to email me questions. The notes can be completely confidential if you wish (not that I plan to give out the names of those who gave me the notes) I was thinking of a simple 'thank you to all who helped make my vision a reality and for sharing one of if not the most personal thing about yourself, I truly am humbled'. I want what works best for you. I also have my own website displaying my past works that have been displayed at exhibitions (just email me and I'll send you the link)

As someone with depression who's attempted before (I'm all better after years of therapy and medication) I want those who were in the same place as myself to realise that they're good enough. I want this to be a meaningful project that will hopefully save lives. Even if someone reads the poem and thinks 'I am good enough' then it will be fulfilling. 

Many thanks. 
your friend,

M

39,"I've had countless identity crisis‚Äô in my life. It seems to me that there is something buzzing around my mind searching for anything to call an identity, and I've been rejecting anything resembling such. Maybe it's due to being 20 years old with no social life to speak of. Maybe it's a reaction to the nauseating identity politics infecting people my age these days. Whatever that is buzzing around my head almost had a grip on me today. I drew a couple of pictures that I was quite proud of, and several other experiences got it in my head that I'm a creative person. The identity that came over me was ‚Äúartist.‚Äù For the time being I‚Äôm going to continue to reject any notion of an identity, especially the title of ‚Äúartist‚Äù because there seems to be safety there. Taking on a title is adding material to the ‚Äúself,‚Äù which will send a message to other people in turn giving me responsibilities that I may or may not be able to handle. This has been a problem in the past. In high school I would tell people of my enjoyment of physics, which is not a message you want to send having an IQ of around, and perhaps below 90. I will continue to make whatever it is that I call art, but I can‚Äôt tell anybody in my life about it for fear that I become responsible for it. I want to continue to be basically useless in the eyes of other people so that I can use a harsher judgemental perception for myself without social consequences. ",04Sep2017,2
