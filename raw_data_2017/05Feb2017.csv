0,"For about 3 years I have been having some problems with my mental health on and off, more on than off though. I will have bouts of depression, paranoia, anger, bitterness, envy, just all very negative emotions where I just hate everyone around me or I hate the person I am - for example, I hate how weak I am, especially in relationships, I hate how promiscuous I am, I hate how I have no willpower, no motivation, I'm lazy etc. I've been thinking about counselling for a long time as I feel like I would benefit from it but I'm just too embarrassed to talk to a complete stranger about my personal issues, I'm worried they'd judge me. I'm not very good vocalising my inner feelings, my mind gets really caught up in knots when I try to talk. I feel like I can truly express how I feel by writing it down because I can think about it better. Help?? Any suggestions? :/",05Feb2017,2

2,"I've made different posts before about this in the past few days/hours, but I'm not doing it for karma or anything else besides help or advice. I will type as though I'm talking with medical professionals even though I'm sure there aren't any here.

I'll get to what I want to talk about first, my mental health ever since Monday of this week has **plummeted** to put it lightly.

I'm 22, live with my mother and I have depression and an unspecified anxiety disorder (because my doctor didn't want to put a ""label"" on me) but I'm sure it's at least generalized anxiety disorder, I take Klonopin, Buspar and Celexa under prescription by my doctor. My anxiety has gone completely out of control and my Klonopin is doing next to nothing.

So I'm here to ask if *anyone* can tell me of a medication I can ask a doctor to prescribe to me to put my anxiety to tolerable levels, and unfortunately I'm too skeptical to try any of the non-medication treatment options. I truly am sorry if you don't think you can help or give advice, but I can't see a doctor until tomorrow.

I'm in no danger of hurting myself or anyone else around me, but I'm considering going to a mental hospital because I feel as though I can't get the treatment I need, but on the flip-side I don't want to go because I've heard horror stories about the places and they seem like a nightmare to go through and I'm not sure I'll make it out of there alive mentally.",05Feb2017,1

12,"From my point of view, the universe is deterministic and therefore nihilistic. I cope with this through avoidance, digital entertainment mainly. But every so often the thought comes back and I find myself in an existential crisis. I lose all motivation, and have suicidal urges. I have managed to make it through these periods my whole life, but I do not know if I can continue to do so. This lasts until I manage to distract myself again, which can take anywhere from a few hours to a week. Most of the time though, when I'm not in a crisis, I have no passion for anything other than consuming digital entertainment for a brief high in an otherwise miserable existence. I do not understand, I am an upper-middle class white male with nothing to worry about, but I am plagued by anxiety and depression. My problem is twofold. First, my basic state is misery. Second, I have periods of crisis that are even worse. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I'm being medicated. The medication helps, but even with it I am miserable. I hate the person I am without them: angry, scared, and sad. I have tried therapy, which helped to a point and then stopped working. I hate this, and I do not know what to do. I am sorry for rambling, and I hope this made sense.",06Feb2017,1
13,"How long does it really take?

I just find it so dissapointing where every session I measure my progress and don't see any at all. I literally just wait for it to kick in but it doesn't kick in. Are you supposed to even feel anything from therapy? And if it takes a ridiculously long time like 6+ months to improve just a little bit then what the hell is the point? Doesn't seem worth it to me. I want to see tangible improvement week to week if I am going to pay ~ $100 ish per session. 

I really don't have that kind of time to just wait for therapy to kick in. I'm already with a new therapist recently as of winter break so its been 6+ weeks and still nothing. This isn't my first therapist either but around my 4th.

And this is CBT btw.  ",06Feb2017,3
14,"My therapist gave me info about ""mistaken beliefs"": the idea that we develop ideas or theories that aren't true. I realized mine were thoughts I developed in childhood like, ""nobody cares about me, why should I (care about me)"", ""others' well-being is more important than mine"", and other thoughts that go along the lines of feeling worthless. 
I also realized that when I'm anything less than a 100% ok I hide, and that it was because I was shamed when I was a kid everytime I felt unwell. I have good friends, but I always hesitate to tell them when something is wrong in spite of needing help, because of the mistaken belief that I'll be shamed for it.

24,"Hello, Im here for some advice. 
Me and my girlfriend have been together for a few months now and she is a amazing strong person, however she has some issues regarding mental health that we want to work together in getting the treatment and help she needs.

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons and im not going to name names or locations for mine and her protection but i want to get across the severity of the situation and whats best to help her.

When she was younger there was some sexual abuse that has manifested with her to this day and i think that has had a huge part in her mental issues. She hears voices sometimes that she describes to me as a type of paranoia, it doesn't effect her so much but they are still around occasionally. 

The real worry for us is she tells me she feels like there is a different person there. We will go out and be find all week and one day she will suddenly be like a different person who knows who I am am but will be hostile and argumentative about allot of things.
She can snap out of it if she feels grounded to herself but in itself that is a worry and I want to help her in any way I can.

She is incredibly loving and strong and a amazing person, and I have to say she does not at all come across as mentally ill at a face to face level 99% of the time, but when this certain mood hits or whatever it is she can go a little ""Loopy"" -her words and we really want to find a way to work through this.  

One last thing is she has told me that once before in the past she has not remembered periods of time due to this ""Other person"" being on control I guess?? 

She is a fantastic girl, but allot has happened and she has had no support over the years to help her. 

What Can i do and we do to get her through this?

Please Help!!
 Please.

30,"I'm having a mental health assessment later this month but I just feel I'm losing my grip on reality by the day

This is what I'm going to tell them, I hope I can see a psychiatrist, sick of them guessing at treating me

[ ] Was in good, normal mood then went on reddit about BPD thing and related to it all and mood plummeted to believing I was crazy and that I'd never be fixed and saw myself in the negative symptoms listed like black and white thinking and having a favorite person I'm obsessed with - noticed by others

[ ] Swing wildly from depressed to ecstatic when ""favourite person"" gives me attention and am just happy they pay attention despite saying to myself that I'd begin to just write it off because they hadn't given me time of day - noticed by others

[ ] Extreme dependency on others for personal happiness - noticed by others

[ ] Extreme change in thoughts from hate to love for minor triggers, no shades of grey

[ ] Dissociation during stressful events - has led more than once to molestation and inaction

[ ] Constantly searching for some identity in other things - putting high stock in personality tests and getting upset when they don't match

[ ] Worrying about having personality disorders - having to admit I'm fundamentally flawed but kind of wanting a diagnosis to figure out what is wrong

[ ] Caught in the same loop of okay &gt; sad &gt; devastated &gt; ecstatic &gt; okay

[ ] Cannot sit with internal world or I constantly dwell on flaws OR I think I'm the best there is - doesn't seem to be an in-between

[ ] Have always downplayed symptoms at mental health checks or ""forgotten"" to mention some - shameful to mention to professionals

[ ] Constantly ask for validation from others - ask for good traits for affirmation and am preoccupied with being liked by others, even people that I don't like - this has been pointed out to me

[ ] I feel I've no foothold in my inner world, like my personality is constantly in flux - like I can't stick to one self - not multiple personalities because I'm still always myself, but who is me? Outgoing, friendly, charming, or cold hearted, manipulative and cunning? Have no sense of perception when it comes to myself

[ ] Mood swings vary from day to day and are triggered, but are completely overblown - being ignored and not replied to sends me suicidal

[ ] I know when I'm overreacting but I cannot sit with emotions - they are too strong and thoughts can't reframe my state of being, so eventually they end up shifting to match my turbulent emotions

[ ] Increasing urges for self destructive behaviour - resisting urges to mess with anti depressants and take too many or too few - have been wanting to self harm and often need to force myself to interact with others so I don't harm myself instead with my inner state

[ ] Mental health has worsened recently - all symptoms have always been present but I've never been able to gather all of them at once during an assessment because I always downplay my problems when it's time to see a doctor

[ ] Heavy feelings of emptiness and disconnection from others - only really able to connect when drinking",06Feb2017,1
31,"Depression, or 'the black dog' as it is better known, is an evil manipulator that will pollute an already fragile mind. A dark overcast will take control of your life, making the most simplest of tasks near on impossible. Take the mother out of About a Boy for instance, crying over a bowl of cereal. It may sound silly but it happens. You either cry too much or not at all, there is no in between. 

You are worthless - Depression chips away at your self-confidence. Your hopes and dreams will be shattered into a million pieces as you will become convinced that there is no point in trying as you will fail anyway. 

It is because of this that I contemplated quitting my undergraduate degree numerous times. My work was rubbish so what was the point in making myself poorly in order to reach deadlines? Wrong. With help and guidance I achieved a 2.1 overall, 0.6% off a first though (gutted!). 

You're a burden- A common one. You don't smile or laugh anymore. You sleep a lot, cancel plans, and have to be reminded to shower, eat and sleep. You're a grown adult, shouldn't you be doing these things for yourself? Wrong again. I know myself that during a bad dip I will revert to being a child in an adult's world. I will need reminding to wash my clothes and keep my flat tidy. 

I will need a telling off for eating chocolate, cereal and pot noodles as opposed to healthy, nutritious meals. Heck, sometimes my brother will even come round to do my cleaning for me as I struggle to summons the energy to scrape myself up off the sofa.

You don't deserve to be happy - You're a burden, weak and lazy, so why do you deserve the same level of happiness as those who aren't? Because you are you. You are a strong warrior, fighting the hardest battle of your life. If that isn't worthy of happiness then I don't know what is. 


This is your fault - For years I believed that this was my fault. If I hadn't been drinking that Martini I wouldn't of had those panic attacks. If I hadn't of left Asda I wouldn't have wound up agoraphobic. If I'd have stood up for myself in school I wouldn't have social anxiety - the list is endless. 
Sadly I do still blame my mum though, and I don't think that will ever change. A lot of mistakes were made by her that she failed to rectify. And then she passed away. 

You're lazy - I've been known to sleep for 19/24 hours. While chronic fatigue will take control of my body, I will still feel guilty for sleeping through the day while others are out working hard. If they can go to bed at a decent hour and make it through the day without a nap then why can't I? Because I'm poorly, that's why. You will rest up with flu or a stomach bug so why should it be any different with depression? 

While people understand the repercussions of physical illness, sadly the same can't be said for mental illness. There's that whole concept of 'it's all in your head'. Yes it may be psychological but it's both mentally and physically exhausting being at war with your own mind. 

Just envisage how tired you are following a day of reading or being sat behind a computer. Your mind has been working overtime in order to process the information before your eyes. Now take that level of fatigue and add in intrusive thoughts and anxiety - your mind never gets to rest.

Things will never get better - You won't be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel because there's a big wall blocking it - depression. 

You're weak - This is my mind and my body so shouldn't I be in control of it? No. People living with mental illness are the strongest of them all. There is nothing scarier than being at war with your mind. You are inclined to believe the thoughts crossing your mind because you are the one who created them but that isn't exactly true.

You're alone - Nobody cares or understands. You're the only one to have ever been through this. Your brain is wired differently. God, the list is endless. Let me tell you this, I've been there and I am still there.

When I was first diagnosed with anxiety I was beyond terrified. I instantly reverted from being a social butterfly to a nervous wreck almost overnight. I can recall sending out a Facebook SOS, asking whether anyone else had anxiety, and had taken the beta blockers that I was on at the time. I wanted success stories, but mostly a magic cure. 

I am alone in my fight with depersonalisation disorder though due to it being such a rare condition. Yes I can reach out to people on support groups via message but I can't turn to those surrounding me because they can't empathise in the slightest. And explaining it to supposed professionals, well, don't get me started. 

What I can say though is that, whatever you do, please use reliable sources. Wikipedia will leave you convinced that you'll wind or sectioned or a mass murderer. I will often access Mind and read related books - Claire Weakes is a good one. Oh and Susan Jeffers.

Suicidal ideation - An iffy subject. I've made no secret of the fact that I'm suicidal and that I have attempted to take my own life. I would be a pretty crappy blogger if I wasn't totally honest with my readers. 

Numerous times I've reached out and said that, given half a chance, I would take my own life in a heartbeat. I'm sick of always being the strong one, and I'm sick of fighting. 

If you are going through something similar please reach out and tell someone. And visit your doctor or A and E if you feel you're a danger to yourself or others.

34,"Hello glorious people of reddit. I have a very mysterious problem which makes no sense to me what so ever, and I really wanna know what's going on, if there is anything to explain this with. Yesterday, Feb. 5th, at right around 9:18 pm, I was in a skype call with 5 other people. I was talking to them, and we were just looking up random phobia's that didn't make much sense to us. (We weren't laughing at them we were just kinda looking for ones that were either super obscure or ones that didn't seem like you could live, like the fear of everything, or the fear of rooms.) When suddenly, 1 friend dropped out of the call stating ""Sudden Depression"" this friend had just been introduced to a new person, so we assumed that might be the cause, or at least, I did, because before I could voice my opinion, one of my friends who had met this new person before, also stated that she had the same feeling, and 5 min. later left the call as well. There were now only 3 others in the call, besides me. One of them, who worked in some kind of store that sold random stuff to put in your house, and he often had to deal with new people and was quite fine with it, but he also cited random depression seconds after the other two did, and stayed in the call, just not talking, and using typing to continue being part of the conversation before leaving as well. This also didn't seem to have specifically a impact on all people with depression, as one of the two remaining people in the call had depression, but so did everyone else who left the call (It's really a friend group full of people who aren't 100% really, I have dpd, and the other person we just added has a list of phobias that at a 10 point font it fills up 4 pages on a word doc) and that one friend stayed mildly active (Due to them playing a game) throughout the rest of the call. This honestly confused me however. Why did 3 people at the same time without communicating to each other get depression for no reason? I can't think of anything, and nothing I look for online seems to come up with anything, so, Reddit, do what you do best, please, if you've got one, give me some reasoning. ",06Feb2017,0
35,"Hey, I don't know how to begin this so here it goes. I've never been able to really describe this, so I can't google symptoms which makes me feel even more like I'm going crazy. Along with feeling worthless/etc, (like depression, but I've never been to a psychiatrist because I don't want my parents to be worried) I feel like I act very differently in new situations and around different people, like I'm not there. My eyes glaze over, I don't talk like myself. I feel like I'm a form of consciousness trapped inside a vessel; two beings seperate from each other trying to cooperate in order to appear normal, and not like a pathetic idiot to others. I'll do something stupid, and lament over it for as long as I can.

38,"I've been in love with this girl for the past year. We've been close friends the whole time. Recently we've started a sort of friends with benefits relationship, and for the first time in a long time I'm actually happy. Somewhat. When we're not together we're always texting but as busy people, she's not always able to text back right away. Instantly my first thought is always, ""what if she died"". Even if she's at school or at work or told me she's doing something, I still can't get the fear out of my head. I'll initially try to push it out of my mind and take what she said she's doing at face value, but then I start second guessing and it consumes my entire thoughts. I'm fucking terrified. I've told her about it and she said she understands and appreciates my concern and that there's nothing to worry about. She tells me she'll be ok, promises to stay safe etc etc, and that works only briefly. Instantly I start considering a hundred thousand other potential scenarios where something nether of us can control happening, like a car accident or a random shooting or anything. We've had a complicated relationship so far, too complicated to detail everything here, but the gist of it is this. Every time prior to this one where we've made plans to have a relationship like this or where we confess our feelings to each other hasn't worked out. It's always ended in heartbreak and us taking a break from talking. But this time seems to be really working out, something I am not at all hard to. When I try to use reason and tell myself that nothing's happened, I chalk it up to me not being used to things working out. I feel as though I'm so scared of things falling apart again that I start coming up with any reason why they would, and then convince myself that's what happened. I constantly am worried about this, in every situation. I feel like if I let my guard down and accept the fact that she's ok and will most likely be ok, I'll be causing something bad to happen to her. I don't want to imagine life without her yet that's all I can think about. If anyone can offer any sort of advice I would really appreciate it. I don't want to live this way, constantly in fear, yet whenever I try to stop it, I start thinking, ""what if"" again. I know my worrying won't prevent any sort of unforeseen things happening but I can't stop it anyway. ",06Feb2017,2

44,"I'll begin by saying I've already been to my PCP and told her about my fears. She's been my doctor for about 5 years so knows my medical history, and I don't have any history of alzheimer's or dementia, or other memory-related mental illnesses. But she ran me through a battery of tests which were basic memory tests, and I passed and she said she saw no reason for worry, and attributed my recent memory lapses to stress, since I haven't had any blows to the head or any other symptoms like headaches or mood swings. 

But I don't know if it is. I'm freaking out. Something isn't right.

I've been at my job about 3 years, and it's not overly stressful. And I just went back to school part-time to get another BA, which has added a bit of strain to my personal life since I have less time to spend with my boyfriend - but again, not really stress-inducing. 

But the last month or so, I've become completely forgetful about the most mundane things. 

Like this weekend my boyfriend and I were going to a Super Bowl party and I told the host I'd bring mac &amp; cheese balls. Sunday morning I went to the store to pick up ingredients. But when I got home I couldn't find the bread crumbs I know I bought - they were on the receipt. So had to rush back to the store to buy more. After I finish making them I put the can of bread crumbs in the cupboard and there is the brand new can I bought earlier. I know I looked in there and absolutely did not see it. 

Or another time we had tickets to this somewhat upscale party hosted by one of my clients. Not usually our scene, but just an excuse to get dressed up and feel fancy. Before we left the apartment I remember handing the tickets to my boyfriend because they wouldn't fit in my stupid little clutch. But we got to the check-in at the party my boyfriend swears up and down I didn't hand him the tickets, and am I sure I pulled them out of my work portfolio. They let us in since we're on the list. But when I got home and checked my portfolio, there were the tickets. 

And a bunch of other random stupid little things. Like forgetting to turn the clothes dryer on. Or not turning off my hair straightener (even though I used to always not only turn it off but unplug it). Or finding my house keys or work cellphone in the most random places around our apartment even though I have a little tray by the front door that I usually put them in first thing when I get home. 

My boyfriend has noticed all this, and agreed with the doctor that it could be stress related. But I don't *feel* stressed, at least I didn't before I started forgetting everything. Luckily my forgetfulness hasn't seeped into my work or school life, but I'm so worried about messing up something big. I talked to my brother (who is pretty much my bestfriend) and he lovingly, in his best ""Kindergarten Cop"" impression said *""it might be a tumor"".* I laughed, but now I'm freaking out that it might be, and should go back to my doctor. 

I don't know what I hoped to gain by posting this. I just feel so scared.

52,"I am not living.

I am a teenager currently doing A-Levels in the UK, patiently waiting for adulthood to wreak havoc on my brittle mind and body. I have applied for multiple universities already; a forced, uninspiring task. Before I begin, I would like to stress that I am aware my life, though unprivileged in the community I am in, will be a dream for someone else and I simply wish to use this platform as a component of relief.

I suffer from severe depression and there are a few things I would like to address. In my college, I know that the teachers value me less as a human being due to my grades. They fluctuate, you see. Some weeks I am consumed by suicidal tendencies, whereas others I am ready to learn. Recently more than usual, however, I have noticed their enhanced disgust and pity. I am surrounded by Russell Group applicants, but as a result of my predicted grades, I was assured no notable university would want me. Because of this, it appears those around me have accepted me as if I am a devolved version of themselves, a useless body contributing nothing meaningful to society. I know this sounds obscure, but I promise you this is the way I, and many others, feel. I am treated like a moronic cave dweller. What makes it worse is I believe I have a solid, rational view of the world so when adults look down at me as if I am an ant, I am angered and emit an emotionless and careless attitude. 

It's very to use the term 'depression' lightly and nonchalantly, it's stigmatised and overlooked. At so many moments I have just wanted to scream: ""Apologies for failing, last night I had pills in hand ready to poison my worthless body, the topic of history wasn't particularly at the forefront of my mind."" And of course, I can completely fathom that I do not deserve special treatment, but at least a little more understanding since 1 in 4 people in the UK are experiencing the same feeling as if one is deteriorating, the same acceptance of defeat and fatigue. Along with depression, I feel as if depersonalisation is a problem for me as well. Sometimes I feel actions have no consequence because I don't exist or as if I am in a bubble where sounds whir and soften as my sight blurs. Any connection I have with an object, environment or person dissipates and I'm alone. I feel as if I am a just a brain within a skull, floating and trapped with my own deteriorating thoughts.

What I have noticed in addition is that politicians are usually well or privately educated and whilst being a high achiever with depression exists, it's not as common. Therefore the likelihood of coming across an influential figure with a mental health issue is low, meaning, once again, mental health in government is forgotten and camouflaged and in turn, ignored. Not only this, for some reason other students find the concept of depression relatable and humorous. Though I do not know what is occurring in their personal lives, I am still slightly irritated when a successful, emotionally healthy student attempts to connect with me by lying (perhaps I am jealous). I, of course, don't enjoy having a dismal outlook on life and I desperately want to improve. 

I am not living, I feel utterly decomposed.",06Feb2017,3
53,"Hey, hopefully someome in this community might have some experience with this.

I am posting using a throwaway, because I'm paranoid, go figure!

I am 26 years old now.

As I get older, it seems I'm growing more paranoid, at least, I think that's what's happening. 

Some examples of recent things that I have done or thought:

1) I have accused my fiance of cheating at least 10 times in the last year, but when I strain my memory I can't come up with a single peice of evidence, not even circumstantial. She is, of course, getting fed up with me.

2) My heart races and I get nervous when I get a phone call, not because I'm nervous to talk on the phone, but because I wonder if it is the police or FBI calling to accuse me of a crime, even though I know I've haven't done anything. 

3) When I get mail from, say, my cable provider, I think they will accuse me of hacking or something I don't even know how to do. Of course it's always just a bill.

4) Everytime I come into work and check my emails my heart races thinking I'll be fired for negligence even though I've never neglected my duties.

5) Like a lot of people I've indulged in conspiracy theories, but as I look back now at what I'm starting to take seriously, I realize it is bordering on delusion. 
For example the idea that there is an underground satan worshiping cult in the government.

I was going to ask if this is normal but after typing it all out I realize it's definitely not.",06Feb2017,1
