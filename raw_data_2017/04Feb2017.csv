1,"Usually I manage my mental health alright. There are a lot of ups and downs but normally I find ways to cope.

But there are days where it's really bad and I can never figure out why. It's usually completely out of the blue and has no warning. I wake up and know I won't be able to do anything that day. I end up lying on the couch on my phone (or just doing nothing) for hours. I can't leave my house and I don't feel like doing anything. 

Everything feels incredibly heavy, I feel utterly disconnected from everyone and completely alone, and that weird ""I'm right on the verge of tears"" feeling. Anything can push me over the edge. It's like an actual physical pain that lasts for hours. Then there's the usual wave of dangerously negative thoughts I can't distract myself from. I feel like I'm underplaying the severity of how bad it feels but there's the gist of it. 

Does anyone have similar experiences and how to cope when you feel this way? Anything effective to distract yourself or control the emotions until they pass?
Thanks all. ",04Feb2017,25
2,"Hope this is the right place, and I'll try to make this short and to the point. 

I was raised by both of my grandparents, so in essence they were my parents. After high school my grandpa's Alzheimer's was rapidly progressing. I stayed with them to help my grandmother care for him for several years before leaving for college. After discussing it with then, they both agreed that I should go and live my own life. 

One year after I left my grandfather died. I had only seen him once in that year and can admit that I don't deal with death well. I was devastated for several years and felt immense guilt for leaving. My grandmother moved in with my aunt and was neglected (lost dentures that were never replaced, filthy house, bugs). It made me so sad when I would go and see her which I did more often once I moved back to the same state. But, three years later she suffered a severe stroke. I went to see her at the hospital and was alone with her for an extended period of time (uncles went to get some food). This was extremely hard for me to see her like this and pretend to be strong...I broke down and started crying in front of her. She held my hand and wouldn't let go...all I wanted to do was leave, so I pulled away from her. Told her I loved her and had to go...and I left. She died the next day...

Well, 8 years later and I still feel so much guilt over not staying there with her, but I was selfish and couldn't stay. It feels better to share this, but does anybody have advice on resolution or letting go of something like this?

Thanks for reading all of this.",04Feb2017,1

8,"So recently (one month) I've began working at this huge senior community clubhouse/lodge for residents who live nearby. The lodge sits alone about 2 miles from any homes. I'm doing overnight maintenance and floor polishing from 9pm to 5:30am. Anyway, I work all alone and have recently become extremely paranoid. if I don't have any music playing it's too quiet and I become very scared. I start imagining it's haunted or someone is watching me from outside the big black windows, but than if I have the music playing too loud, I feel the same way. The first couple weeks were fine because I knew there was a co-worker doing the floor polishing on the other side of the building and new I wasn't alone. Since she moved to another shift, due to the fact I can handle it by myself, I haven't felt right. So question, am I developing some sort of mental illness or is this normal for some people to get very scared being alone at night? I've never experienced such fear and I know I'm not a wacko or schizo, etc. because before I get to work and after I leave, I feel completely normal again and have normal thoughts. It's only being alone at work...at night Thanks

10,"I'm really struggling with a depressive phase in Bipolar || ... anybody have any tips to help me feel a little better? Honestly NOTHING has helped, I feel like I can't enjoy anything anymore. I'm on two different anti-depressants so where do I go from here..?",04Feb2017,1
11,"[Initial post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5r9nue/wife_checked_herself_into_an_inpatient_behavioral/?utm_content=thumbnail&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage)

So my wife has been inside for four days.  She's called every night after dinner and we've talked for 30 min to an hour each time.  She seems to be making progress, and sounds like she is much happier and upbeat when we talk, but it's clear that the separation is straining her too.  She's made friends, talked about issues, her doctor put her on a med for anxiety, then a med for depression that also helps her with the neuropathy pain she experiences, so that's good.  

Myself, I have been numb.  Just numb to the whole thing, and when I talked my mind off this giant mountain of emotion, I can laugh a little bit.  But the conversation will eventually drift back to something she did or said or a hobby we used to share.  And then I'm right back to weeping.  I haven't had a good cry about this situation yet, sobbing and bawling, snot all down my face, can't speak inteligiblely. But it is getting better for me.  I'm accepting that this is not a betrayal, it is a great trust placed in me... well, starting to accept.  It's still a little raw.  

But I am feeling even more that I did the right thing.  She researched the hospital, researched others, found what benefits she had, delayed intake for a day to spend a last night together.  Had she delayed much longer, she likely would have gotten a bit better, life isn't so bad, and I don't think I need to go inpatient.  I was the one who woke her up on the big day, got her out out bed and showered, helped pack her backpack and clothes.  I was effectively pushing the process along without realiasing what I was effectively doing was pushing her towards the unknown; the psych ward.  She thanked me for gently forcing her to go.

She also tells me she is proud of me for taking care of the mundane stuff, such as filling out all the forms needed for the insurance, getting a few thing she forgot, feeding our cats.and tomorow she has asked for me to bring many paperback books to donate, and several puzzles of varying difficulty.  Donate because her and her friends want them in there.

It is getting easier to see that she told me and asked me to help her because she trusts me.  I haven't failed, I just got assigned the details parts because she knew I could handle it.  Still stings, but not as much.  She tells the other ladies stories about me and our antics and how I helped with her decision.  I'm now apparently the husband od the year in their eyes.  I'm just holding it together right now, I will need her strength when she gets out.  

My music list punked me when driving today.  What's the first song on the playlist?  ""She's Gone"", by hall &amp; oates.  Followed immediately by the Sheryl crow song ""are you man to be my man.""  If that isn't a punking, i don't know what is.  

Here's to a good solid hour of holding my baby so close tomorrow.",04Feb2017,8
12,"This is going to be a hard one to explain. 

I fist noticed this when I was sixteen, while I was in a severe low, shortly before a suicide attempt that resulted in a months stay in a psych ward. My brother, a year and a half older than me, was bugging me. Not unusual. We have that kind of relationship where teasing each other is the same as saying I love you. But then he made a comment about my weight. I'm very self conscious, so I didn't like that. Before I could stop myself, I had swung around and slapped him across the face. Hard. Both him and my mom were too stunned to say anything, as I've never done anything violent before.  

But it felt amazing. It was like this rush of pure adrenaline that nothing could ever match. I mean, I felt bad about it later, but for at least an hour after the incident I was thrilled. I've noticed that same feeling whenever I lose my temper with my parents and yell or scream or insult them. I know it's horrible. I have anger issues that I need to learn to control. But should it feel this good?

I'm living in a group home now and in a severe low again. I'm worried I'll lose my temper with my roommates or god forbid the wonderful woman who runs this place. I like it here, I don't want to be kicked out, but what if I lose my temper again? I don't want to but a part of me wants to feel that rush that can only be brought on by causing someone else pain. 

I experimented a bit with S&amp;M with my ex-girlfriend, even though I rarely experience sexual desire, but I did find out I'm into domination. Could that have anything to do with it?",04Feb2017,2

14,"What is life but a series of events unfolding before our very eyes, thrust upon us and modeled after the choices we have made? We must be held accountable for those choices and those decisions, the poor ones as well as the good. I know life is precious and that it is a gift, fleeting by with every tick of the clock. Sometimes it seems unfair. Some suffer while others flourish. Some manage to find a semblance of peace, while others find every day to be a constant battle.


A friend of mine lost that battle a few months ago. He was truly one of the kindest, most gentle souls I have met throughout my life. He was positive, adventurous, strong (both physically and mentally). He was a true inspiration, a hero, my hero. Though he was many years younger, I looked up to him. I saw within him many of the qualities I wished I could possess. In truth, I was not only in awe of him, but also jealous of him, and to be completely honest a little smitten.


Everything that he was, the glow he radiated, his bright smile, all of his kind words, all of it faded quickly into darkness. His face changed. No longer did we see him smile. No longer did he have the confidence to do the simplest tasks. He was dying from the inside out. After physically and psychologically being affected by an elective surgery, all of his demons came to life and plagued him, breaking him down more and more each day. Despite all who loved him reaching out to catch him, all of the professional help he received, those demons swallowed him up.


Now I am left to wonder about life. It is worth living and worth fighting every single day for something better. I know that it is. Yet, what I believed about the universe has been shaken, if not shattered. I used to think that there was balance to the universe, that there are things that just work out the way they are supposed to -of course not all the time- but I thought... for someone like him... there is just no reason... There is no justice, no fairness, no hidden lesson to be unraveled from this... It just plain sucks!


I know that I should do my utmost best to be the person he saw in me. I should live my life in a way that could make him proud, proud of the person he chose to call his friend. I just don't know how...


Some of the things that I do, that I think, that I am... I think they would disappoint him.


It makes me wonder if I were to be my truest self, that I would disappoint everyone that I cared about. I just keep finding myself making the wrong choices, or, worse yet, being indecisive and hesitating to make the right ones...

16,"I know that this probably sounds stupid, but I'm being completely serious. I'm fifteen, and I used to go to therapy. For nearly seven years actually. I have two, diagnosed, anxiety disorders. My mom pulled me out a couple of years ago. 

A lot has happened since then, including my mom being investigated for emotional abuse. But, the main reason I'm posting here is because I have to go back to therapy now, at least to be evaluated. 

Part of my anxiety disorder is a horrible fear of medication. I can hardly take an Advil without having a panic attack. My mom knows this, but she continuously says thing like, ""Do you really want to go back to therapy? They're just going to put you on medication."" And it's really hard because it sort of sounds like a threat. 

Anyways, my main question for you guys is, if I do get put on medication, is that okay? My mom makes it sound like I won't be myself anymore and that kind of makes me more scared. ",04Feb2017,8
17,"My pipedream is to start an organization that is open 24/7 for people who just need somewhere to go to add a little wellness to their lives immediately, mostly for mental purposes. Imagine if, when you're feeling alone and sad or having a panic attack, there were a place nearby where you can talk to someone anytime or take a fitness class to help take care of yourself. In this facility, I'd love to have classes for all kinds of things- meditation, altruism, helping men express their emotions, lgbt, etc. also spaces to get exercise, people to talk to, and literature for dealing with mental illness.

18,"Ever since I was little, I just sometimes get the feeling that I'm going to die soon. I remember being about to turn 10 and really really believing that I would die before my 10th birthday, and I was counting down the days to my birthday and making sure to tell my parents constantly that I loved them because I was really convinced I wasn't going to live to see 10. That's my earliest memory of this happening and probably the first time I felt this way, but still every now and then I'll really feel like I'm going to die, especially at night in my sleep. Often, like tonight, I'll stay up and keep myself from falling asleep out of fear that I'll die if I fall asleep. It's currently 4:25 a.m. and I have things to do tomorrow, but I'm scared to go to sleep. I've even written hidden letters for my friends and family to find in case I do die, but I've never told anyone because I don't want it to seem like I'm writing suicide notes.

21,"Hi redditors, posting here because I feel like this doesn't qualify to be on r/depression (been reading through and everything sounds really serious in comparison to my situation...) So,

Lately I've been doing some googling on depression, including mild depression vs sadness which hasn't helped my understanding all that much. I'd really appreciate any thoughts or advice and hope this doesn't sound too naive or overdramatic. Sigh, just going to list a bunch of facts/questions:

Been feeling more down and tired than usual over the last month or so + reacting more easily lately (eg. tearing up/getting irritated over smaller things), self-harmed 4/5 times in the past month* which is the most frequently I ever have (but as far as self harm goes not very seriously and never considered suicide), feeling like I've drifted from/lost most of my close friends, been wanting to sleep more often just so I don't have to be awake but still not getting enough hours because I tend to procrastinate a lot, feeling stressed/guilty for not keeping on top of study particularly at night, I know exercise should help but I CBS so often :/
*also feel like I can't currently talk to my best friend about it because although he knows I have self harmed in the past he doesn't know it has continued and has mentioned that if I did again he'd feel like he'd failed as a friend (so not too keen on telling him before he understands it doesn't indicate his failure in any way).

On the other hand I still do enjoy music/reading and am genuinely happy with friends and at church (not having to always fake emotions while I'm actually dead on the inside like so many websites seem to say). I get the impression though that when someone is actually depressed and not just 'down', they experience these depressed/empty feelings virtually constantly and can't find pleasure in things they used to enjoy. (So can I infer from me enjoying life this much that I have nothing to worry about?)

As far as 'risk factors' for mental health issues go, I haven't been diagnosed with anything (though have had symptoms of trichotillomania). However my sister has been diagnosed with anxiety (have wondered if she has been depressed but not sure), and my aunt and grandmother have both suffered depression in the past.

I apologise if this has sounded insensitive and know that other people have it unbelievably worse. Although I kind of doubt my situation would even register on the scale of depression I really hope that this experience is not just a normal part of life and would just like some clarity :/ Thanks for reading",04Feb2017,3

33,"I began my PhD last August. Since then, I caught MRSA (Methilliciin Resistant Staph Aureus) and had numerous abcesses and styes.

I have decided to not take anymore antibiotics, because after I took Sulfa, the bug is now even resistant to that. I'm saving for more serious infections.

It is now at a point that its affecting my mental well being. My regular doctor visits, infection pain and sickness in general is taking a toll on my academic life. 

When I began my PhD, I felt powerful and capable in making an impact in science. Now I struggle to study for classes/go to the lab.

Though not as deadly as cancer, MRSA shares its trait of always striking again. This is what's making me sad. I know that even if I recover from my current bout, its going to come back in a week or a month and the cycle will start all again. 

Thankfully my current infections are limited to the skin, though if MRSA goes into the blood, I've read that weeks of hospitalization is needed. This scares me a lot.

We all grow up with the notion that, if you take your meds, you get better. I'm slowly learning, as I grow up, that everything isn't as black and white. There aren't quick answers to certain things such as MRSA.

He kept promising to repay me, just as soon as a sale when through.   He made one repayment of $500 two months ago.
