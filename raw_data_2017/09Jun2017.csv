0,"I am not a pretty girl. I never have been really, but I've always been more or less okay with it. At the very least I could cope with it and get on with my life. Lately though I just can't take it. I can't even bear to have my boyfriend see my face, let alone my body. I've been covering my face with my hands or with pillows or blankets when we talk so he doesn't have to see me.

We were supposed to go for a nice evening walk after dinner tonight, but I can't because there are people out there. I am so horrifically ugly that I feel like I'm less than human. I'm terrified of what the real people would think if they saw me. If I go out alone, it will be because no one could ever love something that looks like this. If I go out with my boyfriend, everyone will feel sorry for him and wonder why he doesn't find a real girl to date. I love going outside, but right now I'm too ashamed of my face, my body, my everything. 

I need some kind of reassurance that I AM a human being. Any advice or resources would be deeply appreciated.",09Jun2017,2

3,"The topic pretty much says it all. 
I have been diagnosed before with major depression at 15 and got diagnosed again at 20 years old but from two different psychiatrists. Now, the last psychiatrist I met with had to move after my 4th time meeting with him so he said he couldn't further evaluate me with any other mental health disorder but that it's possible that I have co-occurring disorders.  

What could be the reason behind this feeling? If anyone can give me a possibility of what other personality disorder could be the cause? Or is it just that I'm an extremely emotional person so it's normal for this to happen to me?",09Jun2017,1
4,"Hello, I would like any help or advice please. Below is my situation, I am sorry if my terminology or grammar offends anyone.

I've been with my girlfriend (GF) for around 5 years, we've had ups and downs, etc... Until about a year ago I never really analyzed some of our issues or behavior she was going through from a outside of our relationship perspective. (If that makes sense)

Its been difficult for me to notice all these indicators and patterns of her behaviors and mental state since I am in a relationship with her and am a extremely tolerant/nice person.

I'll do a quick intro of her background, then to the main issue and concern which is recently.

The GF was diagnosed when she was 10 with Trichotillomania. (now i suspect she has many undiagnosed disorders on top of this one) Why this is I don't know exactly. Both her parents have some sort of mental disorders as well. Her mom is the only parent alive currently. Father passed years after she was diagnosed.

Skip to now. Things have been going solid for a whole year now since the last time she just went wild so to say. The GF has a minor surgery for endometriosis and has been on Lupron for 3 months. The past couple weeks I've been getting some weird vibes from her. So I've put up my guard which led to me catching her in some lies. 

She has been talking to 2 other guys on her phone. One of which I know but we aren't good friends or anything.

Shes went back to working at a club one or 2 nights a week. This started about 3 weeks ago at random. When she goes she says she isn't getting drunk while there and driving home safe. Her concerned friend called me and said she was indeed drinking and seemed drunk the other night when she worked last. So over the past 3 weeks I am going to assume shes been driving drunk. In my car I let her drive.

She has gotten into arguments with her entire family pretty much over her trying to manipulate them. When they call her out she flips out. Right now her mom will not talk to her anymore.

The GF is a mess, I tried talking with her a few days ago since I noticed a guy (the one i knew) called her and I seen it. She denied it and got defensive. I try to support her and constantly try to preach but in the least pushy way. She will say yes, and agree and lie basically. Lie all the time and about everything. I can't believe anything from her. Shes being manipulative of everyone and even reaching out to others to do the same and get attention.

She is being impulsive and drinking as well. (driving home from drinking apparently too)

She won't go see help and won't take meds regularly at all. 

At this point I am trying to take everything in and be done relationship wise with her. Its very painful for me but I can't be with someone who is a liar and cheater. I don't want to leave and be alone or for her to be without someone who truly cares for her. We have been living together for 4 years. I care about her and want to help her though. I am not mad at her really, well I am mad, very mad and hurt but I know shes not a bad person. She has mental disorders and they are effecting everything she does now.

Its a catch 22, shes the one acting out and doing all these things but its because of problems outside of her control. Here I am caught up in all this now. I assume this is some phase or cycle mentally shes going through and it will calm but idk when.

TLDR:

GF was diagnosed with Trichotillomania when she was 10.

shes 26 now.

We've been dating for 5 years, we live together currently.

I have been in the dark about how she really is and her mental issues have been surfacing recently badly.

Shes highly impulsive, manipulative and emotional. Drinks, drives, does drugs, talking to other men.

I am cutting myself out of the relationship but I am pretty much the only person that understands and cares for her.

I don't want her to get hurt or hurt anyone else.

Suggestions on what I can do.",09Jun2017,1
5,"ok. so I'm trying to figure out if I need to/ should go to the hospital. usually when I do it's pretty cut and dry. I'm either being forced to against my will by professionals or I'm at a point where I so suicidal I don't think I can keep myself from attempting and am afraid my plan will not work. 

right now it's not like that. when I saw my therapist on Thursday she wanted me to to go, but we both know I know what I can't say to avoid being forced to. but it's now Saturday and although I'm really struggling I am functional still. 

symptoms that are new/ causing me to think I should go: I keep crying ( I never cry unless I'm in therapy, I especially never cry in front of other people), I'm having more urges to self harm and to be more damaging with it ( I've been able to control the more damaging part, but have self harmed more than usual), my emotions are over the place - I feel very unsteady and unstable, my anxiety is higher than normal( like multiple panic attacks a day while in anxiety meds, usually I have a couple a week). and I've been more tired than usual. my depression is higher than usual. 

the last couple days have been more stressful than usual by alot, and I usually do very well in super stressful situations then crash afterwards. so that's worrying too if right now this is me still doing well. 

I feel like I shouldn't go to the hospital because it's not like life or death. and I'm scheduled to see my psychiatrist on Monday. idk if my therapist knew that. and then I see one therapist Tuesday and one Thursday. though I don't have as good/ trusting a relationship with the Tuesday one as with the Thursday one. 

I don't want to go to the hospital because hospital and trauma and stress leaving my cat ( I have people who will watch him), and fears that my house will somehow burn down ( linked to trauma). 

I do because I want the break and lack of responsibility and having people saying that what I'm feeling is real and important etc. 

idk how much I trust that the hospital will really help though. 

any advice? should I stay or go? thoughts?

6," Hi there! I was wondering if I could get any advice/fresh perspectives from people that struggle with depression/anxiety. I've noticed that I'm not happy no matter what I do, I was diagnosed with depression and GAD almost two years ago. I've gone through a series of life changes (changed jobs, moved apartments, started working from home, tried developing a more positive attiude via self help books) but I'm realizing that I'm never happy. I don't have very much money now, and even when I was making more money, I was miserable. Can anyone tell me if it's all just about getting a handle on your depression? I'm concerned that I'll never finally feel relieved, my anxiety has doubled recently and I have a hard time going outside aside from going through a drive through. Honestly, even the drive thru is a struggle because I find myself angry over even the smallest interactions with people. Idk, feeling lost, I welcome any tips for managing this. ",09Jun2017,2
7,"Recently, over summer vacation and the late parts of the fourth quarter of my most recent school year, i've been hallucinating more and more frequently over things like my friend yelling at me while i am in bed, and hearing gunshots and loud screeching of some kind(not made by animals or human) while i am almost asleep. I also have visual hallucinations occasionally, such as a metal sign saying 'oh' that is hung on a shed, and when i look away and back at it, it was gone. This has been going on for a while now, there hasn't been a stop for some time now, and there is no sign of stopping. What has been happening since late in the school year has been my second bout of hallucinations, the first happened some time before spring, more likely in 2016. It lasted for two weeks. I feel sad for no reason a lot more these days, and that's been happening on and off since i started middle school(im leaving middle school next year). I have suicidal thoughts occasionally, though i know that'd be stupid and people would look down on me and/or my grave if i were to do so. I dwell a lot on the past, and this has ramped up a lot in the past month, especially when i have nothing to distract myself with, such as when i am in the shower. The thoughts i dwell about vary widely, such as when i was distracted when i missed my dad on a bus ride to school, or stupid mistakes i know only i remember. The only instance of remission of a thought that i hated going away and becoming something good was a memory of sixth grade of my goofing around with the song i was playing in music class with my classmates. One of the most extreme examples of this would be when i made a joke about romance that no one reacted to, though i find extremely embarrassing and stupid even a year and a half after it happened. The only fix for these things is either being with my dad, alone with him in the car, talking about things like religion, or going to the city. The father one has started to wear on me and it has been becoming less and less effective.

If any of these sound like a mental illness, please comment so i can know, and talk about it to my therapist on the 19th.

Here's some info about me that may help -
Age - 14.5 years
Gender - Male
Mother took drugs while i was in womb
Head/brain trauma possible, previous severe anger issues pre-5th grade had me hitting my head a lot. I still do this occasionally, but only to get the dwelling out of my head(works in the very short term).

Thank you so much for reading. I haven't been able to talk about these things like this to anyone, ever before.",09Jun2017,3
8,"I have a unique symptom in which some days I wake up and feel fine, but everyone around me finds it unbearable to be with me. I tend to freak out internally when it happens, because I don't know what causes it. To me I'm just going about my day and trying not to bother anybody, but I guess my face and gestures make it seem like I'm constantly looking down on others as pathetic or stupid. 

It only lasts for a few days, and things go back to normal, but people who interacted with me during those days do not forget. I have made a lot of enemies because of this. I don't know what I have and my psychiatrist appointment is in 2 weeks so I'm looking for answers from anyone who may have experienced this.
 
It's gotten so bad that I'm getting negative reactions from even my family. Whenever I try to explain it to others, it ends up making the situation worse, and they hate me even more, so I usually just try to socially isolate myself until it's over.

I've struggled with depression, anxiety, depersonalization, and panic attacks over the last 2 years. I'm currently taking Zyprexa, but I think it actually makes these moments happen more often, so I'm slowly tapering off the medication. 

TL;DR I have moments where I disconnect that cause people to really dislike me because of the way I appear to others when it happens. I'm looking for others who might tell me what's wrong with me.",09Jun2017,1

The US healthcare is such a fucking shit show. I didn't think it would be that obvious but since Trump took over its gone down the shitter (Calif). I don't know but I think something like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) but for mental health would provide a huge benefit to people -- I like to talk to others who are also suffering w/o having to pay $500/hour or go through insurance which my company will see and then terminate me.",09Jun2017,6
11,"It's just hard for me to connect with people nowadays, I feel empty and helpless often, and I know I'm a jerk. Like it's hard for me to be nice when I should be and I get so irritated with people- even small things. 

I just now lashed out on my mom for sleeping during a movie we were watching even though she said she was tired. I'm just so mean sometimes to my parents and defensive with people that I feel so bad. It's so frustrating. What if people are the victims and I'm not. Like it's me that's ruining things.

I want a therapist but for some reason my mom has never gotten around to it. The idea of it just flies past. But I know I need to see a therapist because it's been going on for years. But my parents are the type to be wary of the psychology system and they freak out at the idea of me being diagnosed with something and given medication that I'll ""have to take for the rest of my life"".

I'm so dissatisfied with myself that I've gotten depression from and it inhibited my college studies and social life and it still affects me even now. It use to be external things that triggered my depression and now it's internal. My parents are worried about me being prescribed medications but I couldn't care less. I just want a psychologist to talk to because I literally have no friends- they're all gone.

I'm just tired of it all. If I could just give how am I and how I feel a label, I would feel a little better. Because I know I'm not normal. I'm sick of bringing it up with my parents because we just end up arguing since they don't understand me. Sometimes I get so frustrated and tired I just let them give me the ridiculous solutions like ""talking to people"", ""not making it always about me"", ""not being hard on myself"", and ""not taking things seriously"".  

All I can do to let my feelings out is type them on Reddit. Because only here do people understand and relate to me. ",09Jun2017,6

17,"A good friend of mine took her life this week, it has still barely even set in, it probably won't until the funeral. She was reaching out to be loved, and had her heart broken by a POS who took advantage of her loneliness and her kindness. 

I suffer from PTSD, Social and Relational Anxiety, and Depression, and this girl saved my life by being there for me, showing me the love I needed. She had a way of lighting up the world when everything felt dark. 

I'll be honest, I loved her so much. I viewed her as so far above me, deserving better than a broken mess like me, even when she was always open to the idea of an ""us,"" planning dates that never happened due to one of us always ending up in a relationship, I still thought she deserved better than me, and obviously she did. I was a coward for my fear. 

I hate to dwell on what might have been if I had the courage, if I had been there. Maybe it wouldn't have made a difference at all, maybe it would have.

20,"Hi,

I made a post in /r/relationships but the mods suggested I ask here instead. I have already received some feedback suggesting I stay out of the situation altogether and I'm leaning toward that, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to hear any other perspectives.

I dated a woman for most of last year and fell really hard for her. In retrospect I was willfully ignorant of a lot of red flags. Looking back it's clear she is struggling hard with some trauma she experienced, and could have some personality disorder or other. Things came to a head in December when she broke up with me via text and then attempted suicide. I brought her to the hospital and later she was Baker Acted.  She pretty much hated me ever since. She refused to speak with me on the phone or in person afterward but we exchanged some texts and emails that ultimately turned a bit nasty. There was some debate about some money she felt I owed her (it was a silly demand) and when I ignored her she told me to get lost in so many words. 

Anyway I went no contact since February. I felt that any further communication was just opening the door to be hurt again and due to my own issues I knew I couldn't be around her even if she wanted me there (I am an addict in recovery and she tried to kill herself with intravenous drugs).

I heard through the grapevine she's got a new boyfriend since all this happened and she's quit her job and moving to another state with him. Mind, we broke up in December, so... they've been together for six months maximum. Her whole family lives here and she had been seeing a local therapist. She had a good job with a growing company.

I feel like there's a strong possibility she has deceived herself and/or the people around her into thinking she's operating at full capacity just like she deceived me. Someone with her issues doesn't just do a 180 in six months. I don't feel responsible for her and obviously I don't want to follow her around helping her from behind the scenes for the rest of my life, but I do care about her and I don't know if anyone else in her life presently really understands how sick she is. She is a seriously skilled manipulator and she systematically cut out everyone who was aware of her suicide attempt and her behavior at the end of last year.  

I am compelled to try to warn the boyfriend, try to talk some sense into her, find someone else to try to talk sense into her so I can stay no contact, etc etc. My motives are good; I too am moving away but in the opposite direction. I have no desire to resume a relationship with her. There is some jealousy there for sure but I'm fully convinced there is no hope of a happy or healthy relationship between us. I want for her to do well and get better but this decision seems like a giant leap in the wrong direction. What do I do here?

Tl;dr my mentally ill ex is about to do something that's probably going to blow up in her face. Do I stay out of it?",10Jun2017,1

I think nerds are so selfish because they don't care they're nerds and I get pissed off when people favor nerds even if they're fictional ones. I just feel like grabbing them and yelling ''WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? WHY DO YOU LIKE NERDS??'' Sometimes I think they're doing it on purpose to upset me and make me angry and want to beat them. 

I remember when I was a teenager I'd write up stories of nerds getting killed, one of the involved beating a nerd, stabbing out his eyeballs then pouring salt into them. Everything they do or say annoys the living hell out of me just because it's coming from a stupid nerd.

I also read about nerds going crazy and they killed the person by wrapping their legs around the persons neck and suffocating them. Nerds can't even kill people in the normal way which makes me hate them even more.",10Jun2017,0

Let's say I try relaxing reading a book. I soon hit a lull, loosing interest, my energy seems to seep out, I feel tired, moving around feels heavy, I dislike whatever the reading. Then I will hit a passage that really sparks my interest, and suddenly my mind starts churning, my energy comes back, I get inspired, ideas flow into my head, I could easily move or walk around. Yet, oddly, I also feel discomfort in my stomach, akin to a gnawing hunger even when full (I've been struggling with eating disorders that kind of messed my sense of hunger). Sometimes also anxiety, if I get too engage/manic and actually use the energy to stop reading and work on something. But then I will hit another boring passage in the book, and again my energy will slowly drain away...

The cycle just repeats over and over, a few times over maybe an hour of reading. It almost feels like a microscale bipolar where I go from manic to drained rapidly, based on how engaged or bored I am. This more or less applies to my whole day and, needless to say, is very exhausting. Neither side of the spectrum is really pleasant.

Anyone have any idea wtf is going on? Did I break my mind/body with a few years of mixed manic work, depression, anxiety and unhealthy eating/exercise?
