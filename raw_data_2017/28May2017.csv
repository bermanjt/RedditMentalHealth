1,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask this question but i'll go anyway.

Sometimes (quite often), i almost get lost within my own head and dissociate from reality, its difficult to put into words but i almost forget i exist and just exist on autopilot and then i eventually wake up. When it happens i go about my daily duties and no one else even notices that something is up with me even though its almost like i'm not physically there. In instance, i was at work (i work in a restaurant), and i was on fry duty, i look at the clock it is 10 am, my mind slips away, and i ""wake up mentally"" and it is 11:05 and it felt like a second in between yet i got all my work done and no one realized a difference in me. this has happened my whole life and i'm not sure if it happens to everyone and i'm just thinking too much or if i'm crazy.

4,"I have a serious problem . I feel like there's a person (if you want to call it that but their not visible) that's watching me all the time. I almost feel as if there controlling me. Like their in my head. Its like they've taken away my whole being and all that's left is a walking body. I feel lifeless like my soul has been taken out of me and I feel like their taking over slowly by the day. I can't express myself because if them. I even just feel awkward writing I a journal because of them so I never do and basically don't do anything else either for the same reason. I just literally feel like IM not here. I don't know what IS here but it doesn't feel like me. I don't feel free. I look in the mirror and I don't know who I am anymore. Its like I'm dead but something keeps pushing me to exist but not live. Its like their letting me exist (like eating, sleeping, walking) but theyve taken away my thoughts, my feelings, the things i want, and everything that makes me who i am. They feel like a monster that's just taking up all the room in my mind and I can't even think anymore. When I go out in public its even worse because its like I can feel them. I have lost myself and all that's left is a lifeless body with functioning body parts but I feel like the real me has been taken away. I feel like I'm just a machine now and they think I don't even deserve thoughts or feelings anymore. I just want to be able to express myself again but I am lost and Im not here right now.",28May2017,1
5,"When I was younger I had a bout of depression that accompanied self-harm. All was well and time healed. Now I have more depression but have not self-harmed for a very long time. I still mentally have the ability to ""not feel pain"" that for some comes with self harming behaviors. 

I plan on bringing it up with my doctor but since it's not negatively impacting my life as my current depression is that must take prominence in my valuable meeting time. 

I am curious though and can't find anything really about it online. Am I searching wrong? I fail to believe I am alone in this and think reading through some info online will help me spot when it's happening and I don't want it too and prevent blundering into harm. 

For some context, it takes ""prep time"" for lack of a better word and I lose my fine motor skills say in my arm or leg if that's the ""target location"" again for lack of a better word. Generally, I avoid trying to trigger it as I feared it could lead me into self-harming in order to return proper feeling to the area. I am curious though if this is a form of disassociation I have felt the ""running on auto-pilot"" that others have in relation to my overall body (again kinda scary and something I want to avoid). I have yet to really find anything about just body parts being cut-off mentally. 

Kinda just wondering if anyone has experienced something similar to this, if anyone has heard of this and if anyone can link to an external medical journal or the likes discussing this. Heck I will even take ""try googling this..."" at this point. Sick of feeling like I dont know how to use google. ",28May2017,1

8,"I was reading the thread “What’s your secret that could ruin your life” and felt the need to write up my story. I’ve been dealing with an otherwise undiagnosed mental illness for most of my life, all of my friends and family know what I deal with (Which is why I didn't post this there...)

I see, hear and occasionally feel things that are not really there. 
It all really hit me after I graduated from College, but I’ve really been experiencing this in much lower dose my entire life. As a child I would see things like shining lights or giant balls of static float by me and as a kid I felt them real. They still do feel real to me. I always tried pointing them out but no one ever looked in time, they’d always be out of view by the time they looked – if they looked at all.

After College I began to fall into depression, I began to feel dead inside as if none of my emotions mattered and that I shouldn’t even cry because it just didn’t matter and expended too much energy. I began to see things again at this time. During my childhood it was only once every year or number of months between sightings, but I began to see often. The thing I saw the most was what I called “The Eyeless”. This creature lacked a proper mouth and eyes, it had pasty white skin and never spoke. 

http://img08.deviantart.net/e3ea/i/2017/148/8/0/do_you_see_me__by_niiohontesha-dbasi38.jpg

My girlfriend (Who was subsequently my childhood best friend) heard my stories of how I saw this creature and how I would see other things and encouraged it. She told me I was special and that I should embrace my hallucinations. I hung out with two other friends who, one of them also had a mental disorder and saw things as well. All together the three of them talked with me often and we shared stories on what we saw and how it was true. This is scary to think back on, because I was totally drawn in. Eventually my stress levels increased and I began to see more violent hallucinations, these things were now trying to get me. Their bodies contorted into awful unimaginable positions and whenever I saw one it was screaming at or running towards me. 
I’ve never felt so scared. 

My girlfriend wasn’t very smart, she was lovely and incredibly creative but she had no life skills and I eventually realized that she was using me to take care of her as she meandered her way through life. I spent almost an entire year dealing with these hallucinations and with her. I stopped having meaningful conversation and began to weigh the pros and cons of being with her. On one fateful night I broke it off in an instant and without warning. I moved out without letting her argue or convince me otherwise. For me this was a “final straw” sort of thing. I did my best to work through our problems and to understand her for who she was but realized our relationship was not a healthy one and that I had to move on. 

It was during the time I lived alone that my hallucinations got worse. I withdrew from the entire world, stopped talking to my parents, and began to call in sick for work. I was hearing voices all the time, and seeing things multiple times a day. Sometimes they were shadows of humans passing by or walking just out of my peripheral, sometimes they were beasts of all sorts glowering down at me from atop the stairs. I became incredibly depressed in this time and began to miss work without calling in. I’d wake up at 3pm to missed calls because I never showed up for work and never called in, I’d slept 20 hours and hadn’t even flinched at my alarm. 

Work became strenuous, it was so hard to keep focused and happy when I wanted to die inside. I eventually confided in my boss of what I was going through and he was so incredibly sympathetic that it threw me back. I felt like I was a failure and the weirdest thing above all is that I felt like all the hallucinations were normal. I was surprised by peoples shocked expressions and reactions when I tell them what I go through and I was regularly told about how strong I was to keep going through all the adversities. For a little while I held onto the belief that these hallucinations made me special, but I grew out of that notion.

The hallucinations got worse and worse the longer I dealt with them until one such day I saw a black mist following me. It spoke in hushed words which I blocked out and I proceeded to ignore it while I worked. It continued to speak and follow me as the day wore on and when it was time to go, followed me into the elevator ride down. As I descended, it transformed into a seven foot tall man with the head of a jackal with rust brown fur and a maw that curved into a smile. It began to walk after me and I was too stubborn to acknowledge it. 

As I walked out it began to touch me, it grabbed onto my shoulders and started whispering in my ear things like “They can hear you breathe” or “That man wants to steal your money” things like that. I eventually left the mall where he harassed me the most and crept onto the bus, I was so close to breaking into tears but refused. When I sat down it sat down in the empty seat beside me, leaned forward and let out a long breath as it rubbed its snout against my left ear and cheek. I could feel its fur as if it were real and kept my eyes forward, refusing to look, refusing to respond. 
I went to the hospital that night, and stayed there admitted for three days while I slowly recovered.
After that night, and still while I lived alone I had another hallucination that was just about as creepy but in a much different way. I was about to fall asleep one night and began to speak to the voices I heard. As you can imagine I began to get responses and held a little conversation before eventually drifting off to sleep. As my body relaxed I heard one final response: “You should probably get rid of those spiders” but I ignored it as I’d convinced myself that these voices were all in my head and that I was hallucinating. The next morning I was awoken by a tickling sensation on my face and I shit you not I squished a spider that had decided to crawl on my forehead. I’ve never forgotten that night as it’s one of the realist hallucinations I’ve had.

These major hallucinations were three years ago. I’ve been dealing with them every day, though sometimes I’ll go a couple days, if I’m luck even a month without seeing anything. Those are really good times. I’m medicated on Wellbutrin &amp; Risperidone but still hallucinate every day. These days the hallucinations aren’t often as vivid, but I still do experience strikingly realistic visions. The main ones I experience are responses to tactile stimuli. If I graze my skin I see my skin split open and fall off in chunks revealing bone and veins. If I touch my ankles I envision my veins crawling out or falling out of me. I still see shadows and sometimes I see people’s faces become distorted. These hallucinations are almost always out of the corner of my eye.

I have terrible bouts of depression and have been diagnosed with such, as well as Generalized Anxiety, Disassociation (Not otherwise specified) and PTSD due to my mentally abusive and severely neglected childhood. I’m not extremely convinced on the PTSD part… and now that I think about it, it doesn’t make sense to be the source of my hallucinations since I’ve experienced them my whole life. I’m not sure what to think and I figured that if I were to post my story someone would talk to me. I might get words of inspiration or might become a step closer to figuring out what the fuck is really wrong with me. 

TLDR: Terribad hallucinations all my life and some tough encounters.

10,"Hi everyone,

I'm here asking because I'd rather not be judged in person for even making comments like this, you know how it can be.  

I had a turbulent time growing up and into my early twenties, and now feel like things are fairly okay, except when I'm bored. I've dealt with sleep issues my entire life except as of late they have started to improve. Because of this though, I'm only working 2 days a week as well as living with my parents. They are supportive enough, but lack the empathy or understanding to really help at all.  Lately I've become incredibly lethargic, and increased suicidal thoughts, like every day for the last month, progressively getting worse. When I'm engaged at work or doing other stuff I'm okay, but when my thoughts wander this is where they go. Is this natural? Or a sign of something else? Any input is welcome.",29May2017,1

12,"i cannot do this anymore. i nearly died a couple years back from an intentional overdose. i had five minutes to live when the ambulance got there and i was so angry when i was taken out of the coma. a lot of people say that pills don't work, but i had the perfect mix of pills and even the doctors told my family that they had never seen a suicide attempt using pills that bad. my parents won't talk about it much, but from what i was told was that it was so bad that the emt, the nurses and doctors could barely stay in the room and some of them were crying. i regret that, i wish i didn't put any of them in that much distress. i've always had such a big heart and that's a lot of what has led me back into this suicidal funk. i'm constantly giving with little in return. i'm twenty-three and i've been to rehab twice. i went sixty days off opiates and xanax this time around and had a lapse. i wanted to escape. i've just accepted that i don't think i'm ever going to fully give up drugs. i've had an eating disorder for the past thirteen years and i regret going into a substance/ed program since i gained at least twenty pounds and it's screwed me up big time. i can't look at myself in the mirror. i have stopped seeing my friends. i've thrown up nearly everything since i left rehab since it's been so hard to restrict. i'm honestly tired of all of this and i feel even worse since i have a good support system but it's now a rule that if i even mention suicide that i'm going in the psych ward. i've been comparing hanging, suicide by train, a gun, co poisoning with sleeping pills since i just want something that's going to work this time. i don't want to be here. i don't value my life. i'm always subconsciously trying to die whether it's crossing a road without looking or being reckless driving to the point where i could kill myself but not inflict anything on others. i was almost dead from the anorexia when i entered rehab and that's how i wanted to go since everyone would just think it's an eating disorder and that it wasn't me trying to intentionally kill myself. i'm so tired of it all.",29May2017,1

17,"I know I've needed therapy for a long time but the idea of doing the search to find a therapist was always too overwhelming. After I hit a breaking point where I would have committed suicide if it wasn't for someone else in my extended friend group doing it (I didn't know her but couldn't put anyone through having to deal with that twice all at once), I've known I needed to work with a professional to figure out how to unpack all of the various issues, trauma, insecurity, etc. I've bottled up for over a decade now.

It's hard though. People say to talk to someone, and every time I have it's been too much for the other person and makes me feel vile and broken. Plus, it doesn't really help because it just scratches the surface. I don't think it's fair nor are most people capable of handling all of somebody else's issues, especially when they're a personal friend/colleague/whatever. 

The thing is, taking that leap feels impossible. The cost is frightening when I pretty much only make ends meet as is. The fear of failure and not finding someone who is a good fit worries me because I'm scared it'll just make me spiral even deeper.

I know there's a lot of hotlines you can call but I've never really felt comfortable with a one-and-done type thing. Are there any go-to organizations where you can have the same person to occasionally reach out to to help you get on track with finding a qualified professional to work with? I'd love any pointers anyone may have. Thank you.",29May2017,2

19,"Hi,  
&amp;nbsp;

I've always been aware that of this particular issue but now it's proving to be bigger than I initially thought.   
&amp;nbsp;

I am generally a very curious person, I really like getting to know people and their experiences. But once, I get to know the other person within a period of 2-3 months, I feel like I can predict their behavior.  This causes me to feel ""bored"" with the relationship, or feel like it's a drag.  
Due to the boredom, I start avoiding the person or become somewhat hostile to him/her, no matter how hard I try not to be.

Any thoughts on the same would be appreciated.

21,"This is my first post here and I don't even know how many of you are from the Long Island NY area but I am in need of some advice. I'm mentally disabled, have been since birth, I have depression, anxiety disorder and a host of smaller issues that keep me from working. Here in New York State there is a program called Supported Housing. I pay a third of my SSI to a Mental Health agency, which rents an apartment. I have been in the program for many years. Anyway, the problem is the neighborhood I am living in (Westbury) is getting worse. In recent years there has been an upswing of MS13 gang activity. The town itself is a dead town, there is no life here which is very depressing. Grown men, particularly in the warmer months hang out on the streets &amp; get drunk. It does not feel safe here esp after dark, there's muggings &amp; gang activity. So I've been trying to move out. I am fortunate my housing agency agrees to help me move, but the problem is given their budget for rent (which is based on the HUD Far Market rate) doesn't seem to get me to the towns I would need to live in. Since I can't drive I need to live in a town with good train service. The problem is all the towns that are safe and have good train service have also become expensive. Long Island has changed alot, it has gotten very expensive here and most of the middle class environment that I grew up with is gone, replaced by extremes of wealth &amp; poverty. So most of the apts in the towns that I would live in (say Farmingdale) are way over the budget. And the units that I do find, when I contact them and tell them I am in a program they never get back to me. I have been told housing discrimination is rampant. I've actually had people tell me ""people pay good money to live away from people in programs like you"". Most landlords want a good credit score (I have none since I cant work), and a white collar type salary. I feel like I may not be able to find what I need here on LI. I see so many fancy cars and people with condescending attitudes toward me. I am on medication, I see see a psychiatrist &amp; therapist regularly but I just cant deal with living here anymore. I do not know how other states are with Mental Health (I have been told NY is one of the best ones) but I am considering relocating to New Jersey, maybe Ocean or Monmouth Counties along Route 9 since it reminds me most of LI (where bus service is more frequent, since again, I cant drive). I have no idea if similar housing exists in NJ. But I have seen rents there are much lower than LI. All I know is I cant deal with living here in this town anymore. It's becoming like a ghetto. I don't feel it's right that I'm being kept out of the very areas on LI I need to live in so I can improve my Mental Health. What should I do?",29May2017,3

But lately, violent thoughts have almost taken over my mind... I have always been emotionally unstable, and I have always had anger issues as well. Recently, I have been spending a lot of my down time fantasizing about humiliating and torturing people to death. The victims in my fantasies range from random individuals that have annoyed me to the girl that my ex-boyfriend is now seeing. If I'm not able to sleep at night, I fabricate all these violent scenarios in my head until I fall asleep...

33,"So quick genetic backstory - my family has two body types. My dad's side: tall and thin. My mom's: short and compact. I am the oldest of 10 kids (ikr), and while the tall/short gene seems to have been a toss-up, most of us seem to have inherited the thin gene.

Except for my 8yo sister. She most definitely reflects my mom's side of the family. Let me make this clear: she isn't unhealthy or even overweight. She is just chunkier compared to her older siblings. (The younger ones still have lots of baby fat so it's hard to tell yet.)

The other day my mom told me that it really bothers her when some of the kids call this sister 'fat.' I hadn't known this before and it really bothers me, first of all because it's rude, and second of all because my family has just gone thru a very traumatic ordeal as my (very manipulative) dad recently left my mother (and 10 kids) for an 18yo girl. That's triggered anxiety and depression in the oldest 4 kids.

Furthermore, I do creative writing for a hobby and as part of that have been researching eating disorders lately. I realized that my 8yo sister's situation might put her at risk for an eating disorder, especially if anxiety, depression, and her siblings' insensitivity all collide into one huge mess.

Is there anything I can do to help her or to prevent an eating disorder or other harmful behaviors from manifesting themselves? My mom didn't say which sibling was taunting her, but I'm assuming it was either the 11yo, the 7yo, or the 5yo (all boys) as they tend to be the least sensitive. (The 11yo is going thru a lot of crap right now as well concerning the divorce and has acted out by taunting his siblings quite frequently.) 

Any ideas? Nothing's manifested itself yet - she's quite a cheery little girl - but I read a coping handbook she'd filled in for school in which she confessed that she sometimes feels sad, scared, or out of control about our situation. 

If this is in the wrong thread, please move it.

Thank you!!

36,"I'm an 18 year old female and I've had various mental disorders since I was 12. I've been diagnosed with depression, GAD, social phobia, emetophobia, and chronic insomnia. My doctors don't diagnose easily because often people freak out if their disorder actually is real and has a name. For me though I just want to be tested or anything because I swear I feel every negative emotion there is. 

I've recovered from my social phobia, however I'm now drawn to believing that everyone hates me, and that I'm not wanted around. I was bullied in both primary and high school so I think that may have had an effect? A lot of it was exclusion, spreading rumours online, abandonment etc, although there were a few cases of physical bullying too. 

I love my family and they're all trying to be supportive but it's tough a lot. My dad tries to dismiss my feelings and says 'think positive' (the most annoying and unhelpful phrase xD) and is convinced he knows everything because he did psychology for a bit in uni in the 80s. My older sister is the family success. She completed school with a great score and got into law, and did a uni exchange for a year. She can drive and has had a job since she was 15. My mum is the biggest support because she knows when I just need a cuddle, except she gets really mad when I can't do chores and jobs like that and escalates any tiny problem. I want to do my chores but something holds me back and it takes me hours to mtivate myself to get up. It's not procrastination though, it's much deeper than that but I can't explain it. 

I finished school last year with a shit school and couldn't get into uni. I can't drive and I can't get a paid job because I would take too many sick days due to my mental AND physical health problems. I have also never been to a 'teenager party' I've never been invited to stay out with friends. I don't know why. I try really hard but I don't think anyone likes me. I feel so dreadfully lonely. I live in Australia with mum, dad, and my sister but the rest of my family lives in Europe and I'm not close with them but I wish I was. I want some company. Instead of working, I've got two volunteering jobs as theres less pressure to go in and I only do each of them once a week. One place is a retirement home and the 90 year olds there are honestly the best friends I've had. They appreciate me and I feel happy. 

I hallucinate, I see the grim reaper and general things like wavy walls etc. I also have an obsession with the number 23 and people (including my family) have called me an idiot and teased me about it. I can't help it, and I know it's just a number but I see it EVERYWHERE and it scares me and I don't know why.

Due to my emetophobia I was too afraid to eat and ended up being dangerously close to being anorexic. Thankfully, I overcame this and started eating, however now I keep binge eating on chocolate and cookies and whatnot and I really want to work out to manage my weight but exrcising makes me nauseous which affects my emetophobia. 

I don't feel like I have control over  ANY parts of my life and it scares me. I don't know why I'm even posting this. Can anyone relate? Any advice? I also can't go to hospital despite being suicidal because my insurance doesn't cover it and I can't go public because my case isn't 'serious' enough.",29May2017,3

I have a very frustrating set of mental issues that don't seem to have any real definition, but I also can't really find any help that won't cost me a wasted arm and a leg. I have also come to realize I have a strange situation on my hands when it comes to socializing and being by myself, and it puts me into very frustrating situations as a result.

I absolutely hate large crowds. It doesn't even have to be a large crowd, it could simply be a group of people near me, and if I don't have a direct line of sight to all of them, it stresses me out entirely. I can't be too close to random groups of people, I don't really ever want to go out by myself or to places with a lot of people, and I have no desire to spend any time with my family (even though we all live in the same house) to just about any degree. I have a few close friends that I still talk to just about every day, but I don't really have any desire to make new ones.

And that's your normal situation of someone being antisocial or someone with social anxiety. But I also seem to depend on having someone's company. Whether it just be a close friend of mine, or a small group of my friends, or even just talking with a friend of mine online, I basically need someone there. Just a couple weeks ago, a friend of mine was over to my house after a my other guys left, and we just watched TV for a few hours. We didn't even talk that much, and when we did, it was just dumb stuff that didn't matter.

But as soon as she left, I just felt... bored. And I didn't really want to do anything. I tried playing a game after, but I just couldn't bring myself to even start it, let alone play the thing. I ended up going to sleep about 30 minutes later, and that was that.

So evidently, if I don't have that sort of interaction, I just sort of shut down. Even now, I was feeling pretty good, but then a bunch of the other annoying problems showed up and I just really don't care for the rest of the day already. Unless by some chance my friends come over to play D&amp;D or something.

And that brings me to the other annoying issues. You may find these extremely trivial, but I ask you to understand the situation and why these are so frustrating.

I can never seem to settle on anything that gives me a choice if it requires any sort of time commitment longer than a few minutes, and if the other options are equally valued in my mind. To put that in the terms of the actual problem, I can't seem to pick something in a game, and be happy with it. But this is such a huge problem because of how often I play role-playing games, whether it be Dungeons &amp; Dragons or World of Warcraft. I just cant seem to ever find something that sticks, and whenever I look for an answer anywhere I can never seem to get any consistency.

I've tried hundreds of dumb online quizzes, asking close friends I've played games with, asking third-parties who are familiar with the game, even going so far as that dumb Myers-Briggs personality types and connecting it to RPG classes. But nothing works. Trying to play every thing and testing it out only lets me find out which ones I don't like, but I can't seem to find anything I always like.

And because I can't find peace with my games, I can't find peace with myself or really anything. My main hobby is playing games, and when I'm frustrated and depressed from not being able to find something that works, I just feel lost and bored. I mean... I've tried everything at one point or another, but for some reason, my brain decides I don't like it anymore, and wants me to just give up on it and leave it forever.

I don't know, I just wish I could find whatever dumb thing I'd like and be happy with it, but I just can't. Man, I really don't feel like this thing is worth posting anymore. Stupid games. I just want to have fun and get things back to normal. Stupid dependency on people. Crap.

Y'know, it doesn't help that I end up getting all hyped up about certain classes at random times. Y'know, 'cause one day I'll be thinking ""Man look at that wizard! Throwing fireballs everywhere, opening up a fissure in the groun"" or ""Dude that necromancer has an entire army of skeeltons just everywhere, that's so cool!"". ""Monks are awesome, look at what that punch did, that was crazy!"" ""Tackl, stab, teleport, slash, oh man rogues are awesome!"".  It's not even I hate appreciating what other classes do, I think some of the things they do are really cool, but when I get all excited for a class, I just give up on it like a day later. I've tried the stupid ""play the class that does everything"" shtick, but I hate playing those because that means I'm not even good at one thing. I'm relegated to being mediocre at everything.

Jeez... I just wanna play my dumb games and be happy, but I can't even pick a class and be happy with it. And I don't want to be the guy who plays every class, because I know I'll hate that, too. ""Oh crap I forgot how to play this, now I'm all mad at myself because this class is garbage and I'm gonna get rid of it now"". Stupid. Friggin' stupid nonsensey garbage. Goddamn.",29May2017,2
43,"Wasn't sure where to post this, I hope this is OK. 

I don't get attached to characters well. Heck, even my own characters I don't feel any solid connection to. But over the years I notice a trend with the characters I became very attached to and those were characters who look and act like me.

I'm kind of weird looking. I have very round, brown eyes, black, spiky hair, very pale white skin, and glasses. My face is both small and round, and I have a petite body. 

It doesn't matter if the character is live action or cartoon. It's also a bonus if they act similar to me and had some kind of abuse during their childhood and don't mind that they're nerds and the show portrays them in a leading and positive manner.

Sometimes I'll get addicted to a show for that reason, and it makes my stress levels drop a lot.",29May2017,1

46,"I really need (and want) to control my anxiety and paranoia for the sake of having a happy, healthy relationship. For some reason I always fear the worst and almost expect the worst from people even though it's a completely irrational thought. It was for this reason that my ex broke up with me and recently I've fallen for someone else who I've already known for 4 years. And despite the fact we're good friends and I *should* trust her 100%, I'm still a bit apprehensive about taking the next step.

In reality she's probably one of the most trustworthy people I know, so it's not like I have any logical reason to think she'd run off with someone else. Yet for some reason I get so paranoid about it. I know I can't expect to have a lasting relationship with anybody until it gets sorted so I wondered if anyone could give me some advice.

48,"I'm 27 male and my girlfriend is 25. We've been together for 6 years and have a 3 year old child.
Recently I've awoken gradually from being heavily gaslighted. 
I can see that I was being controlled completely with guilt, name calling, pouting, anger, victimization of herself, always blamed and never good enough. I was stupid, inconsiderate, the worlds worst father, lazy, fat, always away. 
The last 7 months I've been working out and getting in a really good shape. She will make me feel like its my responsibility to make her get fit as well, and her binge eating is my fault because she feels bad about herself.
I've always been the one to say ""I'm sorry"". I've been cut from my friends and family. (My connection is getting stronger again). I used to be very kind with self appraising myself and was very confident, until I met her. Now I think I'm not good enough for anyone and I keep disappointing friends, colleges and family.

The last 6 years I've been gradually brainwashed into her controlling behaviour. At first I thought she was crazy and I was ending it until she threatened with suicide and blaming me for it. She fits very well with the narcissistic low confidence personality. I get the blame for every single thing and I'm literally walking on eggshells. I've told her multiple times to get help,  which she refuses. Even when I got depressed with anxiety, I asked if she wanted to come to a session with me, so we could discuss how I was feeling. She refused thinking I was faking it, and she didn't want to listen to a stranger talk about how she could help . I cant talk about anything involving or criticizing her. And for me its been ""the norm"". I slowly just accepted that issues regarding our relationship was best left in my head. Its crazy to me that people don't argue everyday over small things. I found it shocking that men could just go out without being constantly checked in on. And what is still a very real struggle is not asking if I can do things. The guilt and eggshell walking is something I'm still struggling with. I keep cancelling plans so I wont make her angry or upset. ""Pick your fights"" have ended in almost total submission. 
When I was seeing a psychiatrist I was very brave and stood up for myself. Only for her to change the angle of attack and crumble me again. She is very smart and cunning when she wants it her way. 
  
Now I want to leave her, but what is so strange to me, is not being able to completely accept this situation. When she is not angry or upset, she is very pleasant and loving. It can go days without any major outbreaks, yet everyday I cry silent tears knowing and feeling that I deserve better. My main reason for not leaving tomorrow is I don't want to put my child in danger. My girlfriend has 1 year left of uni, if I walk out now So will she and my child deserves a mother who works. 

This is all really scary, new and uplifting at the same time. I finally know what is wrong and can treat it and counter it appropriately. 

But I am still very clueless on what to do. Any stories you want to share? Any advice? 
Did you leave and was it successful afterwards? 
Please share any stories, bright or sad. 

TLDR: gaslighted for 6 years, abusive girlfriend, scared to leave because of child security and economic future.",29May2017,2

The lights are on but no ones home. I know the lights aren't on. I tell my self the lights aren't on. It's a reflection from the street lamp behind me. It always is, I'm here at night mostly, no distractions means my racing mind can drag my unwilling body to this desolate place. 

I've lost count but I knock again. Deaths door taunts me as I'm anxiously made to wait. It's coming this time. Unlike the rest this one is not just all in my head.

52,"I got a aspergers diagnosis (I don't remember when, somewhere around my late teens early 20s I think), and also suffer from depression that hasn't reacted to a variety of medications and other forms of treatment, for over 20 years (the depression was first diagnosed when I was around 10yo).

Anyway, lets get to focus of this post:

Doctors haven't been able to figure it out so far. It's sorta like phobia, but there is nothing specific I fear; and it's sorta like OCD but there is no ritual, rationalization, nor pattern.

Out of the blue, I suddenly can't do something; I know how, I want to, I have everything I need to do it, but I just can't. The harder I fight the worst it gets; and it makes me feel unwell (headaches, tightness in the chest, confusion, stress etc; and a sense of aversion to anything that moves me forward in the locked out task), and it seems to spill over to other stuff if I insist too much. Sometimes it's an one-of thing, but some things I haven't been able to do in years. It happens to random things; both chores and things I enjoy; from small things like flicking a light switch, to important things like leaving my house.

When it happens, there is nothing specific going on in my head, often I'm just focused on trying to do the task; I'm not thinking about failure (most of the times), not fearing any paranormal consequence etc; just feel myself feeling worse the closer I am to doing that specific task, and a sorta instinctual reaction of avoiding doing it, I guess sorta like how your body fights back if you try to walk of a tall ledge or something (a good example is that plank VR game, where people even knowing it's just VR have a hard time doing it).


Started in my teens, happening only very occasionally, but got worse over the years, spreading over more and more things, getting harder to fight, and in more recent months it's something I frequently struggle with many times a day.

53,"Both of our moms have been friends before we were even born.  We moved away from the neighborhood and our moms always kept in touch and I would hang out with him whenever our moms got together.  As a young teenager, he acted normal, hung out with his friends and had normal conversations with me.  

I know at some point he had gotten into drugs and I'm assuming hallucinogens were in the mix.  I remember when he was around 19/20 (we're both 26/27 now) he started acting differently.  He became more secluded and stopped talking to his friends but he always appeared happy.  He never raised his voice in any situation (so his mom says) and always helped out around the house without being asked..much of a change from his hyperactive self as a young teen.  He started to exhibit weird behaviors like sitting and staring off into space with a smile on his face and then he would randomly laugh but nothing was there (He wouldn't even appear to be listening to the conversation so he wouldn't be laughing at that).  He showed strange signs of OCD like continuously moving around the shampoo bottles in the shower to find their ""right"" place.  

His mom is talking to my mom right now and she said he's ""off in his own little world now"" as he apparently still sits and stares off at nothing and laughs.  I haven't seen him in several years but still don't like knowing my friend is ""gone"" like this.

I know it's unethical to diagnose someone like this but can anyone point me in the direction (of either online, another subreddit, or in the DSM) that might show me what it is that he might have? The amateur diagnosis that pops into mind when you think of someone laughing at nothing is the presence of hallucinations...which typically leads to the idea of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder but I just don't see him exhibiting the other symptoms that go along with these disorders? Hygiene appears okay (in fact I think he's unnecessarily showered more than once in a day in the past if I remember correctly), I believe he does work (he did when he started exhibiting these symptoms) and has no issues with his job.  

I'm just struggling to figure out what it might be?  His mom seems to think it's just how he is and she doesn't seem too concerned with helping him (she wouldn't if she didn't know there was something psychologically wrong) so I'm trying to gather as much info as I can to convince her something is up.",29May2017,1

55,"Here's a little background info: I was physically abused my older brother when I was a child. He strangled me on multiple occasions to within an inch of my life. I kind of repressed the memories until I got a therapist when I was fourteen. I've discussed the abpuse with my parents and  older brother and he's since apologized and I truly think he feels bad for what he did. But I still have nightmares. 

One reoccurring nightmare I have goes like this: I'm sleeping in my bedroom in my parents basement (I don't even live with my parents anymore), when my brother walks in. He has this sort of dead, unaware look on his face, and he sits down on my bed and I wake up. He then pulls some sort of weapon out (it changes from dream to dream, sometime it's a knife or dagger, last night it was some sort of plastic children's toy) and starts stabbing me. All I can do is lay there in fear, unable to move or scream out for help. 

I always wake up terrified and sometimes crying. I feel like I can't tell my parents about these dreams because they always tell me I need to get over it and that it shouldn't bother me since he's apologized. They don't seem to understand how traumatic the experience was for me and that it destroyed my childhood, and that his anger still haunts me. ",29May2017,1

59,"(Sorry idk where else to post this.) I can't seem to feel emotions, and I don't know why. It's always been like this. On the rare occasion that something *does* trigger an emotion, it comes in a short burst. But over the past 2 years, I've really started to notice it. That and some people in my class have pointed it out.

Emotions are weird to me. They feel unnatural and leaves this... odd feeling in my gut. They make me feel vulnerable, as if something is going to attack me if I allow myself to feel emotions and catch me off guard.

I remember once in kindergarten, I think I felt the one ""embarrassment"" but I remember not liking it so I turned it off. That's another thing too, sometimes I feel like I can turn my emotions on and off, but other times I feel nothing and just pretend.

Mimicking them is really easy, but I wonder why I can't just *feel* them and have them be real instead of me just faking it all the time. It gets tiring. I pretend so much that it's honestly so hard to tell if the emotion is real or not. It's making me super self-aware of everything too. Like I'll usually mimick the emotions of other people to seem normal and it seems to work.


I think I can feel ""sad"" but it's easy to brush off. What really bugs me is when there's an event or birthday, or something going on where I'm given something, I REALLY have to try and put on the best show I can of pretending to be happy. And it really sucks because I *do* want to be happy and I hate having to fake everything. Idk. I just literally don't feel anything and idk why I'm like this. It's a bit better when I'm around family.

One thing I CAN feel is anger and boredom, of all things. But I noticed that's pretty much the only emotion, and it's easy to turn off too. I think I can feel love. I've been with my boyfriend for a year and a half now and I feel pretty certain that what I'm feeling towards him is love. I'm scared to tell him what really goes on in my brain though, for fear that he might think I'm crazy.

I end up feeling bad about it, but then it always leads to me questioning why I'm like this. Can someone be willing to give some thoughts? I've tried googling what's wrong (and yes, aspd came up) but I don't really trust webMD so... idk this group seemed helpful.",29May2017,1

62,"Hello everyone,

This is my first time using this sub, and I made a throwaway for privacy. I'm going to try to give as much context to this situation as possible, so you guys can best understand how to help my friend. Keep in mind I know that this is not something that I can handle myself, so I'm not looking for advice to treat him but rather what professional I should take him to for treatment. So with that being said, here is the story of what has been happening...

About a month ago my friend (we'll call him Todd) got in a car accident. Todd was perfectly ok, and was immediately evaluated by EMS afterwards who found no problems. It was kinda a near death experience for him, and after this he didn't seem too different but just seemed thankful that he was alright. Todd is an avid hiker, and has hiked the entirety of the Appalachian trail a few years ago. He is 21 years old, and smokes weed on a regular basis but does not do any other drugs other than the occasional acid trip. He has never had a close relationship with is family, as his mother is very overprotective and nutty, his dad is apathetic, his brother is an alcoholic, and he doesn't really talk to his older sisters. Todd is part of a close group of friends that he has had since high school including myself, but apart from that he works two jobs and goes to community college and doesn't communicate much with people.

About 12 days ago, Todd went on a hike and took a tab of acid with one of his coworkers. I met up with him later in the day when he was still tripping, and he kept rambling on and on about anything he was talking about (very normal for people to do on acid). The next few days I didn't really see him, until he needed a ride to work probably 4 days after his trip. I noticed he was still talking a lot more than usual, and every time I tried to talk he kept cutting me off. The subject of conversation was also always about something enlightening, and if it wasn't he changed it to that. I thought maybe his trip made him see life from a new perspective and he was just interested in talking about it, but the next day my friends and I realized that something more was going on.

He was messaging our group chat all night about random things. They were pretty much all one word messages with seemingly no correlation with each other. He messaged one of my friends asking him to kill him, among a bunch of other things he would never say. He was sending messages consistently from 2 am through 8 am, showing that he never slept. We all saw him that day, and tried to talk to him about it. No matter what we brought up, it would always end in him rambling about stuff that really made no sense. For example, if we said ""Hey Todd you seem like you haven't been getting sleep lately, what's going on dude?"", he would say something along the lines of ""Exactly. I've realized that everyone's name has a center, and if you just balance in that center there is a beginning and an end..."" and just keep droning on about some philosophical BS. Some of it would make sense but the way he connected thoughts to each other in a weird string was very worrying to all of us. 

This behavior has been continuing for the past 5 or 6 days with varying severity. We have urged his mom to get him help from a professional, but she thinks she can handle it because she is a nurse. So far the only help she has gotten him is from his Aunt, a chiropractor (who is also in the midst of a malpractice lawsuit because she told a man to stop taking his meds because God would heal him, and he died). We keep urging her to take him somewhere real but she has stopped responding to us, and took away all ways for him to communicate with us.

Last time I saw him in person, I sat him down and talked to him and after some explanation and convincing he agreed to see someone. So at this point my friends and I are trying to figure out what to do for him. All of his symptoms are consistent with a manic episode: He talks a lot, doesn't sleep or eat, and is always having these strange ideas and plans. We didn't think it was schizophrenia, but a few days ago he started to become more paranoid and think that everyone was against him. My question is: Where do I take someone like this? If his parents get charged for his treatment when we take him somewhere without their knowledge, is there a possibility that me and my friends could get sued for trying to help him? I just need advice for the action I need to take because I absolutely want to help him because I fear that his mother will try to handle it herself and it could end in me losing a friend.

I apologize for the length of this post and how much I jumped around, it's just very hard to try and cover all of the important information without missing anything. If you have any more questions to ask about the situation before giving me advice feel free. Like I said, I know I can't help him myself but I want to know of what type of professional can. He's my best friend and I won't give up on him. Thank all of you great people for reading.

64,"Hello, 
I wanted to share my experience with Wellbutrin over the last year or so-how it worked initially, completely crapped out, and how I resurrected it's effects.

After no success with years of experimenting with SSRI's, I was finally prescribed Wellbutrin.  I won't spend much time on how miraculous it was for me, but suffice to say it changed my life. 

Then after 3 or 4 months, everything started to wear off.  I was heartbroken, and sent down a deep depression.

Again I will spare the details of the journey, but I became absolutely set on fixing this issue.

I am incredibly thankful that I discovered 2 solutions that brought back the effectiveness of the medication.  I know that many people will take issue with the first solution, but if you are as desperate as i was, you will try anything.

LONG STORY SUPER SHORT (contact me if you want more details)

The first thing I researched was manufacturing defects.  I found that they are rare for prescription medications, but they do occur.  I reqested a change in manufacturer in my generic Wellbutrin, and the changeover was instantanious and unmistakeable.  
1a..The original manufacturer of my meds was Impax.  Once I switched to another manufacturer (who i cannot recall at the moment) the effectiveness returned

IMPAX MANUFACTURED FAULTY WELLBUTRIN FOR 5 YEARS
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmaris/2012/10/10/fda-recall-points-to-serious-problems-at-the-fda/#281b994067cb

1b.  I live in spanish harlem, and at the time, i was trying to support local businesses by buying meds from a mom and pop pharmacy.  It might be possible that they are not as well supervised as chain pharmacies and 
had given me expired medication or something like that.
1c.  the other possibility is that the common knowledge about generics is wrong. It's possible that the switch from one variant of the drug to another brought back its effectiveness. I have a backround in meds and know that most pharmacists will tell you this is not true.

The second discovery was that supplements of the amino acid Tyrosine brought back roughly 70% of the effectiveness of the original effect.  I don't know if this would work for everybody. I think it worked for me because my digestive system is pretty screwed up.  I have issues with gluten, and I am also lactose intolerant. My personal belief is that my body is not able to manufacture the dopamine that I need because of an inability to digest or absorb the necessary amino acids. At the moment I take 1000 mg every day on top of my 450 mg of Wellbutrin. I have also been experimenting with something called DopaBean, and will continue to see what increases efficacy even further.
I use this brand at the moment.
