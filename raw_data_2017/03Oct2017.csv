1,"I have been battling demons in my head for years and I'm in one of those ""feel good"" moments now so I decided to just lend some understand out to whoever needs it.

Coming to terms with whatever is going on internally is fucking difficult. Being able to admit that no matter how HARD you tried to keep everything seemingly calm, you can't anymore is defeating. You feel a sense of loss for something you don't even know what yet. Which adds to everything that is already shitty, but that's the first step (yea I know cliche). 

Then, being able to gather up the strength, motivation, courage, or care to get yourself help is a burden in its own- so I commend you for going this far.  

I think when people suggest help and you don't get it right away they figure you're just feeding into your self loathing, but they don't understand how difficult everything ALREADY IS so going through your insurance, working out costs, reading reviews on drs,counselors, therapists, social workers, ect is a trigger for so much shitty shit that most people give up and accept they have problems without getting help. 

It's fucking hard and I know and I'm sorry it has to be this way. I hope for a day that searching for the perfect dr, counselor, etc is a piece of cake. Maybe then we'd have less crime, less suicides, less mass shootings and so on. It's hard.

But once you make it through that and you get your foot in that door after you set up an appointment, that's the greatest thing you have done for yourself in a long long time. 

I am so proud of everyone I know who is going through or has gone through these steps because they are hard as shit and I don't think they are talked about enough. People assume you have a problem, you get it fixed, and it's over. But we all know it isn't that simple and it can be discouraging.

If anyone is going through these events or more and needs any help talking through it please don't hesitate to message me. 

I'm proud of us.",03Oct2017,7

5,"So like many other people I didn't really have a good childhood... My dad was an abusive druggie and used to beat my mom. My mom would then like to the anger that she had for him, and put it on me and my brother, Whether it be slapping us, grabbing us, Kicking us etc. She would also tell me I was stupid, and like to remind me that because I'm different (I have a mild case of Aspergers syndrome) I would never be as smart as the other kids, and overall just never amount to there level.
This carried on for years, and the physical abuse stopped when my step dad came along because he wouldn't have my mother hit me and my brother anymore. But I'm now 21 years old, And now constantly doubt myself, suffer with anxiety, and feel like my whole family treat me like a child because of my Aspergers, when I myself and others have told me that it's not noticeable in the slightest. My mother has stopped the physical abuse and now uses psychological abuse, She's always forever doubting me, talking to me like a child, being patronising, and all of this constantly puts me down to the point where after all these years I have so much anger inside of me... Like a lot. And whenever I'm patronising to her back, or try talking down to her, because I swoop down to her level, She doesn't even care. like I'm not even worth it. So here's what I'd like to know
Why is my mother patronising to me? why does she feel the need to underestimate me and put me down all the time and treat me like a child?
Why does she not care when I'm patronising towards her and talk down to her?
What should I do? How do I stop her from getting me so angry with the way she is towards me?
And just some other bits, I hardly ever open up to my mum, I've probaly told her I love her like 3 times, never hug her, and never show her any affection. Could this be the reason why?
Also, my brother is the favourite child, and is praised by my mother, and she treats him with respect, and never talks down to him or has any negative attitude towards my brother, It's just me.

10,"Ok so i've always been a weirdo. i was a weird kid growing up and then at 16 i got depression. i'm 19 now and ive been suicidal for about two years. currently i am in a happier place than normal on account of my girlfriend, but i still get very sad. my brain is constantly yelling at me, i cant make it stop, i want to think that this happens to other people as well but its just so terrible. i've taken lsd 5 times over the course of two years and i smoke weed every day. occasionally i hear things outside of my head. like if im laying in bed and im thinking about something i will all of a sudden hear a voice say what i was thinking out loud like right above me. it spooks me every time. it happens more often when i'm taking a shower. literally like 20 minutes ago i was thinking about a song in the shower and then it sounded like a barber shop quartet sang the line i was thinking and held the last note for like a minute. a few weeks ago a fantastic saxophone solo played for like a minute and a half, i dont dislike these things i just want to know if im crazy. also after taking lsd i see trails at all times. i think a lot of people would really dislike that but honestly i think it's really cool, they get longer and slower when im high it's very interesting. anyway, does anyone think im crazy?",04Oct2017,2
11,"Hola Reddit,

I'll summarise what I'm going through, as I really need pointers to get started on the road to recovery [26m].

Issue 1: I tend to shut myself down and deny myself pleasures, except in secret. When people are around, I cannot be myself, and I do not do what makes me comfortable, I adopt a persona that is 'socially acceptable'. I try to be as 'normal' as possible taking away most of my personality. No rude conversations, no unkind words, nothing but compassion for people. In doing so I do not dress how I would like, express myself how I would like, and generally am very concerned with the perception others have of me. How do I stop caring what people think? This ranges from simple things like not wanting to be seen as dumb and just nodding along to things, to hiding my (huge) feminine side and bisexual preferences. I just shut down.

Issue 2: I cannot commit to doing anything. I get good ideas for projects to occupy myself, or that I think would be cool or fun, but by the following day I've forgotten all about it and if I write it down or start a project board of some kind, I end up just never returning to it. It drives me mad, as I do excellent work at my job and am creative, but when it comes to my free time, I'd rather sit down and dumb myself down with video games than actually *do* anything.

Issue 3: Family Distance. My family are highly religious, and I have stopped being such in the last few years, but they do not know. They are rather controlling and have low opinions of people who are not your average straight, white person. Open discussion generally doesn't happen, and we just talk about niceties rather than anything of substance. As a result I see them once every month or so and have a very empty relationship with them. I would like to be myself, but I do not know how to get past the fear of being unacceptable by my parents.

Thanks guys! And pointers or support are appreciated :)",04Oct2017,1

16,"Hello people, I am posting in this subreddit because I don't know where else to find a solution.
Here's my problem, 3 years ago I was in college and very rarely I smoked some weed with my friends, since the effects were not that great or amazing to me. It was funny but not that special that made me consider to smoke it regularly. Well, one day I arrived home from an important doctor's apointment. This apointment was due to the fact that I could be facing a serious injury. However, the results of this apointment were amazing. I was healthy so no need to worry about nothing. So I arrived home super super happy with this fact and my roomates were smoking weed. So I thought ""Why not? Let's celebrate"". We smoked and we were enjoying it (it was a strain that was way stronger than the usual). The time started to pass and I had a private french class very soon. I wanted to skip it, but since each lesson was very expensive to my parents, I could not do this for them. So I went to the language class super high. On the way to the class I was feeling already super anxious like i've never been before. I arrived there and It was a one on one class. Well, it was a disaster, I could not think straight, I just said shit, I was slow, dumb and super anxious like I've never been before.
After this class, my world changed. Starting on the day after, whenever I just smelled weed on the streets (not smoking just the smell of anybody else smoking), a super anxious feeling (where it feels that i lose my personalty, that i depersonalize, that I feel a really low self esteem, super social anxiety, super dumb and an idiot) started to arise. Then it was getting worse. Just looking acidentaly at news or pictures of weed in the web (specially while working) triggered this super anxious and horrible feeling. I would take around an hour or two to recover of this feeling. To this day I still suffer with this. When, at work, I will have an important meeting, I am praying that when I am in the computer, no article about marijuana or weed suddenly appears in the newsfeed...Can you imagine this? This is completly irrational. How can just a picture or image trigger this response in me? I really suffer with this. I know that compared with events that other people went through it is worth nothing, but it really makes me suffer so much. Do you think I might have a mild or light form of PTSD?
I also want to say whenever I am not triggered, I am completly happy. I exercise a lot, I work, meditate, I do everything that I want. But having this constant fear that I might get triggered at any minute (by an image, by the smell of marijuana, by somebody smoking marijuana, by just the marijuana word written on a street billboard) is really pushing me down.
I tried 2 sessions of hipnoteraphy but due to financial reasons I was not able to proceed. They alleviated a bit but just temporarily since I never went to deep stages of relaxation.
Do you have any idea how can I cure this? Do you think I should try to smoke weed again to reprogram the trauma? Does this even work? DO you have any sugestion? do you know anyone who went through something similar? I really would apreciate any advice..I would mean the world to me... I feel really alone and lost.",04Oct2017,8

21,"I have no clue what is wrong with me. 

I have depression/anxiety, both diagnosed and currently being treated with medication &amp; therapy. 

I have and do lie to the people I love. 

I am selfish. 

I don't seem to care about anyone, including myself beyond serving my own needs. 

I have used people emotionally and blocked them from my life. 

I have shoplifted. 

I have been employed in the past (sabotaged that with depressive episodes &amp; dishonesty) and have not had a job or even cared in close to two years. 

I have had one relationship that was 8 years of misery. 

I cannot maintain friendships. 

I have/am abusing Ritalin. 

There are times when I am angry at everything &amp; everyone for no valid reason. 

I could honestly write pages of these facts about me. I'm at my wit's end. I see no future, no point. While I am not suicidal, I still believe it would be better if I weren't to wake up tomorrow.

22,"Long story short, I had a relationship of two years that was quite physically/mentally abusive. As a result, I developed problems such as depression, anxiety, and ptsd.

Recently, I have been having problems in my current relationship (different partner). My therapist said that violence is a learned behavior and, well, you can guess correctly who is acting as an abuser now. 

I am very ashamed of my behavior and emotions. It’s like I have a switch that just jumps and I go into defensive mode. I yell, I throw things, I hit things, I push my boyfriend... and this time I haven’t apologized. Not that I don’t want to. I just feel dead inside. I am very ashamed... for the most part because I don’t realize what I’m doing until it’s too late.

I haven’t found my therapist to be helpful in regards to this. I have realized that I don’t know how to deal with my emotions and get very desperate when things are out of my control. I get irritated very easily and just want to explode. I often think of suicide because it’s a burden to carry all this shame.

But I don’t want to die. I want our relationship to be better. He has been very understanding and patient but this has to stop RIGHT NOW. I can’t afford to lose someone so loving and caring. I want to give him the love he deserves. I want to do something but don’t know quite how to take care of this situation. At all. I’m clueless.

My boyfriend told me to take responsibility for my actions. And I don’t know exactly what that means.

How do I take responsibility for my actions?
How can I deal with my emotions in a healthy way?
Is there anything I can do to pause and let go of my fear of not having control over situations?
Resources? (I’m in the US. Texas, particularly).

How can I stop getting so defensive and feeling so offended when I’m clearly being told the truth? (Most of this anger comes from the fact that it’s all my fault. I want this to end. I want us to be happy and to have a nurturing relationship).

Please share your thoughts. No matter what it is, don’t hesitate from commenting. I really need this help.
It’s definitely not fair for him to have to pay for what I’ve lived before. Please also understand that I become irrational, my initial intention is not to hurt him but rather to... shield myself? Idk. However this mess works in my head.

Thank you so so very much in advance. &lt;3

24,"I live in a small town, so whenever there's a crime, it's reported in our community newspaper.

A few years ago, I came across a newspaper article. It involved a 17 year old being found strangled to death in his car. Like, just left there. And his car was literally in the middle of no where. He was not found until morning, so he likely died late at night or some dead hour in the morning when there was no traffic.

The coroner reported that there was thick heavy bruising on his neck. He'd been strangled ''between a set of thighs.''
A witness came up and said the 17 year old was last seen at a Denny's with three nerds. She described them as looking like they came from the local chess club and just looked really nerdy. She didn't mention them arguing or anything.

I just find it odd how all 3 of them basically ganged up on him and killed him like that, as if they were a hive mind or something. He let them in his car so it isn't like he was afraid or felt threatened by them or anything. *No motive was revealed.*

Thoughts? It still disturbs me and I just want some theories on what happened. One of my close friends knew him personally.",04Oct2017,0

26,"First of all i want to say i am not a good writer. I will add some things later on to the comment section if i remember something. It's hard to start writing this post because i don't know where to start.

I don't know what's wrong with me, but i feel like it's not normal. I  don't want to sound that edgy 13-year old kid who has self-diagnosed depression but i seriously feel my mental health is not on point. I have never been diagnosed with anything but i feel like i want to. This might sound stupid but i want some kind of explanation so i could feel i am ""part of something"". I just want some answers why i feel like this.

I overthink things too much. By overthinking, i mean things are flowing in my head 24/7, like i can't peace of mind. I don't mean the usual overthinking where i would be scared of what people think about me. Well i do that too, but it's not so often.

I used a website called webmd so i could know what is wrong with me. I'm gonna list some things i picked (symptoms)

1. Poor concentration / Easily distracted
I am very bad at concentrating at things i should. Every time i try to read for a test, i can mostly read couple sentences and then i'm back at my computer again. I am not getting good grades if i do this everytime.

2. Short-term memory is bad.

Maybe that's because my concentration is bad, but i can't remember things i just read 5 minutes ago for the test. It really has to be interesting for me to be able to concentrate.

3. I feel like dumb but i have difficulty finding words in my native language. Sometimes even my ""word order"" gets bad. 

4. I have repetitive behaviors on some weird things.

5. I have dermatophagia

This website told i could have ADHD, Autism, Depression, Bipolar... but i'm not sure.
I don't think i could have depression. I am not suicidal at all. Although i have been bullied but i don't know if i'm sad nowadays.

I have never been diagnosed with autism but i wouldn't be surprised for having a mild one after i checked the symptoms. Even as a child, i liked order with furnitures and things. I don't feel comfortable for keeping eye contact. 

Some days are worse with my ""overthinking problem"". Other day it's not happening too much, but other day i feel like i'm becoming crazy and the world is ending.

It would be nice if i could talk with someone here. I don't know how to explain all these things but i know something is wrong. I wish someone could help.

36,"So I'm pretty sure my mother has Borderline Personality Disorder. Going through the internet, DSM, and WHO categorization of BPD, I'm completely sure she is afflicted. 

Going with the WHO Borderline type unstable personality disorder, I've noticed these recurring symptoms over the years:

- marked tendency to engage in quarrelsome behavior and to have conflicts with others, especially when impulsive acts are thwarted or criticized
- liability to outbursts of anger or violence, with inability to control the resulting behavioral explosions
- difficulty in maintaining any course of action that offers no immediate reward
- disturbances in and uncertainty about self-image, aims, and internal preferences
- liability to become involved in intense and unstable relationships, often leading to emotional crisis
- excessive efforts to avoid abandonment
- recurrent threats or acts of self-harm (In my particular case, it's more threats. I don't know of any actual attempts.)
- chronic feelings of emptiness

If explaining any of these symptoms helps I can elaborate but of course won't give away identifiable information.

I don't know what to do at all. Where to look for help, how to approach her about this, or even if I should intervene at all. I'm terrified that trying to help her will just make things worse, but I really want her to get better. She says she's miserable, and I just can't let this keep on any longer. ",04Oct2017,2
37,"I'm writing here because I seem unable to process emotions on my own and I struggle to really be open with the people in my life about this, mostly because I don't understand it myself. 

My husband is a loving, attentive, caring man. Intelligent, hardworking, feminist. 

It's hard to even explain what happened. Over the last few months my husband and I have begun looking for work and been very stressed and tight on money. We also adopted a puppy who added another level of stress and prevented us from spending much time just the two of us. We also were living in a new town with few friends around us (though my family is nearby). 

Last month I was fairly depressed, feeling on the edge of a precipice of doom many times a day, but did not really talk to my husband about it. I called one of my friends instead of talking to my husband. I'm not sure why, but there was a disconnect between us. 

My husband's one obvious negative quality is that he gets angry when we argue. The arguments often take the same shape, where he is upset about something, raises his voice, I argue for a minute then usually agree with him and try to apologize, but it's too late and he just harps on it for sometimes hours, and it exhausts me and I've sometimes thought ""why do I put up with this?"" That's about the only concrete complaint I can make about him. 

I have a perpetual problem of being attracted to other people. I knew this when I married my husband (a year ago now) and he knew it also. I thought we could handle it together and it would not be a problem. However, a couple weeks ago I began to be attracted to someone else, someone who is many things my husband is not: an intellectual, well-spoken, loves board games, very social. I became very attracted to him and it became a problem in my mind. I found myself thinking rather seriously about being with and sleeping with this other person (even though I hardly knew him). 

A week ago I told my husband I wanted to leave. I can't say exactly what drove me to, I felt trapped and wanted to run away. We said we would take a break, and he flew back that day to Israel to be with his family since he has no support network here. 

After he left I was reeling with confusion and emotion. I had the strong logical feeling that I had just fucked up a great thing in my life, but was blocked from calling him and telling him I definitely wanted to work it out. Since that day, every thought I have, I doubt. Everything I think seems like a rationalization or an excuse, not based on reality. 

I saw a couple therapists, and chose one who told me I just wasn't ready to make this decision (the decision being whether to be with my husband or not), and when he said that I felt great relief. I realized I've become very out of touch with myself over the course of my marriage -- and the last 8 years since I finished high school, during which time I've never been single, going from one serious boyfriend to the next. I think I have a problem with always wanting to please men, and end up putting their wants first and forgetting about myself. I also definitely had a lack of hugs and affection when I was a child, and when the therapist asked me about memories of my parents from my childhood, I realized I literally could remember nothing about them from before high school (this was very scary). 

Today was the end of my marriage. I spoke to my husband on the phone, and he told me he understands my need to be alone for a while, to focus on myself, to find out who I really am, to become a centered and confident human being. He also said he can't live with this limbo of not knowing, and that since I need to do this time on my own, it's over between us (he has been having serious panic attacks this week and obviously feeling absolutely shitty). Finally, he gave me some advice of things he thinks I should work on, like not making impulsive decisions, sometimes choosing the harder option, and not feeling like I owe anyone anything. 

I keep wanting to beat myself up and say I'm such a bad person. I''m having a hard time talking to my friends and family - even though they're all so great - because my husband is such an objectively great husband. 

So, I just wanted to get it all out. I feel a little bit of relief but mostly great stress and anxiety and uncertainty. I was mentally blocked from making any decision and I'm not sure why. I'm still very confused and doubt everything.

39,"My husband and I's friend (25m) has bipolar and depression. We've known him for years. Lately, he seems to have a serious god-complex. 

All he ever talks about it as follows:
How much money he has (he is broke),
How good looking and charming he is,
How he is a genius,
How he is such a tough guy who can beat up anybody,
How he thinks black people and Mexcians are inferior (he talks about this in public so people can hear. It's humiliating), 
He just goes on and in about race,
How he really hates ""fuckboys"" and stupid teenagers,
How he hates dumb shallow girls, and how SJWs are ruining everything.

There, that's it, that all he'll talk about now. He can't go five minutes without bringing the conversation right back to how awesome he is and how black people aren't as smart as white people and blablabla. He talks about race in public so people can hear. He wants people to hear. He wants to piss someone off so he can get in a fight. He denies that he is racist.

The other night, a young black guy who was really fucked up on meth gave us a fright when he approached us ranting and raving. Turns out this guy meant us no harm, he was just really high. We were able to leave the situation incident-free. Our friend, however, wanted us to turn the car around so we could beat him up. WHY??!!! He keeps bringing this incident up and saying we should have beat this guy up.

I quickly calmed down after that but I dont understand why I did it? Its the first time this has happened, but it scares me. I held a knife just minutes before that (we were in the kitchen making dinner) and Im scared that I couldve hurt someone else badly or hurt myself even more.",04Oct2017,1

49,"It seems, no matter what I do, I can't stop thinking about myself. My thoughts. My ideas. I feel like I can't see anyone else, or worse, that I don't really care.  Every time I think I've found out how to genuinely appreciate someone else, it turns out to be just another illusion. I find myself endlessly pealing back layer after layer, only to find myself. yeah me!

I have a tendency to enjoy the surreal, the unreal, to day dream.  Movies, music.... basically anything that let's me shut off the outside world, taking only what I need, then putting together pieces so that I can paint my own imaginary dream world.  I can't get out. Reality seems boring.

I think I'm lonely.  I had a really good friend once. I really did enjoy our conversations. I loved it when he'd throw his ideas at me, implicitly or explicitly.  But I would still spend most of my time in my own head. I have very few friends though.  I talk too much. I interrupt people. I used to be really sensitive. Me centered. My ego and my feelings.

I feel like I'm condemned to live my life without people in it.  
Is this narcissism? ",04Oct2017,1
50,"My life has no meaning at all. It consists of hearing of other people’s lives and not actually experiencing things with people. All I want is to be happy and life keeps putting up obstacles every time that possible happiness is on the horizon. I’m done with all the bullshit. I hate waking up every morning to hear about more people dying at the hands of others and all these fucktard politicians. I don’t want to be part of this world anymore but I feel like I’m being forced to live a life I don’t want by being made to feel guilty for feeling this way and for how selfish it is. 

I feel like the only resolution for me is to kill myself and I can’t fucking do it. Not at least until my parents have passed. I couldn’t cause them the heartache. I’m only 24 but from what I’ve experienced of the world and humanity, I don’t want to be a part of it. 
I can’t really speak to anyone so sorry for this shitty post. ",04Oct2017,1
51,"Hi guys,

For the final year of uni, I am doing an animation project about mental illnesses. I want to visualize how different disorders and symptoms feel, and I want to do it so that it would be understandable for people who haven’t experienced them before. It would be wonderful, if you guys could help me out with this? I have made a survey, where you can anonymously answer a few questions I have about the topic.

You can find it here: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/GJNJHSM

Thank you so much, and have a lovely day!",04Oct2017,6
52,"So i'm almost 23 and anxiety is something I've always dealt with. Usually it's manageable, but it gets really bad in certain situations. I just recently started a new job after quitting my previous one that I worked at for almost 2 years. These past couple days leading up to my first day have been pretty bad. This has happened to me in the past, but it seems like it has gotten worse over the years with the consideration of having more responsibilities. I feel anxious, depressed, and usually feel like isolating myself from family and friends when I feel this way. I've been thinking about getting prescribed Valium or any other anti anxiety medications. I guess I want to know if anyone with the same issues have been in this position in their life before and what helped them through it?",04Oct2017,1
