0,I’m 20 years old I’m working a full time job for a very big company however We are all payed very little not enough to survive in my country. I never went to college I had a massive breakdown towards the end of my school days and missed 3 months I was happy just to get my final exams done. During my life I have had many many dreams but I never know how to go in the right direction towards them and they always become nothing. My biggest dream growing up was to be able to have a family of my own and look after them as well as having a career that I love. I always and I mean always wanted to do let’s plays on YouTube but I never did it because I felt stupid. That’s the first time I ever wrote that down what I wanted to be. I’m not looking for sympathy or attention. I just want to get advice. I’m beginning to feel hopeless. I’m worried I will never ever be able to survive in this world. ,21Nov2017,0
1,"I'll be as brief as I can.  

I've not had much of a social life for the last 10 years.  Always had social anxiety and I fell into a pattern of staying home.  Basically I haven't had what I'd consider even a ""friend"" for 7 or 8 years now.  
I started hanging out with my cousin around this time last year though.  She's about my age, we got along really well and it was just fun.  We spent like 5 months just hanging out like every day or two and it was so nice to have a friend.  Especially a female friend with absolutely no expectation of anything, I've never really been able to be comfortable with women until then and it was great.  Just hanging out with my female cousin gave me a lot of confidence towards other girls.  

I was never under any delusions though, she was a pretty toxic person and I'm sure half the reason we hung out so much was because I had money to do things and she didn't.  

This became WAAAAY too obvious one night when I had mentioned on FB earlier I might buy a case of beer that night.  
She shows up unannounced and probably under the influence of some other drug and only cares about the beer.  I never ended up buying it.  So she came past to hang out, and then within 5 minutes of finding out I had no liquor she was on the phone to get a ride somewhere else.  

After that I pretty much told her off, and losing my best friend, the only friend I've had in years was so much that I cut my throat.  I mean I was seriously depressed already and this was just too much, especially when she knew how fragile I was and how all I needed was the smallest bit of emotional support.

Obviously It wasn't deep enough and I spent some time in the psych ward after and, well I dunno.

There's a lot more about her like that, but I'll try to get to the point here.  

She reached out again finally recently and I have no idea what to do.  

The fact that I've not had a friend for so long is clearly influencing my thoughts here.  Last night she woke me up with her call at 10pmish and I was wide awake and thinking about it until 2am.  
I've got nobody else, so it seems like I obsess over this relationship because it's the only thing close to affection I've had in many years now.   

She was literally the straw that broke my back and made me take a boxcutter to myself though...  That's probably not right, I did that myself but I can't deny her influence on my thought process.    

On the other hand, now that I've experienced having a friend again the loneliness is far worse.  I may end up making sure to finish the job if it continues like this, it's hard to be alone...  

I just don't know what to do.  

She was apparently my best friend, but then when she heard I tried to kill myself she never tried to reach out when I was in the hospital.  This was 4 months ago now and this is the first thing I've heard from her.  I understand it may be uncomfortable for her to reach out now, but I feel like if she really cared there is absolutely no good reason to not reach out.  

Basically, the ""best"" and only friend I've had for years is trying to re-connect after basically destroying me.  I am inclined to go back and start that process again as painful as it is, simply because it's still better then the emptiness.  
Though, I know it will never be the same now and even if it was, I know that wasn't a great place to be even if it felt like it.  

I just need some advice I guess.  My gut wants me to get back to hanging out with my cousin but deep down I know that it will only provide intermittent happiness and the rest of the time I will be stressing and obsessing over everything.  

What do I do?

4,"A close friend's sister very recently passed away from health complications resulting from intravenous drug use. Her 9 Y/O daughter, when informed of her death, didn't cry or asked what happened. She essentially asked if she could go back outside and play. 

A few days later at the wake, my friend talked said girl into kissing her mother goodbye. The girl did not cry, didn't even flinch or bat an eye. She simply gave her mother a peck on the cheek and went home where she went on about her day playing outside and playing video games. 

This strikes me as a super strange way for anybody, especially a 9 Y/O girl, to react to the death of their mother. 

Is this a sign that the girl may have emotional problems or may be at risk for developing sociopathic tendencies in the future?   ",21Nov2017,3

I live in an european country where most therapists are specialised in these two methods. I don't suffer from depression but I am anxious, might have PTSD and I have a lot of psychosomatic symptoms. 

I am also controlling, which shows through me shutting down, becoming distant and deflecting verbal attacks/criticism when I feel threatened, which happens quite often. I feel like that's also a major issue that I have to work through if I want to build a meaningful relationship and heal the wounds of my past.

11,"As the title says, I have immense difficulty when it comes to showing affection. I have/had chronic depression and severe social anxiety, both of which I am currently undergoing treatment for (Zoloft and Wellbutrin). The Zoloft has almost eliminated my debilitating social anxiety thank god, but there are a few symptoms that linger. For example, I love my parents so much and sometimes all I want to do is give them a hug, tell them I love them and just generally feel a lot closer with them. It makes me really sad that I’m simply unable to do that. I think back on all the times I wish I could have done that and how much I want to do it now, but know that when given the opportunity I just won’t be able to do it. 
Does anybody else have these issues? If so, how did you take steps towards conquering them? I don’t want to regret not telling my family I loved them as much as I could.",21Nov2017,2
12,"I've had this thing happen for a decade now where if I'm alone (typically trying to go to sleep) there's a nearly constant chatter going. Typically it's voices I've heard over the course of the day and it's alway gibberish or snippets of sentences like someone is flipping through radio stations. It's usually worse after days where I've had a lot of social interaction.

The thing is, these voices are very definitely inside my head location wise. I don't know if these actually count as hearing voices or if it's just my brain trying to fill in the silence.

Any ideas? I know I should talk to a doctor about this, but I though getting some feedback from the peanut gallery first.

24,"I hope this is the right sub to post this....

For the past 7-ish years I have been feeling really terrible... I am currently 18 and this problem started when I was 11. When I was 11, suddenly out of nowhere I started feeling like I was in a dream? It was literally just like one second I’m normal then out of nowhere my brain starts feeling disconnected. Like my brain abruptly shifted and started to fog up. I felt like nothing was real, but it was faint at first so I didn’t say anything about it. Every passing year the feeling just gets worse and so does my mental state. I lost interest in things I loved, I lost motivation to do anything, I think I’ve developed more complexes than I can count. This past year especially has been really hard. My memory is starting to deteriorate, I’m starting to have trouble comprehending things, forming complete sentences without messing up is becoming harder to do. My intrusive thoughts have been getting bad as well. I’ve been feeling so numb to everything. I feel like nothing is actually there. Like I see the things in front of me but I can’t actually feel that they are there. It’s like the world is out of focus and I can’t focus back. Another super weird thing I experience: out of nowhere the “nothing is there” feeling or “fog” would lift up a bit and I would start feeling super good, but it would only last for a few minutes then go back down again. I would usually get these like once every several months, but I don’t get them anymore and they would be at some random time too, like I could be watching a YouTube video or something and it just happens. But just to note: the feeling of “nothing is actually in front of me” has never actually went away. It may have lifted a little bit sometimes, but for the last 7 years it has never went away ever.

Sorry for rambling for so long I just want to know if people have experienced anything similar. I have trouble putting my thoughts together so I hope it was clear... I feel so hopeless because I haven’t heard anyone have experiences like mine. Please tell me if you know what I am experiencing or if you have experienced something similar! Also, if you know, please educate me on the best way to treat this...",21Nov2017,2

26,"So I have this friend from high school, called G, we used to hang out pretty much every day. After we graduated from school we went studying abroad to different countries. We kept in touch and I would notice him getting weirder and weirder every time we skyped. I know he smoked a lot of weed, did molly and lsd frequently, and I blame drugs and a bit of his genetic predisposition (not sure if this a correct way of stating it) to the mental disorder for the condition he's in right now. Couple of years ago when both of us were back home for Christmas, we were hanging out at our common friend's place, and while standing outside smoking cigarettes he told me how he would talk to PEOPLE IN THE MIRROR, that's when I knew something was wrong. 

Then couple of days later we smoked weed together, even though I asked him not to do it he insisted and since at that time I didn't know what was gonna happen he got what he wanted by nagging for an hour. So he smokes weed, starts panicking and hallucinating, he's afraid of everyone (there were bunch of people there) except for me, nothing that comes from his mouth makes any sense, he starts chewing on leaves, long story short he's completely inadequate. 

So, I and several other friends from high school, go to G's family talk to them, we take him to doctor, who says its severe psychosis and prescribes him some meds and says no alcohol, weed or any other drug is allowed for him. Since then several years passed. And to cut the long story short, there were times when he would take the prescribed meds and wouldn't do alcohol or weed, and he would be just normal, completely capable of social interaction, and there were times (which actually takes 90% of the time) when he would drink and smoke, and probably do some drugs too, at these times he becomes something you want to avoid. He's aggressive, impolite, has the sense as if you owe him something. He would come to my friend’s place at 3 A.M., yelling from the street waking up the whole family. Over these years since the diagnosis, we (his family and friends) tried a lot. We took him to doctors, spent lots of nights making sure he wouldn't hurt himself or others, etc. Personally, I’ve talked to him, begging for him to stop drinking and smoking, but in vain.

The thing is, right now I have no love for him anymore, because he turned into this ungrateful, impudent, rude person that you just cannot communicate with. He might call me in the middle of the night and tell me: ""come pick me up and take me to McDonald's"", and this tone just pisses the shit out of me cause I’ve done his requests quite a lot of times, and I’ve asked him to stop but he wouldn’t give a shit about anyone, not even his family. To be honest I would’ve just blocked him out of my life if it wasn’t for my huge love of him which at this moment is gone. But I feel sorry for his family. His parents are a bit old, and his sisters have to take care of him, and I’ve heard him talk to his sisters in the most disgusting manner. And they have their own families, they have to work and take care of their own kids, they can’t nurse him around every day.
 
Yes, when he is sober he’s a good guy. But he never is sober. What can I do. He doesn’t want to get better obviously, he keeps drinking and doing drugs. He treats his family like shit. He’s not in the condition (yet) for the psychiatric institution to keep him. Is there anyone who has come across a similar situation. Is there any way to talk sense into him?

TL;DR: I have a friend who cannot be drinking or doing drugs due to his severe psychosis, but he never listens to anyone and keeps hurting himself (not physically) and those around him a lot. I’m afraid he’s going to turn into a bum.

27,"I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for almost a year now and was first prescribed Adderall for my adhd. I just recently started to open up about anxiety I’ve been having. It has always been a struggle for me when talking about meds or my issues because I feel so guilty or I feel like he thinks I’m faking it so that I can get some meds. Guess that’s probably good ole anxiety kicking in.

About 2 months ago I told him about my anxiety and he said I can try Lexapro. He scheduled me an appointment for October and told me to think  about if I wanted to take it. I honestly wanted to try it now to see if it would be effective but I was worried to ask so I purposely waited until this past October to say yes even though I wanted to try it right away.

Well after 3 days of trying Lexapro I was having chest pains so I scheduled a visit to him where he explained I was having a panic attack and to top the Lexapro pills. He now wants me to go for a natural route and take fish oil pills and vitamin b complex pills that can be found OTC. I said I’ll try it even though I wanted to find a different kind of medication like Lexapro. I was just again too scared to say something because I’d be worried about what he thought. 

At this point I’m unsure on what to do. I’m going to try doing fish pills and vitamin b complex but  I would just love to find something to remedy my anxiety.. ",21Nov2017,1

Basically to explain it in layman terms I am extremely extremely indecisive. I literally change my MBTI every few hours depending on my mood and circumstances (ranging from ESFP party animal to INTJ lone wolf). I can't commit to any long term goal for more than a week (I want to be a psychiatrist and cure people of disease, no way I'll die of the work stress). One minute I hate someone and think of cutting them out of my life, the next I feel like I can't live without them. My mood is very unpredictable too. I am not lying when I say I can feel suicidal and sobbing my eyes out and the next I feel like I'm so blessed to be living the life I am living right now. Sometimes I feel like I am bisexual sometimes asexual. I change my entire world view in literally minutes. Basically I am unstable and volatile as f***.

Could I possibly have borderline personality disorder? Since instability of self-image and relationship is a symptom of it.

Has anyone ever thought that their psychiatrist was prescribing inappropriately? Mine has prescribed 450mg SR and I'm supposed to take it all in the morning. But all the reason ems I read say that for the SR formulation the maximum dose is 400mg per day and should be taken as no more than 200mg in a single dose and doses should be eight hours apart. I'm not concerned about the 450mg vs 400mg as in my country we only have 150mg tablets, so 400mg isn't an option. 

Doc said to take in the morning as otherwise I won't sleep. But I'm no expert but I think I would rather take my chances on the insomnia than decreased seizure threshold. But doc's risk benefit:analysis isn't particularly strong.

41,"**Long story short, I struggle at work because I can't find meaning - I struggle at a career because I can't find meaning; I know there IS no meaning and finding one is futile, but I need a sense of purpose to be able to focus - otherwise whatever ambition I have has about as much sense of importance as every other so I just can't pick task and stick to it.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Without finding a reason I can't stick to a single goal but finding reason often changes my goal and so it's like a double edged sword - I either stop looking for a reason, pursue a single goal and lose all motivation shortly after or I find a reason, pursue a goal, feel motivated, then a new goal with a good reason enters my periphery and derails me because that new reason and goal holds more value to me...and repeat**

**It's like I either stop looking for reason, pursue a single goal but lack all enthusiasm and motivation and eventually grind to a halt - or I look for reason to become motivated and end up finding new goals which distract me from my original! Or I might find reason, pursue the goal... get so far, but see another goal with a better reason and do that instead... then change again... and find another goal... **

&amp;nbsp;

***I saw a professional about this because it was getting me down, who told me I was stuck in a cycle - but with my inability to just pick a path and stick to it it just seems I'm stuck here... and I can't pick a path without good reason... but then if I do pick a path, my flipping mind and it's endless search for fulfillment derails me again.***

&amp;nbsp;

*As some examples, now this isn't work but it's definitely related.*

 * *If I sit down and try and read a fiction book, it's like my mind tries to implode - finishing the book would mean nothing to me, from my point of view I would have accomplished nothing and would have wasted hours doing something with little or no importance... so honestly, I don't think I could get all the way through, I'd have given up and moved on to something else way before then... something which had more value to me*
 * *When I was a kid I tried to learn to skateboard, I could skate pretty well but only ever learnt to olly because asides from spending time with friends there is no value so from a hobby point of view I took to running, because I could find a purpose... running fast could get me out of trouble, skateboarding...can't find purpose... could get me into trouble... LOL?*

&amp;nbsp;

So to focus I need a meaning, a sense of purpose, and when I find it I can focus on my tasks and ambition. However without fail I always seem to end up derailed and on a different route. I realise this and try and get back on track but I have to remind myself of 'why' - which in turn makes me reevaluate my reason and either get back on track or more often, end up on a different path entirely... temporarily, until the whole process starts again.

So it puts me in a loop, and I seem to forever be stuck in that loop. I recognise that and I move forwards, but then I struggle for meaning again and the cycle continues.

I saw a professional who pointed it out to me, that I was stuck in a cycle - and I followed their advice, I made positive steps forward towards a goal I had (something which to me had meaning... you see where this is going) and well... I'm back in the circle again.

It's like my mind is a never ending state of conflict - I have goals and ambitions that shortly after get destroyed by other conflicting thoughts and ideas and I seem to therefore spend all my time jumping from idea to idea to idea but ultimately getting nowhere towards any real goal... because I don't seem to have one, I can't seem to find one!

Many people I know have ambitions, they are persuing those ambitions, they are succeeding in persuing those ambitions - they might have a few wrong turns but ultimately they are headed in one direction and they are climbing the ladder.

I seem to stay stuck in this state were my ambition is continuously switching, endlessly, and I can't keep up with my whirling mind and endless array of ideas and ambitions - which is where the need to find meaning comes into it.

I have to find meaning because otherwise I can't focus - but one single tangential conflicting thought seems to derail me totally and I lose that sense of purpose and seek a new sense of purpose which often puts me n a different track all together - until my mind derails me from that track also.

&amp;nbsp;

**So yeah... I struggle a lot because I can't focus, and I can't focus because I have no sense of purpose (no meaning), but finding a sense of purpose often derails me and puts me on another track, and I soon lose steam and recall that sense of purpose, which may give me a boost but equally I often end up re-evaluating my reason and finding flaws and a new, improved reason which then derails me... again...**",21Nov2017,5

46,"I need help understanding my sister. She is ""fake"" and my family was completely aware until it overtime became her convincing personality. The issue is she breaks her unstoppably polite &amp; satisfied character with me, and only me, when alone. She has a partner of many years and comes to me to vent while never confronting her SO. I am very lonely in this situation.

We do have good times, but they quickly turn dark. Making small talk is a struggle - my responses without fail trigger her emotions. Importantly, when I confided her in being raped, she blamed me. Once after a fight, she told me, ""I hope you get raped again."" Now, I have also become complacent and polite to protect myself. I have received a lot of help from a few therapists and a psychiatrist to get over this.

I know her troubles and know she has feelings, but no one else knows of her split personality. Is her behavior a coping mechanism for high social anxiety? Does her complete lack of empathy make her a sociopath? She refuses to see a therapist or psychiatrist.

48,"I got passed the test and the pre-interview or at least they were satisfied. Now I've got another round of interviews on Thursday (including a technical interview which I have to bring myself to study for).  I still feel like my life is pointless.  It's not that I'm not grateful.  I just don't know who I am anymore. The things that really made me happy... I just don't know. I used to love programming, computers, school, and it made me happy when I did well in these things. I didn't do it for money, or status, or anything like that. I did it because it made me happy.  It made me honestly happy. It was a purpose in life. 

I used to genuinely like cars too, not because they were the latest and greatest, but for those little things that make them unique.  I was very fond of our late 80s jetta when I was kid.  I loved the shape. I loved the speakers in the back.  I loved the radio.   

Lately, I'm having a hard time loving any of the things I used to love.  I'm just going through the motions. Life controls me, not the other way around.  I was really hopeless this morning. I had a few suicidal thoughts. I don't think I would've done anything. I slept in a bit, then I got a surprise text from my parents who said they were going to come by and drop some things off... (of course what they do when they come to my place.. that's another story).  So I managed to get up and distract myself from my hopelessness.  It's still there. You've got to do what you've got to do I guess.  I'm still in survival mode, wearing my mask so people think I'm doing great.",21Nov2017,1

59,"I’m not even sure where to start, and I’m sorry if I’m not  posting in the right place, but I’m desperate for some advice. 

I’m 27, my sister is 29, and my brother is 24. My siblings and I had a pretty bad upbringing. My father was verbally abusive, my mom was a very kind and loving person but often very negligent, my older half brother was a heroin addict, and we had almost no stability. My littler brother and I went through a lot, but we both ended up okay. We are independent and take care of ourselves. My older sister, on the other hand, has been terrible. She has suffered from bulimia and laxative abuse for over a decade, she lies about anything and everything, she does wild things for attention, she hasn’t held any job for any extended period of time, she goes from one guy to the next weekly, she cheats, and she pushes everyone away in the worst kind of ways and then gets mad that you “weren’t there when she needed you.”

Recently, she brought a friend to her house, texted everyone in her phone that she loved them and she’s sorry, and then swallowed a bottle of pills. Her boyfriend called 911 and they got to her before any long lasting or permanent damage happened to her body, but she was unconscious in a hospital bed for 12 hrs with tubes in her before she finally woke up and ultimately lashed out at everyone who was there trying to help her. She told me I’m a terrible person and I’m not her family or her sister anymore. She kicked me and my mom out of the hospital, and told us we should have let her die.

In my mind, she wasn’t actually trying to die (she texted everyone and even had a friend there as a back up plan). I think it was more of a way to get attention. Some would call it “a cry for help,” but I don’t have a clue what we could have done to help her anymore than we already have. Any help you offer her feels like an attack to her. She doesn’t want you in her life if you’re not enabling her. It feels hopeless for me. 

Here is what has come out of left field: Before she kicked us out of the hospital, she told my mom that my mom allowed things of a sexual nature to happen to her when she was a child. After the hospital, she was admitted into a local mental health facility for a week and now she is apparently being transferred to a place that handles people who were sexually abused and molested as children. Now, no one is allowed to say whether or not something happened, but I can say that my sister and I were inseparable as children, and I’ve never witnessed or heard of anything close to this happening. She has never said anything like this before, and she hasn’t described what happened or who might’ve done something. My mom wasn’t always there (she worked a lot because she was essentially supporting 4 kids in her own), but she always went to the ends of the earth to protect us, and she would have never knowingly put us in a position where someone could hurt us. My dad was verbally abusive and was nothing like a father should be, but even at his worst, he never ever ever did anything to make me feel uncomfortable. 

Judge me if you will, but I don’t believe anything happened to her. I think she’s just delusional and will carry out a lie forever before she admits she made something up. She’ll lie and lie and lie and attempt to drag everyone down with her.

What am I supposed to do? She is clearly mentally ill, but what can anyone do? I went to a therapist session with her one time years ago, and she literally lied to the therapist. She’ll tell anyone any lie she wants in order to get whatever she wants, but what does she want? Can anyone tell me anything? I’m so hurt and confused. Every time she decides to do something dramatic, it’s worse and worse and worse. What’s going to happen next?

Also, I probably should mention that everything in our family’s life is infinitely better than it was when we were kids. My dad is a nicer, more understanding person despite his flaws, and him and I have developed the most normal relationship we possibly could have given the circumstances. Him, my mom, my brother, and I are very close, and we have moved past the issues we’ve had. My sister is the only outlier. We have tried so hard to give each other the love we didn’t give or receive as children, but my sister can’t move on (not that I think she should, but the rest of us did).",21Nov2017,2

I exercise almost daily and feel great about myself on most days. But, I still struggle so much with the body dysmorphia.

I know I'm healthy and attractive, when I really think about it and am being rational. So, why won't by emotional brain catch up and stop torturing me?

62,"I am currently getting separated from my wife, married 3 years and together for 7. We have a 2 year old son. Her mother has been bipolar and on medications since she was about 35. My wife, 28, had severe postpartum depression and hasn't gotten out of her funk. It came to my attention that she cheated on me when the baby was 4 months old, and had a couple one-night-stands. She doesn't know that I know. She tells me that she is unhappy, but hasnt been clear on why she is unhappy. I feel like her heavy drinking and one-night-stands are all about her mental health problems and keeping the secret from me has been the main cause of her anxiety and depression. Am I crazy for thinking that once she knows that I know about the infidelity and that I can forgive her that there is a future for us? Obviously we are going to proceed with the divorce but I can't cut her out of my life as we will share custody for the next 16 years. I don't hate her, in fact, I feel bad for her. Am I in for a life of regret if we get back together or is this something that she can overcome with sobriety and clinical help? Please help, I have no idea what she is going through, she is the only person besides her mother that I know who has mental health problems. ",21Nov2017,3

65,"I feel like at some point giving up should be a valid choice. I'm a massive failure in life and I can't even support myself. My support is moving away, and the other struggling financially while I selfishly am a useless burden of an existence. 

The cost to simply exist is too great, and I'm tired of passing that cost onto family and government. I figure I can't get very far with this discussion with my therapist as it's her job to see that I don't give up. She has mentioned disability, but that's just shifting the burden, and also a multi year process to even get approved.

Funnily enough it's too expensive to kill myself the way I'd like too. I need to research a better way. I'll finish up the year with regular therapy and doctor visits but I'm not convinced anything will get better. 

I just wish I could tell my doctor I've tried life and am ready to go, and can leave peacefully. But it's not allowed. Maybe for the physically sick it's a choice in some places, but if it's your mind then you're fucked.
