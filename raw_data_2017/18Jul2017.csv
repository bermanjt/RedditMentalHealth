Although I may not have all the answers, I would like you to please read the following blog (Story) that is.  After reading, please look up the organizations I have provided throughout.  beckiesmentalmess@wordpress.com  I use to feel suicidal, and it was the loneliness, scariest place to be.  I don't ever wish to see anyone suffer from that mindset ever again.  I hope you check it out, and maybe... just maybe, I could help you get through this horrible time in your life.  Thank you, Beckie

1,My brother was diagnosed Saturday with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features. Does anyone have any experience with this? My family and I are at a loss as to how to best help him currently. ,18Jul2017,1,
2,"I was recently medically discharged from the military a few months ago and it hasn't gotten any better. 

I'm freaking the fuck out right now. I'm still jobless after months of searching, my bank account is getting really low, I still have two car payments, credit card payment, and cell phone bill. Not to mention feeding myself and gas in my car. Everyday is a struggle and most of the time, I just want to curl up and die. I rarely talk to people, I've closed up since I got back ""home"". I just need to vent to someone who understands. I can't talk to my parents and  my friends here don't understand. I don't feel close to anyone. I'm alone. I'm trying, but I really just want to kill myself instead. It's so dark in my head. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't care about future, I don't care my family, I just want everything to be over. I'm trapped in this world and the only thing stopping me from ending this worthless life is all the people that still know I'm alive. If no one knew I existed, I would have been finished it. I hope my plane crashes tomorrow. I hope I don't wake up. I hope my heart just quits while I'm sleeping tonight. I hope I realize this is all just a dream. Someone turn this fucking shit off. I'm in so much mental pain, the anxiety, the stress, the depression, everything is fucking with my head. I can't enjoy anything. I don't feel excited. I hate myself. I hate my life. Why won't it just end, how much more torture do I have to take before it's over. Fuck it, just kill me now, I can't take it anymore. 

I screamed in my car today after I tried some comfort food, hoping that would bring some joy to my life. I didn't, I'm on the edge, I am the edge, I'm falling off the edge, I see my body falling through the air in slow motion. I can imagine how much peace I would feel if I knew it was all over. The same peace I felt after OD-ing back in January when I thought my life over. I was happy, no more pain in my body, my head, my thoughts, and my soul. I was ready to die, I still am, shit, if I had some heavy sleep meds, I would do it again. 

I just want to sleep, sleep for eternity, sleep until my life is over, sleep until I'm forgotten by the few who love me, sleep so they don't feel pain. I just want to die without hurting anyone else. I hope I die in an accident heading to school or something random bullet, just something. I'm trapped in my own mind and I can't get out, I'm going crazy. I feel it more and more each day I'm here. There's no way out of this hell. 


Sorry about the poor grammar, I just let my mind pour out on the page. I do feel a tiny bit better now ",18Jul2017,14,

But, he is not the nicest to me and I doubt anything would ever happen between us. It is so hard for me to forget about him. I have been with a couple other boys recently but all I can do is think about him and it is making me depressed. What if I always have this ""what-if"" feeling. I am in my early 20s so I know I have awhile to meet someone but this is distracting me way too much. Anyone have any advice?

7,"So I've been working out and dieting for months now and it's really paid off (sort of); I've gone down from a x-large to a small/medium in clothes, dropped from 216 to 153 lbs, and I've noticed a significant increase in endurance and physical strength. All that being said, however, I still see myself as the ""fat"" kid and it sucks....I was really hoping that once I got down to the weight I wanted to be at I would feel different mentally (i.e. More self-confidence and not feeling like I need to change myself), but I simply don't. I still look in the mirror and feel disgust with what's looking back at me and it really just kills my drive to keep working out and makes me feel like it was all for naught.

10,"My girlfriend and I have been together since summer 2015. She has depression that was brought on by a chronic pain condition. I knew this when we started dating. Once we got to the level of ""very serious,"" I learned a lot more about depression firsthand. When we were physically together, we were almost always fine, with very little issues. A match made in heaven, basically. When we weren't physically together, things weren't always great. She was much more likely to have an ""epidsode"" at night when she was heavily depressed and she'd say things she didn't mean. However the next day, she'd always be thinking more clearly, apologize, and we'd work to getting to a better place together.

Three weeks ago, I started the summer semester of college, and she'll be joining me at the same school in the fall. We haven't really seen each other. She came up to visit for one day, and I drove home for a day. So basically 2 days out of the last 21, and things haven't been going well for her regarding her mental health. For the last approximately 4 days, every day has been a cycle. During the day, she'd feel incredibly depressed (tied to missing me?) and guilty for the things she had said the night before. At night, something would flip and she'd become very frustrated and lash out. I finally figured out the root problem tonight. She's been feeling like she hates herself. She lashes out because she feels like she needs to drive me away from her, because she doesn't feel like she's worth me ""dealing with her."" She said this herself, too, so it's legitimate. I've never experienced mental illness for myself, but I think that society's stigma over it is complete BS, and I 100% reject the stigma. But since I've never had mental illness myself, I don't know how best to help me girlfriend through her circumstance, which is why I'm posting here. I'll also be cross posting this in other relevant subreddits to get as much good advice as possible. I'm 100% committed to my girlfriend, and she's a great girl. I just want to help her.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this and respond with your best advice.

TL;DR: please read the post, it's a complicated situation and context is very important

12,"Long story short, I've been getting worse and worse with certain issues I've been having and it's getting to the point where I've been considering going to the ER for said issues. I've been having trouble finding a psychiatrist in my area that will take my insurance, and if the ones that I've called, I haven't heard back from any of them. It's gotten to the point where if things don't get better, I'm going to have to go somewhere either for partial hospitalization or an inpatient program. I've been to a psychiatric institute twice before, and was treated terribly. The staff were so rude and uncaring, and all they did was force meds down our throats. There wasn't any one on one counseling or anything of the sort to help people work through their problems, all we did day after day was sit in a room together with nothing but a deck of cards and a wall to stare at. No freedom, no contact with the outside world whatsoever.. we weren't even allowed to have books. All in all, both stays at places like that ultimately hurt me more than helped me. I was wondering if anyone else had similar experiences, or if anyone had advice on finding a good hospital where you will actually be cared for. I've been looking up other hospitals in my area, and of course all of the websites say things like ""caring, compassionate staff"" etc.. but how do you really know? The last thing I need right now is to be trapped somewhere away from my support system, in a cold unfriendly place with staff there who are clearly just there for a paycheck and don't give a damn about you.",18Jul2017,2,

29,"I want to make this as short as possible, so I'll give my relevant history in dot points. Firstly, I'm female, I've heard autism or similar conditions are different in each sex.

As a kid I was:

- Shy (extremely quiet)

- Bright (always got top grades)

- Extremely anxious

- Had traits of OCD (which I still have)

- Had depression since I was 13.

- Developed misophonia (extreme aggravation and uncontrollable flight/fight response to noises, mainly chewing) This is still a MASSIVE problem in my life.


I am still quiet and soft-spoken when I do speak. I have to consciously ""shout"" for people to hear me.

I have always been intelligent when it comes to academics, very good in Science, Maths, IT especially. In these areas I am good at problem solving too. But I think I don't have enough common sense when it comes to normal living.

Unfortunately I work fast food at the moment, which I hate. I have been there 6 months but I still make really stupid mistakes and forget things I've been shown how to do before. I legitimately try to do well in my job but somehow I always fuck up some simple thing that I've done 1000 times before. I just feel like a complete fool and I just know my coworkers think I'm an idiot.

I am really bad at talking with customers because I have terrible social skills. No matter how hard I try, when I talk to people I often find that I ""don't know how to respond"" so I can only fill the silence by laughing or saying some pointless word like ""wow"","" geez"" or ""yeah"". This happens in normal conversation.

When it gets busy I feel overwhelmed almost immediately. Like there are too many things to do at once. They put me in the drive-thru window taking people's orders and money, and I got so overwhelmed I nearly began to panic and started making stupid input errors in the computer. It got to the point where I had to escape the situation, ran to the break room and cried my eyes out for 15 minutes.  I could NOT handle taking orders on the headset while *simultaneously* taking the money from the person at my window. I can't understand how everybody else does it. It was simply too hard for me and I feel like a moron for it. The boss said I don't have to do drive through anymore.

Also my boss is very short-tempered and has yelled at me many times. I just can't handle being yelled at. It's too much. I want to escape every time.

There is so much more I could write but this is too long already. My entire life I have felt out of place. I am weird. And I fail at a fast food job. I hate myself.",18Jul2017,1,
30,"I'm kinda worried and don't know whether this is something I should approach a psychologist about.

I occasionally talk to myself, its just like I start to voice my own monologue.  I don't really realize I'm talking to myself unless I catch myself out in public or continue on too long.  It's mostly when I'm by myself anyway.

Weird part is though, some of the stuff I catch myself saying lately, its not really in the front of my mind.  Its weird tangents that I don't remember how i started thinking about or don't even realize were on my mind.

Last afternoon I caught myself saying numbers, like I had just solved an equation, but I don't know why.  That is to say, I don't know what the numbers were for.

I get this pit in my stomach, almost feeling like intense guilt over something but logically I know I did nothing wrong. Even if something wrong happens and it's not my fault I feel bad sometimes. If I do make multiple mistakes, it almost piles up and up in my mind until I start bawling my eyes out.

Snow/ice:
My most recently acquired phobia, I remember feeling a bit uncomfortable walking around in snow in 2009, and it's gotten much worse since.

I keep a 2 week supply of food during winter in case there's a freezing period so I don't have to go outside, even though there's 3 supermarkets within 500m of me (they might as well be in Siberia if there's 2cm of snow on the streets).

Heights:
I can't walk down a stairway without holding the handrail, some stairs in stores or other places I can't go on at all because they're too scary, and if I stand on a chair for longer than a few minutes I start seeing black spots and get dizzy.

Water:
I never learned to swim, despite biweekly swimming class all throughout elementary school.

It's hard because I know I'm never going to get anywhere. I cannot function like other people. I cannot think properly like other people. Sick of my therapist getting mad at me ""you're smarter than this"" when I cannot get out what's on my mind, and I cannot have things come to me. 

Am I lazy? Attacks on myself like this are what dig me deeper. I don't feel like anyone's truly supportive but want to label based on expectations. I cannot control what goes on in my mind but in addition I cannot explain myself properly. Whatever's going on in my head prevents me from doing a lot. And I feel personal attacks over that. That isn't a way to help as it draws me deeper into a hole. People do not get that their reactions and responses to me affect me greater than they can imagine.

People do not take mental illness seriously as is, but I'm different. As the people around me get frustrated with me and I cannot take matters into my own hands, I question my existence in this world. I am not understood, I am alone with a mental illness that I cannot control. 

Nobody knows what's wrong with me, I have no diagnosis (and I cannot get one). I am seeing psychiatrist and he has nothing. I have gotten one diagnosis (schizophrenia) which they're now saying is a misdiagnosis.

49,"I am in the US- the mental health care wasteland....

Over the past 5-10 years I have been diagnosed with a few different things including: borderline personality disorder, major depression, and generalized anxiety disorder.  My symptoms have always been about the same but different doctors seem to zero in on different diagnoses somehow.  My issues cause me to change jobs frequently so my work history looks a little bit shotty.  7 years at one company, 2 years with one, 3 months with one, 9 months with one, 4 months with one, and I have been with my current employer for 5 months and I have reached the point where I need to quit.

I need to quit because they do not care about my health care needs, they want all of my detailed health records to look at a reasonable accommodation request to give me extra time off.  They don't have any other more flexible shift options either.  I really do not want to send all of my health records over to them, it's none of their business.  Sadly my doctor wants me in therapy twice a week plus meeting with him once per month.

This job wasn't good for my anxiety anyway because of long hours in a stressful environment.  So I'm going to look for a job that is on a second shift or an late first shift so I can schedule my extra appointments around work.  I'm kind of bummed because this work history makes me look like a bad employee but I really am not, I work hard and I've never been fired.  I have quit a couple of times without notice when things got to be too much for me.  And I never went more than a couple of weeks without working.

I really wish there were some resources available so I could focus on my health and get in a good place before I have to get back to work.  But I am quite broke so I can't afford to take off for long.  I thought about trying to get on disability for a bit and then when I am in a better position going back to work full time but sadly not much of my mental health struggle has been documented so I don't think it would work.  I have always had a hard time staying on top of my mental health needs because I had to juggle it in with work and school and my family has been fairly hands off along the way.

I'm a 24 year old male who has never had a kiss or had sex.

I've gone on dates but never had a girlfriend. I might be bisexual but even then, never had an interest in becoming romantic with a guy.

I have zero close friends or family members. I feel like if I tell anyone anything about me, or act like myself, they think I'm weird. I test it every so often, people always react negatively. 

So I read into fear of intimacy. And the part that bugs me is it says people who were raped or abused get it. I was neither, at least that I can remember. And I am one of the few people I know who remembers their childhood very well. Nothing like that happened.

But now I got this anxiety that I have some sort of blocked memory. Or it happened to me before I could make solid memories. 
I don't know. I just want to know if anyone with fear of intimacy also didn't have anything bad happen to them? And what I can do to fix it. Ironically enough, I don't want a therapist knowing my business either. They cost money and I'm poor. And I live in an area where one has to drive forever to get to one. Plus I like solving my own problems, if I could find out how. Isn't therapy like rewriting the way you think about stuff? Can't I figure that out on my own with the right materials or sources? 

I do long for the romantic ideal I read about in books. To just be myself. To have love and sex with a romantic partner. To have close friends who like me. But it seems like whenever I'm myself, even in short doses, and testing the waters, people think I'm weird and distance me.

But if I fake this normal, boring persona, all of a sudden everyone likes me and I have social skills. But they don't know the real me. At all. I'm a huge nerd. I can babble on about science and history and fiction and philosophy. I like to argue things I don't believe for fun.
