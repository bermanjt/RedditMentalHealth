0,"The girl I like has depression and has tried to commit suicide before(18/m &amp; 18/f). She doesn't think I can 'handle' her moods swings and how she acts but I want to show her I'm willing to try.    Whenever she's feelings down I always go out to meet her if she wants me to and above else we have a healthy relationship (in terms of we go out a lot and talk about everything but we're not going out). She knows I like her and I think she likes me but feels she will be a burden on me if I get more involved with her. During our talks about her mental health and situation, I'm always adamant that I want to be with her and that I will try my best to cope and handle anything that comes my way and build with her. I've said previously that I've known about her situation and it didn't scare me off, if I wasn't willing to get involved with her I wouldn't still be here, trying to get her. I just don't know how else to convince her it's worth a try but I also would like some more information on depression and how to deal with suicidal tendencies so I'm more informed on the issue and will know how to react to unexpected situations. Thanks in advance!    
    **TL:DR;** I want to show this girl that I'm willing to work with her and help her with any mental health issues she has but she doesn't think I can handle it, want to show her I can. Also, would like more information on depression and suicidal tendencies

1,"7 months ago i was hospitalized, the entire event of being hospitalized was extremely stressful for me. 
i wasnt the one to choose to say anything, and when i decided to trust that maybe getting help would work i was immediately put into a situation where all my control was taken away from me, someone else decided what i could do, where i could be, and when i could do it, and i left that situation feeling worse than when i entered it. 
after that i refused to really say anything to anyone because i was afraid of being put into a situation like that again, and whenever i was near being put into that situation again i'd feel that same dreadful panic.
the problem is, shortly after i was hospitalized i started to develop psychotic symptoms, i heard voices, saw shadows, thought people could read my mind and were going to kill me, and my memory and my ability to think became terrible. that lasted for 4 months, and lifted sometime in april, i still hear voices and see things from time to time, and my my memory and thought is a bit better but no where near as good as before.  
this stuff didnt really bother me for a few months until i had to go back to the place where everything originally happened, and then it all started to hit me, i started to remember things that happened while i was delusional, i started feeling that same anxiety i felt when i went to the hospital, and then shortly after i'd forget again, and my ability to think would go down for a while, and then it'll hit me again later, and so on. 
I hadnt self-harmed in a while, the times i did it before was when i was convinced it would stop people from reading my mind, but remembering everything now gets me so angry i feel the need to resort to it again. 
ive been thinking that maybe i should talk to my therapist about what happened over the past 7 months, but i still dont feel like i can trust her, and i dont want to have to tell her about it because i dont want to think about it, i dont want to feel that anxiety and anger again. i'd rather continue trying to ignore it.

i dont know what to do, how am i supposed to get through this if i cant trust in the people who are supposed to help me through it?",14Jun2017,2

Also, note I'm from the USA, specifically from NJ. 

I'm crazy anxious for a meeting I have tomorrow at nearby therapeutic school. It's been a long battle with the child study team to get all the right things in order for them to even consider sending me for a meeting at this school (and my parents had to argue a lot) but it seems so much more real now. I'm fresh out of intensive outpatient now, and on home instruction, but the whole story goes a little like this: 

Me, never before hospitalized, after school refusal and lots of struggles mentally, was sent by my therapist to a partial care program. About two weeks into that, I was sent to the ER and then an inpatient hospital. After my discharge from there, I spent less than a week in partial care before getting carted back to an inpatient hospital, though this time a different one. I then was sent BACK to partial care upon discharge, and I went through the whole process of partial and intensive outpatient programs. In addition to going through that cycle since Feb., I've had a lot of behaviors related to EDs (binging, purging, starving myself, etc.) though a formal diagnoses has never bern made so I feel uncomfortable diagnosing myself with anything. I also have had issues with self harm (I was on suicide watch in the ER, and a higher level of self-harm/suicide watch in inpatient) and school refusal.  I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and at one point was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, though I believe that to be a misdiagnosis and so do all the other professionals I've come in contact with. 

To make a long story short: I'm not doing so hot and I'm nervous due to Child Study Team's reluctance to set up a meeting, I'll be forced back into a non therapeutic environment in the fall. ",14Jun2017,3
10,"I can't vibe out anymore. Music doesn't give me the nice tingles it used to, video games don't give me the fun and immersion they used to, and I am generally very emotionless. 

I recently went through some really bad heartbreak, and smoked weed to cope. It worked well, stopped some bad episodes, and gave me some happiness in a really dark time. I also did acid once. 

Ever since I stopped feeling emotional pain, and regained some confidence, I also found that I can't feel anything. And weed also makes me very paranoid.

13,"So I'm a 20 year old female from the United States to give you a brief background. Anyway...

I was just lying in bed because I had a sudden mood drop and I started getting really sad (about nothing in particular). My thoughts started overlapping (this is a usual thing), but then this creepy demonic voice started interrupting my thoughts and yelling at me to kill myself. I started telling myself ""it's all in my head, this isn't real,"" and then the voice started laughing at me and told me to drink the Windex on my shelf and jump out of my window. I started arguing with this voice in my head and then a more sympathetic voice from an unrecognizable woman started going ""shhhhhh it's okay. shhhhhhh it's okay.""

The thing is, this all happened in my head. I know this because I've only heard one voice out loud before that I'm positive wasn't actually there (it was a man's voice that said ""Are... You... Ready...""). Is this considered hearing voices? If not, should I still tell someone?

I've been convinced there's been a demon living in my head for almost a year now. But the thing is, I got better and ignored it for a couple months. But now I'm having this voice in my head yelling at me and it sounds like an evil demon. Some times I get these crazy mood/personality changes and I get really aggressive and want to hurt people or myself. I'm otherwise non-violent at all. It's really weird. It's like something else takes over. It's very scary and I want it to go away.

I cried for a hour just thinking about how miserable living is, trying to latch onto any kind of good parts of it, but of course my brain just twisted them into bad parts.

I imagined me saving the school by making sacrifice, but theb ny brain twisted it to people calling the shooter the hero for killing me and they burn my corpse while my parents cheer and applause.

My god i never cried so hard in my life, i am filled with hatred so much.. Why?

I fell like i am about to die, but if that was true it probably wouldn't matter i am not excited to die neither live it's really confusing, i tried again to latch into something positive then i remember that i should not be surprised.

Because everybody around me are nothing than robots they dont like me they are to busy being inhuman, insensitive, sadistic...

It's a shame that i am being stalked by some of these robots sent by my school district or perhaps the government, why? I ask why whould they spend time stalking me? 

I am just a excuse for a male ugly teenager...

However there is still hope god loves me (or maybe not cause i don't belive in him) i will live on to help other selfish robots just so that i have a purpose in life.

I would like to have therapy but i never had the opportunity even if i had i sure would not trust the psychologist no way would i be sent to a madman clinic again just because i am ""broken"" or a misfit.

I got sent to a clinic because i trusted my school districts psychologist i told them that i sometimes heard weird sounds or voices, fucking robot that idiot!

But i will show these idiots how to lobe another fellow ""human"" one day i will be a psychologist and sending someone to a clinic would be last resort, but mostly i would love to make other people happier, i know it's super complicated to treat someone but i would try my best.

But enough of that, i feel like i don't deserve to be happy nobody at school even likes to be around me neither do i, but it can hurt no matter how hard i tried to ignore it, loneliness hurts and this past month i did not have anykind of social interaction..

It makes sense i am to weird and why should i trust them anyway? I could go on and ramble on how weird i am for example i don't stop noticing that i suddently just start smilling and widening my eyes like a creep..

How i avoid social interactions how hyperactive i get if i have anykind of new ""friendly"" robot seems to be enjoying talking to me i should stop i record someone saying to me that i can't focus on my weaknesses.

But anyway since i calmed down a bit i hope i get lucky the next days.

17,"My therapists says some of my problems with relationships likely come from abuse I suffered as a very young child, which I can't remember. My therapist before my current one also said this. 

I understand why they think this--my relationship problems can't really be explained away as easily otherwise, as I have some symptoms of PTSD in response to sexual advances, and am incapable of orgasming (never had one in my life) and feel pain when aroused too much, and some other stuff. However, maybe I was just born this way or some other trauma or repressive upbringing caused this.

 **I feel it was irresponsible for them to suggest I have repressed memories of sexual abuse. Especially since, by suggesting it, I keep thinking about it, and now I may form false memories, or, if I do remember abuse, I will suspect it is a false memory.**

My current therapist says whatever happened probably happened before I was old enough to form memories. I dont know. I know I might give off the vibe of an abuse victim. But I was also targeted by a teacher in high school (he never hurt me, but was clearly looking for an opportunity--many students even recognized at the time his behavior towards me), and am bisexual and ace with somewhat homophobic parents, and my father was an emotionally abusive alcoholic and narcissist. Those situations alone could also be the reason for why I am as I am. 

How much should I consider my therapist might be right about me having been sexually abused as a small child? I dont want to form false memories, and I can't stop thinking about it. Was it irresponsible of them to suggest this? Or are they right?",14Jun2017,19

In the run-up to the Bundestag election the confrontation between supporters and opponents of the German chancellor has been exacerbated. Both sides dish tons of dirt not only on the participating politicians, but also on the article writers. My colleague got it in the neck too. It happened because his [opinion was taken home](https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertonardelli/hyperpartisan-sites-and-facebook-pages-are-publishing-false?utm_term=.hcwJX80Lk#.dvkw3mk6J) by such Mrs. Merkel's media adversaries as the Daily Mail and Breitbart
  
For my part I wish to reaffirm that Dr. Maaz is a genuinely recognized authority in psychiatry and psychoanalysis. I can't tell if he focused specifically on Mrs. Merkel's case, for no significant professional would reveal such confidential data without patient's wish. Therefore it is well-known that he helped me during my work over the article about alcohol addiction among female politicians published in particular by the Buzzfeed, and consulted with SOBA Recovery Center (Malibu, CA, USA) experts on some extremely influential lady from the German government and her problems with alcohol. That is why I feel obligated to intercede for my colleague.
  
Mrs. Angela Merkel is a public figure. Thereupon virtually any mental health professional is able to compile a list of her personality disorders based on an analysis of her behavior, actions, and decisions. The main difficulty of such analysis is that nosological entities acquired due to her professional activities intercross, overlap and mix with previously obtained pathologies. Besides, some specific signs might be artificially suppressed by means of dialectical behavioral or cognitive analytic therapy in combination with drug treatment (courses of neuroleptic and antidepressant medication). This goes to prove that the German chancellor's personality disturbances emerged a long time ago. She faces it with courage resorting to such foreign psychiatric experts as SOBA Recover Center ones.
  
I assume that it all started with borderline personality disorder (BDP). It is not a disease in abstracto, but a pattern of abnormal behavior occurring in a young person with slight symptoms and trivial deviations. But inconsistency and frequent abrupt turnabouts both in the political decision making and interpersonal relationships of Mrs. Merkel suggest that she has it. Surely a good politician should show flexibility and skill of meeting the situation. There is a line where a flexible politician externally turns into a villainous traitor stepping across it, however.
  
Mrs. Merkel has been generally accepted as a personification of tough-mindedness. During her entire political career she has been a clever flip-flopper, equally stigmatizing both her fellow party members got caught on the same faults she had committed and her patrons who had got into a predicament. At first sight the acting chancellor's role in the relationship with Lothar de Maiziére who brought her into the CDU of East Germany and with Helmut Kohl who is considered to be her teacher and 'political father' and his family resembles a story of a rigorous place-hunter stepping on her patrons to get ahead. Yet, Mrs. Merkel's rushing into extremities from tender affection to sudden total rejection refers to afflictive but implacable BDP pathway.
  
http://s1.bild.me/bilder/110417/42005302merk.jpg
  
In addition, partiality to the high and mighty, idealization of them and following disappointment accompanied with turbulent feelings, - these are some of narcissistic cardinal symptoms, Dr. Maaz wrote of. About this time Madam Chancellor reveals such specific character of narcissistic patients as difficulty with empathy. In an effort to 'throw Helmut Kohl over the bridge' she dragged his wife into the scandal, while being her best friend and knowing about Hannelore's critical condition. People could observe a classic expression of this symptom two years ago during a televised debate on the refugee problem in the city of Rostock. A dispassionate move-to-tears of paralyzed Palestinian child touched feelings of the mass media and social networks. This was a show where Mrs. Merkel demonstrated lack of tact, as well as inability to show compassion and any art of acting.
  
It is worth noting that less than two months after the TV broadcast Mrs. Merkel announced opening borders for refugees and migrants. This decision compelled Dr. Maaz to try to warn about pathological behavior of the chancellor. Because of those sudden swings of the political course of the powerful decision-maker even an unsophisticated layperson cannot help but think of his mental health. Dr. Maaz just conducted additional behavioral analysis and made an anticipated forecast, denouncing an imminent psychological or psychosomatic collapse.
  
Therefore he delicately dissembled the fact of concurrently developing tokens of another much more serious personality disorder. There is every reason to believe that Angela Merkel has not been spared depression. That is a mental affection of all public people who suffer from constant psychological pressure and forced daily regime as well as eating disturbance. Mrs. Merkel is aware about her malady and tries to cope with the disease using both medical treatment and ordinary alcohol for relaxation. It's no coincidence that her most well-known images are with liquor in her hand or with her hands resting in front of her stomach in the Merkel diamond witnessing unsociable demeanour.
  
Recently the chancellor became [aware about Germans' psychic health within labour protection](http://www.lead-digital.de/aktuell/work/merkel_bei_depression_sind_wir_alle_entwicklungslaender) and appealed employers to legalize depression, if the expression may be tolerated. It is at least odd to see the concern for the latent depressed on the part of the woman who had forced tears from a paralytic child's eyes. This comprehension is possible just given that she experienced similar sufferings of a depressed person. Also such somatic disorders as kidney breakdown (baggy skin below eyes), gastrointestinal disorders (sallow complexion) and recurrent weight changes imply depression. They might be just a side effect of antidepressant and neuroleptic treatment, or they could be a sign of psychotic depression. 
  
In view of the above Mrs. Merkel's statement that Germany and Europe should paddle their own canoe and 'take our fate into our own hands,' I'm afraid, is an outcome of spring acerbation of the deep depressive personality disorder. It may safely be said that disastrous result of her open door policy, conducted with actual narcissistic derealization and anosognosia, led to logical depressive result. Morbid inability to acknowledge mistakes forces Mrs. Merkel to assert herself by means of exaggeration of her own significance and laying blame for her mistakes on others.
  
On this basis it is possible to honestly conclude that the present Germany's chancellor suffers from several progressive personality disorders. In this connection I strongly recommend to stop neglecting the problem, but to recognize it and urge efforts to combat it. It must be remembered that a narcissist in depression is no less dangerous than a patient suffering from any other psychotic pathology. Narcissist in depression at power is twice as dangerous.

33,"I just wrote a huge text called ""i'm tired."" however i didn't express myself totally because it would made the huge text enourmous text and did not want that.

Also if you're having anykind of paranoia or anxiety i would not recommend you reading my post i know it sounds weird because when i tried talking to people about it they got creeped out.

Firstly i want to emphasize that i know i have paranoia and i know i am delusional, to this point i already accepted it, because nobody wanted to help so i just ""got over it"".

The results aren't that bad really, only some delusions and paranoid throughts but i believe it can get worse after awhile, hallucinations really don't help at all.

It really gets harder to sleep and wake up for example when i try to sleep i keep heaving footsteps in the celling, basement, the whole house keeps making footstep noises it really jolts me awake and i grab my wooden cane and do rounds around the house.

While making rounds around the house 2 days ago i saw some pale blsck dressed woman staring at me so i ran in her direction to beat her ass up for invading my house but out of nowhere she dissapeared that made me mad cause i really got all ready to confront someone then i discover it's just my imagination.

And heck it gets scary when the auditory hallucinations kick in, i hear music, people laugh, claps, hisses, you name it, it scares me because it is something new to me it will take time to get adjusted.

Today this morning i heard hercules from dbz telling me to stop sleeping and to wake up cause i am lazy, that was kinda funny in a way.

It gets kinda hard to wake up because my brain can't differentiate a dream and real life so he decides not to wake me up, if i wake up i end up sleeping again because i get confused.

For example i had a dream that i was in my house taking care of two living baby dolls it was so realistic that i woke up and i went to sleep again the dream returned and when i woke up for real i was happy looking for the baby dolls..yeah i know it sounds kinda creepy.

But in my dream i was torturing them and laughing about it, i throught that the dolls where real so i looked for them unfortunaly they were not real..

Also it gets hard to sleep with the feeling that someone is watching you or after you at tines i kept up until 3 AM it really can affect your sleeping routine.

But i don't need to fear anymore i will live in the basement of my house where there are no windows so that nobody watches me and i can lock the basement.

Deep inside my mind i know this behavior is destructive but i cannot get help my family does not like the idea of being sane because of red flag stuff i really don't know what to do.

Even if i could get help i would feel like i am being changed and why would i trust some psychologist?, they probably are some government sent robot to lock me up in a cage for crazy people.

And trust me i am sane i know what i am doing, believe me or not i got sent to a mental clinic because of stupid voices i heard, gosh i was so stupid to trust a psychologist that really does not know what she is doing.

I met all sorts of ""people"" there, drug addicts, suicidal people, people that ran away from home, people that beated up there own parents, people that have dead friends you name it.

After 3 days i got out of there and my parents screamed at me calling all sorts of things, sure i will get a degree in psychology and i will abandom my family they never helped me only kept criticising me for doing things i don't have any control over.

When i was depressed i remember having throughts that i swear i almost heard them telling me to split my arm open, i almost did it.

Not only that but some asshole always gives you bad advice when you are sad.

""Well you have a house food and clothes stop whinning""

""Stop whinning get over it""

""BE HAPPY""

Etc, because of people like that my depression got weird and probably steered off to psychosis, i appreciate that my brain made a world where everybody loves me and don't jugde me.

It even affected my emotions, i never really liked them because my whole family kept ridiculling me because for a male i was to emotional.

It pisses me off cause i kept punching myself not to feel emotions because of these mere robots sent by the government..

This will be my last post about psychosis because why should i complain about something that is a part of me.

And no don't try to pep talk me out of my little world.

34,"Hey all.

I tortured a bug just now. I don't know what species it is, it looks like a giant flying ant. I broke its wings first so that it couldn't fly away. Then I started to cut off its legs and antennae bit by bit. It was interesting to watch the bug crawling around with it's limbs.

Then I suddenly realized something is wrong with me. Why did I do this? It's totally unnecessary and time wasting.

I don't know. I just wanna do it.

It wasn't the first time I tortured a bug or animal. Actually, this was nothing compared to what I had done before. I always have the desire to torture living things. There are a lot of wild cats around my dorm building and every time I saw one I want to kick it. But I can't do that because I usually walk with my friends and they love those cats. I even planned to go out in midnight and lure one cat to a remote place then kill it. I've never really done it tho, simply because I need to sleep.

However, I did tortured some cats before. When I was a child, my granny used to have many pet cats. I like those cats actually, I loved to play with them, and adults thought so as well. But I would grab their tails, spin around several times, then let them go and hit the wall. I did this when there's no adults around, of course. Yes, I knew it was not right, but I can't help it. It's like there is some tremendous desire within me to drive me to do so.

When I was six or seven, I threw my pet rabbit out from sixth floor. My dad took it back and it amazingly survived for another two days. I managed to made my parents believed that my rabbit somehow jumped out by itself. I also tortured my fathers pet fish, I took them out of water, held it until it's almost died, then put it back for several seconds and took it out again...I like to catch bugs and feed them to spiders, see them struggling and die. Mosquitoes is the specie that is "" legal "" to hate. I have a special skill to catch mosquitoes alive, my father and I invited many kinds of death penalty for them, like burning, drowning, cutting off their mouthparts... It was really a fun thing to do with my dad. But when it comes to other animals, I gotta do it secretly by myself.

Now the serious question is, do I have the same desire to human? The answer is yes.

To be clear, I've never murdered anyone. But I indeed tortured some. They are kids, I always make sure they are either too young to remember anything (like my cousin, he was six months old and ten years younger than me), or too afraid of me to tell adults (like the little girl from my neighbor family, we are of the same age). I won't go details about what I did to them, I don't want any follows. But I could tell how those kids hurt from their screams and cries. And tbh, I enjoy it.

Those memories are all from years ago, I barely do these things now, I guess it's because I'm older and gained more control over myself ( I just turned 18). That kind of desire still exists, but I buried it deeper and I certainly don't want to get any trouble from that. The strange thing is, I never thought there could be something wrong with me, until just now.

Because I was preparing for a exam and torture that bug wasted me about half a hour. It's not worthy, and I began to doubt that my behavior is not rational. Now I even waste nearly one more hour to write this and think about it, so...

Do I need help? I'm not sure :(

Thanks for reading this anyway. As to the bug, I will kill it tomorrow morning, if it's still not dead by then.",14Jun2017,2

37,"Hi. It's my first time posting on this sub, so I'm expecting (hopefully) good results.

I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and anxiety for a couple months now and something else is popping up. This is, an alternate personality. Her name is Tuesday and takes control of my body and sometimes my own mind. 
I have told my therapist, but they say it's just my schizophrenia, which I think it is not.
I have a small history of emotional abuse, but that is unknown, as I cannot remember much of my past.
When Tuesday takes over it feels like a blackout. Just completely gone. It has turned violent, sadly. I have cuts down my wrist and feet from her taking control. But she says she just wants to protect me. And she did, Five years ago. I love her, but I also despise her. I have no idea what to do. My parents don't believe me either.
If anyone has any ideas, feel free to share.",14Jun2017,1

So lately i've noticed that everything i do gets me to the point when i just dont care at all. I've been struggling a lot because of many different things like school, new friends, family, new environment etc. I used to be really happy and outgoing but now i just feel like ive changed a lot and i dont know what to think about myself anymore. Everyday i just feel like im suffering but i cant see the reason why. From what i heard reddits community is really helpful and im looking forward to hear about your opinion about my behaviour 😀.",14Jun2017,2

42,"I'm in a low place. I suffer from really bad body dysmorphia and anxiety that seems to be turning into really bad (bad for me - on the outside I just look moody/easily irritable and a little withdrawn) bouts of depression. I think therapy is a good step for me. I usually have things ""under control"". I have a lot of responsibility that I handle really well but I want to be mentally healthy.
To elaborate: I am going to be upgrading my degree in psychology eventually to a masters that will allow me to practise as a psychologist. However, I worry that seeking therapy in a relatively small town, will impact my ability to get a job in the future. Hence my question.",14Jun2017,3
43,"Okkk... Here we go

1. I'm a mess but I'm not close to swallowing a bullet or doing and an John Belushi eight-ball to end it all. 

2. I've had insurance in the past but just haven't wanted to admit I have a problem.   I'm getting to the point thou in my life I need to do something 

3. Here's my issue. I have no drive, no ambition, no purpose, and most importantly no confidence. Think of this, your lying on the couch in your house, you smell smoke, the house is burning like crazy but you have no interest in getting your fat ass of the couch to put out the fire. That's my life currently but the fire has gotten so bad it's destroyed the house and working on destroying the entire neighborhood while I stay on the couch looking at the ceiling. I'm dead inside. And I can't figure out a way to get myself going. 

4. I finally acknowledge I've got a serious issue. In the last 6 months its been passed along to me or by strangers in conversations ""WTF is wrong with that guy"" Not in a bad way. Just why is he in the place he is when he could be doing so much better. 

5.  Lastly and the most annoying issue I have is not only am I dead inside but I'm paralyzed by indecision and lack of confidence. The indecision is killing me, I know this but I can't do a damn thing about it. and of course the lack indecision goes hand in hand with major self confidence issues

So I finally want to try and fix this.  Or at least talk to someone where I can give them my whole story.  So I have choices obviously

Should I look under the option for Behavorial Health?  Or just got to straight Psychologist? What type of psychologist?  Just a basic clinical one?

One thing about me is I do come from a loving home.  No abuse in either home or relationship setting.  I don't do drugs thou I've toyed with the idea of smoking weed I binge drink a bit on the weekend but generally remember what I do the next day and really don't do anything embarassing or dangerous.  and while this has been going on for 10 plus years I'm not really sure why its happening.  Just need some help picking out what type of medical professional  I should see.  ",14Jun2017,1
44,"I'm reaching out because I need advice/tips/support. Ever since high school (I'm in my early thirties now), I've felt constantly tired. It affects nearly every aspect of my life. It makes me too tired to be helpful. Too tired to feel motivated. It makes me take longer to do work-related tasks. It has effected relationships, hobbies/interests and even my employability. 

I could sleep an uninterrupted 8 hours and then feel EXHAUSTED an hour after I get up. 

Throughout this time I've suffered from depression, anxiety and ADD. I'm trying to figure out if it's related to these things, related to the medicine side effects, or if there's something wrong with how my body works. 

Right now I take Lamictal and Prozac. 

Nothing seems to perk me up too much. Because of my ADD, caffeine / coffee can actually have a reverse effect on me and actually calm me down and make me MORE tired. 

I know I need to exercise more but of course it's hard to want to exercise when you have no energy or drive. And I have a hard time thinking at 31 years old I don't have energy ever. Even after a restful night. 

I've recently realized my anxiety problems are a lot worse than I thought. Could the anxiety running in the back of my brain be draining me? Is it the depression? Is it the medicine? 

I've been using marijuana medicinally and that's helped a ton with monitoring and keeping anxiety in check but too much of it, depending on the strain, can make me sluggish too. It hasn't seemed to help me ""sleep deeper"" though so I'm wondering if my trouble even lies with the restfulness of me sleep. 

I'm looking for people with similar problems or know of similar problems and anything they've done to combat this chronic tiredness. Please share any remedies, diets, tactics, etc. if there's an exercise or tea or habit your swear by I'm all ears. 

I just want to feel different. I'm through being tired all the time. It's exhausting feeling exhausted. 

My best example of how I feel constantly is if someone woke you up in the middle of a nap and asked you to do something. That ""do something"" is my day to day life.

45,"Hey all.

I'm a 23 year old dude from Sweden. I will try to be as short and concise as possible. What I will tell you I'll refer to as ""The Condition"" and I've been experiencing this for 2 years, on and off. I've suffered a depression, which has more or less passed now and I've been relatively OK emotionally, except when The Condition and/or my current situation in life makes me depressed. 


During The Condition I have a hard time understanding things that I read, hear or see (books, tv, conversations, video-games). The Condition comes and goes. A couple of months ago I felt relatively good intellectually but then I started to play a video-game that had lots of dialogue and cutscenes (cinematics) that ignited The Condition. I began taking screenshots of every dialogue and then go through the pictures, re-watching cutscenes on youtube as well as reading up on the story which I had progressed that far (i.e not reading everything, as to not spoil the story) to verify that I had understood everything or to see if I had missed anything and this in turn affected every other area; books, movies, retarded actions etc. Even the most trivial things I can have a hard time understanding. Everything from single sentences to contexts. I'll try to post some examples later that are made-up or when I encounter something that should be easy to comprehend. I also tend to re-read things over and over, obviously when I don't understand something but when I do as well. It feels like I have a lack of focus during The Condition. 


While suffering from The Condition I have a tendency to explain things I see, read or hear even though I understand it. This is something I can combat by saying to myself ""If you understand, don't explain"" or ""Fuck it, you understand, move on"". Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. So I have control over this aspect, more or less. But what I can't control is my ability to understand things. 

If I drink alcohol or smoke cannabis during The Condition, I feel normal again. When sobering up, I might feel normal for a couple of days until the condition returns, either as strong as before or even worse. So it seems as if video-games that are story-based, drugs and other things triggers it. When it began two years ago, I later came to the conclusion that it was cannabis that triggered it and therefore I didn't smoke for 5-6 months but during that period it came and went anyway. Then I smoked again and it didn't trigger it.

The Condition varies in it's nature. The only two consistent aspects is what I've explained above. Sometimes I do lots of stupid things, like placing bread in the fridge (not really, a bad example but it'll do) or other stupid practical things that I either just do in a retarded way or in a unnecessarily complicated way. Worse memory as well. Another thing, which almost never happens during The Condition anymore and if it does I just tell myself to stop, is that I used to count and think about retarded things I had done during the day. I also have a harder time phrasing myself, which is evident in this post (repeating words, not using the most optimal words..) 


Also noticed that the more I think about it, the worse it gets. I have been thinking about writing about this for several months now, but I didn't want to do it when I was free from The Condition out of fear that it would return or I didn't do it during The Condition because I was too lazy or indifferent. When The Condition appears after a period of being normal, I get scared and think thoughts like ""Not again.. No, no. Why?"" and other things and I try to shake it off. Sometimes it works but sometimes it's like I'm thinking about various things related to The Condition even if I'm not, like it's in the background, even if I'm actually thinking about whatever. 


I have talked about it with a psychologist and she said that I appear observative, analytical etc. I continued talking about it during every meeting and finally she said ""OK then, maybe you are ""stupid"" right now. But it won't last forever. It's probably a phase you're going through right now because of stress"". But I don't feel stressed. 


Another thing is that I never think about anything philosophical anymore. I only think about trivial/banal matters, like what I should to tomorrow, which movie I should watch. When friends start talking about serious matters like politics, psychology or whatever, I can jump into the discussion and make arguments. I have always been interested in intellectual subjects like history, psychology, crimonology etc. I don't form opinions anymore when reading something in a newspaper (which I rarely do) or a forum. I don't think as deeply as before and I don't reflect as much. This is present regardless if I'm affected by The Condition or not, but during The Condition it's probably less reflection and deep thinking than otherwise. I am however very self-aware, which not only I have concluded but others as well because I can reflect a lot about myself.


Am I suffering from a psychosis? If not, what is it? Or have my brain become damaged in some way and I'll just have to accept it and live with it? 


Thing is, if it would be a psychosis or some kind of disease, why does it vary? It just sounds illogical that it would be anything like that because of the irregularity. 


If The Condition would have been affecting me every day I would probably have killed myself. This morning I experienced my first real suicide thought since the depression I had 2½-3 years ago. Because of it's irregular nature, I still have some hope. 


I said in the beginning of the post that I would try to be as short and concise as possible. Well, this isn't short nor concise but it's the best I can do. I could add a lot more examples, experiences and stuff than I already have. 

I'm sincerely grateful for replies.

49,"Mental health issues can be extremely profound and I'm not trying to simplify anyones problems by saying a generic little tablet can fix them, but I've found taking a vitamin to be very helpful. 

About 6 months ago I was getting really nervous all the time. I couldn't look at the sky without fearing I'd fall into it, I'd get ""electric shock"" type impulses that would make my body jolt in class, and I was overall a nervous wreck but then I realized I wasn't getting nutrients. I eat pretty well but don't eat much fruit or veggies and I drink a ton of water. As soon as I started taking a vitamin my anxiety got a lot better. I still have issues but by getting nutrients or the placebo effect, I'm doing a lot better now. I feel the need to mention this because vitamins are cheap and not much of a commitment as opposed to SSRI's or therapy. I fucking hate when people say exercise and eating right can fix my mental health issues, because it suggests my problems are easily solvable, but a healthy diet and some Flintstones gummies might just get you on your way.

50,"Hello! I'm an 18 year old girl from the US and I've been having some trouble lately that I hope you could give me some advice about. I don't want to self-diagnose here, but I've had issues with feelings of hopelessness and lack of self-worth pretty much since middle school. I've also had trouble falling asleep since high school. However, recently, I started to hear noises that I don't think are really there early in the morning that have caused me great distress and force me to stay awake.

Now, I might sound crazy so bear with me here. I sometimes hear music outside starting between 3-5 AM that everyone in my family assures me they don't hear. It's like muffled jazz that I thought came from the neighbors. Whatever, it's no big deal. Then I started hearing the Islamic call to prayer around the same time and I thought maybe I need to start praying. That doesn't happen anymore, but now I hear a tapping sound like footsteps that gets louder and louder if I ignore it to the point where I feel like it's in my room (I sleep in the basement). If I look for the source of the noise, it stops until I get back in bed. It comes from two different places but if I look at the place where I sometimes think it's coming from it stops. When I look away, it starts again. Last night it really freaked me out so I had to go upstairs and try to sleep on the couch but I hear it there as well. I ended up not sleeping until a family member woke up and I slept in their bed. 

This is also accompanied by a really strong feeling that something bad is going to happen for the past month-ish.  I'm no stranger to this feeling, but it never lasts this long. It usually goes away after a day or two. Now it's like all I think about. 

I'm going to set up a consultation appointment with the counselors at my university, but I don't even know where to begin describing this. I could tell them how I have trouble in social situations or how I don't sleep, but I feel like they might think I'm making up the part about the noises. I swear that they sound very real to me though. Do you guys have any suggestions on how to go about describing this? Sorry for the wall of text, I had to tell someone though. ",14Jun2017,2
