1,"Hello,

I have long thought that therapy would be very beneficial to me due to extremely high levels of stress, bouts of loneliness due to travel, and several other reasons. Since I travel so much it would not be feasible for me to keep solid appointments with a therapist in person. Does anyone have recommendations for services that are affordable and offer therapy by phone? Thanks!",12Feb2017,2

3,"I dont really know why im doing this but i need to vent... (edit: I actually do care if you read it please help, it might not be easy to read it, its just a wall of text, my thoughts but yeh i guess it is what it is)

I dont know what to do. I feel like i could lay down, not even sleep, just lay there and never get up, just fade away into nothingness. Like what does it even matter anyway? My brain feels so foggy, like i cant form a single coherent thought, im supposed to be writing an essay but nothing is working. I just feel like i kind of want to die. Im feel detached from my body like things just happen but uhh i dont know. Its not like i dont have friends, well they say their friends but the amount of times they just fuck me over like its nothing after i do literally anything for them is actually kinda funny. I do sport and all that. I stopped smoking weed and taking all drugs because i literally dont even have the motivation to do that anymore haha. I keep all my emotions locked up inside this is the first time ive talked about how i feel in probably like 8 years haha, i seriously dont think i could even if i tried. I used to get in fights and shit but i dont even do that anymore because i literally dont care. I still box really intense pretty much every day, i didnt loose alot of fight. Also my parents really hated it when i came home with cuts and bloody fists... I just dont care. about anything. Ive got so much work to do and i just feel like i dont care. Its so hard to do it when my brain just wont work, like what am i supposed to do, my teachers wont understand when i tell them ""I didnt do the essay you told me to because i literally couldn't form a single coherent sentence for 3 hours of staring at a book"" I actually dont know what to do at all. I need help, but i hate getting help, with anything because i know i can do shit by myself. But its really all getting to much. I see all these fake people and i feel an actually sense of disgust at pretty much everything. Im happy sometimes, well i guess its happiness? but its never for more than 10 minutes and then im just fucking pissed off or completely dead. Disclaimer im not going to see a shrink, no way. I really dont know what to do.

Edit: i think my friends might know theres something wrong, a few of them have asked if im alright and i just say yes... I think im acting a little strange at school and that, i usually try to hide it and ive done a pretty good job the last couple years but im really starting to get sloppy. also im 18 in last year of highschool and i really need to get good grades but i seriously feel like my mental state is letting me down and i just dont know what to do. 

Edit: Ive come close to having girlfriends, like ill talk to them everyday till 12pm for a month and then when it gets to a point ill just completely stop and i think they really hate me for it and im pretty sure alot of the girls i know really dont like me because if this. Im not scared of much, but im terrified of having a real connection with someone and i just cant talk about myself. I just evade everyones questions about myself and my feelings or give really vague answers ""im fine"" "" a little sick but ill be good"" and go on to talk about them so i dont have to talk about myself.

4,"{Wall o' text warning.  Just had to get this all out, and hopefully I will get some advice or kind words.  Also rambling warning.  Also strong language warning.}

Fear is beginning to consume me.  I overthink every little detail in life and consider every possibility, and the bad shows, and with all the bad, I know that there is very little I can do to stop much of it.  But I still lock my door no matter what, and I still check my nooks and closets every time I come home, adding in my urge to carry a knife wherever I go, a very big one if I can hide it.

I can't shake the idea that everything moves and changes form when I'm not looking, and that the bigger surfaces like walls open doors to the rest of reality, and that at any given moment, entities from beyond might decide to seize me and take me away.  Reality exists outside of human perception, and we know because of the Observer Effect that matter acts in a way that we have no way of knowing.

Most everyone I meet might be a murderer.  They could be, right?  I can't read their minds.

The government very well might be watching me, and taking notes, and retaining all my information in a database, to take me away to bury me in a shallow grave, or to conduct experiments on me, or to throw me in a cell and leave me to rot.  Why wouldn't they?  We know they've been keeping information like that in the U.S. in something called the Main Core sine the 80s, and we know that they're not always the most legal-acting individuals.

And, worst of all, I might lose my wife.  Something, someone, might kill her, or even worse, she might leave me, for whatever reason.  Why not?  I'm slowly losing my mind, I can be selfish and untrustworthy, and I scare her with my outbursts of anger and violent language, even if I don't feel all that mad.

With all the nuclear warheads on the Earth, we as a species could be wiped out in 45 minutes, less even.  How do I know some crazy person hasn't obtained the launch codes?  How do I know that there's not some dark shadowy organization planning to do just that?

All these things and more haunt me.  Often, I'm scared.  Often, I feel hopeless and useless.  Often, I feel as if everyone is just as hopeless and useless, and that we're all hiding from the truth of death, of The End, and ignoring it, and tomorrow morning it will be revealed that we were all just in a coma induced by demons beyond the stars to watch us, and that the plan on discarding us when we ""die"".

Sometimes I feel as if everyone else of useless and pathetic, subhuman and deserving of death, and that myself and a few select others given Visions (as I call them in my journal) will be left to rebuild.  Sometimes this makes me sad, and sometimes I accept this with a calm determination, and feel as if I could do it.

Fear turns to an energy that sends lightning through my veins and gives me goosebumps; yes, all these things will come to pass, soon, and the world will be engulfed in flames and death, and all societies and cultures will be uprooted, and all the lies people tell themselves will be revealed, but to late, as The End is coming, and they will all die.  But that's okay, *good*, even, for that is the way life in our tiny part of the Aleph-Naught ( another term I've used in my journals to describe infinity and all within it), and that it will mean evolution for humanity.  Or, at the very least, the creatures left behind.

I am oftentimes frightened that God is going to kill me in my sleep, or that He is going to send my wife out the window of a car.

My thoughts have always been disorganized, but now I can describe them only as screaming, and not just one long cry; it is warbled and gurgled and has less-than and more-than human voices in it.

Sometimes everything seems to go flat, kind of.  Not really literally, but what I mean by that is that everything suddenly seems very empty of life and light and purpose, and very slightly blurred.  Somewhere between a dream and being high.

One moment I'll be dancing and skipping and singing and the next I have to cope with my dark dark thoughts by joining them and accepting their inexorable nature, either feeling calm and determined to make it or feeling sadistic and cruel because I'll get to watch all these fools and liars and sinners burn, before I join them, laughing all the way.

I can't stop smoking, and dear heavens have I tried.  But however many nicotine patches or gums or Zyn pouches I try to replace them with, I keep returning to those fucking evil things.

At work I sometimes feel the presence of a spider-like, metallic creature hiding in the corner.  He is very large, but harmless.  He is curious, really.  I actually feel comforted by him, even if gender likely doesn't even apply to ""him"".  And I call him spiderish and metallic, but that's really all I can call him, because try as I might to imagine him, I cannot fully.

He is likely a passer-by, doing whatever it is the beasts from the Aleph-Naught do, stopped to watch us.

Vertigo is how I feel sometimes.  That's a good way of putting it.  The flatness.  I'm feeling it right now.  I glanced to my overheaped ashtray and suddenly things went blurry for a second, and the flatness is here.  Part of me believes that this is my consciousness breaking through the thin veils or reality, and the only way I can find comfort is by reminding myself that humans are unimaginably insignificant, and that any creatures from the void probably don't even know we're here, and thus one in a septillion millions whatever might even notice us, one in a septillion tethrarxigigas 'OIBG419P820 MIGHT notice me, and that that creature likely isn't malicious per se, and probably won't think to take me, because why would it, we don't take pick up little grains of dust very often, do we?

I like to imagine that the spider thing protects me, for some reason, but probably not.  

I don't feel afraid, now.  But everything is still empty.

I have wen to a training clinic, and they can do a full psychevaluation and diagnosis for $75, which isn't bad at all, but that won't come till the next week or so, and I'm feeling odd, so I'm venting.

I've had dysthymia for more than a decade, and it escalated into major depression.  Those two were the only ones diagnosed, but I suspect psychotic depression, or even, God help me, some sort of schizophrenia.  

Is there any more that I can give you that will help you understand?  Anything at all?  I draw pictures and make videos and write stories; I can show you them I CAN'T FUCKING COMMUNICATE WITH ANYONE.  Not even my closest friends, my wife, and my new therapist.  I can't even communicate with myself.

I feel very sad and also angry, but the anger has nowhere to go, because I don't blame them.  My wife, the most precious thing in all of creation, tries to ignore these things as much as she can without hurting me.  She's not abusive or neglecting, it's not like I can't talk to her at all or like she ignore me when I'm having an episode, but she is frightened of me.  She asked me to take my drawings down because they frighten her, but I find that they help get the ugly out, and that hanging them up is kind of like a trophy I earned in taking down some evil inside.

Sometimes I think I have such strong emotions because I'm connected to all the infinite versions of me in the Aleph-Naught, and that I feel theirmy pain and suffering.

This is interesting, as intimidating as it is.  I am intelligent.  I don't mean to brag or sound arrogant, but I know that I am.  My IQ is between 125 and 135.  Part of me loves this.  Sitting here, trying to figure out what's going on, making this archive as if I'm taking notes.

My temples are throbbing.

Please, any advice or kind words would be appreciated beyond words.  I feel sad and hopeless again.  I know this is a big post but I hope at least one of you will read it.  I'm this close to begging.  I will provide for yu anything.  Anything I've made, you can see.  You can read my journal, if you want.

My wife is away.  I find that I feel like this oftntimes when she's gone.  I have to be up at four in the morning tomorrow, but I don't care.  I feel that sleep is a weakness and that I wish I could overcoe it.

Many of you have been amazingly helpfu s far, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

My intelligence, I feel, is rotting.  My brain power is a big part o who I am, and again I don't want to seem arrogan, but I don't want to lose what I've made one of my defining features.

Now I sort of want some creature from beyond to take me.  Maybe they will show me great things.  Maybe they will take me away from the imperfections of humanity, of me.

But probably not.

Try to have a nice night and morning and forever.  I will.",12Feb2017,2

6,"Hi reddit :)

I’ll try to describe the situation and keep it short and concise. 
Also I am a reddit newbie so I apologise if I have broken any rules.

* My brother has been battling depression/mental health from the age of 17 (as to what I can tell). He is now 31.
* He was a talented, popular, life of the party, good looking bloke, a ‘natural’ at all board sports and a great musician.
* He finished high school at the age of 17 then completed a 4 year Electrical apprenticeship.
* Toward the end of the apprenticeship the early signs of low self esteem were beginning. 
* Always doubting himself, asking family members if he 'was an idiot' or 'sounded like a dickhead’.
* He completed the apprenticeship but has not worked since.
* Lives with my parents in the same bedroom he grew up in.
* He daily routine is this: sleep until midday, drink 1 litre of coffee, go back to his room, closed the door, closed the blinds until dark. Once complete darkness, he takes the family dogs for a walk for 1 hour. Sometimes taking a skateboard with him. Then eats dinner that my mother cooks by himself in his room. 
* He has a tablet with wifi. But other than that I cannot get into the room (he locks it) to see what else it in there.
* He never goes out in public. He rarely talks to my parents.
* I feel like my parents are “enabling” him to continue this down this path. 
* They feel that he is going to “snap out of it” one day and that is all that can be done. They provide him kind of healthy food, fuel, a car and free rent. 
* He is incredibly skinny almost malnourished.
* He rarely talks to me. 
* I have been to multiple mental health facilities here in Australia over the years to see what can be done. I have been told that unless he is physically hurting himself or others there is legally nothing that I can do.
* I feel it has been long enough and some drastic change has to occur, eg get the men in the white coats to forcibly remove him to a mental health facitliy. Whether or not that is a good idea, I am not sure. 
* I have been living in a different city and overseas, but try to visit as much as I can.

Has anyone else been in this situation and is there anything I can do to help?

8,"Growing up, I escaped into alternate realities to avoid trauma. 
I would often straight up dissociate, or use books and television as a safe place.

Recently after meditating and soul searching, I realise that despite having a safe life now, I am still using that same defense mechanism. I realise that I have a fear of silence.

I have found my self constantly reaching for my phone scrolling pointlessly and reading random comments, or ill be listening to podcasts, audio books or music - all in an attempt to avoid the thoughts that are rolling around in my mind. 

It works, but I never get a chance to get to know my mind.

On top of that, I have found that social media has a strong addictive quality - there is apull to check notifications and what your friends are doing. So much so, that I will reach for my phone often 'just to check'.

With that in mind, I released a podcast episode discussing my 'fear of silence', as well as a desire to move towards a more mindful existence.

Let me know what you think!

9,"Yes. It's a clickbait title. Since I rarely post on reddit I wanted to get the attention of as many people as I could to get a response.

I'll try to keep this as short &amp; to the point as possible. I'm 21, live in Australia on the east coast, grew up in Sydney and lived there until I was 18. Lost my father at a young age at 13. I've been battling depression for almost 5 years since I was 16. I moved 2 hours away from my hometown at 18 &amp; my depression got much worse. I stopped seeing friends, stopped going out, stopped talking to people which led to dealing with anxiety issues which led to social anxiety due to isolating myself. (Among other symptoms)

I've recently started seeing a psychologist, getting out of the house more, I'm finally starting to feel like going out &amp; doing things. I want to meet people. I've been out more in January of this year than I have the past 2 years. Finally starting to feel 'normal'. 

However, I feel like there is one thing holding me back from reaching my full 'potential' per say. I still haven't reconnected with any of my old friends. I haven't posted anything on my personal social media accounts (Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat) since I first moved in late 2014. Haven't spoken to any friends since then &amp; haven't seen them either. Some have reached out to me but I never replied. 

For some reason I'm still afraid to reach out to them because I know that will eventually lead to meeting up with them in person. I'm even afraid to post anything on social media from fear of them seeing it &amp; reaching out to me. Because I know this will lead down the same route. I haven't made any new friends since moving from my hometown, haven't worked or studied &amp; basically feel like a complete failure. I’m afraid of what they will say, think or feel about me.

The excuses my mind makes up are numerous, some include:
- Needing to be a better version of myself before I talk to them/see them (Working/Studying/Training/Have Friends)
- Not being a good enough version of myself.
- Fear of judgement from them.
- Fear of failing (making an idiot of myself)

What do I do to overcome this? Reading back what I've written it seems pretty clear to me that to overcome this is I just have do what I'm most afraid of. Like any fear, the only way to overcome it is to do it. Particularly irrational fears..

Any help/feedback would seriously be appreciated. I feel stuck in a rut mentally, I want to be able to post on my social media like I used to - I want to be able to talk to old friends without this fear.

TLDR; I've struggled with depression/anxiety for almost 5 years. Too afraid to post on my personal social media accounts from fear of old friends reaching out to me. I know I won't reply because I'm too scared to talk to them/meet up with them. What do I do?",12Feb2017,0

11,"As the title suggests; I'm currently researching new medication to suggest to my psych to put me on. I'm happy with the cocktail that I'm on to keep me out of manic episodes but in the past few days I'm sinking deeper into depression fuelled by my other diagnosis (a type of OCD) meaning I haven't left the house since December and it's just getting worse. My moods also seem to be getting a bit more labile and it feels like my cycling is picking up speed as my mood is shifting every few hours. I have had episodes in the past of rapid-cycling.

I'm currently on Latuda 74 mg, Abilify 10mg and Lithium 1125mg, all these were great to get me out of a mixed manic psychotic episode in November last year but now they're too sedating and not dealing with my depression or OCD and I feel myself falling very rapidly into depression with suicidal plans. Studies seem to show promising results for depression and OCD with clomipramine, I would like to ask my psych to take this alongside Abilify and Topamax.

12,"Something weird has been happening with me and I can't find any explanation for it. It started last spring when I was having these weird memory problems. It was usually the names of things like bands, movies, and every now and then even people I knew. I would think of something in my mind and know exactly what it was, but no matter how long and hard I thought about it, the name would never come to me. Once I even forgot what 2x4 was and ended up thinking that it was 16.

This died down for a while although I still felt like my concentration and memory were still degraded, but recently it's started to come back. I've been having a lot of concentration problems in the past month and I don't know what to do about it. Today I also started having trouble with my speech, like mixing up the first letters of words that were next to each other.

The only drugs I've used are weed and DXM, not heavily or frequently. I drink moderately about once every week or two on average.

15,"Hi Reddit.

I'm 17 years old and I'm a senior in high school.
Long story short, I've been dumped by two girls over the last year and a half, and both of them have cited my rapid mood changes and unpredictable anger. When I say anger, I don't mean violence—I have not hit anybody. But often I would get very incensed over little things, or things I would not even be mad about normally. For example, one of the girls (while we were out together) didn't want to lend me 2 dollars. I got really angry about this, and for a moment I wanted to hurt her feelings. Knowing that this was happening again, I walked away to calm down—and I realized that I wasn't even mad after all, and that something had just seemed to take over temporarily. Normally I wouldn't even be mad about such a thing!

Both girls described the angry me as mutating into a ""different person"" that they ""don't know"". And they just wanted me to go back to being ""the real [me]"".

Having heard these words now twice from two girls who have never met each other, I'm starting to worry that this issue may be REAL thing. So to speak. 

I can't go through life hurting the people I care about like this. Something needs to be done. I am thinking of talking to a therapist but I felt like coming here first. 

And here's some additional information that might be relevant: I've been depressed before. In the years following my parents divorce, I had trouble going through daily life. On top of that, after the divorce, my dad fell into alcohol and treated my brothers and I very poorly. We were subjected to unreasonable amounts of physical torment and yelling, to the point where my mom nearly brought my dad to court, despite his financial upper-hand. He got his shit together now, but my brothers and I were young and impressionable during this phase and my fear of him has not left me. To be noted, I feel like I'm HIM when I'm angry.

I feel like I'm in a catch 22, where I won't get the help I need without emphasizing just how desperate I am, but at the same time doing that risks being locked up, which won't help me at all. 

I've heard too many stories about what happens when you confess to being suicidal in a hospital. They treat you like shit and lock you up for days. I will NOT let that happen to me. If they do that to me it won't save me it will drive me completely over the edge. 

Somehow I have to make it clear this is an emergency without them sicking the cops on me. Already my counselor has seriously considered having me committed to protect myself, but I told her whoever she sent better be armed for bear because I will fight. I will kill if I have to.

21,"Hi all. 

This is my first post on Reddit, I've read a few similar posts and I suppose I'm just reaching out. 

I've been struggling recently with some mental health issues that don't give any clear indication of what it might be. 

I'll start back a couple of years ago. I've suffered from various episodes in my life either due to my own actions or someone else. I don't want this to sound like a ""poor me story"". I know I'm accountable for my actions and not everybody is out to get me. 

My father committed suicide 5-6 years ago, he was a pretty abusive person and had a lot of issues. I hadn't had any contact with him for two years prior to him hanging himself. He didn't like me as a child and took a lot of shit out on me. Obviously this caused me to have issues, I didn't really care about my wellbeing and took a lot of drugs and got in to some abusive relationships. 

When my old man topped himself I got a fairly large payout from an insurance policy, back then I was very impulsive and ended up wasting it on coke, weed, cars and women. I got in to a lifestyle that I couldn't really afford and ended up in a fair bit of debt. 

After a lot of therapy, meeting a nice girl (now single for different reasons) and a lot of hard work and will power I have curved my impulses. I no longer spend the money that I used to, I eat healthy and workout daily, I haven't touched coke in over 2 years or weed for 1 and am now clearing my debts. I have also started up my own business which is picking up and doing well. 

I seem to have gradually started to get my life on track. But I'm struggling mentally at the moment. I have good days and am pretty level headed (no mania), it's nice when I feel like that, just plateauing. But there are times throughout the week, days or even hours when my mood drops and I contemplate killing myself, It can really be quite scary. I get so low I change into a different person, I don't want to speak to anyone or even walk outside my front door. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong to feel that way when I've done everything to get my life to where it should be? I feel that there is always something I could be doing differently to make my life better and that any negative aspects of my life are because of my influence in some form or another.  

I've implemented so much change to different aspects of my life. I'm growing financially, professionally, socially and phyisically. I just can't seem to grow mentally, that seems to be the one thing always holding me back. 

I suppose I'm looking to talk about it with someone, because as much as people in my life say to talk about it, they don't really want to hear what's going on in my head.

For background, I'm in my 20s and have grown up being considered somewhat intelligent. With a combination of hardwork and luck, I've ended up in a high-performance, coveted role where I'm working 60-80 hours a week (not investment banking). The work I do is pretty interesting but I feel like my mind is almost always on full throttle at work (which is fine). Whenever I'm off of work though, I find myself to be constantly thinking, planning and analyzing everything around me. I am constantly mentally tired because of this. I get enough sleep (6-7 hours a night plus more on weekends), maintain a healthy fitness regimen, eat healthy and have an active social life. I consider myself to be very happy and on a simple level feel like I have what I need. I just don't know why my mind doesn't turn off.

My SO has a fear of doctors and a bad experience with one in her childhood (her therapist told her uBPD mom info that was supposed to be confidential), and thus finding the right one is very important. My SO is also worried about seeing one in the immediate area due to concerns about future employment, so having access to a list that covers some distance would be ideal (we live in a populated northeastern state, so I know there is lots of options). Lastly, we are worried about the logistics of insurance and other things related to setting up an appointment, as she has insurance through her parents (we are both young 20s) and she wishes to involve them as little as possible (ideally not at all).

Thank you for any help you can provide. I woyld really appreciate being able to finally get her the help she deserves. As a side note, if anyone can link to any (official) resource about HIPPA, that would be great. Part of my SO hesitancy revolves around this, and it definitely makes sense considering that past incident. If I could get her info from a credible source, I believe she might feel even more comfortable. Thanks again, and I hope this is the right place to post. ",12Feb2017,1

31,"There's no one I can see in my small town but I need help, preferably someone really really good at dealing with ptsd and anxiety. 

So where do you start? Google is unsurprisingly unhelpful at generic big picture searches like ""ptsd Skype psychologist"". Would yelp be worth looking at and then just contacting random therapists to see if they'll work over Skype?

Anyone want to pm me a rec? ",12Feb2017,5

33,"Okay, so I'm a teenager with Asperger's, depression, and social anxiety. My mother, as far as I can tell, does everything she's supposed to. So why do I cringe every time she touches me? Why can't I find any emotional attachment for her? I love my dad and my brother, just not her. I don't know what's wrong with me.",12Feb2017,5
34,"Throw away account-this question is for my husband who does not use Reddit...
He just ejaculated light Brown sperm. This is the first time, he is in no pain and it came out as it normally does. We read a bunch of things online but I'm wondering if anyone has any info to share? 
He is in his early thirties, is a little over weight but otherwise healthy. This is his first ejaculation in about a week as I've been on my period. We typically have sex at least once a week or more if he feels up to it. 
He is really stressing right now and I'm a little uneasy myself. Please, any information would be helpful guys. 
Thank you all.",12Feb2017,3
