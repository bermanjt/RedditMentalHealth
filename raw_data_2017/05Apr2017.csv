9,"Sometimes it's great. Sometimes I feel trapped and can't talk to anyone. 

My OH has adhd, is on meds but doesn't have great follow up care and is basically still self medicating with gaming, caffeine, exercise etc. He has tics that involve sniffing, blinking (common) and throwing his head back (rare). He suffers from severe health anxiety over quite routine 'illness things' and has asked me to call 999 over fairly minor things in the past such as minor stomach bugs, headaches, and tonight a episode of near fainting caused him to tell me 'i felt like I was going to die'. I have refused as i know this would be a serious waste of resources and although I'm not a Dr, have grown up with a life threatening condition and lots of medical professionals so I know 111 is our compromise. Even though I know people are probably not medically trained, following flowcharts and probably asking him to come in as a form of covering their backs (nothing serious has ever come from any of these episodes) and people notice his tendency to castrophaphise. I was pretty sure other was because he is low carbing and hadn't eaten dinner -  I have just been at the hospital and the nurse was very much in agreement, but did all the normal tests.

He used to self medicate with food and caffeine more and used to be 21 stone, is now 14. We have been together for nearly 8 years.

He routinely tells me when he feels stressed with minor things he wants to kill himself as no one cares because he's a 'white fat man'. When he says this I know he is doing it to be dramatic and subconsciously to make me feel guilty. I know he isn't actually immediately suicidal as i have offered to go with him to get help/phone crisis teams but he's always declined and said 'I don't mean it.'

He will say if anything happens he will pin the blame all on me and I've tried to support but now it's really grating and I'm fed up. He doesn't listen, and unknowingly is quite egocentric, but I know this is probably down to his conditions. 

For so long I have tried to help and support him by coming to Dr's, mental health nurse, physchiatrists, psychologists, helping him do cut, mindfulness, and try to take a deep breath and not let it get to me when he has a low point even when he's acting like a dick (sorry, but he's openly admitted this himself, but are you don't mind as your nice. I wanted to say, ffs I do mind and sick of being an emotional punchbag, but if I say that it will be thrown back at me.). The whole  oway I have supported him.

I don't have a halo, I'm messy, but I wouldn't say awfully so. I make sure house gets hoovered downstairs (Dog) at least every two days, kitchen tops wiped down, tidied, dry stuff put away, generally tidy, hang up wet stuff, put dry stuff away. Every couple of days I might might also tidy up upstairs/make bed. Once a week I might give the bathroom a quick scrub, hoover upstairs, wipe down skirting boards, dust surfaces etc. Every two weeks I might change bedding (or earlier if a bit stinky) and wash floors. 

We have a tiny house so rarely invite visitors, more likely to meet out and about. 

Mess is generally washing up, but I don't eat in the house alot and is generally mostly 'his' but he would never admit that. He has a habit of leaving plates, cups cutlery on our upstairs bookcase or eating in the bath and leaving the dirty stuff there. As a a result it doesn't exactly motivate me to try harder either. 

 I have the smallest room in the house as the bedroom (always seperate rooms due to me having severe auditory sensory issues) and it is untidy (sheets keep coming off bed, cover fell off duvet, and dirty clothes, bur not a massive amount in a pile, not even half or possibly a quarter of a wash). 

 He will often spit in the sink and leave snot/hair in the bath. 

 I have a active job and work full time-  hours (6/7 days a week, normally 5-7hrs out the house working+, 1-3hrs of admin when get back)  1-3 hrs walking own dog every day). This is my own business and I am regularly required to travel around the country (in the winter at least once a month, summer at least 2-4 or more times a month, ranging from Scotland to Cornwall). Sometimes my oh will stay at home, but sometimes we will try and make a mini holiday out of it.  

I can't drive due to a neurological l condition which makes organisation a bit hard, it's like I'm 24/7 mildly drunk! 

Sometimes he will blame me if something fails, like a washing machine gets clogged with a stray poo bag but I do try to check 3x before clothes go in. He has clogged it before with tissue, but apparently that was mine too.

As a result he screams and swears at it and starts shutting doors roughly, stomping etc and I feel horrible. I try my best to avoid situations like this as I am treading on eggshells and although I offer to help he basically replies as though I'm ruining his life and the cause of his MH issues. 

I really can't be failsafe, I've got severe short term memory issues but I try my best to avoid situations that stress him.

I'm fed up. Sometimes I do think I would be happier on my own but I can't afford to move out at the moment. I'm fed up of being his emotional punchbag when it all goes wrong, I can't do it anymore. Is this normal? Am I just weak?

When it's great, it's fabulous, and he can be thoughtful, kind, funny, generous and I feel horrible for even considering the above. But when it's bad, it is BAD.

10,"I have an appointment coming up and I am absolutely just bleh about going. Long story short, the last person I saw( psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner) basically made it seem like because I'm very aware of my symptoms, that they aren't there. Like...I am not sure how to go about saying everything again to someone new again.  I don't like anyone digging around in my head in the first place and it was hard to admit some things, like acknowledge it out loud. It feels like I'm being punished for being aware of myself and what's going on in my head. Im so lost and idk how to approach this. It's making me panic.",05Apr2017,2

17,"Within the past year or so, I've been having some problems that, when I looked into them, have occasionally popped up as indicative of ADD/ADHD.  I am NOT claiming I have ADHD by any means, and I do not believe I have it, mainly because I have never had such a problem with these before.  They are:

* lack of concentration, specifically in class or doing homework
* Memory problems 
* (not sure of the proper term) Feeling like my brain is slower than those around me
* Frequently ""losing"" a sentence/thought (by this, I mean I will forget what I'm thinking about/occasionally talking about in the middle of a sentence and I have to repeat what words I remember before I get back on track)
* I've recently started interrupting people on accident
* lack of motivation/discipline
* *severe* procrastination
* brain fog, when it comes to homework
* constant fatigue

These symptoms weren't really a problem until I started college.  I'm in counseling, and it's helped my anxiety quite a bit (it's pretty mild now, compared to six months ago), but it just doesn't feel like it's working for anything else.  Am I just lazy and have a horrible self-discipline problem, and if so what tips/advice do you guys have?  Again, *I do not claim to have ADHD or anything mental* except what I've been tested to have, which is moderate (now mild-ish) anxiety and mild depression.  I just want to get my brain working like it was a year+ ago.

Feel free to ask if I have any other issues/symptoms/etc. or any questions you guys may have.

18,"I grew up living with my grandmother mother has been mentally ill all my life. A lot of the time she's fine but every so often her illness comes back and it tends to hit me hard. 

This morning i received a very unusual phone call from her and he wasn't really making any sense. I phoned my gran who told me she has a doctor's appointment tomorrow but my gran always gets annoyed at me for bringing up her mental illness and asking if she's getting help.

My aunt was always good at cheering me up and helping me through the grief but she recently found out she has breast cancer so obviously has her own problems to deal with. I don't like to lay all this on my girlfriend too much either which is why I've decided to post this here.

Could do with some cheering up here guys! If any of you have a mentally ill relative or loved one I'd like some advice on coping because I'm feeling very helpless and alone. Thanks!",05Apr2017,2
19,"Disclaimer: This may be offensive on alot of levels, but hear me out first: 

How come all of the sudden everyone is manically depressed, and posting motivational quotes daily? Is it because of the attention and pity, or what else? I know really depressed people, and they don't cope by posting on facebook for attention, hell, I was severely depressed and in a damn mess for two years untill I got fired at my job and left with 10k of debt, and only then digged my way out of that dump by self controll and meditating, not posting on facebook and letting everyone feel bad about me.",05Apr2017,16
20,"I keep on forgetting certain things. Like, when I'm talking to my family about what we're having for dinner, I'll ask them, then 10 seconds later I think ""Oh! I came out here to ask what/when's dinner"". So I ask them the exact same question, completely forgetting that I asked just 5-10 seconds ago.


Also, I cannot read books. It's (mostly, not always) fine when I'm reading things online, but when I read a book, I completely 100% forget what I had just read. And I absolutely hate that, because there are a few books that I would absolutely LOVE to read as a physical copy. 

Does anybody know anything to 'cure' or 'help' this? Anybody else experience this too? Thank you :)",05Apr2017,29
21,"On paper, I seem to have it under control. I have two jobs, and also own a business. I have a great circle of friends, and a family who loves me dearly. On the outside, it would appear as if I have my ""shit"" together, but in my head.... Oh in my head. I am a fucking loose cannon. My thoughts go from one extreme to the other. Most of these thoughts are self-deprecating or negative. I have no idea what I want out of life, and I continuously beat myself up for not yet having it figured out (I am 28 yrs old). But i take no action towards figuring anything out. Instead, I tend to mope around, overindulge in temporary 'highs', and procrastinate. I use alcohol and cocaine way too much. I smoke a pack of Newports a day. I physically feel like shit and mentally I am exhausted. But i don't seem to muster enough willpower to want to change these self destructive ways. It's like I don't even care to try and make a change. The thing it, I am, just becoming aware of my mental illnesses. I was actually once pretty happy. Thought i wanted everything I currently have now. Turns out, if i could let go of the business, get out of debt, and save up some $$$ then i would let it all go and take off for Thailand or Central America. Let the road take over. Because this current situation is not working. At all. I feel stuck. I know I can do better, hell i even know WHAT to do to make it better. I just don't do it. Because I am tired. Like I am really fucking tired. I am going to see a therapist. I will defeat myself. No matter what it takes. It is my only shot at salvation. Just wanted to share.

23,"Hello, I would like to share with you a matter on which I often think about.
I have been in therapy for several years, during this time I have become much more aware of myself, of how my mind works and how I can lead it to a better state. It would have been impossible without the operation of a therapist, who aside from help me with mental disease has made me become somehow deeper.
My question is: how does an healty mind works? I have enveloped the convinction that awarness means healthiness, fullness and harmony; so how can people who aren't involved in a therapy do this alone? Is it simple to face yourself, your fears and your own thought pattern with a decent level of serotonin or most of them just live in a some kind of glass prision of ignorance? Because when I relate to people I truly can't understand.

26,"Location: USA, Texas, DFW area

I'm going about the process of trying to find a professional to have conversational therapy with. However, every office I call, I seem to always just get voicemails. I work a 9-5-ish office job, and so I'm not available to play phone-tag all day long; I'm used to doctor's offices, where there is administrative staff to field calls and schedule appointments.

Is it just the prevalent case that for mental health professionals, a lot of them are one-person operations? Or do I just have bad luck in always calling the ones that are run this way?

Edit: Thank you all for sharing your experiences! The perspective will definitely help me as I go about trying to get some help.",05Apr2017,5
27,"So to sum it up, ex is in therapy in another state (staying at a nice out-patient facility). There were some legal issues and court sent her to get treatment for her BPD. Technically we aren't supposed to talk right now legally, but she hit me up via text, and I went along with it. I encouraged her to do the treatment, told her I was happy was getting treatment etc, we rekindled things and talked about therapy being the right choice, finally.
She's going to be there for a few more months probably. After talking / rekindling everyday for about a month, long distance; she said her therapist is giving her 3-hour intensive sessions now, and that the therapist asked that we go 'no contact' for two weeks. I said it was ok with me, it's been about a week so far.
Do therapists ask for no contact during therapy sessions? Is there a reason for that? I'm just curious if that's a thing or maybe she's messing with me.",05Apr2017,1

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in but at first glance I thought it was fitting. I have a mind that wanders all over the place. I get carried away with thoughts and emotions very quickly to the point that it impairs my ability to get work done some times. I stumbled across this video that has some helpful tips on how to improve on controlling your own mind. I already practice some of these and have found them helpful. This guy really gives some great perspective and I wanted to share. I'd love to hear your thoughts.

37,"I've been supporting a friend living with depression who is almost constantly in a suicidal state- watching her suffer is really difficult and it's not fair that she has to live with such a low quality of life. Although everyone says it's a temporary state it's been going on for a couple of years now and there seems to be no improvement, every 10 seconds of life exhausts her. It's getting to the point where I feel almost worse encouraging her to keep going and, although it sounds appalling, I keep thinking maybe she should be able to end it- maybe the right to life should come hand in hand with the right to death. I would never openly condone it or even air these thoughts as I know it's a terrible thing to think, I just can't stop thinking it. On the New Year's Day just gone, a distant friend of mine committed suicide and I haven't slept properly since but the only thing keeping me sane is this thought, that maybe it was for the best. It ended the suffering. Is this really awful? How do I stop thinking this?",05Apr2017,7
38,"I have someone that I'm very close to who I believe has had a psychotic break recently. Over the last eight months, this person's behavior has gone from what we thought was regular to paranoid, delusional, withdrawn, and generally concerning. 

Most recently, they called the paramedics because they felt that something was wrong and wanted help. While being assessed, they admitted to wanting to hurt their self and was placed on suicide watch as a result. Since being admitted to the hospital, they have admitted to feeling lost, having trouble separating reality from things in their head,  real guilt about relationships with friends, and not feeling like their normal self. We're now in the process of getting a behavioral health/mental illness assessment complete. 

Does any of this sound ""normal"" or similar to what any of you have experienced? I would like to know what things have helped or currently help you with staying stable, so that I can keep this in mind when I interact with them.

It's also tough that they are having a hard time remembering the last few days and what has all transpired. I've had to remind them that nobody is conspiring against them, but that they sought help and it's still in progress. 

TL;DR: Close friend may be experiencing Psychotic break, not yet confirmed by therapists. Would like to understand coping mechanisms that have helped some of you. Would also like pointers on how to best interact with them.
