0,"Hi,

I'm diagnosed with ADHD and have been on medication for about a year so far. Things are looking better than before but something's on my mind that you guys possibly know more about.

Not sure how to describe but it feels like my period of time in which I am actually able to remember events in and assign emotion is extremely short.

What I mean by that is that I cannot recall feelings / emotion from the past when they're further than a few days in the past.

For example I enjoy spending time with my friends a lot but I still can't actually recall how I felt when I was out with them. On a rational level I understand I was enjoying myself, I can remember all I was doing, everything that's happened but there's in a way no emotion attached to it.

I'll feel like spending more time with them for one or two days later but then it suddenly drops off and the associated feelings evaporate. This also means that I rationally know I have friends but it's very hard to 'feel' or 'understand' that we're actually friends. Just within a 1-2 days I go from being excited and wanting to talk and spend time with them to simply knowing that the person exists and that we're communicating often.

This happens with everything in my life pretty much. If I don't actively do the same activity every single day consecutively, I suddenly stop remembering how I felt about whatever it was and don't pick it back up again until later .

For example I'll remember I haven't talked or met up with a friend in a while. That itself is just like I'm remembering a fact. There's really no emotion attached to it, I don't mind not having seen him for quite a while. Then I remember that I have to make an effort to keep up with friends but have absolutely 0 motivation to go through the effort to agree on meeting up and going through the hassle of getting to wherever we're going etc. What I usually do is I just write a super short message about hanging out on the weekend or during the week and agree on something asap so once it's set in stone I have already commited to plans and can't back out or not do anything. Then I'll actually enjoy my time in the moment and wonder why I don't do this more often.

It's like this with everything in my life. It's extremely hard to keep anything up but it's also really, really easy to stop doing stupid shit. I play games quite a lot (well used to play a lot) and even when I was playing WoW for 10h a day when I missed two days in a row I immediately lost interest and never picked it back up until a few months later. On the other hand side it means that I'm having super much trouble keeping up positive things aswell. I tried to learn a language in the past and enjoy doing so really much, do it every day for an hour but then I miss 1-2 days and suddenly it's become something completely without meaning despite it having been an integral part of my schedule just a few days ago.

I don't really know what's up or wether this is even abnormal but it's just that I don't know how I'm supposed to do things that require effort if I can't remember that I had fun doing them. 

I might just be overthinking this or blowing it out of proportion but it's been on my mind every once in a while so I thought I'd ask for some opinions here.

Thanks",24Sep2017,6
1,"Hi, I've been reading a number of posts by people that are concerned about the cost of therapy/ don't respond to conventional therapy. I am no expert, but I want to spread knowledge on the resources I do know of:

1) Online CBT. There are a number of online CBT apps. Here is a list: http://www.alustforlife.com/mental-health/therapies/cbt/top-5-online-cbt-courses. I have previously used Kokobot (https://itskoko.com/), and I like it a lot. Kokobot does not bill itself as CBT. If you work for a company, you can try and get your employer to subscribe to Big Health (https://www.bighealth.com/), Sigmend (https://www.sigmend.com/) or X2AI (https://x2.ai/). X2AI is currently running free trials for university students (send them a note to find out more). I do not work for these companies, and I have not used any of their products. 

2) I've heard some talk about ketamine being an alternative therapy for those that don't respond to conventional therapy (http://time.com/4876098/new-hope-for-depression/). I am not a medical professional, but this may be a conversation worth having with a medical professional. ",24Sep2017,2

I feel inadequate at work, and constantly feel as if I am disliked by people. I have no evidence to suggest it besides what I perceive from comments, but I am very paranoid about things like that. I frequently think about suicide, a good way to describe it would be to think of it in the sense of it being comforting. At this point I don’t think I would ever do it, but I do think about it very frequently.  I’m extremely lonely. I wouldn’t even know how to begin to know about getting a Gf at this time because I’ve spent so many years JUST having sex with people of the opposite sex.  I have unrealistic standards for a significant other of which I am obviously aware. If I was just a terrible person I feel like I would own it..but the truth is I’m not so sure.

4,"I missed me first two appointments and then was canceled upon twice.

- No excuse for me missing the first two. I'm just bad at keeping appointments. 

- Therapist was apparently attending a training seminar the first appointment I arrived on time to and was out sick the second time.

I'm not sure if I want to schedule another appointment because I feel like I'm being given the run around and I don't want to be disappointed by being canceled upon again. Should I attempt one more appointment or just attend therapy elsewhere? I had a lot of success elsewhere before but I moved over an hour away from that location.

Also, I've only briefly met with my therapist and only KNOW that she is in charge of a women's abuse group but the company she works at keeps scheduling my individual sessions with her. I've realized recently that I probably need trauma counseling and maybe a focus on being successfully adaptive in the present with focus on the future perhaps too.

The other day, I was reading a long serious text when my friend started screaming a question to me. I asked her why she was screaming and she told me she had been repeating her question over 3 times. I felt like I was being rude, and I probably came off as rude but I seriously could not hear anything. It happens frequently and I can't understand why I can't hear anything else when I am focused on something. I'm not sure if I have a disorder, but I want to find the root of my problem.",24Sep2017,1

I feel like a completely different person from who I was before I fell into this pattern, and I can hardly remember the last 5 years. It feels as if a chunk of mental functioning within my mind has simply vanished.

Only thing I can find related to chronic sleep deprivation is that it can supposedly cause ""irreversible brain damage."" If so, well, fuck. I don't know who I can talk to about this. A doctor? A psychiatrist?",24Sep2017,1

It's gotten to the point where if I don't take the Ativan I feel very physically ill, but if I do take it I am lower than low in my mood. Has anyone else had a similar experience or have any insight?

10,"As the title says, I'm returning to university to finish my last couple of semesters after taking a two year hiatus.  I initially left university because of mental health issues (depression, Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder) that significantly impacted my ability to do or even hand in completed assignments (I was obsessed with academic perfection and would literally withhold finished essays because I thought they were imperfect).  Within two semesters, my GPA fell from a 3.7 to a 2.8!  How horrible!  I am now looking at my last year as a time to redeem myself for potential graduate schools. I know I have a long road ahead of myself.  My primary goal is to finish this last year strong. 

During the two year hiatus, I improved my mental health through a combination of therapy and self-care.  I took a couple of courses at community college to gauge my preparedness for university and earned all A's.  My OCPD did not seem to re-emerge although I did feel the need to maintain perfection at times.  

I start school again in 5 days.  This is a large, top 25 ranked international school.  The students are generally competitive but kind.   The professors teach quickly, maintain high standards, and are largely unforgiving; as an example, at the peak of my mental health issues I fell behind in class and the professor sent an email to state that if I did not finish a particular assignment on time she would fail me - despite the fact that I went to her office beforehand and explained the difficulties I was having at the time.  

I feel better now.  I feel prepared and responsible.  I try my best not to victimize  myself.  But, I'm so worried that my mental health will falter.   If I feel myself slipping into sadness or if I feel like my OCPD is re-emerging, what can I do?  What are some therapeutic strategies that have helped you?  

Any suggestions are helpful!  Thanks!

12,"Blah. 

Not sure how I can say what I want to say about the stuff going on in my head tonight, but as usual I'm flailing around in the hopes of finding anything resembling a clue or an answer...clarity. I'm looking for clarity. Or maybe I've already got it and there is something else going on, tricking me and muddying the waters unnecessarily. But what is ""that"" problem then, and how do I free myself from those chains? Dramatic analogy, but hey, it's apt!

So anyway. I went to a local comedy show tonight (as opposed to trekking to a comedy show like also happens).
It was funny, but I was in my head the whole time. Nothing new. But I couldn't stop thinking thoughts like:

I'm so jealous of the comedians because they're doing what they want to do, which is also what I want to do

Life is so short and i barely ever laugh. I just gut it out through each day as best I can, and even though I have learned to enjoy some things, I feel like I'm living pale ghost of the vibrant, exciting, meaningful life I think might be possible.

Why can't I just suck it up and force myself to put together some jokes and just try comedy? why do I procrastinate following such a powerful urge to make people laugh? Why do I make it out to be this huge thing when I easily have the time to write some jokes and try it out?

Why am I so self centered that seeing other people do what they love just fills me with self loathing and jealousy?

Why do I feel like I want to ""do"" comedy so strongly, but am certain that I will fail?

FAAAACKCKCKCKCKCK.

I just need to write some stupid jokes and perform them. I've gotten in front of crowds before. Sure, I'm a nervous embarrassment most of the time but I can probably do the comedy thing, I think...

Why does my mind go blank when it comes time to ""write""? 

I know this post might belong in /r/comedy, but it's also mental health stuff since it brings up so much pain, repetitive self loathing , sadness, etc.

Thanks.

15,"I grew up thinking my mom is ""crazy"", she would inhibit my siblings and me from doing things. These things would range from not being allowed to watch Pokemon simply because it's derived from the word Pocket Monsters. To a conservative white lady with the fear of god in her, this is the work of the devil trying to infiltrate our lives and plant the seed of evil within us. This essentially meant we were excluded from this world wide, cultural phenomenon; not playing gameboy, not having the 'tazo's' you got in packs of chips, not watching it, etc. But this isn't really anything to hold a grudge over, although I'm sure there are quite a few people who would testify to the glory of Pokemon. But the the things that truly inhibited me (and my siblings) - and I struggle to exactly define it - was forcing her perspective of the world on us in a weird way. Obviously children learn from there parents in lots of ways, but this is where it feels weird. If i can put it this way... She would tell us about the world as she feared it, not necessarily as it was. By this i mean if i asked why should i brush my teeth (being a reluctant little kid) she would say something like, ""otherwise the other children won't want to be friends"". It's almost as if the whole world got described to us with a ""fear of my children being hurt"" filter on it. Which I came to understand as I got older, her just being protective over her children. But she could easily say its to keep your teeth from rotting or something like that, but it always came down to something with an element of fear for not being liked. And to her only the ideal is liked. This meant that when we presented an idea or a thought or an emotion to my mom, her response would be that of one that only considered how it will be perceived by the public and the public only accepts an idealized version of something. She would fail to tell us about the actual world in a way. She induced this always self conscious mentality into us, in the sense that our actions and reactions were determined by how it will be perceived. My brother, being a cool, nice guy rebel, would have a philosophy following something like ""People will judge you, so you might as well do what you want as long as it doesn't hurt other people"". This need to be perceived as ideal got turned on its head, resulting in my brother having a strong sense of being true to oneself and not some idea of ideal. My one sister acts in a very idealized way, as my mom would have it in some way. But she's very aware she only does this because of how we got raised. By knowing this she took control of it and didn't allow it to define her, she sort of went with it knowing who she really is. My other sister probably understood this effect my mother had the best. She is well aware of this aspect of the world, how something might be perceived and how it needs to be ideal or perceived as ideal. She also recognizes the source of this tendency, but she also incorporates it into how things are done. She has a strict schedule, good with money, always on time etc. She, just as all my siblings, are people of true substance.
But I feel like I've lost a point of reference.
This fear of not being perceived as ideal inhibited (and still does today) me from being myself. Myself being someone that might not agree with what someone said in a scenario, but fail to speak my mind because I'm afraid of how it might be perceived or that a person won't like me. So much so that I've been called a people pleaser quite often, or a social chameleon. And so i saw myself, not too long ago, as someone who is just a people pleaser. This thing my mom does resulted in me thinking I am this way because i had no true self confidence when I was younger, so might as well use it as a strength and relabel it in my brain as ""the ability to befriend people"". But this resulted in a ""nice guy but don't get me angry"" mentality, where this point of anger is always a hypothetical one. I justified my inactivity on a scenario by saying I was only inactive because the point at which I intervene has not yet been reached, but actually i was just scared to intervene. This made me a nice guy, by-stander. I felt disappointed in myself when someone says something i didn't agree with and i just kept quiet because I'm afraid I'm not portraying the ideal and therefore won't be liked. I couldn't stop seeing my self as someone who is just a nice guy, by-stander who is a people pleaser, and I saw this as a bad thing. I saw it as a bad thing because I knew I was doing it out of fear of not being liked and not wanting to show vulnerability. Over the next 3 years I would torture myself with this idea. Where this basic idea of I don't express myself because I fear not being liked ultimately turned into my believing I am a piece of shit that can not achieve anything. I do a lot of things in my own way, without care of how it will be perceived, but when it comes to social settings and interactions I fail to express myself to the point I sometimes wonder who I truly am. Its as if this one fear is controlling everything. I felt like a major disappointment because I could not get over this fear. Whenever a scenario presented itself, no matter how many pep talks I gave myself, I fail to express myself. This made me incredibly depressed and insecure; Not eating, not sleeping enough, sleeping too much, lost contact with 90% of friends, never wanted to go out, smoking excessively, not studying and failing a year. I felt like a loser in the truest sense of the word. I've come to realize how my mom truly works only in the last couple of months. From thinking this mother of mine is crazy and only imposes stuff based on fear to understanding she did it out of ""care"" even though it wasn't the best way. But what i learned most recently has me questioning a lot of things, but in some way it has liberated me. My mom started speaking of this intense and highly active ""battle"" of some sorts between her and a member of our extended family. Where its mostly psychological warfare; This other person who is spreading lies about her, impersonating her in the attempt defile her name all because this person is jealous. She exposed this new world to me and ever since, I have struggled to make sense of a lot of things I once thought I understood. This world she describes is one where she is the damsel in distress, under constant attack from an ""evil"". This was the ""evil"" she was trying to protect us from, this was why she is who she is. The part that gets me is that we (me and my siblings) have expressed our perceived hurt from her always wanting us to be ideal and her respond gets me. She says us being hurt is a result of this extended family member ruining her name, that this person infiltrated our subconscious by suggesting bad things about my mom to us. And the more we tell her our pain was caused by her not just accepting us, the more she says its because this person used cia-like tactics and much more sneakier ways to infiltrate our minds which results in us having pain/anger towards her. When we ask for evidence, there's a weird story that can confirmed sometimes but mostly she says there's no evidence because that's how they work, in the shadows. Now given this whole awakening to how spies and secret agents worked during WWII and the cold war, people became aware that its still possible today. So this thought of my mom's isn't found in complete fiction, but she has failed to provide evidence of most claims. 

If you've read this far, you'd be happy to know i've arrived at the point. My mother truly believes this, and if its not true, she is delusional. I am then a product of a crazy lady's fear induced method to raising children (how my father would probably describe her). If it is true, then she truly did try to protect us. I am then a product of a misunderstood lady who despite all odds protected us against a real ""evil"". Am I (and my siblings) using my mom as a scape goat for all these pains of mine? If what my mom says is true, I have been in the wrong for years. Thinking what i expressed earlier about how she induces a fearful mentality would be completely unfair of me. If it is not true, she is actually mad. She is then using this other person as a scape goat for our pains as she can not accept the reality we have presented her. This brings me to my final point. My mother believes this as the truth, nothing we say can prove her wrong as. If she believes this, how do I know what anyone believes in is worth believing. How can I tell someone if they're right or wrong? How can someone tell me if I'm right or wrong? Yes science accounts for a lot of the world, but not human consciousness. The state of the reality I'm confronted with seems to elude me, even though I know truth isn't necessarily singular which can result in different iterations of the concept of truth (essentially subjective interpretation). People say we act according to our own moral compass, that we do things we deem ""good"" for some subjective reason. If this compass of mine is based off a lie, how will I ever know how to trust my self and not doubt my own beliefs and sanity?

For example, if I go to the beach on a weekend after a week of class (I'm a freshman in college) I'll be having fun but then I just get this sick feeling in my stomach that I should be doing something more productive or doing work and then I tend to stress myself out. Or if I go shopping to buy something I like I get this feeling of regret afterward even if j really wanted it because I feel like I could have saved that money or something.

18,"I battled depression again and again in my teens and in college. At 24, I finally feel like I can manage my symptoms to a preventive point and am very self-aware. However, despite my slew of majors/minors/college honors post-graduation I work full-time retail and that was the best I could do after a solid year-long job search. Every day I open-endedly ask myself what I did wrong.

A major factor is I'm a military girlfriend and I move around with my SO. I made that choice and I am sticking with it (we plan to marry) but when I originally made it I had NO idea it would do this to my ambitious career plans. Especially since I don't have the more official (the military cares about this, trust me lol) title of ""wife"" I find it harder to continue justifying my current underemployment to myself.

There is hope for promotion to an office position in my actual career field in the company I currently work for, but as I only started a few months ago I've been advised that they need to get to know me as an employee/see my reliability and dedication etc. I agree, but I did retail/customer service throughout high school and college and at least then I had the mental stimulant of homework. I have a genius-level IQ and it's like I can physically feel my brain melting into mush day after day. I spent my life starving for intellectutal stimulation (struggled with insomnia in childhood, etc) and I know pretty much where this is going.

I'm too new to creatively think of ways to be more useful at work and be listened to -- I've even tried consulting the store manager but she's much too busy to also assign me extra projects. Currently I'm bringing a book to work when it's slow (I'm usually cashiering) as I'm working on reviewing my second foreign language. 

This does help, but I also need the philosophical/""life purpose""/career justification for stagnating there telling customers ""thank you come again"" when I poured my blood, sweat and tears into two bachelor's degrees in 4 years to earn a living wage/support myself as an adult + avoid this whole situation I'm now in anyway.

TL; DR: I already monitor clinical depression in remission, but my currently stagnated career is getting to me pretty hard. I need validation that working as I am now will pay off soon but obviously that isn't predictable at all.

19,"I wrote this today in response to a very emotional fight I had with my partner today. I'm overseas at the moment and on my own, so I can't just go see one of my friends... if anyone has advice on emotionally distant partners, feel free to comment.

""Today you broke me down, again. You make me feel hopeless and isolated and no matter how hard I try, I feel as though I can't get through to you, and I try so hard. I feel as though you don't take me seriously and you think I'm being overdramatic and it's so damaging to my mental health. I can't expect you to be everything I need, but this is the one thing I expect in a partner, to be there for me emotionally. I try my hardest to empathise with you, which is why I think you can't be there emotionally for yourself as well. I mean it when I say it hurts, it starts off small, but the constant rejection and lack of support drives me to the point where I have to completely break down before you listen to me. I am not someone who can close myself off emotionally and I need to be able to talk my emotions and feeling through. This is who I am and if you want to be with me you need to accept and work with that. I know it might be difficult for you, to go against a lifetime of emotionally shutting yourself off or backing away from a situation, but that's what it will take if we are going to work. You call me emotional and point out I ""make mounds out of mole holes"". I am human and it is normal to feel and want to express emotions. Before I was with you I never broke down the way I do with you, I know that we both have a role to play in it. You make me feel like I am emotionally unstable, yet before I met you I was confident in my stability and emotional intelligence. I'm afraid it is slowly crumbling away, and with every event where you shut me out and push me to my extreme, I feel as though large chunks of myself are being ripped from my core. I love you so much, which is why I am driven so passionately because I just want you to love and understand me. I want for us to work and continue to grow as a couple. Every time you brush me aside or tell me ""you are busy"", you are making me feel small, rejected and isolated. But most of all, you make me feel like the care and love I have for you is one way. I know I could deal with this better, I need to learn the best responses for both of us in these situations, but sometimes the mental energy it takes to simply get you to comfort me when I'm upset is too much and worsens the situation that I was trying to seek help for. Every time we have a fight, afterwards, I am more determined to repair what was damaged because I am determined in us to work. But I'm honestly feeling defeated and these events are now taking their toll. Since the last fight we had, I have not been able to shake off the shame, emotional instability, isolation and rejection you made me feel from how you treated me. I have rushes of anger at you, and then sadness. I sometimes lay in bed at night contemplating the hopelessness I feel over this issue. I've realised that I can't ""fix you"" and I can't teach you without your help. Honestly, I don't think you are aware of what you are doing and the very severe tolls they are playing on my emotional health. Emotional intelligence is something I think you are lacking, which is strange because it seems like you are so good at it on the outside. If this doesn't change I'm afraid that there will be damaged beyond repair. I don't want to sound dramatic, but I'm now developing anxiety over you not ""taking me seriously"" and that I am the one who is emotionally unstable. For my own health I can't do this forever, I know that this will be the thing that breaks us if it continues. I'm already feeling as though I can't go through it again after today. I hope for your sake that you can change, for the sake of us, but also for the sake of your future relationships. I couldn't imagine this being healthy for a child because I fear that is where it starts for most people. A vicious cycle that continues to be passed down generation to generation without ever being corrected. If we don't make it, I hope you can change so you don't push all your future partners away from you… because you are so special and so wonderful in every other aspect of your life, it's just this one thing. I guess no one is perfect. I don't think you will ever read this, but this is for my own mental health, I need to write this down as a reminder.

First I thought she was being mysterious and trying to confuse me and this was making me angry at her for almost no reason at all. When I realized I was the problem I started trying to convince myself it will all work out. And even tho it always does, I am always still terrified almost everyday. It's torture really.

I've been dealing with some things and don't really understand what might be going on with me. I won't write a long statement, I'll just list of things that have been a negative impact of my life.

-Always afraid that someone out there is out to ruin my life
-Waking up in the midst of a panic attack (tightness in chest, heavy breathing, shaking)
-Trouble falling asleep

-Easily irritated
-Unable to get piece of mind

The problem is, I can't really control it, like it's in my veins, like I'm terrified of conflict, and I make my life miserable for little, insignificant things, that snowball into actual big problems. Let me give you an example: I'm getting the money for rent from a fund that's available for me because I've been living with foster parents for almost 10 years, started living in this place last year July. The contract was for a year, after that I've simply signed the one for the next year, and just ""hoped"" they would now and send the money for next month. They have, and I thought everything's okay now. As it turns out, it was the month that was still missing from the start (that I had to borrow from friends), and I have to again reapply for the whole thing, and that takes a while. I felt like an idiot (because I am) and terrified because I might become homeless. But no, helpful people all around, can give in the papers on aug 23rd, and pay at the end of september. Also found a place nearby where I'd have to wash dishes for pretty decent pay, so I could also take care of the debt that was threatening to overflow and then I'd have to pay the whole thing in full, which I can't, I just don't have the money and even If they take everything I have, it won't be enough. Also also, I was at the point where I almost had help with my mental issues, phoned in after the interview, got the spot, they say they need a blood test. uh-oh, i owe money to healthcare n shit, is this gonna be the same, trying to get the whole thing in full? and the shit-for-brains in my head failed to realize that I could just go to a private clinic and do a blood test there. So I've just shut down, not getting a blood test, not going to the place to work , not solving the rent problem. Yes, I know, I realize, I understand how absolutely fucking retarded it is, and I shouldn't be allowed to reproduce, and I agree. Now what? I've alienated all my friends (it was hard, they were (and somewhere deep I hope they still ARE) amazing friends, probably the only thing I've ever gotten right. Right now the only way I feel like I can reach out is my mom, but she can't mitigate the fallout this time, I had to move out for a reason. Now here I am, the only food I've had for the last week were a few 3w old pizza crusts and a 5y old bonbon from my ex, I can't think straight, some ppl might knock on my door to take everything away, or maybe I won't be able to muster up the strength to do something about the rent tomorrow and become homeless in a week, or maybe ... everything will be alright. I don't know. I just can't really live with myself anymore. That doesn't mean I'm gonna kill myself, it's obviously in my mind all the time, but it's more like I can't live like THIS, and I don't think I know any other way to live. And I don't remember a time when everything was ""okay"" , so I don't have a point of reference. Maybe everything that's in my head is normal, and my mind is just too weak to deal with it. I just hope my mind's gonna break, and the explosion won't be too violent to take everything away.

All this is nothing but a smudge, but if you read this: for what it's worth, thank you.",24Sep2017,1

29,"I've had issues literally my entire life. I was diagnosed with OCD at like 7 years old, and first attempted suicide at around 11.

I feel like a horrible, chaotic, dirty person. Not only am I horribly unstable and prone to dramatic outbursts, but I'm also a huge asshole.

I was one of those kids who hurt small animals, lied a lot, and was always freaking out. In high school and middle school, I started lying even more and would constantly be dating multiple people (up to six) at a time. Oh yeah, and I lied about being able to see dead people and threatened to kill my friends.

I'm 20 now, and I'm still exactly the same. A few months ago, I had something of a mental breakdown in which I thought I was a literal vampire and proceeded to drink copious amounts of my own blood and then screamed that the sunlight would burn me to death. I stayed in my bedroom with the windows blocked and refused to leave for like two months.

I feel like my brain itself is just wired all fucking wrong. Like, the way I think is just completely fucked up and broken. I don't know. It just sucks that I have to be this person and I don't think any amount of medication or therapy can really fix me.

Since you somewhat know me now, know this too: I have a medical condition, It's not life and death but still. And it scares me. I just want to talk to someone about it and cry but I can't find anyone. I am blessed with a very supportive parents thats why I feel like I should not burden them any more with my problems. I have a little brother I know he loves me but he is way too much like me. I know he would freeze with not knowing what to do, because I would too. I really don't have any close friends. Most of my friends are from work some of them are my old high school buddies. Non of which are close to me. Or maybe they are close to me but I am not close to them I don't know. Does that make any sense? I also have a SO which I hang from time to time but its nothing special and when it comes to problems she just starts to talk about her own.

I know there are so many people out there without a family without even a person to speak to and that make me feel ashamed of coming here and talk about this. I try to live a stoic life. I acknowledge that talking to someone will not change anything other than saddening them but I still want to. Am I being selfish?

34,"I am a recent college graduate. I live at home. I have recently found myself pushing away everyone I once loved and cared for; I have blocked all my friends numbers, I have stepped away from family, I have no form of social media where anyone I know can find me. I have completely isolated myself. I thought it would be a form of self-help, because many of my relationships were very toxic, but I was very wrong.

I cannot find a job. My father has shifted his love from me to his new girlfriend, who I am very convinced is only with him for his money. I think he stays with her because he is lonely despite all her similarities to my biological mother who he is no longer with. I am no longer a part of any trips, any outings, any decisions- and now I am being made to feel guilty for being unemployed. I’m not allowed to have fun or have a life until I have a job- a successful job. He never went to college so I don’t expect him to fully understand, but the pressure is driving me insane. 

My long distance relationship is barely holding on. He doesn’t want to ever get married or live together, just to continue what we have. This has gone on for 6 years. 

I have had an eating disorder for years now. I dropped 80 pounds in less than a year, then put it all back on in two. 

I have become very minimalist to the point of obsession. When I feel out of control I must purge things. When the house gets messier and messier I must make up for the fact by over cleaning my own spaces. I have no control over any aspect of the home. I stay in bed all day because I can’t accept this lack of control and lack of orderliness. 

Today I finally had the mother of all breakdowns.  I cried so hard my face swelled. I took three showers, I hyperventilated in the shower, I couldn’t stop repeating to myself “I can’t” for at least ten minutes, I scratched my face so hard it bled (I’ve done this before), I felt like i was in a trance for some time, just staring, before returning to bed. 

I don’t feel I have a future. For a long time I’ve convinced myself now I will die young from some unknown cause. But I do not see myself living past another ten years.  I’m 23.

What is wrong with me? I know I’m doing so many things wrong. But I can’t think of what to do right. I have no more motivation. I feel I have already failed so miserably at life I don’t deserve anything further.

36,"So a couple of months ago i started hallucinating, hearing voices, and self harming. I always had some of the common features (Severe fear of abandonment, self worth, extremes in emotion, being convinced mental health docs where conspiring to let me die, convinced i was too damaged/unworthy for love ect), but hid it as best i could to protect someone. This built (with the help of some personal issues, Uni, relationships ect) to a fair few emergency A&amp;E trips and so on. eventually after chasing the NHS services for a while and seeing 2 private pychs, I received a diagnosis of BPD (which apparently can come commonly with psychotic symptoms?). Ive got to i was more than shocked. Got a second opinion, same story. So now im starting to see that it actually makes some sense. Problem is I knew someone closely that had severe BPD and their experience was pretty (at least visibly) different to mine, and no doc's told me it can exhibit differently, which is making me wonder if its accurate?(TBF i never asked).

45,"Throwaway account because duh.

So, I'll try to explain this as clearly as possible. I'm a 22-year-old male. I am currently a student in university, but I haven't been a good student. I started in 2013, fell behind almost instantly in the first year, and never really recovered. I fell into a dark place, started having drinking issues, and was really unhappy, which, in turn, put me further behind in school. Everything was looking pretty bad until 2015 when I managed to get a date (and then started dating) a friend from high school. This was my first relationship, and my first time having sex was with her. 

Everything was going well. I was genuinely happy, the relationship was going well, my grades were starting to get better. I moved in with my girlfriend after just over a year of dating (her parents' idea, actually). That is, until this summer. My GPA was still too low despite my improvements and, because of my being on academic warning, I was suspended from my program for 1 year. In the year where the friends I made in first year were graduating, I was knocked back down to basically first-year status, because if I get put on suspension, I have to repeat any classes I got less than a C- in (which was most of them). Of course, I told my girlfriend about this and she didn't take it well. Three days later, she told me she wanted to take a break and I should move out and go back to my parents. 

It's now been almost 4 months. She's seeing someone new and has told me she's very happy. Meanwhile, I'm completely miserable. I still miss her every day and the thought of her with someone else makes me sick to my stomach. I managed to get hired as a temporary full-time worker at the summer job that I've been working the last 4 years, which should make me very happy, but I get up in the morning and don't want to get out of bed. Even my other job, refereeing, that I've wanted to do since I was a kid, doesn't make me as happy as it used to. 

I'm starting to feel more and more like I used to before I met my girlfriend every day. I've been drinking more, seeing couples out in public just infuriates me for no reason, and the teeniest of things just sets me off into a rage. 

So I guess my question is, should I be looking for a therapist and seek professional help, or is this just me having trouble getting over the girl I still love? ",24Sep2017,1

50,"But really I'm not near as agitated as I would have been with this same set of circumstances which is a major victory...but. Damn those ""buts""...the demons are so loud and so old that even major victories are just kinda ""meh"" since I really want TOTAL freedom from them.

Started with a good night last night (date, great comedy show). Wracked with insecurity throughout the night, couldn't wait to get home. 

The sad voice within that wants to write and be funny was wishing I would quit procrastinating and just write jokes, perform, do something, anything, just DO, instead of think. 

I've been doing a lot, but it's all mundane. It's powerful because I decided to start DOING instead of letting myself stagnate any further, and even though the DOING has taught me great lessons and has, and will continue to have, very pragmatic benefits in my life (health, financial freedom, learning discipline, social skills, confidence) I now realize that I want more. 
Big surprise eh?!

Despite my best efforts to remain numb I think I'm pretty much desensitized, which means that pain is so much more intense than it's ever been. It's unbearabale. It's the kind of pain that creates either diamonds or dust. It's exciting, but it's not a movie montage, which means that the pain continues to be pain, and I have to keep going through it. But it's liberating.

Last night I forced myself to spend some time trying to be funny. Sounds weird, and I won't go in to detail, but I wrote some stuff and did some other stuff online. Nothing illegal. 

Couldn't sleep all night due to my room mates stupid cat meowing and meowing and meowing all freeeeeaking night. 
I yelled at the top of my lungs to get them to put it outside, no luck, so I took matters in to my own hands. Felt bad, but also got to enjoy a bit of quiet before going to work.

Went to work, and that's where the victories happened.

Worked with bitchy coworkers and enough rude or awkward customers to trigger the old me in to some pretty devastating stuff.

But I'm forcing myself to remember the pain, to not let anyone add more pain to my sum total. I'm not giving my power away. I still fear I will, and who knows, it might happen, but I'm on a good path in that I'm too angry and wounded to let anyone else give me their poison any longer. I've taken WAY too much abuse. Sure, much of it was probably in my head, which is a problem in itself, but doing the CSI thing on each bad feeling is exhausting and unproductive, so I'm really using my feelings instead of just my head.

It's great. But make not mistake, I'm still very on edge. Still worried I will freak out at work and throw something at someone or get in someones faces when they come at me with some petty nonsense. But I'm reeeeeally striving here, striving to be the best I can and to not let any petty bullshit take me down. I feel like I've tapped in to my ""higher self"" and to let myself get bogged down in silly ego games would be one of the most wasteful thing I could do, now that I have found some self respect.

My emotions were still threatening to do the roller coaster thing. you know: Good thought, wow this feels good, I FEEL REALLY GOOD AND EVERYTHIGN WILL BE AMAZING (manic phase), burnout...that's a very linear description. I don't know how to describe the unstable emotions and bizarre thoughts that feel so volatile. They flare up when I'm tired, over caffeinated, over stressed.

I'm clawing my way to something better. I'm still so scared, so full of doubt and despair, so confused, so impatient, but hey, I'm not reeling from the pain of dealing with people today, and that feels good.

Plus lots of people were so nice to me today, which is something to be grateful for.

Hi guys I'm a 18 year old lad at college at the moment and I've never had a girlfriend not to say I've never had short flings and done stuff with girls but recently I've realised I havent even been ""talking"" to a girl or even tried to ""graft"" a girl so to speak since i was 16 and really don't have a major want to.Just to clarify I'm 100% straight but ATM I've been really focused on myself such as career related stuff and getting grades etc and just havent even considered girls really but it doesn't bother me at all it only crops up in my brains because I think I should be really bothered about it it's almost social concept to have a girlfriend or at least try at my age.Im not even a loner I get invited to parties regularly and get a fair whack of female attention and compliments but I just never seem to be bothered about getting it to go anywhere.one thing I do notice about myself which may be relevant is that unlike a lot of my friends even if a girl is a 10 if she has the personality of a flip flop and little intelligence I'm never interested even on a drunk night out yet my friends are never bothered by this,I think this may stem from the fact I always analyse people in a lot of depth everything they say, wear, do ,act etc.maybe I am attracted to a niche as I do really like confident,well spoken fairly intelligent girls with ambitions and maybe they are few and far between at my age but yeh overall at the moment I really don't care about girls enough to even want to message any or try and graft at parties but I don't know why ,do I have some mental problem or low sex drive ????

52,"Cross post from r/relationships:

I hate my husband so much right now. Sometimes it's worse than others and sometimes I feel like I love him. I need some outside perspective. 

My husband and I met through work in 2013. On our first date in his very messy vehicle, he stank (not just his car), but we otherwise had a great time. We slept together on our third date. I never saw his apartment and he was clearly nervous about showing me. A couple of months later I got kicked out of my very religious family's house for ""sleeping with someone I'm not married to"". I ended up moving in with him WAY TOO SOON.

His basement apartment was extremely unsanitary. He had lived in that apartment for about six years and it was filled to the brim with old stuff he'd been basically hoarding. I recognized the smell from his apartment as what he smelled like on our first date. There was mold in the walls from flooding every time there was heavy rainfall. I found out later that most of the food in the fridge/freezer was extremely expired and some of the boxes on the floor contained perishable food. His apartment had ants, cockroaches, and centipedes, and he had bagged clothes in the corner from a former bedbug battle.

For some reason I decided to stay and take him and his apartment on as a project (I know, stupid me). I made a lot of headway, then would get discouraged and give up completely for awhile. I would clean the entire kitchen, including purging his fridge/freezer, and buy groceries. He would cook something elaborate, then leave the food out on the stove and all his ingredients out on the counter. I didn't wash the dishes. I was raised to clean dishes as I cook and put the ingredients away right after I used them, so my kitchen is pretty much clean after I'm done cooking. His style totally overwhelmed me and I never cleaned up after him. As a result, the kitchen would remain dirty for several days, with food molding over, until I (never he) got the nerve to glove up, clean up, and purge the fridge again. We ended up eating fast food almost every meal of every day. 

Additionally, he hardly ever showered or brushed his teeth. He wanted me to kiss him with his slimy teeth/ tongue and give him BJs with his unwashed johnson that smelled like a baby's wet diaper. He left the bathroom door open during his horrendous IBS movements and rarely if ever washed his hands because he ""didn't get anything on them"". He had a massive fungus growth on the back of his head that he never treated. He scratched at it at night and it bleeds onto his pillow. His athlete's foot was so bad that his nails were gnarled, thick, and yellow. His breath was so bad at night that when I walked into the bedroom while he was sleeping, the smell slapped me in the face. He picked his nose in front of me. He lied to me about his age until several months in (he's late 30's, I'm late 20's). He also didn't want to meet my family (said he was nervous) and didn't want me to meet his (I met them on accident a year after we'd moved into together). He was late to work so many times that I'm surprised he's kept his job. 

I definitely regret staying. I should have walked out after the first date. Who comes to a first date stinking? It usually only gets worse after the first impression. But I think I was so desperate to love someone and be loved. I grew up in a physically and emotionally abusive household in a religious cult with a mother with untreated psychosis. I had six stepdads during my childhood and moved in the middle of almost every school year until high school (when we joined the cult). I had a history of depression and suicide attempts prior to moving away from my family/ex-cult on the West Coast, and living on the East Coast was a new start at life for me. 

My self esteem was very low and on top of that, I seemed to jump from crisis to crisis. I developed serious asthma as soon as I moved into his apartment (for obvious reasons) that disappeared almost completely when we moved. Then I lost my birth control in his hoarder apartment and got pregnant (Yes, I know we shouldn't have had sex without birth control, but we were already talking about marriage and I had a medical condition where I wasn't supposed to be fertile). After I returned to work after pregnancy, I had multiple back injuries that kept me from working for a few months. He was very supportive through all of the chaos. He continued to work so that I could stay home intermittently, first to go to school, then with the baby, then with my back injury.

He was nervous about getting married. He had been burned before by ex-girlfriends. They all cheated on him and he had major trust issues as a result. When he found out I was pregnant, we immediately got married and started house hunting. He didn't want me exposed to that unsanitary environment during pregnancy. We moved to the new house, taking very few belongings with us to avoid bringing bugs, and started off fresh. I thought I was happy. 

Now our son is 1 1/2 and we've been married for 2 years. Almost nothing has changed. The longer I'm with him, the more I wish I'd stayed single. I love watching him interact with our son. He is such a great dad, and the primary reason I haven't left is because I don't want my son to have the unstable life I had. The other reason I haven't left is because I don't have my own car or money.

The house is for sale. My husband and I have job offers from the same company in another state and he really wants to move away. I'm used to moving and can live wherever he's happy. My son is too little to care. The reason I don't have a car is because we sold it when we had an offer on our house, then the offer fell through. When I was finally able to return to work after my back injury, we had decided to move, so I didn't apply anywhere.

I know he's not the only problem here. I've got mental health issues, like I stated before. My depression is much better since I moved away from my mom and former church. I have anxiety. I have a short fuse and he hardly ever gets mad at me. I feel like I constantly have to nag him to do things like brush his teeth before we go somewhere, because when I never ask him about it, he rarely does it. I know I treat him like an idiot sometimes, and sometimes I get mad at him for doing exactly what I would have done in his shoes, which I know is irrational. I don't trust him at hardly anything, because he consistently forgets to do things like brush his teeth.

I also have blossomed from minor germophobe (at worst, freaking out if someone sneezes on me) to probable OCD, mostly around my husband. I don't like to kiss him now, even when he's brushed his teeth. I can't stand hearing him fart, even though he usually goes in the other room now. I get grossed out when he wants a BJ or when he puts his finger in my mouth during sex (due to handwashing &amp; nosepicking issues). I hate when he sleeps on my pillow because he never treated his head fungus. I get nervous eating food he's prepared because his hand and food hygiene are so poor, but I rarely cook elaborate things myself. I obviously can do a lot more to clean up after him, like when he makes those big meals that use every dish and ingredient in the house, but I get so overwhelmed and discouraged. I used to be a much cleaner person, but now I've sunk down nearly to his level - I hardly ever clean and I shower about once a week.

He loves me so much, or so he tells me. When we sit down and talk about things to improve, he always says he'll do better and cries at the thought of my unhappiness, which makes me feel like I'm over-reacting and emotionally abusing him (Am I? I don't have any healthy relationships to model after). When I ask him what I need to improve on, he says my temper and lack of patience (agreed), but nothing else. 

Is it even possible to make this better? Is it even possible to leave? I have a toddler, a dog, a puppy, no car, and no job (although I have a local offer and one in another state). If I did leave, would he get custody of my son due to my mental health history and lack of stable employment? I don't want to lose my son. And if I did somehow keep my son, who would watch him while I worked? Is it possible to raise an emotionally stable child as a single mother?

What am I missing here? Does anyone think I'm emotionally abusive? I'm paranoid that I'm treating him like my mom treats my dad.  I'm wondering if I actually have OCD or if I'm just reacting to my husband. On the other hand, am I the only one who thinks he might be mentally ill too?

I feel like his love for me, plus my son's stability, is worth fighting for, but I feel like I'm losing my mental health in the meantime.

Please help me, Reddit.

TL;DR: I feel stuck after I married a man that grosses me out, then had his child and bought a house and two dogs. I feel like I can't leave because of my son plus lack of a job or car.

Edit to add: Our house situation is a lot cleaner now since our house is for sale. I do a thorough cleaning before each showing, but that doesn't mean it's going to stay that way after we move. Also, we're planning on moving to another state soon, and I'm not sure if I want to move there anyway, since the cost of living is way lower and I have a job waiting, or if I should stay, since the relationship is unstable and everyone I know lives here. I'm scared I'll end up leaving him and have no support system.",24Sep2017,2

57,I don't understand what's going on. It's my own fault. I'm doing it to myself. I don't want to die. I just want to injure myself. ,24Sep2017,3
58,"I'm always sad or stressed, I get stressed by the most simplistic of problems and my brain acts on it only in effect if making it worse sometimes until I panic. When I'm sad I'm distant from people and dont wanna leave my room. I play video games as an excuse to kill time but the game I play I'm never good at and I just torture myself. I have a very little amount of self esteem and I usually end up just up billing my self and calling myself terrible times... I dont have a lot of friends that like to talk or reach out to me so I feel alone. The only person I really talk to a lot is my girlfriend, she helps me so much. I've gone to help before but I feel uncomfortable, I dont like unveiling my personal stuff to a stranger in my mind. I'm just wondering if this is just me or if this is similar to a disorder or something like that so I can later talk to.my.doctor about maybe a way to help... I just wanna be happy again and I don't know how to. I'm a very social person but it conflicts with me desire to hide away. I just want people to enjoy my company without me feeling annoying. I always feel like a bother even if they invite me in I feel like I'm just annoying them.",24Sep2017,2
