0,"Over the last few months, I’ve had a few people ask me about what sort of childhood trauma I’ve experienced. The first person was a coworker whom I didn’t (and still don’t) know terribly well but I met during a tumultuous time (I had just ended a 16 year relationship). I no longer work with this guy, but we’ve remained social media friendly. We were only coworkers for a couple months. 

The second person to ask me was another coworker who im really, really close to - but have only known him for about a year. 

The third person is someone I’ve been very good friends with for 25 years. He told me this am that up until very recently, he felt like I was always closed off. He said he’d always felt like there must’ve been some trauma or traumatic event when I was little that contributed to that. 

My therapist (who is very new to me) said there’s something in how I cope with stress that mirrors how alcoholics often cope with childhood trauma.

Here’s the thing: I have no idea what might’ve happened to me. I had a stable, happy, healthy childhood. I have no recollection or even a HINT of a recollection of anything even remotely traumatic. 

I understand repressed memories, but I feel like if there was something so visible on the surface that I might have an inkling of SOMETHING happening - even if I don’t know what. 

Anyone have experience with stuff like this?",25Dec2017,2
1,"I don't know what to believe. I see a lot of people here hype up seeing a psychiatrist and getting antidepressants, but my therapist doesn't really suggest it and would prefer we continue with therapy first. 

She said it's ultimately my choice, but her opinion is that therapy should come first or something along those lines. I'm biased in that I've been on antidepressants before and had a few psychiatrists a few years ago and I felt like it didn't help and had bad side effects. So I want to agree with my therapist, but then I see people post here and a lot of replies are always suggesting seeing a psychiatrist. 

Are medications really that effective? Why didn't it work for me? Why is it always the go-to response? Aren't antidepressants over prescribed and as effective as a placebo? 

I guess I secretly want someone to convince me to try meds again because I'm tired of being suicidal all the time and hoping it will help. But I don't want to feel like I'm crossing my therapist and my own experiences/ thoughts on the matter.",25Dec2017,5
2,If anyone can talk to me please. I'm begging for a miracle I just don't know what to do,25Dec2017,4
3,"So I typically see each of these people once per month, though I would like to see my therapist more frequently. I never really know what to say during these visits. Like what sorts of things should I be relaying to each of these to best get treated? psychiatry is mainly medication based, so just talk about any positive/negative effects of meds and thats it? when I go to my therapist, that is more difficult. the sessions are so short and I only get one per month, so I feel like I always go off on tangents because there's so much for me to talk about, idk. what am I even supposed to talk about to those people? current symptoms? my current stress factors? past events which caused you trauma? how do you guys get the best out of your mental health clinic visits? sorry for ranting here, just trying to become more organized and properly utilize my doctors!",25Dec2017,1
4,I'm aware most men will get in a fight if they feel disrespected. I am not the same I feel a genuine hatred towards people who are rude to me. I can't take it my head explodeds and I develop a dark imagination. I feel like really hurting them not just punching them but putting them through living hell I have felt the same since I was a child being bullied in school. If you hurt me I want you to feel it physically 10× over. I try to stay clear of violence and im good at that. But inside my brain I feel like a true monster with depraved ideas and a moral code that horrifies me. ,25Dec2017,2
5,"She spoke out in earnest but no seemed to hear her.  Surely her stinging insults were harsh but none of the officers seemed visibly agitated by them earlier.  “What a depraved institution,” she thought to herself.  

The pacing began.  The cell was nine feet by nine feet exactly, she measured.  She had been in only one other jail cell before, in Tokyo, where although the laws were strict they treated American prisoners well, responding often to requests and outfitting them with decorative uniforms. Here, protected by American jurisprudence she was certain she would be released just shortly after the paperwork was finally completed.

“She’s not leaving until Wednesday!”  Officer Danisha exclaimed.  She had been sitting on a table outside of the jail room directly in the center where Nancy paced back and forth.  Her robust stomach lay fittingly on top of a grey belt, which was handsomely worn on top of a more drab dark blue uniform.  She joked with her colleagues who spoke at fluctuating pitches, some of which were completely inaudible. 

Nancy looked up in disbelief.  Her thoughts remained internal and she ensured herself that she didn’t utter a word.  It had been only twenty-four hours since the court told her she’d be released within just a few hours.  It was only a small oversight —a shortage of workers that were required to complete the paperwork for her dismissal.  At least, that was what she reminded herself to balance the swelling feeling of anxiety emanating from her stomach that sought to slowly dilapidate the more reasonable thoughts emerging from her mind regarding her rights she learned in school.

“Please look up, is that you?”  Officer Danisha had crept up to the cell while Nancy’s consciousness had been encapsulated within a deep ponder.  The officer was holding an iPad with a picture of Nancy in which her eyes were closed.  It appeared to be a mug shot taken at exactly the wrong moment.

“Yes, can you tell me when I will be released?”   Nancy almost shuttered.  She was relieved to finally get someone’s attention while feeling the need to hide the steadily increasing trepidation she had pitting in her stomach.  Part of her did not want to give the officer the chance to respond negatively, which would spur her thoughts into a frenzy.  Most likely, she thought, they became overwhelmed with there more pressing assignments and forgot that she was one of the prisoners that had been released yesterday.

“You have to see the psychiatrist first.  You refused to see her yesterday.”  Officer Danisha started to walk away. 

“The judge released me!  Of what significance is a psychiatrist when the judge mentioned nothing of the sort?”  Nancy barked hysterically.  

Danisha turned back, her eyes becoming piercingly black.  “When you are ready to go someone will come and get you.”

Nancy answered “Okay.”  Any assuaging words worked to mitigate Nancy’s anxiety.  She knew that seeing a psychiatrist before being released was a ridiculous requirement and any qualified person would recognize that.  Someone would come for her.  

She turned back to have a quick glance of the room.  It was abominable.  There was one toilet with no seat cover in the corner.  No toilet paper was provided.  There was a sink with no running water, and a bed made completely of plastic and no mattress, hardly satisfactory even by American standards. She crawled on the bed and covered herself with a short, soiled, quilted blanket that had been provided to her a few hours ago.  She hadn’t requested it and thought it was random to give a prisoner who had been released a blanket for sleeping.

Nancy closed here eyes and thought back to the day before.  The judge had ordered her to pay a $1,000.00 fine for trespassing at a movie theater.  

One day back in early August, about five minutes into the film a security officer had walked inside the theater.  She eyeballed her mysteriously and approached her, weaving through the rows and seats to advance closer.  

“Are you just watching a film?”  “Is she just watching a film?”  She repeated immediately into the two-way radio before Nancy could answer.

Nancy looked up in bewilderment and searched for a reply.  Her shock combined with the inappropriateness of the questioning left her speechless.  The movie was a thriller and was about midway finished a scene where the plot thickened.  Nancy turned her head to the screen and again to the security officer who murmured several iterations into the radio.  It was a dreadfully awkward silence between the two, and the only other persons in the movie theater chose not to witness what was about to transpire.  

“I’m going to have to ask you to come with me.”  The officer glanced at the door where she had summoned another officer to join.  

Nancy felt a little bit of pressure.  Apprehensively, she placed down the popcorn and walked out of theater behind the officer who seemed overly duty-bound by factors that remained completely unknown to Nancy.

Outside the theater, the officer held open a heavy door which read “Exit Only.”  “Follow me,” she declared.

Nancy walked down a concrete light green hallway, with cement floors to a back office where another officer awaited, printing papers and filling out paperwork.  He was a tall brisk man with stocky fingers and moved around with an air of resilience.  

“To what do we do the honor?”  He stated, with a fixed glance on the woman officer who had brought Nancy there.

The other officer who accompanied the woman looked around hesitantly as if he did not expect the officer to ask such a stark question.  He was short, and looked left to right as if unsure of his dignity in the uniform.

“She was throwing popcorn around and had food all over the floor, we had several complaints.”  The woman officer answered.

Nancy shifted the weight of her legs that had been crossed.  She was baffled, as there had been popcorn that fell to the floor earlier that afternoon as the movie begun but that was sheerly an accident.  She was herself curious as to how the officers would have learned much less been bothered by a such sheer incident that she continued to listen silently.

The three officers shared some information and spoke mostly jargon.

Within five minutes the third officer who Nancy learned they called Danny, asked, “where do you live?”

Nancy told them that she lived only several miles from there.  

“Do you live with your mother?”  Asked the woman officer.  

“No, I live by myself.”

It was a strange question to ask a thirty year-old.  The time had ticked by, an hour passing where the two obdurate officers shelved around to complete an interview demanded by Danny for the arrest.

“You may go, but you may not come back here, or else it will be considered trespassing.”

Nancy opened her eyes with a gasp. She had slept another night away in jail.  She looked up to find Danisha only to realize the officers had changed shifts.  No one had come for her to get released.  

It was early morning.  The view was fettered by the fortifying bars across the window, so that only a humbled soul could find beauty in the pink sky that signaled a new day.  

“She’s looking out the window, get breakfast!”  An officer screeched.  

Nancy stood up and walked to the door of the cell.  She looked around at the room where the security had been sitting.  At the far corner she noticed a doctor with a lab coat.  He peered up at her quickly and looked away.  

Nancy trampled over to the plastic makeshift bed and stepped on top of it.  She began jumping up and down, her head only meters away from hitting the ceiling.  It had been two days since she was promised to be released and her angst nearly brought her to a cold sweat.

“Get down from there or we won’t serve you any breakfast!”  Tana screamed with such bolstering authority that it rocked Nancy off coordination and she fell off the bed and to the floor.   Tana was a skinny woman with curly brown hair.  She had a very deep voice and an accent from some Caribbean island.

“You cannot refuse me breakfast and why am I still in here?” Nancy bawled.  She was only half expecting a response.  The staff had been so inexplicably insensitive that Nancy was almost expecting someone in no less than a superhero’s suit to come and open the cell.

“We can’t reach anyone to pick you up and you must see a doctor.”  Tana picked up the iPad and scanned the door.  “Is this you?”  

Nancy clammed up.  Since when did someone have to pick someone up from a jail after being released?  Why are they forcing a doctor on her?

“Just think of this as a hospital and you’ll be fine.”   Tana said.  

“I want a lawyer.  Why do I have to think of this as a hospital?”  Nancy demanded an answer and placed her hands on her hips.  She felt that her only reconciliation with Tana’s authoritativeness would be to invoke every facet of the law of which she had knowledge.  However, to her dismay, Tana grimaced and walked away.

Within minutes, the latch opened and Nancy was served a foam tray of grits, an orange and sausage.  She took the tray and decided to eat this time around.  As she swallowed a bite of the detestably prepared food, she felt a wave of cognizance leave with her every bite, as her thoughts and concerns drifted into a space where there was no blameworthiness — a reality where her rationality drifted into frailty.  “I literally am dependent on a doctor although I was released days ago,” she thought to herself.

As if on queue, the doctor appeared in front of her.  “I am your doctor this morning, Nancy.  How are you feeling?”

“I am feeling like I should not be in jail after I was ordered to leave.” Nancy replied in despair.

“Well, I need you to stay here, can you help me by doing that?  Do you have any known medical history of mental illness?”

Nancy was stunned.  “No, and I don’t need anyone to escort me out of the jail.  The judge said I had to pay $1,000.00 and that I have no sentence!”


“You don’t have to pay $1,000.00.  I will prescribe you some medication.  You should have court within a couple of days.  They will come get you.”  The doctor walked away.

Nancy slumped down and sat on the bed leaving the food on the latch for the officers to collect. “What place is this that I have to go to court twice?  That I must stay in jail for days? Where I have no lawyer?”  She thought to herself.

After seven days, Nancy finally broke down and took the medicine.  She was released four days after going to court for a second time.",25Dec2017,2
6,So I really want all the negative people out of my life and still have one person causing issues. He's a friend of a friend who slowly working his way into my social group so much so I find my other friends quot his jokes. He is an insufferable Human being.

12,"Hi all,

I am just looking for some general opinions and feedback.  Anything offered it appreciated

My brother is almost 35 years old. He is an elementary school teacher.  He is decently successful in his career. 

He still lives with our parents. Our mom does everything for him because if she doesn't, he won't do it. Like laundry and making food.  He refuses to try to learn to do this basic tasks on his own. Instead of improving with age, it seems to have gotten worse.  

He is overly critical to people about things. He asks awkward questions about basic tasks, like ""aren't you going to season that?"" or ""can you show me how to boil water?""

He is very forgetful in regards to the hurtful things he says. He will forget something he said ~5 minutes ago. However, it also happens in debates/discussion.  

As a teenager he got several speeding tickets.  We thought he learned his lesson as it causes his car insurance to sky rocket.  $1000/month. Now 10 years later his lisence got suspended and the province wants him to take driving lessons again. 

He has never really had a girlfriend. I think he might even possibly be a virgin. Or gay? 

Is he suffering from some sort of memory disorder and social disorder?

TL:dr my bro forgets alot, doesn't learn from his mistakes, can't do basic life tasks, he finds inappropriate things funny(such as someone sincerely thanking him for help), and extremely critical to those around him even if he has never completed the task on his own. He might be a 35 year old virgin or in denial about his sexuality. 

Thanks

13,"I have a little bit of a dilemma. I’m worried that I am dealing with a serious and worsening case of anxiety/depression. I’ve had anxiety for a few years, but about ten months ago I slipped into a different state. I had gone through a lot of confusion and anger and frustration due to people doing stupid things and causing my anxiety to get worse. I started to feel worthless, unimportant, and that I was crazy. It was manageable at first, but it quickly became more than I had imagined. I started to go into spirals, they didn’t occur very often, but when I was very tired or mad at someone, I would do something/something would happen and then I would immediately over think and lose control of my thoughts. It would feel like my tiny voice of rationality was being beaten to death by the rest of mind. After the school year had ended, I thought that a break from the building and the people would help but it didn’t. I don’t know why, but I hit a point mid-August where all I did for two weeks straight was spiral over everything. It took everything to move, to eat, to sleep, to speak, to do anything. I hoped that it would only be a short time, and I reached out to some people to try and get some help counteracting my thoughts and it worked for a little while, but when school started again everything snapped. Now I’m in a place where I get very angry very quickly, I can’t handle being with more than 3 people for any length of time, I shake a lot, I always feel the need to get away from things, I’ve pushed people away, I am scared to touch doors, handles, railings, etc, and other peoples things because the idea of germs makes me feel like I’m going to contract a horrible disease and die (I wash my hands way too much at school), I can’t have people within arm’s length of me unless I trust them with my life, I have no motivation, I feel pathetic, I end up in tears every night, almost everything I do sends me spiralling. I’ve almost been hit by cars and it doesn’t scare me as much as it should. Yet when my head sends the all-intrusive “it wouldn’t be that bad if you jumped into oncoming traffic” I lose it because my fear of death can be debilitating. It’s just all so confusing. I’ve tried to get my family to see that I need help, but I’ve never told them all of this uncensored. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, I’m trying so hard to help myself but yea… I don't know what anyone can say to help, I just really needed to get it out to someone who hopefully wouldn't freak out on me.

15,"I am so sad right now.
I live with my SO. We are together for a little bit over three years and I actually am really happy with him.
He always was someone who wasn't very punctual. He sometimes wouldn't respond to texts for a few days but he would get back to you.

At the beginning of this year my father died and I had a depressive phase. I was feeling very down, didn't meet any friends outside of work, stopped going out and so on.
My SO really supported me the entire time, stayed with me, also stopped going out. 
So we just stayed at the apartment pretty much most of the time. Instead of going out we talked, watched a lot of TV series and sat in the same room, playing video games in different devices. It didn't feel that bad.

In the summer my SO had a major setback at work. It almost envolved a legal dispute. 
He really felt bad afterwards but didn't really want to talk about it. He said he would tell me eventually. So I tried to make him feel better. (I was doing better at the time and feel fine now). 
We made a few plans what we could do. We even plan to go on vacation in a few months.
Concerning the plans (little trips, etc.): we would often talk what we could do and planned to do it at the weekend and both were or are really looking forward to it at that pointn but when the time came, we both didn't feel like doing it. So we often postponed. I feel like at a moderate rate this is normal.
I don't know when exactly, but he stopped replying to any of the texts of his siblings. He would even stop visiting his parents (which we did approximately two times a month). 

One day his brother called me and said that he was worried and that my SO wasn't well and that I should talk to him. Turns out his siblings have had an intervention back in summer, because he rarely replied to their texts/rarely reacted upon their attempts to contact him. In this conversation with his siblings he said that he wasn't well, but didn't want to talk about it. I didn't realize that he was that bad. I just felt like he would play too much pc, but I didn't think that he would have any problems.
So I sat with him the next day and tried to talk to him. He said that he did not want to talk about it, but promised me to talk to me in a month. 

I waited the month, which was really difficult, because I worried so much. In this time nothing really changed. He still played much. We would watch a lot of series together, but we also went out more, partly because I initiated it, partly because we were invited and partly because he had an idea, e.g. he planned a trip for my birthday (he researched a town to visit and we did and we had an amazing time - which is actually a good sign, isn't?).

At the end of the month I sat down and talked to him. He didn't want to at first but I finally got him to talk. He said that he didn't know what to do job-related. He is not really happy with his choice of job now but thinks that it might be the nearest he could get to his dream idea of occupation. He said that there was more that he would tell me later.

Fast forward two weeks. He still hasn't visited his parents for two or three months. He has not talked to his sister who was abroad for four months, nor to his brother. He hasn't seen any of this friends for more than half year, probably more. He doesn't text them or meet them. But living with him he still wanted to cuddle often, was very sweet and said he loved me very much. Only that he plays so much and that he often would feel no desire for sex are things that I noticed. The household is something we both neglected.
It was time to drive down to visit our parents individually. I drove first. He said he wanted to do the rest of the dishes and follow the day after that. That would have been yesterday. I tried calling most of the day. He wouldn't pick up (which is something that really is different from the year before. He now is not reachable.).
Because it was christmas eve I decided to drive back. Noone knew what was up. His parents were worried and his siblings also couldn't reach him. I got to our place and he was sitting in front of his pc in the dark. He said his phone battery died and he took a walk outside earlier to state that he wasn't playing all day. He said he knew that it couldn't go in like this and that something had to change (which is a great first step, right?). I asked him what he intended to do about it and he said that he wanted to be alone to think about that. He said he knew that he was obligated to answer my questions, but that he couldn't do that right now. I asked him, if he thought that it was wise to be alone right now and he said that he chose to be alone at christmas because it was so quiet everywhere and then he would have time to think. He said that it didn't have anything to do with me. I asked him if he didn't think that it would be good to look for professionell help and he stated loud that he knew that that would not be weak, but that he didn't want to. He promised me though that he would not be too proud to search for help if he thought he needed it. He said that this was something only he himself could help himself with.

I am so desperate. I thought he would see that he cannot go through this himself. I think it is really mean to 'ruin' christmas like that for his family, who is worried and doesn't know whats up. I am angry, because he didn't say that he wanted to stay alone for christmas. 
I am worried that he will not accept any professionell help and that it will get worse or stays like this.
My mum already talks about how I should be thinking about breaking up, if he doesn't look for help. I don't want that.

Please, if you have any advice on how to convince him to get himself help, I would really apreciate it!!!

At 15 and as a kid who's only recently hit puberty, I've never really had a strong friendship outside of friends I made when I was 6 (which was situational as our parents were friends beforehand, but our friendship is still very real) I rarely go to other's houses other than to school Band-wide parties where (nearly) everyone is welcome. All the friendships I have made have never really gone past hanging out at competitions and during our school's study hall. I feel like no one wants anything to do w/ me, which I don't really understand because I'm never unpleasant to anyone. The past couple of months I've been lapsing in and out of feeling incredibly lonely and sad. Whenever I do I remind myself of how incredibly lucky I am, living in a beautiful home with loving parents and a brother who would stop at nothing to protect me, after which the sadness just kinda fades away. Basically I convince myself that I'm too well off to be depressed, this never really fixes it, just buries it. I don't know what I'm looking to get out of this thread, just needed a place to vent. Any advice would be appreciated.

17,"Some background and history on me. When I was 15 I entered a relationship with a close friend. We dated until about 2 months after my 19th birthday. I am now 20. At 17, I misscarried our child and after that he became emotionally, and physically abusive.  In the end I cheated on him using the excuse that it was a way to escape the abuse but once he was gone I deeply regretted it and fell into a deep depression. I also developed a stutter in high stress situations. 

One year later I am seeing a new man. He’s sweet, kind, wonderful and everything I want long term.  We are in the process of looking for an apartment and where supposed to have a viewing for a potential place last Wednesday.   My boyfriend had to work, but I was going to go view the apartment since I had a day off and didn’t have any plans. The night before, we stayed together at his parents house as it was easier for me to bus to the apartment showing from there than from my own apartment and I don’t have a car right now. 

About 4am on Wednesday I woke up having a massive panic attack and ended up crying on my boyfriend’s shoulder for 2 hours. I have no idea why.  Boyfriend asked me if I still felt ok to go to the viewing and I said no, so he canceled it for me and drove me back to my apartment before heading to work. 

Since then I haven’t been able to sleep at all, I’ve barely been hungry, my chronic joint pain has been acting up and I just feel the cold numb emptiness that I felt since I left my abusive ex.  The only time I’ve felt not completely lost since Wednesday is when my best friend took me out after class too work on a project together. He ended up staying at my apartment for about 5 hours just sitting and talking.

I know my mind is different, my mind has shut down many of my neutral pathways for emotion so i don't feel anything the same as most normal people and I don't expect many of you reading to fully understand without emotional bias but I really do hate it when people just blurt out ""comfort"" like the person is about to jump off a building any second. I've been contemplating suicide for some time, I doubt I'll ever go through with it but this is to everyone else, just don't say suicide is a cowardly option or that it's just the easy way out.

24,"CW: rape/sexual assault

Okay so basically I was coerced into having sex with my (at the time) best friend, and once I confronted him about it he denied everything, refused I had ever said ""no"", and turned all my friends against me. I had shown signs of depression long before the indecent, but it became really bad after. I had panic attacks and was suicidal. About a year and a half later he moved from Australia to the US temporarily. It was the best six months I had since everything went south, I felt like I could do anything without risking seeing him or his friends. Eventually I found out from a mutual friend (who was incredibly supportive of me bless her soul) that he was returning. I became incredibly anxious and ended up skipping work multiple days and I had a voice in the back of my head telling me that everyone hated me and I needed to leave forever. I went to the doctor and was prescribed anti-anxiety/depressants which kept it under control (this was January 2017 so almost a year of being on them now).

This year especially has been a roller coaster for me. Cutting to the chase, I want to forget everything that happened to me before 2015. I don't want to kill myself but I don't want to be me. I want to change myself so I am a different person. I don't want people I went to school with to recognise me. This idea in my head has bothered me so much lately that I don't feel like I am anything or anyone, I feel like I have no personality and I'm empty. To add to the mix I identify as transgender and am currently seeing a psych about transitioning next year. I'm so scared that I only identify this way because I need to be someone else, even though I've shown evidence of my identity since I was young, before I was raped. I have a desperate need for change, I get tattoos and piercings every couple of months, and I dye my hair and change my style often.

I know that I can't be diagnosed online but I'm looking for advice, could this possibly be something specific? Or just symptoms of my existing depression and anxiety? Does anyone else feel this way?",25Dec2017,7
25,"Now before I start I want an answer which can help me come to a conclusion if I am depressed or if I have some other sort of illness. I feel as if I have something without confirmation from different anons (some who might be professionals or people going through the same things)

I have suffered through three different sleep schedules over the past few weeks and all of them have been horrible and I also wanna talk about some other things that might be related.

My first will be on normal school days: I wake up with little to no sleep (Keep reading to find out why) and have to go to school and have to force myself to keep laying in bed. When I do get up Im somewhat excited to go to school to meet my friends (even though alot of the times I get ignored and feel like a Bg character), to see the teacher I have a crush on and enjoy Film. I should also mention that I am a DP student and extremely overworked, students from the A levels programs come to school for 1 or 2 hours to study their subjects (Im not saying they don’t work as hard and I might be wrong on that). We have at least 8 or 9 hours of school everyday with 1 hour of free time broken into 2 half hour breaks. We also have a lot of homework and extra things like 150 hour projects and 1300 word essays. I then come home at 3pm or 4pm depending on the day and lie in my bed for an hour until I fall asleep and don’t wake up till 7 or 8pm. I then suffer because I cant get up from my bed and 9pm rolls around till I realise I have spent one hour just watching youtube videos. Then my gym trainer comes and then I exercise till 11pm. I exercise because Im so overweight but I cant stop eating and my self confidence has gone down to an all time low. Anyway, I then have a bath and I find out its 12 or 1 am, I then decide that I’ll sit down and play some video games. This is the best part of the day because I can escape and I love analysing the games as pieces of art as I play them (I want to be a game designer among many other things in the future), eventually 3am has rolled around and I remember I have a lot of homework I have to do. I then spend time working till 5am until Im done and I sleep thus continuing the cycle. This is by far the least soul crushing but It doesn’t allow me to enjoy alot of other things I like to do or I would like to learn. It also sucks because of one other reason which I will get to...

My sleep schedule during my exams: Two major changes are that my school days have been shortened and that my parents are gone out of country which js important because my mom is the only to check up on me and keep me on track during the days. Anyway, I haven’t slept at all and I go to school at 9:00am and give my exam and come back at 11:00am and I fall asleep. I then I try to wake up at 5:00pm but the weird feeling that locks me into bed keeps me there till 7:00 and sometimes 8:00. My trainer isn’t coming and I cant study at all and slowly time passes by and I keep watching youtube videos until I realise...its 7:30am and I need to get ready for school. This is the second most soul crushing as I cant even express how guilty for not studying even though my feelings on the whole thing are a bit complicated (I will explain later). 

The last schedule is the absolute worst. Its like the one for the exams but with no studying and nothing productive except maybe drawing. I slept from 1pm to 12am (I could have woken up at 4 but for some reason I wouldn’t let myself stay awake so I kept forcing my eyes shut and I couldn’t do anything about how I was feeling) yesterday and have been up ever since and am currently writing this. It is 5:30pm Monday Christmas Day (I live in a Muslim country so No holiday spirit here atm) and like I said I woke up at 12:30am and havent slept since. I feel like I wanna die

Just general feelings
I hate everything at the moment. I feel like a dumbass because Im told to feel stupid over not knowing about shit I don’t care about. Everyone is trying to tell me to study till Im 24 so I can enter the workforce and work till I retire and die. I just want to draw and to make films and do things that Im passionate about but education and other mental blocks have me so burnt out I cant think creatively anymore. The only time I can relax is when I listen to music during the travel between the school and home. I just wanna drop out and focus all my energy into creativity and working out and in general just enjoying myself but school is holding me back. I know Im 16 and i just have a few more years left but i know that my education wont help me later on in careers people can start online by creating followings (such as artist, musician, film maker etc.)

26,"Hello. I started attending to psychiatrist due to feeling very low and suicidial for several years. He gave me medication and after couple visits reffered to psychologist to make a personality test. Results shown that I might have passive-aggressive personality disorder althought psychologist told me that this disorder in ICD-10 is equally to borderline personality disorder from DSM-IV. Then after a while I ended up in hospital due to suicide attempt. In hospital psychiatrist told me that I've got mixed personality disorder and it's hard to describe in detail. I'm just tired of all of this. I'm feeling incredibly lost and abandoned. What's wrong with me? How can I get exact diagnosis?

*I am looking for advice for 1) getting over the loss of my most recent relationship and 2) moving on from an abusive childhood.*

**Intro:**

I was broken up with this past June shortly after graduating college. J (24 m) and I dated for over 5 years. He was undeniably the most supportive person in my life and I thought I had finally found my true ""family"".

I still cry/ugly cry, especially at night, and frequently stay up upwards of 7 am ruminating/crying until I essentially pass out from exhaustion.

I have experienced a variety of physical, verbal, and emotional abuse from my parents for as long as I can remember (since ~5 y/o) that has never been addressed or resolved. I have experienced sexual assault/harassment from numerous strangers also starting from a young age (pre-10 y/o). 

Due to my own choices, I ended up with a degree in a field I do not enjoy, but I ""powered through"" to graduation to ""get it over with"" so I could move onto the next stage in my life. Changing majors twice made me have to take an additional year, and I am in debt with my parents for 5 years of college education.

I have had chronic depression and suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember. Only recently diagnosed by the college psychiatrist since I never went to a professional prior.

I only recently sought professional help during the latter half of my last year in college (used the on-campus counseling center) but discontinued therapy sessions and antidepressant medication since I could no longer receive treatment via my college and my insurance likely will not fully/mostly cover treatment cost.

I am currently unemployed despite job searching/application attempts and had to move back in with my parents due to the break up. Since we had been dating for so long and talked on numerous occasions about living together after I graduated, I had planned on living with J. Despite my efforts, I was not able to find a place that would rent to me before the lease was up (end of this summer) since I was unemployed, it was short-notice, and I had two cats.


**Details (basically my life story):**

It has been over half a year since my break up with J, but I am still mourning the loss of the relationship and everything it represented- escape from my abusive parents that only remind me of my painful past, a new life of hope and happiness for the future, and diminishing or eliminating my depression and suicidal ideation related to parents and childhood. 

After the break up, we were still living in the same rented house (along with two friends) and room. He opted to sleep on the couch, but it was extremely uncomfortable for him, so I was okay with him sleeping in the bed (he was letting me use it even though it was technically his bed). For better or for worse, he ended up moving in with a friend a few weeks after the break up. This meant that he also moved all of his furniture and belongings out of the house and bedroom as well leaving me with no bed or dresser (also the couch, tv, and tv stand). He graciously bought me an inflatable bed, as sleeping on the hardwood floor was very uncomfortable even with several layers of blankets. 

The few weeks right after the break up was probably the height of both my depression and suicidal ideation. I ugly cried myself to sleep every night and broke down several times during the day by anything related to romantic relationships, sadness, love, or hope. It was especially bad after he moved out because it ""hit me"" that he was gone. All I had left was a mostly empty bedroom and living room where he used to be with me for so long. J was not just my most significant romantic partner, but he had also become my best friend that I trusted with my life and all of my baggage. I confided in him about pretty much everything from my childhood and he was always supportive and caring. The only other people I told about my past were the college counselor and psychiatrist and then two people later after the break up when I needed to talk to *someone* about things.

After he moved out, I had very prominent thoughts about active ways I could potentially kill myself (eg-
 cutting, shooting, jumping off a bridge) whereas all the years prior to the break up, the suicidal thoughts were mostly passive (eg- dying in my sleep, disappearing into thin air, being a victim of an accident someone else caused). I have a few light bulb memories of when I thought about cutting my major arteries when I was younger, but those were the minority. Mostly I just wanted to disappear and stop existing. 

Although I've had suicidal thoughts for the vast majority of my life, I never attempted. I would ""think"" my way out of it- essentially convince myself that death is not 100% guaranteed, and that I may end up maiming/disabling myself or get caught in the act and sent to a pysch ward. I thoroughly do not enjoy pain, so I did not want to risk suffering *more* pain on top of the mental and physical pain I've already been through and suffer with nearly every day. I also thought of my friends who would be saddened by my passing, but more than anything, I thought about how it would make J feel. There were numerous times, especially in my senior year of college (when the depression and suicidal thoughts were climbing) when J and a life with him (without living with the dirty housemates) was my reason for living. I convinced myself to trudge through those times for a better life away from that situation in my life/career. After the break up and to this day, I still have thoughts like:

 *""What's the point of living? I have nothing to live for anymore. The person I wanted to spend my life with and put all my affection towards is gone. My best friend is gone. I'm back to where I was before college-with parents that I feel no affection for and in an environment that only reminds me of pain from the past. I have a degree in a field I hate, keep getting refused by employers, and am in major debt with my abusive parents.""*

I feel like I'm stuck in a viscous cycle of: depression from unresolved childhood trauma &gt; living with parents in an environment that constantly reminds me of childhood trauma &gt; can't get professional help because my insurance won't cover all of it and I have limited funds since unemployed&gt; don't feel like I can ask my parents for more money to cover therapy costs because I already owe them so much &gt; depression and suicidal thoughts keep spiraling due to loss, environment, and seemingly inability to get out of situation

I realize you may be wondering why I waited so long to seek help, so I will explain my reasoning and more about childhood. 

My parents were extremely ""protective"" and controlling when I was a young (quotations because pretty much anything that broke the rules resulted in corporal punishment, yelling, and/or revoking privileges). I was mostly kept in the house. I was allowed to play in the yard when they were home/supervising, but was rarely allowed to go to a friend's house. I only had one friend on that street (on a cul-de-sac in middle-class white suburbia) who was 4 years younger than me (other kids closer to my age, but they were boys who I either didn't get along with or who thought it was ""uncool"" to play with a girl). My mom did not approve of me playing with a girl who was 4 years younger than me. I had school friends, but rarely was allowed to visit them. When I was allowed, I had to contact my parents every hour. I am also an only child, so it's not like I had a sibling to play with. 

There were pretty strict rules with the house too. I remember leaving a towel I used to wipe off with after playing outside to dry on the towel bar. Apparently it had fallen on the ground, and I was slapped and yelled at for it. And by slapped, I mean **slapped**. I'm talking full body momentum slap (and that was on the ""nicer"" end of physical punishment). Keep in mind I have always been small (in size and height) compared to my peers. I was spanked in my underwear until I was beet red and numb from the pain for going to play with my friend on the street (literally a few hundred feet away) when I didn't get permission once. Each hit was hard enough to cause the air to puff out of my lungs.

Might as well keep going with the physical stuff. You know the PS2 game Rampage ( co-op game where you play as a huge ape or lizard lady to destroy cities)? When you ""die"" you change back into human form, and other players can eat you for points to no consequence of the ""dead player"" (you might actually respawn faster, if I recall correctly). I was punched to the ground for eating my dad's character model. I have a few memories of my 200+ lb, 6'2"" father throwing me to the ground, pinning me with his body, and choking me with both of his hands while yelling at me as I repeated ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" to try to get him to stop. I don't remember why. Also have a memory of standing in my parent's bedroom looking at my dad holding a belt and feeling terror. I don't know if he actually used it on me or if that's just what I was afraid of at the time. At least on a weekly basis, I feared that I would get hit or yelled at for whatever reason. I remember a few times where I begged my mom to take me with her to go grocery shopping or whatever so I wouldn't be stuck in the house alone with my dad. She wouldn't take me even though I was frantically begging her, crying, following her to the door, and pounding on the window when her car was backing out of the driveway. I've also watched, frozen in fear, as my dad beat our cats for doing something ""bad"". I woke up one night to the sound of a cat in distress. From my bedroom, I could see into the hallway bathroom. He was dunking one of the cat's head in the toilet bowl over and over. Although my parents often fought and yelled at each other, I never once saw, heard, or saw evidence of my dad hitting my mom. The physical stuff was saved for me and the cats, I guess.

My mom was also a source of physical trauma, but she's 5'2"" and ~110 lbs, so the force was never as strong. Also it was most slaps or spanks, not punching and choking. When my dad physically hurt me, she was either not around, or would just watch as it happened while I looked to her for help. Although she was not a great source of physical trauma, she was a large source of mental and emotional suffering. Other than being controlling about where I get to go and who I get to be friends with, she also didn't let me pursue interests. Eg- she didn't outright make me play the flute, but she didn't let me: play percussion, play brass, or play instruments with a reed, but I still had to play in the school band. Like a stereotypical Asian, I also was forced to play the piano and violin. She did not let me pursue sports or martial arts. For several years, she tried to push ""feminine"" toys and interests on me while putting down other interests. She would make snide remarks at my physical looks and appearance (I have never been overweight or even close to it). Until being convinced otherwise by friends and others in college, I always put myself at ""average 6/10"", though I've been told I'm more of an 8/9 (and would objectively put myself at at least 8/10). The point being that she often put me down in roundabout ways that affected my body image and self-esteem for the majority of my life. She also saved all of her wrath for me. She was (and continues to be) quite two-faced. My dad is horrible at picking up on body language and non-verbal cues, so he doesn't notice when she's pissed off about something or at him (until he goes really overboard and she snaps). However, I learned to pick up on slight changes in her body language, expressions, tone, and sentence structure pretty early on since that would result in her anger being taken out on me as soon as my dad was gone. 

They both would more-often-than-not get angry at each other or from other sources, and then take it out on me in whatever way they wanted. I would get blamed for things the other one did (like leaving dirty dishes, not putting something away, not locking the door). Oh, and to keep with the Asian stereotypes, I would get seriously verbally grilled for A- and below grades on anything (not just total, but individual assignments too). Privileges revoked for below A-. Just them angrily gesturing with their arms and hands was enough to make me winch and flinch back for fear of being hit. Related, I've only in recent years come to be okay with things touching my neck (eg- J's hand wrapping around the back, necklaces, shirt/jacket collars). I still prefer to not have collared clothing, but it doesn't cause me to be irrationally uncomfortable. Oh, also remembered that I was told I was ""unwanted"" and that they thought of aborting me. Only things I could think of then and when I remember are things like *gee, you don't say, no shit*, and *I wish you would have*. 

As to why I didn't seek help- I *did* seek help from friends and school faculty, but was met with disbelief, urging me to keep it hidden, or the faculty going directly to my parents asking if what I said was true. Ha, maybe that's a reason why I was choked out. Since I couldn't really trust my parents and had uncomfortable experiences with (likely) pedophiles, it was already difficult for me to trust other adults. This mistrust was further exemplified when they didn't do anything to resolve issues at school. Eg- a boy would chase girls (including me) around the playground and grab us by the back of the shirt/jacket, thereby causing a choking sensation when he caught us. We went to the teacher supervising about this, and she just gave him a talking to like ""don't do that, it's not nice"" and then told us that ""boys just do that to girls they like"" (this is a whole 'nother social issue). He would do this on a daily basis. There was a kid on my bus who literally stalked me. I didn't even know who he was (only recognized him) and he wasn't in my grade. The issue was only resolved when I (quite accidentally) hit him in the stomach with my flute case when I quickly turned around to yell at him to stop following me. I got called into the principal's office where I learned from the stalker that he thought I liked him because I had apparently hit him with my backpack when I was going down the bus aisle one day. Obviously I was quite confused as this was as stupid thought process in my mind and I didn't remember ever doing that. The adults (principal and some teacher) talked to me a bit afterwards about how ""boys will be boys"" etc. A different teacher had also forced me to get on a bus that wasn't mine (I did not see my bus at the end of a school day and went to a supervising teacher for help). Obviously since it wasn't my bus and the kids on that bus were not the same people on my route, I did not want to ride it. The teacher still made me ride it. Unsurprisingly, the bus did not stop by my street and I was stuck in an empty bus with a confused, unknown bus driver. There was another kid who tried to steal my work- we passed our homework to the kid in front of us, then the teacher collected from the front of each column. The kid in front of me erased my name and put his own, then threw away his packet (learned a bit later). After collecting the homework, the teacher asked me where mine was. I looked through the packets and found the one with my handwriting and a hastily erased and written name of the shit kid. I pointed it out saying it was my handwriting, and that I can prove it by writing, and that the other kid should have to write as well to ""prove"" whose it was. Teacher didn't believe me until a different kid sharpening his pencil by the trashcan found the shit kid's real (unfinished) packet in the trash. A particularly angry lunch lady had some vendetta against me for some reason. She blamed me for making messes that I didn't make, and would force me to stay in the cafeteria and clean instead of going to recess. 

Purpose of these events is to help convey why I did not trust adults. If they couldn't handle small, trivial stuff like this or trust me at my word, why would they be able to help me with larger problems? At least that's what I thought as a child. 

By the time middle school came around, I made a vow to myself to never have kids so that I would not treat them like how I was treated. (Over time I've added several other reasons like financial, don't like kids anyways, having a leech in my body causing hormone imbalances, pregnancy and possible birth complications, etc). Throughout middle and high school, I basically shut off my emotions and was ""going through the motions"" of living. I would come home and go straight to my room to do homework or ""do homework"" (use it as a reason to isolate myself from them to avoid contact). Due to a lot of other problems with peers/strangers, I had lost pretty much all hope in people. They just want to use you and only come to you when they want something from you or will try to hurt you just because they can. (Aside: I really hate how in school they kept preaching that, to get a bully to stop bothering you, ignore them. That never worked for me, and I was bullied pretty often since I was smaller, of a minority, female, and looked unassuming. I tried going to authority figures and being passive, but they just kept coming back. I finally had enough (elementary, middle, and high school) and I met the physical violence with violence. The bullies literally never came back after getting their asses beat/humiliated). 

Essentially, I closed off myself from the world to avoid being hurt and betrayed. I had made some close school friends throughout childhood and teen years, but most moved away and we lost contact, or I moved away from them. It was painful for me to lose people who I could trust and feel companionship with, so I stopped trying. That is, until college. 

I saw college as a ""fresh start"" away from ""home"" and my parents. I felt an immense sense of freedom. I can say with 100% certainty that the first couple years of my college experience were the happiest years of my entire life. I still have several friends from those years, but a large portion of that happiness came from J (the now ex-boyfriend of over 5 years). Unfortunately, the years of trauma were still in the back of my mind, and the depression came creeping back as my college career went on. I think this is largely due to not knowing what I wanted to do for a career path, choosing majors that didn't fit with me, having to take another year of college due to switching, and racking up debt with my abusive parents, who I wanted to cut dies with as soon as possible. My living situation during senior year (this past year) was especially bad- the other two housemates were very messy. I suppose I was very used to a clean, tidy environment due to my upbringing. I am fine with some messiness, but having old food crumbs all over, wrappers and trash strewn about, sink, stove top, and counters full of dirty dishes, piss-stained toilets and hair covered sinks and toilets is too much. It especially bothered me because, right at the beginning of living together, I took the time and energy to draft ""house rules"" which I thought were quite reasonable and went over the rules with everyone so we could discuss/amend. I also shared it with them online so they could access it whenever. They agreed but didn't follow the vast majority of the rules (such as checking the door lock before going to bed, cleaning shared cookware you used before going to bed, cleaning your dirty dishes/utensils by the end of the week, taking out the trash before it is literally overflowing, replacing the toilet roll when you use the last of it). Asking nicely/reminding of rules/asking if we should amend the agreed upon rules had no lasting effect. They would clean if I outright asked, but did not continue to do so. I did more than my fair share of cleaning, only to have the house be a disgusting mess by the end of the week. It was exhausting to come ""home"" after work and/or classes when already dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts to a place that I did not feel comfortable in, and that I did not feel respected at. My skin gets physically irritated by dirt and grime, so my wishes to have a fairly clean home were not unjustified (other than just not wanting to literally live in other people's filth). 

Back to the main issues. J and I had talked about our plans for the future when it would be ""just us"". He promised that he would take care of me. He was there to comfort me and listen to me when I talked about my past and my parents. He was totally accepting and not afraid of me (I was quite weary of telling him the whole truth due to social stigmas about people with severe depression and suicidal thoughts). We talked about our ""end game"" plans- the house and rooms we'll have, our pets, places around the world we'd see...unfortunately for me, it seems the long-term effects of my progressing cloud of depression caused him to ""fall out of love"" with me. From some talks I've had with him post-break up, it seems the toll of comforting me was wearing away at him. He just didn't have the energy to keep doing it day in and day out. I relied too much on him because, at the time, I didn't know how much it was affecting him because he was very good at hiding it and I was too preoccupied with how I was feeling. Even though I can objectively understand how he could fall out of love (as I became much more depressed and pessimistic than the renewed person I was the first few years of college), I don't know how to get over the tremendous loss of hope, happiness, and love that J represented. After years and years of pain and shutting people out to avoid more pain, I had opened up and found what I think ""family"" should be- a person or people that you can trust, rely on, and feel safe with...someone who you stand by through thick and thin because you love each other and want to be together. Prior to those first few years of college, I was just existing and going through the motions. I feel like all the suffering in the last couple years of college (when the depression and suicidal thoughts came back) was for nothing. I'm back to having nothing. Just emptiness, pain, and hopelessness. 

If it wasn't for my mom getting sick when she did, I probably would have been dead by now. The week prior to my mom getting sick and staying home for a week, I had gotten ready to leave. I packed up mementos to send to a few close friends. I wrote personalized goodbye letters to the few close friends and a generic one to friends in outer circles. I wrote a very lengthy goodbye letter to J. I typed up emails to some professors/the therapist and psychiatrist who tried to help me. I wrote my will and a curt letter for my parents. I felt a strange sort of calm- like I had totally accepted my imminent death. I had mustered enough conviction, energy, and motivation to go out and buy my one-way ticket out of Painsville. Buuuuut then my mom got sick and was at home. This was a problem for my plans because my parents always want to know where I'm going if/when I go out. They will say they want to come along. Nowadays, they act like nothing is wrong, and get offended when I'm not affectionate with them or don't spend extended amounts of time with them. I don't know how they can act ""normal"" like everything during childhood/teen years didn't happen. I'm afraid to bring it up because 1) I know I'll get emotional and break down, 2) I am afraid of them getting defensive and angry, and 3) a peer I talked to with a similar past confronted his parents but didn't get conclusive answers as to ""why"" they did those things (they basically said ""we don't know"").


Holidays and other special days since the break up have been really hard. My birthday- I've spent the last 4 birthdays with J. This time, J sent ""happy birthday"" but doesn't talk to me otherwise unless I initiate, and is pretty curt when replying. Thanksgiving- I've spent all but one of the past 5 Thanksgivings with him (either with his family or with mine). This time I felt obligated to spend most of the days with my parents to keep them appeased. Christmas- been visiting a friend away from home, but am returning ""home"" today. I've spent 3 Christmases with J. Might be the reason I finally got around to making this submission.

I've been typing for ~4 hours. Thank you so much for reading- I know it's a lot of text. I have to eat something before my flight back ""home"" a little later this morning. I'll be back later to edit/reply.

I can't talk to my dad about it because he'll tell me to ""man up"" and then proceed to mock me. He's not particularly nasty, but more unbelieving in the fact that I can have any REAL problems because of the perfect life he's provided for me. My mom isn't much help either because she blows everything way out of proportion and no matter what, the final consensus on anything in my house is taken by my dad. I used to go through these ""phases"" where I would become severely depressed/ unmotivated/sad(or whatever other emotion related to depression there is) and think over every. single. thing ive ever done to ruin my life and now they've become way way worse, to the point that they're ruining my life. A year ago, I was a popular guy in my grade and a complete extrovert. Now, I have about five acquaintances at best and only one person who I can actually trust. Every single one of my old ties has been strained because of me either being too rude or upfront, or just not wanting to talk to people at all. Then I start going through times where I have super disturbing thoughts about people who annoy me. They scare me as well because no one ""normal"" should ever think about stuff like that. I have no idea what to do with my life and the only thing stopping me from ending it is the fact that no matter what I do, I can never put my family through that because I love them(even though sometimes, they get mad at my behaviour and start screaming things like I'm just selfish and don't actually care about them which hurts me a lot more). The only reason I'm even posting here is because I'm confused and needed a place to spell out exactly what I was going through and really want someone to help me go back to my old life. ",25Dec2017,1
34,"Just wanted to ask what other people think. 

Everybody is insecure about something, and especially when you are a teenager (which I am). It's a part of life, and I think everybody can agree that you don't need help for that. 

But at what point does it become different?

I've always thought I was just insecure, but the way that I experience it seems wrong and not like how other people describe it. 

Ever since I can remember I've hated myself as a human being. I honestly do feel as though I don't deserve to exist because I have nothing to contribute. And every sentence or word I speak I play it back in my head and I can hear how stupid it sounds. And it makes me not want to speak, because I can see myself from others perspectives and I hate them. I feel as though my personality is trapped inside my brain and I can't translate it. My personality is horrific and I can't stand to listen to myself. Even the way I walk or move my hands makes me want to vomit. 

I think the first time I felt this way was 10, and it hasn't stopped. I have no idea what to do about it. 

Does anyone else have any experience with this, for example as a teenager does everyone have this and then recovers once they become an adult? That's what I hope will happen. 

Edit: Reading this post back makes me want to tear my own eyes out.",25Dec2017,6

38,"A confession, ive always have the thought of things are better off without me, like it dont matter if i exist or not. And i have this bad habit of bottling up every emotion i have and try to make it look as though everything is perfect, i think thats some kind of coping mechanism i developed and i like to say im good at it. None of the people around me know i feel this way, not my family, girlfriend/exgf, best friend, none. ive never talked to anyone about it. 

Anyway the point of this is, sometimes i do think of taking my own life and whats scary is i can visualise it. Just want to know, is this normal? am i overthinking? 

Sorry for ranting, thought i should put thing in perspective",25Dec2017,1
39,"My mental fatigue seems to have begun after I was catfished online once, when I was 16. Needless to say, it really changed something in me psychologically. I noticed the fatigue very soon after, and I've been thinking of getting into hypnotherapy for the trauma.

I used to think it was just depression and anxiety, with the ""typical"" brain fog and such. Now I'm diagnosed schizophrenic, but I'm getting no explanations.

I really want to sooner understand what exactly is wrong with me. My parents are delaying setting up with a psychologist, and I don't have much mental energy to do it myself or to constantly remind them. I have somewhat severe social anxiety as well. I've been looking at online therapy, but it is much too expensive for someone living in Eastern Europe/Latvia. And just talking to other people barely helps, as I can NEVER find someone else that feels like me.",25Dec2017,15
40,"Hey guys,

I just went trough my innerself speaking and I just dont know what to think. My life just feels weird. I havent accomplished anything and the vision to the future doesnt looks any better. I feel like I have addiction to social sites and internet as a whole. I was pretty happy to 16years then something broke up in me and I dont feel anything good in me. Only time I actually felt that my life is having meaning was when I was in relationship 21-23. but then it just felt a part and now I feel even worse then before. I dont feel like I have meaning in my life I dont help anybody even myself. I just feel lost. It feels like I am just surviving from day to day. I feel like my mental state is not right and I dont know how to fix that god damn chemicals in my head. Like now I get why ppl are drug addicts when there is nothing to live for. So at least you can get something from the life. ",25Dec2017,3

42,"Hi all. I'm looking for some advice on what to do in my situation, maybe some personal accounts or opinions from others with similar symptoms, who to go see in particular...

Im a 25 year old male. I've been struggling with extreme ""down periods"" that I feel for 2 or more years now. I call it depression or a depressive disorder to myself but it's not officially diagnosed so I don't vocally, except with my girlfriend and mother who I have welcomed to this side of me.  These down periods often start with some sort of trigger. 

Usually the extreme sadness will last many hours or until the next day. I this isn't just ""oh I feel sad"". Rather, I almost feel like a totally different person. I am not in control of my mood or my thoughts during these times. It happens usually once a week, and I don't feel normal again until the next day. 

What I feel in these periods:

* extreme periods of sadness, sometimes anxiety
* self-doubt
* guilt 
* low confidence 
* paranoia in relationships (not that I think they'll hurt me, more that I feel like my relationships aren't as strong to others as I perceive them to myself)
* low motivation
* Irritability towards others
* extreme hopelessness
* Wonder if I'll be like this forever
* Worry that it'll change to self-harm related thoughts. Often I wonder if it's worth it for me to be living
* Selfishness
* Constant racing thoughts (worries) about how I make others feel, or how they feel about me. Do I have real friends? Do I annoy them? Do they like me? Do they just keep me around because they know I like them?

Usually I feel overall ""fine"", but not exactly happy. I definitely overall don't feel exactly happy in my normal state, and I think before leaving college  and moving to a major city I could say I was generally happy. I am also aware of the fact that at any time a trigger could cause me to slip into a depressive state for the remainder of the day. The trigger can be anything from worrying about being late to work to a major fight with my girlfriend to financial stress. 

I am usually aware that I am in the negative state when I am, but I can't help feeling it. Sometimes I can recognize it and start to do things to help it, but usually not.

I most often wonder if I have bipolar depressive disorder, though I think the highs and lows of that generally last longer than what I'm feeling. I also don't think I have many ""highs."" If I do, I would say it's when I'm with very close friends, as this is when I'm usually happiest. 

I'm more than happy to provide whatever other info you may want to know, though I don't really even know what I'm looking for right now. I'm doubting myself that I should even be submitting this as I'm typing it, as if it's not worth it.

Today it was caused by opening presents. My mom, who puts a lot of time and thought into Christmas, got me several wrong colors/sizes of clothing I had asked for. Now I wasn't super sad about this, but I could tell she was upset about my disappointment. I couldn't get past this, and it spiraled out of control to the point that I had to go lay in my bed to be by myself. 

I did finally seek out a therapist this summer. She mostly just talked with me, but didn't really offer many opinions of what was happening to me. The most she offered were small exercises to work through this stuff. Regardless, talking helped a bit. Unfortunately, my work changed health insurance and now my psychotherapy benefits are very small; I can't continue to go. 

I did express my concern about having some mental disorder that I felt like I didn't know how to diagnose, but she kind of blew it off? It seemed like she doubted it. I felt offended and not taken seriously. This was the last session as well.

I know my mom and my father's mother also battled depression.

Does anyone experience anything similar? What's the most efficient route to get an opinion from a medical professional, and start to help this? Anything you guy's got will help. Thanks.",25Dec2017,4
43,"Okay, so my sister and brother in law have left for 2 days, but the nanny is here. She's a younger women, in her 20s, currently in school.  I keep forgetting she's here. My parents are used to me acting weird, making weird noises, and saying strange things. It's all nonsense, and I know it. I'm not really crazy.

45,"Hi there! Ever since I was a child, I have never talked a great deal, I am quite the introvert. Actually, I think when I was two &amp; three, I didn't really talk at all, I will have to ask my parents. Anyway, it has come to several people's attention that I am different from everybody else. According to people at school, I say things at the wrong time, when I talk. They also claim that I never talk, but when I do, I won't shut up. They also say that I talk about the same topic or an event that happened **over and over again**. I would have just thought this to be social awkwardness, but then my mom noticed that I, quite embarrassingly, have tantrums at times. Apart from that, I am extremely sensitive. The slightest touch from somebody makes me tickle. Whenever I step outside, it's too bright to see. I have to squint pretty hard to be able to look around. Sound can irritate me, too, and if too much is going around, it's as if it all plays at one volume. Originally, I thought that I may have just had ADHD (I cannot sit still to save my life), but having zero friends for all of my life, being sensitive to everything, to the point where almost every food makes me gag it up, and not knowing how to talk to people, at all, definitely ruled that out. So, I am kinda lost as to what I *may* have. Sorry if that was lengthy, and sorry if I have broken any rules. I only made a Reddit account to see what other people thought before anything happens! **Also, for those concerned about me - I could care less about having friends, just give me a book about airplanes, a sketchbook, or a computer and I'll be happy!**",25Dec2017,2
46,"I don't think I have anything seriously wrong with me, but I am on the verge of happiness/unhappiness.  It could be the holiday season has me down, but I'm really feeling the loss of being estranged from my family.  My dad passed away about five years ago and my one brother has not spoke with me since finding out my dad left everything to me.  My other brother is a recovering drug addict. I spoke with the second brother but we rarely see each other.  My mother is estranged from me, by my choice, because she lives with a suspected child molester and I have two young daughters... so I don't want to even let this man look at my children, let alone have contact with them in any way.

My husband is in the military and we move often.  We just moved six months ago to where I think will be our final home until my husband retires.

Every move has been a huge effort for me to make friends, who in turn move away and then eventually I move away, only to have to start over again.

My mother in law is visiting and she is a control freak and I don't have the patience to put up with much of that, so we clash. I mostly ignore and avoid her, but it's unavoidable to do that completely with her staying with us for two weeks.  She stinks (hasn't showered in the six days she has been here), and jumps at every little mistake I make (I think because she feels inadequate).  She has been like this for years and I'm not going to change her, so I try and do my best to avoid her, but it's ruining my Christmas.  She goes home in six days so I'm counting down the days.  Last night we went to a neighbours house and my MIL took over the conversation the whole night, telling exaggerated stories and I found it very trying. I did not enjoy the evening as a result.

I am 48 and recently joined the local seniors club, which has a lot of activities but they aren't cheap! I'm not working and my husband makes okay money but nothing to brag about, so I can't afford to do much at the centre. I have joined a local community church that seems to have some wonderful people but I find it difficult to make good friends.  It used to be so easy, but now I don't know if it's because I'm older, less attractive, overweight and therefore less confident?  Maybe I'm more depressed than I realize... I thought I was just bummed out from having moved again, and having to ""start all over"" with making friends and social connections.

I do see a therapist, and will mention all this to him but I'm hoping to get input from others if there's anything I should consider.",25Dec2017,5
47,"Here's the deal, I don't really know what the heck it is I'm dealing with.

I'm a university student, this is my first semester, and my life is ruled by what I'm gonna call anxiety, but honestly just feels like a growing pitt in my chest that throws me into a panic attack whenever stress starts creeping in.

I probably shouldn't have let this get this bad before getting help, but I did, and it sucks, and every waking moment feels like a struggle.

I'm not suicidal, but I am increasingly miserable, and I feel like I'm being increasingly buried under the weight of this pitt.

I've reached out yesterday to the school's mental health service, filled out the forms, they told me I won't actually be able to see a human therapist for at least 2 weeks. Which leaves me stuck.

I feel awful, I'm way past just lagging behind my classmates, and every interaction feels like a choice between lying to someone, and admitting to them that I'm going through a slow motion ""breakdown"" of some sort. That I personally don't even quite have the hang of yet.

It's all exhausting, and I just don't know how I'll be able to pass the time in the interim.

God, I shouldn't have let this get this bad before seeking help. At Least my parents know what's up, I know people care for me, I've got a support network.

Anyone got any ideas?",25Dec2017,2

49,"Hello,

&amp;nbsp;

I am using a temporary account, since my family, friends and people from college know about my normal account.

&amp;nbsp;

I need help, and hopefully some of the people reading this can help me with it.

&amp;nbsp;

Let me shortly introduce myself : I am a 20 year old boy from the Netherlands (Europe), and my life is a wreck. I am not healthy, I don't look healthy, I haven't done any sport for years and I finally start to feel better after an almost 6-year during depression. I am starting to feel better, smile more and be more happy in general, but I need to improve my health to help me processing further.

&amp;nbsp;

Well, I will try to describe my own health that I want to improve : 
My teeth are yellow, I have a few holes in my teeth. Last years I had some periods I haven't brushed my teeth in about 4 months, if not more..

My skin is rough and red, and I have bags under my eyes. While almost my whole depression I haven't done anything about facial care, and I just don't know how I need to care for my face.
I am feeling sleepy and exhausted all the time.
My body hygiene is not that good either, I showered very little, but the solution to that is just to shower more and clean my body better.

My hair and beard haven't really got good care, my hair feels dirty a lot, and I just do not know how I need to care for my hair and beard.

I am slighly overweight (about 7 kilograms), I am thinking to do something about sport, biking or jog.

Since a while I am studying again, what is a good thing, but I am late really often, mostly because I just can't come out of bed, because I wake up tired.

&amp;nbsp;

I am thinking about those changes for a while now, but I just don't know how I should do those things. I have been thinking about jogging or biking in the morning, after waking up, then take a shower and go off to school. But I don't know if I should have breakfast before going to sport, or after sporting/showering..
I also have been thinking about going earlyer to bed, about 10:00am / 10:30am for waking up that early.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I really would appreciate help in any way possible, I really want to improve my health, but there are just so many things I don't know how I should do it.",25Dec2017,3
50,"Hi Folks,

First some background- Brother moved out of the country a few years ago to study, and has been diagnosed with depression with a hefty side order of anxiety. About a year and a half back he confessed to my parents that he had had some suicidal thoughts. He got some help with his depression and anxiety (as far as some counseling and medication), but has recently been lashing out at people around him and cutting any contact with my parents and his ex girlfriend/ best friend abroad. as far as i know i am the only person he maintains a close relationship with and quite frankly i am terrified of saying the wrong thing and having him cut contact with me as well. When i said above possibly bipolar, i mean that some days when i chat with him online he is super happy and outgoing and other days he is surly and cuts the chat short if anything uncomfortable comes up.
