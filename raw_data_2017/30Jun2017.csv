4,"My official diagnosis is Major Deppressive disorder and anxiety.  But some new symptoms emerged.

I think I'm in a middle of a manic state.  I spent over $6500 on film equipment to learn video editing so that I can make YouTube videos and be famous.

I have drawn out plans on how to get away with murder.   I think I can do it.

I've thought of just leaving everything and just disappearing into the ether and just start a new life.

Also, while I'm in this state, I have bad mood swings. I'd be happy to suicidal to laughing like crazy,  to beo my irritated by even the smallest thing and throwing  stuff around. The mood swings started happening a few days ago.  I cried at work today because no one noticed I did my hair differrently.

I've  been off my meds because of insurance and financial reasons (lol).  

Is this something I should be concerned about? I do have an appt with my psych coming up in like 11 days.   I just don't know on what I should I do to help myself.   I went to an MHMR clinic for help they rejected me and I cried in my car.  I almost walked into traffic in front of their office to get revenge.

I sound like an absolute bitch, and this really isn't like me.  I feel like I switched brains with someone else.   I don't want to be like this. ",30Jun2017,2

Somebody is struggling and then that crap of a treatment is recommended. Does not actually help the problem at all. 

Makes me want to give up entirely. Accept it?????

8,"For background, I have comorbid ADHD and general anxiety disorder and recently have started regularly taking Adderall. I've started seeing side effects from the pills, and it's been kind of rough adjusting to it. 

I was laying next to my boyfriend, feeling horribly numb for no reason. As he was falling asleep, he put is hand on my cheek and immediately I teared up, but I don't know why. However, after he did that, the numb feeling went away and I now feel better than I've felt in over a week.

16,"When I was a baby I cried 23 hours of the day merely stopping to sleep. I'd have weird dreams, and I recall this man would appear in them and it'd cause me to wake up. I spoke of having memories that weren't mine, such as being a man who lived sometime in the 20s who died prematurely, and a spouse relationship. Sometimes I would get visions of this 'spouse' (I was around 2-3). I told my parents about this 'spouse' as if it were normal and proudly exclaimed; ''she is 110 today''.

One day I 'heard' a voice coming from my room telling me I had work to do. I became frozen with fear. I thought someone was in my room but there wasn't. I felt like I was going nuts. Late at night I'll hear tapping or scratching in the walls next to where I sit at my computer.

I kept having dreams about that man. Or he would interrupt dreams and I'd wake up. Sometimes I get a startling feeling of being watched and it would seem I can't control my body temperature well because I suddenly feel like the room has gone cold. I feel an odd attachment to the man. I told myself out loud that this is stupid and then I felt pressure on my throat like something was gently pressing down on my adamsapple, just soft enough that I could still breathe normally.

20,"I starting to get really hit by my fears and loneliness, it is becoming unberable i can't sleep and it is feeling like i have anxiety.

Paranoia and anxiety aren't the same thing however they have a little resemblance to each other and that is why my heart is getting beaten to a bloody pulp.

Or this house i live in is sincerely haunted or i am that paranoid, at first it was just shadow people now it is pale people wtf did i do to diserve this!?

I can't trust my so called grandma anymore because she believes that i am jeovah's chosen one from what i know god does not punish people for no reason at all.

It's like 3:00 AM and i can't sleep, i get a feeling something or someone is chasing me it fucking annoys me.

And because i feel alone and abandoned i am here typing this just to get a little pat in my shoulder, maybe someone cares about me..?
I really feel like i should end it, right now.

I am stupid for not trying before, because there where some pills lying around and i could have just overdosed my self.

Since i was a kid i was always haunted by some terrifying imagery when i was a kid i saw images of corpses when i tried to sleep and i remember punching a skeleton that just came out of the toilet..wtf?

I am starting to get pushed to the egde all suddently because i feel lonely and abandoned thanks to parents and co.

I wish my grandma wasn't a asshole about it.

Which reminds me of delusions i have, if one day you have a delusion i bet 10/10 it will be weird and/or scary.

It is so weird to know that ypu believe in a lie but somehow you believe in it still.
And i can be really shaming.

I believe that the so called humans are all robots made with human souls called necroids i invented a explanation..

I believe i am dead that i died along time ago when i firstly commited suicide.

I believe that my grandma invented necroids and she is the master chief she is evil.

I don't believe that anything is real because i am dead and i live in a copy of the real world.

I would say that all these claims are believable and that i have no friends and i kinda wish i was dead seeing all these ""people"" with friends i really wish i had any but i am too afraid to make some.

Because i sincerely don't know anything about socializing...

I have a great friend tho she is a online friend she is really nice and open about these types of problems i really wanted to talk to her more frequently but i am too scared of being unfriended because i kept talking to her too much.

I am getting a sense of abandonment when i think about my friends...because they don't talk to me that much anymore.

Ugh why can't i put a gun in my forehead and pull the trigger? I really am confused by all these throughts...i just remembered my cringy school years in usa..

21,"Hi guys, Im really concerned with my brothers well being and would appreciate some advice. He's been in psychosis now for around a month and is refusing to take his prescribed olanzapine as he doesn't think theres anything wrong with him. Ive chosen not to tell anyone close to me about this out of fear it will leave him ostracized, so im coming to you guys. 

Ill just give you a quick backstory. His first bout of psychosis was around 4 years ago during a stressful period in his life, which ended in being apprehended by the police and a stay in the psych ward. They put him on olanzapine and he quickly returned to his ""normal"" self, so after a year and no episodes they weened him off. He saw a psychologist for some time and often refused to accepted that anything was wrong with his mental health, so he would make excuses citing his own rational thoughts as the reason for his manic behaviour, instead of psychosis having any influence over his thoughts. Since then he's had at least 3 significant episodes, each time getting longer as he's getting more apprehensive about taking his medication, based on the fact they make him depressed, and as stated his belief that nothings wrong with him, or that all he needs to do is organize himself (thoughts) and when he does he'll never have another bout again. 

So the current episode that he's in has been the worst aside from maybe the first time. I noticed the symptoms coming on slowly but after a night out drinking for his birthday he had full blown psychosis (Ive never been afraid of my brother, hes a gentle giant, but the psychosis brings out a more violent side of him, especially when mixed with alcohol, but again he often refuses to admit that it creates any problem at all, or justifies his actions). A few days later he disappeared and a few days after filling a missing persons report we learned that he had randomly decided to tossed his phone out the window and drive 4000kms straight, with no food and no sleep, then left his car (keys on the hood) and walked 70kms, ending up on a park bench where the police found him. He ended up back in the psych ward and after a week was back home, and after a lot of convincing he agreed to take some medication, it was short lived but luckily he was making strides towards coming back down, unfortunately another night out drinking resulted in him going into full blown psychosis all over again . Side note- few months prior he started seeing a new psychiatrist, but upon his latest episode this doctor told him not to bother coming back because he wont admit theres anything wrong, he left a message for my mom saying the same thing (this left my parents furious), so he has no professional help at the moment. 

 These last few weeks have been hell, he's manic, and paranoid, and getting verbally abusive to our parents, every nights an argument. My parents and I are so distressed over his well being, his future, his job, his personal life, and we really just don't know what is the best way to help him. He adamant to move out, and gain his independence, and i want those things for him, but unless he learns to manage this (and hes showing no progress in doing so) im convinced he's going to end up either on the street, back in the psych ward, or worse. My parents and I are starting to give up on getting through to him, we really don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks. ",30Jun2017,3
22,"I am not a doctor but my friend was. I've finally gotten to a point where I can discuss this. I hate saying ""was"" instead of ""is"" and will forever feel that way. My friend was in his third year of residency when he committed suicide.

I have said that I'm not a doctor or any kind of professional in the health field so the following advice comes from the point of view of someone who has lost a friend. If you're in med school, your residency, etc. and find yourself suicidal after having sought mental help, please try to think of the things you have to live for, career alternatives, and basically anything instead of ending your life.

My friend LOVED med school but once he began his residency, he turned into a different person. During his first year, he got on an antidepressant. It helped for a year. During his second year, he attempted suicide but was stopped by attentive family members before he caused himself any harm. During this time, he took a leave of absence from his residency and they increased the dosage of his antidepressant.

Toward the end of his second year, he was feeling really good about himself and his situation and stopped taking his medication. He was back to his old self and doing very well until he had to take a board exam. While he was studying, he contacted his psychiatrist to refill his prescription. He had difficulty doing this and I don't know if he ever got the refill. He withdrew from everyone during this time. I was told by another friend that he did not do well on the exam and became very depressed.

At the beginning of his third year, he committed suicide. Throughout the entirety of his residency, there were ups and downs. During the downs, he was unhappy with his career choice and felt hopeless about his med school student loans. I don't know much more about his situation because he hated burdening friends with his issues and almost never vented to us. We have all tried to pry and encouraged him to stay on top of his prescription and appointments with mental health professionals.

If you find yourself feeling hopeless, any alternative is better than suicide. If you're in debt because of your education, there are ways to handle that. If you want to abandon this career path, there are ways to handle that. Suicide is not the answer.

I was his friend since childhood. I spoke at his funeral. I hugged his lifeless body in the casket. I saw his parents distraught. I heard my friends breakdown and cry over the phone as I broke the news to them and asked them to attend the funeral. Our friend said it best, ""He ended his suffering but began everyone else's.""

Because he was so reserved, I'll never know exactly why he did it but he did complain about long hours and a constant need to make time to study. He rarely had time to make new friends, spend time with existing friends, and was often exhausted or in a bad mood and did not feel like communicating.

Please seek help if you extremely unhappy and feel like taking your life is an option. There are so many other options to make life work instead, so many people to turn to for help, and so many people who care that you are alive.",30Jun2017,6
23,"""Don't talk about it. It will affect your life later and you won´t get some opportunitys if people will know.""

Thats what my Mother said when I told her about my social anxiety, that I have problems with myself ( I didn´t mention exactly what to her) and wanted to go to see a Therapist.

Since about 5 years ago I havent told her anything about my mental health. That I was bullied, how I got depressed because of that and wanted to kill myself.
Started to self harm and later on developed an eating dissorder, which I still can´t overcome.

She is right that it can affect my life later but so do my problems.

Does something like this happened to you? What is your opinion about this. I just want to talk about this with someone.

32,"I have a psychiatrist at my college (I graduated last year) who put some stuff in my medical records that I - and the provider I was actually seeing - disagree with. I am aware that I can add comments, but that isn't what I want to do. The tl;dr is that I think he was focusing too much on me being a weirdo goth kid and not enough on me suffering from the aftereffects of a physically and sexually abusive relationship with another student. (I am not denying that I needed mental health care; however he wrote in his records stuff about being delusional and paranoid which seem to be inaccurate, especially given the situation. My treating provider says that PTSD is a better diagnosis, and that my behavior was a fairly normal, and even rational, response to the trauma.)

The crux of my argument, however, is that this individual did not see me in an appropriate context to provide medical opinions. He functioned both as a treating psychologist and as a school administrator. In the latter capacity, he was responsible for approving or denying medical leave based on psychiatric issues, and for ensuring students remained in treatment and were able to stay on track.

I saw him only in the latter capacity. He never performed any sort of psychiatric diagnostics on me, and I did not discuss my condition with him to any significant degree beyond what was required. Additionally I am aware that much of what he said was based on third-party reports, which were often inaccurate, incomplete, or easily explainable.  Given this, I don't believe he should be qualified to add to my medical record at all.

I should give an example. I know my RA reported me to him because I refused to talk to her or tell her what was going on, even though I was clearly having difficulties. I did so because my RA was a good friend of my abuser, and I had made the choice to try to keep what happened quiet. I didn't want to deal with the drama of publicly accusing someone of abuse. But this ended up being listed as a ""symptom"", even though it's a reasonably rational choice in the aftermath of abuse.",30Jun2017,2

34,"Hi all,

I'm a 29 y/o F. Married, no kids, work full time. History of depression and insomnia. Both in remission right now.

For the past month or so, I've become very, very forgetful and I'm trying to pin down why and how to stop it. I used to remember everything. My job performance hasn't decreased, per se, but I find myself not being as efficient as I used to. And things I would remember to do, I need to set multiple reminders (phone, email, write it down), because if I only do one, I may forget still. I'm mixing up different tasks as well. Things my boss tells me one day I forget the next day. I like my job, so I don't know why I'm suddenly struggling and feeling like I'm slipping.

And this has seeped into my personal life too. I am in the process of buying a house and I keep having to go back to see what documents I sent/need to send to realtor/mortgage people, etc. I have to set a reminder to take food out of the freezer to defrost, or we won't have dinner that night. Or to take out the trash every Thursday for trash day. I use to just remember on my own. The house chores aren't getting done as frequently, because I feel like my brain is scrambled all the time.

I don't know what's wrong. It may be stress, maybe I need a vacation, I don't know. I just have no way of knowing at this point if it's permanent and I'm just going to be this way for the rest of my life. I hate this feeling because up until recently I felt so ON TOP of everything in my life.",30Jun2017,1
35,"Yesterday I went and got a beer after work. The young woman pouring my IPA had a small tattoo on her wrist. It looked like a semicolon but I was unsure. I asked her if I could get a better look at it. She said, yeah.

“You know she died,” I said.

“Who,” said the young woman, her short blond pigtails jutting from her military patrol cap.

“Amy. The woman who started ProjectSemicolon.”

“What was it? Suicide?” the young woman retorted.

“Yeah, it was.”

“What is this some kind of joke?”

“No,” I said. “I’m serious… as serious as”

“So what does this mean? Was it all a lie then?” she asked, her confusion and her anger with me building.

“No. It’s not a lie, no. It’s a part of a struggle, her lifelong struggle. It’s uh… it’s something we deal with day in and day out.”

But she wasn’t listening anymore. She walked away, gone on an extended break that lasted till I drank my pint and left.

I learned of Amy’s work when I started to see the semicolon inked on so many people. But I didn’t know Amy’s name until I read the news of her recent death on Twitter. The movement she speared to change taboos regarding the topic of suicide and how people with mental illness are treated will be seen as no less impactful as the movement Dr. King speared to change white society’s treatment of blacks; I am not overstating her influence. Amy changed the world for us with punctuation.

When I was a child in the mid 1980s the only frank mention of mental illness and self harm I can remember is the Suicidal Tendencies song, “Institutionalized.” At its crux the angry narrator’s parents tell him, “we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody and we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself, so we decided that it would be in your best interest if we put you in a place where you could get the help that you need.” Of course, that suggestion was met with no shortage of outrage because it was the parents themselves who were the source of the narrator’s anguish. I could totally relate. But that was 1985 and the only people who knew about the song were metal heads like me. Open, realistic discussions surrounding the issue didn’t start until Dan Savage started his It Gets Better campaign followed a few years later by Amy’s Project Semicolon.

Up until then if you thought about or committed suicide you were weak. You were selfish. You were an ingrate who didn’t know how good you really had it. You were taking the “easy way out.” You were the recipient of overwhelming stigmatization and so you kept your mouth shut.

Now people doubt the efficacy of the work, seeing how the most visible advocate for suicide awareness finally succumb to suicide. Her death is incredibly sad, not so much for us but for her. I know that pain but I’ve also learned the self care that will curb that pain. It is sad because Amy spent so much time engaged in the pursuit of helping others, she neglected to care for herself. She literally gave herself over to the cause, a cause that will only grow in strength and importance.

39,"Okay so I'm 15 years old part of it might be being a teenager but, I'm not sure. I feel like an empty shell and I rarely feel emotion. My so called ex ""best friend"" (ill call her N)who I had told some personal stuff told everyone in my grade about it so now, long story short a lot of people think I'm a bisexual sex-crazed chronic masturbator who is also a sjw with a short temper. The short temper thing comes from this one incident where this very much right-winged republican and this one girl who didn't like me took out there anger from a fight they had on me during lunch one day. 
So, I ended up yelling and people were staring and to make another long story short people weren't the same around me and the boys in my classes for the next month or so had started doing stuff to get me upset. And, all these memories of people bullying and saying awful things to me plays over and over in my head daily. Without fail. So, I spent that school year all alone. (This was 8th grade now I'm going into 10th.)No friends( which I was bullied for as well.) Everyday during that year I was constant dissociating and was basically selectively mute. After the lunch time incident everytime these people would insult me and say things to me and every time they did my mind would go empty and I felt like I couldn't speak. But, I didn't feel nervous as each time it happened my mind was pushed further and further to the back of my own mind. Which I think is called depersonalization. Also, my ex- ""best friend"" in the past had in my proximity that she thought I was annoying to a boy who ended up bullying me. The guy asked her why she hung out with me if she didn't like me she said she that she doesn't know she just does. For some reason this didn't process. So, I didn't react. I didn't even remember it until recently like within the past month or so. And, in the beginning of 8th grade this girl had called me the n-word ill call her C three time so I told the principal and my ""best friend"" was there and I told the assistant principal that she was there as the principal didn't bother doing any of the actual ""investigating"". So, when she asked if she heard C called me said  thing she said no even though she admitted that she heard it happen to my mother when my mom picked us up around the time this incident occurred. And, I heard these two  girls and another one who I'll call K talking about me. C was like ""how did your mom find out?"" And N said"" her mom posted it on facebook."" My Mom posted the incident on facebook and since N's and I's moms were friends in real life they were also facebook friends. So, N's Mom naturally found out and made N tell the truth. But, that didn't do anything as the principal didn't do anything. But, C was pissed and N didn't like me. So, those two paired up and spread a bunch of personal stuff about me started by N. She did say personal stuff about me in the past but, I didn't think anything of it. Like telling people about me getting my first period or my crush. I also had social difficulties like I beyond one-on-one interactions I have a hard time with social cues especially when i have too much emotional or sensory input like loud sounds. In the past I would say things and not realize how people didn't like it or me. Or how people were comfortable. So, with my social reputation destroyed and zero social skills and now a reluctance to be around people I just don't know what's wrong with me.

42,"I’m pretty much just here to vent right now. It’s been a bad couple of days, and I don’t have anyone to talk to.

I had my second session with my new therapist on Tuesday, and I was feeling pretty good and hopeful about it. I was going to meet my friends that evening to see an outdoor show, and I was really looking forward to hanging out. Instead, I got to listen to a fight between them during the entire drive there, and once we got there I found out that we were part of a group of 10-15 people. So, I ended up sitting by myself and feeling awkward.

Still, I managed to keep a positive attitude. The next day, those same friends cancelled the weekly game night they host. Okay. I had some notice from the night before (and still felt awkward about the fight), but they didn’t cancel until an hour before we are supposed to be there. I made the most of it and actually got some stuff done. Then I spoke with my dad that afternoon, and he ended up venting to me about a project we are both working on. It made me feel like I wasn’t doing good enough, even though I’m almost positive that his venting was targeted at himself.

From there, it really spiraled downward quickly. Since Wednesday afternoon, I have felt horrible. I have been feeling very hopeless, like nothing is ever going to improve, and why should it. My whole body feels heavy and weighted. The week between each therapy session feels like a month, and my time with my first therapist made everything feel so much worse and nothing improved.

I know that I just need to push through and not give up, but that doesn’t make me feel any more hopeful about the future. I’ve spent the last couple of days basically counting the hours until I can go to bed. Then, I can’t convince myself to go to bed and stay up too late. Last night I couldn’t even sleep once I went to bed, and I am exhausted right now.

Started with food poisoning, first few days, I had nausea and chills, they subsided. About a week after I had a numbing left abdominal pain that would hurt if I sat for a long time and light-headedness. Ended up in urgent care and was given antibiotics (metronidazole) and had gotten papers for a stool test. Finished first round of antibiotics and then got the stool test back and it said I was h.pylori positive. Was given the ""gold-standard"" triple therapy of two antibiotics, a PPI(omeprazole) and Pepto. Everything seemed fine until 7 days into the treatment, brain fog hits me out of nowhere. The cognitive dissociation, the lack of focus, blurred vision etc. Had to drive back up to my parent's house and have been here since because mood swings have been hysterical. Up until now, never had any sort of mental issues whatsoever. 

Its been 3 weeks since then and the fog is still here. Of course, I've researched the crap out it and have cut out all of the foods that supposedly make the fog worse. Eating clean and been taking all the supplements (i.e fish oil, turmeric, manuka honey, mastic gum for the infection, multi-vitamin and probiotic) meditation, light exercise and all that jazz. Had gotten blood work done from my gastro doc and my general care doc. Saw a neurologist and a neuropsych. Apparently, have high bilirubin levels in my liver. Waiting to get results from the MRI and Neuropsych. 

Some days it's better, other days it's terrible. No existing signs of depression or severe anxiety. Anybody you talk to can talk about how extroverted, bubbly, and outgoing I am. My job situation is fantastic. Recently had a break-up but honestly felt like I was handling it pretty well and was very vocal about my feelings with friends and family. 

This ""fog"" is just a complete contrast of who I am. I'm depressed and moody NOW because of the fog, had mild ADHD but I feel like its just become so bad. Seriously, what gives and where did this come from? I've heard about antibiotic use causing Candida, I remember having the most absurd sugar craving one day during the treatment and bought candy. Could that have contributed?

TL;DR 

Took triple therapy for h.pylori, got brain fog 7 days in with no previous sign of mental problems. Been watching my diet and doing literally everything to fight infection/brain fog but it doesn't seem to be getting better. Is this candida? What gives?",30Jun2017,2
45,"I know I need serious help, everything's been getting worse and I can't cope anymore, I'm barely holding onto being self aware. My dad doesn't believe in me having these specific issues though and doesn't seem to really understand or want to, and without any job (which I promise I'm working on) I can't afford any therapy or anything like that myself. I've thought a lot about a grand suicidal gesture but then realised I'd only be giving in, but I'm scared because I'm having those thoughts more and more often

I'm just scared of myself and I don't feel in control of anything anymore, and I'm just spiralling because of it",30Jun2017,6
