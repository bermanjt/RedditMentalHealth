0,"I've been talking to this girl for a couple of months now, if I was writing this a couple of hours ago I would go on and on about how perfect she is and how I love her so much. All of a sudden I feel like a different person who has no feelings towards her, but I do. I don't know...it's all mixed up

Yesterday I felt like my heart was racing, I couldn't stop saying all of these lovely things about a girl and how beautiful she is and how wonderful of a person she is. Today, it felt different, I would say the same things and compliment her but the smile on my face would suddenly just fade away and I feel as if my feelings have died, I would then ask my self if what I'm saying to this girl is true or not then I would get this confusing yes/no answer. Then I would go on complimenting the girl but then fearing that she would get attached to much, I want her to. Yet I'm afraid she would be hurt because of all this.

So far, what I'm afraid of...is me saying to her that I love her. I promised myself that I would wait a year before even showing her that I love her but all of a sudden I break my promise and giving her hints. As I do so, it feels as if I've fallen deep in love with her, but then I gradually feel as if I'm not any where deep in love with her

The problem is, she has a crush on someone else. That makes me very jealous. Then I would imagine her living with someone else and someone else loving her I'd get mad, jealous and sad because it feels as if I'm mentally ill...as if I can't love with out hurting her...

What should I do? Should I stop talking to her? Should I go on and love her?

We're both 20 years old",05Sep2017,0

2,"Over the past year, I started to develop symptoms of anxiety. A relationship brought out what I believe to be a form of anxiety and made it clear that it can interfere with my happiness and with my ability to have a happy relationship. To be clear I haven't been diagnosed with anything; I have not seen a professional yet. I was just wondering if you guys think I should try to use home techniques to fight what I think is anxiety or if I should just bite the bullet and see a professional. My ex-girlfriend thinks therapy would be a good idea for me, but I'm split. It feels like something that I should just be able to think away but it doesn't work. I just don't want to worry my parents by having a talk with them about treatment.

Thanks to everyone who replies, cuz it really means a lot to me. I hope everyone else that's having issues can make progress like I'm hoping to do.",05Sep2017,2
3,"please please help me. i'm 15 years old, i just got of jail and my schizophrenia (inherited from grandma) is full blown out of control. last night i was in a completely separate reality. i even hit and cussed at my step-dads mom. i was running for a good 30 minutes not knowing where i was even going. when i woke up i was in front of ampm knocked out. my step-dad had picked me up because copters found me. i didn't sleep all night because i have horrible night terrors from being peppersprayed 3 times in a row within 3 minutes. they stripped me of all my clothes and i was running around feeling my face burning off. they refused me water, milk and a shower so i sat there naked on a cold tile floor letting my face burn all the while the PO's they are standing outside my door laughing at me saying they need to re-up on their OC. I am currently deaf 2 weeks later because one pepper spray went straight into my ear canal. i wake up exactly at 3 in the morning with my bed wet from urine, and i start screaming and crying because i can still feel my face on fire. i thought i was gonna die. i cannot feel peaceful at home. i have the urge to runaway but if i do i will go back to jail. today i've been locked up in my i room and i havent left, eaten or slept in 2 days. i'm afraid to. i see the shadows following me, i hear the voices call me a slut, a whore, worthless, to kill myself, which i have attempted many times but was unsuccessful. i've been into 5 mental hospital all throughout this year. the most disturbing part is that i keep hearing footsteps outside when nobody is home, and i can hear my parents voices arguing so i am always up and down the stairs to see if anyone is there. sometimes when the voices decide to be nice i talk to them. today there have been loud police sirens in my brain like bugs. i turned my music up the loudest it could go and i still couldn't because the sirens or so loud. i couldn't even have a conversation because i couldn't hear myself speak. i am still hearing the sirens and i'm very scared because there is a voice outside banging on my door begging for my help. it's a female voice sounding like she's being tortured. i want to open my door and save her but i am afraid. please help me. my mom thinks i'm lying when all the clear evidence is there. my whole family is schizophrenic and i grew in the world with a schizophrenic grandma. as a kid, driving around the las vegas streets aimlessly listening to her talk about demons and how both of are going to hell and aliens in the sky was basically normal. i haven't been diagnosed but i am 99% positive i'm schizo. i have all the symptoms and they keep getting worse every day. i pull out my hair and rock back and forth in a corner. please help me. i don't know what to do. should i try and save the girl?",05Sep2017,16

5,"i've officially only ever been diagnosed with ADHD, but I seem.... more than that? ADHD, but with (fairly mild) sensory processing issues, with rampant perfectionism, with a tendency toward pedantry and moralistic rule following.

- sometimes when i'm tired (sleep deprived included, but its also happened when i'm just stressed or at the end of a long day), I'll ""hear things"", except they're always *real sounds*. For example, I once heard the crosswalk signal from when i was in the city center earlier that day, even though I was in the suburbs where not only was i far away from any crosswalks, but where the crosswalk signals make a different sound. it's like my thoughts can be a bit runny, so sometimes a thought or action that I already processed comes back up again. so it can also be (and i know this is a kind of ocd thing to do) use bathroom-&gt; wash hands -&gt; smell hands as i leave bathroom to make sure i don't smell like poo-&gt; they smell like soap -&gt; cool -&gt; keep walking -&gt; suddenly that 'check if they smell like poo' impulse runs again. 

- i like patterns and rhythms. When i'm feeling stressed or overloaded, i like to just go on walks and use the pattern of my footsteps as a sort of ""base pattern"", and i'll start humming and tapping out elaborations on it. music can help to, especially a lot of african/african-influenced stuff. I took an ethnomusicology class in my sophomore year of college and we talked about Fela Kuti, and i started listening to just about anything of his to... it's like i'm reimposing order on the world. like rhythms usually create a kind of grid over the world, but some things don't fit into it. But his music is more like a mesh, and just about everything (the car zooming by, the tree shadow falling over me, even my thoughts of all the things i need to get done) can fit inside that mesh. The chaos takes pattern, so instead it's just a kid of richness.

- i feel like something about me.... like people are always reacting strangely to me. I stick out to my teachers, I stick out at parties. People always tell me i act cute, or laugh at how i act. 

- I tend to snap my fingers to... ""banish""? a weird or uncomfortable thought. like if it suddenly hits me that something i did was rude, I might snap my fingers as an outlet for that suddenly jerking feeling of ""SHIT WAIT NO"".

- tbh, i'm pretty sure i also have mild OCD. I'm just better about obsessions now (I used to worry about secretly being a pedophile, for example, but I figured out the trick to that one!).

- I don't seem to be particularly good at feelings. I used to think I had massively improved me people skills and become so-fucking-
great at empathy and helping other people, but I'm starting to think I just had a skewed sample. The people I was comparing myself to were all had a bushel of diagnoses each. And I can be very socially perceptive, but i lose the skill if I don't kee

7,"I want to talk about men in today’s society, their changing role and what is expected of a man nowadays. Back in the days men were seen as society’s only driving power. It was an uneven distribution of resources and this is how the feminism movement started. It was simple – equal rights, equal treatment. But as the movement got momentum and started growing faster, it seems to me that we have started to marginalize men.

 
Before I start with my arguments as to why I think that, I want to warn you – I don’t judge people. At least I try and put all my efforts to understand, empathise and not claim I know what is right or wrong. So keep an open mind as you read this and think about the big picture.

 
I truly consider feminism as something the world needs but I also believe sometimes we take it way too far. The more you say NO to something, the stronger it grows. Just consider Newton’s third law of thermodynamics – every action has an equal and opposite reaction. For me, this means that the more hate you have for something, the more of it you will get. Feminism is something we need. We do in the lines of extraordinary situations. For example, we need those organisations that protect women from abuse. We should advocate for equal rights for women in countries in Africa and the Middle East. Feminism, however, is not what we need in our everyday lives. EVERYTHING has become “sexist” for modern day women. I have heard women saying – ""trousers are sexists because men’s trousers have deep and useful pockets while females’ don’t have that benefit"". Seriously?! What a load of crap! I have no respect for women who misuse the concept of feminism in the first place (just like misusing the term depression). How about the fact that women enter clubs with short skirts and trousers and men can only enter if they have long pants? Isn’t that discrimination too?

 
I think men and women should have equal RIGHTS and OPPORTUNITIES, not equal ROLES in society. Women have started to behave more aggressively - trying to prove they can be on their own. If you know you can, why are you trying to show it so desperately? You can be a woman and be strong without having to marginalize the other gender, without hating them, without trying to prove you are better than them! Women want gentlemen, they want manhood but yet deprive men of their masculinity. I’ve also witnessed so many girls humiliating their men in public. No one deserves that, being a man or a woman.

 
This brings me to a particular area of life, where gender inequality needs to be discussed - mental health. This is one of the biggest examples of how much more women get support compared to men. We have so many NGOs, funds, support groups and organizations for women. The fact that they exist is really great and vastly needed. According to studies: 

 
""some 10 to 15% of women will experience depression at some point in their lives—double the number of men who will. ""Women go through significant biological changes across their lifespan, more so than men, so these cyclic shifts can disrupt, malfunction, or create disease.”

 
It is true - there are huge hormonal differences (pre- and postpartum depression in women for example) and social perceptions as to role of men and women. Other studies say:

 
""the conditions most affecting women were more common than those affecting men, by a factor of 20% to 40%.”

 
This made me think! Just because men don’t share as much as women, does that mean they suffer less? It is exactly because of the society’s perception of the role of men, that men don’t share. They are supposed to be tough, to be strong, to be stable.


But what about when they are not? For me, this way of thinking is what makes men not share and suffer on their own, in the dark corner with no one to turn to because people will say they need to “man up”! They are simply not allowed to feel weak. Whereas, if you are a woman and you say you are depressed it seems more acceptable. Why is there so much less support for men than for women? A simple Google search of “women and mental health” shows you 154 million results. For men that is only 11 million. Not only that. When you search for MI in women you get as results thousands of scholarly articles. There is not a single one for men.


Did you know that men make up over 75% of suicide victims in the United States alone, with one man killing himself every 20 minutes? Or how about the fact that after divorce only about 1 in 6 men have custody of their children, often with minimal visitation rights? That can affect men sometimes as much as women. Also, mental health aid is not suited for men as well as for women. I love how they put it in this article:


""Evidence suggests that men are significantly less likely to use mental health services in response to mental health issues […] This is often attributed to stubbornness in men, rooted in traditional notions of masculinity. However, another explanation is that formal mental health services are not finely attuned to men’s needs, especially minority men. Indeed, these services tend to concentrating on medication or talk-therapy. But some research suggests that men prefer action over words in the face of stressful situations.”



All of that is not to say feminism is wrong. We need equality in all of its forms. Feminism in its core, can help shift the thinking that men are only strong and women are only weak by leveling up one to the other. The issue I have with extreme feminism is connected to being politically correct all the time. A man can’t express his masculinity - by opening a jar for a girl for example - because this has to mean he thinks she is weak? Or he can’t open a door because the girl will say: ""you disrespect me thinking I can’t open my own door?”. Showing physical strength must mean he's showing aggression and this has to mean he beats women. Why do we make it so complicated? 



Let’s be pro-HUMAN, not pro-GENDER.

9,"There was a me, there isn't now, but there was. 

I used to be able to think and process information.  To know who my family was, who I was. Parts of my memory are able to come back, but it seems to be someone else's choice as to whether or not I'll be able to. When I breathe or speak, another person, a man, echoes me, mimics me. I've seemed dead to myself internally for an unreasonably long period of time and no amount of help, practice, or patience has helped me return to who I was. I have memories of being changed as a child, knowing what my body felt like, not male, and as much as I try now to reconnect with myself, to process what has or had happened to lead me into this full removal of self, it seems I'm just farther removed, silenced more. 

I want to know who I really am, and lately strange things have been happening with my sight, like something or some persons are trying to tell me that I had existed. I haven't necessarily felt 100% of my surroundings, but I haven't felt like I'm talking either. 
Normally when we speak, there is some echo within our skulls that helps with sense of self. I don't have that. Haven't had that, and when I do experience that, it's like someone has put hearing aids or similar in me. I look into the mirror, other reflective surfaces, letters typed, numbers used, and am shown something else instead. It's like whatever has decided I should live this way won't let me be able to get the help I need. 

I may not be able to remember what I looked like in a mirror right now, but there's this feeling, this mistrust that I feel constantly stuck with when I do anything in a bathroom, in person, with my hands, anything that feels like some sense of forced compliance, like there's been a huge lie forced upon me to live with. Now, the only things I have any sort of perception with, personally, interactively, monetarily, anything, is just not me, and as much as I am willing to wait for help, for the professionals whom I've been trying to talk with about this, to help, every single time I try to get help, to not be repeated, to not be victimized, or even do something that should help, for instance reading a book, something strange happens with my body. Like whomever knows how much of an inconvenience this is isn't willing to let me get the help I know I need. 

Most days my body goes through random discomforts, like walking slowly, cautiously, aware, and being instead connecting with the arms of a bench. I know the emotional scars from this won't go away, but what about my leg?  

Sometimes I feel like there are people nearby that I cannot see, who maybe communicating with me, but are as silent to me as I am to myself. When I know where I am, trying to carry on, to secure shelter and other basic needs, I hope that these people know who I am and that the right persons will come through to help (I think at this point both medical and peacekeeping professionals are likely necessary), but nothing good happens. 

I've written down different versions of what could be reasons for why my perception is so stuck like this, and none of them wouldn't have been treated earlier, if they were really what was going on, unless there was some severe negligence on the parts of others.  I've had mri scans, of my head, of parts of my body, that something wasn't quite right would have shown up on, but maybe those doctors think I want this somehow? How about the techs?  High school alum? Fucking everyone?

Lately it's a little clearer, at least that people are responding to my existence, with the person who I I guess see in the mirror, but that doesn't help anything, hasn't helped, specifically if every time I go to brush my teeth, to wash my hands, to write something, even to type this, it seems like someone else is either pretending it is them needing help, or my perception is so limited and obfuscated that not even me knowing that this person would be speaking up for me, helping me be heard, is helping me feel better. I know that they haven't and there are likely good reasons why, but I don't understand why I've had no choice in living this way, in being able to be recognized as struggling by family, by friends, acquaintances, even being introduced!

I've tried the psychiatric route, tried getting into spiritual communities, being a regular at a coffee shop, and even just waiting outside all night, but nothing changes. He's still just the only thing I'm stuck as. Stuck being. 

I feel like there's enough evidence I could be aware of to be able to exist again, but feeling constantly terrorized, sexually or other variations on the same vein as the seemingly unimportant issue I'm writing this post about,seem to be ignored, purposefully neglected, left to rot, forgotten and alone, unwilling to reach out for help, knowing that I'll be spoken over again, that someone else will likely try to be the person needing the help or that my bodily perception of self has been changed so much from what was most real to whatever it is I've been needing to leave behind. 

If this were you, if you've had family or friends who've gone through this or similar, what would you do?  

I've tried what I can and know that it hasn't helped me any. Or at least whatever real me existed before whatever happened.",06Sep2017,2
10,"I'm not sure if this is even worth worrying about, but I was talking to a family member (70 years old) who is going through a tough time because of problems she had during her childhood. She's been told that she has a subconscious form of PTSD that she didn't even know was there for most of her life, and that's why it's so hard to deal with now.

She then went on to say that I probably have some sort of subconscious PTSD because of my mum being very sick and passing away before I was 10 years old.

Personally, I have come to peace with the fact that it happened. It was really messed up how she died, but because I was so young and had caring family members I didn't really know how horrifying it was until the past few years (I'm now 20). So I don't have those traumatic experiences that my family members had in trying to deal with this stuff, and it honestly doesn't bring me any pain at this point (I don't know if even that's a normal or heartless thing to say).

On one hand, I don't see the point in digging for things (with the help of an expensive therapist I'm guessing) that may or may not be there. On the other, I do worry about the subconscious nature of the situation and how my belief that it doesn't affect me, may not make it so.

Is there a way to figure out whether this may be a problem for me long term? Is it a relatively common problem? Are there any steps I can take now to minimise any impact it might have further on in life? ",06Sep2017,1

Not fat but I've been extremely depressed/lonely all my life and never had a reason or motivation to work out), however even ugly people can make friends. 

I  just started my 2nd semester of college after working for a year and I forgot how depressed I get when I see young people in groups or young couples, so I made a counsellors appointment for tomorrow. They usually can't do anything about my situation but they are fun to talk to sometimes. 
I find I am at my happiest when I'm alone or surrounded by miserable people or older people because they don't remind me of the life I've missed out on.

16,"Hi,

I have been depressed and taken SSRI, I'm not sure if the medicine helped or it just went away on its own. Of course I can't be 100% sure that it has gone away, but I don't feel like I did back then. When I know I was depressed I could randomly just start crying, without knowing why. I also felt sad most of the time. That is gone now, instead I feel anxious almost all the time and the SSRI medicine didn't help at all with that. I'm not on SSRI any more.

My anxiety causes some problems, despite the obvious problem that it feels shitty to never be able to relax and breathe normally. It makes it harder for me to concentrate and often my brain feels really fried and I forget things, like that I've met a person before etc. It also sometimes makes me more irritable and unpleasant to be around. But most people never notice and think I am very relaxed. I try to avoid any kind of conflict as it takes a heavy toll on me. It can be something as simple as checking my stock portfolio, opening a letter or a mail, calling someone where I have to argue my case and so on. Those things rile me up so I can't sleep for several hours when I go to bed. But in reality they do happen sometimes in a normal life, and I'm not good at handling it.

I do have some light medication I can take when I feel anxious. But it doesn't really help at all. I did get Oxascand (it's a benzodiazepine with the active ingredient oxazepam) prescribed for a while and it did take all the anxiety away immediately. It was great and such a relief, but my doctor stopped giving it to me as it is quite addictive. I do some heavy exercising twice a week, and I feel calm a while after those. Sometimes I also do some easy meditation (just focusing and counting my breaths) and that also feels good but the exercise effect lasts a bit longer.

I've gone to one session with a therapist, but I didn't get a good impression of her approach. It felt like she was experimenting and was out in deep water herself. However, it was what was included in my medical plan so when I didn't feel like she could help me everything sort of stopped in terms of a professional plan for getting me better.

My background is being bullied during childhood in combination with a mom who sometimes threatened suicide (she would say that she was about to drown herself and start walking toward the lake and I was trying to stop her). When growing up and still, I always feel like I don't belong and that I'm not liked. Even though if I use my brain I realize that is not true. Later on there were many more problems with my mom who met bad people where some abused, beat and raped her. She tried to commit suicide a couple of times. There was also alcohol problems. She is quite stable now though, however long it lasts, but I have high hopes. At the same time my biological dad (I grew up with my stepdad) got terminally ill. We didn't meet so often during my childhood and didn't have the relationship I think we both wanted, until at the end before he passed away. It was really hard seeing him fade away over three years and realize how scared he was. I do miss him a lot and wish that we would have gotten close earlier when he was still healthy. The condition he had is part hereditary and there is a fifty fifty risk I get it too, which is something that's hard not to think about sometimes.

I thought I would try to find a good therapist or shrink to talk to and pay for that myself. What do you suggest I should look for in one that might be able to help me? And do you have any other advice?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. All the best to you!

19,"Dear doctors, 

I've been having lots of trouble with my mind. I'd like to put in that I'm under eighteen, female. I am from a middle class family. My parents do fight a lot, but only when my mother is drunk. My maternal grandmother has depression and my mother has bipolar. My brother sometimes physically hurts me, but not very seriously. He also causes a rift between my parents, my mother protecting him and my father trying to teach him a lesson, which is one of the major reasons for their arguments. Additionally, I have just gone through a traumatizing breakup of a friendship, as well as a breakup from my friend who 'supported' me. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety. I have trouble staying still and I'm always bouncing around or fidgeting. I am under lots of stress from school, which caused general anxiety. I used to cut myself but now I don't and whenever I feel the urge I resist. It is the same with suicidal thoughts. The thoughts were there at the beginning, but left, but now they have come back thanks to the arguments and my broken friendships. Luckily I manage to ignore them.

Last year, I used to 'see' things in the shadows and I ended up crying a couple nights. I am unable to understand people and their emotions very well. Normally I'm in a great mood but sometimes when even the smallest thing happens that affects me I can end up crying for hours. One thing that particularly grinds my gears is 'fakeness', when someone is what they aren't and so on. My reaction to 'fakeness' can be extreme, ranging from unable to breathe to fidgeting a lot. After crying or being depressed, I get various physical symptoms. They include: a lot of anxiety, lightheadedness*, dizziness*, 'pins and needles' in my brain* (which can make me fall down), the black and white TV static that you see come across my vision*, inability to breathe, dry coughing that increases the nausea, an inability to think*, and an increased chance of 'seeing' things during the night. I stay awake until two a.m. or so, but when I do sleep I can sleep for twelve hours. Naturally I only sleep that long on the weekends, so I usually go throughout the day with a lack of sleep.

It's been a year and a half if I remember correctly.
I have taken lots of different medicines for people who thought I have asthma etc.  However I have not taken anything for anxiety or anything like that in particular.

I've gone to a therapist (who diagnosed me with anxiety) but she made me fall to pieces and after that I lost most of my trust in them. Coupled with my breaking of friendship I now have trouble trusting people, especially online. Actually, that is why I am using a throwaway account right now.

This is why I want my first diagnosis from an online community, and to know if it is serious or not. (Of course it is serious but I am doing pretty well holding up by myself right now.) I have trouble opening up in real life which is why I want to avoid doctors at all cause. Thank you for your time.

*This usually intensifies when I try standing up and walking, especially suddenly.

Edit: I've been having fuzziness of the mind constantly now. I can look at people objectively whenever I'm not face to face with them (online etc) but when its face to face it's hard. I have random spikes of interest in what I am doing.",06Sep2017,2

22,"This is a throwaway. I'm a 19 year old guy, come from an upper class background, and have had an all around pretty average life. However, the past couple years as I've entered high school and college I feel like I've strayed on some path that's going to wind up with me completely off the deep end. This is probably going to be a long post, and even if I don't get much advice I think it's necessary to get everything I need to say out somewhere.

I've always been a quiet kid. Quiet, but not socially inept. I was homeschooled through elementary school, due to my Mom's ""alternative"" kind of parenting that I initially resented her for but now appreciate the homeschool experience I got to have as a kid. I was surrounded by lots of kids my age at a young age, and have been blessed to have good friends most of my life. Like I said, my parents are fairly well off and my sister (17) and I, have been given everything.

I've always considered myself smart, but lacking common sense. I'm the type of person who fails at explaining anything properly but excels at school. I've gotten good grades all through public school, and have a high GPA in college. Throughout my childhood I was definitely given a lot of (somewhat undeserved) praise, and I think it went to my head.

This is all just backstory to my main point. I started college last fall after doing running start my senior year of high school. Up until this point, I never did much introspection beyond knowing I was a little weird but capable person. College was a disaster for me as I felt completely isolated and failed to make any meaningful connections.

College was also a wake up call that made me realize I'm fucking crazy. It also made me realize some of my behavior comes directly from my parents, but they entirely to blame. For one, I can't stand people. On the outside, I can understand the idea of wanting to interact with people, but when it comes down to it, I (like my father) have a hard time relating to anyone. I don't emote properly, everything I do is calculated. When I laugh around people, I'm forcing it. When I smile, it's an act. I'm really condescending. I like seeing weakness in people, other people's failure makes me feel good, etc, etc. All awful stuff, but stuff I see plain as day in my dad. I used to almost act like him exactly, but the past year I've tried to steer away from that behavior if it's even possible

When I was at college I was hospitalized over the fear that I might be a sociopath. Of course, nothing came of this except me leaving the college I was attending after the first semester and going back home. I started to see a therapist I had seen occasionally in middle school for different reasons relating to anger management. He dismissed my claims and I finally closed the chapter in that book. What I was diagnosed with was depression; which made complete sense in hindsight. My doctor specially identified it as dysthymia. 

Still, I didn't feel depression covered it. Sometime later I began to consider the fact that I may have autism, or aspergers at the very least. This led to full on paranoia where I accused my mom of hiding this secret from me to protect me. My mom is a smart woman but holds some questionable beliefs relating to vaccines, something that made me suspicious she had started to believe this as a result of me being diagnosed with autism at a young age. She was hurt by this but the fact she may be ""protecting my feelings"" somehow is something I can't, to this day, get rid of entirely. I relate to a lot of things on the autism spectrum, but can't say for myself whether I truly believe I'm autistic.

That led me to take a bunch of mental disorder tests where I scored highly on depression (no surprise) and *bipolar disorder* something I had looked into before but dismissed. Now, as I've looked into more recently and reexamine some of my behavior I'm considering it might be perfectly reasonable. The depression part of the disorder is clean, and the mania is apparent as I do have extreme periods of (unearned) happiness. I can be extremely
Social at some points and talkative despite being *very* introverted (although I've questioned whether I'm truly introverted or just a socially impaired extrovert at times as well).

I understand this comes across as me being a bit of hypochondriac, but what it really boils down to is *something* is going on upstairs that I can't explain. I don't feel like other people, I don't have the same drive to fit in socially or pursue a romantic relationship (at least not unselfishly). Everything I do is an elaborate show, and when I'm being myself I feel nothing at all. I need resolution. I need some answer to this, or at least some advice. Sorry for the novel. I'm paranoid as fuck everyone knows something about me that I don't. That I'm oblivious to the fact I've always been a weirdo. That my parents, my sister, my friends have been putting on a show to convince me I'm normal, and only now, nearing my twenties, am I figuring out the truth. I would talk to my therapist but I feel I've exhausted this topic with him, and I also don't feel entirely comfortable with him either.",06Sep2017,3

I have extreme brain zaps which are causing me to be in bed all the time. I can't walk sometimes from these electrical jolts. I'm fed up, I really am.

26,"First of all, I live in Saudi Arabia. An awful country for people with mental issues (homosexuals being classified as mentally insane, basic ADHD medications are mostly banned, etc)

This started with me as a kid, maybe 6 or 7. I used to go to my parent's living room, lock the door, and run from wall to wall, doing specific things like bumping on a corner or something like that. Over time my exercises became more and more intense, and over the years I have had to change my exercise methods to help me better conceal the very loud noise coming from my room (jumping to bed, jumping on top of a surface, etc). During the exercises I imagine things. Such as my view of the world, a dream coming true, and so on. The exercise sessions are spontaneous and easily triggered, interactions with people, things as simple as watching a few minutes of a movie will feed my imagination and fuel a massive urge to do these exercises which I do on average 4-15 times a day (as result I am a very thin person, 40 kilograms at 172 cm)

My record of suppressing my urge to do these exercises was 3 days as far as I remember. I'm not a solitary person by nature but have to isolate myself because I don't live in a good society. At high school I was very social and had many friends, weather I am socially active or not my exercise activities never stopped or slowed down. For a long time I self-diagnosed myself as having OCD (my family has history of OCD), but I'm not really sure if this is OCD.

Is this familiar to any of you?",06Sep2017,3

41,"4 years ago I (25m) was as much of a mess as anyone. Formally diagnosed with BPD, Cyclothymia and ASD, I all but gave up. When I realized that doing so got me nowhere towards any positive goals, I decided to change. Long story short, I sucked it up and mustered all the strength and courage I could to climb out inch by inch, day by day. So far I have gone from jobless, not in school, nearly homeless with no ambitions whatsoever and transformed myself into someone who holds a part time job, is taking care of himself and is keeping a 3.5 GPA in engineering at a respectable University. It all sounds so good when I say it like that but believe me, it was more painful and difficult to get to this point than anything I have ever done in my life. I did the only thing I could in order to get to where I am and that is to push down the things I was feeling at the time and put up walls so no one, even myself, could see the demons inside. The sad thing is I know they're still there. Still so many experiences and emotions that I will one day have to work through. I suppose what I am looking for is someone with a similar situation to mine. Someone who is actively doing their best to improve themselves and just needs an extra ear to vent to. I am a good listener, but I simply don't have anyone to talk to who would understand quite what I am going through. I long for someone to be able to message at least more than once a week that can help me out and allow me to return the favor. I still have hope that I can do this and make something of myself one day, I just need some positive support along the way... Feel free to PM me if you see yourself in a similar situation. I could really use the human contact right now as all of the friends I have made through school clubs and extracurriculars are blowing me off right now and it has me very upset.",06Sep2017,9

43,"Hello all, this is a difficult thing to share, scary but exciting to get it off my chest. I hope it finds you in a good place, and if not, I hope you can glean something new in relation to your own experience and perspective on this truly terrible mental disorder. 

One year ago, after doing much personal research into something that sounded exactly like me, I was diagnosed as having Bipolar Disorder 1. Part of my research was here on Reddit, but I found that it was mostly subjective experiences and self-diagnosing. Although helpful to get a grasp of and understand other people’s trials and tribulations, I did a lot more research on my own. 

—————

As a 25 year old, I truly did not believe I would live to see 26, let alone 27. I woke up daily seeing my metal clothing rod above my bed as a means to an end. Nine months ago I became properly medicated after much professional counseling and psychiatric help.

Today is the first day in ten years that I've looked at my own reflection with a sense of self-respect, love and confidence.

This last week has been the most intensely terrifying and upsetting manic episode since my first one as a 16 year old. Beginning the day after my birthday, I experienced the worst of the worst, the whole gamut of my mental and emotional extremes in the span of five days and nights. I lost control of my thoughts and actions and became a flight risk, positive that I was part of some grand scheme put together by my friends to surprise me for my birthday. If you have seen the movie The Game, it was similar in that I thought around every corner I’d discover some kind of clue and wind up being brought into a grand banquet of all my loved ones. In reality, I was running around, scaring my people at 2am, loud and obnoxious, selfishly pursuing a grandiose delusion. 

I had a scheduled check up with my Doc yesterday in which my incredibly supportive life partner, Hannah, accompanied me. I felt loved, supported, heard, felt, and (mostly) sane ￼:)

After much rest, lots of food and water, and some solid exercise, I feel back to a neutral and healthy baseline and finally, finally comfortable sharing this with those outside my most intimate circle of people. I also want to note that in all three of my manic episodes, I had been smoking weed. I’m now convinced that it is not wise to get high when you know you are prone to mania and depression. It is a medicine, but my personal advice is don’t use it as one when you haven’t been given a prescription. There are plenty of meds out there that will keep you close to your baseline and are very effective. I have been taking Lamotrigine (150mg), an anti-seizure medication similar to Lithium, and Citalopram (20mg), a mild antidepressant, daily for about six months after finding what worked best for me alongside my Psychiatrist and Mental Health Counselor. 

Per usual when discussing Bipolar Disorder 1, I like to include the diagnostic symptoms in order to educate and also provide a synopsis for those who are tempted to self diagnose, or maybe who are searching for answers just like I had been. 

Bipolar I disorder requires symptoms to meet the full criteria for what is known as a manic episode. You do not have to experience depression to be diagnosed with Bipolar I, but many people with the diagnosis experience both kinds of mood episodes.

A manic episode must include at least three of the following symptoms:  
	• increased talkativeness 
	• increased self-esteem or grandiosity 
	• decreased need for sleep 
	• increase in goal-direct activity, energy level, or irritability 
	• racing thoughts 
	• poor attention 
	• increased risk-taking (spending money, risky sexual behaviors, etc.)

44,"For the past 3+ months I've been obsessed with being placed in a ""mental rehabilitation ward"" that it's what I've accepted as the way forward in my treatment. 

Because tomorrow is my first appointment with my Care Coordinator in 2 months (her timekeeping is 👌🏻), I've kind of accepted it in my head as 'the day stuff finally gets done and I get out of this house' even though I *know* it's not, it's a meeting to discuss what the team said about DBT - and I haven't even *mentioned* to anybody that I think a psych hold would be a good idea so it's not even in the table. 

I've been so preoccupied with it that I've made lists of things I'd need, been daydreaming about what it would be like, have had to bite my tongue whenever anyone suggests something after Thursday so I don't go ""I won't be here"". I *know* that's not true. I just can't get it out of my head that this is what's happening/needs to happen. 

How can I focus on DBT (which I know needs a lot of effort and an actual wish to stop self harming in my case) when I'm living in this fantasy world where inpatient is the only answer and everything else is simply passing the time until it happens? Any steps my cpn has set me have completely gone out of my head because, to me, they don't matter and aren't part of my *actual* care plan, that exists solely in my head. How are things happening in the real world supposed to affect me when I don't live in the real world? It's really slowing my progress when I don't listen to anything anyone says because it's not what I want to hear.

45,"All my life I've felt so empty.
I've been suicidal since I was 6 but I've only attempted once.

The slightest thing sets me off.
I'm paranoid and depressed and I'm just lying here in the dark leaking (not crying but my eyes are making tears) and I just hate the world.

I don't want to exist. I don't want to read into every detail of every message because my boyfriend may or may not be faithful and frankly it doesn't matter. If he is ill accuse him of it anyway until he gives up or I find out I was right further strengthening my paranoia.

I got demoted for shit that wasn't my fault so now I hate my job.

I still live at home and give them half my income cause they can't(won't) support themselves or just don't want me to leave.

The only thing that makes me feel better is eating but I'm pushing to pre-diabetic and need to stop. 
I'm trying to loose weight and I'm strict with my calories and go to the gym it the stress from nonexistent bullshit is holding me back.

I just can't. 
I'm not progressing. I'm not moving forward. I'm just stuck.

I'm stuck as a little girl lonely and sad. 
I'm stuck as a teenager, bullied and ostracised for no reason other than they just decided.
I'm stuck as a young adult because I can't save up and spend my life at work making everyone else money while my life just passes me by.

I honestly want to die.
I don't want to live like this and I'm sick of being told it will get better because better is only temporary.
Better is while I distract myself from reality with everything I can and never stop.

It's been 20 years of misery.
But the guilt of ending my own life... of ruining my best friends wedding... of potentially ruining a good man... of leaving my only relative on her own...

I am not my own life. My life is not mine to take it would seem.
