1,"So I've heard of some people going off all their meds(tapering, not just completely) in order to start over and see if something else works.
I've been on the same meds for years, since I was about 15. I'm thinking now my brain might be different at 19, so maybe something else would work better? 

Have any of you done this? It's seems risky, especially for me considering my history. A suicide attempt, and mixed manic episodes that make me very impulsive. But I'm not doing well at all. I can't remember when the last time I went outside was. Thoughts?",06Jul2017,1

3,"I've been looking and looking and not finding anything. Part of the problem is that search engines turn up a lot on the treatment of abuse survivors in general, and not on specifically survivors of this sort of abuse. I'm looking for solid research or discussion that goes beyond anecdotes, particularly on further interaction with the mental health system, and especially on how treatment works for these individuals. I've honestly never even met a professional who had any idea on the topic (and I've dealt with a lot). 

I'm also trying to stay away from blatant anti-psychiatry sites. I accept criticism, even severe criticism, of the mental health system. I don't go along with people who say it's all bunk. 

Is there even anything out there?  I've found some scattered blogs and stories, but really nothing else.",06Jul2017,6

7,"I thought this would be an appropriate place to suggest a coping mechanism that I had been using for a while.

I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, Cluster A and B personality disorders, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I dissociate, have black outs, nightmares and sometimes night terrors. I also have flashbacks and frequent (as well as disturbing) hallucinations. And through frustration of addressing problems that people (including some family) do not understand or deny completely, I tend to suppress a lot of anger which often leads to emotional spill-overs, arguments, and fights.

So my favorite way (and the most effective for me) is writing continuously in The Book of Salt.

What it is is basically a journal where I write down exactly what was said and/or done to me in exact quotes and responding to them by insulting their wording, their points of view, and everything about them that I can think of.

So journaling, but instead of writing down the good and bad things that happened, I vent my anger through pen and paper, close the book, and store it away for another time.

It makes me feel powerful while also keeping my worst side of me at bay. It builds my confidence and keeps me from going off at people online and in person. Just knowing what I'm capable is enough for me to think twice and save my angry comments for The Book of Salt.

Though, sometimes I slip up and engage in things but I try to stop by cutting the argument short (not engaging) or by picking apart their arguments and drawing my own conclusions. Then again, I save the rest of my argument for The Book of Salt.

I would like honest opinions as well from all of you on what you think. Does it sound like a good idea to you or should I possibly pursue other means of venting my anger? Otherwise if there are people willing to try it, I would highly suggest it!",06Jul2017,3
8,"Hello guys, I'm writing to you in hope someone would enlighten me. I've been experienced this weird feeling for 10+ years and if I'm writing these lines right now, it's because it happened again 10 minutes ago.

I suddenly felt like I wasn't myself. I'm not talking about a sudden realization about a change in my values, I actually literally mean it. I felt like I was someone else put in that body and I had no recollection of ""who"" I actually am. I browsed my brain trying to find a hint to rationalize, but obviously, I can't recall the life of ""that someone"". It's purely an identity issue, I still had my memories. It happens twice a month I'd say. In these situation, I immediately force myself to ground myself back to reality (usually I go online to read something random) because if I do not, I'm overtaken by panic (which is an understandable reaction given the situation I think). Generally it goes away after 2 minutes not thinking about it.

The first time it happened, I was 11 y/o. I was walking by a mirror and looked into it. Then it ""hit me"": ""This is not me. This is NOT me! I don't look like that!"". Afterwards, I had a major panic attack.

I already looked up the phenomenon years ago and concluded it was depersonalization out of anxiety or something along those lines. But I just looked it up again, and DPD isn't exactly that. The description i read about DPD is about feeling out of one's body and feeling in a dream. I experience the latter very often, and it went to such extent sometimes I wonder if I'm not actually dead/in a coma/dreaming and I'm reliving a cycle of my life endlessly with mild changes my subconscious imagines to trick me (yeah that's fucked up, I'm conscious of it). Also, sometimes my auto-pilote mode goes way too far and I can't recall the last 5 minutes.

This post isn't a cry for help, I'm handling this issue well, I never got in any trouble because of it and my life is doing fine. I'm just curious. Is that a hint for a dissociative disorder? Is there a name for this phenomenon?

And I won't ask ""am I the only one?"" because we're never the ""only one"" in anything.",06Jul2017,1

14,"I live in Canada.

I had been with the company for about 10 months and I have had these recurring episodes of blurred vision, seeing black dots/tunnel vision and feeling like i'm going to faint/fall over. Sometimes it's triggered by lighting, more so fluorescent lighting. 

I've gone to emergency numerous times, I always got a doctors note. My ophthalmologist thinks it's ocular migraines my doctor isn't sure but i've been told it may be anxiety attacks. I'm waiting on a CT scan, to see a neurologist and a psychiatrist (for other issues, such as having testing for aspergers)

I'm super sensitive to light and certain things set me off. I had started crying at work almost every shift and I just couldn't handle it. My employer purposely manipulated me and it turned in to a game of cat and mouse. I had an inkling that my manager didn't really like me because I had to communicate with HR a lot. Finally, I was brought in on a day off and was told they had to let me go. I thought all my absences were approved. I had asked for meetings and instructions in writing because every time my manager brought me in to her office, my heart was beating so loud, I couldn't even focus on what she was saying.

I can't stop replaying it in my head, it's already hot enough here and i don't know if it's causing me night sweats, or what.. but i've been staying in bed for nearly the whole day for the past few days. I can't bring myself to do much.",06Jul2017,3

17,"Title. This is going to be long...

A long time ago, I broke up with the person I believed to be the love of my life. They taught me a lot of things, held me day by day, listened to me. We talked every day, endlessly. We rambled to each other on and on. We supported each other. We loved each other like we didn't love anyone. Until it all fell down, and it went up in flames. Abuse, drinking, a lot of tears and miscommunication.

For a long while, nothing felt right. As more time passed, I went on to change like I had started to do at the end of our relationship. Apathy set in. Slowly, but surely, I was disconnecting from reality further and further. I have always suffered from depersonalization and anxiety, but things got much worse. But I went on. When things felt 'okay', I entered into another relationship No sweat.

I was delightfully happy with how things had turned out. Or so I thought. A part in the back of my mind was furious -- angry. I feel like I had become some sort of monster that barely felt anything, no empathy, no caring, no worry, and yet I was content with that.

But something happened. Months ago I started having huge panic attacks, constant anxiety through the day and my derealization and depersonalization shot so much through the roof that I started to wonder if I was going insane.

I got checked in with psychiatrists. First I was administered anti-psychotics by my first psychiatrist under the belief I was suffering from psychosis. I ended up at the ER from how bad it went, where I was given a benzo and told I appeared to suffer many symptoms of OCD. I was sent to a special unit and am now being seen by a psychiatrist who thinks I have autism and not OCD for some reason. w/e.

However, I was put on an anti-depressant. Celexa to be exact. And from there, things started to change.

The first few weeks, something felt odd, but not in a bad way. I felt my anxiety spike, but I was covered by the benzo. Soon a month would come to pass, my depersonalization, anxiety and obsessive thinking slowed down majorly, and then -- I don't know when it started, but I felt something.

When I began to 'go back into reality', my feelings began to come back. My worries, my caring, my fears. And then, grief, mourning. One day I woke up and it hit me -- that I had lost my life, and I thought of my ex. I broke down. Instead of feeling emptiness and anger, I started to be feel an overwhelming sadness that seemed to be hidden all this time. And god, I keep thinking of him and his smile, our indescribable bond, and how I have thought that I have felt everything there is.

I have been trying to find information regarding this phenomenon and anti-depressants only to find bits about anti-depressants dulling emotions (which is the opposite of what happened to me) 

I suppose a simple answer is that I was depressed and I repressed myself to cope, but I do wonder... and yearn for what I had.",06Jul2017,1

I'm volunteering with an organization where we are allowed to make our own projects, with no funding of course :) AAAAnywho I want to make a **sustainable** project where we talk/learn about mental health. I thought about creating a discussion group first and then see where it's going, and then maybe try to create a project but I don't know how to attract people since it's not a commonly talked about subject in the community and there is still stigmas about it.

Is there any advice that you can give ? You can think of this as a brainstorming session. ",06Jul2017,2
21,"I was wondering if anyone has experienced this?

My story is as follows...

I have had supra ventricular tachycardia all my life. Attacks have decreased over time, however when I was 17 years old I was diagnosed with anxiety due to this health issue. For those not in the know and to save you googling SVT is an electrical issue with your heart where it will randomly start beating extremely fast, approximately 250 BPM. Having this constant worry that I was going to have an attack and basically drop dead lead to my anxiety. I was having panic attacks, the usual symptoms of couldn't catch a breath etc.

The doctor prescribed 30mg of paxil and soon I was absolutely fine. Cut to 8 years later and I decided to come off it. I had horrendous withdrawals but stayed off it for 2 years trying a couple of other drugs. At this time though, about 10yrs ago I went back to the doc and told him I had to go back on it. Life was really grim for those 2 years. I told him I had come to terms with the fact I would need to be on it for the rest of my life.

I started on 20mg, cut down to 10 for the last 3 or 4 years. Through this period I had lived with and split with my partner and been in some pretty stressful situations at work but I was 100% panic free.

A year ago ( I am now 37) I got the opportunity for progression at work and jumped at it. It would be a year of study and exams - I knew it would be extremely stressful but it didn't phase me. I have one exam left to pass at the end of July.

However... At the start of may I had the fog of depression and anxiety returning. I assumed it was exam stress and got through it. However it seemed to be getting worse. I returned to the doc and upped to 20 mg. I had a tachacardia attack a couple of weeks ago, the first since 2011. I am now feeling back to how bad I was originally with panic etc. It feels like the drug is no longer working at all. Is this possible? 20 years almost of feeling normal and within 2 months I'm back to square one? Has anyone experienced this or have any suggestions?

Tl:Dr been on paxil for 20 years and felt fine. Suddenly feels like it no longer has any effect.

Thanks in advance all. ",06Jul2017,1

31,"I have no idea what’s going on with me and I’m hoping someone can point me in the right direction… or maybe someone else has a similar issue and can help me put better words to it. 

I’m not even remotely sure how to explain this, but I’ll try: I have been getting a really strong sensation of death and decomposition (?) in situations that have absolutely nothing to do with death. Like, I will be reading about a player trade in the MLB and I’ll suddenly get the feeling that something near me is dead. (That’s not even entirely the right way to describe this, argh.) Or I’ll be talking about gay rights, or kittens, or macaroni and cheese, and I get a “something is dying” sensation. 

It happened for the first time a few months ago when I was on a true crime kick (unsolved murders, wrongful convictions, etc), so I figured it was likely related to the amount of true crime material I was consuming. I cut all of my true crime podcasts and books and the sensation stopped, so I figured it must have been related to that.

But now it’s happening again, and I can’t think of a possible trigger or reason WHY, and it’s happening ALL THE TIME. I'm dealing with this sensation more often than I'm NOT feeling it, and I have no idea how to make it stop.

I haven’t been having suicidal thoughts. I do acknowledge that I have been struggling with depression lately and some slight anxiety (which I partially attribute to having gone through a very, very bad breakup at the end of last year), but I’ve dealt with depression several times throughout my life and it’s never been like this. 

This is really really weird, and it's really starting to get to me. I'm planning on seeing a doctor within the next couple of weeks, but I'm kinda hoping someone else has been through something similar and will be able to help me explain the sensation I'm getting... ? 

EDIT: I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just hoping somebody else will be able to help me explain what the issue is when I try to explain this to a doctor. O_o

I genuinely love her so much, she has helped me through issues of my own and she makes me a better person. We want to spend the rest of our lives together.
 Luckily with a family mental health history, I'm better at dealing with her issue than most people would be, but that doesn't mean it's still not difficult. Somethings will just cause her to snap and at that point it's hard to reason with her, later she'll regret it all and hate herself for it and attempt self harm; which I'm usually able to prevent but it has been difficult.
There are times she can be incredibly hard to deal with, she has a habit of saying really harsh things that she doesn't mean and really closing herself of to me. I'd just love to know if there are ways to deal with her issues better so that they are at least less likely to keep happening. I know I can never truly prevent it but I can at least try to help her control it better. Any advice?

40,"I'll preface this by saying that I don't really know anything about these subjects, and I'm sorry I've just rambled. towards the end I've just typed out my train of thoughts.

When I read about thing like Bipolar disorder, narcissistic personality disorder and anti-social personality disorder, I relate to too much of what I read.

to give a few notes; 

* I was always a pain in the ass as a kid. I thought I was the class clown, but in hindsight I think I was more of a ""bully"". I hate the word but that's what it is. I was a short and skinny kid though, so my bark was always bigger than my bite but I sure did bark a hell of a lot.

* I tried to cut my wrist with scizzors in grade 5 - I can't remember why. But I barely broke the skin (safety scizzors for kids thank god) and thought it was a dumb move afterwards. I had suicidal thoughts before this or I'd think of running away. I remember reminding myself that suicide was stupid, everything I know, good or bad, has been in this existence.. so it didnt make sense to end it. I'm not explaining myself well, the anology I'd like to use is that my life was a movie, and I had two options, to keep watching the shitty movie or to turn it off and stare at a black screen. I remember thinking I'd never get to eat a strawberry again.

I'm so close to deleting this right now because I feel like most people will think this is just a shitpost. I can't do anything but assure you that this is a serious post, and I want to answer any questions you probably are going to have.

* grade 5 teacher told me on at least two different occasions that I had anger management issues and my grade 6 teacher, who also taught me in grade 2, once said ""you can really hold a grudge, cant you?"" I dont remember the context.

* Throughout primary school I was almost always among the ""smartest"" kids in the class. I viewed the smarted person as my rival.. I was always trying to out do her. her and I and another kid were the three selected from our class to join an education extension program. I was accepted into one of the top high schools in the city, but for whatever reason didnt go. I wanted to go to the same high school as my friends were going to but it was near a shopping centre and my parents thought I'd start stealing stuff.. I'd be passing through there 5 days a week an it was bound to happen at some point, i guess.. the kicker is though that i have never stolen anything.

* I genuinely thought I was god. I'd think about existence a lot as a child. how can i explain this.. God is the decisioner (or so i was taught). I used to envision it as if god was playing the Sims, or with lego men. But if god was the decisioner, I wouldnt have free will. And I definitely had free will, so because i was in control of myself (i guess, now i think about it and try to explain it) I thought I was god... I realized at the time that the freewill + god thing was a bit of a paradox. I dont know how long it lasted, but it was definitely gone by the time i hit high school.

honestly, I dont want to type anymore. I've vented, its 4:30am, I'm in a better mood and I'm tired. Just slowing my head down and focusing on something for 30 minutes was nice.. maybe i just needed some stimulation. I was considering deleting this because I've really just rambled and this kind of has turned into a shit post but im going to post it because I have no friends and crave that validation of my thoughts.. last note, as it sort of segways, I remember being with my girlfriend when i was about 15/16 and thinking that I don't really feel emotion.. i started smoking weed around that time. and from year 10 to year 12 I changed a fair bit. I was feeling empathy for my teachers, and stopped giving them such a hard time... i dont know what im getting at exactly. for years i felt like weed was helping me, but now its obviously a hindrance - but I didnt want this post to include anything about that, because I still feel it helped me grow as a person, but now the momentums shifted and its messing with my head a bit. Actually, now I remember that I initially started with the fucked up things from primary school to try and prove that I was already a bit fucked up before. One other thing I want to point out is that I never really felt like a victim of anything.. I never felt like I was bullied.. the whole bullying concept just seemed dumb to me, it still kind of does. We're all just monkeys, and ""bullying"", especially among children is just us monkeys establishing a hierarchy. atleast thats my take on it. Anyways, I have skipped over the point I was going to make. I still have a hard time knowing how im feeling emotionally and why. Often I'll only realize I feel a certain way because I have song lyrics repeating in my head, and I think, oh yeah thats right, im probably feeling x about y. sometimes I'm skipping between different lines in different songs.

like right now i have this; ""..and I know it sounds defeatist. but that would mean i would be sick of this... and thats impossible.""

and this

""we're all fucked on weed, and LSD, and hailing things. Our loves for keeps, and I swear, I'd take anything if it helps me clear my head.""

I want help, I cant afford help, I dont want any medication of any variety.. I'm scared I'd say too much to a professional and end up locked in a mental institute, and I cant think of anything worse. Now im thinking about it, it may just come back to the fact that I cant/dont/wont trust anyone.. but I want to talk about my experiences and my thoughts.. heres a lyric that just came to mind.

""please please validate me, im out on a limb here"". and I guess that is exactly how I feel.

I just want to also mention that I havnt considered suicide for months. My heads just plagued with bullshit.

sorry for the ramble. its now 2 minutes to 5 and I'm going to stop typing now. im sure this was a pain in the ass to read. kudos to you if you got through it.
