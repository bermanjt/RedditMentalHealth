0,"Hi there, I was wondering what you guys advise on sudden, unexpected bouts of having no motivation whatsoever. I had such a moment when I came back from work last night and I was hoping to workout, tidy up and read. I ended up feeling so 'out of it' I stayed in bed for an extra couple of hours. 

I tried to snap out of it by looking up pep talks on youtube which helped a little but eventually I had the luck to just crawl out of bed and I felt a little bit better but didn't really get anything beyond eating done. 

I was wondering if this ever happens to anyone and what do you do when it does? ",13Mar2017,1

3,"It seems to happen to me.  If I sleep too long, say to 9:30 in the morning, with a lot of dreams, my rumination level during the day will increase a lot.  Then anxiety is back. 

On the contrary, if I don't sleep enough, I will feel tired but the rumination level can be lower. ",13Mar2017,1

5,"I'm on Fluoxac since last october. My depression comes and goes, but it never stops. Sometimes it hits hard, sometimes it doesn't. The thing is, I've been thinking about murder and pain a lot since last week. I've been fantasizing about killing someone I know, and I have nobody I trust to ask them this. It's been a tough week and I notice I'm blaming a lot of people of what happens to me but I can't get rid of the thought of having some kind of ""vengeance"" or ""absolution"" when I know I'm just trying to justify my crave.

I've also noticed I can ease the crave by looking at violent photos and footage of murder. I'm starting to get scared. i don't know if I can even trust myself.

What could it be?",14Mar2017,1

7,"I posted a reddit about this earlier but unfortunately lost my password for it so please excuse a double post. I was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and I'm considering suicide. This isn't a cry for help, a means to get attention, nor a condoning of the act, although borderlines are known for attention seeking. I want a personal opinion on whether or not you believe this is the ethical decision. I have been the primary source of my families dysfunction for the past few years, I would make an almost weekly suicide threat, and have recently turned to drugs. My parents, sister, and best friend are all pretty worried. I don't want them to worry, but I honestly and truly believe that they would be better off without me. My sister has crippling anxiety, so losing her primary stressor would relieve a great deal of that. My parents are going through financial hardship, so no longer need to pay for a second child's college should assist in that regard. Moving on to why the way I am, growing up I always viewed myself as the type of person who is filtered out during natural selection. I described myself as a defective product that needs to be removed from the assembly line. However, with this new diagnosis, it seems more like I should be putting down Old Yeller. Borderlines are generally viewed as abusive and unstable. All my relationships have ended in disaster. BPD's are essentially incapable of long-lasting relationships, so a family of my own is impossible. I will only be happy if I am loved so I need a family, my parents are quite old and won't last forever. I also display very manipulative tendencies. I have a romantic inclination toward my best friend. BPDs are defined by having and unimaginable fear of abandonment, I would often threaten suicide if I even remotely feared she would leave me. Her father left her so she doesn't want to give me the same fate, but I see I am taking my toll on her. But if I can so easily manipulate the one I love the most, perhaps I deserve to die. I can feel empathy for others so I know I'm not a sociopath, but I feel emotions on a rare occurrence. I only feel them when I can no longer control them due to intensity. So a life lived without love, hardly any feelings, and being a burden on my loved ones does not seem to be an ethical life. I want someone's two cents on whether or not I should go through with suicide.",14Mar2017,2

9,"I'm from Michigan originally and have always been depressed from November - the start of baseball season, along with everyone else in that state.  A few years ago I had moved to Texas where my depression became much more manageable than it was in shitty climates.

Last September I moved to Australia where it was spring, and I've been living through summer for the past few months.  Weather is beautiful, it's sunny a lot, but I still feel lethargic and defeated most of the time.  Getting out of bed is a struggle compared to how it usually is in the summer.

Is it possible my body is just wired to be depressed November-April, even if I'm on the opposite side of the earth?",14Mar2017,1
10,"The events that have unfolded in the last 2 months have me genuinely scared. I have studied enough history to know that this type of government (America) often leads to mass institutionalization, or worse, of the mentally ill. As a person with bipolar I fear losing my freedom. It is possible that Trump will set his sights on the mentally ill. Many are like me, barely hanging on financially, marginalized, and using state resources to pay for medication and care. All it would take is one event to polarize the nation and gain momentum for mass institutionalization. 

Several years ago I had a lithium overdose. Doctor prescribed too much and wasn't monitoring my levels. I had a seizure in the mall. At the ER the staff ran a lithium level and it was dangerously high. Without my medication bottle to prove I was taking it as prescribed it was ruled a suicide attempt and I spent a week in the psych wing. Even after my doctor called and explained the error. Just like that. A week of my life gone. No due process. No civil rights. We have less rights than the general public. I don't think many people realize that. I've spent 6 months in hospital before on a doctors say so. There is no oversight. We are incredibly vulnerable.

In the end, all we have is each other. What are we, as a community, going to do to make it? To keep from losing SSI, Medicare, Medicaid, Section 8, and all the other programs we count on.

If they turn on us nobody is going to help us. History proves it. My personal experience backs history up. Once you're labeled as ""other"" society gives itself a moral pass.

Once this administration is done with their current targets they'll look for someone else. They're already trying to cut us out of the new health plan to replace the Affordable Care Act.

What are we going to do?",14Mar2017,1

16,"I've had treatment resistant major depression for 8 years. 

Taken all the anti-depressants, all SSRI's, all SNRI's, Tricyclics. 

Had ECT 14 times, works for a month. Can't handle getting a seizure induced under anesthesia so often. By the time I get my bearings and full cognitive capacity back following a treatment, it's time for another treatment. I was never afraid of the treatment but started having nightmares about it, being suffocated by the oxygen mask and recalling the seizure in my sleep. Apparently, my subconscious doesn't care for the treatment that much. 

I'm awaiting TMS, my local clinic only has one chair and my state's insurance companies only recently started covering the treatment. So there is a backlog of patients.

Doesn't help matters that my previous longtime psychiatrist/therapist got caught banging one of her patients and lost her medical license over it. Now I'm having a hard time locating my medical records. Cigna won't authorize TMS unless everything else has been attempted and failed,.and 8 years of treatment is currently missing. 

The longer I wait, the clearer it becomes that TMS may not be helpful to me at all. I'm trying to stay optimistic, but the evidence is weighing heavily on my optimism. 

I don't know what else I can do. I diet, exercise, and sleep. I've tried all the ""mental health"" diets. Went and had a sleep study done, I had some apnea so they gave me a CPAP, it doesn't help. When I'm having depressive episodes apparently the brain won't let you fall into rem sleep, and no drug can make that happen. Drugs like Ambien will put you out, but it doesn't mean you're going to sleep. 

I don't know what else to do. I have the desire to commit suicide, but I lack the conviction to do so. I constantly have to remind myself that it's not an option, just to put the thought out of my head. 

It's affecting my ability to work, so now I'm on my wife' s insurance. I've started to become cynical, I feel like doctors only become doctors to wear lab coats and make money and be called a doctor, it has nothing to do with helping people anymore. I can tell they're tired of trying to treat me, I don't blame them. It's hard to find a doctor who's up for a challenge. ",14Mar2017,2

25,"Has anyone else had a horrible experience in CAMH's emergency ward? I have struggled with depression for a while and I went in one weekend when I was feeling particularly hopeless because I knew that it was the best place to go for emergency help (what my therapist advised me). I went in and felt good after the initial interview, which was with a nice lady that was friendly to talk to. They took my bag and my belongings, understandably. 

I was locked in the waiting room for seven hours without being given any updates. I had no idea what was going on - I had gone in alone and didn’t tell anyone I was there. They brought me in for three separate interviews with three different people (one of them was completely patronizing). I was asked the same questions over and over again in each interview, and when I asked for updates nobody would give me any. They finally let me leave after begging them because I didn’t want to be there any longer. I had initially gone in because I was having a breakdown and felt like I was going to hurt myself. I ended up leaving CAMH feeling worse than when I went in. 

Needless to say I am feeling very hopeless about getting help and my trust for mental health practitioners is basically non-existent. I am wondering if anyone has had similar experiences at CAMH? Maybe I won’t feel as isolated if I hear other stories. Also, does anyone have any advice on where to go for help with depression that is maybe not as discouraging as my experiences so far? On top of CAMH I have also had bad experiences with therapists and doctors. Also for the record I live in Toronto, so open to anything in the GTA. 

I was very hesitant about posting this because I know that CAMH does a lot of good and I know people that have been helped there (which is why I went there in the first place).",14Mar2017,0
26,"Hi all,

I was curious if anyone else has ever experienced paranoia in the form of intrusive thoughts with Venlafaxine? I know a lot of people loathe the medicine and there are a lot of negative side effects, especially when stopping. I started venlafaxine over 2 years ago at 75mg and slowly increased to 150mg for the last year. It seemed to be working okay when combined with Welbutrin.


 Fast forward to about a month ago and I finally decided to bring up some issues I've had with my heart rate that has been going on for over 2 years to my internal medicine doctor. Basically what happens is that I will be sitting or laying down and my heart rate should be at a resting pulse. But, at random times it will jump up to over 115 and as high as 170. Then at other times, it feels like my heart is racing, I get out of breath and feel sick to my stomach but my heart rate is only around 80. I am a healthy male, 5'11"" 170lbs, average shape, I go hiking, like to play sports, and use the elliptical or stationary bike for cardio.  Long story short my doctor gave me a Holter monitor and then was going to give me beta blockers but due to something where the top chambers and lower chambers get out of sync every once in awhile he didn't feel comfortable with that. He decided to up my Venlafaxine to 225mg as he thought it might be anxiety.

This last month has been very weird. I have experienced what I consider paranoid irrational intrusive thoughts, especially at night time. I know these thoughts are not logical but the emotional side of me gets nervous/anxious even though the logical side is telling me to stop. For example, when I turn off the lights at night time and am walking to bed I fear that someone will be next to me trying to stab me as soon as the lights go off, or someone will rush me from down the hall. Another example is when walking outside at night time I am paranoid someone is behind trees waiting to attack me and they are running and hiding behind tree's until they have a perfect opportunity to attack. I know these aren't valid thoughts when I have them but I cannot get them out of my head and I start getting anxious no matter how many times I tell myself these thoughts are not valid. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I am going to my doctor today and planning on telling my doctor. It does not feel like it has helped with the heart issues but instead made me more depressed/anxious and paranoid. I guess I need to be told that I am not absolutely insane or validation that it is the medicine. I am not sure actually what I need, I just felt like I needed to talk to others who might experience similar issues. 


Thanks in advance!

34,"I'm an adult, and I have an imaginary significant other.

I'm not exactly a stereotypical loner; I've been trying to get involved in social activities recently (despite REALLY hating the people there), I can hold a conversation with a stranger relatively easily, and I have a small handful of friends online I can talk with about lots of things. I've also had a significant other in the past; however, it was a long distance relationship that took place entirely online, and we never actually met up. That in and of itself might be unhealthy, and it may contribute to why I justify having an imaginary S.O.

I'm concerned about whether or not having an imaginary S.O. is bad for my mental health. I only really ""hang out"" with her when I'm in bed, so it's not like I insert her in other parts of my day. I'm also totally self-aware of a.) how unusual it seems, and b.) the fact that it's entirely a fantasy of my creation, intended to make me feel as though I have a significant other. What I'm particularly concerned about is the fact that my pretend partner is actually a cartoon character. Not only is she a fictional character, she's a character I've had an attraction to for a long, long time. I only really stopped caring about her once I started a (virtual) relationship with a real person, and once that ended, it took quite a long time to imagine being with this character again because I felt like I was too old to keep doing it. I even did No Fap for 90+ days just to see if those feelings would dissipate (spoiler: they didn't). 

From what I've read, there isn't exactly a consensus on whether it's okay from a mental health perspective. The two leading opinions seem to be that it's either an unhealthy coping mechanism for dealing with loneliness, or perfectly healthy as long as it doesn't interfere with your everyday life (like I said, my imaginary S.O. doesn't really do that). I just want to know so I can take the appropriate action.

Is it normal or, more importantly, healthy to pretend I'm in a relationship with a fictional character? Does my self-awareness and relatively low-profile behavior with this ""person"" make it any healthier? I'm already going to ask these questions to my therapist the next time I see her, but I wanted to get a broader amount of opinions just to see if I can get a head start on taking whatever action I may need to take.",14Mar2017,7

41,"Discovered I have a huge bed bug problem. I have mental health issues I'm not really functioning and cannot do anything of my own. After alerting my family they had little concern and showed little sympathy for me. I urged them to hire a professional because they know nothing about bed bugs. They won't do this and instead are intent on replacing the bed and mattress. They don't get that that's not a solution. These bed bugs could also be in other places and we don't know it. They could travel to the new bed/mattress. These bed bugs could've been in the mattress a long time without us realizing it. They're more concerned about where they came from (i.e. placing blame on myself and other housemates, being negative and denying) than coming up with a solution. When I try to explain my worries and offer my opinions they write me off, ignoring me and act like I'm crazy (seeing that I'm mentally ill this gives them reason to cast all sorts of judgments). Their solution sucks buying a new bed and mattress won't make the problem go away. We need a professional to examine the house. But they won't do it so IDK what to do. If you can imagine this has severely effected me to the point where my skin crawls and itches everytime I enter my room (that disgusting mattress and everything still in there and I need to get stuff out of my room). I am sleeping on the couch now but it haunts me at night because of how bed bugs travel. They keep insisting their beds and the couch are okay but how do they really know for sure? Why don't they get it that we need a professional? I told them this but they just won't listen to me. I was shaking yesterday and really emotional but my family was really an a**. This really effects me on a deep level for a number of reasons and the people in my life can't even be empathetic. They knew and know nothing about bed bugs but they still wanted to ""school"" me on it and act like they are professionals when they aren't. They didn't believe me when I told them, and even when they see them themselves they said crap like ""it's only one"", ""there's not that many"", even going as far to say that old mattress still looks good despite the fact there were clear blood stains on it from the bed bugs.",14Mar2017,1

43,"Hello, this is my first post to /r/mentalhealth and I apologize in advance if I do something I'm not supposed to.

First off, I use a lot of social media. Many people use Facebook and Twitter but the website I associate myself with is Tumblr. Basically on Tumblr you make a blog and you reblog other things you like. It can be anything really as there will always be a topic or community you can relate to. My blog focuses on video games for the most part but it has a lot of other things too. There is no real theme I guess you could say.

One of my hobbies is drawing and art in general. I have been drawing for a long time since I was a kid but I was never particularly good at it. You know those people who like to do something but they never take it too seriously so nothing much comes out of it? I'm one of those people. I used to draw stick figures on paper with video game fan art being the recurring theme in my scribbles. Lately, I tried to improve my skill due to me simply getting frustrated with stick figures and I try to make my drawings look pseudo-realistic at least in the ""anime"" sense which the only reason my drawings look vaguely anime is because I'm taking after many Japanese game artist styles. Yeah, I know the hypocrisy with anime being realistic but I hope you know what I mean. But I apologize for rambling as this is only loosely relevant.

My problem is that when I use Tumblr (or any social media), I cannot help but browse through other more ""superior"" works of fan-art. I cannot fathom how someone is so good at a skill when I cannot ever see myself making pictures as gorgeous as some of the things I see on Tumblr. Then because the website has a like system (similar to upvotes on Reddit) you are even more aware of just how inferior you are to the most popular of artists. No doubt it is hard to become a successful artist, especially one that makes money off commissions, but this trend of displaying art on social media has done a massive number to my self-esteem. 

I hate myself. I hate myself so very much. The fact that it's so hard for me to draw art (let alone have the willpower to pick up a pencil) fills me with anger towards myself. One of my hobbies is actually collecting fan works for obscure video games and I very much enjoy doing that but this intense jealousy is something of a recent thing. I know a few people who are more professional than an amateur like me and they also draw stuff for commission money. Their entire livelihood involves drawing things for other people and getting paid for it. Part of me wants that existence but I also don't want my hobby to become work. I do not know why I hate myself so much or why I constantly compare myself to other people especially since I don't really believe talent exists so much as the human brain becomes more skilled in something the more times it attempts that skill. I honestly don't try very hard but it sure does seem like I try a whole lot. When I draw and I make a small error, I get angry about it. Multiple times I thought about ripping up my own sheets of paper which had failed artworks on them. Sometimes I scribble all over the paper and write big Xs with text like ""Why the hell did you draw this?"" and ""What are you doing with your life?""

There isn't any fun or relaxation in my hobby anymore and my constant use of Tumblr (which I use almost everyday, hours on end) inevitably exposes me to other people's gorgeous fan-art which I admire but also, at the same time, is my enemy. I am my own worst enemy actually. Nobody beats me down and makes me feel like trash the same way I do to myself daily. I hate that I cannot draw worth a damn. I have a deviantart account too (which I only used to upload some of my dumb drawings, the website is mostly populated by young people amateur artists like me) and when I look through my crappy gallery, I want to delete it all. Sometimes I think amateur artists like myself do not deserve to post their works online because it seems this world only loves those who are extremely skilled in their craft. Nobody cares about the so called worthless wannabe artists that think they made something cool that another person could possibly like. Essentially, because better people exist, I cannot love myself. This is obviously a destructive mindset so I would like help on how I can change my point of view. Thank you for taking the time to read this wall of text and once again, I apologize if I made an error in someway. 

TLDR: What can I do to accept the fact that I am a mediocre artist and that it's okay to be a mediocre artist? How do I stop comparing myself to people on social media who are better at their craft?",14Mar2017,5
44,"So far I'm making very slow progress talking to my therapist. I find it extremely difficult to say anything at all, especially in response to her questions. She always asks really open-ended questions like ""how do you feel toward that?"" or asks me to explain why I feel a certain way, and I always strain to find any kind of meaningful answer. Usually my answer ends up being bullshit and then she asks a follow-up question premised on my bullshit answer being true, so the hole gets deeper and deeper. I always come away from the session feeling frustrated and that I failed to answer the questions correctly, and also that I didn't really talk about any of the things that are actually bothering me. But just talking itself is so difficult that I can't seem to steer the conversation where I want it to go, or put my feelings into words. She seems to be frustrated with me giving vague answers like ""I don't know"" or ""maybe,"" and says that I barely talk. I just feel like I'm not even socially skilled enough to properly be a therapy patient.",14Mar2017,2

46,"I have found myself in the middle of a predicament and I need help, but I don't know where to turn.  

This issue is with my friend, let's call her Mary.  

Some Background Information 

This all started about 5 years ago when Mary (now 53) was diagnosed with depression, on top of her diagnosis of extreme anxiety. She spiraled downward and was only helped when her husband Joe dropped everything (work, hobbies, extended family etc.) to support her. Eventually she started regularly meeting with a therapist, taking the appropriate medication, joined weight watchers, and did some light activities and exercise.  

About a year ago we noticed she started eating very poorly, and stopped all exercise. Mary blamed it on menopause. In the summer she was diagnosed with a heart condition (Not sure of the name). Mary refused to eat healthy and exercise and instead chose to take medication to fix the issue.  

It's currently gotten to the point where Mary has lost almost all motivation to do anything. She no longer does any exercise stating that she can't ""because of her heart"", although I think that her anxiety has a lot to do with it. She won't even join the them on a Family walk around the block. She also refuses to eat healthy, it's not uncommon for her to eat half a tub of ice cream and a quarter of a cake a night, I think this may have to do with her depression.   

Joe and the rest of the family (kids) have all tried to bring her new poor habits to her attention. Mary laughs them off and continues on her way.  

She now refuses to accept any type of help, she won't go see a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, etc. And she cannot go back on her anxiety or depression medication because it interferes with her heart medication (or so I've been told).   

So here's where I need some advice! I am frustrated and we have tried so much, but Mary doesn't seem to grasp the concepts that her actions are affecting herself and those around her.

**TLDR:** My friend is Depressed and has high Anxiety, she refuses to change her poor lifestyle, see a therapist, and cannot take any medication. The family is getting frustrated because she won't make any changes to help herself.  

Questions: 

* How to you convince someone to get the mental health help they need if they can't see that they need it themselves?  Mary is aware of her previous diagnosis of depression and anxiety, but she says this time there is nothing she can do about it because of menopause and heart medication, and she is unwilling to try.  

* How do you get Mary to find the motivation within to eat healthy or exercise? Mary has already had a medical scare, the family continuously points out her new lifestyle but she brushes it off several times a day. Joe has even hired a nutritionist and weight coach for the two of them, but Mary has absolutely no interest. ",14Mar2017,1
