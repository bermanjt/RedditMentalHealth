5,"I'm on a handful of drugs for Bipolar II. I very very rarely get hypomania and I personally don't feel like it negatively affects my life too much, so most of my medication is for bipolar depression. Anyways, the only drug in this mix that I've actually felt anything from is Latuda. My psych for some reason is very back and forth about this drug with me. Sometimes he wants me to be at 40mg and then occasionally he gets weird and wants me back down to 20mg even though I haven't complained about side effects. I've never felt anything from 20mg, but 40mg gave me just a hint of possibility. Anyways, my psych finds that from his experience with the drug is that 20-40mg gives just as good of results as higher doses, and higher doses only bring on side effects. From what I've read from online testimonials though, is that most people find the sweet spot to be from 60-80mg for bipolar depression. i didn't bother to ever mention this cuz he is the doctor, but the last time I saw him he accidentally gave me way way more samples of Latuda than I needed, so I figured i'd take matters into my own hands. i've been taking 60mg of Latuda for a month now, and I'm definitely seeing results. not a silver bullet, but i haven't felt truly depressed this month, and have only had some low days here and there. 

i see my psych tomorrow, and am obviously going to have to fess up to him. i hope he's not too annoyed by the fact it took more without his approval, given that I'm having decent results. anyways, i feel like 60mg is like seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, it's the best results i've had thus far, and I really feel like 80mg might just be the right dosage to completely rid myself of depression, or at least good enough. i'm just wondering if anyone has had success convincing their psych to up their dose on something and how.

i know that what i did may be seen as reckless by some, but if you've struggled for 13 years with depression you'd probably do the same. anyways, the latuda website gives a lot of information and tells the dosages, and I was aware of side effects to look out for, so I wasn't too concerned, especially since i handled 40mg just fine.

i really just want to completely rid myself of depression, and this is the only drug that has done anything for me. i just want to reach a slightly higher dose and then start coming off all the shitty drugs that don't do shit for me. i'd rather a high dose of one drug as opposed to having a bunch of drugs in me.",04May2017,1

9,"I have a whole slew of mental things wrong with me clinical depression, social anxiety, bipolar, and constant back pain.  But what im wondering about is why does red light comfort me? My whole apartment is red lighting and salt lamps.  I just feel better.  I cant stand white lights when im trying to relax. I hardly every use them while at home.  Just the dim red light.  Is this a thing or am i just weird?",05May2017,1
10,"I've know I have some mental problems for a few years now. I haven't actually gone in to be diagnosed, but a lot of the symptoms seem similar to borderline personality disorder from what I have researched on my own. (I'm by no means self diagnosing, just a standing point) I typically have it under control I think. At least in front of others and haven't had a major episode in a couple of months. Until four days ago that is... Something triggered me and I went into a manic depression and started to self harm again. It was bad this time... and it scares me now along with the guilt. I'm afraid I'll go into another episode and do something worse. 

Here is where I need your advice:
I want to go to the doctor and get help. I feel relatively stable now. By the way my stable is usually quite emotionless with small bouts of depression and happiness mixed in. The thing is none of my family or friends have any idea about this. I'm going to tell my mother tonight but that may be all. I've heard that if the doctors think you are a risk they will hold you for multiple days. I can't really do that with college finals, although I know my mental health is more important. How should I proceed from here? ",05May2017,1

20,"Hi!

I made a Skype account not long ago, and I'm using it to talk about being mentally down, depressed, and a whole other mental problems. 
It got pretty successful, so I was thinking of sharing it here.

Justd612

Would like to build up some kind of a community, that prioritizes helping one another out with certain mental problems. If you feel like you'd want to talk, or you could help others, or you need help and are willing to change, hit it up. A lot of the times just a little bit of push is enough to set things in the right order.
And sometimes a whole lot of lifestyle changes are needed to get the brain healthy and happy. 
Whichever you are, there is a way out :)",05May2017,1

24,"Hi everyone. I've decided to make the step to see a therapist/psychologist. Problem is, I have no idea who or what to see.

I think I have some low form of anxiety? I overthink things to death, my mind is constantly running and overthinking and thinking about the future and what ifs and regrets and I just can't handle it anymore. When I'm in school I completely shut down from the stress and push people away, leading me to feel more alone. I constantly worry about my grades, what I'm going to do in the future, if I'll end up alone, if things I'm going through are ""normal"" and I want to stop overthinking and just live.

In addition to this my self confidence isn't great and I just went through a bad breakup so I'd like to talk about that too. 

Can anyone recommend the specifics of who I should see/what kind of therapy I need? Thanks so much",05May2017,2

34,"Dear r/mentalhealth,

I have posted this site in two of the bipolar subreddits and received a bit of feedback.  I am now putting it here with the understanding that new perspectives on mental health are sorely needed.  

It is not enough for me to accept that for whatever reason, many of us are sick individuals who need lifetime treatment to maintain our minds/brains.  I have done a lot of research, and this no longer seems true to me.

If you are interested in broadening your outlook on mental health (and human well-being in general), please take a look:

37,"So I am  currently involuntarily admitted to the emergency room and have been evaluated yesterday and today. I expressed suicidal ideation to my counselor and made me go to hospital. Now I totally understand why I'm here and in this position, I said some things that couldn't be ignored. I've been dealing with severe depression and anxiety for years, so I feel like it's good in a way that I'm here and helping myself get better. 

Now onto the bad. Well I had no idea about what happened once I got admitted. I figured there'd be people here wanting to help me but that is far from the case. I'm currently locked up in basically isolation, there is someone watching over me 24/7 and I have to get permission to use the bathroom or to even stretch my legs. I'm in a room with four blank walls, no windows and I feel like a criminal. My evaluator said I could potentially be in this room for the next 3 days which is ridiculous, before they find me somewhere to go. I've expressed my dissatisfaction and anxiety this is causing me. But they said if I try to leave the police will be called. 

I'm in a very confusing and difficult situation, I thought once I opened up about how frustrated I was for being depressed all the time and wondering  what the point was I'd get help, but that isn't the case. So I really don't know what to do, I feel like I'm going to lose my mind in this room. They gave me a tv but it only has old movies and that is my only source of something to do. 

Truth of it is, I don't feel suicidal  and I feel like I've dug myself a hole I can't get out of. The evaluator won't let me leave the hospital because she says I must go to a mental hospital to get help. I'm in college and there are only 2 weeks left, which is partly why I'm feeling this way. I don't feel like this is therapeutic and I could be in the hospital for weeks if they don't find me a place to be. I just want to return to my life at college and move on with my life. 

Sorry for the essay, but I can't talk to anybody and it's really starting to get to me 

**Update:**They have found me a bed at a very good mental hospital in the area. They said it's a voluntary stay which they said is good and I can't have any of my belongings with me which I thought was odd. I must also attend all of the meetings voluntarily. I've never been to a mental hospital, what should I prepare for, or any tips cuz I'm like losing my shit and have no idea what to do ",05May2017,1

43,"Examples. I see a cute dog or cat, and I think about letting our dogs out to kill it and eat it. But I don't actually want to do this, and when they get out on their own (or we're walking them) I always try my hardest to keep our dogs away so they can't hurt the animal they're trying to attack. Sometimes they're just too strong, or the victim animal walks TO our dogs (sometimes playful, friendly, not even vicious) and our biggest dog will go demonic dog on them and put as much of them as he can in his mouth, if it's a small enough dog he will put the whole animal in his mouth, pick it up, and try to kill it, yesterday this happened and our smaller dog joined in. I was forced to slam my fists into the side of our big dog HARD, because it's physically impossible to pull him away when he has an animal in his mouth, he won't let go, and the victim animal will just get more hurt from our dog's teeth pulling on their skin. I don't like any of the morbid thoughts I have, I hate them (more on that later) and when the things I think about actually happen on their own (I'll never actually act any out, but some of them are things that happen naturally in life) I HATE IT, and just want it to not happen.
Update: When our dogs attack other animals, I just want to get them away from each other and the animal be safe. Yesterday our big dog took a puppy in his mouth and lifted it up, shaking it all around, viciously trying to kill it (he also did it to one of our chickens when we had chickens, it survived) and I was just scared for the puppy's sake and freaking out, just watching it happen.
Update 2: As it happened, my little sister was screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... rightfully so. It looked so surreal, so the puppy kind of looked stuffed in my mind, because I can't imagine that happening to a real life animal. I was FORCED to slam my fists REALLY HARD into our big dog's sides in order to make him release the puppy, it worked, it made him open his mouth, and the puppy ran away.
Update 3: A lady was walking, it wasn't her dog but she checked on it, even picked it up, as if it were her own, comforting and caring for it. My sister was just walking home! I actually went back and said ""Hey! Is the dog ok?"" She said the dog is fine, she assured me the dog was fine, and added that it was actually her neighbors's dog and it was not our fault but their for letting their dog run around the neighborhood. 

We need Cesar Millan, our dog acts like he's possessed when he sees another animal.
Update 4: I said more on my morbid thoughts later, it's later now. 

When I have the morbid thoughts I DON'T LIKE THEM, but they play in my mind anyway. I feel AWFUL when this happens, I can't even describe how I feel in words. But I think I should kill myself and I will probably burn in Hell if Hell exists. I feel SO HORRIBLE it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to describe in words!

I will see in my mind, me letting our dogs out to attack a cat or dog and viciously kill it and eat it, and me taking a knife and stabbing animals, even tying them on a table and making it slow and painful, I HATE IT THOUGH! I HATE THESE THOUGHTS! SO WHY DO I HAVE THEM??? IT'S LITERALLY LIKE THERE IS ANOTHER PERSON INSIDE OF ME WHO IS THINKING THESE THOUGHTS, AN EVIL ME???",05May2017,1

46,"
Let's talk about my friend we have known each other for around 7 years now haha. She joked today that we already argue like we have been in a relationship with each other for several years... In the car haha funny. Except we Aren't in a relationship. I mean we would be if it wasn't for the circumstances, and yes I mean it, As co/dependent as I will sound I am still semi-cognizant. I mean I am leaving soon for university to study my degree and she is reluctant to be in a relationship with me because I am leaving soon, and she has plenty of mental health issues herself and apparently I am the only one who cares and pays attention... I mean if I am not going off on kink ridden tangents or pictures of various animals I am quite useful Haha.

I mean beforehand I was one hell of a creepy nice guy deep within the friendzone, I will admit to that haha... Gosh pretty sure I am happy I have repressed that. Now though having learnt how to actually communicate with human beings, things are more mutual. Lots of flirting, mostly sarcasm laden humour (yes I developed one!). We met up today.... I mean haha she dragged me around for 3 hours, it was fun actually. I feel safe with her. Things have changed I mean I feel silly saying it while only providing my perspective, makes you doubt it? 

Haha but beforehand there was nothing between us only my delusion, and her trying to be my friend and falling out continuously. Now there is I mean I can make her laugh, cry even... She is receptive of my flirting... Now she wants to meet me regularly, she is so nice. I can barely process it, someone who actually cares for me is such an alien concept to me. We help each other out, and As she pointed out we seem to have a connection... Something which has been building for a while. 

This is all so important to me and I feel bad pushing myself onto her when I am leaving soon but I will die if I don't haha... Oh here comes the crazy.

I mean usually I have homicidal urges/ideation, yet lately I mean without her I have to confront myself and I would rather die, or I will hurt myself so bad, so I have growing suicidal ideation. I am also a sexual sadist. 

However, I am not a selfish person I won't act on any of these things. I will fight it and with my hopeful future career I intend to fight people who are like me... I mean I am totally functional in my day-to-day life. I wear such a good mask and as much as I could tell you I hate it, I don't I admire it. I lie so much to people, I try and manipulate people. I have far too much knowledge on investigative/forensic procedure for anyone's good. I have many cluster B personality traits, I was sadistically violent as a teenager 15/16 I mean not explosive but calculated long term attacks. I totally got away with it too. I stopped because I figured I might not get away with it and my needs were too criminalistic by that point.

We kept falling out because I was a total asshole... And I love her (ouch my chest hurts (no but seriously), guess my brain has trouble processing intense emotional responses and makes them physical). So I promised I would be honest with her, and ever since things have been good. She knows everything about me, and she keeps telling me I am a good person, that everything I do has been good and that I make myself worse. I mean hell she is fairly receptive of my umm sexual preferences rape play etc, except for biting/choking (hard) and I would love to do that to her. Which she knows but open communication right? I mean we haven't done it just talked about it. I do have a tendency to be controlling I am so scared of hurting her... I know I won't I couldn't but I read a lot about psychology etc (what I will be studying) and like controlling, is not too far away from physical violence. I always control the controllingness I tell myself why am I paranoid I don't need to be paranoid? She does care about me, she won't abandon me... Etc etc Even really do I have a right to be, no. It is hard to drive these points home when everything else in your head is screaming the opposite.

I experienced a lot of trauma as a child on top of having CFS/ME simultaneously, and I would like to believe that how I behaved were defence mechanism, how some stuff I do now are defence mechanisms. I can't trust anyone, I trust her for some reason. I mean after all that pain and suffering, she came to me, she tells me now because she wished to help me... I told her she played with fire doing that... But I am grateful, so grateful. 

I like to think I am a good person, actions speak louder than thoughts so I must be pretty darn good considering... Fucking idiot I am, I can barely understand my emotions, however, I can understand others. It is as if I have based my personality of watching too much TV! Of course I feel real so I am, perhaps. 

Yet she is the one who redeems me I mean look how much she trusts me, she accepts me, if I am lucky she responds to the things I like! I know that I have this ""darker"" side (technically it is kinda hyperdefensive/aggressive/sensitive/numb side as a result of untreated childhood PTSD) to my personality, and she makes me feel better. Without her I won't have anything left other than my urges. That is the one thing I haven't told her, that she is the person which motivates me to keep them at bay because for her sake. The things she would do to herself if I ever did anything to myself or others. I won't let that happen. She gets so upset sometimes... Empathy is something I have in over abundance surprisingly I have to sacrifice a bit of myself each time though.

I don't want to leave her, I told her that I won't leave her I will visit often we promised each other to not lose contact. I... ouch again my chest... Damn, damn it I know in the long run this will be good, I just I am nor dependent on her I am just a nihilist and would rather be with her than not be and face this fucked up reality with my own fucked up mind alone.

What kind of problem do I have I have searched and searched and nothing quite fits I seem to be one huge cluster of poorly intergrated contradictions!
