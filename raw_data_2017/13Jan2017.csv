Fingers crossed that this is a sign that my depression is lifting already reddit friends and if it is well I hope all of you facing it get the same relief too. :)",13Jan2017,19,

2,"Hey /r/mentalhealth I have a family friend that is driving me and himself crazy thinking he has cancer. He has already gone to the doctor and had blood tests, skin tests of affected areas. Yet he still believes he has cancer. He thinks he is actively dying and will be dead next week but all evidence points otherwise. 

What should i do?",13Jan2017,2,

8,"TLDR; I feel like my brain is empty of knowledge and it is making my academic, professional, and social life difficult.

I feel like I have no knowledge stored in my brain. It feels like everything I learned or experienced has turned into short-term memory. When a subject comes up in conversation, I have to later go back home and look everything up about the given topic just to be able to build a framework of it in my brain and have something to say about it next time. Because of this empty-mindedness, I am afraid to get even an entry-level job that requires any sort of cognitive work. I did work at a restaurant - which was mostly just customer service I had to worry about - but even then I had a hard time multi-tasking and remembering to do certain tasks. Is this normal? This makes it hard to feel like I am advancing in my studies. I am worried that I will finish college getting a degree but that degree meaning nothing to me. Not in the sense that it is useless, but in the sense that I did not actually learn anything to earn it. This is also why I feel that I have not learned anything from elementary school up to now. I almost want to become a 5 year old again and start over my entire education (I am 19). Not only does it make it difficult to feel satisfied looking back on my education, but it also makes it difficult to simply be in college right now. Because I don't have any context for any given subject, I cannot connect the dots when asked to think critically about or analyze something. It is really distressing to practically not be able to use my brain. It has made me insecure about my intelligence also and I am afraid I will never be able to reach my fullest intellectual potential.",13Jan2017,6,

10,"I remember being a kid, I would have weird mental reasoning. If I picked up a fork or something I'd have to put it down but touch the cabinet an even amount of times. 

I've grown out of that mostly. But I can't stop worrying about the people I love dying or just thinking about eventual death/the pointlessness of life. 

I can't deal with this when I am among friends, family, partying, all this is catharsis for me. 
 
But other times I can't stop horrific thoughts. When I need to work, when I need to sleep. It is definitely effecting my sleep cycle and work performance, but I'm starting to think it is effecting my appetite and health. 

Im 24. Otherwise healthy to my knowledge. Great friends and a loving family. 

Is this just normal?",13Jan2017,6,
11,"*tl;dr: too 'high functioning' to be a high functioning schizophrenic, too many girlfriends and friends to be autistic. Does high cognitive ability tests, and inordinately numerous sexual partners preclude certain diagnoses by being an outlier, or simply preclude being a standard presentation?  I was under the assumption if I was high functioning my ability to... function might be more apparent.*
  
More nonsense:

I don't want to insinuate Schizophrenics or Autistic people are low functioning in cognitive capacity or relationship maintenance. However, I do want to know if mine precludes those conditions, naturally I am not 100% aware of the nuances and variability among these conditions, but I imagine they are quite profound in severity and presentation for any given person.  
  
I am bad with people, but pretty personable if that makes sense. I have no enduring friends, and don't seem to get invited places. I have been told I'm weird or say weird shit by most people at some point, however I am also pretty capable in some regards. I may not understand how to react or work well emotionally, and my life and cognition appear to be leaving me as I sit idly by. My room is a fucking disaster, and somehow I live in it and don't fix it. I haven't left the house or groomed in awhile. I wake up at 2-6pm and fall asleep around 4 am - 8 am. I am not taking classes this semester, and quit my job due to confusion. Like walking around leaving shit in the wrong places or having days my ability to speak and perform was fucking destroyed.  
  
I imagine I have some sort of serious cognitive dissonance, but I've seen psychologists and psychiatrists for 2 years. They decided I'm sorta not able to fit the diagnoses they have. I am bipolar but not, depressed but atypical, anxious but not really normally anxious. I've got some sort of chronic health problem, enough to have 'minor hypochondria kind of'. I'm either sick or crazy, but have taken all the sick and crazy drugs and had all the sick and crazy specialists determine they're not sure, and that the next drug is surely the best bet. I've tried probably 30 meds and am getting closer to yelling, not achieving.

14,"Just turned 19, have aspergers, and for the past 2 years? (where it became worrysome, still had bad memory before but not like now) Ive been experiencing really bad memory problems... Im pretty depressed (i have alot of daily stress on the brain but cant get away from it..) and I know that can contribute to memory problems, I also have pretty bad insomnia and take quetiapine (seroquel) and Fluvoxamine (Luvox) nightly.. I have an overly busy mind because of my aspergers. Always thinking more than the usual and I hate it with a passion but learn to live with it.  My memory is failing me and its really scaring me that this is permanent. Cant remember an event i went through, ill remember very little things, but theres almost like a mental block and just remember the things I really focused on in the moment.. Like I hardly remember my recent high school graduation and i literally almost have to think through the event from the beginning and walk through what happened step by step.. Its really depressing i cant hardly remember it.. Theres a fuzzy block.. Or like I wont remember the days before me.. Again only things i really really focused on.. When some one asks me if I remember a certain event i wont even remember it, or just a tiny snippet of it.. It feels like I wasnt even there because i dont/hardly remember the event.. Someone will take a pic of me from an event, i know it happened bit Ill look at it and wont even remember that it happened, or i was there in that spot doing whatever I was doing.. Like or when im writing something or talking, there will be a mental block for finding a certain word.. Ill try my hardest or strain to remember the word and theres just a block.. Another thing, like I just learned how to drive a manual transmission, i practised with my dad a few times in a parking lot a couple months ago for a few days and this week i was looking at manual transmission cars on craigslist and then i started thinking about what the steps were to driving a stick shift and there was just a mental block.. Again Im so worried this is permanent, and its so darn depressing, every time i do something big or small and its fun or memory worthy, i just sit there in the moment having fun then become depressed because I realized I wont remember this a week/year/few days from now.. It takes the fun out of doing things because I wont remember the event.. I dont know what to do, advice? I just want to get/feel better :'/",13Jan2017,5,

18,"Although I have not been officially diagnosed, I feel like I've been suffering from depression and social anxiety ever since I was in secondary school (known as high school elsewhere). It has been a rollercoaster of emotions; from feeling like shit and wanting to kill myself to feeling hopeless and just wanting to run away to some place no one knows me. 

To others, I appear as a optimistic, happy go-lucky person that never lets anything get me down but I'm so tired of keeping up that charade. I feel that people only get close to me because of the positive energy that I try my hardest to radiate. I don't want everything to just come crumbling down but I'm so so afraid that if I keep this up, I might just explode and go on a total rage mode. 

I have a good Friend, who I've known for years and I did try talking to her about feeling depressed, seeing that she's a nurse and should know well about this but she just dismissed it and says that I'm thinking too much and that i should just chill and play some games to keep my mind off things. 

I can't get proper mental treatment within my country as it will reflect within our medical records which will make it even harder for me to get a job. It seems so hopeless to me. Working at a dead end job, having to smile and be happy around people otherwise my parents will get mad at me.. it's so tiring that I often dream of ending it all but I can't do the deed cuz I'm afraid of breaking my parents' hearts. 

I'm sorry for this Long post but I just felt the need to rant it all out right now. :(",13Jan2017,5,
19,"No matter what I do this always snowballs. I'm so fucking stupid when it comes to emotional shit or anything that requires a lot serious thought. I'm so incompetent in handling it that I alienate myself and only make it worse. That is not to mention the larger power dynamic that invalidates everything I'm feeling and skews all that I do. I can't see anyone wanting to actually put up with my shit.

I don't deserve any of the people in my life. I feel that all I leave is a sad little impression in their life, I can't see anything good that I've contributed to anyone no matter how great of a time I've had with them. I always build-up a false narrative in my head about how good I feel with anyone, no matter what I feel it is always wrong and in fact things aren't as good as they seem. I can't see why any person would in any way want to get close to me.

Hell, typing this right now shows my weakness and the drain I have on everyone. I'm either a pain, a worry, or a fucking parasite. I can’t handle my emotions or my thoughts and here I am wanting to broadcast it to the goddamn world when this should be kept private.

Fuck I’m so damn incompetent with my thoughts and emotions that I can never fully express them with literally anyone (friends, close people, family, or professionals), talk about pathetic. It doesn’t help that I know I have biases so I’m always wrong in some way with what I am thinking/feeling.

Tldr: No matter what I do I always fuck it up or I'm too incompetent/worthless/out of touch for the situation in the first place. I feel that I'm constantly wasting people's resources and I want to put an end to that.",13Jan2017,4,
20,"I'm a 32 year old gay man. I have a BFA in Fine Art, I write, I'm somewhere between an atheist and a pagan but I was raised catholic. I love horses, martial arts, and gaming. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADD in the past, as well as very strong suggestions that I may have some severe ptsd. I think that I have Borderline Personality Disorder. I can't tell what's a dream and what's reality anymore. It's been the opposite of delusional though, really strange bizarre stuff happens and I convince myself that I've dreamed the entire thing up and forget about it. I feel like I've been a really shitty person to folks just trying to be my friends because I've had trouble maintaining my grip on reality when stuff starts to get weird and I don't know what I'm saying. 

I'm looking for a really good inpatient treatment facility that will allow me to work on my art and my writing while helping me remain lucid even when stuff seems too impossible to be really happening.

She has about 30 pills left. I found this out last night. She obviously goes through withdrawals every time she goes an extended time period without it. I don't know what to do. Since she told me last night, I have appeared to her to have remained very calm and understanding. However, I cannot quit thinking about how serious this issue is.

36,"Read somewhere that writing down your negative thoughts is a helpful way to start getting over them. So, here goes:

I have so much going well for me but I am a total mess internally. I come from a good family, am in great shape, have had a great sex life, plenty of friends, wonderful opportunities and successes. I am utterly clueless as to why I feel so hopeless all the time. 

I feel totally incapable of controlling my thoughts and feeling like a normal person. I feel inferior to nearly everyone around me - as if I place a burden on their lives. I'm starting to think that, in reality, I am my own burden. I feel hopeless at dealing with my intrusive thoughts - whether they are about anxiety, social situations, my career, school (exams and significant academic milestones, in particular), relationships and sex, or my own mental health in general. 

It all feels like a self-substaining cycle. I obsess over meaningless, pointless issues and become anxious, which then makes me obsess more. I have certain compulsions which I resort to when faced with anxiety - taking naps, calling my parents, masturbating, or narcissistically analyzing myself across social media. Suicide is a common theme of my intrusive thoughts. It generally becomes the most viable solution as I perceive myself to inevitably fail at nearly every aspect of my life.

My family and friends have no idea about the extent to which I struggle with these issues. I have recreationally used medication with success in temporarily mitigating my symptoms, however, I am incredibly frightened by the alarming potential for addiction they bring. I am a good student, but I feel incredibly bogged down by my mental health. I feel I could accomplish so much more in terms of my academic career, life successes, and relationships if I had ""figured myself out"" sooner. A behavior I often do is compare myself to others. Just recently I have made it a point to catch myself in the act and stop, which has definitely helped me a bit.

I am a first year PhD student at a major research university. These issues have plagued me since about 9th grade (when I first started feeling suicidal) and varied in their severity since. I am not certain if I have depression, anxiety, OCD or a combination of all three. I have made significant strides in my mental health over the last several years, however, I often feel I am fighting a losing battle.
