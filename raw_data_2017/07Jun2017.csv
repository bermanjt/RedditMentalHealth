0,"to express my thoughts and feelings sincerely to someone who is willing to listen and will care. Sometimes I even fantasize about doing this. But I am also afraid to.

It is a struggle for me every day just to try and use some facial expressions so I don't look like a stone-faced zombie, or ro add some vitality to my voice so I talk like a normal person at a normal volume instead of monotone muttering. I usually fail at even this.

I try to smile and make eye contact throughout the day so people will not think I do not care. I have gotten better about these things than I used to be, but it is still a challenge some days.

I often write, or you might call it journalling or something. I wrote in a notebook with a pencil about my thoughts abd feelings, or just what comes to my mind, especially when I am a little bit stoned. (or high, or whatever you want to call it. it's THC)

sometimes I write heavy emotional stuff. I often take comfort in the fact that I am the only one who will be reading these words. I sometimes write in Japanese as well and take a similar comfort in knowing that even if someone did see it, they couldn't read the Japanese at least. not that anyone will be reading it, or would want to, but I guess it's just the thought. anyway, despite these thoughts, I also fantasize about showing some of it to someone, or someone reading it. a lot of what I wrote is nonsense or bullshit, but there is sometimes good stuff in there.

back when I was unemployed for a long while and still living at my parents house I did this a lot more often than now. I have filled entire spiral bound notebooks. at least a couple by now, I think.

I want to feel vulnerable and show my true self to someone, or someones, even over the internet. but I am afraid at the same time. I am afraid of feeling vulnerable even to my family. perhaps especially to my family. the few times I ever get close to vulnerability or true expression, to family or otherwise, is on the internet, or sms. text. written words seem to be the only way I am able to express myself.

I am in a better place now, life-wise. I have a stable job and an apartment and I am alone at last. but I am still so very lonely, just as I have always been.

5,"I've tried meditating. I've tried breathing techniques. I've even taken a sleep aid, but cannot sleep for the life of me. I'm hit with panic attack after panic attack. The last few days have been insanely stressful. I had to buy our car insurance with money we really don't have, which meant being on the phone for hours yesterday. Then today, I booked a job interview for tomorrow evening after being a stay at home mom for 8 months. THEN at 9:30 at night, my fianc√© calls and says he's going out with a coworker and sleeping over there, and he'll be home in the morning. Now I can't breathe, and it feels like my heart's going to give out from beating so hard. I'm nauseous, and can't stop shaking. I'm so sick of living like this, but my doc still hasn't sent my psychiatrist referral after 2 months of asking.",07Jun2017,1
6,"Basically I have zero control of my emotions as a whole. Little things can really get under my skin and once that happens I'm a runaway train into depression, which can last days or weeks. 

For example I had been having a pretty good couple of weeks, hadn't let myself slip into bad habits, and was feeling rather optimistic (which is rare). Then one little stupid thing happens (literally nothing) and for two days I've been an irritable fuck and now I'm just back depressed and feel like I'm stuck.

When I experience highs (like going to see my favorite bands) I get really really high, like untouchable high. You couldn't ruin my day if you tried on a day I'm gonna see Phish.

When I experience lows I feel like I wanna die and there's no point in anything. I become a hermit in my bed and struggle to see any light in the distance.

I really need help figuring out how to control these emotional swings. The lows almost always start with anger or annoyance, and when that switch flips I have no way to flip it back off. I don't know how to come down from anger, and it always just turns into depression ",08Jun2017,3
7,"Hello all. I'm new here. I don't really know the ropes around here, but for those curious and perhaps to help answer my question: I have OCD, Panic Disorder, Tourettes, ASD, and chronic depression. I've had all of these since I was a kid and although I have had therapy and medicine since I was around 6 years old, my case is relatively severe and resistant to treatment (we're doing some genetic tests to find out why).
Anyway, the thing is, I have had sleep problems my whole life. Some of it depends in the medicine I'm taking, some of it I think is due the anxiety or depression. I've been on every sleeping pill my psychiatrist could give me, including melatonin and belsomra (sp?). None of them work. I am at a point where I am considering getting a sleep study re-done (I had one done as a kid, but they basically said ""there's something wrong but it's not narcolepsy""). I would like to be able to track my sleep at home in the meantime (and my pulse, bc I have tachycardia).

Basically what I'd like to know is, have any of you had experience using devices such as Fitbit or Apple watch to track sleep/pulse? If so, what do you recommend? I -can- afford either one but the apple watch is significantly more expensive and if the Fitbit works better for this purpose I'd rather use that. I don't care about other apps or the exercise tracker-I just want the sleep/pulse tracking to be accurate. I also have sensory issues so comfort of wearing the device is also important to me. If any of you have used any of these devices and have a recommendation or even if you really hated it I would love to know so I can make an informed decision.

10,"I'm sure my mom has anxiety/depression but she's gotten to the point where I'm not even sure why anyone even puts up with it anymore. She's super irritable, the smallest things set her off, she seems to spend more time angry or upset over things than she is happy. She's told us she goes to bed and cries and that she doesn't understand why she feels the way she does because she has it really good. I've told her multiple times since we've been staying with my parents to go talk to the doctor and I thought she was going to but right before she left she said maybe she just wouldn't bring it up. I asked when she got home and she said she did but I don't see any new prescriptions in the drawer. It's possible she keeps it in her room but should her attitude have changed if she's been taking them for a few days? I've tried to tell my dad that it doesn't need to be like this. That if she would just go to the doctor he could help her,that no one needs to live life so miserable. I just don't even know what to do anymore. I'm reaching the point where I can barely bite my tongue anymore and I'm afraid I'm going to say something and she'll do something serious because she said she didn't want to go on medication because if she ever did anything than people would know she had a history.

18,"I am 28 years old and I am facing these symptoms for more than a year now
1) I have a tremendous fear of going mad. In fact my symptoms started because I thought I was going mad. This was a year ago. I always think I might hear or see something, or lose touch with reality. As a result, I am constantly scared.
2) I have very vivid dreams and at times get confused as to whether they actually happened. As a result, it happens that when I wake up, I am confused as to whether the dream actually happened or not, and it is only after sometime that I convince myself that it did not happen. When I wake up, I feel completely helpless and think that I have lost my grip on reality.
3) I have an overactive imagination. As a result, I often act out scenarios in my head. When someone says something, I imagine that they will say this or that next. As a result, I am constantly berating myself and scared, as to why am I imagining stuff? I try to hold my imagination back as I am scared I will confuse it with reality.
4) Usually in the morning, I feel extremely anxious and feel I have lost my grip on reality, so much so that my teeth chatter from morning to afternoon.
5) I keep on getting mental images of things that happened long ago. For instance I will get images of things or incidents from the past that happened about 10 years ago or more. I do not want to think about these things or incidents, and yet I get these images. For instance I will get the image of my house that I used to live in 10 years ago. Since I have not visited these memories in a long time, I have forgotten how I used to feel about these things from long ago, and as a result, I feel extremely unnerved and spooked out when I get these images.
6) I also get mental images of things and places from my imagination/dreams out of nowhere. These also cause me to get taken aback and be startled and unnerved, as I think that I can no longer distinguish between reality and dreams/fantasy. I try my level best to distinguish these images from reality, question as to why am I getting these images, and somehow put them in a category that will reassure me that I am not going mad. I will get extremely scared if I get mental images/thoughts that are based in imagination/dreams and not reality. I will immediately try to find out whether I dreamt about this or imagined this, in order to reassure myself that I am not losing touch with reality. I can distinguish between reality and imagination/dreams, but when these thoughts/images pop up out of nowhere, I feel very anxious when I forget the source of these thoughts/images or cannot determine with 100% surety as to whether this actually happened. These are mundane things. For instance, I will get a thought/feeling/image that ‚ÄúXYZ said something‚Äù or ‚ÄúI read somewhere that ABC gave such an interview‚Äù. I will instantly feel uncomfortable and try to determine whether this actually happened. Once I determine that this did not happen, then I get scared/anxious into thinking that why did I get such a thought/image/feeling in the first place?
7) Sometimes I get distorted images of past memories. As these things never happened, they cause me to get startled and think I am losing touch with reality.
8) There are period of time when I am extremely confused and cannot make sense of things. During these times, I will catch myself, and think I am losing touch with reality. I will think that my thinking has become illogical.
9) I am scared of my imagination running away and causing me to lose touch with reality. I will often try to imagine ""what happens next"" in a scenario, and then get scared and think, why am I doing this? This is delusional thinking. I am losing touch with reality! For instance, if a person is sitting in the room next to me, I will think ""they are probably doing this or talking to someone"" or I think that ‚Äúthis person will probably do this next‚Äù. This causes me discomfort and panic as I think that my overactive imagination is causing me to lose my grip on reality. I do know that this is my imagination, but I feel very scared/anxious as to why I am imagining stuff like this in the first place. 
10) I also get memory problems. This is probably because I am thinking of my mental problems and not paying attention to things. 

I wanted to know whether this is just my overactive imagination/anxiety or whether I am suffering from psychosis? These problems began last year after I extensively began googling psychosis and schizophrenia. I don‚Äôt hear any voices or see anything though. I also lead a productive work life and have a good social life. In fact, for a year now, everyone else thinks I am normal, and I am the only one convinced there‚Äôs something wrong.

23,"Hello people :)

I'm here and talking about myself because I want other people perspective on myself and what sounds like requirements in my case. I've been on and off with different problems through the years, and my family is starting to get concerned about my well-being, which I don't.

I'm a 30yo guy from France. Since my early 20s, I've had to deal with depression and social anxiety. I've seen a doctor for some years, to help and vent to, but haven't been under medication. My depression still surfaces from time to time I'll admit, even if it isn't a problem to leave with now. Social anxiety is something else, blocking me professionally (I manage a team, but it's very hard to speak to everyone at once while holding my ground), personally (I have exactly 0 friends) and sentimentally (last relationship was 12 years ago, not a fling since).

My everyday life is simple. I go to work early, I work, I come home and stay alone until the next day, usually gaming. Once per week or 2 weeks, I go see my mother and sisters on the week end. I don't suffer of loneliness, it feels like the way to recharge. I close myself on the way to and from work with music and spending my time on a Rubik's cube.

As the years got by, the loneliness bothers my family, thinking that I must not be happy. I'll concede that it's a heavy load to carry some days, but it's usually the other way around.

I guess it's almost all I can say from the top of my head. Reading it as it is, my situation may seem like the ""end of the road"" for some, but it doesn't for me. What makes me come to you all today is that it worries my family and I'm too deep into this to think objectively. I would like a set of new eyes on all this, and maybe some suggestions on how to find that balance that wouldn't worry my only relationships. ",08Jun2017,1
24,"Hey reddit, so the other day all the stress of everything just hit me at once, I'm a bit of a procrastinator so it's a ""it'll sort itself out"" kind of thing. It was at my little sister's bday party and I got there in the last ten minutes due to traffic. I felt awful for missing her birthday. I went to the bathroom and cried so fucking much. Like niagra falls sorta shit. I beat the living crap out of a wall and busted my wrist and knuckle. When I came out my other sister (who's a complete twat) told me she told my crushes bf that I liked his gf. Lemme point out this dude is very very protective and untrustworthy. He had a go at his gf in the middle of the party and wouldn't you know it everyone blamed it on me. This girl no longer wants to talk to me (forgot to point out she likes me too but doesn't want to leave him due to emotional reasons). Since that mental breakdown I've been feeling really down in the dumps, feel like crying all the time yet I can't and I've been throwing up an awful lot.

Weight gain, mood swings, insomnia, malaise, and suicidal ideation are enough to have people run from these brain stimulating drugs. So why would anyone think of taking such a drug that can cause all these side effects.?

37,"I have one older friend and one new friend who are both depressed. The first one (we'll call her A) has depression because her family is poor and her parents are unreasonably strict, to the point where they didn't allow her to take antidepressants because ""it's just a phase"". She is a pessimist and, while it can be fun to be with her, it hurts to see her reject any advice and encouragement I throw her way.
The second friend I met a few months ago, B, is depressed, suicidal and bulimic. She has a good family, but is overweight and hates herself because she can't lose weight no matter what she does. We have similar hobbies, but I often feel like her psychiatrist when I'm talking to her because she insists on talking about her mental health in almost every conversation.
My point is that, while I might not be very compassionate (I'm not empathetic at all and I simply can't perceive other people's feelings the way they, themselves, do), I do feel an immense desire to help people, and it often tires me out. I love my friends, but I'm a positive, optimistic person who doesn't want to feel like I'm talking to a patient instead of a friend. I want to find friends who are positive people like me instead of friends that are very negative and pessimistic. However, I feel like I'm being selfish in wanting to leave them because of their mental health problems. I feel guilty, but staying with them mentally exhausts me. I don't know what to do...

40,"I'm a trans male, pre-t, pre-surgery, pre everything.

In fact I'm not yet out to my dad and I act pretty much like the average 'young lady' of my age does. The main reason why is because I plan on going full stealth mode after I'm done with transitioning, having as few people know about it as possible. This obviously doesn't do very good to my gender dysphoria but I'm convinced I'll regret it if I slip up now.

Unfortunately to me, I might have to keep up the act for another two years or so. I'm unable to change my name, get hormone therapy and such without completing the necessary evaluations, which for some reason can't be sped up in any way in my country.

The relationship I have with my parents is... odd. They don't necessarily hate me but I don't recall us ever having a proper conversation. Anything beyond greetings are awkward. My big brother said that his relationship with our parents improved once he moved out but without a job or a place to go I'm more or less stuck at home.

When looking for a job I notice I lack confidence. This is sort of dumb but it also pisses me off to know that whatever certificates I have or want to obtain, I'll only have to update on a later date, possibly twice because I'll have to wait another two years to change my social security number after changing my name... I also hate putting on makeup, doing my hair and dressing up in feminine clothes which makes me hesitant to apply for jobs that require 'looking presentable'.

My friends, at best, don't care about me. They claim to be supportive but do nothing to prove it. I get it, they are busy with their own lives but I wish they would at least keep their promises.

Gender dysphoria prevents me from enjoying anything and I think about suicide every day. I tend to downplay my depressive mentality when I see my doctors because my friend's transition was delayed due to him being so depressed. Seriously? What do the doctors expect.

I'm so lost. Sorry for the rant.",08Jun2017,1
41,"It took me a few days to decide where to post this, and if you have a better suggestion please let me know.

I am in my mid 20s and my mom in her late 50s. It has always been just the two of us. When I was younger, we used to joke that they drew inspiration for Gilmore Girls from our life. It has been a more gothic experience in reality. What I am trying to parse out now is that she is 1. alone in the world with the exception of myself 2. completely impoverished 3. extremely vindictive and nasty to me. Details below... 

My mom has always struggled with mental health issues, alcohol abuse, and poverty. I had a great childhood and was spoiled like the only child that I am. There were times/moments of trauma, but in this world most people deal with that. Despite my mom's issues, she always provided for me and I never went hungry a day in my life, and thanks to extended family, I always was lucky enough to attend prestigious schools. 

Since my grandparents' death within six weeks of one another in 2012 (my mom's parents), she has been on a downward trajectory. Every time I think she has hit bottom, the spiral deepens. She deals with extreme depression, and possibly bipolar disorder, although diagnoses are always a difficult thing to pin down. Who really knows.  In the past few years since her parents' deaths she has not only lost her job (paralegal) but her ability to work. She has always been a magnet for trouble but this has increased. In the year after their passing, she began dating a man who is now in prison for running a meth ring, she claimed that he raped her repeatedly before his arrest. She was with another man who eventually beat her, and we got a restraining order against him. The last straw before I moved her from our hometown to the city where I am currently living happened when she was gang raped on her block by a group of teenage boys. So after this occurred, about 2.5 years ago, I moved her five hours away to a new city. 

We were unaware that in this new city, the dynamic surrounding government assisted living (HUD/ Section 8) is vastly different and more discriminatory. In our hometown, she could always find a decent apartment in a central location, but now she is stuck living on the ourskirts of the city, in dangerous areas, without any good way to get around or network. This has been a nightmare. She has been through multiple suicide attempts and has spent time in and out of hospitals and psychiatric hospitals. Last summer she was beaten almost to death by a man who got into her apartment, and was found facedown on the street outside her apartment. 

I can tell she is beginning to decline again. She was doing okay for awhile, but it is always something small that pushes her to spiral again. She is convinced that a sophisticated hacker has infiltrated all of her technology and is sadistically messing with her. (She doesn't have many friends or people to socialize with, so the internet is a huge part of her life.) She hasn't been eating enough and has dropped a ton of weight, which is always a red flag. 

Now the answer seems obvious: I should be as supportive as possible and spend as much time with her as possible. Yet despite everything she has been through I can barely bring myself to look at her. She has constructed a version of me in her mind that does not exist. She thinks I am a materialistic, narcissistic, sociopathic, phoney. I know I'm not perfect, but these things just aren't true. She is a veritable fountain of verbal abuse. When she gets into a mood, I receive essay-length emails full of vitriol, batches of nasty text messages, repeat phone calls and voicemails. When this first began happening five years ago I was of course upset but I have learned to ignore it as much as possible and simply not engage with her. That doesn't really help. She tries to hurt me. She sabotaged my relationship with my college boyfriend by not only stressing me to the point of breaking by her behavior, but also by contacting him and his family repeatedly, harassing them, and telling them not to trust me. She recently threatened to do this with my current boyfriend and I told her that if she crosses that line, I will not ever speak to her again. At this point, there is not a single thing in the world that she could tell me that would shock me or surprise me, because she goes nuclear a few times a month. Beyond all this, she has absolutely no concern for me or the things going on in my life. It is always assumed that I'm doing just fine- which I am, but like any young 20 - something, I obviously do not have all the answers. She expects me to do whatever she asks, whenever, give her money for anything (most recently she demands $2500 for dental work), and throws these tantrums when I say no or when I do not do exactly what she wants me to do. 

I could go on for ages, but this is the gist of the issue. When I don't speak to her, I am such a happier person. She's given me a complex that I am not trustworthy, and even though I value honesty above almost anything else, I am constantly paranoid that people will think I am lying to them. I know she is a negative force in my life. Yet, she is my mom and she doesn't have anyone else, and she needs mental help/ financial support. 

Does anyone have any insight or resources? Thank you for reading! ",08Jun2017,1

45,"How do you calm you anxiety when nothing else works?

Short version:

I applied for a job (promotion) that I'm qualified for and have a decent shot at getting but my anxiety and my impatience have taken over and I'm obsessing over it.¬† I keep wondering why I haven't received a call for an interview (it's only been 2 days) and I'm starting to conjure up a bajillion negative reasons why they haven't/won't call and it's stressing me out even more.


Long version:

I work a variable shift staff job and a specialist position has opened up here and I applied for it.¬† My partner (same qualifications as me except I've worked longer) applied and got the specialist position at our sister hospital. (It's much closer to her home and I didn't want to travel that far so I didn't apply) In reality, I have a good chance of getting it.¬† It's literally been two days since the application was submitted to the hiring manager and I cannot focus.¬†I'm too impatient and my anxiety and obsessive-compulsive nature have throw my brain into a tizzy and I can't snap out of it. I am normally a laid back person, however, when I get excited or something is really important, I tend to only focus on it until it's done/over.¬† I love my current job and wasn't actually looking to leave, however, this position was my long-term goal and the person working it quit out of nowhere so I was not expecting to be in this situation for a few years at best. ¬†

My anxiety and OCD-ness isn't clinical and doesn't usually affect my life in a negative way.¬† I can usually reign it in but for some reason I'm not doing too well this time.

I've tried a bunch of stuff (meditation, prayer, breathing, etc. all the normal anxiety-reducing activities) but nothing is helping.¬† Prior to the position opening up, I planned to stay in my current role and potentially retire from it so I wasn't unhappy at all but now that the possibility of this position has opened up, I've gotten my hopes up too much and I'm too invested so I will be DEVASTATED if I don't get it.¬† And that has now turned me staying in my current position (which, like I said, was what my plan was in the beginning) into the worst option ever!! ¬†


I'm a pretty logical person and realize that I'm completely out of control emotionally and this is totally a first world problem.¬† I also realize that it's only been 2 days since it was submitted and they aren't just sitting there waiting to call people.¬† I'm great with advice for others in this situation and people usually come to me for help because I'm very good at seeing both sides and helping people calm down but for some reason I cannot calm myself down at all.¬† I haven't told many people at work because I'm too vain and don't want a bunch of people knowing if it doesn't work out, therefore, I don't have many people to 'vent' to and the ones I do have are probably over hearing about it already.¬†¬†

52,"Dumb as it sounds, I basically have a persistent belief that I can't stick anything out, and it is causing me major problems in two areas:

1. I am unable to learn or otherwise achieve any goal I set. If I decide today that I'm going to learn Python or something for an hour a day for two months, I will have a crisis day probably two weeks in where I can't do it any more. I am extremely distressed about how this impacts my ability to learn. I simply can't learn anything. I have lost all faith in my ability to grow or develop as a person. I dread each session that I intend to sit down and learn, and I will experience a nagging sense of anxiety that I would rate a 6 or 7 out of 10 while I'm reading the textbook or doing the work or whatever. Some days, this blows up and something shifts internally and I can't do it any more. This is not a one-off situation ‚Äì over the course of several years, I have attempted to learn many different things, and I have put a lot of effort into sticking with them, but I can't make it past a month-and-a-half at absolute best.

2. I am unable to work or even search for jobs. I want nothing more than to be able to work some shitty job that pays minimum wage so that I can provide for myself, but my the anxious feelings I have in this area are worse even than when I'm learning. They don't go away when I stop. I lasted three days at my last job, because the anxiety built up to a point where I started crying at my desk and having an embarrassing meltdown.

I find this extremely hard to talk about because it sounds so pathetic and because people are skeptical that I'm just being lazy and looking for excuses not to do anything. However, this isn't the case. This issue has caused me significant distress since I left high school. I have dropped out of a good university, an apprenticeship, a full-time job, and college because of the same recurring issue. I am unable to fix it myself. I cried and panicked for two hours just a couple nights ago because of the wording of a job description. It has reached a point where I can't even look for work without freaking out.

I have seen multiple doctors with regard to this, and they all say there is nothing wrong with me. I have been diagnosed with ADHD, for which I'm taking medication, but nothing has changed since the diagnosis. I'm becoming worried that I will end up homeless if this issue goes unresolved for much longer.

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any input.",08Jun2017,3

55,"Background: I suffer from depression, anxiety, an eating disorder, self harm and PTSD. I currently see a therapist, and am taking meds.

Does anyone else feel constantly irritated? I've noticed it most since I've started intensive therapy for my PTSD, but it was definitely present before. Little things set me off and irritation/frustration seem to take over my body - it actually feels like a (very uncomfortable) physical sensation. I often end up crying uncontrollably. Sometimes there's not even anything that sets it off, I'm just suddenly overwhelmed by it. I isolate because I don't want to inflict it on others, but most of the irritation tends to turn inward and I get furious with myself for the littlest things, including mistakes I made in months/years past that have little to no current relevance. 

I absolutely hate this. Has anyone else experienced this? What has helped you move past it? How do you calm yourself down? Normal distress tolerance skills don't seem to work. I'm hoping someone has had a similar experience, even if only to help me feel less alone with this. ",08Jun2017,5

57,"Recently i started breaking out of this but for years i had almost no emotion. The only feelings i would feel were anger, major anxiouty and stress.  I used to describe it as feeling content since i thought that was meant no feelings.

Ive taken multiple online tests (who knows if they are true or accurate) and all of them have said i had moderate to severe depression.


I sleep at random times
Multiple people have actually came up to me saying i looked sad (not same time but different dates.)
Play video games all day even when i dont want to and its not even fun.
Sometimes i barely eat or eat alot
Over sensitive to noise and everything  but white noise bothers me
I dont do what i love doing or even feel joy anymore.
Few times in bad moments i wanted to cut myself but only ised ny fingernails.




The worst thing is i think i know why this happened.


Is this depression? I will probably be back in a few hours to answer any information of more is needed.",08Jun2017,2
