0,"I'm 32 and live in the USA. I have always had a label attached to me growing up. It was ADHD as a child. Now it's schizoaffective disorder. I don't mind it because it gives me something to aim at when trying to get better. 

I'm on mood stabilizers to stop me from getting manic (usually results in spending sprees). However, I'm not used to always being so level. I'm either really depressed or thoughts are racing through my head at the speed of light. Here lately, I've been very very bored. It's probably depression too of course, but I can't use traditional medications for that sadly. I've gotten so bored that I've cut myself to make sure I'm still here, luckily not lately since I've been seeing my therapist. 

How do you handle being bored? Do you just sit and stare at the wall? Read a book even if it bores you? Watch tv shows you've already seen? I'm at wits end trying to cope with it. ",02Apr2017,1

I got on the plane and had an anxiety attack due to claustrophobia. I have been on many planes before but it's gotten progressively worse. I had to stop the flight and have them bring the gate back out for me to get out. I never made it to see my nephew. I already knew that my friend was getting married April 1st and I was in the wedding party so I sought out behavioral therapy to try and get on a plane so I could do the wedding without having to drive 20 hours each way. After 3 months in therapy, I flew out Thursday and just came back today. I conquered my claustrophobia. I'm happy. I met my nephew. He is perfect. That is all.",02Apr2017,2

4,"   I've been seeing a therapist and she thinks I've plateaued in my recovery progress. Lately I've been thinking a lot about why that may be.

    I've had diagnoses of clinical depression and generalized/social anxiety disorder since 2007. (Had some doctors call it social anxiety, others called it generalized anxiety with social triggers. Not really sure which to call it because of the mixed opinions.) Since then, I've been trying the coping skills that I've learned from therapy as well as peers who've been ""there"".

    At first, they'd work when I'd have a depressive day or an anxiety or panic attack. After a few skill applications, they'd lose effectiveness. I'd gone through dozens of coping skills until I gave up and just carried out my episodes. No sense in beating a dead horse.

    Since I can remember, (*WAY* before 2007,) I'd express undiagnosed inattention issues. Everything from always losing my train of thought mid-sentence, to reading something over and over again and it doesn't click in my brain, to putting things down and doing other things--which got me in trouble through out my days in public school. I'm not saying I have ADD/ADHD because I'm definitely not an expert, but I have had inattention issues long before symptoms of depression or anxiety came into the picture. I don't know whether it's neurological or illness-related, but for whatever reason, I had never been tested for ADD/HD. I've been to a neurologist in the past 2 years, however, disregarding the fact that I told her I've been inattentive my whole life, she refused to see me and assumed my inattention comes from my mental illness(es). (Also found out I wasn't the only one who thought she had no bedside manner, but I digress.)

    I've been trying my hardest to use acquired coping skills in recent times. I'm tired of therapy and want to be done with it, and I'm tired of getting in my own way and ruining relationships, friendships, and my life overall. Unfortunately I'm having the same problems with coping skill ineffectiveness that I've had when I was younger.

    Is it possible that my tolerance to these coping skills are because of some form of undiagnosed inattention? Has anyone else experienced what I'm experiencing (and can probably describe it better)? 
im looking for a ballpark idea that I can bring up next time I see my therapist.",03Apr2017,2

7,"I want to kill myself but I'm not sure why. So I'm gonna type everything I can here so this is going to be some really long shit.

This is not my usual account. Some people know that account's name so I thought it better to make a new one. Imma tell you my life story now.

When I was young (around 5) I used to imagine a lot. Like, use my imagination for different scenarious and stuff. Mostly it was copying from TV shows but putting myself in as the hero. After a few years it became quite a complex lore putting together a bunch of characters from a lot of different fiction from anime to classic literature and theatre. But I stopped with that once I was around 13. I'm 17 now. Nonetheless it was around that time that I made my other name.

You see, my name is not very easy to say in english. However, whenever I'm talking to myself (or imagining scenarious with characters talking to me) it is all in english. So how could I keep my actual name? My character (the fictional hero in the stories) needed a name that didn't sound out of place in conversation as my own.

So whenever I talk to myself or imagine someone talking to mee I use the name *Nyss*. Only one person knows of this apart from myself. I have done this since I was 12 (till then my fictional version of me was just my out-of-place name). After I was 13 I stopped thinking of the stories but began instead thinking of original real life scenarious. In almost all of my free time I think f real life scenarious set to music I'm listening to. Lately it's been a lot of the God of War soundtrack (shouout to youtube user Jolielegal for his uploads of the unreleased tracks. They should release all that stuff). It's like my daily life, but I'm called Nyss in it. I won't give Nyss' last name in fear I may have posted it somewhere online already and I want to remain anonymous.

I was not very social and was a very angry kid. When things didn't go my way I'd cry and shout. My parents told me they spoiled me too much, and even I could see that. My father is over protective of me, and constantly wants to hug and touch me and you may say this is cute but for some reason it pisses me off. I have no logical reason, I just hate it. The problem is he won't respect that, the fucker, so we always fight.

So, I feel really disconnected from people. I feel like I don't love my parents. I didn't care when my grandfather died (although I did use that as an excuse for not paying attention to class), nor when my grandmother or other grandfather died (though I only saw the last one once so I guess it makes sense).

I didn't have many friends when I was little. In the school I went to most guys were really into sports but I just hated them. I was chubby back then too, but not fat. So they were always talking about sports and shit and I wanted to talk about video games which did happen sometimes but mostly I was just alone. There was one guy that shared my interests, but something about him made me despise his guts. I told my mom I wished he'd get cancer so he'd die soon and leave me alone. When she said what I had said was awful I felt very confused.

Anyways once I got to grade 4 in that school I just couldn't take it anymore with the whole being lonely all the time stuff, so I changed to another school. I rememer doing things that people would mock me for like playing with my pencils, but then now I see people do that kind of stuff and no one bats an eye. I think the kids there, due to me being angry and a loner thought I had some sort of disability and used anything to make fun of me. There's another kid with actual disabilities in this new school, and whenever someone does something normal, once he does it it is suddenly a reason to make fun of him. I guess this is what I went through. I do make fun of the kid behind his back, because I want to free my anger on someone.

Anyways apart from what it may seem I'm not angry all the time. When I am not, I'm a pretty funny guy. That's always what people say about me, I make them laugh. But that's all I have really. I've no particular talent. Just recently we were all together (friends) and someone was stating each of our talents for some joke and once they got to me he was like ""uh..."" and everyone laughed. I'm sure they expected me to laugh along, because I myself am the one who jokes the most about this stuff, and I did laugh, but fuck he's right. John is good with music, Bob is good with computers, Steve does some sick fucking magic tricks. I'm Nyss, the weird guy who finds disgusting shit on the internet and people go ""wow"" over it and that's kinda it.

Really importantly, I've always felt very femininine. Because the guys in my first school all talked about sports a lot of times I'd talk to girls. I've lost this confort in talking to girl recently btw. That was even mentioned by one of my teachers to my mother.

So went to this new school and there I made some friends for once. People talked about more subjects than sports and I could talk to people about shit. Two years in, I'm 12, I'm reading a manga at the cafeteria, some guys around me, my friendsm and this girl comes and talks to me.

It changed my life.

I really really want to say her real name but fuck I don't know if I should. I'll just call her Cosette then.

So Cosette comes and talks to me about my manga, which in case you're wondering was Soul Eater volume either 6 or 8. It's not that good. We start talking and she's really into anime. So that was nice. Later in the day I hear and see her pointing at me and talking to someone about the new friend she met. Some girls in my class, the pretty spoiled rich type, always walked in a trio, made fun of me somewhat asking if I liked her. I didn't back then. Yet.

I eventually fell in love with her. She's short, blond burnt hair that over the years turned nearly brown, tomboy type. Super cute.

So I wanted to talk to her but she was in another class and we almost never saw each other. She became close friends with a guy from my class who was not shy of going and talking to her during break. Over the next few years I began kind of fighting against myself, for some reason trying to make me *not* talk to her. I didn't even know what she was really like, I just liked her for being the tomboy type. And I can't like girl only for their appearences, I'm better than that! Eventually I did realize she was one of the sweetest people I knew.

Anyways when I was around 15 this new school (not so new by now) announced this program where a Canadian high school teacher would come and teach for the afternoon classes. So we'd have two high schools going on at once but if we did do the program for like an year and a half we could go to a Canadian high school and study there and we'd get two high school diplomas which would greatly help for getting into an university in english-speaking countries!

I didn't want to do it, but Cosette was going to, and I thought it'd be a great opportunity to get closer to her and who knows we could talk. She was dating a guy now, who was really good with music. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, still don't, and here is a talented dude who knew since he was 8. He's really good with what he does, and has that whole attitude that whoever doesn't work is just being lazy and poor people are poor for their own mistakes in life etc. But apart from that he's a real friendly guy we quickly became much closer than me and Cosette ever were.

So I'm doing this program, now I'm in a class with her and one day our Canadia teacher tells us about how really there is no selfless act. Like, you can help people, but that's because you'll feel good. You can give your life for someone else, but that is because you feel it's the right thing to do. You can fuck someone else's life but that is because you feel it's the right thing to do for you and believe that is correct etc. That really messed me up and I quickly began getting sad. Was I being selfish in wishing Cosette and the guy would break up so I could talk to her?

""Why not talk to another girl?"" I don't like other girls. I don't like other men.

The idea of sex disgusts me. Both vaginas and dicks looks gross. I still masturbate all the time, nearly four times a day, but it's to other stuff. Hyper feminine huge-breasted women turn me on, and hyper masculine super buff dudes do too, but they have to be clothed. My other fetish is depressed chicks/guys. Thinking of someone cute feeling like they want to kill themselves is the best. I once saw an image of a girl who was in a concentration camp. When asked to draw her home, she drew nonsensical scribbles. I felt like I wanted to put someone through that.

So a thing I knew was that really I would never be able to have a proper relationship with Cosette. She was not attractive to me, and even the women that were I didn't want to get really close to. But I thought she was beautiful to look at. She was like a very effeminate boy, and I thought that was impossibly cute. Not sexually, I loved her like a pet owner loves his cat. Except that cat can talk and express feelings and is generally not a cat.

Anyways a year and a half doing this program, at the beggining I went through a phase where I really felt like working. I wanted to be someone famous and started working really hard in school and doing all my homework just like Cosette. It felt satisfying at first. A few months in however I just couldn't. She still kept at it. Most of the guys in the program were like this. I just left my homework to the last minute and fuck it. I missed my non-nerd friends that weren't doing those extra afternoon classes. We still talked, but I barely had free time with them. 

By now Cosette wasn't into anime anymore. She's a really strong leftist and into political stuff (although whenever she opens her mouth she doesn't really know what she is talking about and everyone kinda finds that a source for mocking). It made people wonder how they were still dating even though they were complete political opposites. I hoped they'd break up still.

So one day I'm talking about my problems finding girls I like (leaving Cosette out of it) to my teacher and how I feel I'm not sexually attracted to things the way other people are and Cosette sees I'm crying with my teacher and comes up to me. She wipes a tear off my face and says evrything will be fine. Then I realized/remembered I didn't love her for her cute looks, I did so because she was sweet. I couldn't cry like that to my mother. Last time I did she put me in a psychiatrist for 4 years and that was just a waste of money and time. Not even my teacher who was trying to cheer me up really knew what to do. Cosette did. She did just what had to be done.

I wish people would trust me to talk to me about their problems. They constantly say that when a girl friendzones you she puts you in scenario where she will talk to you about her problems but will never actually let you take her to bed. Cosette doesn't even do the first one, and I don't want to get her to bed. In fact I'd be glad if she told me she was assexual.

I blame God a lot. For instance, this guy I really disliked (we are strong friends now) kissed Cosette way back, and her current boyfriend is talented with music like I wish I was, although I don't wanna work with that. This guy I disliked is everything wrong with me from back when I had no friends, and the other guy dating Cosette is nearly everything I do want to be like. Still both are better off than me, bot have been closer to her than me. It feels so well design it's like God wants to slap me in the face.

God damn it you two just break up.

So okay an year and a half passed, I'm going to Canada for five months instead of having vacation. Everyone thinks it's for the diploma but really I just want to be close to Cosette.

That program was horrible. The ammount of homework was unberable. I just wanted to get back home cry and sleep. That christmas I spent the night after everyone went sleep listening to music based on Claude Frollo (character from the Hunchback of Notre Dame doomed to never get the woman he loves because he's a priest, so he goes mad and tries to kill her) and punching myself in the head. But I did it. A lot of people dropped the program, but I kept at it for her. Maybe in our classes together in Canada we're gonna get closer and her boyfriend who even though is my friend can hopefully fuck off and die.

I haven't felt happy since I was 10. Also I'm not chubby anymore at all so that's great.

Canada sucks ass. We get here and find out the north american school system is completely different. As far as we knew we could pick any classes we wanted but oh no no. You get to pick these like, ten. Fuck you.

None of the things I wanted to do are avaiable, unlike we were fucking told. Can we sue? I think we can sue. Nonetheless everyone is doing obligatory English 12 so at least me and Cosette are gonna be close sometimes.

Spoiler: They separated us and put us in different classes. I barely even see Cosette.

So I feel totally disconected from everyone else in this program who likes this place. I thought this was gonna be a Canadian school and but it's an immigrant school and almost everyone here is chinese and can barely talk to you.

Back when I was younger I felt really smart. Now I feel like I'm actually like, dumb. Close to all these people who came here because they wanted to study. Cosette is changing and she's very full of herself now and became a very oppinionated judgemental person. I'm not sure I even love her anymore.

Anyways I'm feeling alone. That whole selfless act thing is making me think of some much shit that it hurts. I'm feeling like Patrick Bateman, trying to fill the meaningless nature of life no one can scape from with random interests and going crazy and thinking of killing people. I've some papers where I've drawn murdered women, but mostly just to try and shock myself into feeling something. I don't feel sad when people die, is something wrong in my brain? Why do other people feel sad when others die? Why do you care? Am I a cunt? I feel like crying.

Btw her boyfriend is the only one who gets to do what he wants here, which is music. I constantly see him getting out of his music classes I wish I was doing and remember he is dating her although I don't care anymore but still feel like it's God telling me to go fuck myself. Hey, fuck You buddy. Go fuck a cactus.

Recently I've developed another character in my head. Her name's Johanna, and oh my God she's the sweetest thing. Though only I see that.

So because I'm feeling really lonely I go to sleep a lot and try not to fall asleep but instead to think of different scenarious in my head. However, now when I think of myself, I think of a girl. Her name's Johanna, she's black haired, same height as me, boyish type, has no friends and is suicidal. She's cute in a weird way. Think a fusion of Tomoko from Watamote (in fact if you want to know what my life in school would be like if I were a girl just read Watamote) and Violet Parr from Disney's the Incredibles. Can't think of real life people that ressemble that.

So Johanna and I are very close because we can actually talk about each other's problems. We are the same brain functioning, so we know what each other feels and there's no mistake like with other people misisterpreting what you say. She's worse off than me because her social anxiety is much more severe, and we disagree and discuss quite a bit in my head. She's bi and doesn't know how to deal with that because like me, the genitals are gross problem. I wish she could be real and we could just talk through the night about random bullshit. That'd be the best.

Recently I dreamed a very impactful dream. It was a guy, very angry, endlessly shouting at something or someone, maybe a group of people. It was all very dark, he was tall and slim (I'm not particularly tall. I'm avarage), and his hair was a bright shiny red/pink. You couldn't see his eyes. As soon as I woke up I felt exhausted and I knew that guy was Nyss. That's him, right there. That's me when I feel like murdering my parents for telling me to go brush my teeth or shoving my teachers ribs up their assoles and making then eat their fucking children when they give me homework. He was mad at something in the dream but I don't know what.

So like since last week I've been going to this online chat and talking through Johanna. Being a girl apparently gets you a lot of attention. I feel bad for making these people believe I'm a girl, but really it is Johanna talking to them. If she could have a body of her own outside of me then great, but that's impossible. Even if I could somehow look like her irl maybe with some make up (although she almost never wears any) I'm not sure she'd like me going around pretedning to be her. This one guy has been texting her about her social awkwardness and trying to help (maybe he just wants nudes that asshole) and she's nervous both because well talking to strangers and being open about yourself is hard, and also because if he ever requests proof of her she knows I can't provide that. I'm trying to learn how to imitate a girl's voice, it seems doable. I don't want to waste anyone's time online with them thinking I'm a woman. It's a public chat with a lot of people and I don't want to get particularly attached to anyone I might upset.

I don't know what else to say. Johanna also has sudden murederous tendencies but she's dealing about it a lot better than I am, I think. I should be doing homework now. It's 3 am and there's classes in 4 hours, but there's a lot I've left for the last minute typing this for the past two hours.

So I guess the question is: Should I go see a doctor or kill myself or what?",03Apr2017,1

Anyways, he came home from it and when I asked when his next appointment was, he told me it was in 8 weeks. From what I've researched, most appointments seem to be spaced around 1-2 weeks apart. Eight seems way too long and it seems like these sessions are going to be unhelpful if they're spaced that far apart.

Sometimes it irritates me so much just the sound of people talking. I just want to scream: ""Shut up!"" even when they're trying to have a conversation with me. Don't get me wrong, I can listen to music all day long and I enjoy it, I can stand the sound of cars passing by, I can even stand dogs barking, the sounds of birds, of the rain, I love sound, but when people talk, not all the time, but many, it irritates me so much, it's like if my ears were itchy, I want to cover them, I want to run away. It's honestly so desperating. People talking, chewing, breathing, it's something that my brain doesn't take very well. 
Yesterday I was having dinner with my parents and we were having a conversation and all of sudden I jumped off the chair and walked a little bit away with a disgusted face because of the noises they were making. They started to ask me: ""What happened?"", they were very worried and I didn't know what to say, I obviously knew what happened but I didn't want them to feel bad. My dad said: ""I think she tripped with the stairs"" and that was like the perfect excuse, I agreed with that.
I'm really worried because it's not that I hate people or anything, I want to hear them, yesterday we were having a decent conversation but this came over to ruin it. I really do want to listen to people but just describing my feelings seems like I hate people and that's not it.

I want to be the type of person that does things right and that succeeds. I want to love myself and be proud of myself but I'm not. I'm not at all because there is always a problem with me. I don't care if I die and it's scary. I am 22 years old and feel like I'm wasting my time. Something inside me tells me that I should just die. ,03Apr2017,1

33,"I have been going through a really hard time.
My boyfriend hasn't been talking to me and told me he didn't love as much as he use to.
I have been attacked and harassed for doing stupid shit online.
I am so mentally unwell.
I have nothing and no one right now and I can't stop crying.
It is hard to go into so much detail just in this. I just severely need support.",03Apr2017,1
34,"I have had anxiety and depression for many years but have off and on made some progress on bettering myself.

I started drinking coffee last summer and am definitely pretty addicted to it.. i have like 2 glasses of caramel macchiato espresso per day.

some days I just feel really lethargic and meh and even less like theres a source for my anxiety, and im wondering if my coffee consumption could be contributing to that..

35,"I don't understand them. They usually talk about some serious and very damaging symptoms of a mental illness but try to make it seem funny in an ironic way, and I understand ironic humor, just not in this context. They only remind me of the shit things I go through, they don't serve to make me laugh. ",03Apr2017,4

39,"I am an 18 year old second-semester freshman in college and over the course of the last 6 months or so, I have noticed that my cognitive abilities have been gradually declining, worryingly so. During my first semester, I performed well and achieved a 3.75 GPA; although, I can't attribute that to much effort or knowledge because entry level classes are meant to be less difficult. 

Throughout that semester, I became considerably addicted to nicotine due to the social aspect of smoking. On occasion, I would smoke 1-3 cigarettes or so every other day, and eventually it became habitual. Another thing I should mention is that I also began to vape excessively while studying/working as it would improve my concentration and it acted as a habit that quelled any nervousness/anxiety. During my downtime, I would do the same, so much so that I eventually built up a ridiculous tolerance to the stimulant. 

As the months progressed, I noticed that I was becoming increasingly absent-minded and forgetful. It has become so detrimental that I often have to reread sentences because I lose my train of thought. In class, I struggle to follow the professor's lecture, which hinders my ability to actively engage and participate. All of this has been coupled with an intense brain fog, a feeling of tingling/numbness in different parts of my head, and almost a sensation of sleepiness, as if I'm not well-rested/my eyes aren't fully open. 

My use of drugs other than nicotine has been minimal. I don't smoke weed often, although I did smoke a moderate amount the first week or so of the 1st semester. Sparingly, I take 100mg of modafinil prior to an exam in order to boost my critical thinking/decision making, especially for multiple choice tests. I've had a few experiences with adderall; however the last one resulted in a panic attack, so I stopped taking the drug. I should mention that I'm not overweight; however, I don't exercise often due to a spinal fusion that I had around two years ago. I sleep approximately 6-7 hours a night; however, I tend to wake up multiple times during the night and have to fall back asleep. Another thing I've noticed is that it used to take me a while to fall asleep, yet now I can do so much more easily. Coinciding with the topic of sleep, I have also noticed that it's become increasingly difficult for me to remember my dreams upon waking. I should also mention that I have almost no sex drive or appetite, yet for a short period, I was having sex on a frequent basis and masturbating daily, usually in conjunction with my nicotine usage (I mention this because I don't know if both, in conjunction, have done damage to the dopamine centers of my brain). 

I used to be able to write out an entire, cohesive essay with no issues. Now, I struggle to find the words and take a lot more time error-checking. I have also noticed a decline in my ability to comprehend simple mathematical concepts; rather, it takes me longer to solve simple problems. 

I have had a general blood test done and I have no vitamin deficiencies/thyroid issues. I'm still waiting on Lyme disease results. I have also been to an allergist and I don't have any food allergies that could be causing it. 

Most doctors have attributed it to a combination of depression/anxiety, but I'm hesitant to go on an SSRI for fear that it will worsen the fog, not alleviate it. 

At this point, I'm just concerned that I have possibly caused permanent damage to my cognition, which could potentially affect the course of my entire life. I appreciate any input, please help me escape this fog!",03Apr2017,7

41,"Anorexia and bulimia, along with severe anxiety, depression, and ptsd landed me in the psychiatric hospital last August, right as school started back up. When I was admitted, I was 107 lbs. It is now April, and I am 127.2 lbs, all gained through healthy diets and exercise. I haven't made myself throw up since November. I make myself eat at least 2 times a day. I am at a healthy weight for the first time in my life, and its taken a huge toll on my mental health. With more energy, its a bit easier to get motivated and get out of bed in the morning. Without constant headaches and aches, I'm less crabby. I feel refreshed. Not only have I gotten healthier physically, but my anxiety is almost completely under control. At school, I am able to buy food and eat in front of people for the first time in 10 years. I'm happier, its easier to open up to people, and I have a better outlook on life. 

Last August, I tried to kill myself. Last April, I was 94 lbs. Last year, I was self harming, abusing drugs, and couldn't go out in public without having an anxiety attack. Today, I am healthy and happy. I know it won't last forever, but I'm finally making progress. I told myself I had to get better whether I liked it or not, I took vitamins, drank lots of water, ate breakfast, stopped skipping my meds. And I am getting better. I just wanted to let that out to the world, I've been struggling for so long and I finally feel free. It got better, it always gets better. I just had to keep that in mind. 

And it will get better for you too, I promise, just keep an open mind. 

P.S. Feel free to comment or message me if you'd like some positivity or more information on my story. ",03Apr2017,5
42,"I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder a few years ago, and recently started seeing a psychiatrist for it (again) and taking medication (again)

I am considering applying for a medical withdrawal at school, but to qualify, I need to be in care, unable to attend school. Which means I'd need to go to an inpatient program.

I don't know what to do. I probably should go. I think about suicide more than I should. I have plans, I could execute them if I wanted to. The voices and shadows are getting worse. I'm not able to control my emotions as well as I could before. My anxiety is through the roof, I feel like my head is going to explode.

I'm really worried two things, which have prevented me from going.
1. Not being able to smoke or have access to nicotine.
2. Methadone. (I've been on methadone maintenence for 5 years, last time I went a couple days without a dose I had a panic attack and went into pretty bad withdrawals.)",03Apr2017,2
