1,"I have always been a huge procrastinator, so I have been chalking up my symptoms to that fact, but its starting to become and incredible problem.  I just started college in September in a subject area that I have always been very passionate about (programming and computer engineering), yet I haven't gone to a single class after the first week.  I began by setting an alarm to wake up for a 10:00 am class at 9:00, but I would just turn off my alarm and go back to sleep.  Not because I was tired, I've been getting 9-11 hours of sleep every night, but just because I didn't feeling like getting up.  It's not just classes, but If I wake up and I'm hungry, I'll just lie in bed and ignore it.  I rarely want to get up to do anything.  The only thing that is easy for me to do is leave my bed to play on my computer.  I have been neglecting schoolwork for weeks and it is starting to haunt me a bit.  How do I get myself not just on schedule, but in a place where I want to do things again?",07Nov2017,3,

4,"Ever since I can remember, I've had this overwhelming feeling. It's nearly impossible for me to find words to explain it because it's hard to comprehend. I feel as though I'm different from everyone, and not in the hormonal teenager way (I'm 26). I feel as though I'm somehow different.
It's as if every person in the world is a useable character, but the player has chosen mine to look through. Not to play and control, but to live. Feels like everyone else is a computer character and I'm an actual person. It felt almost like I'm in the matrix, only instead of the feeling that the world isn't real, I would think that the people around me aren't.
I have these brief fleeting moments once or twice a year where I become almost like hyper aware of the situation and I just freeze and my mind goes crazy with the overwhelming feeling. As a child in those moments I used to think that I could control things with my mind, and that in those moments was when I was in control or focused. I would try to move things with my mind, levitate and read people's minds to no avail.
I feel in control of my life but at the same time I feel as though I was somehow chosen, like I'm the chosen one, the second coming of Christ is what the naive me used to think. 
Some brief backstory; I was diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression, tourettes syndrome, and schizophrenia (no meds) as a child and was medicated. None of the medications affected this feeling however, it persisted. I'm also a recovering drug addict and alcoholic coming up on 9 years next month.
My life is not a mess, I own my home, am a good student at my local college and no one is aware of any of these things, to them I am completely normal.
The feeling I described above doesn't affect my day to day life and most of the time I'm not even aware of it unless it pops into my head.

5,"I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. I am a little worried that I have an eating disorder, but I think it's fine and I definitely don't want to make a fool out of myself and say I have one when actually there's nothing wrong with me. I eat. Lately I've been too stressed out to eat breakfast or lunch, but I always eat dinner. I count calories compulsively. Yesterday and today I ate way too many calories. I don't know if a person can have an eating disorder and eat too much. In the two days before yesterday, I ate less. It all averaged out to an almost okay amount. I don't know if that makes me disordered or if that makes me a normal person. I like the way not eating feels, but I also like the way eating feels so I don't know. I'm not underweight, but I wish I was. Does this sound like it could be an eating disorder or am I making it up?",07Nov2017,2,
6,"[Disclaimer:  I know this is all kinds of wrong and I don't condone going off (or on) meds without a doctor's guidance.]

I went on citalopram for depression maybe 8 months ago. I had good insurance then through my work and talked everything over with a doctor and went to counseling regularly as recommended. 

About 4 months ago, I moved, to go back to school, so the insurance situation has been *transitional* for a bit now. I just now got back on insurance and it's way worse coverage than what I had before, and I'm paying a ton for it. I don't have a primary care doctor quite yet and I don't think this plan is going to make therapy affordable. I am aware that many college campuses offer a certain number of counseling sessions without charge, but I'm working most of the time when I'm not in class and I'm not sure if it's something I'm really going to look into or not.

Anyway, my citalopram (Celexa) ran out a few days before my new insurance was due to start. Since my life's pretty busy these days anyway, it was pretty convenient to just figure I'd go off of it for a bit until I was insured again. 

For a few days, it was pretty rough. I was mostly just more drowsy/dazed/out-of-it than normal. I later googled that situation, and found that it's strongly not recommended to cut it out all at once instead of easing off of it. Whoops. 

I set up for my prescription to be transferred to a pharmacy near me and filled last night. I haven't heard back that it's ready yet, but I'm starting to have doubts. The last couple days, I've been able to get back into a lot of interests I'd kind of abandoned. I've felt energetic, and enthused about things. I've always kind of suspected that anti-depressants numb my creativity and make me kind of ""blurry"" all the time (for lack of a better word). 

I'm not exactly sure what to interpret from this. Obviously, how I feel a week after going off of this isn't necessarily how I'm going to feel three months after going off of it, and I know from the past that it's a lot harder to admit when it's time to be medicated again when I'm already at the bottom. Maybe I've been on too high of a dose? I'm still on Wellbutrin for anxiety and depression, so I'm not totally going unmedicated. 

Does anyone have any suggestions of what to make of this?

tl;dr :  went off citalopram/celexa suddenly, experiencing unexpected mood boost. how should i interpret this?",07Nov2017,2,

Everyone seems to make me so depressed, like I can’t even trust anyone anymore because I’d feel like they’d betray me.

",07Nov2017,1,
12,"I’ve been lying about my moods for two months now. I live with my parents, and my mom knew my anxiety’s been really bad. I had ECT in July, and I was doing ok for a while. When I was released from the hospital my anxiety was there but I was doing the best I had in years. Then the anxiety started getting worse and I started to have nightly nightmares. I told my mom but she doesn’t understand. So I started lying to her, telling her everything was fine, because she was so proud of how well I was doing. Then I had to lie to my only friend, because she was so happy I was finally happy. Then I had to lie To my nurse and doctor, because they were so glad that they’d finally found a treatment that worked. And then I started lying to myself, because I needed to believe the lies. But it was ok, I kept telling myself, everything would work out. Meanwhile the anxiety and depression kept growing under the lies and festering like an ignored and infected wound. Then the voices cane back, or rather a voice. Her name is Annie. She’s British, and she reads my mind, and asks me questions based on what I’m thinking. Sometimes she tells me to hurt myself. But she keeps me company at night when the anxiety’s the worst, so she’s not so bad. But every night I have panic attacks, and I tried to keep quiet so my parents wouldn’t hear me, but the panic attacks fuelled the nightmares, and now I’m afraid to go to sleep, or even go into my room, which used to be my safe haven, because I know as soon as the lights go out and it’s quiet the truth is going to hit me. Last night I had the worst panic attack yet. I was crying, and rocking back and forth and slamming my fists into my head, and talking nonsense all while whispering to myself “it’s ok, I’m ok, I’m happy”. This little voice in my head was whispering for me to throw things, break everything in sight, light everything on fire, scream until my throat was raw. I fought so hard not to. And then I wanted to cut myself, to stab myself, to cut off my fingers, and I had to fight not to do that. And then I wanted to kill myself, to strangle myself with a belt or slit my wrists or go take every pill in the medicine chest, and I had to fight that too. To distract myself I turned on my favourite Marianas Trench album, Fix Me, and listened to it on repeat, like I always do when I’m having a meltdown. And I grabbed my teddy bear and laid down and cried myself to sleep around midnight. Then I woke up crying at 2:30 and cried myself back to sleep. Then I woke up at five and stated up at the roof telling myself I can’t do this anymore. Then I fell back asleep around 6. I woke up at seven thirty and somehow made it to work, and then had a breakdown in the bathroom. I decided I had to text my mom and tell her everything. She calmed me down enough to clock in and get through the day, but when I got home I broke down and tried to tell her everything, but she didn’t understand, and I could feel the disappointment pulsing out of her. And my dad is mad and every time I try to tell him what my anxiety is like his answer is basically don’t be anxious. And I’m going to have to tell my nurse and doctor and they’re going to be so disappointed in me and they’ll probably send me back to the hospital and I’ll lose my job and I can’t take this anymore. When I had the ECT I told myself if this didn’t work, I’d finally kill myself, once and for all. Maybe I should. I’m broken beyond repair. Something went wrong in my brain and I just don’t possess the ability to be happy. I’m so tired of this. I first tried to kill my self when I was thirteen. I started cutting when I was twelve. I’m twenty two now. I’ve tried to kill myself so many times I’ve lost count, and I’ve been hospitalized over thirty times. Obviously if there’s a god he realized he fucked up in making me and decided that I should be wiped off this earth, so he made me as miserable as possible. That’s why I don’t believe in god. I just can’t believe someone would want me to live this life. ",07Nov2017,2,

14,"I recently transferred to a new college. At my last college I remember dreading going back after winter break. I didnt want to be there anymore.

I am at a new school now and Im sitting on my boyfriends couch crying because I am just so stressed out and I dont want to do it anymore. I know I have to. I know its what I need to do. But its so hard. Its so hard when it all feel like too much, but this school isnt even that bad! I have Friday off and my earliest class is noon and I am done by 3:15 everyday. I just dont know.

15,"I ran into my cousin the other day. I've known for a few years that she has been declining in her mental state. And it's not Alzheimers. She is young. She is under 40 years old. It's hard to explain what she's going through. It all started out a few years ago where you would say something to her and she would seem confused. Her facial expressions aren't normal. She doesn't make sense anymore when she talks, even though she's smart. 

She was normal at one point in time. A quiet girl who seemed very normal. Now she's hyper and she talks about many things and then changes the conversation rapidly. Then forgets things and changes the conversation instantly, almost like she's talking to herself. 

When she wanted to buy something she had a hard time deciding. She would constantly put back the protein bars and then pick them up several times. She would ask about the deals and then put them back and repeat the process. Then she talked to herself a great deal while she got out her money.

So that was one thing. Then she started telling me my sister needs to lose more weight. It was a little forward, but I didn't say anything and just went along with it. But then we went to the parking lot to try to find her car and we walked around the whole parking lot and then she had just remembered that she doesn't drive anymore. She had walked to the gym. 

So I drove her home and she started talking about all these shopping deals and wasn't making a lot of sense. One deal after another. Then she would tell me not to eat sugar, then she's talk about a new shopping deal, and then she'd talk about diet again. Then she started going into details about things that I didn't understand. She told me she has ADHD. I asked her how long she has had it and she said that her cat has been sick for a little while. She has a hard time giving me straight answers. It's been going on and is getting worse. 

As I dropped her off, she asked me what gym my sister goes to. I told her and she said she's going to text her and tell her she needs to lose weight. I told her that sometimes you can let people do things on their own. Sometimes people don't always want you to tell them they need to work out. Especially since my sister is sensitive whenever my cousin texts her. And she didn't understand what I was saying. She thought that maybe I meant that my sister needed a new gym where there are lots of buff guys. Or she asked me if she needed a cheaper gym. I slapped my face with the palm of my hands because she doesn't understand social interaction anymore. And she doesn't even understand sarcasm anymore. 

So I called up my other cousin to get more information. And unfortunately what she is going through is more than ADHD. It's something along the lines of shcizoprenia maybe. She randomly stops strangers now on the streets. She takes pictures of them and starts texting everybody these random, cryptic details about strangers we know nothing about and it's strange and doesn't make any sense. She starts talking to herself and often time thinks something is happening right in front of her when nothing is happening. She thinks her parents are stealing money from her. She constantly texts the family about new shopping deals, but in a way that doesn't make any sense. For years she was concerned about my sister and constantly emailed her new, random job opportunities. 

And she has a husband. The husband has to work full time and take care of her and the kids and at the same he goes to support groups. It must be really hard on him. I don't know what I can do to help.

She refuses to see a doctor. Without her consent, she is legally not obligated to see a doctor and take meds. So I don't understand what her husband is supposed to do. This is not a good situation. I don't see how she can get better. She seems completely lost. It's like talking to a toddler unfortunately. She was not like this before. She used to be a normal girl who was a little quiet. Now she's very hyper and doesn't make any sense. She offends people too because she shares things and is unfiltered. She doesn't realize that she offends people.

Please help give me advice, she needs a lot of help. Doesn't seem like it's in my control though. ",07Nov2017,1,
16,"I'm just having a tough time and wish someone was around right now. I have a friend I can talk to but they are asleep. This weekend I had an issue with a guy that was obviously gaslighting me, and accused me of misunderstanding him when I (and everyone I share this story with) called him on his crap. Another guy I had kind-of been seeing I think has just cut me off because I told him I was uncomfortable with his persistent sexual intimacy, even when I told him I wasn't interested or moved his hands away. He got passive aggressive since then, and is telling me I am the problem. 

I tried to tell a friend about it and they are not talking to me either, because I am bad for their mental health. I brought them dinner when they were depressed, checked in on them.... I don't know what it is about me that seems to say use me and throw me away. I don't understand what is wrong with me. I feel like I am properly assessing what is going on, but then when the other person blames me and lashes out because I told them I felt hurt by something they did, I feel so worthless and alone. 

Maybe I actually need new people in my life. Maybe I need a slap in the face. I can't tell, but it really hurts right now. ",07Nov2017,4,

25,"Hello all. First post ever on this sub so please have patience if I'm commiting any taboos.

I am writing here because I found just a month ago that a close family member of mine (based in the US) is currently experiencing a psychotic break. While I was unaware at the time, I noticed the first symptoms 6 months ago. It began with a series of stressful events at home and at work, which was followed by sick-leave and strange-sounding theories on afflictions he might have contracted but tests came back negative. 

It has now developed into full-blown conviction of being persecuted and stalked by all possible people, for a host of reasons that are all fairly unrelated (but entirely related according to him). Any glance his way while passing on the street will have him believe that he is actively being talked about, usually in the form of hate-speech. Somehow these random people on the street know every single detail about him. He actively hears them having entire conversations. I cannot delve into the details but we are talking about an entire book full of things that have happened to this person and basically everyone close to him has conspired to hide ""the truth"". It's extremely intricate. To let you understand the extent of it. If it hadn't been for sheer luck he would've gone straight up to a major politician to ask about all the things happening to him not very long ago.

I have contacted all manner of professionals that I can think of, but none of them seem able to help me. The biggest issue is that I don't have any other family to rely on to handle this and I am not even in the US, so I cannot be there physically. This person absolutely refuses any suggestions of mental illness and I am afraid that if I push harder on what ""the truth"" actually is, he will just push me away. I am now the last real person he is actually speaking with. From my understanding, american law doesn't allow taking in people against their will unless it's a 911 situation (and I am terrified of even thinking of what would involve). For now he is not violent or threatening, just entirely isolated and very fragile and scared.

Does anyone on here have any experience with this or know of how to get help for a person in this situation? His conditions seems to only get more severe with each week that passes. New theories and horrible things keep popping up constantly and any attempt to dismantle his budding delusions before they become solid just end up in arguing, which he is definitely not capable of handling (just breaks down). 

I would be immensely grateful for any insight into how best to deal with this, even if only in general terms or with anecdotes. I am at a loss and can't help but feel powerless",07Nov2017,13,

30,"Full disclaimer - My wife wrote this at her blog here: https://happyhealthyhippieco.com/blogs/news/5-ways-you-have-not-thought-of-before-to-improve-your-mood

I'm copying it below. Thought it might be a good read. Working at a corporate job, number 5 seems to work really well for me. 

**1. CHANGE YOUR EXPECTATION**

We are constantly evaluating ourselves. Am I normal? Am I happy enough? Do I (insert something here) enough? The truth is we are all different. Our individual presentation of wellness is going to look different from one another, which is why changing our expectations of our mood is a must. An example of what this might look like is accepting that we fluctuate as humans emotionally. We are not always going to be energetic, social, outgoing, killing it at work, the perfect parent, the perfect… anything. Removing this expectation is one of the most beneficial things we can do for ourselves. Give yourself permission to feel and to be.

**2. DO SOMETHING NICE FOR SOMEONE ELSE**

A quick way to get a good mood boost going and get out of your head is to put that energy into to helping another. If you’re feeling down, just think of someone in your life. Reflect on what they might be in need of in this moment. What can you do right now to make their life just a little better? Maybe you can send an encouraging message their way or you can bring them a mid-day pick me up snack. Maybe you’re at work and you let your co-worker know how much you appreciate your chats in the lunchroom or how much you dig their style. As humans we are just wired this way, put the good out, and it just comes right back. Feel good guaranteed.

**3. VISUALIZATION**

Take 5 minutes away from whatever it is you are doing. Close your eyes and notice whatever feeling it is that you are overcome with. See it as a color inside of your body - maybe it is a misty fog stealing your joy, or maybe you see it as a heavy lead like substance weighing you down. Whatever it is, visualize it in your body and notice how it’s affecting you. 

Now imagine this beautiful healing energy, in the form of a color as well, that is outside of your body. Take a deep breath and with each inhale you are taking in this healing energy. See this energy travel throughout each and every crevice of your body. It cleanses and detoxifies as it makes its way through you. With each exhale see the emotions that don’t serve you anymore leaving your body. Continue these deep breaths and continue to release anything you would like. Replace that previously occupied space with healing, self-love, and peace.

**4. HANG WITH SOMEONE'S BABY**

There is something so marvelous about the way children view the world. So simple. So beautiful. If you are feeling down and out, a great way to feel better quickly is to hang out with a little one. Sit on the floor, color, explore, get muddy, and let them tell you a story. There is no better way to become more mindful and present in the moment then to experience life as a child does. You will probably get in some really great laughs too.

**5. SCHEDULE YOUR STRESS**

This is a fun one. If you find yourself stuck in your worries or stress, set a timer for a daily block of time for you to worry your butt off for about 10 minutes. 
Yes - intentionally worry. This is a therapy technique. 

The rule is you can’t worry outside of your scheduled time.

So if you’re out of bounds take a note of your worry and don’t forget to worry about it at your next scheduled block of worry time. Another rule - if you are running out of things to worry about in your 10 minute block you have to find something to worry about to fill in your time. You’ll find that you will actually be worrying less because your “worry time” is confined to a set time each day.

Wont be able to have the same relationships that normal people do, wont be able to experience the same things normal people do. I just can't find a reason to live. I can't even hold a fucking basic job. I'm about to drop out of college because its clear I'm not capable of passing a class. The only reason I have a roof over my head is because mommy and daddy let me live there still but there about to show me the door. I can't survive in the real world.

46,"5 minutes ago, I was laying in my bed with my eyes closed. As usual, I lost touch with reality very quickly and found myself in darkness again. This darkness feels just like nothing, with no awareness of space nor time or even identity. I had always thought this was my severe depersonalisation. But today, I finally realised what it is. I have already died (my soul). It's as if I found myself again. I still do not feel like being someone, but I now know where I am. Not in my physical body - probably in the netherworld. It's sooo relieving to know what's happenening with me. I also feel like my body is perceiving itself, not I am witness to this physical reality on earth. Does anybody else genuinely believe they are dead already and experiencing this on themselves?

49,"My girlfriend suffers from major depression and self medicates with alcohol (feel free to read my history for more details) During these times she's very much caught in a spiral of despir, during which she ruminates about bad events in her past, focuses on the negative and generally spends her time thinking of things in the worse possible way, all while drinking and refusing to stop drinking. During these times she asks me to come over. If i'm busy she'll basically become passive agressive, calling herself worthless and me a bastard for not doing so until the point where i'm goaded to come over no matter what i'm doing (whether it be work or babysitting my nieces). When i do come over she'll spend the time full of self loathing and i'm essentially stuck waiting for her to pass out (as i type this she is literally next to me passed out).

My question is, what's the right thing for me to do *while* she is drunk and in this state? I feel on the one hand i should be there for her and support her, but when i go over and she's drunk she just continues to self ruminate and nothing i do or say can stop her and i know self ruminating is one of the key factors in persistant depression . So i figure maybe i shouldn't go round while she is drunk because it essentially reinforces the bad habit, but then i feel like i'm abandoning her.

She's due for couselling but stuck on a waiting list so i  terms of getting her help we're nearly there. I also don't do anything to encourage rhe drinking. I could just really do with some advice on how i should handle things while she is drunk. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance.",07Nov2017,1,
50,"Recently my anxiety has gotten worse. Mentally, and physically. Anyways, I have also been drinking more coffee beverages like lattes and mochas and things like that on a fairly regular basis. If I don't have one of those, I usually have a cup of Joe in the morning. 
When I have some sort of caffeinated coffee beverage, my anxiety isn't as bad. Is this like people with ADHD drinking coffee that it mellows them out? Does anyone else feel this way?

51,"It's difficult for me to describe my situation without this becoming a long meandering wall of text and so I hope that be listing a bunch of things I can get an outside perspective on if I have a mental illness or simply just an unhealthy way of thinking

 - Since about the age of 19 I've been content not to have any social interactions with people. I only ever leave the house for work and I hate just being out in public (walking down the street, large crowds etc). I'm not at all bothered that I have no friends (beyond a handful who are in other countries so only talk via messenger every few months).

- I've never been in a proper relationship and whilst I've forced myself to go on dates, usually by the 2nd date I start thinking 'What's the point in this?' and end up breaking it off as I find the other person too whimsical or not misanthropic enough. I've reached the point where I know I'm probably happier on my own and the only reason I went on these dates was to attempt to fill a whole I thought was there.

- I also work in higher education and I deliver seminars and lectures for groups between 15 to 200 students. I love doing this and it's one of the only things I'm really good at.

- I consider myself to be excellent at my job. I know I'm a better teacher that most in my department (I could list a bunch of anecdotal reasons but I think that I'm demonstrable good at what I do). I also tend to assume that any room I walk into I'm likely to be the smartest person in their.

- I rarely ever feel happy, yet I also never really feel sad. For example when two of my grandparents recently died it didn't seem to affect me at all. I feel as if my capacity to experience the full range of human emotion is limited.

So my problem is, I have huge anxiety being around strangers in uncontrolled environments, yet also seem to thrive when in a controlled situation where I am the one who is in control and deemed the 'important' person in the room. Am I just a bit of a miserable git or do I suffer from anxiety whilst also having narcissistic traits?

Regardless of if there's any responses, writing this out has at least had some cathartic effect.",07Nov2017,1,

53,"Now, for context. I'm an Asian-American male in a STEM major (CS). I recently made the decision to change to Business, but enough about that. This will be a bit of a long read, but I'll put a TLDR at the end.

For as long as I can remember, I've had feelings of anxiety, depression, and semi-suicidal thoughts, among other things. They've been building for years now, and I kept quiet because I thought that I would look weak for choosing or even wanting to go to therapy.

I think some parts of my childhood contributed to a lot of my current feelings. From infancy to the age of 7, it was customary for my parents to fight on weekends. Imagine, a young child, supposed to worry about how many pancakes he'll be able to eat on Saturday, having to worry about his mother and father screaming at each other, throwing things, threatening for divorce, etc. It SUCKED. Even now, I still do this thing when I'm home where I gauge how they are with one another. I hated seeing them fight when I was a kid, it really hurt me. I knew and know that they love me, but I was just so fearful of them drifting away from each other. One time, my mom walked out of our apartment, and I had to chase after her, crying. Another time, my dad dropped her off in a parking lot with me in the back, and told her, ""Have a nice life."". I started crying on the spot. My sister never had to see it as much; they really lessened their arguments after her birth.

My main feelings of depression and anxiety started in my sophomore or junior year in high school. I wasn't exactly in the best position academically at the time due to some friend problems that really hit me hard. Toward the end of sophomore year, I started questioning if it was good that I was born, primarily because my academics weren't going well and I had grown distant from people who I thought were my friends.  In addition, I asked these questions internally because I felt like me (and my sister being born) were the only things keeping their marriage together. There were a lot of instances where my mother and father told me that I was just a cross to bear, but that was mainly because they were angry for things I said or did. 

The summer after my sophomore year, I think I remember June 2015 more for sleeping than anything else. I just felt so angry at myself and tired and lonely that I curled up on my basement couch and snuggled under a blanket. I only got up to eat, shower, use the bathroom, or work out (occasionally). I was a lot more irritable. I was very high strung, due to falling outs that I had with ""friends"" and my grades sinking, and I took out my anger (vocally) onto my family. After a month, I got up (since I had SAT/ACT prep and tennis offseason) and told myself that I had to get my shit together. It worked that year, I moved higher up on the tennis team's ladder, my grades improved, things were good. And then I got one B on my junior year report card. One B out of several As. The depression hit again; I felt like a fuck-up. But I wanted to slay the next year of high school.

My senior year was more known for the extreme falling out I had with a friend. This same friend was a source of anger and trouble for me in my sophomore year. He wanted my help for college apps and academics. Now, me being more of a yes man than I should be, I said 'yes'. But then, I started thinking harder about if it was the right move; hey, he could turn on me, fuck me over or something. So I decided to shift away from him. He noticed, and retaliated strongly. He told ANOTHER friend of mine some lie about me wanting to kill him, and I lost this person's friendship. I had had enough, I wanted to cut him off for good, away from me. But he didn't get it; he followed me around, tried to sit next to me everywhere. Because of this, for most of my senor year, I was angry. I would wake up angry some days, go to bed angry. Wake up sad some days, go to bed sad some days. It grew really hard having to wake up in the morning, knowing I had to go to school and deal with him. All the while, I got into 10/15 schools, got two scholarships to one of them, and am attending that one now (Fuck Michigan. :P). Eventually, he stopped after I raised my voice to him one day. We never spoke again, but after senior year, and even during the summer, I felt really insecure about the whole thing. I thought he was trying to throw subtle jabs and disrespectful remarks my way whenever we saw each other, and I thought he wanted to fight me. So, what did I do but work out like crazy, lose a lot of weight, gain some muscle, etc. I think it was more obsessive than anything, to be honest.

Now, to the main part:

I attend a good college near the Midwestern US. I started school in mid-August. Now, like all freshmen, I missed home a lot. My family built such a good home life for me in recent years, that I was too adjusted to and comfortable with. Now, I say missed, but I mean to say ""miss"". I miss it a lot. I miss driving my car, seeing my friends, sleeping in my bed, etc. It's put me in bad spells this semester, where it's really hard to get out of bed in the morning.

I can't trace back to when this first started happening, but lately, I think I've had more concrete suicidal thoughts. Like, before going to a math recitation, I went to the bathroom, and looked at the courtyard below. I thought, ""Man, it would be so easy to jump down and end it all right here."". Today, after a less than ideal Engineering midterm (probably failed), I thought about how easy it would be to go back to my room, take a lot of pills, and end my life. These thoughts have been cutting into me lately. I had these thoughts when I had my math midterm, when I did my CS midterm yesterday, and even today with my engineering one. They've just been ramping up even more and more with each passing day, and I'm scared now.

I've gone to see counseling, I do group therapy and one-on-one, but it isn't enough. It doesn't feel like enough. Plus, I'm so worried about my slipping grades too, so that's been adding to my self-loathing and thoughts of ending it. I feel like I study a lot, try to learn (not just memorize), but when it comes time to step up to the plate, I blank and mess things up now. 

In addition, I may have an attention problem of some kind. I see the tasks I need to do, I make a plan for it, but then the plan goes to shit and doesn't get followed. I get easily distracted by things near me or around me, and it's hard to put my phone away. Plus, I've exhibited some compulsive behavior as well, such as checking my grades over and over to see if assignments have come in, even if they haven't yet or if I just took them that day. 

Last, I think another problem is that I just never wanted to study CS. I primarily picked it up to make my parents happy. All I've ever wanted was to make them happy and proud of me. If I had chosen business, I would be a direct admit right now, which makes me regret choosing CS. I think this also adds to my depression, knowing that a better choice existed for me but I didn't take it. CS, and engineering in general here, feels really gloomy. No instructor, TA, or anyone seems happy, whereas the people I've met over in the business school are seemingly so driven and animated in how they do things. 

So, here's where my big question comes in:
is a leave of absence the right move? If I'm really having this much anxiety, depression, and this many suicidal thoughts, and if counseling isn't helping here, AND if my grades are declining because of these things, would a leave of absence be the right move? I think these things have been building for years, and the time when they burst out most for people (college) is hurting it more. I never talked about it all those years because I was afraid and felt weak for even considering going to therapy, and I feared disappointing or embarrassing my parents.

My idea is to go back home for this semester, and come back next semester with a better handle on my issues. I've called the financial aid office already about how this might affect my scholarship, and have talked to my academic advisor already about it. My advisor has given me the forms needed to petition for a leave of absence. 

TLDR: Have had semi-suicidal/existential thoughts, depressive feelings, and anxiety in the past, seems to have ramped up in college as well, but to the point where my thoughts of suicide are more concrete. Have also exhibited obsessive and attention problems that may have gone unnoticed by many. Grades are slipping, and I don't feel happy at this time with what I do or am doing.",07Nov2017,1,
54,"My local doctor / family doctor (in from Central Europe, so maybe that's not the right word? It's just a basic doctor, not specialised in anything.) has said sign hanging where the receptionists sit. I'm sure it's supposed to be a joke hinting at the 'madness' that is going down there everyday since doctor's offices are always very busy. 
Since I just pick up my prescriptions there every month I don't have much to do with them. 

Now I'm wondering weather I should say something about it though, since it doesn't contribute anything positive to mental health awereness and to be honest- I am kinda hurt by the ignorance, especially at a doctor's office. As a patient suffering from mental health issues it just seems intensive and actually somehow pisses me off. It makes me feel like neither me nor my conditions are being taken seriously.

Am I overreacting about it? Would you say something or do you think a sign like that is appropriate and just meant to be fun?
