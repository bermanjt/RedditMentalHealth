0,"So, I've always had obsessive thoughts. But ever since this year I've stopped thinking of them and just think of nothing all day. It's strange because I've had obsessive thoughts all my life.
I read a thread on Reddit where someone was complaining about them getting obsessed, which interested me. Someone on that thread said SSRIs stop obsession, and I saw that Prozac is an SSRI, do you think this caused my lack of interest in things I once enjoyed and made me stop having obsessive thoughts? Has anyone else experienced something like this? I figured this would be the best place to ask.",27Jan2017,1,

4,"I'm really damn pissed.
I was playing Overwatch and was trying to get some lootboxes to get the rooster skins and whatever, and for the last 3 hours I got crappy teams (some were OK but the enemy team were really good). I got really angry and told my friend about it. He didn't help because he was acting like an asshole. In fact, he just made me more pissed.
I want to get my anger out before I bicycle kick the screaming kids across the road from me with steel capped boots.
And before you answer, don't tell me to exercise or do any calming crap like reading a book or listening to calming music. I AM THIS CLOSE TO PUNCHING A HOLE IN MY ESOPHAGUS WITH A BLUNT PENCIL.

Any helpful comments would be greatly appreciated

5,"I recently ended a relationship of three and a half years. I do not love him, I'm not sure if I ever did, and I literally don't feel upset at all. Might be dissasociation but I'm not sure. So I might care somewhere and not be able to tell. Anyway, when I met a new person it is very easy for me to divulge very personal things about myself and deeply connect with them, but now after multiple LTRs I realize that after a period of time I become secretive, closed off, self conscious, and insecure. Why am I like this? I feel like my feelings going through a reverse progression. Can anyone else shed some light on this or relate at all? ",27Jan2017,2,
6,"Hello Reddit! I am putting feelers out to see if anyone would be interested in using a site that I am thinking of creating. I want to create a site that contains informational resources for mental health issues, victims of abuse, and other related topics. This site would also contain a forum so that people can share their stories and chat with others on the various topics listed. I myself have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and am a victim of emotional abuse. I know their are many communities to connect with others and websites with helpful information for those seeking help. However, I have never felt completely satisfied with the communities I have found. I feel that it is hard to find a place with a sense of community and well as informational for those seeking help. Also, I would create the site to be an anonymous place where people feel safe, regardless of their situation to share and seek help. If this sounds like something that would be beneficial or if you would be interesting in being a part of that type of community, please leave a comment.

Thanks,

8,"I just recently feeling socially isolated. I'm at my second semester of college and feel like I don't have anyone close. I don't have many close friends to begin with so talking to someone about my thoughts puts me on edge - like I don't feel comfortable doing so. I have a friend group but I don't know them on a deeper level yet. Tonight in particular, I feared social interaction and confrontation and I don't have any idea why. I put on my flannel and jacket and decided to walk 3 miles round trip. I live in Southern California so it wasn't freezing but it was windy. I listened to music and thought about my life and found myself so confused. I didn't know why I continued to walk nor why I cried. My mental health has never been the best but this was a shock even to me. I've always dealt with something but nothing to the point where I thought there was something ""wrong"" with me. I came back only because I friend asked me where I was - as I replied ""I don't really know."" I ran into some friends in my dorm building and felt very anxious and I'm pretty sure they caught on. I just don't know how to access what just happened tonight but if someone could help that'd be great.",27Jan2017,2,

10,"2012 I had my first psychosis after being over religious for a while. I started to hear God's voice and one time I even thought that I was the Holy Spirit. 2013 I had the second psychosis. I was a zombie on the medicine I got and gained weight which sucks. In the end of 2016 I had my third and hopefully my last psychosis and it was hell. I saw colors in things and saw and heard spirits trying to possess me and I had not enough insight to know something was wrong so I was totally confused. I did not know that I had a psychosis and did not even quite understand that I was in a mental hospital. Things got really weird and I felt that the whole world around me was rotting or reset. At the same time I thought that the thousand year reign would begin - at least that it was time for a big change. I was feeling and seeing all these things, like I was being controlled and monitored, and that I had some kind of important role given by God but that I could not quite figure out what it was. Humor and better medicine for me than back in 2012 and 2013 saved me. I am well.

11,"I don’t know about everyone else, but when I am in a down mental state , I have a tendency to believe that my entire past has always been that way.

When I am depressed, I feel like I have always been depressed. When my anxiety levels are high, I feel like they have always been high.

In those moments, I struggle to even think that I will ever get better. Not only do I have to fight for the motivation to heal, but also for the belief that it is actually even possible to heal in the first place.

In order to combat this, I wrote for myself a ‘mental health checklist’ with the words under it saying: “these have helped you in the past and they will help you again”

Then I list some things that have worked for me to get me to a better place. Typically they are things that force me out of my head and into the present.

EG: Exercise, Cold showers, Writing, Meditating as well as asking myself ‘are my thoughts logical? And am I physiologically fine (eg: am I hungry/tired?). 

This has helped me a bunch and it may for you. 
To clarify, I am not saying to do what I do, rather find your own. Also, this is to help when my general mood drops/mental health issues play up – like a mental health first aid. If something major happens I am straight to the psychologist.

I share this because it took me ages to realise that I could be taking steps to get better quicker, and I want to show others that as well

I talk about this in depth here (podcast talk): http://www.zachary-phillips.com/realitycheck/e011

14,"My parents are both at work; I have the house to myself. I bought the rope from a climbing goods shop, so it will be strong enough, it won't break. I don't want my mom to find me; she wouldn’t be able to cope. My dad is strong though and I know he'll protect my mom from the worst of it.

So I take my rope to the garage, where he'll find me, and tie it around one of the beams in the ceiling. I climb up on a step ladder that I can kick away easily, and wrap the rope around my neck. I haven't left a note, there's nothing to say. I thought I might chicken out, I might have second thoughts, but now I'm up here I'm surer than ever. Confident even, that this will release me from the pain I've been feeling. I kick the ladder away.

At first it just hurts. More than I expected. I think I expected to just peacefully drift off, but there's nothing peaceful about this. Even though I'm content with my decision, my body has other ideas and it starts to convulse. I find my hands grasping at the rope, at my neck trying to create some space for air to pass. I can't stop them.

It feels less painful as the seconds pass and my vision gets blurry and tunnels. My thoughts race to memories I didn't know I had, but I can't focus on them; maybe they are trying to find something to change my mind, something to make me fight this. But there's nothing there. My life hasn't been terrible. I have loving parents who tried their best. I was never abused or anything. But there was nothing remarkable either, nothing I would miss. I'm just an average person in an average life, and it's not enough. In the next few seconds it stops hurting. I can't see the garage around me anymore, just black. I have a high pitched ringing in my ears and I can't feel my fingers or any part of me. I certainly can't move them. Even if I changed my mind, I was beyond the point of no return. Only a couple more seconds and I'm done with this life. Black, silence. I pass out.

I open what I think are my eyes, but when I try to look down at my body it isn't there. Nothing is there, just emptiness and darkness. A dimmer brings up the light and I'm in a square grey room, cold and silent. I still don't have a body, but I can look around. I spin to see if there is a way out. When my vision gets back to where it started, there is a desk, with me sitting behind it. I'm wearing red, I don't wear red.

""What the fuck do you think you're doing?"" I shout at myself, ""there are people in this world who are really suffering; from war, famine, loss and they don't try and take the pussy's way out. And you, you fucking fairy, what's so bad about your life anyway? You have a family that loves you, a job, and a roof over your head. What's so terrible about that?""

Before I can respond the desk is bigger, there is a second chair there now and a second me. I'm wearing blue.

""You couldn't possibly understand."" Blue Me says, turning to face Red Me. ""My life isn't some tragedy, some terrible drama, no. But it's something worse, it's unimportant. If I had some adversity in my life it may have taught me to fight, to carry on. But I don't. It feels like life is just happening to me, I'm not living it. Nothing feels important. So if I have nothing to fight against, nothing to fight for; what's the point?""

I try to speak; I want to tell Red Me that he has no idea what he is saying. That just because you aren't suffering, doesn't mean you have anything to live for. But I can't speak, I can see and hear, but I can't speak. It seems like Blue Me gets it though.

""I'm not in an abusive relationship, I am not a refugee, I haven't been attacked for my beliefs, I am not suffering a disability and I am not hiding childhood trauma. My life is perfectly average and normal. And apathy is driving me out of my mind. If all I have to look forward to in this life is going to work for forty years and then dying, I'd rather just skip the work part."" Says Blue Me, seeming very tired.

""But what about your parents?"" Screams Red Me. ""They will be crushed, devastated if you weren't around anymore. What about your friends who love you? All of their worlds would be darker if you weren't in them.""

""So you're only argument for me living is that it stops other people being sad?"" replies Blue Me. ""You didn't even argue that I make those people happy, just that it would make them sad if I died. So my life in itself has no value. It doesn't matter that I'm not happy, that my life is dull and painful to me. It doesn't matter as long as I don't upset other people. So my disappointment in the life I have, is less important than their sadness? Your argument is based around what's best for other people, not what's best for me.""

""It's not up to you anyway, or me, it's up to him."" says Red Me as he looks down the longer table to a third seat. Sitting in the seat is me, but a Shadow Me. I can barely see him, but I know he's there. And when Shadow Me speaks, I don't hear him with my ears, I feel his words. 

""So you want to die?"" he says, it feels like he is looking into my mind as he stares at me with his shadow eyes. ""You are in pain, I can feel it. Being in pain is preventing you from feeling the good in the world. Blue is correct; nothing feels good in your life and nothing feels bad. It's left you with a feeling of nothingness. And what is the point in life if you feel nothing?""
  He looks down the table at Red Me, ""he is correct as well. Your life isn't terrible; you haven't suffered tragedy so there is always hope of repair. Your life is empty right now, but it hasn't always been and won’t always be. He brings up your friends and family, not because their feelings are more important than yours, but because once upon a time, their companionship made you happy. There has been no great rift; there is nothing that needs to be fixed. So there is hope that it can be enough again.""

I find my voice for the first time in this place. ""I'm tired of feeling numb.""

""I know."" Says Shadow Me, ""but you are capable of feeling. The mechanism may be damaged, but it is not completely broken. If you are in a beautiful garden and you hit your toe on a rock; all you feel is the pain and you no longer see the flowers. It doesn't mean the flowers are gone though, simply that you have lost the ability to see them. Once the pain subsides the flowers will return to view, and you will see beauty again. Your numb feelings and loneliness in this world are preventing you from seeing anything good, but it's a short term situation. The good things are still there and eventually you will remember how to see them, how to feel them.""

Shadow Me looks at Red Me who simply nods in agreement. He looks at Blue Me who looks away. 

""It's settled then."" says Shadow Me in a commanding voice and Red Me and Blue Me are no longer in the room. The table is small with one chair and in it sits me. Just me.

""This might seem like the only way out..."" Complete Me says, ""But there is another way. You think we don't have anything to fight for but you're wrong. Fight for the fact that there are cool, beautiful, awesome things in this world that we haven't seen or experienced yet. Fight for your happiness, rather than accepting that it's gone forever. Fight.""

Someone turns down the lights, the pain returns in my neck and now my back and my backside hurt as well. As my eyes start to regain their focus I can see the beam in the garage ceiling with half of the rope still tied to it. My numb hands reach for my neck, this time I want them to, and they find the other half of the rope. It snapped.

15,"I've always been into comic books, I have been since I was child I have a bookcase full of my constantly growing collection of graphic novels it's been my favourite escape for as long as I can remember. The other day I saw a graphic novel that really took my interest in a Waterstones, but decided I would leave it there for the time being because I've been short on cash being recent graduate with no job. A couple days later I ordered a pizza with my girlfriend and paid for it and in return for buying her food she offered to take me back to Waterstones and buy me the book using the discount she gets for working at another Waterstones elsewhere, I took her up on the offer and the next day (today as of writing this) we went to the Waterstones to pick it up... when we got there I saw a rather large bloke stood in the graphic novel section holding the only copy of the one I wanted, at first I was really annoyed but I browsed other sections of the shop waiting and hoping he'd put it back on the shelf... he did not, he bought it and left now this shattered my mood, my girlfriend offered to buy me a different graphic novel from the shelf as there were many that were needed for my collection, but I stood there totally disheartened and now didn't want any of the graphic novels on the shelf in front of me I wanted the one that that big bloke had taken from me. Now I'm from Wigan where men tend to pride themselves on being men and I was now furious at my self for being so childish and throwing an internal paddy over a fucking comic book, I felt like an idiot but no matter how hard I tried scanning the shelves for another option I couldn't escape the thought ""I don't want any of these I want that one!""

17,"I think my sister may have a mental problem. She is only 10(going to turn 11 in march.) but, she is driving me insane. Let me just give you a little background. I'm the oldest of 4 girls with our ages being 16, 12 (turning 13 in March) 10 (turning 11 in March), and 9. All the rest of us don't have any problems, except the twelve year old has mild O.C.D. And I get that little sisters can be annoying, but she is way past that. She is a nightmare.

My sister has narcissistic traits. She thinks she's more entitled to things than other people are. For example: We are currently in the middle of moving, and my dad offered to let whoever wanted to come live in the house early with him to come. He mentioned to my sister (we'll call her L) that if neither me or my other sister came then he would have to purchase her a cellphone. That way if she misses the bus to our new school she could call him. Well, in her mind that meant that she was entitled to the brand new IPhone 7 and she tried convincing my other sister not to come to the new house. An argument ensued between them to the point of L belittling my other sister into tears. Finally I  butted in and asked L, ""So is a cellphone really more important than your own sister's happiness?"" She began screaming at me, ""MY HAPPINESS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HER'S! I WANT THAT NEW IPHONE! SHE WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT!"" Now, we can by no means afford a brand new iPhone and she knows that. Hell, we can barely afford our house. I mean, yeah my parents and I have the 6s but we are in a 2 year contract. My other sister has a 5s, but only because our grandpa died. Whenever the subject of a cellphone comes up she ends up screaming and belittling people every time.

L can never be wrong either. Or take criticism. If we try to correct her on something it ends up in a screaming match with someone getting hurt. If we tell her that she did a math problem wrong, she'll argue for hours on end with us about how she did it right. Then once you do prove her wrong, if by the rare chance she accepts it, she'll lie and say that we were wrong the whole time. If I tell her that I have homework to do or a book to read, she'll claim she's already done that type of math and it's easy or that she's already read that book a thousand times. When I call her out on it she screams at me. It's never ending with her.

L lies a lot and is lazy. She lies to make herself seem better than other people and to seem innocent. She hit my younger sister and when my mom yells at her for it she denies it. Even though L did it right in front of her eyes. She'll often try to twist stories around and thinks that constantly repeating a command will make you do it. Like when we were on a rode trip and she wanted the front seat. I had been sitting there for about 30 mins and she asks me if I want to switch seats. I told her no. She then started repeating. ""Switch me seats. Switch me seats. Switch me seats.""  For about 15 mins. After I ignored her the whole time she proceeded to yell in my face, ""YOU WILL SWITCH ME SEATS!"" I calmly told her if she got in my face again she'd loose her teeth. That shut her up real quick. 

What happened today is what made me write this. This incident made me think she has a real problem. While I was grabbing something to eat, she slammed a perfectly good apple on the ground. When I asked her why she did that she, of course, denied it. I told her I saw her do it right in front of my eyes. She got in my face and screamed, ""IT ROLLED OFF THE COUNTER YOU IDIOT!!!"" I told her she had 2 seconds to get out of my face. She then proceeded to hit me in the face. And what happened next, I'm not very proud of. I usually walk away, but this really drew the line for me. I smacked her into tomorrow. That hurt my hand. She was kinda stunned for a second then she pushed me into the wall. I grabbed her hair and started beating her. At the time, I was so mad I didn't know what I was doing. My grandmother had to pull me off of her. She didn't cry until my grandmother got there. Then L tried to lie and said that I hit her in the face first for no reason. And now that I think about it, I'm glad that I beat the crap out of her. I know a 16 year old beating up a 10 year old sounds bad, but I'm done with her bull crap. I'm tired of L beating on my 9 year old sister because she is smaller. But, when I step up to her, she turns into a coward. 

I don't know what to do with her anymore. Neither do my parents. They've tried spankings, groundings, and pretty much anything. Nothing has worked. I came to this subreddit because, I thought you guys would know what's wrong with her. I think she has a mental problem.

18,"Quick summary: Scientist, in a highly regulated environment, living with clinical depression and anxiety. Medicated: Sertraline, 75mg/day, taken by alternating taking 1 and 2 50mg tablets a day. Have been on this regime for years, but I can be terrible at remembering to take my meds.

Newish in my company, but came in as an experienced scientist. Have made a couple of mistakes that have resulted in a shit ton of paperwork and large formal ""what went wrong, why, what can we do, what will we do"" procedures. Nothing too major and it was all picked up timely as is procedure but they were largely due to lapses in memory/focus on my part.

It's getting noticed by my higher ups (who were nice about it) and quite frankly I've noticed a decrease in performance myself. I do try, promise, but when making a conscious effort to focus my band of focus can be quite narrow, and I inevitably miss out bits of a procedure I should also follow. 

I've also noticed an increase in ""quirks"" at home: aversions to touch with certain types of fabrics (also can't stand when SO drags his bare or socked feet on our rugs or carpets), aversions to sounds (metal on ceramic, something that was on at a normal volume then becoming painful to listen to), etc.

I've noticed my memory getting slowly worse over the past year and I'm not sure if it's a by - product of the mentalness, side effect of Sertraline, mild withdraw whenever I miss said Sertraline,  or something else entirely. Or if I'm wide off the mark and I have no real decrease in memory and focus,  and I just have it in my head that I do.

I don't even know if this is worthy of bothering my GP. I can never quite articulate what goes on in my head well until I have tangible episodes.

Thoughts? Experiences?  Is this a genuine thing I can bother my doc about or is it all (for want of a better phrase) in my head?

19,"We all are quite aware that depression sucks. I hurts mentally and physically. It can take everything away and make life monotone. It can look like a bright smile or an emaciated stare. It's all unique. 

Sometimes, it is made worse by those we love the most. Not everyone can understand how depression feels. The isolation of being depressed can't be empirically validated. 

When you have a loved one that can't accept that you are different from them, it creates an insurmountable wall. When someone is raised not to share their feelings or fears, it's even worse. The walls are so high, that moments of happiness just seem like illusions put out by people manipulating you for their own ends. 

From nurture, walls are built to shape a person's reality. It becomes solitary confinement of the mind and spirit. 
Any misstep or glance over this wall is met with contempt and abuse. Through operant conditioning, the individual in question learns not to dream, disagree or rebel. Everything that they know tells them that they will lose everything, and they will be less than the nothing they felt they were before. 

Real emotional abuse can turn into self abuse, strengthening the cycle of self loathing and mental reliance on others. Every word from another's lips becomes life or death. Positive feedback only pulls someone through for a passing moment. Negative feedback carries for days, weeks, months, years...

This is what twenty or more years of constant mental abuse can do to a person. It is made more painful when diagnosable physical and hormonal needs are never treated. 

Friends leave, or do not want to understand because of their own personal needs. No one can be trusted, because when the issues are discussed, it's suddenly an attack on them. It becomes all their fault, because you can't normally talk about these things until it is making every joint in your body ache. 

Thus, with silence do the isolated live their lives.",27Jan2017,1,
20,"It's not surprising to me, but I recently had the sudden realization that I've developed trust issues and it's affecting my ability to connect with people. I'm a person that genuinely believes that people almost never try to be cruel, and are generally looking out for their own interests (as we all should be within reason). But somewhere along the way, I seemed to have lost the 'spark' I used to have when meeting people and connecting with my friends. Anybody have experience with this? Yes, I'm going to therapy, next appointment is in 3 weeks. Advice, general or personalized is appreciated.

Background:

I'll try to keep this short, just wanted to provide some context. 30/M. I have depression, which I'm sure factors into it. It's definitely affecting me right now but I've been doing a great job of keeping myself busy and not dropping too low. Over the last 6 years or so, I've had a long string of instances where close friends of mine have ghosted/semi-ghosted on me seemingly out of nowhere. It's something I'm sensitive to, but until recently it hasn't affected my ability to connect with new people.

The last year in particular was especially hard, with...

*Best friend of ~8 months more or less stopped talking to me. When we started actually talking-talking we had a serious conversation about these issues I've had in the past, and she expressed having similar issues and vehemently agreed with me that communication was key. Made 3 very strong attempts to talk to her about what was going on before eventually giving up. Later found out she was overwhelmed and depressed, but she basically ignored me for 4 months.

*New friend I got close to, really hit it off with after a month or so. 4 months later, she moves halfway across the country. Absolutely the right decision for her and I don't begrudge her moving

*New person I started dating for about 3 months started withdrawing, eventually said she couldn't date right now because of some (genuinely life-consuming) external circumstances. Basically said that if in a few months I was still interested she'd still like to see me. Did so a few months later, she recently started dating someone else. Long story short I know for a fact that she didn't break up with me to date the other guy.

*Another new friend, wasn't super close - moved about 3 hours away after being friends for ~6 months. ",27Jan2017,2,

I stopped taking my birth control two months ago and I've noticed I'm not taking four hour naps on top of ten hours of sleep at night &amp; I'm not eating two pints of ice cream plus whatever else I can get on my hands on in a day. But I still don't feel ""right"" if that makes sense. 
Five years ago I was running 5Ks, lifting weights at the gym, and doing yoga. I ate a strict, healthy diet and I felt good. I still had some low periods out of the blue, something I've always suffered with, but it was manageable. I was never Barbie, but I did make an effort to dress in a way I thought looked good. I was 21, making minimum wage &amp; had no idea what to major in for college but I felt less stressed and definitely happier. ",27Jan2017,1,

But this demon is basically her concise and it almost controls her emotions. She's said in the past that its almost like someone is looking over her shoulder. I don't know how to help her or even what's causing this and I just need some help. ",27Jan2017,1,

32,"Hi everyone!

For the life of me, I can't remember if I saw this post on /r/mentalhealth or /r/bpd... or maybe on a different subreddit altogether.

Pretty much it was an article discussing a disorder (or syndrome?) when people inconsistently take their meds.  For example, they would take meds for months, or years, then abruptly stop for no reason.  This relates a lot to me, and I would like to bring it up with my Psychiatrist tomorrow... I just thought it would help if I could put a name to it.

Thanks for all your help!  I greatly appreciate it.

Edit: Just saw this post says it's an ""announcement"".  How can I change it?  Sorry, I'm a newbie.",27Jan2017,1,

35,"Hello,
I would like to read some stories of paths people took to getting help for depression, SAD, PMS, PMDD or any other closely related diagnosis I don't know about. I have never been seen by a mental health professional but many days wonder if it would be helpful. I also have no idea where to begin and worry that I could potentially spend a lot of money see a lot of doctors or therapists and simply be deemed, ""fine,"" or be told it's all in my head.

37,"Okay so I'm dx c-ptsd, and possibly bipolar or borderline (Drs not sure yet!) I exhibit all borderline symptoms just not enough at one time for long enough? IDK i trust her judgement though and we just focus on my symptoms not so much the label....

Anyways lately I've really noticed that I get WAY too excited about things... like tonight I have plans to go see some bands with my friend and I feel so hyper just thinking about it and I have actually been sweating all day because my heart rate is so high. I LOVE going out and looking good (I feel extra confident when this happens). Does this happen to anyone else?

I've been this way my whole life but I think it's become a not so good thing as I get older... like I get really impulsive when I feel like this. Usually drink too much, do drugs, cheat, I'm an incredible flirt.

I'm mostly just wondering why this happens and what it is.... I see my doc soon so I will talk to her but idk how to calm myself down in the meantime!",27Jan2017,2,
38,"A long time ago, I struggled with some sort of mental affliction that I can only compare to multiple personality disorder. I am very curious as to what exactly I experienced, and I'm looking for some answers. The first sign was when I was a little kid, probably as young as 3 years old. Every so often I would feel as though I sensed some kind of change within my brain. As if my neurochemistry became shuffled every few months. 

The next significant event I can remember is, one day I was lying in bed trying to go to sleep when the strangest realization hit me, right around a time when I was beginning to deal with some depersonalization: ""How do I know that my consciousness as it exists now, will still exist tomorrow when I wake up? How do I know that 'I' will wake up in my body tomorrow? How do I know that every night, my brain doesn't completely reset? How do I know that I'm the same 'me' after I wake up? Is it possible that I just think I'm the same person I was yesterday?""

I then began to develop a phobia of falling asleep. I was already suffering with extensive mental illness at the time. Then, one day, I woke up and it wasn't ""me"".

I had all of my memories. I remembered my relationships with people, but I felt no emotional attachment. I remembered my likes and dislikes, but they were meaningless to me. I remembered the things I had been thinking about the day before, but I did not identify those things as ""my thoughts"". It was like looking through an entirely different lense of emotions. Then, over time I started to have difficulty remembering all of these things. I had a genuine fear of losing myself on a very literal level.

This may have been my dissociation, I'm not entirely sure, but at some point I would have these rushes of emotions flooding through my head, like racing thoughts x10, and they would last for hours. I did not recognize these emotions as my own, and I was very confused as to why I was feeling them. My mental fortitude began to shatter, and suddenly, I had become something called ""arcaes"". It's not like he had a voice of his own. He was me, and I was him, but when I was him, his emotions were the only thing that mattered to me. That's a poor way of describing it, but it's the closest I can get.

Arcaes spoke in eloquent poems which I could not normally write. He was something like a sociopath. He had no concern for my friends. He had no concern for my reputation. In front of my mom, he/I would pretend I was normal. At school, he would constantly display narcissistic thoughts like ""Everyone around me is completely retarded. They may as well be slugs."" despite my extremely low self esteem. When he came around, I could feel the dopamine flowing through my brain as if I were on drugs or something. It was like his emotions took priority over mine. I was still there, watching all of this, but I was incapable of opposition.

I am the type of person who was always painfully overly empathetic. For example when I was a little kid, I would cry every time I accidentally stepped on a bug. Arcaes, however, had different ideas. Before I conquered this illness of mine, I attempted a murder-suicide (thank goodness I failed). That was when I realized that there was something SERIOUSLY wrong with me. I went to a mental hospital and lied to the doctors. I decided I would have to deal with this on my own. Through trial and error I discovered no amount of therapy would help this grave glitch my brain seemed to latch onto. I was able to cure myself through meditation and intense self-reflection, among other things. Does anyone have any idea what in the world happened to me?",27Jan2017,1,
39,"So.....To me my biggest problem in life is being able to fit into modern society.I try to become friends with people who like what I like and all of that BUT...I have a problem. I have been diagnosed with social anxeity and depression.whenever I am out in public,I feel like I loose all sense of direction and feel like everyone is watching my every move and I panic that in I will mess something up and for somereason, i can never Comprehend everything peoplease say to in public either,I either just nod or laugh when I didn't understand what the other person said.Now,I don't seem to have this problem around close family members but only when meeting new people or just generally out in public.(someone please tell me what this is so I can try to resolve this,it's part of my resolution).Another thing,when I am sitting in college and hear everyone else talking to people,I get discouraged in my head and start calling myself useless and a failure because I have no friends at all and i can hardly initiate a conversation with anyone let alone keep it going. I also only leave the house for work,school,appointments etc.but when I do try to go out,I just can't force myself to start conversations or stop myself from feeling useless in public.Please list some things below you would do or suggest to me, in order to hopefully improve.Feels good to just...rant and let out your worries like this so,thanks for reading!
