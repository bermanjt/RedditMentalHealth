0,"(I'm new to reddit, please be kind.)

I live in a Canadian city. My diagnoses are PTSD, Depression, and BPD (that one doesn't seem entirely accurate -- complex PTSD is probably more accurate, but officially it doesn't exist, so...). I've been too unwell to work for the past year and a half, and I am a patient at a community mental health team. The team mostly sees people with psychosis and mood disorders, and your mental illness has to be considered severe for you to become a patient there. My first experiences with mental health care were when I was 14, I'm now more than twice that age, and I'm frustrated by the difficulty of accessing appropriate care and by my lack of progress, particularly in the past few years, when my mental health has worsened despite my efforts.

For the past few months, I've been working with an occupational therapist at the mental health team. Mostly because I'm what my OT referred to as ""occupationally disengaged"" - that is, I don't do much of anything / have any kind of meaningful activity in my life. At my appointment earlier this week, my OT tried to get me to do a CBT thought record. (Sidenote: I'm not entirely sure why, since this doesn't seem super related to occupational therapy / working on my ""occupational disengagement""?)

I dissociated. As part of this, it became very difficult for me to speak or move my limbs (not sure how common this is for other people who experience dissociation, but it's happened to me a number of times). My OT had a really hard time understanding what I was experiencing. I told her nothing was real, but she didn't understand what I meant. She kept coming up with all these different (more intellectual? less literal?) interpretations for what I might have meant by ""nothing is real"" but none of them were anywhere close to what I meant. I was trying my best to explain, but I was also going in and out of being able to speak. At some point, she told me she couldn't read my mind. I started hyperventilating and had a full-on panic attack. 

When I was able to breathe enough to talk, I remember saying to the OT: ""you don't know how to help me"". I said this because she did nothing to help me when I had the panic attack and still didn't seem to understand that I was dissociating. 

She said something about how it wasn't her job to help me, that her role was to present me with [tools? techniques? not sure what word she used] that I could decide whether or not to use. (This seemed like an odd comment, because, for one, I've never turned down anything she's suggested without trying it. I sometimes express concerns about whether I am *able* to do something, but I don't think I've been reluctant to try out her suggestions.) She told me I didn't have to see her, that I could see a different OT or no OT at all. 

None of this was what I wanted. I'm still confused by it and not sure what to make of it. I'm looking for other people's perspectives on what happened. 

Is it too much for me to expect an OT working in mental health to know what dissociation is and to be able to recognize it when it's happening? I get that it's difficult to understand what someone is experiencing when they're finding it difficult to communicate verbally, but even after I said ""nothing is real"", she didn't get it.

Is it true that an OT's job isn't to help patients/clients? 
If occupational therapy isn't supposed to help the patient/client, what's the point of it?

Should I keep working with this OT? It used to be that I would look forward to seeing her, but now I'm worried that she's out of her depth when it comes to my mental health. I'm sad about this and I don't know what to do.

Also, this happened on Tuesday and I still haven't been able to regain my connection with reality. I did some grounding exercises yesterday with my case manager, but nothing seems to be helping. Since this is now day 5, I'm starting to feel like this is my new normal, which is distressing. I've never dissociated for this long before, and it's also been more severe than I'm used to. I'm concerned about my safety, but I can't think of anything to do that would be useful. I don't have anyone to talk to and the only option I can think of would be to go to a hospital, but I've spent so much time in hospitals and I know that I only get worse in that environment (being confined/restricted to an environment where other people have total power over me majorly triggers my PTSD).

1,"Bit of background. Im 28M and divorced. Found out my wife was having an affair and it turned out not to be the first. Ive always had on and off depression and constant anxiety, needless to say, the affair crippled me.

I always thought it seemed a bit silly getting worked up over online bullying. I mean, just delete your account right? I didnt think of the after effectsects.

It took me a long time to be able to even thing about dating again, but eventually (mainly down to pressure from my friends) i set up a tinder and POF account. I wasnt getting many matches and this got me pretty low. Ive always had self esteem issues and this didnt help at all. Ive been told im ok looking, ive always had very pretty girlfriends and my wife was beautiful, but i struggle to see it in myself and always worried that one day they would see me the way i saw myself, ugly and pathetic. I always kept this to myself, i could never tell them how i felt because i was worried they would then realise i was right.

After not much luck i decided to try a (unnamed) subreddit which rates appearance (i know, i know). To be fair, the people on the subreddit were very kind amd really did make me feel better. They may have been nicer to me because i explained my situation and the divorce. The only problem was, the image had to be uploaded to imgur first with me holding a bit of paper with my username in and asking if i was ugly.

The people of imgur were horriffic, picking out every trait which i hate about myself. I quickly deleted the photos and my imgur account. However they had my username on reddit. 

Many of my posts got spammed calling me names and saying things about my physical appearance, even when i was posting about something irrelevant like a stupid cat picture. 

This has stopped now but the damage it has caused me is beyond words. I cancelled a date with a really pretty girl because i knew i would only dissapoint her when she saw me. Im now on the maximum dose of Mirtazapine. I was recently asked out by a coworker and had to politely refuse, i went to the bathroom and cried my eyes out. 

For these people it was just a laugh. For me its months of therapy and confidence issues. I know it sounds stupid, its just some dick hundreds of miles away on a computer. But when someone picks out your flaws it can really affect you.

I dont really know why i posted this. But i hope it might make people think before they say something. I know ill be ok eventually.

Thanks for reading",04Jun2017,2

3,"I have a blank mind all the time. The only times I don't have a blank mind is when I am thinking of how blank my mind normally is, or when I'm introspecting and trying to solve this problem/figure out what is wrong.

I zone out so fast, and then I just auto pilot. When I stop thinking about how to solve this problem I just am blank. Brain fog permanently. I have a tough time carrying conversations because I just have nothing to say. Nothing is interesting. Hardly anything is fun. I might as well have negative motivation. I have no desires except solving this problem. Sometimes I try to find out what kind of person I am by stopping introspecting and hoping something will come to mind but it's just an empty zone out of nothingness. 

If needed I can talk about some of the stuff I have determined from introspection, but I'll just keep it at this length for now.",04Jun2017,19

7,"First off, I don't know what other subreddit I could put this in (if anyone has any other suggestions, please let me know).

So I've been getting very wildly destructive mood swings and delusions for the past 4 years and for the past 2 years they've greatly interfered with social and school life. As in by year 10 I started losing motivation, got distracted more by thoughts and delusions, had no motivation to do anything but sit on me bed, I even stopped doing things I enjoy it wasn't just school work, my sleeping habits have gone haywire and I'm either not sleeping at night or just too exhausted from crying and fighting my thoughts that I sleep for the whole afternoon and go to bed early and by year 12 I've been dropping subjects, going from a high rank in my good subjects to a fairly low rank (e.g. 3rd in music 1 to 8th. Or bottom 5 in English and completely failing 3 and 2 unit maths, had to drop to general....same with chemistry but I dropped that all together).

Anyways this is sort of about my eligibility for EAS. I saw a psychiatrist last week and got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (my GP thought it was bipolar). Because I'm busy with HSC I don't have time for weekly group therapy and I'll be starting that next year or when HSC is over. Along with that, I'll have to start seeing a psychologist (I think that's also waiting until after HSC) and I have been prescribed a low dose of an antidepressant and lamotrigine to help balance my moods for now (which mum's getting from the pharmacy she works at on Monday) and will be seeing psychiatrist every 6-8 weeks to check how I'm going and change medication/dosage if needed. Because this is a personality disorder, will I still be eligible for EAS? I am starting treatment, I can provide paperwork and any forms, this has interfered with school for more than 6 months, etc.

Sorry for the long read. TL;DR Borderline personality disorder, extremely bad interference with school and life, don't know if personality disorders are covered by EAS.",04Jun2017,1
8,"I don't know how to crosspost properly, but copy pasted from /r/Anxiety.

So basically, I think to cut down on costs, my uni has started an ""online based journaling anxiety management program"" for people with GAD and panic attacks to ""help manage and help with coping mechanisms."" 

The one FUCKING time I reach out for help, being so prideful, and I feel like they're just trying to shove me into a little box. It's an online program with a one on one meet with a counselor ONLINE for about 20 minutes to ""measure your progress"" every 2 weeks.

What the fuck? Not all anxiety sufferers fit the same damn mold. I wanna talk with someone who can help ME personally with my issues and my triggers and my personal problems, specifically possible OCD due to maladaptive perfectionism and lots and lots of panic attacks, ticks like picking at hair, and nail biting.

I'm just so upset. And the on on-campus psychiatrist is allegedly a douchenozzle who will apparently judge girls for premarital sex (so I've heard) who is generally uncaring and cold. 

I honestly didn't want to initially have to resort to meds, seeing as meditating was helping me a bit and I thought weekly therapy might help more, but my uni doesn't even want to try one on one counseling with students anymore if they seem ""fine enough at the moment of the appointment."" The psychologist didn't really seem to listen to my problems and honestly I didn't really feel like he understood my problems correctly.

So now I'm scrambling for some money to see a psychiatrist for the first time ever since my copay with insurance would be 75 dollars per visit. Or maybe just seeing my family doc and researching a lot of meds so I can ask for something to cool my anxiety attacks (looking at non SSRIs like mirtazapine and BuSpar so I don't have to deal with terrible side effects or dependency issues). 

Thank you for hearing my rant, I'm glad I've gotten it off my chest. I just feel like I'm genuinely falling apart right now with constant panic attacks and hyperventilating and feel stuck.",04Jun2017,1

20,"I'm writing this for myself, but hopefully it will help others who may be having similar problems.

I have mental health issues. There, I said it. Admitting you have a problem is the first step to solving it, right? Personally, my problems are anxiety, very intense mood swings and outbursts, frequent self-harm since I was a kid (never serious enough for anyone to notice until recently), and very occasional suicidal thoughts (not actions, and nothing I would ever seriously consider doing). My problems have strained not only friendships but also family relationships and are about to lose me a significant other (whom I would really rather not lose) unless I can do something about my problems.

I would like to see a professional about my problems, but I have no idea where to start. I have spoken to friends, university mental health counselors, and family, and they all default to something along the lines of “find a doctor you connect with.” Problem is, I don’t know how to do that. I’ve been told it’s like dating, and you have to see a lot of people before settling on one you like, but between work and university, I have little time to spare. Every semester turns into a cycle of saying I’ll find a doctor before school starts, then school starts, work picks up, classes get harder, I get bogged down, and eventually I barely have time to sleep, much less care about my health, mental or physical.

The thought of being dependent on medication scares me, and the thought of seeing a doctor I don't know scares me too. I don't open up to people very easily (in person. Hello, internet people. I'll tell you about all my problems if you ask.). I put on quite a mask when I'm in public or with a group of people, but when I'm alone I tend to stare into space and remember how insignificant I am and go down many a rabbit hole of bad thoughts. When I'm with people I'm close to I tend to take off the mask (which, consequently, is losing me my SO, who seems to have fallen for the mask).

Reddit, I’m on my last straw here. Tonight was not a good night for me. Hopefully you can share some of your stories, maybe how you found help, or point me to whatever thread already asked this question, or any resources you might have that could be useful. I appreciate your time. I just need some help.",04Jun2017,10

22,"On Monday my brother had a nervous breakdown and jumped from a first story window, breaking his heel and damaging his back. In the immediate aftermath my parents visited and helped him through the first few days. Since then his girlfriend has looked after him but she has to return to her placement of work tonight so I'm travelling up to Southampton (Uk) from Cornwall to look after him. 

Largely, I'm going to cook, clean and look after him in a physical sense. However, my brother has issues with addiction to prescribed pain killers, so I'm going to need to monitor his doses and administer his drugs too. He has depression, anxiety and suspected PTSD from our Nan passing away a few years ago. (He's a student doctor and nursed her the night she passed away)

I need advice about how I can be there for him and handle him in a way that only benefits him. I'm scared about treading on his toes or saying/doing the wrong thing but I just want to help him see that there is no judgement from me just love and support- if anyone is trained or has experience with these things a comment or an inboxed would mean the world to me.

23,"There is a lot of stigma around balding, IMO none of it good. In addition there is a significant level of importance placed on a full head of hair - peoples perceptions of bald people are often different to those with full heads of hair.

Thus going bald can negatively contribute to mental health issues - it was like that for me at least.

My uncles went bald young and about five years ago (24) I started to notice the signs.

I tried all the ailments and 'cures', but to no avail - they are basically snake oil marketed to vulnerable and desperate people.

When I finally threw in the towel I decided to shave it all off. Clean. To my surprise, this acceptance of the truth of my life actually made me feel better. I was no longer fighting an inevitable outcome, just accepting it.

This lesson of acceptance has helped me to overcome some of the trauma and abuse of my past as well as some of my other deficits.

I have learnt to just accept reality and make realistic changes from there.

Anyway, after that, I had to talk to two nurses and a psych team. All of them had the same reaction, and decided to ask Crisis to visit me. At this point, I was kinda wondering if I wasn't understanding something important, but idk.

When Crisis turned up, they asked me a bunch of stupid questions (they seemed to think I was suicidal for whatever reason; I've not felt like that for about two months). After that, they took me home, which kinda makes me wonder why everyone else was freaking the fuck out.

32,"Hello, I'd like to ask for some advice on my brother who is mentally unwell. He grew up diagnosed with ADD but later on in life we now believe he has Aspergers or a form of Autism. 

He is 29 living with my parents and does not work (the last time he worked was at Sears and that was about 9 years ago and even then only last maybe a year) ever since then he was going to college for engineering and finally graduated 2 years ago. He has done nothing since then aside from saying he is looking for a job, but refuses to apply for anything other than high paying engineering jobs. He sleeps until around 2pm each day and stays awake until about 6am every day. He goes out to bars very often probably 4 times per week (after digging around for change from my parents - so stealing it - before then he would use his college loan money and credit cards for this, both of which are huge debts now and he no longer has any credit).

This isn't even that bad, he's a bum who steals from my parents. Where it gets even worse is that he will randomly have mental breakdowns where after coming back from the bar (or whenever his meds mess him up) at 3am or whenever, he sometimes will blare music or start stomping or hitting things which wakes everyone up then when my dad confronts him, they basically getting into yelling matches which will probably turn physical soon. They have called the police on him before for the verbal abuses, but all they could do was refer to psychiatric care - but what can my parents do since he is a 28 year old adult?

As far as my situation, I just moved out (I'm 27) and am on my own now, unfortunately this seems to have triggered my brother to start bringing over guys (he's gay) to the house and have them in his room doing who knows what and making loud noises. Of course he has them over at 3am in the morning or super odd hours.

Do you all have any advice on what we can do?? I feel so sorry for my parents since they've always helped us out and my bother just has zero respect for them and feels like they owe him (money, car repairs, etc.). I know obviously the mental issues are at play here big time, but can we have him sent to a psychiatry place or something.. he really needs it it seems (the issue is he would never go willingly)? 

If it weren't for the 3am verbal and disrespect abuse to my parents, it would be a different playing ground, this is just so sad and me and my parents don't know what we can do.

38,"So I've had pretty bad anxiety and depression over the past 15 years after various and continuous traumatic events. I'm on the highest dose of anti depressants and have seen numerous therapists one therapist made a pass at me and it put me off for a number of years.

40,"Although I am not certain this post belongs in this community I have decided that this location is the best for its correlation with the topic I am presenting. My question, to anyone peculiar enough to read this and examine it, is to please, explain my similarities between my comparison, what this means, and if anyone has background in diagnosing, then may those of you who can, diagnose me.

To pre-answer questions, no I do not have Aspergers. I have never been to be mentally analyzed and I have never been to a therapist. I am what you consider normal, from the outside at least. I function efficiently and effectively in society, not being an outlier by my decision. However, I have been complemented and discussed with about my high intelligence level. No, I am not boastful despite what I have and will write, but my intelligence hasn't always been an asset for me, in fact it is my one weakness, liability, in social interaction. Yet my social life is perfectly normal. I have no troubles interacting with people day to day, nor do I have troubles publicly speaking (something I actually enjoy), and the ever often analyzation of other people. And herein lies the complication. My title pertains to this article here, making the connection, where I can only make a connection with, that is the mind of Sherlock Holmes. I am quick to say that I do not present this as something to be boastful about, but yet I find myself hesitant to type this as I find it hard to seek advice from others. I by no means have a superiority complex yet at times I find it difficult to be patient with those who are slow or do not see things and analyze them clearly, and understand the picture. This is not to say I have a hatred for those with mental disorders that give them problems, this annoyance comes in everyday social interaction with people. Reverting back to my comparison, I embodied almost all of not a large majority of the characteristics that Sherlock Holmes presents, in the books (which I have read), the show, and movie. The biggest outlier I see in myself is the emotional connection I have with my family. But, don't be mistaken that I have many emotional connections and yet that any of those connections are strong. The exceptions are my close family, yet any relatives I know, I lack that connection with them. However, in recent events the most peculiar thing has happened, in that I made a strong emotional connection to a woman, (you should know I am 17, and this happened during May), as I have friends of the female gender yet find it hard to make an emotional or sexual connection to them. But, what fascinates me is that I have only come to know her retrospectively from social media encounters, until the month before this dance we attended (prom) I had been forced by my parents to attend this event, in which case I so obviously came to the conclusion of asking this girl. Overtime we texted, talked, went to the dance, went to an after party, and in all that time something inside me had grown attached to this connection and pushed my interest forward for more. Yet the following days decided otherwise, as soon she came to explain to me that her situation was that she had not wanted any relationship due to the short amount of time she had left before college. And for the first time in my life, I was heartbroken. Nevertheless my unheartbroken self had already anticipated this course of action, and has known its day of release was inevitable, yet the small emotional part of me that had not matured, had grown and at the same time was destroyed. 

Now, this long story is not for me to vent, but is my description of the only time I've had a true emotional connection to someone outside my close family, and close friends. But my question still remains, I wish for the reader, you, to diagnose me. Of course, I have already done so feverishly and in depth, yet my fascination comes from what others thing, what outsiders observe?

45,"I feel so lonely right now. I have no one to talk to. I’m a 20 year old female, currently in college. The last few years have been a rollercoaster and I've had an incredible rough time trying to deal with everything. I just need to talk to someone. Sorry if this turns out to be a very long post...

It all started 4 years ago when I was 16. I was in high school and had a bright future ahead of me. I was a good student and, although I had a few problems going on, I was mostly happy. Then I was diagnosed with severe scoliosis, which was very rough. I would have to have surgery and it was somewhat scary. At the time I don't think the surgery was the hardest thing to take, I guess it was more the thought that I could no longer be just a regular person, this was something that I would have to deal with for the rest of my life.

The surgery ended up being delayed for almost one and a half years. The first time it was delayed it was because I started throwing up, I couldn't even keep water in. So they said they wouldn't do the surgery, it was too risky. They also said it was most likely caused by stress. In fact, as soon as I left the hospital I started feeling better. After that they scheduled two or three more dates for the surgery, but it always ended up being delayed, for various reasons. That took a big toll on me for some reason. I hated having to deal with that.

During this period I also faced some changes in my classes, which kept me from seeing my friends as often as previously. I think the lack of a solid support network also hurt me. My grades started dropping, I pretty much just played games all day and didn't study at all. Games kept me away from reality, I guess.

So, right after my final exams, I had surgery. I was 17, almost 18. It was the worst pain I ever felt. I’ve broken bones before, but this was a whole new level of pain. And the pain killers did absolutely nothing. I didn’t feel any relief. It was the worst week of my life and I almost regretted having the surgery. In fact, I still struggle with that thought. I went home and I spent the whole summer in pain. Getting out of bed was hard, standing up for long periods of time was hard. But the doctors always said that it was normal.

I didn’t want to apply to college. I didn’t feel strong enough to go, I was in pain and I knew that I wasn’t ready. But my mom started pressuring me, she was freaking out so much about it that I decided to go just because I couldn’t deal with her anymore. So I went. And it was horrible. I was in so much pain… I started taking painkillers daily. My housemates thought that I was exaggerating, that it couldn’t be that bad, but it honestly was. Today it’s more manageable, I still have pain in certain spots, but I guess I’m more used to it. And I know what helps. I also can’t feel most of my back, only pressure. It’s weird and I don’t like when people touch me there.

I had a crappy year. I also ended up hating the area I chose, so I dropped out. Decided I wanted to pursue something else but first I wanted to take a gap year to just try and organize my thoughts and my head. I went to a psychologist and to a doctor during that year to try and maybe get some anti-depressants. Honestly, I don’t think any of that helped. Maybe the psychologist helped a bit, especially with my relationship with my mother. She is very depressed and is a very negative person to be around. I guess the psychologist helped me deal with that.

During the summer before my gap year I started dating with a girl I felt very attracted to. She ended up being an extremely manipulative person, but I still kind of liked her because she listened to me and seemed to be the only person who worried about me. We had a long distance relationship during my gap year. When I went back to college, me and her spent a lot of time together in my house. She started being abusive, started yelling at me for various reasons. She would get mad at me for playing games instead of studying, which I sort of get, but I don’t think yelling was the right way to deal with it. She would threaten to leave me. Then when I would tell her to leave she would grab the kitchen knifes and threaten to kill herself. I knew it was abuse, but I let it happen because I didn’t know how to deal with it. She was also the only person that seemed to worry about me, so I kept the relationship going. 

During the first year in college and the gap year I gained a lot of weight. I’ve always been an emotional eater and overweight, but I really lost control during those years (still don’t have it under control). When I went to college (the second time) I decided to look for a psychiatrist because I felt lost, depressed and had a lot of brain fog that kept me from focusing. I was nervous to go there, I always hate going to the doctor. But I went nonetheless. And it was awful. He was so rude, wouldn’t let me talk, would interrupt me while I tried to explain what I felt. I started shaking and crying a lot. He then interrupted me and just said “Grab that scale over there. Weigh yourself. See what’s the problem?”. He then proceeded to give me a prescription for stuff to help me lose weight and the same pills my previous doctor gave me, which I told him didn’t work. I left his office crying my eyes out and just threw the prescription away.

So I decided I would try my best to just keep my mind busy and try to push through this hard period of time without help from anyone. Which I managed to do for a while. I actually got a couple of very good grades! I felt like I was achieving something. It was nice and rewarding. But something had to go wrong, something had to crush the hard work I was doing regarding my mental health. About a month ago I was walking home from class and started feeling an incredibly strong stomach pain. I couldn’t even walk, so my girlfriend took me to the hospital. After a lot of hours waiting and a few tests they say that something is wrong but that I would have to do more tests to find out exactly what it is. Turns out I have gallbladder stones and have to have surgery to fix it. Now, I know this one is nothing compared to the other one, but it still hit very hard.

I stopped studying, I started skipping classes, I felt crushed yet again. And my study-obsessed girlfriend just wasn’t helping. The problems with her kept getting worse and worse. More recently she hit me a couple of times and started being violent when I wouldn’t do stuff like she wanted. One day she snapped because I was playing games instead of studying (and, apparently, distracting her). She left the house and came back a few minutes later, ran towards me, threatened to hit me and was just being verbally violent. I tried calming her down but she wouldn’t, so I snapped. I was tired of the abuse, I was tired of her and I pushed her. I pushed her 3 times and then slapped her. She started crying and, after a few minutes, just left. I felt relieved but, at the same time, I knew I had lost the only person that cared and that what I did to her was wrong. This was 4 days ago and I still feel bad and crushed about it. I know I shouldn’t have hit her. I thought I was a very calm person, but I wasn’t able to deal with that situation. To be honest I kind of feel like shit right now.

This is just too much for me to handle. The constant back pain, trying (and failing) to study and do well in college, the breakup, the new surgery… It’s just too much, I’m not that strong. I try to be, but just can’t. I tried looking for help but the doctors haven’t been very nice. My friends seem to only care about themselves. I’m lost. I feel like I hit a new rock bottom. I feel worthless and I am beyond scared of being alone forever. I just needed to talk and get stuff off my chest. If you made it this far, thank you so much for listening.",04Jun2017,5
