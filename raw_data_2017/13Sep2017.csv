0,"This is the first time I've reached out online about someone in my life I'm worried about and wish I could help in some way. This is referring to my father, who I believe is experiencing some level of paranoia. This started years and years ago, possibly 10-15 and has graduated in intensity and prevalence since. My dad believes he is a targeted individual and will be hyper aware of his surroundings and make odd comments about the location and people around him. He's made countless phone calls to police (who are rightfully worried) and contacts the local airport in such hostility he could be pinned as harassing them as he's requested the information on everyone who rents a hangar there and has 'fixed' info regarding a particular hangar he believes to be owned by someone who's out to harass and stalk him. Not to mention he's pulled over people and accused them of following him. The most horrifying revelation I've made is his 'evidence drawer' where he stashes all his shreds of proof so he can possibly(?) one day make a court case. The 'evidence' includes the likes of homemade transcripts of public conversations around him (adding notes about how they're about him), detailed notes about everyday items as a reference (in case they're switched out), and reams of email transcripts between him and a particular former employer (whom, from what I can gather, is the reason why he believes he's a T.I. and being harassed by airplanes and stalked). 

He's vehemently against seeking help in regards to paranoia and instead insists he'll only see professionals for ""stress-related"" afflictions. This whole situation has worn on my mother in particular who has told me she's gotten a bit hyper-vigilant herself and worries the paranoia is rubbing off on her. As a student going to college and living on my own it feels like I can't really help in anyway and it hurts to hear my parents being strained by this situation. I have my own psychiatrist whom I've informed of the situation and it really doesn't seem like anyone can help unless my dad consents to it... which feels like a lost cause. Is there anything I can do?",13Sep2017,1

3,"I'm just wondering if others have noticed this in themselves. 

I was on medications for quite a few years to help stabilize my mental health. During that time, doctors frequently commented on how I had 'such clear insight' to my feelings. I figured it was just due to practice with getting words to portray what I want them to (e.g. Creative writing). I just retrospectively realized that I had only ever spent time in counselling/therapy/psychiatrist appointments after starting medication. 

As of 2016, I've been off of them (and doing well, comparatively). However, I began noticing that I've been having a way more difficult time talking about how I'm doing. So, if I feel like something is off and want to track symptoms in a journal, I can't articulate it properly and just give up; if I want to talk to my SO about a significantly bothersome emotion, I may be able to start a sentence but can't bring myself to finish what I'm saying and end up just trying to ignore the feeling altogether; if I need to speak to a medical professional about mental wellbeing, I can't organize my thoughts enough to actually figure out what I even need to say.

To be clear, it's not as though I spend my time 'searching' for problems to be addressed in my psyche. During the times when I feel I need to speak about something, it is completely appropriate to do so. I just can't anymore, haha. Most of the time now, I have no clue what's going on in my mind unless I have some prompting open-ended questions to work from, and even then I can barely figure it out.

Anyway, just curious.",13Sep2017,3
4,"So a week ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/6yj8bn/so_preoccupied_with_getting_put_in_a_psych_ward/) about being constantly preoccupied with the thought of being admitted to a psych ward, and that it was interfering with my ability to put any thought towards my actual treatment plan.

I've since had the appointment mentioned in that post, but still haven't brought it up to anyone. My care coordinator has brought up some good ways to move forward, such as meet with her every 2 weeks, have a support worker come to my house on the weeks I don't see her to take me places (to get me out the house more), do more things as a family, and see whether I'm ready for DBT in 6-8 weeks. Even though I understand that this is actually a great plan and one that is taking in my extreme aversion to both change and talking to people, it still feels to me that I need to be hospitalised *first*.

I would *hate* to be one of those people that go to their doctor with a handful of printed out articles, having already diagnosed themselves, and refusing any other treatment the doctor suggests because *they* know best - but I really can't get this thought out of my head. I have thought about it probably 80% of my waking hours for the last 6 months, and even though I know I would be putting myself through hell, I don't see how any treatment can be effective with my mental state the way it is currently.

This is a very long winded post to ask for advice on how exactly I would go about mentioning it to my Care Coordinator. Do I bring it up next week? Do I email? Do I write out a list of reasons why I think I should go? Do I include my list of cons? Do I bring up the fact that my time is running out and my deadline is only 4 months away? I don't want her to think that I've just read about it online and am going to treat it like a hotel stay that has no consequences or ill affects. I just feel that taking me out of my house and removing my family is the only way for people (including me) to see how bad my mental state *really* is, however I would never do this ""voluntarily"" - in this context something like sending my parents out the room/leaving the house alone/spending extended time with someone without a parent in the same room.

p.s I can elaborate on why I think this if needed - I was getting off point so deleted unnecessary details. Thank you for any help :)",13Sep2017,1
5,"My mom sometimes (but rarely) gets so angry that she almost loses control. In other words she will flip the hell out and scream and go crazy no matter where it is or who is around when she gets very angry. I'm talking about RAGE. As bad as the shit you see in the movies where someone gets so angry they kill someone. Its rare for her to get to that level, but it happens once in a while due to an argument between me and her.

Keep in mind there is absolutely no reason for her to get so angry and even though I argue, I don't go crazy of yell or embarrass myself like that in any way (other than getting angry and yelling). So her reaction is completely unjustified.

She does deal with some physical pain and depression, but I feel like a large part of her anger and pain is from not forgetting things said and arguments in the past. She NEVER lets go, not even stuff from 20 years ago. The past coming up is not just out of nowhere, but in the middle of an argument that has nothing to do with the past.

I've seen her on a few occasions get so out of control that she hit herself VERY hard over and over again. Sometimes its her knee, sometimes she'll punch herself in the head repeatedly. Once again, this is rare, but it has happened several times in the past 10 years.

She isn't physically violent with me and I do not live with her. I'm almost bigger than her and workout, so if I was attacked, I could get out of it and away if necessary, but it hasn't happened.

What treatment options are there? What type of medication would she be given?

Hello Community, 

Recently I have discovered what true rage looks like. Tonight I had a random fit of rage that I cannot seem to link with anything. This rage was no ordinary rage, in fact I never recall having a fit of rage in my life, or at least from what I can remember. 

To make a long story short, what triggered my rage was car maintenance gone wrong. Upon realizing that I had done more damage to my car than I had repaired I started to gradually lose my mind. A blackout came over me and all I can really remember is that a calm breeze turned into powerful winds. Large boulders which weigh around 20-25 pounds were thrown to the ground and split into pieces. Fried Chicken was chewed to the last piece of skin. 

Swearing and yelling can be heard from miles away(mind you I live in a quiet but populated valley in Oregon). I was so angry that I completely destroyed what I was working on, I trashed my maintnence area, and completely wrecked my car. This is not just minor cosmetic damage anymore this is a bumper replacement, a driver's side mirror replacement, and a dent removal or four. 

This rage that overtook me made me realize how much damage we as individuals are capable of. This was a display of Obsolete power, and the evil that rests within all of us. My natural instincts were in full effect I felt like a gorilla that pounds it's chest and takes charge. I felt like the Avatar when triggered into the Avatar State. 

It felt as if I was invincible, it felt as if I was a God myself. With the natural elements mirroring my sheer ferocity I began to forget about my car troubles and began raging even more. Now I feel completely refreshed, I feel like this rage was something that I have been searching for my entire life. It felt good to just let it all out. 

My reason for reaching our to Reddit is to see if any of you have had similair episodes, or rage incidents of your own that you would like to share. I would love to read them! 

Thank You, and good day.

Here's the deal. I am trying to figure out how to get my girlfriend health insurance. The main details are, she is currently on a health plan through her mothers employer, which so far as I know will over cover her in that state (New Mexico)
The issue being, we moved 2 months ago, do to my new job. Also because of family relationship issues, we no longer have ANY contact with her mother/father, and it seems as thought that will not be changing anytime soon.

I need to find out if its even possible to sign her up for medicade, when her information is already on an existing health plan in the state of new Mexico (Pres hospital). She has no income, and needs to be seen for various things,
the most pressing being a therapist. My family suffered a tragic loss, the sudden death of my cousin who is the same age as me, and due to above family issues, and other underlying things she is really struggling to deal with it.
the cost of a therapist being over $100 per session, that really isnt very feasable for us at this point in time. My employer doesnt have a policy allowing her to be covered under our insurance plan. Is there a way for me to sign her up for another health plan?",14Sep2017,1

15," (I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, but I skimmed around and this seemed like the best place. Feel free to redirect me if I made a mistake.) 

This is obviously a throwaway account. Ever since I could remember, I would always think about someone doing something terrible to a loved one and me doing something back to that person. This started when I was a kid, I'd always think about ""What if someone hurt my mom, beat her terribly, what would I do to that person?"" This has progressed throughout my life. It's gotten to a point where I cannot really help it and it just happens. Mostly nowadays its about my girlfriend, *mostly. I love her to death. She's also the only person I think I've gone into depth with this about. I'll just be driving, or doing nothing really, and a thought will rise into my head; ""What would I do if someone hurt her? Raped her? Tried to just rob her but ended up shooting her? What would I do?"" I then go through an elaborate scheme of events. Each thought has it's own story, characters, perpetrators, etc. Each time I act on sheer anger alone and I end up killing the person, beating them until they need a hospital, torturing them in some crazy way, etc. Sometimes these are dreams, sometimes very (Very) vivid daydreams. 

These dreams are very methodical. I turn into a new person. I become someone else, almost like a serial killer.  They get very bloody at times. They're also very realistic, not cartooney or fake in any sense. I find the guy who did whatever to whoever and I put a gun in their mouth. I find the guy who hurt whoever and I kick their teeth in. I mean detailed, graphic, things. All times are graphic, not graphic like a cheap action film but graphic like a Tarantino movie. I don't feel that guilty afterward either. Sometimes they have the power to change my mood or even ruin my day. I recall this time I had a dream someone had done something inexplainable to my girlfriend. I woke up crying. I literally went over to her house just to hug her and hold her, this was before I told her anything too. I've looked this up before and all I could get were just things to help people with murderous thoughts, like killing people for no reason type of thoughts. I don't believe I have anything to do with this category. I go into depth with these like 3 times a week. They last about 10-40 minutes when it's not an actual dream. I don't know how to explain it, but it's completely involuntary. 

Heres a little about me: I love animals to death, I never grew up liking to hurt things for pleasure or anything like that. I'm a huge dog person, this issue also extends to someone hurting my puppy too. Although, I have always liked violence to an extent.  Loved and still love fighting (Not for no reason, but like as a sport). I used to box for years. Guns have been a hobby of mine since I was a kid. not because I like killing things, this hobby of mine probably stemmed from me spending time with my grandpa growing up, he was a Vietnam vet. Me and my dad also went to the range together a lot. That being said I hate hunting, it makes me sick to the point where I've considered becoming a vegetarian before. Aside from the issue I've written about I am not quick to anger. I'm otherwise an extremely forgiving person. I've even forgiven people who've wronged me time and time again, despite others' advice. I always find myself going out of my way for people, and I love doing it. Aside from what I've said I do not fit the description as a potential murderer or something like that.

This isn't something that terribly bothers me, I'm not worried about my mental health, although sometimes I scare myself whether it be with the things I've imagined myself doing or the things I've imagined happening to someone I love. I only have these thoughts about people I seriously love more than myself. People I'd die for. I care deeply about a good number of people but this doesn't apply to many.

Can someone tell me if this has a name? If I should be more worried? If this is common in people where x happened in their childhood? Thanks for reading.

19,"This might be long but please read. I'm on the edge and my mind feels like it's frying.... thinking of suicide very soon. I just want some immediate help while I wait for my therapy appointment to be scheduled.

So, almost two years ago i had an awful encounter with a long-distance girlfriend. We had gotten very close and met up every few months until she suddenly broke it off with me.

I flew down to where she lives in the middle of the night to try and fix things. She ended up nearly strangling me to death in her car. I ran away naked in a parking lot, she got very close to running me over. Cops showed up, I covered for her, and I ended up in a psych ward for 3 days.

A few months later, March 2016, the obsession with what I call ""worldwide symmetry"" began. Im convinced she is the cause of this mental disease that's eating away at my mind.

At the time it felt normal. It was a delusion that still goes on to this day, where I feel obligated to find perfect symmetry/alignment in every aspect of my life.

E.g. perfect alignment in my career, making sure the name of the career has an even number of letters. Perfect alignment in the technology I buy, e.g., cellphones only from 2013, 2003, or 1993. Why these years I don't know.

Another example is in the ""aesthetic"" of my life at any given point. What was my aesthetic in 2000? What about 2004? What about 2008? This doesn't make any sense in writing but it made sense to me last year.

If I didn't find solutions to these problems my mind would go berserk and I'd feel a physical pain in my gut. It got worse and worse and slowly the derealization developed.

I no longer feel like anyone else is here with me. I feel alone. On paper I know it's ridiculous, but my gut tells me I'm the only conscious person on earth.

And on the rare occasions I go outside (been NEET for 4 years), it feels like a dream, like something out of a nightmare. I can't stand this feeling. It got worse as my sleep schedule shifted, and I started waking up at 7pm.

My window is covered up and I have zero sunlight which probably doesn't help.

Sometimes while watching TV or reading interviews online I'll think certain quotes were meant for me, like hidden riddles, and if I solve the riddles, I'll wake up in the ""REAL"" reality where all the conscious people are, and I'll get to meet a man/god named Benjamin who I've imagined to look like Santa Clause with a suit on.

I've had no hallucinations, but these extreme delusions and all the paranoia I feel (I constantly feel like I'm about to die) makes me think of schizophrenia.

I often think about murdering the woman who strangled me, and her new boyfriend. I wouldn't actually do this but I'm afraid of what my mind will be like in 5 years if things don't change..

Does anyone have any advice? What does this sound like to you? Please help me. This is the first time talking about this to ANYONE except my mother. I've been in this chaotic fog since March 2016 and I want to get back to the real world. I'm so scared.",14Sep2017,6
20,"So, this year I graduated from my university (Wohooo) this was in February. The next day of my final exam I was at my father's factory sorting inventory (blah blah)... So, soon afterward my mom's uncle died which ended up with visitors at my home. Now, the day he died my maternal grandmother started yelling the most obnoxious stuff at the top of her lungs. I mean I love her and God bless her but this definitely took a toll on me. Went to the funeral processions and it got worse. Now at point and time, nothing happened. But in the coming days, something did happen and it happened for the worse of it. So this day I had too many sweets, one thing more, since I was a teen my parents always stressed me to take less sugar because of genetic diabetes in our family. So it was in my mind that I had too many. Fast forward to the evening that day I am on my laptop on my bed. My uncle and aunt come home, they seem distressed and definitely notice that. Anyhow, I ignored it. My uncle loves ice cream and he suggested we both go get some. Sitting there he ordered the biggest serving of all despite my evident reservations and I gulped it down because I don't like wasting food (I promise you I changed that day)... here's the brief that I wrote somewhere else...

""OK, so here I go. This one day my aunt and uncle came (They were visiting our city cause my mom's uncle had died). I felt they were stressed out, and I didn't like that one. My diet that day was a bit on the sugary side and I was conscious of it. I had a lavish lunch that I took at 5 pm. Two servings of rice and a bit of fish (I don't eat fish usually). So, I go out with my uncle to get ice cream. Originally I want to have the smaller serving because I am conscious that I've had my share of sugar for the day. But I end up eating their biggest serving, I feel blood rushing, I immediately get up from the chair. I try to calm myself, I can't. It gets worse in the car, we immediately head for the nearest pharmacy. My B.P is 170. I get some medication but instead of keeping it under my tongue I swallow it, so no effect. I immediately tell my uncle to head for the hospital, we're there in about 15 minutes. Well, I guess I had a panic attack after that. But the doctor was kind, he literally gave me nothing except some stomach medicine which I took one dosage of. I am fine now but those were three weeks of irregular heart beat. I couldn't listen to conversations, felt tired. Couldn't drive properly. I was scared and btw I don't eat junk food a lot. I don't know how to order KFC or McDonalds because I don't go there. And I jog 3 times a week at least""

End result: I am mostly fine but once in two weeks I get these really horrible anxiety surges and it's overwhelming. Please advise... anything would be welcome.

21,"I am currently living at my mom's house while transitioning through life. She is a mild hoarder and that has spread to my old room where many areas of my room (closet, on tables, under beds) etc are full of junk. I really need my environment to be organized. Having a mixing of most of my possessions with a bunch of junk is causing unrest in my mind. As my clothes move through the cycle I've lost track of where they all are. 

Furthermore, I have furniture and various possessions in 2 apartments, I don't have the means of collecting everything and putting it in one place. It's really causing a lot of mental frustration because I just have too much to organize. I can't throw away the junk that isn't mine, and I have no room to organize my own stuff. I have stacks of paperwork from college. 

Lastly on my computer I have terabytes worth of data, I simply can't figure out how to sort it all. 

I think all of this relates to myself feeling too nostalgic over the past. For some reason I just can't remember things very well, I've come across a lot of old stuff and it has scared me just how little I remember of my own life. I don't want to forget about the past, so I don't want to throw away stuff I have memories of, and I don't want to move or delete files from years ago. 
But now it's too the point where I can't focus on the present. I feel like I am not really living right now, I'm not enjoying my time and so I'm not making any enjoyable memories at all. Moreover, my life has changed so many times in the past few years, that I feel like even if I enjoy myself it will all too soon become something I've forgotten about.

22,"I'm not sure if this would count, I'm not sure if you have to have actual sensory hallucinations or if thoughts that bore themselves into your head and occasionally become so overwhelming you can't function count as ""voices""... but here are the details as best as I can describe them.

At times, I will get absolutely swamped with negative thoughts about myself. They are generally of the same vein: ""I'm worthless,"" ""I'm a burden to others,"" ""Everything I do just hurts my loved ones,"" ""My continued existence brings tangible harm to everyone I care about,"" etc. These are usually accompanied by a flood of memories, generally every example of every moment in my life that I can remember where I ever felt embarrassment, shame, guilt, failure, and/or times when I did indeed inadvertantly do things that hurt or disappointed the people I care about. It can get so overwhelming that I can't function--I've had to pull over on the side of the road while driving on multiple occasions, or just collapsed on the floor. While these usually happen when a new example of this occurs (or shortly after) it can sometimes just happen when my mind wanders while taking a shower or trying to fall asleep. Usually anything that even slightly reminds me of an embarrassing memory has a risk of leaving me a gibbering wreck--and the longer I live, the more such memories I have, so the more things can do this.

ABout 4 weeks ago my wife had a breakdown and hurt herself by cutting her leg up on her thigh.  She kept saying things like ""I'm not ok, I'm not ok."" She asked for help and I took her to the ER and they admitted her to a voluntary ward.   The first few days were awful.  I would get angry calls yelling at me for locking her up and abandoning her.  I was devastated and was having a rough time functioning because of the guilt, I used all my sick time and then went on unpaid leave for an extra 9 days to take care of my step son who is 4.   I work in automotive and my schedule doesnt allow me to take him to preschool or be there before they close.  My wife had aways done that as she is a teacher.  

fast forward 2 weeks and she is home and trying hard to gert reay for the start of the school year and getting stressed.   I tried to talk her into going to the outpatient day program and she wouldnt hear anything about it.  All she wanted to do was get back in the classroom.   She said it's her safe place and happy place.  She made it two weeks before I came home and found our living room a mess.  Drawings and writings all over and her freaking out just sitting on the floor.   I asked what happened and she said the demons were back an she has to get them out.   She cut herself again and started flailing and yelling   I had to subdue her and just hold on.  After over an hour she was calm enough that I took her back to the hospital.   

Her son(my step son) is staying with friends during the week so I can work and then visit my wife for the 1 hour a day she can visit.

I am trying to hold everything together while she is there but am struggling under the mental and financial weight of this.

They always start with an odd feeling in my stomach, then nausea, and a very hot feeling. After this the other symptoms that often change occur.

My mother is very overbearing, critical of certain aspects about me, and disturbingly over protective at times (not in a positive way; she won't let me leave the house alone or check the mail unless she's watching me walk out to the street)  I'm also highly sex repulsed despite having a very sex positive attitude towards others (I'm happy people can enjoy and have sexually fulfilling relationships it's just not for me).

But anyways, that's just a bit of background. 

I've been attending college for some time now, I have a 2 year degree I earned from a community college and am now working on my bachelors at a university. However, since I've begun university I've been having these strange thoughts. I'll be in the middle of class, nothing wrong, nothing irritating, just a regular class day (maybe even a happy/good day)- when suddenly I'll get a very vivid thought about killing, or being violent toward my professors or other students. These thoughts are often so vivid I'll zone out entirely and ""wake up"" from them after a few moments. I don't have a nature of being violent at all, in fact, I'm a very warm person- I love helping others and want to make others feel comfortable and safe around me. These thoughts have become more and more frequent as of late, they interrupt my daily life, especially my classes... Lately these thoughts have surrounded shooting up the entire school, or performing a public suicide- the part that concerns me a lot is that during these thoughts I'll feel what I can only describe as a 'sexual chill'(?) I imagine it's same kind of arousal you'd get from being sexually attracted to a person, but I'm not sure because I have never been/felt attracted to a person in that way.

Also I'll make a note that recently I've become increasingly paranoid too; typically normal loud noises will make me jump, at night I'll cover my windows with heavy cardboard panels, I've just installed a second lock on my bedroom door and refuse to sleep if the door is unlocked, and I have never in my life been able to sleep in a fully or semi-dark room. I HAVE to sleep with a bedroom lamp on and sometimes even the TV running so that there's background noise.

Am I just weird? Do you think there's something wrong with me? Any advice/help would be appreciated. I haven't told anyone about this and I'm scared to see the campus counselor or  a therapist about it...",14Sep2017,5
31,"New here. I'll try to explain this in the best terms I can put together. I have a legitimate struggle feeling things emotionally. I just feel like I'm living this synthetic existence. All forced and learned behaviors when it comes to social interactions and companionship. It's almost as if I'm outside, watching myself on auto-pilot just go through the motions of living a life. When someone talks about ""being happy"" I struggle relating to that because I have nothing inside to even compare it to. I've done everything in life that I feel as if I was expected to do. I have no problem existing in social situations and interactions. I Was married, Have children, Good job and such. But there is just no connection with anything. The only time I can even fathom what emotion would be like is when I'm angry. I know I'm feeling something then. It's real. And it's raw. Outside of that I'm just repeating learned behaviors of what social and companionship interactions should be like. I have a girlfriend of 4 years. I enjoy being around her. I enjoy the physicality of being with her. But if she walked out tomorrow I wouldn't feel any different. I put people in a social hierarchy. My children be the top tier. I would fight and die for my kids. But I almost feel as if that's some sort of paternal instinct as opposed to emotional connection. Every other interaction just trickles downward from there. I'm not suicidal by any means. I enjoy myself. But I almost feel as if I'm missing out on specific experiences because of this. I tried explaining this all to my girlfriend as best I could and it didn't go over well. 
I'm just not sure what options I have or what I'm supposed to do or if this should even be a concern and I should just keep moving forward the way I've taught myself and only feeling contempt. 

Thanks for listening. ",14Sep2017,4

33,"I have struggled with low self esteem since I was a teenager. I am now in my mid twenties and in a long term relationship. We have our ups and downs, and we love each other and want to remain together. One major cause of our arguments is my insecurity about myself and our relationship. I get derailed by something small and benign he says and it escalates. I start self deprecating accusations and he gets frustrated and defends himself. We fight, eventually make up and agree I need to make changes for myself. I just don't know where to start, I get depressive and don't take action. And so the cycle repeats. 

I need to find ways to cope with my insecurity for my own sake and for that of my relationship. I just don't know where to start. I feel I need help. My boyfriend is emotionally drained and I can't keep doing this to us. I don't want to keep living in my own stew of negativity and insecurity.

Thank you for reading the long rant strangers of the internet.

TL;DR: Insecurity is ruining my relationship and my life. Need to find ways to cope.",14Sep2017,2
34,"Hello. I have had mdd, anxiety, ptsd, and I am no longer high-functioning. Has this happened to anyone else?

Some background: I have taken every type of pill under the sun to help with my mental illnesses. I'm currently taking 5 mg Lexapro and 5 mg generic pill for Ativan. They work fairly well, and is the best combination of pills I've had thus far. It took me years-until my sophomore year of college, to become high-functioning. I didn't think I'd ever have to worry about getting out of bed, oversleeping, and meaningless crying every day ever again. But now I am a senior in college and I'm having trouble functioning like I used to. I will admit that my anxiety is at its highest ever due to me graduating in December and likely needing to relocate for work. That's the only thing out of the ordinary that I can think of, and I'm not sure if that is what's causing me to not function well anymore.

Has anyone else experienced this? Any recommendations, psychiatric or not? I just don't understand.",14Sep2017,2

38,So I've been dealing with intrusive thoughts and such for years and I don't know whether this is a normal thing for others who deal with them. When a particularly bad thought pops up and won't go away it's almost as if I scream in my head to block it out or repeat words (no no no etc). It gets louder as I inhale/exhale and continues till the thought passes. Is this just normal for someone with intrusive thoughts or is it the type of thing I need to tell someone about? I've been dealing with it for a while and I'm kinda used to it. It feels like my brain knows the thoughts shouldn't happen and tries to stop the thought path before it gets dangerous but i dunno what to really think of it anymore. ,14Sep2017,2
39,I have scars on arms because I used to cut myself. I'm going home today and if I wear a shirt it is very visible. But if I keep wearing a long sleeves its too hot. I don't want my family to see it. I making up lies but I don't want them to know. I prefer to hide it than to show it. I don't know what excuse I should say. Its too obvious that I cut myself. ,14Sep2017,2
40,"Hi everyone, first post here.

The other day it was bought to my attention that it was strange how I always eat things in groups i.e. right now I've just eaten pie, chips and baked beans; first I ate all of the beans, then I ate all of the chips (I always bite them in two) then when it came to the pie I cut the lid off, ate it, then the contents, then the shell. I always eat food the same way (so in groups/would eat another pie, chips and baked lbeans in the same way).

I know I've always eaten this way as to just eat anything on the plate randomly seems completely mental/wrong, but it never occurred to me that it was odd until the other day.

I've thought about other examples, and one of many things I also like to do is when washing my hands, I wash the water over them for five seconds, then soap them for five seconds, then wash off soap for five, then towel dry them for five seconds; however if it's the weekend I do it for ten of each (wild!).

If I don't do things in the ways I like it's a little annoying but I get over it. 

Would you say this was some kind of OCD or Aspergers or am I just a little bit odd?? 

Thanks in advance!!

41,"im just a 16 year old girl (soon 17) and im already a piece of shit. im ugly, my grades arent good, im mean, i dont have friends irl and im fat. when i see people who are the opposite of me, i get so jealous. you cant even fully describe this feeling. its burning inside your chest, a mix of sadness, pain and anger. and a person like this is my internet friend, though, i love her very much. ive met her for the first time a month ago. when i was on my way to meet her, i felt quite attractive for the first time in ages. and when i saw her, she was so beautiful, way way more beautiful. no acne, long, beautfiul hair. and a face of a goddess. i tried not to be so negative, but other than her looks she seems to be rich, wise, and other shit. she has A's. and while i only have D's. while im as poor as a church mouse. while im mean and she is so nice. while boys actually like her, and even everyone else (shes gay tho).i know, even the most 'perfect' people have problems, but thats not it. i cant even tell you how much i fucked up my reputation. i hate myself because of every thing i did. after my 13 suicide attempts, i still feel the same. just thinking about all of this makes me want to kill myself. 
dont tell me to seek a professional help (i did), to stop comparing myself to others or do some yoga. nothing of this helps. im just venting here, i dont want people to take pity on me. i tried venting to my internet friends in the past, but it just gets annoying after time, you know. i mean, they said im just a depressed piece of shit that will never be satisfied with anything. or something like 'you're always sad'. it just makes me wanna puke. that its actually true thats something wrong with me.",14Sep2017,2

44,"Every time I make a post I always try to keep it short, but it usually ends up long. So this will be as long as it will be when I'm done typing it.

I'm 18, a guy, my mom is 54 at the moment, and I can comfortably say that my family and I are pretty close, closer than the average people. It's not that we're like special or anything, but I feel like there are enough calm/collected people to not get riled up by small stuff so we just kinda calm down if anything were to happen.

ANYWAYS... god damn I suck at this...

My mom has always been a bit slow, I don't know if it's because of just being bored or just not really thinking when she should, but I feel like it may be getting a bit worse and worse.

It's extremely difficult to explain because there are so many different scenarios but I can tell you that I rarely, if ever, get irritated, or angry (I might get a lil irritated sometimes).

A big part of this is that I feel like she forgets a lot, and then doesn't admit it a lot of the time kinda thing. 

This already has a lot of parts to it but she is a pity-seeker (Just made a word) and I constantly try to steer her where she can lead a confident and powerful life like everyone should have the chance to. But she just refuses.

She'll always complain about having stuff to do, but then do nothing the entire day. She'll complain constantly about eating too much, when she like barely eats shit during meals. 

I almost can't be alone with her in the house and do my own thing, practically ever. Either she's trying to make me sit in the kitchen to watch tv with her or go shopping with her or something, even if I did that the entire morning of that same day...

And I hate being mean so I'll try to fight it a bit, but then she'll always turn it on me as if I was the one constantly refusing, but I wouldn't if she wouldn't ask literally every single time she stepped out the house. Sorry this is pretty much a rant now at this point.

I try to just tell her that there is really only one way to think about it. It's just fuckin calories and muscle, you need it to survive longer and I don't want to see my mother leave earlier than she has to.

I don't really know what to do at this point.

Please and thank you for those you got through this damn post.",14Sep2017,5
45,"Hey everyone! Hope all is well. USA here. 

I am a college senior and I live in an apartment with two roommates. One roommate is a good friend of mine and the other, let's call him Will, was randomly assigned. 

Will is a very quiet person and when spoken to, he responds very socially awkwardly. We never see him in the commons areas and assume he keeps all of his food in his room. I will speak to him in the commons area and say ""Hey goodmorning man! Have a great day!"" and try to be friendly but he almost never responds. 

I would hate to know that he gets super severe anxiety when someone speaks to him and I'd like to make our living arrangements as comfortable for both of us as possible. Can someone give me some advice as to what should be my gameplan for the duration of our leases? ",14Sep2017,1
46,"If I'm going to be honest I have to say that I already have issues with depression and anxiety. Lately, I've been searching for a job and trying to make money other ways. I feel like a massive burden to my SO and everyone around me.

However, I feel like the thought 'I should kill myself ' passes through my mind more than I'd like it to. I got fired six months ago and tried to be a freelance writer and I've had some success but I've decided to transition back into a traditional job. 

I've had horrible luck, and every rejection feels so intensely personal. I'm really struggling with whether or not to call the suicide hotline and I don't feel like I have anyone older (I'm 21)  in my life that I can be completely honest with and get hell because I was raised by a conservative family that would advise me to ""pray on it."" 

Too broke to afford therapy of any kind, and making it through every day where I have to do tasks is incredibly hard. My Birthday is in two weeks and I'm trying to keep my mind off the fact this will be one of the saddest birthdays I've ever had.
