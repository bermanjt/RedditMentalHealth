but im gonna try
at first i could see situations in my head which were never gonna happen but then people started to point out i was talking to myself which means i must off been wording the situation anyways ive always thought out loud. i have a undiagnosed mental illness having a borderline form of autism doesnt help either 
this sometimes makes my depression and other things worse ive been suffering with depression and some other things since the age of around 15 and im now 23
i hear my voice inside my own head its not coming from outside my head and its faint but i can hear my own thoughts. and sometimes i will have conversations with my inner self which probably doesnt help, i also have what i assume is intrusive thoughts which sometimes can get very very violent.
im also a geek and its gotten to a point without movies, games , tv and music i would fully break down for me i use these as a way to silence my head but sometimes it makes it worse aswell.
i would talk about this with my family but last time i talked about this with for example my mom (who has anxiety) through my depression and anxiety back at me. she also keeps purposely finding ways to set her own anxiety of which then makes my thoughts get louder and louder she can go from trying to say something to help me to saying something extremely hurtful without realising it generally speaking people i know dont truly care about my mental health i always feel like someones trying to have there hand up my ass to control me like a puppet but im not.
i find music and other things is the only things which still keep me alive on the inside some moments i dont feel anything and some moments i can feel too much or the wrong thing for example in the past and this still happens from time to time when i get to upset i start to cry but then burst out into manic laughter aswell at the same time.
i heard i might have something called schizoaffective disorder
but i at the same time i want to go see a therapist about it but at the same time i dont. and to be honest i like to embrace my inner self as well its me afterall, and not just that people constantly throw crap at me so might aswell build it up and throw something there way. then theres my motivation which for me is the biggest challenge im trying to get into making game / movie reviews and gameplay videos on youtube but everytime i go to i come across one issue with recording or editing or uploading then i just start to play some games or watch some movies and nothing ever gets done. so all i do rly is buy games and blu rays play games or watch movies or spend time on youtube watching videos then go to work and repeat. the weirder thing is when i wear a mask i feel calm take it off and i feel like i always do then as the last thing i want to move into a city get a better job get a fresh start but everyone holds me back by either twisting a knife in my back or trying to guilt trip me into not doing it i mean for god sake my god dam dreams are bittersweet now i dream of been able to bend reality and have all superpowers know and i wake up and realise im stuck in the same crap the only thing which has improved recently is that i started chatting to a girl i really really like gone out with her once and we really like to be together so thats the only truely good thing in my life at the moment just so you know my role models are Joker / The Riddler and a few other characters .
sometimes i even liar about how my life is so people wont talk about it then even talk about my girlfriend and i lie about that sometimes as some of the girls at my workplace have boyfriends and keep teasing me and to be honest i hate when people do that 
when im at work i rather be home and when im at home i rather be at work
the only time i get time too my self truly is when i go to my local city to the cinema . but everything i do and say and want to do in the future people i know try to make it about them selves and that probably is the thing whats making me crazy the most
as i stated earlier im undiagnosed but from this can any actually tell me which mental illness i do have and no im not suicidal at all.
my favourite line which resonates with me the most is from the adam sandler movie anger mangement ""theres 2 types of angry people the explosive and implosive"" im the implosive person but at the same time i want to implode but at the same time i dont want to anyways im gonna draw this to a close for now.
thanks for any help given

5,"For about 6 months now i have episodes of both de-realization and de-personalization where its either just a constant water mark telling me nothing is real, or that i have a full blown panic attack.  

Im more than sure i know the cause of the disoder as it started almost instantly when my brother fell off a 3 story balcony and had to go to the ICU, then ever since its a constant thought in my head. It has cooled off slightly but its still there. I would like to see a doctor without my parents knowing as they arent supportive in any shape or form and would be angry at me rather than worried.",25Feb2017,2
6,"So I have a friend who's pretty out there. He is a self proclaimed shaman on a mystical journey of universal discovery. Part of this journey involves taking drugs to experience different realities. He recently took a cocktail of psychedelics. I'm not sure exactly what he took or how much, but he ended up on a 4 day trip. It culminated in him wondering into someone else's house because he thought it was his, where he made himself at home until the actual owner showed up and called the police. He is currently being charged with felony breaking and entering.

During this trip he was hearing voices which guided him around, telling him to search certain areas where he says he found (dug up) multiple fossils and gem stones (these were all left in the house he ended up in so I have no idea if they were just rocks or not). This is not his first time hearing voices, although I don't know his state of mind in those instances or weather or not he was on drugs at those times. He also said that at times during this trip he believed he was the reincarnation of Chris Cringle and other times where he believed he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ. This is the second time he told me he believed he was the reincarnation of Christ, there was about a year or two between these instances where he no longer believed this.

He is also making connections to things where they don't exist (in my opinion). It's hard for me to explain this or provide an example because it made such little sense to me, but a lot of it is related to the English language and finding words that either contain other words or sound similar to other words to form connections to a third word. Like the similarity of Chris (from Chris Cringle) and Christ.

He's about 31 years old, is this too old for schizophrenia to begin to present itself? Does he need medical help or just rehab? If he does need medical evaluation where would he go and how should I convince him to go?

I'm not sure this is the right place to ask this, but I really don't know where to go for advice. To me he seems like he is losing his mind, but to him he is becoming enlightened and moving towards transcendence. Any advice is greatly appreciated, feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer.

I know he's a redditor, so if you're reading this buddy please know it's coming from a place of love not judgment.",25Feb2017,1

8,"I finally took the plunge and saw a psychiatrist last week where she prescribed me an antidepressant (Wellbutrin) and also said I should do therapy. She offers this as well. Would it be best to see her since she also does the medication or is it better to see someone else to get a sort of second opinion on everything? Potentially important detail: the psychiatrist is a medical school resident and I'm not sure how long she'll be around. I'm also not great at opening up to people and don't want to potentially start over again if she graduates and moves. Then again, anyone can move at any time or stop seeing me for any reason. 

TLDR: Would it be better to see my psychiatrist since she also does the medication or is it best to see someone else to get a sort of second opinion on everything?",25Feb2017,1

Is it just caused by my illnesses? I feel like a stereotype, a Canadian who apologizes for every little thing. ",25Feb2017,2

11,"I am a 25 year old who was diagnosed schizo affective in 2012. I had an episode of psychosis, which was terrifying, that landed me in the hospital and another one a year later.The first time I was only on meds for 3-4 months before I decided I was 'better'-and was for a time- but smoking weed every day and dabbling heavily in psychedelics. This threw me into my second episode which was more of a manic ""high"" one and much less scary. I crashed of course and landed in the hospital for my second and last time. 

I have now been on paleperidone (invega sustenna) for 3 full years and went from 150 to 100 to 75 to 50mg every 4 weeks as an injection. I am a huge advocate for this drug because I felt very little mental side effects and only a few physical ones (weight gain, loss of menstrual cycle, lactation). In any case I feel like I am doing very well mentally and am fully functioning...I am very social, I work hard and take care of myself. 

So my question!

I'm wondering if anyone has successfully gotten off of antipsychotics and lived more fully! I feel like I am not reaching my full potential because of the blocked receptors in my brain, I feel lacking. I am also quite a naturalist so I have my aversions to medications. Has anyone out there with schizo affective disorder lived happily without delusion off of medications?

But, if I am sad, angry, or hopeless, when I think about death in a very graphic way, I get relaxed. Almost happy like. Although I am not a suicider, I enjoy thinking about my death in a weird imaginative way. 
Well, my question is: Is it normal? Does someone who is not depressed do it?

19,"So I have never been much of a morning person, but recently waking up has become impossible instead of it just being hell.

I think what made it worse is the combination of being put on medication, my depression, demotivation, weaker physical health, and so on.

However, these are not things I can simply solve just like that. I mean, I am working on it very hard, but the progress is slow. In the meantime, unable to get up causes me to either lay in bed all day and do nothing or even worse, miss appointments that can be very important. But even that does not help me to get out of bed.

I tried the basic stuff; setting different alarms at different locations in my house, installing an alarm app that e.g. requires me to get out of bed and take a picture of something, getting at least 8 hours of sleep, reading before bed or drinking tea to calm me down, asking someone to call me to wake me up, setting an incredibly loud and annoying alarm, turning on the heating so getting out of bed does not give me that physical chill when it froze at night, writing some motivational notes which show when my alarms go off, and so on.

I just do not know what to do. Every time my alarm goes, I feel as if I am just dying. I would give anything, literally anything and all the money in the world, to be able to snooze just a bit longer and end up disabling all my alarms and everything, no matter how hard it is or how much effort it takes, just in order to sleep a bit more.

21,"Hey guys, I have a history of mental health issues. The last diagnosis I got was manic depression, which I didn't take seriously because they just threw an adjective in front of what I already knew. After looking into it everything started to make sense. Anyways, overall I guess you could say I've been on the upswing, things are pretty good. The only problem is I've been having occasional hiccups. In the past month I've had a terrible anxiety attack over something that shouldn't be an issue, and one episode of auditory hallucinations. I still have days where the sky is falling, but they're pretty uncommon. What do you guys think, should I head back to the doctor? I've been unmedicated for around 8 months. Medication has helped me a lot in the past, I'm just not sure if I need that right now.

22,"My boyfriend very recently had a psychotic break due to refusing to take his medication. I did all I could, and it (obviously) wasn't enough. So, to take my mind off of how worried I am, while I wait for him to get home from the psych ward I'm looking for options to help him get better. 

He absolutely loathes all the sedating antipsychotics he's tried. He didn't dislike Abilify, but he said it distanced himself from his emotions too much for his liking. I feel like if we have to go the antipsychotic route again, an activating antipsychotic would be the way to go. However...

Once the non-compliance IM injections are through, I fully expect him to balk at taking anything that's labelled an antipsychotic. Are there, perhaps, some alternatives here? I'm not familiar at all with alternative therapies for psychosis in particular; I know therapy (CBT and REBT in particular) is good for OCD, but I'm not familiar with any treatments for psychosis that aren't antipsychotics.

Any suggestions, advice, links to useful sites/blogs are welcome. I want to gather as much information as I can so I can sift through it over the coming weeks and months while he stabilizes and gets better.",26Feb2017,2
23,"He is a rather brilliant guy, in college he was Magna Cum Laude with solid 100% score in Mexico (scale 1-10). I should say he had a rather difficult time, he was disowned by his family and his father was never very present in his life. 

Nevertheless, he got a full scholarship to do a PhD in a very good University here in the US, and came to the US

Halfway through, he became disenchanted with the research area and found a work at some companies.

Fast forward to this year, and he was working in a rather important financial company in Illinois. I say this, because at the same time I'm mostly following him in Facebook, after Mexico, we never lived in the same city again. And he told me he had great plans to retire at 40 (he is around 30) and be a venture capitalist.

He was a strong Trump supporter, since he wanted him to get rid of the ""lazy Mexicans"" that make it harder for him to get a Green Card. I just mention this because is important in the context.

One month ago, he started posting pictures of him going around town dressed up as some sort of supervillain (white coat, latex gloved and big dark protection glasses). I asked him and he told me he was getting into theatre and improv, and it was an assignment some book recommended him (he did everything self-taught).

Then, he posted a video of him screaming to a guy in his office:""stop keeping me here and let me go"", and repeating over and over that he was being held against his will. The guy seemed pretty calm and kept repeating him that the people in his floor just wanted to help him. 

Suddenly we lost contact, and apparently the company had sent him to a mental hospital. By the way, he had apparently being sleeping 1-3 hours daily for about a week. And had sent an email company wide, to endorse him as an sleepless-elite, and that they had to hurry since people started dying at about 10 days with no sleep. I just knew this after he was at the hospital.

He was discharged one week after, and he told me he had been fired, and that he never sent the email, just a draft that he sent me. Also told me that they admitted him because he was trying to be funny treating his office mates as his minions (in this supervillain persona) but everything was an error, since it was part of his acting gig. They fired him, but he didn't care because they had been morons for sending him to the hospital.

At this point I have to mention that there is no evidence whatsoever of the company pressuring him to sleep only 1-3 hrs a day, and that he was trying to get a ton of stuff done. 

Next thing we do, a friend and I offer him help to get back to Mexico, since his visa was revoked (him being fired). And he tells us that no, that he is going to become a homeless man. We even offered him a rather good paying job in Mexico while he found a new gig in the US.

Then he told me he was going to try and make people feel pity of him as a homeless by saying some weird story, when I told him to go back to the hospital, he told me that no, that he was fine and it was all part of his acting training.

Go to last night, he kept posting things of him dresses in the supervillain suit, recruiting ""minions"", which were convenience store clerks who he said were teaching him ""african languages"" in 20 minutes. He claims to have a photographic memory. 

He then post a picture of himself checking in a Trump Hotel (told you it was important) and then a picture of a letter he wrote at the pad in the hotel that asks Trump to let him work in that room for an indefinite amount of time to help him ""Make America Great Again"", and that he wanted to be his ""Seneca"" (adviser to a Roman emperor).

Next thing I know, a friend sends me an article of a man making bomb threats in a Trump hotel, and the police has taken him and described him as ""mentally challenged"", I didn't want to believe it at first (I mean there are many Trump hotels, and I wasn't sure where he was). But then we were informed it is him.

He is in the hospital right now, and only his family will be allowed to see him, the same family that disowned him, and he has no contact with. Also he has zero friends where he is, the girl we that offered to help him last time, doesn't really want to do it again, which is understandable, she doesn't really know him that well, and she doesn't want to get in trouble.

At this point my wife asks me to keep my distance from him, we have two small kids and she doesn't want him near them. Other common friend (also in the US) unfriended him in FB and is deleting every message he ever got from him. Do you guys have any advice.

24,"Okay so I've felt like this for years but I don't know what to do, I'm scared if I go to the doctors I'll be sectioned, i work in a mental hospital as a health care assistant so I know what it is like to be sectioned. Okay so my symptoms:
I self harm when I feel not loved or not good enough or if I have a bad argument with my family or boyfriend.
I talk to myself out lound ever since I can remember I still feel asif someone or something is listening to me like there in a room with me.
I go through stages where I turn like phycotic for example (few days back my boyfriend said why can't you just be normal so I went upstairs in my house and couldn't stop crying I went to my knees and started head slapping myself and kept repeating ""be normal be normal be normal"". i then went downstairs and did normal people conversations and well anyway it's all sorted now but I turn weird; like a difrent person then ,after the episodie I guess you can call it I'm like ""oh my god that was so embarrassing"".
I need to feel like I'm good at something and loved all the time or I get like depressed and want to self harm.
This is embarrassing but I have this teddy this huge teddy I got him when I was in my early teens, I used to talk to him and pretend he was my boyfriend and I would have phone calls with him after school like pretend to be on the phone to him.
I used to rush home after school to see him and tell him about my day and I would awnser back in a different voice as if I was in a conversation with him, I was bullied in high school so I was lonely. I sometimes still talk to him and cuddle him and kiss him and pretend he is my current boyfriend I do this when I feel asif my current boyfriend isent treating me right or giving me love. 
I'm have very low self esteem sometimes I go Into the shop where my boyfriend works and he's talking to pretty girls and I can't even show my face cause I'm so embarrassed so I would hide around a corner until he is away from that girl. I also worry about everything and have a fear of choking and being sick. Suffer from panic attacks too.

I have suicidal thoughts sometimes, but I'm nowhere near strong enough to actually kill myself. 
So I slap myself sometimes. It hurts, but the harder I slap, the better I feel... mentally. It's sort of relieving to slap myself. Sometimes I hit myself in the head. Other times I dig my fingernails into my leg to make little prints. I don't cut or burn myself... that would hurt too much. These methods are less painful but give me the relief I need.

But I recently discovered writing on myself. I was really angry and upset and frustrated and full of hate earlier, so I took a Sharpie and wrote on the uppermost part of my leg, just below the hip. I wrote ""KMS"" and ""FUCK OFF"" and ""I HATE YOU"" and ""X.X""... and it feels good.

I'm a mixture of highly anxious and depressed. I just want to withdraw from everything. I screwed up life and I won't be able to achieve the things I want. I feel heavily screwed. I hate college and it makes everything worse for me, I'm such an idiot for not being able tune in with my emotions and yet i'm suffering because of this.

I heard from my friend that this dude left his sixth form and is now moving to the sixth form college I go to. And so basically there is a free space left and my mate suggested that I should move back. The problem is that I left that college to go to my current one because I felt really dumb there as there a lot of clever students. In which I felt the opposite as well as being secluded and having no one which caused me to impulsively change. But the fact that there is a little glimmer of hope that I can move back to this sixth form makes me really anxious and depressed as my mate said that he will explain everything about my situation to the sixth form (Depression and anxiety which caused me to leave the school like this because I felt like no one could really relate to me) to see that they can take me back given that it's within my local area too as the other college which I absolutely dread is in another town and that as well as mentally affecting also affects me physically.
As well as this, Biology is the subject that really causes me to be depressed as I don't find any interest in it anymore and use as my career wise it's something different. I wanted to study medicine but im wanting to study maths now as medicine is unbelievably competitive and it's something I know I wouldn't enjoy. I hate my biology teacher and just don't find anything enjoying anymore since I step foot back into this college. Ever since I did, I felt even more stupid compared to these other students, it's like this college will somehow end up sabotaging me in terms of my future aspirations and will never be able to look in to my potential.

I'm currently getting support from my counselor by getting CBT and learning the practices of mindfulness. I'm also getting Fluoxetene to also help my self and make sure that the support I'm getting will be effective as my initial low mood causes me not to even get out of my house whenever I have free days.
Of course, this isn't my main root of depression but one of many as I've more or less experienced this for years but hadn't had help but yet slowly came to become used to it where I don't even bother releasing out my emotions anymore, just can't be bothered.

Life outside i really don't do much, I use to do alot of things that I enjoy but I don't get any satisfaction from it anymore. I usually would study alot and go gym but even studying now seems soo much hard work for something that I can't really be bothered about. I just hate going there I just hope that this other sixth form is willing to take me back in as my college allowed this person to enrol in this time of the year in which he came from the sixth form my friend went. I just hope that they will do the same for me if they can see into my situation and realize how much it's deteriorating me as a person.

It's like everything I've lived up for is to suffer. God wants me to suffer, because I questioned his existence. Hell, if it gets to the point where there is no way out then I guess i should really look into my last resort. Life is very harsh.",26Feb2017,1

51,I have a buddy that is recently separated from his wife of about 8 years. They have an 8 year old and a 6 year old. I was just informed that she was diagnosed bipolar and has never been medicated for it. He believes that this could be a big factor in their recent separation and her wanting a divorce. Is there anything he can do to help get her medicated?  She has been to a psychiatrist in the past. Any help is greatly appreciated. If I'm in the wrong sub let me know. ,26Feb2017,1
52,"Hi,

This has happened to me a few times in  the past week. Twice while lying in bed awake, and the first time whilst I was actually dreaming.

I'll hear a sort of static which increases in pitch and discombobulates my thinking, and as it leaves my range of hearing it's like it jolts my entire brain. This happens several times in a row every time.

The thing is, I haven't been on ssri's in a long time and I've never had this happen before. I have an as needed script for (0.5mg) ativan which I'll take maybe a few times a week, with this past week being the most I've ever taken with one tab Wednesday, two Thursday, and one Friday (the bottle says take 1 to 2 so it's still as ordered). But the first time I got these zappy things was last weekend. It doesn't really make sense that I'd get actual brain zaps taking such small doses of ativan.

Are these brain zaps? Are they seizures? What's going on here? If anyone who's had brain zaps could tell me whether or not these sounds like them, that's really what I need.",26Feb2017,13
