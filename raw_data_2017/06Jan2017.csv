5,"I've always been curious but didn't want to pay for a psychologist because as abrasive as this sounds I'm not trying to fix it. 

I like being alone, not introvert. I haven't ""hung out"" with someone for fun in like a decade. I don't text anyone, I'll go weeks without talking to my parents and honestly if I never spoke to them again I don't know that I'd be that effected. I'm not a pariah, in fact people often want to hang out but I just have no desire. At all. I'm 28 and my wife says I should go hang out with people but it just feels like work. I'm not sad or angry or anxious, just don't want to be around people. 

If we met you'd likely never know, I'll pretend to be super nice and laugh and joke. But really, I'd rather just be at home watching hulu.

I wasn't abused or anything. My childhood was pretty normal but even then I never really fit in with anyone and preferred to be alone. Once I started faking personalities a teacher told me they were concerned about my social behavior a couple years prior. Didn't really change though, I just learned to be fake to get what I want. And FWIW, I've been diagnosed with ADHD.",06Jan2017,2

8,"I'm seeking advice on behalf of my spouse, who has been suffering for quite some time. It -seems- like anxiety but we're no experts. I'll try and describe things as best I can.

He feels panicked and anxious almost all the time. The level of anxiety fluctuates based on stress, and is significantly increased by the pressures of work and family. His work environment is a major source of stress and extremely hostile. We've done what we can but he can't quite and internal resources are ineffective.

One year ago, the stress started to manifest in the form of acid reflux, leading his GP to prescribe a series of ever more potent medications to control it. That symptom has since vanished and evolved into constant nausea to the point of dry heaves. He also experiences physical tremors and incidental depression for which his GP has given him Cipralex.

With the recent upswing in his anxiety, she's prescribed him Abilify.

He's looking for advice. Should he keep taking these drugs from his GP? Should he seek a particular kind of therapy? He's a little lost in how to find help for his anxiety. Relaxation doesn't seem to cut it. We've tried several hobbies, exercise, you name it to try and reduce his stress level. His employee assistance program hasn't provided meaningful assistance. Ultimately, he's trying to find a way to deal with or lessen the level of constant anxiety he feels. We're out of ideas and he desperately needs some kind of help. Any advice would be appreciated.",07Jan2017,1

i've been seeing a therapist for the past 3 months but. i feel it's just like, advice kind of stuff. i don't feel it's helpful to me &amp; like the sessions are fine but i still feel they're kind of annoying bc i'm not asking for advice. what i initially wanted when i wanted to start seeing a therapist was to be diagnosed but also like. there different kinds of therapists, so it confuses me? like what would be the difference between a therapist &amp; a psychotherapist?? what kind of therapist does the diagnosing?

but mmmanyways, i'm a 19year old female, &amp; for about a year or two or so, i've seen myself to be, pretty damn eccentric. idk if this is because this is my personality, or a disorder (actually. what would differentiate ""it's your personality"" from ""its your disorder""?). it doesn't make my life harder &amp; honestly i enjoy being like odd, because i'm not like obviously odd, just subtly odd; odd in My Own Little Ways, but i honestly want to know whats up with myself; is it just Me, or something making me?",07Jan2017,1

13,"I've finally accepted after years of silent suffering that I'm not getting any better on my own. At times I've thought I was ""better"" but something happens and I fall all the way back down again. I suspect that I have avoidant personality disorder as it describes me to a tee. If I'm completely honest, there's really 1 friend and my parents that I'm relatively close to. It hit me like a truck when my phone broke on New Year's Eve, took four days to get a new one, and I didn't get a single text or call in that time. I should be excited about graduating in the spring, grad school interviews, I've done well at school, etc. So basically, I'm severely depressed right now and desperately want to have some serious meaningful contact but feel unable/don't know how to open up and bond with anyone. It's also the first time I've ever had serious suicidal thoughts and it's terrifying.

I guess at this point I just want some help but I don't know what to look for. I had a few questions I was hoping some fellow redditors could help me out with:

* I don't know anything about therapy so I'm not sure what kind of treatments I should be considering based on the above, any advice would be appreciated.
* I really want to give this a serious shot and find someone I can open up to. I know it needs to be a woman as there is no way it's going to work if my therapist is a guy, but how do I find someone with specific experience with people that can't open up to anyone?
* Again I had some suicidal thoughts, would never act on it, but if I tell a therapist that will I be forced to go to a hospital?
* Finally, I want to disclose everything which includes some drug use. I see this leading to two potential problems. First, I don't want therapy to be all about my drug use. On the rare occasion that I do do something it's more to self medicate the social anxiety (never alone). Second, I have health insurance through my university and was wondering if an off site therapist would be obliged to share that information. I don't want anything disclosed to the school that might hurt my career in the future so I was wondering how that works.

Thanks in advance for any advice.",07Jan2017,1

22,"Hey y'all, new to the subreddit.
I'm currently going into my second semester of my Sophomore year at college and things haven't been going the best. My very first semester I failed college algebra because I 
1) Was never good at math
2) Deal with extreme testing anxiety where I would completely blank out then start to panic because I blanked out and in turn start to become physically agitated. 

I ended up taking another lower level math course this previous semester that would suffice and BARELY failed that course as well because of the same issues. My G.P.A is sitting at a very low 2.3 and I actually had dreams about going to law school.

Friends around me are accomplishing great things and are in way better academic states than I am in. A friend of mine, a freshman, just got an internship at the House of Reps. I applied to this same internship and was denied. 

Some days I just kinda sit in my apartment and play World of Warcraft and wouldn't get up or check my phone because I didn't want to interact with people. Whenever I see my parents or old teachers from HS everyone always raves about how ""intelligent"" I apparently am and how they're looking forward to me accomplishing great things.

I'm never going to. I've given my all to my studies and always ending up coming up short? What am I doing wrong? 

I went to the doctor a while back because I was having physical spasm attacks at night when I would think about all of this stuff and he prescribed my Zoloft. I never went to pickup the prescription because I was afraid of (and I know this is such a miniscule and nonexistent thing) the CVS Pharmacy tech seeing that I had to take anti-depressants or if someone found out I had to start taking them. I had a followup scheduled with the doctor 4 weeks after I was supposed to be taking them but never went because I never started and was too scared to say so.

I know this post is all over the place and I apologize I just have a lot I wish I could get off my chest but I don't want to make this obnoxiously long in fear someone will dislike it and in-turn me.",07Jan2017,3

25,"So, this is going to be a long winded post.

I've been with my SO for over 4 years now, we've had the typical ups and downs (finances, work related stuff, etc) but within the last year we've had two miscarriages and in early November her father passed away. I had noticed she had started drifting away from me during the miscarriages and talking with her friends that she met online, which I had talked to and all seemed really cool and supportive of her. I was glad she was getting support. I tried multiple times to get her to open up to me about what/how she was feeling and it would always end up in an argument and she'd push me away further. During this time I learned that one of the friends that she was talking to, was developing more than a friendship with her. I told her that it hurt me and that I wasn't okay with that kind of stuff going on. She tried spinning it as I was controlling who she was friends with, to which I'd point out that he was wanting more than a friendship. She would just tell me what I wanted to hear.

Up to about May of last year, her father had been staying with us for almost two years. He was homeless and we took him in under the guise that he would be saving money and getting his own place. Well, he just drank his money away. Eventually I didn't want my son subjected to it and her and I decided that he needed to find another place to live. We gave him a month to find something and he left unannounced after three days. 

When her father passed away she just shut down. She was drinking a fifth of Fireball a night with no signs of slowing down. It was about two weeks before Thanksgiving she told me that she didn't love me anymore and that she wanted to end our relationship. I then found out that she had been continuing talking to that guy online this whole time. I tried for those two and a half weeks to get her to stay, to work things out. My family was going to be picking us up for Thanksgiving (they live about 3 hours away) break and we were going to spend time together on a mini vacation. So I offered to just stay and we could spend Thanksgiving alone together. She said she wasn't going to be here and I had to pry it out of her, but she was going to go fly and visit that guy that she met online. I was devastated. I realized that nothing I said or could do would change anything, but I tried up until my parents knocked on the door to pick me and my son up for Thanksgiving.

Skip ahead to the beginning of December, her sister wanted me to come to their dad's celebration of life party. I said I would go, because I loved their dad. Even though he was a handful, he was still a loving father. So, my SO didn't want her family to think anything was up and she asked me to act like we're still together, because she didn't want to make the event about our problems. I just agreed because I didn't want to start an argument over it.
That night she told me that she had stopped talking to that guy online and that she knew she fucked up and wanted to try to work things out. She said she wasn't in a good place. She was drunk and I didn't want her to get violent, so I just told her that I would sincerely think about it.

That following week my SO attempted suicide in front of me by swallowing over 40+ pills (pain killers, sleep aids, you name it) so I called 911. She was admitted into the hospital and monitored, I couldn't visit her without bawling. She spent the weekend in the psych ward and learned that, while in the ER, she had almost fell into a coma twice and had completely stopped breathing on numerous occasions. She called me sobbing and told me that she didn't want to die, she wanted to live, she wanted to be with me, she wanted to be a mom to my son. I visited her and we talked for about 2 hours about everything. She was diagnosed with severe depression and high anxiety. She was not only pushing me away, but her sister, her best friends, her mom, etc. She didn't want to be around people that KNEW her inside and out. She knew that what she did to me was wrong and that nothing excuses her actions, but she wasn't in a mentally sound state. We decided to work things out, I know it may be stupid, I don't care. I want to see her well and if us trying to rebuild our relationship helps her achieve that, then I'll do it. For the first two weeks it was pretty solid on communication and being open about how things made each of us feel. I learned a lot about just stupid little things that I was doing that she never spoke up about. I've been doing everything that I can to help support her in her recovery.

Now. This brings me to me. Her anti-depressants make her libido go way down to pretty much zero. I'm not even talking about just sex, but just any physical touching, kissing, holding hands, whatever. I've always been the type of person that loves that physical affection. It's something that is tangible, I can't just trust words. If that makes sense?
So, for about two weeks now it's really been getting to me. We used to cuddle every night when we went to sleep and now she doesn't want me touching her. I've lost sleep (only getting about 4 hours a night), I've lost weight(around 15-20 lbs, no pants will stay up), I've gotten irritable, I've lost willpower to do the things that I used to enjoy(art, playing with my son, even video games), and I'm constantly doubting my self worth. I've talked to her about how it makes me feel and she just says that she can't help it because of her medicine. I told her that I can't help that I enjoy the physical touch from her. It's just really eating at me to the point I'm second guessing trying to start over with her.

Sorry for the wall of text, I know it's all over the place but I just needed to get this out.",07Jan2017,1

28,"I had been germ-avoidant for a few years, but it wasn‚Äôt serious or debilitating until this time last year. All eight people in my department had an agonizing, violent cough. I literally watched it cycle around for three months before it cleared up. The more I paid attention, I realized that no one was washing or sanitizing their hands after coughing into them or blowing their noses. They didn‚Äôt think twice about passing around paperwork, touching all the door handles and light switches, etc. I was the only person who didn‚Äôt get sick because I literally sanitized everything that came into my office and made sure to clean my hands if I had to touch anything my coworkers had touched.

My hyper-awareness of the spread of germs and bacteria at work naturally led me to pay attention to the rest of the world. I‚Äôve seen people pick their noses and teeth, cough into their hands, touch the garbage, etc., and then not think twice as they touched shopping carts, cash, restaurant menus‚Äîyou name it. I can go out into the world just fine, but as soon as I‚Äôm back to the safety of my car or home, I sanitize everything‚Äîmy arms if I had to lean on something, my jeans if I had to sit somewhere public, my purse if I had to set it down anywhere. But then my husband would come home from work, holding his germ-covered phone to his face, try to kiss me, then dump his wallet, keys, and mail into the mail basket, and immediately go root around the fridge or touch the TV remote. He agreed to put his wallet and keys into the basket when he comes home, then sanitize his hands and phone before touching anything else, but he‚Äôs often very annoyed by how bad I get (which I totally understand).

I don‚Äôt want to change the way the world works or live in a bubble, but I no matter how hard I try, I can‚Äôt just ignore everything. I realize it‚Äôs beyond excessive, but I know I‚Äôm at least slightly justified in my caution because I haven‚Äôt been sick in 3 or 4 years. To be clear, I‚Äôm not afraid of getting sick and I don‚Äôt watch everything around me like a hawk. It‚Äôs just a low-key awareness in the back of my mind, and I calmly take note of anything I may need to clean when I get home, simply because I don‚Äôt like the idea of other people‚Äôs mucus, food-remnants, gas station bacteria, etc. all over my stuff. I‚Äôm seeing a counselor about it, but he‚Äôs convinced that my physical reactions are the problem that I need to curb. The real problem is that this is instinctual now‚Äîa mental awareness. I can go out and touch everything germy all day and be fine (if I can avoid touching my face), but it‚Äôs the mental awareness that has me cleaning EVERYTHING at the end of the day. He diagnosed me with anxiety, OCD, and depression, and said that if behavioral therapy doesn‚Äôt help, an anxiety medication would. I can maybe see how medication might help reduce the thought and anxiety, but I have a VERY hard time believing that it would make me forget about germs entirely, which is what really needs to happen.

I would really appreciate any advice! Is there a certain amount of time that bacteria lives on various surfaces? Is there a way for me to forget/ignore how disgusting public door handles, etc. are? Is there any kind of coping mechanism that can help me when my coworkers come into my office and touch all over my desk and monitor? Is there anything I can do to be less attentive of the germiness around me?",07Jan2017,0

31,"My family doctor prescribed me Lexapro 3 days ago and Im worried about whether or not i should take it. he wants to see me again in 5 days and will be angry if i dont follow his advice, but tbh i dont know if it will actually make my problems better. I would preffer to treat the underlying causes of my depression (abdoiminal pain, apathy, social dysfunction) than rely on happy pills to trick me into thinking everything is ok. the more research i do the more i find that ssri's are not scientifically proven to combat depression, and that when you get off them you will be worse off than you were before. on top of this i will only be able to see a talk therapist bi-weekly, meaning that any issues i have when i start this medication (depression is said to get worse before it gets better) will be left for me alone to deal with. I do not think my family doctor has a very good understanding of psychology or psychological illness no matter how good he is in other medical areas. My worst nightmare would be to start lexapro and find out that i cannot function without it, thus be enslaved by both the drug and my doctor in an endless cycle of drug use.
if anyone has taken lexapro for a long period of time and then been weaned off of it, can you please share your experiences and suggestions? I am interested in both the short term effects (both good and bad) and the long term effects (also both good and bad). I am afraid of this drug messing me up even more.

32,"Okay, so I had this ex let's call him G. 
G was fucked up, no lie. We dated for 10 months.
I just need to vent about him...
So G and I dated December of 2015
The first 2 months were great... but he lied A LOT. Especially about his ex's.
I talked to one of them and she told me to leave him asap, but I didn't.
Anyway, he would say how he wasn't a virgin and he fucked all 2 out of 3 exs.
Turns out, they were all LDR.
I was a virgin, so I didn't wanna give my v card to him at first bc I didn't know the truth. 
But a month into it and he basically pressured me into it.
So anyway, the first 2 months were okay...
Then the 3rd month he started calling me a name
He called me a whore
Because he was mad
His name was Mexican but he told us his name was something else,  not his real one.
He would get mad if we ever called him by his real name.
He said he was from Spain and would literally PREACH about veganism. 
He thought he was better than anyone else bc he was half ginger or whatever.
He said his fam was from Spain and thus not Mexican.
He was homicidal and wanted to kill and rape
He did kill a cat once
Anyway so he would talk shit about my family bc they're ""Mexican""
And he would talk shit about my brothers bc one is big and the other is skinny and so he would call the skinny one ,M, anorexic and annoying
And the big one Mongolian looking and an annoying voice and fat,etc..
He would also call my mom a fat Bitch, when she was already insecure
I told him many times to stop or to just say it to himself, not to me
Or if he wanted, to actually say it to my family.
Okay so then he would also call me whore,dumb,Bitch,etc...
When he was mad or when things didn't go his way. 
He cheated two times
He would hit me 
He would rape me
I would wake up to his dick in my mouth, he was always trying to fuck me in my sleep.

Everything was too much
I wanted to leave but he'd beg me to stay, I did.

When my dog died, he said he was happy since he was annoying....
It's all too much
He had all my passwords and would log me out many times. 
He would block random people
He would also make anon accounts to threaten or bother people
He never saw anything wrong with his actions
He thought he was perfect.
He was far from.
He beat up his mom also.
He stole in front of my family
He hated the sun, never wanted to be dark bc of it
He hated Mexicans
He hated almost everyone
He was atheist

Thus thought he was better than everyone

I had a feeling he was autistic 
In the end, turns out he was.
It's just like... why? Why did I stay so long and how do I recover from the trauma?

33,"The word psychopath creates fear and for good reason. You don't know what's going through our minds. We think much differently than you do, so much so that doctors say that you wouldn't be able to understand even if you were told. I am here to tell you about my life.

I was never violent as a child. I would happily break a law however. Some people called me a rebel but most everybody loved me. About the age of 13 I got into trouble for doing a crime and was court ordered to attend counseling. The psychiatrist noticed something different about me, some narcissistic qualities, so she wanted to further look at me. About a year later she finally got permission from my mother to do an fMRI. It concluded that I was a psychopath. Now that I've told a little back story let me tell you about a day in my life 11 years later.

I wake up about 6:30am while my wife is getting around, go into my 2 year old daughters room to wake her up and dress her, then I make my way into the kitchen to cook breakfast. My daughter usually eats yogurt and fruit while I eat eggs or pancakes. About 7:15 I kiss my wife and daughter goodbye as they walk out the door then I lay back down until 10am.

At 10am I will shower while listening to music. I have a very eclectic taste when it comes to music listening to metal, pop, and even some edm. After my shower is over I will usually watch T.V. of some kind, I just finished Black Mirror last week. I will normally snack on something at noon and eat lunch on my way to work at 2:30pm.

At work people love me. I make them smile and laugh every single day. That is something I enjoy doing actually, to actually feel that people like me, it's not something I need by any means, just something I enjoy doing. Why I like it though is a very different reason than most. I do it to gain trust, to make people comfortable with me, so if and when the time comes you will do what I want you to. What is it I want? That really depends on the day. Usually sex or money. Unlike most psychopaths I don't necessarily scam people but I do manipulate them and it's quite effortless. My manipulation is merely my mask, they say we wear many masks, but that's not exactly true. While some change personalities based on their surroundings I am a constant, happy go lucky guy. It would be exhausting to change like that and you would be caught onto easier as well.

I am your best friend, I am your neighbor that you can have the wifi password of, I am the coworker that you don't think about until you get to work and once you see me you smile.

Although I have no way to be empathetic or the fact that I can easily manipulate you doesn't make me a bad person. I have no drive to commit a murder and I don't even commit minor crimes anymore. I am just simply here.",07Jan2017,21
