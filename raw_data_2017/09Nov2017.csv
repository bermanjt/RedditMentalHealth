2,"I thought I took enough pills to kill myself last night, but here I am. My life is a complete mess. I am going to fail my college classes because I haven't showed up to school in a couple weeks because I have been able to get out of bed to go to class. I have a 20 hour a week retail job that doesn't pay nearly enough to survive. It's literally been the only job I've been able to keep more than two months in my entire life though. My parents are finally about to drop the hammer on me and I'm about to kick me out of the house. I got no friends or family that will take me in, I also don't have any way of being able to support myself. I have been diagnosed bipolar by a mental institution, however I have never have had proper therapy or meds outside of that mental institution which was only for 2 weeks. I can't even afford to get to therapy or medications. My insurance doesn't cover shit for mental health, and I cannot afford even the copay. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm really wondering if I should just die or maybe I should try again since I somehow survived?",09Nov2017,2
3,"Current situation: I've been seeing a therapist about once a week for about 4 months. I don't feel like he is very good during our sessions. He hasn't done anything seriously wrong, he's just ""okay.""


In our last session he hinted that our sessions might be coming to an end. Every month I have to fill out a questionnaire for him where I rate things on a scale from 0-5. For example. Statement: ""I feel like I might lose control and hurt someone."" Answer range-- 0: This is not like me at all; 5: this is exactly like me. etc.


The system he uses creates a score for the patient based on their numerical responses to the questionnaire, and I guess thats how he measures the progress he's making with clients. However, I've been lying on every one of those questionnaires, because I don't want anything in my record about my suicidal thoughts and feelings. I also haven't recorded on the questionnaires how I sometimes get extremely angry and want to hurt people who have wronged me... Note: I've never been arrested for anything in my life, I have no criminal record and have never engaged in criminal activity. I just have extreme rage towards people who have wronged me unfairly.


So, in our last session he hinted that my rating has improved, and because of that our sessions might be coming to an end soon.


Here's the thing. I am still suffering from depression. In our last session he insinuated that what I'm experiencing is sadness, not depression. He is absolutely wrong on this. I know what I am experiencing. I have had depression my entire life, starting from the age of 3. I'm 29 now. My depression has become manageable during the past month (since I've started taking antidepressant medication for the first time), but I am nowhere near ""cured."" I don't think depression can ever be cured.


Also, if he's measuring the progress we've made by the numerical score, then he's way off base because my scores are not accurate. He doesn't seem to be aware of this


What should I do? I don't want to continue seeing this particular person, but I could like to continue therapy with someone else. I've been getting free therapy sessions through the university I attend, so I'd like to switch to someone else in the department there. How should I go about doing that? I know in my heart of hearts that I still need therapy. I don't have any friends, my family lives in a different state, and my family is highly dysfunctional. I don't have good relationships with anyone in my family. My mother has narcissistic personality disorder &amp; paranoid delusions, and my dad has depression. So, I don't have any friends--literally, no friends. Nobody who I hang out with. All I have is my boyfriend (we live together) and my dog. I'll sometimes see his family, 2 or 3 holidays out of the year. We see his mom about once a month.


I spend most of my time alone when I'm not at school. I also don't have a job right now... I haven't been able to work because of extreme anxiety and depression. I think its irresponsible of my therapist to want to end our sessions based on some bullshit number, considering the state my life is in right now. I haven't lied about how I don't have any friends or how I'm jobless. I haven't lied to him about how strained the relationships are in my family.


Also--something that's bothered me for a while... My parents were abusive to me the entire time I lived with them. They were emotionally, psychologically, and physically abusive (but not sexually abusive, thank goodness). I want to work through all of my personal problems resulting from my traumatic childhood. I also have several traumatic events from my teenage years and ages 20-26 that I would like to work through. However, my current therapist doesn't seem remotely interested in discussing any of this. The last time I tried to talk about it, all he had to say was ""its time to close the book"" on the past. How the fuck can I do that without dealing with my problems?


Is it standard procedure for therapists not to want to talk about traumas from the past? This guy only seems interested in talking about whatever happens to come up in conversation that day. Like, he'll ask me ""how was your weekend? do anything fun?"" and whatever my answers are will be the jumping off point for that session... if I bring up anything about my parents being abusive, he doesn't want to talk about it, and just says I should let go of the past and move on.


Advice?


If you're going to respond ""be honest with him,"" well there's a reason I haven't been honest. 1. I don't trust him, I've been waiting to see if he's trustworthy. 2. I sure as shit don't want it recorded in an official capacity that I have suicidal thoughts and tendencies


The law in the state I live in (I live in the USA) says that doctor/patient confidentiality must be broken if the patient reveals that any person's life might potentially be in jeopardy.. so if I told my therapist about my suicidal thoughts, he would NOT keep it confidential, and I'm not sure how the state would intervene in my life, but I'm sure it would suck.",09Nov2017,1

6,"I have severe BDD (body dsymorphic disorder) I focus on my physical appearance to the point where I waste entire hours/days staring into mirrors, at flaws that are not there or barely noticeable to others.

I had acne growing up and my mom always told me to wear makeup. I think that is where my BDD started. In fact, I'm blonde and my mom would have me wear makeup at a very young age to ""bring out my features."" I hated my freckles at 12 and she bought me a bleaching cream. ( i never used it btw) but all of her actions reconfirmed my fears that I was ""gross"" bc she obviously wouldn't do this if I wasn't right? Anyways, I know she thought she was helping bc her mom wouldn't let her wear makeup, shave her legs etc... she wanted to give me what she didn't have.. but I think this did so much damage. I have yet to leave the house without some makeup since I was 11. I am 25 now.

I used to pick my skin, constantly dye/cut my hair. Try tanning/creams for freckles. So many different things that my mom always supported bc she ""thought it made me feel better about myself"" when really, it made me feel like I wasn't like anyone else.

To this day I feel like I don't look human. I feel like when I get ready, I am putting on a ""disguise"" to look human. Not like I look like a damn dragon, but not like the rest of humanity. Disgusting to be honest.

I know I am not though. I have always had boyfriends that were very attractive and I was always the ""pretty one"" in the group. But I feel like that is only because I disguise myself as human. Constantly fixing flaws so no one can see how disgusting I truly am.

I'm such a feminist and love body positivity and support girls who don't shave, wear makeup etc.. but I AM NOT that. I follow American beauty standards to a T every day. I feel like if I don't, everyone will abandon me and my life will be over. I hate being so fake. I love my character and everything about myself but I CANNOT celebrate my appearance. I destroy it.

I have spent thousands of dollars, and honestly most of my spending money on beauty products and cosmetic procedures. Even going into debt when I was 18 when I was able to do what I want without a parent. I have compromised  what I believe in just so I can relieve this horrible burden I feel. I constantly refer to this feeling as a ""body prison.""

Sometimes I stare in the mirror at night while my boyfriend sleeps and just think ""what the fuck is wrong with you why are you so disgusting"" and just stare and stare at my flaws and google how to fix them.

I know I sound so vain but I'm not. I wouldn't care how I looked if I thought my looks weren't non human. I just think I look so gross and weird compared to anyone else and I hate it.

When I get into my OCD thoughts over my BDD, I try to tell myself, YOU KNOW YOU HAVE BDD GO TO SLEEP STOP STARING AND GOING CRAZY, but then I just look at my flaws again and think ""these flaws have to be real though! I SEE THEM.""

Ugh idk what I'm looking for here. I guess anyone that can share their expierence so I don't feel so alone?

And if anyone can give some advice how to get over this?

I've seen a therapist before, but for other trauma in my past. I never brought up the BDD because I feel like SHE will realize how ugly I am or validate my fears? I guess a fear of rejection that she will say ""you are disgusting but stop being so vain and get over it?""

So any advice would mean the world. Or just share your experiences.

Thank you if you read all this :)",09Nov2017,3
7," started graduate school this past summer with a major in Teaching and Curriculum specializing in Teaching English as a Second Language. The workload was so intense my first semester because summer classes are shorter than regular fall and spring semester. This fall semester I am taking 15 credit hours plus I have begun to complete 100 hours of field work. 
Things came to ahead yesterday when my university's teaching placement advisor sent me an email which instructed to me to call her immediately. I called her and she informed me that my field experience has been suspended. I was suspended because I was using a laptop in one of the classes I was in. I was sitting in the front of the class and the administrator who was in the class found it distracting. The administrator called the placement supervisor at my university yesterday afternoon. The placement supervisor scheduled a meeting for the next morning which was today. It was with her along with my academic advisor and the supervising teacher who is assigned to advise me during my field experience.
At the meeting, I was given a good talking to about what I should and should not do at a student teaching assignment and now I have to wait and see if I can continue to go to the high school I was in or wait get another placement.
I have been working so hard for months, and it has been doing nothing but making me miserable, exhausted and stressed. I don't even know if I want to continue this program. I feel like it is doing nothing but holding me back from real life experience. I stopped working so I could focus on school full time but now I just feel like quitting grad school and just start looking for work. I have a bachelor's already so I should be able to find something without having to do anymore extra schooling. I am depressed by this entire situation. I feel so lost and insecure over all this mess. ",09Nov2017,3

It didn’t come out of nowhere, it was a long battle for him and for a couple of years he was trying everything he could, from marijuana to therapy to shock treatment.

11,"You’ve heard those common phrases, “someone cares about you” or to “reach out, PM me”.

I, and possibly you, may have wondered, “how does anyone know my circumstance?” Or maybe thought that the world around me doesn’t care, or that I’ve isolated myself to a point where no one would listen to me, or really give me emotion. Why should some stranger who doesn’t know *my* life tell me that someone cares? 

People fucking care. 

It’s beyond “life matters.”
 It’s about the person behind the screen relating, feeling empathy.
They want desperately for you to be able to take a moment off from your head wanting to eat its self, for a way to escape the head space that for one of any reasons, just isn’t hospitable right now. 
It’s the long disconnected friend remembering the memories or even one simple experience you shared a while ago.
Emotions can suck sometimes, and it’s within empathy to be able to wish that the suck go away for another human.

My friend isolated herself, starting at the onset of her depression. She was prescribed Zoloft, and until after she died, I didn’t even know this. 

It wasn’t my place to know. But this extends further than her mental health status. I had literally not had a meaningful exchange with her in the three months before she took her life.  I kept meaning to get in contact, but she had isolated herself so well that I couldn’t find any avenue to reach her. I’m going to regret that until I die too.

Why is this relevant? 

I know isolating yourself can be easy. Wether it’s unintentional or intentional, the reasoning to spare your friends grief, or a result of being socially un able at the moment,  it’s all to easy to let people and relationships slip away.

But if you’re allowing that to keep you from talking to somebody or just discussing your feelings, dude. Please don’t.

There’s a reason talk therapy is so overwhelmingly effective for most times of duress. 
It get your feelings out, makes you articulate them, and come to terms. It might mean sinking even lower, opening up to the idea that some actions of yours were not the best solution to a certain problem. Sometimes, it hurts like a bitch. Sometimes, it feels like the opening of a new world, a weight lifted. 
But if you feel out and ask someone if you could discuss some feelings, 9/10 times the person is not going to be an unemotional dick. 
They can be a sounding board, someone with advice, or simply an ear to rant on. If he/she is insensitive, come to the reddit community. Even though we may not know you, we know what self hatred and other emotions makes someone feel like. 
r/suicidewatch is one of the most supportive groups of people ever. Dumping your feelings is one of the best feelings ever, even if it feels like ripping your guts out. Having someone listen is like being redeemed in your feelings. In fact, it is.

So I freaking beg you, if you’ve isolated yourself and are feeling especially shitty, or simply just shitty please talk. Chat with an old friend. Talk to anyone with half a heart, because you don’t know how it will turn out. It can either give you a refreshed start or realization. It’s an effort that’s holistically worth it.

Most people want to be there for the people they talk to everyday. 
It’s innate, down to the primitive culture of having the other guy’s back during the night watch. 
If my friend had reached out, god knows I couldn’t do anything other than hug her and be there for her, but that’s a damn lot better than going through this shit alone.

PM me if you ever need anything

15,"I have a lot going on in my life. I failed high school, didn’t graduate and I haven’t gotten my GED yet but obviously it isn’t an option. I am definitely going to have to get it. Just before school ended I got my first job as a server at a restaurant I still currently work at. A few months into the job I found out my dad had cancer. The stress and anxiety of everything got to me and I couldn’t handle my job besides being new. I was pulled into the office and written up because of angry tables that had walked out. A few days later it happened again only I didn’t get written up because I broke down crying and explained to them what was going on in my life and surprisingly they sympathized. Soon I stopped serving and became a cook in the kitchen and I got food at my job but the stress of life kept going because that’s life. My boyfriend lives 3,000 miles away, we’re in an LDR, so that’s stressful but we’re more ham happy together and me and my dad wanna move out there, me more so than him. A few months have gone by and my dads health is getting better but my mental health is getting worse. I’ve only talked to my boyfriend about it because he’s really my only friend anymore and I’m not comfortably talking to my dad about it and I can’t force myself to tell him. I have to be comfortably or it could worsen my health.  Tonight I picked up a server shift after months because to be honest I need the money. It didn’t go too bad, no angry tables, maybe 1 but nothing horrible. But I just felt so utterly worthless and inadequate. My anxiety really flared up tonight and I can’t stop crying. I haven’t been happy at all lately. I’m always either mad or sad and the only times I’m happy are when I’m talking to my boyfriend or joking with coworkers but I don’t have anything in between.  Like you know when your home comfortable watching tv or something and you’re happy, not overjoyed but just content. I don’t have that anymore. My only happiness is in jokes and instances where even the most depressed would be happy. I don’t have any organic happiness anymore.  And I can’t seek medical help because I don’t know how to drive and my dad is he only person who could drive me and I am really uncomfortable with telling him right now. I just don’t know what to do anymore. ",09Nov2017,1

21,"I read so many horror stories about Effexor (I am taking 150mg split into two pills) and I wanted to post a positive experience.

It's been about a week, but by now I'm usually thrashed with brain zaps and diarrhea. Effexor was tough the first 4 days--high anxiety, nausea (I actually called in to work), and dizziness.

It's been a week and I feel... normal. I actually went out with some friends the other day and had fun. I did drink a long island iced tea and like others have reported, it hit me kind of hard. But no nausea, etc. I'd like to up the dosage to see if I can fully control my anxiety but uh... yeah.

I've also lost 7 pounds. This is likely because I don't really eat much now. I was too sick the first two days, but now I've found I get fuller faster and don't crave sugar. So no brain zaps, no dizziness, no nausea, no diarrhea. My body seems to be jiving with the Effexor. I also work nights so I just kind of take it whenever, but split the pills by at least 8 hours. No ill effects.

I have tried Viibryd, BuSpar, Wellbutrin, Prozac, and hydroxyzine. All have had varying shitty side effects. Viibryd caused horrid brain zaps and diarrhea, and it made me extremely sleepy/caused weight gain. BuSpar made me extremely dizzy. Wellbutrin just didn't do anything. Prozac made my nose bleed and made me agitated. Hydroxyzine caused horrible dry throat and left me feeling exhausted for days.",09Nov2017,1

25,"I can’t remember for how long I’ve felt like this. I want to keep it short so I’ll just say I’ve been through a lot of shit- bullying since I was 7 (schoolmates,teachers,parents). Puking in the bathroom because of stress then going to the classroom to make jokes about everything and anything to be liked to be less vulnerable. It’s cooler to control the laughs. Going to sleep crying. Waking up and being afraid of going to school. The boys I liked and tried to hide it from them being disgusted by me and treating me like I am a monster. I was taking a lot of steroids along with other medication back then because I had a problem with my lungs and was very often ill-so that made me chubby. I was mocked for that of course but I learned to take it as a joke and laugh with them. Later I lost the weight but I never liked myself.I did very well on my entrance exams and could go anywhere I wanted so I moved to a new school hoping it will be better. Now I hate the school and it’s hard for me to be there one day without feeling overwhelmed by the 30+ people in the room, loud noises, neon lights that are too bright. I go to the toilet to be alone if I feel sick during class. I don’t puke anymore because the stress isn’t so much so that is good. I don’t really have friends. I have people who I communicate with during class but once school Is over they don’t want to do anything with me. They say they are scared of me and that I am weird, “ you are like and alien/robot who is pretending to be human”. I know that they hate me and I freak them out because ‘’it looks like I am faking all my emotions and only get happy when we are about to eat”.They compare me to Sheldon Cooper which I think is just saying “you are a socially awkward asshole”. I try not to be but I always offend people without knowing what I said was offensive. The thing is now I am a binger. I stuff my face until my stomach hurts and then I eat some more because I can’t deal with my feelings any other way. I used to throw up after that but after a very scary incident happened (won’t go into details) I stopped. But I can’t stop overeating and I have been trying for a year now. My body is turning horrible again and it makes me want to starve myself until I am numb. People always say ‘’talk to family,talk to friends,get help’’ . Can’t do that. Family is part of the problem. Dad is very abusive and manipulative and uses my issues against me. Mom never trusts me and starts screaming at me if I try to open up to her. With friends as I already stated,we are not that close and I can’t really trust them. Therapist I tried talking to but she was very condescending and was getting angry at me because “I was too cold and distant,trying to rationalize my emotions” ; didn’t look her in the eyes..and  somehow she made me more anxious. I hurt myself straight after sessions. We don’t have a school counselor and I can’t go to another one because here they are expensive as hell.

I am feeling very depressed again. Binging, skipping school, having anxiety attacks and panic attacks, hating myself because I am unable to focus and actually do my work. I wake up shaking and crying sometimes. I feel so alone and I think it’s all my fault because I am  worthless and undeserving of love and can’t do anything right.

The only thing I truly want (and failing at this scares me more than anything) is to become a doctor so that I can make people’s lives better. I love the science in it too and the profession as a whole. Now I am studying for med school entrance tests and lately I am completely unable to focus. I know I am intelligent enough to ace them but I feel there is a barrier between what I am doing now and what I can do which I so far have failed to overcome. I want to be able to study but I feel so anxious and lethargic I complete only half of my work despite trying for hours. The brain fog, the toughts, the constant emptiness which somehow feels heavy (???) all get to me and I am beginning to lose hope. Which I don’t want to happen again because it has happened before. I’ve been suicidal and I don’t want to go back to that state and I am horrified because I don’t know what  to do and how to help myself.

27,"Hi everyone,

I landed in this sub because I need help finding the right words. I am sorry if this sounds silly or if I included too much unnecessary information.

To cut a long story short, life has been pretty rough on me and it got worse in the past 3 years or so. There was an illness, relationship problems, crazy family members, traumatising surgery, and more. Because of all of this I am currently in a pretty bad place mentally and physically, and the two keep fueling each other. 

I am in a relationship and we have been living together since a year. In this one year our intimacy has significantly deteriorated, and it wasn't very good before either. I tried to talk about it multiple times but I think that we reached and impass and I seriously think that I need professional help in this area.

I live in the Netherlands, which is not my native country. In effort to help myself I managed to see a psychologist (not an easy task) and I had already 3 appointments with her, which we spent ""diagnosing"" me and looking for possibilities for a treatment. She decided to use a burnout treatment framework, although thinks that it's not exactly what is happening. I trust her and want to try what she proposed. 

My specific issue is that in the interview I did not tell her about the intimacy problem. I described my SO as a great, supportive person, which is true, only the bedroom stuff sucks and all my attempts to make it better were futile. I think about it all the time but I don't have to confidence to bring it up to the doctor and I fear that it might jeopardise the treatment.

What I want to do next is to ask her to send me to another specialist (sexuologist?) with whom I could focus only on this issue. I am extremely embarassed to talk about it and that's why I want to prepare what I have to say before I see her. Could anyone here help me with that?",09Nov2017,2

The meh feeling is being really tired emotionally and mentally but not caring enough to do anything about it.

39,"I have severe anxiety and depression.

When the stress is too much for me, I freak out in such a way that I find it a little weird. If I'm in public, I'll want to go to the nearest place where I can be alone. If I'm downstairs, I'll want to go to my room. Which is normal for me.

However, since around 3 months ago, when I stress too much I have to be in silence or I'll freak out more. I then go to my room, close the curtains, turn off the lights, take off my glasses so I can't see, curl into a ball under my covers and press them onto my closed eyes so no light gets through. If I don't do this, it's extremely uncomfortable and unbearable.

41,"Hi, I have a close family member who had a very hard childhood. Lost parents etc. About two years ago this person started withdrawing and was not able to function at all. 

Currently, this person takes care of themselves, in all their daily parts of life, eating, laundry etc. Has a job and functions.

However, it seems that a part of their brain is turned off. In highschool this person got As on math without studying, could participate in class 50% of the time and get As. Now in college, this person is getting 50s on the math tests, and when it comes to sitting and taking the test this person says it feels it needs 7 hours.

My question is, what could be going on in the brain, and can it ever get better.",09Nov2017,1
42,"4 years ago I suffered terribly from depression as a result of OCD and anxiety disorders. 2 years ago I moved to a different country for work. 1 year and a half ago was the last time I felt bad and I stopped taking meds.

For the last 2 days I've felt like crap. Very anxious, not eating much, feel miserable. I dunno if I'm slipping towards OCD and depression again, (for anyone familiar with OCD, they'll know the thought process about constant fears and how we ruminate).

But I've also had a hard time recently. I'm very homesick and I haven't seen my family in nearly 2 years, I live in a country with a different language to my own, the winter here has just started and it's dark and cold, I changed jobs recently and have found myself working from home more with much more free time than before, overall I feel rather lonely as I have no partner and my best friends are back home, I've had a physical injury for the last month and haven't been able to workout, I went crazy last weekend in the city and drank a full bottle of cheap vodka (my own fault).

I'm hoping that it's just a temporary thing and won't go full blast. What do you think? Am I slipping or is this just a temporary blimp? I'm going to try going for a jog now cos I got cleared by a doctor just yesterday for my injury. ",09Nov2017,1

44,"My girlfriend is a very smart, high function girl. She is currently in medical school. 

She suffers from general anxiety, almost anything can somehow upset her. 

Things were really good for the first few months, I knew about the anxiety and stuff, and just figured it was typical. These days, things have changed. The littlest things can set her off, she goes quiet, and then I know she's upset. Then I ask her about it and it turns into, not a fight, but a disagreement. I get that things I may say are ""the littlest thing"" may not be so little to her, but trust me when I say the littlest thing. 

It's starting to get frustrating dealing with this because I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells and have to censor myself because if I said how I actually feel then it causes her to become upset. When she becomes upset, I then have to apologize, and basically concede my own feelings so that it'll help her calm down. 

The last month or so I think I've made her cry like three times for the most ridiculous reasons. It's this vicious cycle where either she says something and my reply upsets her, or something I say upsets her, and then we go in circles until she cries and says she feels ashamed and that she's going to end up pushing me away. 

An example of something that upset her: She asked me if there was anything I thought she should talk to the counsellor (she visits with him once a month) about. I said that she should talk to him about the similar things she has been, trying to avoid letting smaller (poor choice of words, of course) things upset her so much. She replies ""smaller things being the things you say, or the way you say them"". I said, you know what, you should talk to him about whatever you feel is best and most important. Whatever will help you the most. She proceeds to say things that mean she is upset, so I apologize and say that I worded it poorly and try to move on. Nope. Not that easy. She's upset and it comes back around to the fact that I said something, she get's upset, and there's no easy way to move on from it. She's ""shook"", her mood is shot, it's over. 

I don't know what to do, and I am getting very frustrated. We are talking about moving in together, but I am truthfully a little scared because of all this. 

Can anyone give me any advice here? I'm lost and don't know what to do. I know about all these issues, so I try to do as much for her as I can, and be as good a man to her as I can. We are from a bit different socioeconomic classes, so sometimes she looks down on some of my thinking/things I do/etc. But I am generally thoughtful of her and her feelings/emotions/etc. 

Sorry for the lack of formatting here, I don't know how to do this that well. Also, sorry for the long post. 

TLDR;
- I say things (the sky is blue, water makes things wet,etc)
- Girlfriend gets upset, let's them shift her mood
- I apologize and have to backtrack
- Rinse and repeat",09Nov2017,1

My husband is battling some depression/anxiety/substance abuse.
He was prescribed antidepressants from our family doctor about 7 months ago. His prescription has been changed &amp; adjusted several times. Our doctor advised us to look into a therapist/psychiatrist to further diagnose and evaluate my husbands problems.

I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out what to do. I've tried finding a psychiatrist through our insurance network and have had no luck. Our family doctor is currently out of his office for an unspecified time so i cannot get a referral from him.

I guess I just need guidance on if we should find a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist. My husband was hoping to find someone he can meet with 1 or 2 times a week who can help figure out his dosage. All I seem to be finding is intensive in patient care. Any suggestions on where to start? I'm in the US. Thank you.",09Nov2017,1
46,"Since my cousin died 10 years ago I suffered depression and anxiety while being relentlessly bullied everyday. When I reached high school my mental health changed. I started having hallucinations and my anxiety and depression worsened and my mood swings were everywhere. For 7 years I went in and out of hospitals getting kicked out saying I was overreacting. I went to 6 different doctors looking for answers and none helped me. Instead they said I had schizophrenia and treated me for it. Yet the pills never helped and every time I told them that they raised them. This summer I went in debt 4 grand in one week by ""helping"" someone I thought needed it. Since then I've been going in and out of hospitals and trying so hard for answers why I am this way and want to give up. I finally went to a new doctor today and instead of talking for 5-10 mins she talked for 40. She then told me what it was all these years I was struggling and battling with was bipolar disorder. All the factors pointed at it and as bad as bipolar is I feel a sense of relief and peace that I finally know after wanting to know for years. I know I will struggle greatly still but now I know where I can find support for bipolar and she also gave me a nurse to check me weekly.

48,"Hey guys. I am not sure what it is but there is something definitely off with me. I am a guy in late 20's, single and lives in one of metro cities of India. I feel sad/angry/frustrated most of the times. Not able to feel happy for long now, smile and laughter are mostly fake and are for the sake of daily life situations. There are few things which I want to discuss:

I don't know how to have fun. I just don't. Earlier it was gaming, movies, series that used to be fun but nothing appeals anymore. Specially after breakup(about 7 months ago).

I feel helpless and as if I am mere surviving and not really living. Worst part is I don't know how can I change that. I don't seem to have dreams anymore. I had just one dream- to emigrate for studies and experience life in foreign land. Now it's not possible due to fucked academics and age.

Staying alone sucks for me, staying with people sucks for them. I don't know what to say and what not at most of the times. I have become socially awkward even though I am socially active as I stay mostly in my head, irrespective of my physical presence.

I have tried 'Vipasana', but not able to concentrate anymore in the practice. I am not able keep my focus for long. It may be anxiety. 

I am missing the energy, the spark that is required in life. I walk a mellowed down, tired walk, which even I am starting to hate. I have started workout though.

Does it sound like a tensed phase of life, or something is really off with me? Should I seek professional help? suggest some in Delhi-NCR please. Thanks.",09Nov2017,1

53,"I'm in the middle of a debilitating bout of anxiety and I'm so tired of all these artists creating art compilations of mental illnesses- like drawing a house 15 different ways to represent 15 different mental illnesses. First of all, they have no idea how 15 different mental illnesses should be represented unless they're the most unfortunate person in the world. They're drawing the stereotype of each illness, fueling the flames of misunderstanding. And my medical issue is not for a random person to be interpreting. If you're a sufferer of one mental illness it does not give you the right to represent all the others.

And I certainly don't like the idea of a non-sufferer seeing this poorly thought out art by someone who has no idea what my illness feels like and thinking they've somehow come closer to understanding the illness. I'm probably being a scrooge with all this but I really have a chip on my shoulder about it. ",09Nov2017,8

56,"I had a breakdown four years ago after doing some kundalini yoga. Since then I've had phrases repeating in my head (not voices, just phrases). Its usually just stuff people around me have said, lines from songs, stuff off the tv, just mental junk really that happens in my environment. But the phrases are there constantly, night or day. They have never once completely stopped. They even happen when I'm sleeping. Often I can tune them out but they are always there in the background, repeating in the same sequence every time. Could this be an issue with my declarative memory? Or does it count as being psychosis, even though I'm not hallucinating in any way? One doctor has diagnosed psychosis, one has diagnosed OCD/intrusive thoughts (as a result of these symptoms, I now have a fear of obscene/rude words and phrases...I'm afraid they'll start repeating in my head with the rest of the crap my brain repeats). I can't shake the suspicion that the issue is a cognitive one, rather than a psychological one - mainly because it's just so constant and NOTHING gets rid of it. No one seems to understand that I'm not doing anything to cause these phrases to play in my mind. They just spontaneously appear. Has anyone ever come across this before? What does it sound like to you? Would there be any point in getting a brain scan? Thanks for reading! ",09Nov2017,3
57,"Because I see these things wrong with me. The flaws exist. The most I can come to accept is that the flaws exist, but maybe people don't notice them as much as I feel they do. I feel like the average person doesn't specifically study my face to try to figure out what is wrong with it, but when they see me, I look unattractive because my face is lopsided. They may not consciously think to themself, ""she is ugly cause half her face is slanted"" but they think ""she is ugly."" I have frequented at /r/rateme and people have confirmed the things I see wrong with me. I obsess over my physical appearance to a disgusting degree, and my family tells me that I care too much about looks. First, that is easy for them to say, because I turned out to be the ugly duckling of the family. I have the ugly features. None of them have jaw that make have their face look slanted or an eye that droops a bit more than the other. Their ears aren't severely crooked. It literally looks like half my face was squished down when being born or something. I obsess over it. I feel like people don't want to associate with me because I'm not pretty. I've heard people who talk about just accepting the fact that they aren't attractive, but this distresses me. I spend so much time taking pictures of myself and photoshopping them to see what my face would look like if it was symmetrical. I spend so much time researching plastic surgery, rather than productive things like studying, working out, going out with friends, or reading a book. Even if my features weren't attractive, I wish they were at least symmetrical. Asymmetry is so much more expensive to fix surgically. Some if it can't even. I believe that I'm less valuable of a person because I'm not attractive. I don't see other people and think they are less valuable because they aren't attractive, so maybe I should try to think like that? But this is my life. I'm not living their life. If I was them, I'd probably obsess over it too. It's just too true that people prefer to talk to the pretty girl. At least at first. Maybe she has a shit personality.

I had a suicidal episode 2 years back but since I've been on meds nothing, until recently. Also I just got 2 different surgeries within the past month (one for foot one for hemorrhoids) and they have been causing me pain. So here's the situation. I'm not feeling depressed but more like bored. I'm bored with life in general. For the past two days I've imagined doing extreme things and just stopping my life and this boredom. Never acting on it but pictures in the head (if that makes since). I work, I eat, I sleep. I try to lose weight and feel better but that's either coming slowly or not at all. I know I'm lonely. I've lived in the area I'm in for a little over a year but I don't know anybody. I moved because of a great job offer but all my friends and family are in different states. Thing is I'm still not looking for their company. I don't know what I'm looking for but everything is boring me and I'm just tired all the time. I can sleep for an entire day if I felt like it. I hide in my office at work and don't have the energy I had when I first started. I can push myself but what's the use? Again I still feel happy but it's the same routine day in and day out. I'm no longer proactive I'm reactive. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest. Maybe it is depression but it feels different from that. I don't know. What do you suggest I guess?
