0,"So this situation in particular actually just happened, but I've begun to have similar incidents over the past few months as I've been adjusting to the college life as a freshman. Also I was diagnosed with mild social anxiety within the past year, apparently not enough to medicate though. I'm still a little iffy on that part, but this might just be my last straw before going to someone about medicating this.

Ok so the situation in question:
I'm out to dinner with my mom and her fiancé (home for the weekend). I'm thinking my normal thoughts, maybe feeling ironically like a bit of a third wheel, (we had gone mini-golfing beforehand) until the end of the meal when I start thinking about this girl I've taken a bit of interest in at college. Clearly a mistake. At this point I start to feel generally uncomfortable. I start to wonder how/if I will ever have a real relationship with someone if I am too anxious to put myself out there. I start issuing social cues that I'd like to leave. I get in the car with them. My first thought is ""Please don't talk to me I just want to go home."" Luckily, there wasn't too much conversation. I am still very uncomfortable, as if something very bad has happened or is about to happen. As we get home I am the first one in the door. I walk briskly, straight up to my room and shut the door. By this point, I am breathing shallowly. I sit at my desk, my thoughts mostly consisting of generic fear and a particularly melancholic song I have stuck in my head. I have the sensation of trembling, but I don't notice it when I hold out my arm. Moving forward, I'm now laying on my bed with my face in the sheets, my inner voice screaming in pain and unfounded fear louder and louder (sounds dark, I know), until all of this suddenly stops. And I'm fine. And I'm here typing this post. 

I'm not looking for a diagnosis by any means, but all  research I've done online implies that if it were a panic attack there should be more things like chest pain and fear of death and whatnot going on. I just want to know I'm not crazy and to validate myself before I go running off taking up the time of a medical professional. Probably something to do with my social anxiety. Who'd'a thought?",22Oct2017,2

I feel like everyone thinks I'm strange when I have no idea what I'm doing wrong, and when I do ask what I've done, everyone thinks it's funny.

3,"Hi Everyone, 

My names Andy, from Australia and I have mental health issues. 

Quite serious ones. I compare it to addiction - it never goes away, you just learn how to accept that it's true and do the work it takes to manage it. 

So I started a company and what we want to do is provide mental health solutions for mankind, and we think we have discovered scalable ways of doing it and we think...maybe....maybe maybe...we can do it all for free. 

So I guess this is just announcing what we're doing. We obviously need support and I'd 100% love to hear from anyone, and I can share as much as I can about what we're doing...or just shoot the shit about what its like to have mental illness. 

Thanks :)

6,"Since about eleven I've been diagnosed with one thing or another. This led to repression of certain parts of my personality through not being able to solve the issue through psychological drug measures. You know, the whole shebang of ""give the kid drugs and it'll fix him"".

This led to me repressing a good portion of my sexuality and emotions due to unfortunate timing of drug administration, highly incompetent psychologists and personnel failings at being able to express my personnel feelings about the above. And really, now at 24 I've realised that due to yeas of self repression I really don't know how to actually feel. I don't know how to really be angry, sad, loving or anything really. My inability to process feelings has destroyed several relationships and I pretty much never talk to family due to this.

It's starting to affect my professional life as well. I think my high aversion to psychological professionals is exacerbating this issue, and I'm really looking for advice on how to approach this. I realize I have a serious issue and want to fix this. My profession looks down upon those who need this sort of help. It delays your  career massively.

Like most in my profession I think I may have an issue with alcohol abuse, but I only feel strong emotions when I'm using alcohol. And it's an addictive feeling. The world seems duller without strong love, joy and hate among other emotions. I just can't seem to bring myself to experience them without it. It worries me as I don't want to develop a alcohol dependence like my mother and her father before her, but Tue emotions while I'm under the influence are just so strong compared to the apathy I feel all the time.

I just don't know how to approach this issue. Any help is appreciated.",22Oct2017,2
7,"I was just recently diagnosed with severe depression and moderate anxiety, and have been taking an anti-depressant for 4 days now (so far so good). The doc also recommend psychotherapy. I found one after a lot of research and talked to her on the phone; she sounds very nice and I'm looking forward to talking to her. But I'm getting really nervous. I'm terrible at communicating/interacting with people and I'm afraid that once I'm there I'll freeze and have absolutely nothing to say or talk about. Or I'm worried that my problems aren't bad enough to be seeing her. What has been your experience with therapy for depression/anxiety/etc? I'm really hoping it goes well.",22Oct2017,3
8,"So I was wondering about this. I don't know if there is a word for it or anything of that nature. However...to preference:

I am a cisgender male, heterosexual 
I am in my late 30's I have recently been put back on wellbutrin for the past month to battle depression, additional symptoms caused by depression, and to see if it will help out with my ADHD without going on an additional stimulate like adderall.

As many people go through, I have issues. The last year of my life was probably up there with the worst years of my life. However the drugs that I am on have helped me get through times of crippling depression when I have these types of thoughts, thoughts of self reflection, or the lack of self.

I've been taking online courses to finish my degree. My one professor and I have been trading emails back and forth in chat talking about various things that stem from the idea of online schooling and the issues I have with it. 

However it has lead into more thought provoking things that I haven't even mention to them in regards to the our conversation. 
It got me thinking, in the sense of over all of my life.

People that talk to me have told me things such as being smart, loyal, creative, genuine, etc, all the good things you can pretty much be (the ones that say good looking are all married so they don't count). I mean these are all great things to be... but what is my identity of self.

See, during the conversation with the professor I had told them that when it comes down to learning, everything I've learned has been thrown at me either via entertainment or just general news to keep informed. I don't ever research for research's sake. If I read something, it's for entertainment. Which is odd because while I would read my history books in high school like novels, actually picking up a history books for reports bored me to tears.

However hearing a friend talk about he was amazed about a specific part of the 3rd Crusade gets me excited because the friend is excited, and I wind up retaining that information. I don't go and hunt for more.

Everything I ""learn"" almost always is about my job or school when I'm forced to research. Anything else I know comes from what comes at me via trying to entertain myself while listening to others talk about what they are interested in.

This started a crisis of sorts and I started to think, ""What about me is actually ME and not anyone else. What have I done in like that I have enjoyed or been enlightened because it was something that I wanted to do on my own and no friend or person I looked up to or teacher or boss or anyone talked to me about...there has to be something.""

I couldn't find anything.

The closest thing anyone had said to what I was feeling was ""So it sounds like you're worried that your identity has depended more on vicarious living than self introspection/assessment.""""

I was talking about this with friends. One of my friends said he hates baseball, but when he goes out with one of his friends who really likes baseball to a game he enjoys himself and watching the game because of the people and the environment and everything like that.

Another friend said he was like that with football and being around his friends that watched football etc.

See, in my case with that, not only would start to like football all the way to the point to start knowing players, stats, colleges they went to, strengths, weaknesses, etc... because my friend Tom liked baseball. Because my friend Bob liked football.

However on my own ... I'm don't learn. I don't search to learn things. I don't get inquisitive and start trying to research something that entertains me. Today I started peeling off every one of my interests and could pin a particular person and feeling why I was interested in it.

(A 3rd friend thought this whole thought pattern might be because of getting out of a long term relationship last year. I told them while I still love the person and would go back to them in a heartbeat, any trapping of them I have zero interest in and don't miss those trappings)

I don't get interested in anything on my own. I never have. Ever. So I'm wondering if I actually have an identity that makes me go ""This is who I am..."" and actually feel a sense of self about it, because after pairing everything down that was for everyone else that made me what I am, I can't think of what makes me me.

Since I don't know what makes me me, I think it's basically affecting every single thing in my life and that is why I can't actually go forward to improving my life and situation.

Trying to even research this type of thing gives me a physical toll, like my own body is fighting it. I was looking up things on identity crises today and the psychological thoughts behind them and I kept falling asleep. My body basically literally told me ""You don't want to do this, you want to go to sleep. Sleep is fun. Sleep is good.""

Due to a similar topic and this topic my professor and other friends told me to go watch Moana (which I haven't) and I can't open Netflix because my body/brain basically rebels now.

I have something of a background now to talk to my therapist about when I can get an appointment with the little reading I did do... but I'm pretty much lost...

Oh, and one of my good friends was worried about this being a depression bout. It's not. If it was a depression bout thinking about this would have crippled me.

So talking and discussion about this topic will hopefully help me get perspective.

Your thoughts? Mostly everything I find is about Identity Crisis where as a teenager you actually start forming your identity and if you don't get an opportunity to, it may screw you up and haunt you later. I'm not sure if this is THAT but if there is another term with what I'm having I'm all eyes.",22Oct2017,3

10,"Hi all. Just as a little preface, I want to thank anyone who takes the time to read this wall of text. I did check the sidebar, but if this posts breaks any rules, I apologize.

I just want to tell my story. Put it out there to people who will listen even when they know they don’t have to. I’m not asking for help, advice, or anything like that, I just want to tell my story to people who can understand. I’ve made a throwaway for this post, but I’ve lurked this sub for awhile and feel like I’ve gotten a sense of the community, so hopefully someone wants to listen. 

Let me introduce myself. My name is imbadwithaccountname. I’m a 20 year old male currently attending university in the US. I study chemical engineering, and am about half way through my second year.

But that’s not where my story begins. It begins early in my childhood, back to some of my earliest complete memories. I was very different from my sister as a child. She was an outgoing, level headed, sweet little girl who was as happy as could be. Myself? Well, I was a sweet child. I was well behaved (so I’ve been told), but had a much different personality. I kept to myself, and found myself to be very emotional. Between irritability and mood swings, little things could set me off. I would find myself crying out of frustration trying to brush my hair in the morning (my hair was super short). 

Flash forward to high school. I have a very close group of a few friends, then pretty much separate myself from most others. I had the occasional girlfriend, but I’ll get to that soon. My friends were great. Sometimes. It was a group of all female friends, and one guy. So the high school drama was very real, and I lived it everyday, even though it was never about me. I rarely ever hung out with them, even if they were my only friends. That should’ve been a red flag to myself, but I just looked past it. I played for the school soccer team, but didn’t get along very well with most of the guys.

Now those girlfriends? Well obviously people will look back at high school, and laugh at their relationships, but I can say the same. I dated this one girl, we will call her B. I was very attracted to B, both physically and emotionally. We had similar interests and always had a good conversation going on. But, as high school relationships do, things changed. This is the part that disgusts me. I became that “overly attached” guy who wouldn’t let the relationship die. Between the never ending texts to writing handwritten letters thinking I was being romantic, I let my grip on reality slip as I tried to get B back. I lost myself in confusion and desperation.

So what does this have to do with this sub? Lame high school stories?

Well, there was a behind the scenes going on in my mind in high school, and I can now look back and see all the signs. It began with deteriorating self esteem. I slowly felt worse and worse about myself, despite being an athlete and near the top of my class. Then, began the suicidal thoughts. Nearly everyone can say they’ve had the thoughts like “well maybe the world would be better off if I wasn’t around” and while those thoughts are saddening, they’re usually not something taken seriously. But then it progressed from there. The thoughts worsened more and more until I was completely convinced I was ready to die. And obviously, that’s horrifying. 

One day, it just hit my like a brick wall. I broke down into tears, and crawled down the stairs and basically into my dad’s lap. I’m 6’2” and he is 5’10” so it’s not like that is too easy of a feat. Through the sobbing I tried to explain to him the suicidal thoughts, and that I was terrified. I was terrified of myself. I didn’t know what to do. My family has always been super supportive of me, and very loving, so I went to him. He didn’t know what to do either. I told him I needed to see a doctor.

Eventually, he calmed me down, and just explained that we would figure it out. The next morning, I found my parents in the kitchen frantically making phone calls and looking things up on their laptops. I asked them what was going on, and my dad just broke down in tears. This is a man that I was seen cry maybe once before in my life. He breaks down in tears, and starts saying he feels like he failed as a parent. I was heartbroken. I ended up skipping school that day because I just felt ill. After hours of research though, they found a few options for doctors. I was 17 at the time of this breakdown, turning 18 the next month. This wasn’t exactly an easy task since I was only a minor for about a month more. But we found a psychiatrist that took minors as new patients, but would continue seeing them once they were 18+. So we got an appointment, and went through the process. After all the questions, stories, tears, and everything else, it eventually came down to a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, severe social anxiety, and depression. 

This is when I had the biggest realization of my life, as he explained to me the red flags of all of my stories. The irritability and mood swings as a child, the few friends whom I would rarely hang out with in high school, the weirdness of relationships and everything like that. I couldn’t even go to the store without breaking down into tears first.

So now I knew what was wrong, the next step obviously is to try and fix it. With anxiety and depression, the obvious choice was to begin therapy.

Well.... that went horribly. I couldn’t form a connection of any sort with my first therapist. After about 10 sessions, she herself came to the conclusion that it wasn’t working and I might be better off with someone else. So I changed to another one.

Well.... this one was even worse. I formed a connection, but it was one of hatred. This man essentially told me everything I had done in life up to that point was entirely worthless. Thanks guy, that totally didn’t worsen everything.

So I went back to the psychiatrist, and he told me that was his fear. So a little more info about me. I love science. Science science science. It’s very obvious that my brain has grown to be very focused on facts. I’m an engineering major, so my life still is math and science. Facts.

The psychiatrist told me he was worried therapy wouldn’t work due to my strong desire for facts and solid answers. I found therapy to be way too ambiguous, which ended up causing it to be more detrimental than helpful. So, medication is was. He started me off on a low dose anti depressant, which surprisingly worked very well on the first dosage we tried. I found myself more talkative, I could go to stores, make phone calls, and less irritable. 

So obviously with these results, and based on how I like to think, it feels like all evidence points toward the illness being biology based, specifically regarding serotonin reuptake, as I was on a SSRI. 

So things went well.

Ha and then college happened. Hello big slap from reality, I’ll take that beating with a side of fries please.

College hit like a total brick wall. I only go to college 2 1/2 hours away from home, so it’s not really that far. The classes weren’t the issues. It was the social aspect and the stress of a new life. I began having extremely vivid suicidal dreams, to the point that I could wake up in the morning and remember the time on the clock in the background (it was 2:43 AM if anyone cares). These dreams turned into day dreams, then fantasizing. I thought of creative ways to off myself. And things only got worse.

During this time, I was talking to my dad through it all. My psychiatrist had left his company, so it was just me and my dad. Things got so bad, I found myself sitting in my dorm crying with a belt around my neck, ready to end it all. But I didn’t. I didn’t do it. 

So here I am now. Over a year later from when I was prepared to do it. Things aren’t perfect in life, but they’re much better than they were a year ago. I have some supportive friends who know my story. A supportive family who will drop everything and drive to me if I need them to. The stresses of school exist but I’m surviving. Through this all I was introduced to the semicolon project, and just feel inspired. Which is part of the reason I wanted to share my story. 

So for anyone who read this wall of text, thanks for taking the time out of your day. Hopefully it meant something to you, but if it didn’t, that’s cool too. If anyone has any questions about my story, I’ll be happy to answer. Why? Because it’s my story, and I get to write it.",22Oct2017,6

16,"This is my first on reddit in well over a year. Not sure where else to post this but whatever.
I believe my best friend has his lost mind.
We have been friends since 16/17 years old(now 21), we used to smoke, drink and abuse drugs nearly every week but i thought that was normal as alot of kids did that at that age. His behaviour has always been somewhat weird, he used to steal alot and get kicked out of clubs everytime we went out and he used to abuse mdma to a level where he would pass out. Again, i thought we were just kids having fun, now we are at university i dont think he can handle the freedom, he gets drunk and high everyday and starts fights, he bottled someone, he smashed someones tv, he abused a security guard and he gets drunk by himself and picks up mushrooms from the floor thinking 'it will get him high'. He has been kicked out of his flat for stealing and it is now nearly impossible to have a conversation with him, all he does is murmur or insult me. Hes never sober and when he isnt he doesnt even make sense. All my friends are telling me to ditch him but i would never do that as he is like my brother but he doesnt listen to me and i'm not sure what to do.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

17,"Hello Everyone,
My parents and I have damn near lost hope. I feel that the US does not have the institutions available to help low income people like my brother. My brother has always had trouble throughout life. Everything from frequent emotional breakdowns over very little beginning in child hood to jail time for selling drugs.

He has never been able to hold a job and usually managed to get by through my parents help and selling weed illegally. Talking to him about serious matters usually breaks down into a crying and yelling fit saying everyone is against him (He just turned 28). He was diagnosed with add then adhd then bi polar. For a long time I have thought he may have mild schizophrenia, but I am certainly not qualified nor impartial enough to make that kind of diagnosis. He does appear to recall events in ways that are invented and I think he believes them fully rather than lying. He was medicated for bi polar, but the various medications caused weight gain, drooling and an overall loss of engagement (I didn’t observe this myself, as I haven’t lived at home for almost 10 years.) He stopped taking the medication due to these reasons. He has smoked a high volume of high potency weed daily for a long time. Yesterday he admitted to being addicted to opioids to me. I also think it’s possible he is snorting something.

His current situation is that he lives in a south eastern US state with very little income and no health insurance. He lives near my parents and may be a father soon. I currently live in Europe and do not have the means to visit often.

19,"Hey guys, I need some perspective and maybe a little you're-not-alone, because I've had a bad few months. I was dating a guy for around 6 months -- I know, not a terribly long relationship but I tend to fall super hard and fast -- and when he broke up with me, I took it VERY hard. He wanted to be friends, I said no, but then missed him so badly we tried to still hang out. Went on a day trip together, continued texting, etc., all the while knowing that I still wanted to be with him and if he started dating someone, I wouldn't be able to handle it. 

Fast forward to today, over the past few months we fought so badly (usually instigated by me getting jealous, wanting more attention from him, basically wanting things to be like we were when we were dating) that he will barely speak to me. Yesterday, it came to a head when we were at the same festival and I saw him there with a female friend (who was one of the things we'd fought about) and after hearing he was perfectly nice and chatty to a friend I was with, I texted him saying not to talk to my friends if he won't text me back. To this he responded, ""lol ok"". I lost it. I sent him a barrage of abuse, and when the parade we were watching was over, found him in the crowd and demanded to talk to him. It's like something came over me, plus I'd been drinking, but I couldn't help myself. He, of course, wanted nothing to do with the conversation, told me I was crazy multiple times, and essentially ran away from me. He then blocked my number, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. 

I know I acted irrationally and drove him to this point, I just don't know how to control myself when I have these flashes of anger and jealousy and hurt. I know I have obsessive tendencies and its usually to do with people or men I'm seeing (constantly checking their social media, seeking out info on girls they may be seeing, giving myself anxiety attacks when I feel like things are going badly) I struggle with knowing people are upset with me or mad at me, so my action is to always try to ""fix"" things rather than leaving people alone. His last words to me were ""have some respect for yourself"", which is painful to hear he thinks I have no self-respect, but he's probably right.

I guess I am just wondering how to move forward from here; he clearly wants no contact with me so I know there's nothing I can do in that respect. I'm very embarrassed and ashamed of how pathetic and desperate I came off not only yesterday, but in the time that's passed since he broke up with me. He had been very patient and talked through a lot of stuff with me and argued back and forth when I'd text him things, even though he'd told me he wanted the arguments to stop and to move on with his life. It felt impossible to let it go, and now I've continued lashing out so much that I feel like he may truly hate me.

Has anyone else ever lost their mind a little in this way? It's like I can see myself doing insane things but feel powerless to stop it. Any thoughts or advice would be so appreciated. ",22Oct2017,1

21,Hey all. I take one 100 mg pill of wellbutrin every day. Is this a low dose?,22Oct2017,3
22,"She is actually my ex-girlfriend during high school but not too long after we broke up she started dating a guy who seemed like a big douche. Few months go by and she moves in with the guy and his mom. Then not too long after that they sporadically moved halfway across the country to Phoenix without telling anybody. She completely shut out everybody that she knew back home, including her family for over a year.


Earlier this year, she came back home after her boyfriend physically and emotionally abused her for months. A restraining order was filed and had to escape back when he was working one day. She seemed empty on the inside when I first talked to her again. It was really sad to see but over the next couple months she got better. She was able to get a couple jobs and was planning to take classes at a community college once the school year started up again. I was living in a different state for college at the time but she came to visit me a couple times.
Honestly, we were getting intimate again but nothing more than just a FWB type situation and it never turned into a problem. There were a few other guys she said she was seeing as well but she met them all through Tinder and none of those materialized into anything.


Something always seemed off about her ever since she came back though. Her best friend and I both voiced concerns to each other but just thought that her boyfriend scarred her so bad that she just was acting strange from that. Once her and I were at a restaurant, she started talking about how the people in the booth behind us were talking about her and she demanded we leave before we even got our meals. Another time when we were asleep, she said she woke up and heard two people talking outside and kept looking into the window and laughing. I just thought it was a weird dream she had. Her best friend said that recently for a couple weeks in the summer she wouldn't go outside and when she did, she kept saying that airplanes were following her and was obsessed with the numbers 9/11. And there was a time at Target she said that everyone was staring at her and laughing and ran out of the store crying. Her friend and I were trying to convince her that she needed to see a psychiatrist since these were strong signs of a deep mental illness like schizophrenia. She kept saying no though.


Then apparently her friend found out that she was making contact with her ex-boyfriend again. Her friend said she didn't look healthy and the last time she saw her that it looked like nothing was in her eyes and completely empty inside. Then out of the blue she left in the middle of the night. The only contact she has made with anybody was when I didn't know she was missing and texted her that I was coming home for the weekend and asked if she wanted to hang out and said replied that she would think about it.


We are thinking she is back with her boyfriend whether it be in Phoenix or back home somewhere. Her friend and family has contacted police in both cities and they filed reports but said that if she is living with her boyfriend consensually, there is almost nothing we can do because she can void the restraining order at any time. We're just scared and desperate because we know that she is very sick and needs help and the last thing she needs is her boyfriend abusing her. I'm scared she might end up very badly hurt or even dead.

And she never actually ended up going...said she called and he seemed fine. 

I was able to talk him out of it and he is back to his senses but....what the fuck? 
For days I can't stop thinking about it. I am so disgusted and confused. Am I overreacting? Maybe I just grew up with really overbearring parents... but I am just apalled. 

He also has never done this before to her knowledge, so its not like she is ""over it"" or something.",22Oct2017,1
29,"Has anyone had experience with residential treatment facilities in California for kids that are 12? My son is going to be 12 next week and he is on his third psychiatric hospitalization in 2 months. He's been diagnosed with autism, ADHD, anxiety, Oppositional Defiant Disorder and intermittent explosive disorder. Our psychiatrist is recommending a residential treatment center well they figure out his medication because he's so violent at home. I know that California treatment centers are not locked so they're recommending that we go out of state which I am not thrilled about. I'm hoping that someone here might know of a residential treatment center in California that is in a rural enough area that my son couldn't run away from it. We're working with the social worker from the hospital and the Regional Center, Googling rtc's has not been very helpful.

Thanks

30,"I don't really know where else to go. I had a support system that fell through. I no longer live where I grew up so I virtually have no friends except my husband, who also suffers from both. (Anxiety and depression..not pregnancy &gt;.&gt;) I used to take fluoxitine but decided to wean off of it after finding out I was pregnant. Now I'm 21 weeks, and a fricken mess. We're running our own business, which is primarily funded by Groupon purchases and barely making ends meat. I had a job that made decent wage but was fired. ( and that whole situation has been a literal nightmare. First time I've ever been fired from a job, and has severely hurt my self esteem, which was low to begin with, when it came to doing a dream job. Now I don't work in that industry anymore.) So much has happened this year, And honestly if it wasn't for the baby inside me I would have probably done something to myself. I just lost my medical insurance because the payment bounced and I wasn't notified. So I tried to reapply via the marketplace and they told me that because of my financial situation and am pregnant I need to apply for aid, which takes at least a month to go through. Then literally the day after Trump announced his executive order for healthcare aid. 

I live in Oregon. (fighting the urge to just roll my head across the Keyboard.)",22Oct2017,3
31,"My boyfriend and I are together for two years now, my mental health started to get bad half a year after we met. I have gotten better since and the experience actually got us closer and our relationship deeper. But I still get low sometimes, I get depressed and anxious. There are days where I stay in my bed all day, crying or staring at the ceiling feeling hopeless. We usually meet up every two or three days. The last month he barely talks to me when we are not together (not on the phone or messages) I'm scared that I'm over reacting, but the fact that we don't talk on these days makes me sad and anxious, and my the bad days get more bad and I don't know how to seek help from him. I don't want to make him feel bad or guilty when he his alone doing his things or when he doesn't talk to me much. I don't want to strangle him and that he will feel that I'm to much. I also don't know how to tell him that I feel bad and that I'm crying at the moment. 

If you have any advice about being in a relationship and having mental issues please help!

32,"Didn't know what to put in the title at all... hope it makes sense.

Basically I'm wondering if the behaviour of a certain person can be considered to be abusive. He's been ignoring me for about two years now. During that time I tried contacting him three times. Once was a response to the last thing he said to me, and probably the time he decided to cut me out. Then again half a year later to ask him for help, something only he could do and something that was important for my career, no response. then again one and a half years later with something that could be important for his job. I'm just listing these to show I haven't constantly been harassing him or something. 

I'm scared I might have been toxic for him and that that's why he decided to cut me out. 

A couple years back I also decided to cut someone out because I felt they were toxic for me. However, the difference is that when that person's father died I offered to be there and if they were to contact me I wouldn't ignore them. 

I'm wondering where people draw the line between taking care of yourself and therefore doing the healthy thing and being abusive towards another person. Any ideas? Maybe my views on this are skewed because I'm quite emotional atm.

First person I mentioned and I used to be quite close, though it was probably one-sided. Him ignoring me makes me feel like I'm not worthy of having someone who cares and that all his support was just fake...",22Oct2017,2

34,"In short, I started uni in 2014. I managed 2 terms of 1st year, then suspended studies due to depression. Went back in 2015 and managed 1 term before dropping out properly, because of depression. Started a new course at a new uni in 2016 and actually managed to complete my first year, so I'm halfway through the 1st term of 2nd year now. I'm having a pretty bad time with mental health problems at the moment (and was bad the entire summer) and I don't know what to do. I haven't been going into uni, and I'm already very behind. There's a pass/fail deadline coming up in 2 weeks and I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail it. I've maxed out on the number of years of student loan available to me, so I feel stuck now - I have to finish this course, within the 3 years. No repeating years. No suspending studies. My GP knows what is going on. My psychiatrist has been very unhelpful and has pretty much abandoned me. I'm just some other case of 'unspecified mood disorder' who has been dosed up on meds and shoved aside. I don't know what to do next. Counselling (CBT) doesn't seem to touch the issue, even though for an hour or so after a session I feel vaguely better. I've lost interest in everything. I don't understand why I wake up anymore, but my body keeps doing it. I can't tell my parents the truth because they don't ""believe"" in mental health problems (long story, I'm not going to elaborate), so no support there. I have to lie constantly. They think everything is fine, but in reality I'm very close to either dropping out of uni (and so it would really be the end of my chance to get a degree) or eliminating myself. Any advice? Anyone been in a similar position? Is it better to stay at uni and continue to not go in and probably fail the year, or to leave? And if I do leave what do I do after that? Where do I live and how do I get money if I'm bad enough that I can't even get out of bed to do something I supposedly enjoy (or at least used to)? Sorry for the long post.",22Oct2017,1

36,"i was with this guy for a little over a year, and i always knew he had bpd very early in the relationship. we both go to the same university and the same faculty. at first he was so perfect,loving and affectionate, i honestly thought i found the one. but during the relationship i would notice things i didnt like in terms of his support or emotional responses and i would bring it up to him, most times it blew up into a fight ( fault of us both) but he would not respond for day, for the longest a week. i would always have to be the one to message and reconcile or it would just drag on.  prior to our break up he he cancelled plans we made for 2 days straight and i was very upset because he had to practice for a school play. i was very upset and i saw on snapchat his friend posted that they limed after practice. i confronted him about it and it blew up to the point that be broke up with me and blocked me. i was honestly shocked at his response and begged him to talk to me via my sisters phone, but all my calls and messages went unanswered. 

the following week i saw him in school and confronted him, telling him he needs to talk to me in order for me to get my closure. he agree, but would constantly put off the dates to meet. eventually i got him to atleast call me and let us talk about it over the phone. he blamed everything on me stating he reached his limit and how he never felt loved or supported, although he knew very well that i loved him. he said his life was shit and he doesnt have the energy to put into the relationship anymore and only has energy for his school work. i begged him for a chance to work it out but he continuously said no. afterwards we hung up and i sent him a text stating the although  i may have had my flaws you also werent the best either, and that if he only communicated his problems with me then this outcome may not have occurred. after sending him that message i blocked him because i honestly just wanted to get everything off my chest and cut ties.  

i use twitter as my venting ground, and during our relationship he admitted that he never used twitter and only went on it to creep my tweets. after i blocked him i tweeted "" ive never seen someone play the victim so well""

a few hours later i see him tweeting up a storm, "" after that reaction i am content with my decision #dodgedabullet #rightdecision #emotionalabuseisreal."" he continued throwing subtweets towards me, one which hurt the most was "" when she realizes she isnt gettin her way &amp; her true colours begin to show""...in which his friend responded  with a roll eye gif. his response to their gif was "" fine! yall were right, i was just blind okay"" 

my friends saw what he was doing and got very defensive. throwing subtweets in response to his tweets. he in return targeted them saying, if you dont like my tweets unfollow me etc etc

my friend tweeted "" some men have dicks for style, and you are acting like a little bitch"" in which she tagged him

he got very angry and blocked my friends, including myself. he then called my sister and told her how my friends are tagging him in inappropriate things and that he took screenshots and would take it to the police. my sister simply responded okay and asked him about my glasses which he ordered prior to our breakup.

i am honestly very hurt my all of this cause although he attacked me in ways i never thought would have happened...i know deep in my heart i still love him....help me plz 

I am fighting the urge not to cry and breakdown when i see him in person, cause he always told me he would never leave me",22Oct2017,0

40,"The longer I stay in college, the more I learn about reality. 
The more I learn about chemistry, biology, physics, psychology, and every aspect of the field that I'm trying so hard to get into, the more I lose myself.
The more that I know that my sentience is nothing more than an evolved awareness from the same thing that makes bacteria infect, or animals eat, the more that nothing in this world seems to matter - the less I seem to matter.
The more I learn, the closer I get to my goal, but the farther away I get from my self in the process. I haven't felt truly happy, or much emotion at all, in years. I've been learning to deal with that fact, and find little things to smile about or cry about here and there - I've been getting so much better, and I'm proud of myself for it, but I don't know if I want to subsist like this forever.
Nothing matters, but I'm still only an undergrad. I still have the better part of a decade left if I want to go through the absolute minimal amount of grad school I'll need to be at my goal. 
I know I'll never be content if I can't reach it, but after all this time, and all the years I have left to go, I'm not sure if I'll even have the ability to really feel again by the time this is all over.
Old friends don't recognize me. I don't recognize me either.

This isn't a complaint, but moreso an observation.
Happiness, sadness, laughter, love, anger; all of them are, for the most part, gone and replaced solely by logic, and there's nothing I can do about it if I want to keep going. Knowing that all of these feelings I used to have were just chemicals that evolved in a pile of meat has taken away the magic that they used to gift me. 

It's not that I'm depressed, anxious, or absent; it's that my reality will never again be what it was, and that this one is inherently missing something very important. I hope that someday I can find it, and if any of the rest of you out there are feeling this way, I sincerely hope that you can too.",22Oct2017,2
