2,"I'm scum because I keep labeling myself with mental disorders I don't have. I guess I'm not attention seeking because I don't tell anyone about these disorders, I just keep it to myself. But it makes me feel better to think I have a disorder. I don't know why. Every time I read any disorder, even if it's way more extreme than I experience, I'll think I have it. 

I'm not worried about having it or preoccupied with getting therapy. I'm just scum. I used to have actual problems, but now I don't. I'm just so attached to labeling myself as troubled..",21Dec2017,2

4,"So, to start it off I'm a 15 year old freshman in the US. I was completely happy for my first 14 years in life without any issues. I was dating a wonderful girl, then that all fell apart in April. I've completely fallen apart since, I've lost grip and can't get back. Everyday I fake being happy at school, but I get really easily upset. I often get put in a sour mood by the smallest nudge, and then become really angry and toxic towards others. I go home and instantly regret everything and feel terrible. I've gotten used to this, when I get in that mindset of that down mood. I lose all of my judgment, nothing has helped. I'm not suicidal, I've never thought about committing suicide. It's just I'm stuck in this funk, and I'm losing valuable people in my life, who were trying to help me get back to the old me. What could this be? Is there any way to help it?",21Dec2017,3
5,"I recently came to the conclusion that I suffer from something that requires a psychiatrist. I had known that I needed some sort of mental health help for a while. I had a short episode one night where I just was completely incapable of feeling or displaying any emotion or empathy. Whether it was oversleeping that triggered it or what, I don't know. I couldn't laugh, smile, frown, or anything. I couldn't even force it. Usually, my emotions are pretty guarded, but I've never had an episode where I just couldn't feel at all. I just started mumbling to myself, and all I could do was try to think logically. ""Okay, you're not feeling anything right now, and that is NOT right. You need to start looking up resources NOW.""

So I went feverishly Googling psychiatrists that take medicaid, and surprise, there are none in town and I have no means to go elsewhere atm. The closest I could find was a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner who works at a local human services center. And she already treats my mom and anyone else in town that sees a shrink. And none of them show any sign of improvement. At all.

Are there any resources, online or otherwise, that someone in my situation can use?",21Dec2017,8
6,"I have extreme issues making personal relationships which leads to me feeling isolated which causes depression. I never feel comfortable sharing things I enjoy with people, which means I generally just stay quiet in social situations since I have nothing to add. Sometimes I think I'm just not interested in people, but I think that's just an easy excuse for myself to give.

Another issue is I try to find a romantic partner and then just STOP trying to get any other friends. I don't know why this is, and it usually leads to me piling all of my problems on the other person. Which is a fun little trick my dad likes to do, I WAS finally able to admit to myself that I'm a lot like him tonight which I need to change as well.

I try to avoid making excuses for myself but it's not always possible, apologies if there are any in this post.

Any help is appreciated!",21Dec2017,4
7,So in highschool I had a mental breakdown from being bullied and I’ve always had a dream of being an actor even if I don’t make it and maybe get out in 3 major films atleast I did something with my life but you know since my breakdown I now can’t even go to any classes I went to a studio once but didn’t like it and I want to search for others schools but I can’t because of the shitty feelings I acquired since my breakdown well ever since I watched this movie one day now I can’t go to any studio cause the movie made the feelings worst. Idk if this is undiagnosed disorder I have from my breakdown but I just wish the horrible feeling I get would dissapear. I really want to do acting. I guess what I’m feeling is like some weird form of anxiety but it doesn’t feel like anxiety,21Dec2017,5

11,"I, like many of you here, have multiple diagnoses: Autism, ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, Dyscalculia. This makes my life very difficult, particularly as I have a very limited support network. My next career goal is to work abroad teaching English, but I'm concerned that I may have an 'episode' which could lead me to be suspended or fired. I'm here to ask for help and advice.


The 'episodes' as I call them, are bouts of extreme depression, frustration, lack of focus, irritability, short temper, negative mood, semi-suicidal thoughts (and to clarify, this is thinking about the action of taking my life, not going through with it; however, It's still very disturbing and stressful). This can last a few hours to a few days. Of course, working in a classroom environment in a foreign country with no friends... it makes me very nervous. It's been a goal of mine ever since I started high school.


I trialed Strattera (Atomoxetine) for a while, to no effect. Medication is off the table for the moment. For those of you with experience of this, how would you go about helping this? What can I do to either get rid of or get over these feelings?


I'm open to trying anything.


I've got three years in which to sort myself out. After that, I'm determined to go abroad whatever my situation.


I appreciate all the help you can offer!

14,"There's a girl I know.  For some reason, I feel like if I don't reply to her immediately when she contacts me, something bad will happen.  It's more of a fear or abandonment.  I need to get over this.  I'm going to try some CBT...well from what I understand CBT is... let's just call it getting over the anxiety by not replying immediately, and calming myself. She's not going to hate me and leave if I don't reply immediately right? ...am I doing the right thing here? I also don't like facebook messaging, so last time she messaged me, I just wrote her an email.  I'm going to do the same again.  That's okay, right?

The really annoying thing about facebook messenger is it tells the person when you've read the message.  So she's going to know I saw it...and well, back to were I began... a fear of her hating me if I don't reply immediately.  I hate this. I really want a platonic relationship with her, but this stupid anxiety that's supposed to be pleasurable and cute is really pissing me off.

15,"So I have a really minor-major on set delirium that I can't really ""fix"" I'm pretty much normal except I have really bad episodes when I have headaches and other bodily issues. 

However the issue is I can no longer keep a job because I get random urges to commit bodily actions that aren't really voluntary but happen. 

How am I supposed to find a job if I can't think coherently a lot of the time and I can't really work with other people anymore I get really bad thoughts like harmful, horrible thoughts that I only feel guilty about after it's long done and over with.

Because of my situation I'm homeless from couch to couch and my parents still claim me on taxes so I have never gotten a tax return myself.

This all started happening this year I started questioning my sanity and many other things that ik deep down are true but I always feel like I'm asleep or in a state of euphoria I'm afraid to drive anymore because I blackout and get bad muscle movements that I can't control like the urge to bang my head against objects during headaches and fevers (I never do it but I have this urge way too often)

I can't afford a doctor so idk what to do... I'd ask about disability but my parents would be so upset with me I'd probably commit suicide because again my thought process is really odd I can't describe it it's just how I react to things... 

Also if you can t tell it's hard for me to contain coherent sentences convos, tend to be random and never on topic or way too 1 topic focused. 


I have no idea what to do because I can't afford a doctor and thanks to my parents I can't get Medicaid because according to the government I make 75,000$ a year like my parents. 

However I am getting yelled at by everyone I sleep on their couch that I need to get a job but I seriously don't think I can... my last work environment I literally almost went on a mass murder rampage... i hate to say it but I can't help it I usually get more self harm thoughts than hostile ones and I've only ever acted on suicide never homicide or anything. But I had an abusive boss that would throw the burgers at you and tell you to ""hurry the duck up you worthless piece of crap"" I cry when I'm told no or enter any form of official looking office, it was horrible hearing names like worthless and useless it just made me question my sanity further and now I feel like I'm fucked... 


I'm afraid for myself as well as others because the only time I'm content is when I'm by myself, but I hate human contact because no one likes the things I do, at least not everything, and I do have a fiance but she just thinks I need help but no one cares to help me do anything unless it involves a job...

I'm t9rn between releasing my rights and going to a mental hospital for life and be drugged by the government as a guineapig  or if I should just commit suicide this is almost month 6 of these thoughts and feelings and idk where to turn or go... I'm basically broke homeless half insane and ready to sleep forever... What should I do... because idk myself I've never imagined myself in a position like this but I couldn't stop over thinking and it lead me here...  where I'm actually forced to ask for help outside of people I know irl because I don't know anyone who knows how to help v-v

16,"After recent and devastating events, this needs to be talked about. It is a known fact that Korea's suicide rate is one of the highest in the world. Why do you think that is? Think about it... Their constant ""need"" to be perfect and seem perfect. Need? is it a need? No it isn't a need because for them, it is the only option. One single mistake can cost you everything. Not only could you lose your job or ""fans"" if you are in the entertainment industry, but you are persecuted and bullied because you are not perfect. Honor and image are everything, you do something wrong, it affects your whole family and not just you. Even the thought of someone having depression or any kind of mental illness is looked down upon. I am focusing on the entertainment industry because of what has happened. These people work so hard to make everyone happy, and those people are always the loneliest. Their smiles are for you, not for themselves. I imagine that is how it was for Jonghyun... We are all human, we are all the same. They hurt just like we do. They do not belong to the fans and are completely entitled to live their life however they want. Just because someone wants to get married fans petition to get them removed from a group? Does that make sense?!?! They do not belong to you. Singing and dancing and acting is a job. It is a job, not a contract to sign their souls away. Having a mental illness is a normal thing and nobody is alone in this. If you have had a bad experience with a doctor it is not because they were not good enough. You guys were not a good match. For me it took years to find a good doctor that I could open up to. This has to change. They needed to be treated like humans, and mental health has to be a priority. Needing help is not a bad thing. We cannot get through life alone. Being on medication is not a bad thing! Depression and other mental illnesses can be caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. It is just as much a physical thing as a mental thing. It is not something someone chooses to have and it is not something that will just go away with time. You need to get the help. Sometimes there is no reason to be sad. Sometimes you just are and that needs to be understood. This needs to be talked about and this needs to change. This image of perfection that so many of these artists are trying to emulate is not for them it is for other people. Humans are not perfect and we never will be. Fans need to realize these guys are only humans. Imagine if you could only live how others told you to, you could not find love or be your true self. Your life depends on making no mistakes. What kind of life is that. If you truly care for ""your artists"" you will realize and accept that they are not yours. Not only do the younger generations need to know it is okay to not be perfect, but the older generations as well need to not focus so much on image and drilling it into your children's mind that perfection is the only option. I am not saying this only happens in South Korea but that is the place I am currently talking about. This needs to be spread. Having a mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of. Mental health comes first. To solve this suicide issue it needs to be the number one priority. Mental Health over everything else. Spread it.",21Dec2017,1
17,"I am going to divide this into two parts. I'll write the second part later on. The first part will be about my social life and therapy, the second part about my teeth.

I have no close relationships with anyone, and I haven't had one in roughly ten years. I'm in my early twenties and I'm still waiting to experience the joy of having a romantic relationship with someone. I'm currently in therapy. Apparently I have both Aspergers and social phobia. 

Now with all of that out of the way, let me start with the real post:

There are very few people I feel comfortable around. My psychologist is one of the few people in the world I feel I can talk to and be comfortable around, but she is the only one I can truly talk to. Recently, I learned that we are only going to have a few more sessions together, because she feels she can't help me and that I need group therapy specifically for people with Aspergers. The problem I'm having is that I'm rarely ever comfortable with other people, and there is no way I'll be comfortable in a group setting. Basically, what I'm saying is that there is no way I'll agree to group therapy and I will therefore just end my days of therapy. I tried seeing to therapists for OCD once, but there is no way I'll agree to something like that again. For aspergers, however, we're not talking about two therapists, we're talking about a group of other people with aspergers sharing their experiences. I feel very strongly about this and I wouldn't even have agreed to something like this had I been suicidal (I sincerely doubt that they'd suggest something like this for someone suicidal. My point is just that no matter how bad things are, I won't do it). It just won't work and I can't get myself to do it. 

This all leaves me with this feeling of hopelessness... This realization that I will probably always be alone because therapy is not an option for me. I felt this way beforehand, but I still knew there was a glimmer of hope that my psychologist would be able to help me change things. This is no longer the case. I feel like I'm left on my own and I already know for a fact that this isn't something I can do by myself. I also know now that therapy is not an option for me. I need to see one person, and one person alone. I don't do groups. You can call me lazy or any other adjectives you may want to use, but this is how I feel and it won't change. I also feel as if it's pointless to seek help the next time I feel terrible (because it will happen. I won't be able to fix this on my own, and therapy is no longer an option) because I know I'll only get a few sessions with one person before I get handed off to a group of people, which I, of course, will not agree to. Therefore I must ask myself... Why bother to seek help? I won't get it anyway. 

This is a terrible feeling and my future seems grim. Who will I turn to the next time things are difficult?",21Dec2017,5
18,"Over the years, my mom has been seeking constant validation from me and my brother for the image of being a good mom. She always uses her past as a way to justify this, due in part to the fact that she did have a crappy childhood.

However, my grandmother has been diagnosed with breast cancer, and, my grandmother has been toxic in many ways. Before being diagnosed with this, she would always put my mom down and sent illegiable messages, relating to how shitty my mom is, usually using explicit language.

My grandma is still kinda irate towards my mom, with the highlight being that my grandmother calked her a f*cking bitch, among other verbal explitives. My mom said she is unaffected by these insults because she is used to them, and tries to be the better person. Hell, she even went back to smoking because of my grandmother. 

In other words, my grandma becomes the example, or the catalyst, to justify the better person persona that my mom wants to be, exclaiming that we should be lucky to have a mom like her. Even before grandma, she still felt obligated to find validation, even after we gave it to her. Even today, when i did an errand for a friend, it seemed that she tried to acknowledge it towards how i was raised

She is a great mom, but seeing her try to put on the better person persona is generating mixed feelings for how i feel about her. Why does she seek so much valudation when she has it? Why does she always ask if she is a good mom, when i know she can be? Why does she try to be a better person by helping someone who is mentally abusing her? I dont know what to think anymore.

So this past week on my walks, I've noticed helicopters following me as I walk, oftentimes two but tonight there was only one. They always go wherever I go and they don't seem to want to communicate with me for whatever reason. 

Tonight I got pissed off and flipped the one helicopter the bird and it just flew off. I wish they would at least try to communicate with me, because I guess nobody ever taught them that following people around randomly isn't very socially acceptable.

22,"I've been diagnosed bipolar, but I also think I have OCD. 

Medications: lamictal, vraylar, keppra

I've been on ssris (diagnosed mdd) and they didn't help my mood swings. I then went on latuda and trentillex at the same time, they made me nauseated so I didn't take them. 

So I've never ever told anyone this and I don't want to tell my psychiatrist, but I obsess over religion and sinning through thoughts. I repetitively pray for forgiveness of these thoughts which are about Jesus. 

For all you atheists out there, I can't help it. Even when I didn't really believe for a couple years I would still get these thoughts, sometimes very terrifying and disturbing. Don't really know what to do.

Anyway, I've just been bumped up to 100mg lamictal, I'm going up to 3mg vraylar in a week or so, but I haven't felt much better, and the thoughts still haunt me. It's hard to go into detail about them because it makes me severely uncomfortable and anxious. I'll just say I get really paranoid. I'm pretty embarrassed about this.

Like I said before, I'd like to not tell my psychiatrist about this, or at least hold off on it because I've only seen him twice. I don't want to keep adding these things on. I'd like to keep the diagnoses to a minimum, especially since it isn't all that dangerous.

Down to it, then: I'd like to know how people handle OCD without medication. Will the meds I'm on help OCD?",21Dec2017,1

24,"I was asking on r/answers if someone could make me comfortable about this issue knowing that I'll never have a concrete answer. One person said I could be having early signs of psychosis. He said this:
Please talk to a therapist about this. I'm no doctor, but especially if you're 16-25, it sounds like you're describing the kind of delusional symptoms preceding a psychotic break: Odd beliefs or magical thinking (e.g., Feeling confused about whether a dream actually happened; Wondering whether other people might be able to read your mind; Finding meaningful connections between unrelated events; Clear and frequent déjà vu experiences or experiences of unreality) http://www.cedarclinic.org/index.php/understanding-early-psychosis/early-signs-of-psychosis
The Finding meaningful connections between unrelated events part sounds like me. I'm not in the age range he mentioned though.

That's when I was CONSTANTLY thinking about it. It started getting less constant over time though.

The people I worked with were being unfairly judged on their ages by the housing industry. I thought the law said age discrimination was against the law starting at 40. How is that a legal industry?

That right there is helplessness to some.

So of course they aren't going to look for more work.

A simple d2 Gene mutation can cause issues with executive functioning in the human brain and makes it very hard to overcome instant gratification.

And you know, some people are shown how good it all is on TV, so they feel the need to spend the money.

It's a huge scam. I wish I could get the two decades of TV' influence out of my mind. It is seriously an ugly creature in my head. In the heads of others.

Sure being smart helps spot it, but by the time you actually realize it, it seems kind of late. You know, because they target kids.

The iPad gen is no different and we let the executives tell us it is. Blaming the technology, not the people running it.

It is entirely wrong to entirely blame a person on their situation when there is so much influence by our ""leaders"".

They use this type of thinking to pit us against each other, and it worked too well.

People need help getting their basic needs met sometimes. Food, shelter, water, and emotional support.

People forget the emotional support part, and a lot of people get mental illness. The mental health system labels those guys crazy and uses addictive pills to cover it up. First line of defense in the US system at least.

No different than those using other drugs to try and escape the crazy. I wish people would realize that. Instead the government restarted another drug war, because the weed industry was taking too much money from pharmaceutical companies. Away from the population reducing affects of their opiates. All because we let them tell us drugs were bad. The ones they kept pushing were supposed to be good.

How has that worked?

Please spread the word. I'm really saddened by the state of our country and feel that only the truth can set us back towards the ""American dream"".

I hear Europe is beating us when it comes to that.

A year of paid leave for both parents? That's only logical since babies need a lot of emotional support.

However she has a traumatic past, and sometimes she completely zones out like she isn't there, cries and shakes uncontrollably and I believe she is actually having flash backs at times because she randomly  flinches throughout these episodes. She usually does this when something I do reminds her of something in her past, (even the smallest relation). The only way to get her to snap out of it is to keep talking to her and remind her of where she is who i am etc, although she has no actual memory loss. The first ""episode"" only happens every few months,  but once she has one she has them all the time for a while.

38,"I have a severe problem with being by myself on apartments, houses and even hotel rooms. Whenever I am alone at night I start to get stressed and feel somebody will kill me. Whenever I am living by myself I get intense feelings someone will enter the apartment/hotel room/house to rob me and murder me. 

Someone has had similar feelings? How did you manage them? Is there a medicine for this? Thank you",21Dec2017,7

42,"I am an informal patient at a hospital in the UK. I've recently had 12 days leave and want to discharge myself. Despite my history, will they still be able to section me under the mental health act because if I was able to keep myself safe for 12 days then surely they don't hAve enough evidence to suggest I am still a danger to myself? Unless they use my history I'm sure they cannot section me because they dont hAve enough evidence to prove I am at risk. The reason I'm asking is because i was threatened by my psychiatrist to section me if i try to discharge myself. My history consists of a suicide attempt 1 month ago.

43,I was diagnosed with severe OCD a year ago and have recently started my first relationship since the diagnosis. I’ve found that managing my anxiety and OCD is significantly more difficult in a relationship than outside of one. The majority of my episodes and irrational thoughts stem from trusting my partner and the strength of “us”. Any advice on how to move on from my OCD and anxiety issues and begin enjoying my relationship? ,21Dec2017,2
44,"I don't know what to do. I need a place to vent I guess. I broke up with my ex girlfriend about May time and later met my current friend through work, it was a new job as well. We were in the same boat and not long out of relationships but something in us just clicked after hanging out a few times. Within a few months, we were dating and sleeping together. After we slept together a few times something in her clicked and shes not been the same since. She wont move on from her ex. Shes mega depressed and anxious and I can't even have conversations with her because she either stays quiet or goes back to talking about the ex boyfriend. She's literally used me as an emotional punchbag in the past (apologised for it now) but its like she's got nothing to talk about unless its to do with the ex or her mental health.

We were friends before we were dating and I try and do everything I can to help her but how do you help someone that wont help them self. She goes to therapy and the doctors constantly but its not helping any. Ive suffered from depression for almost 10 years but im only now at a stage where the bad days aren't everyday. She's draining me and I can't avoid her because we work and carpool together and hang out sometimes. She's very irritating at work and pesters me while im busy no matter how many times I ask her to knock it off, IM the one that seems irritating. ",21Dec2017,1
45,I sometimes have this very terrible feeling that gets released by the randomest things. I can only know it when I feel it( it lasts from 5-10 seconds). It is almost like I get an awful feeling that I am an imposter. It makes no sense. I cant control this feeling. It causes me a lot of stress when I feel it. It is like it just flew into my head too( it isnt something I can feel voluntarily),21Dec2017,1

47,"*Trigger warning: this post will contain description of self-harm and suicidal thoughts*

Hi everyone,

I am wondering if anyone can offer me advice or potentially sympathize with me if you have ever gone through a similar situation.

For the past few years I have been living in a state of near-constant panic. The main component of my anxiety has been centered around health anxiety. I have been to my GP many times about various heart problems I thought I had, and was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). As of now I have not received any medication or therapy for it. I have not talked to my GP about any of my other mental health issues and so far GAD is my only diagnosis. 

About a year and a half ago I made a serious mistake. After coming home from a party (I was drunk) and having a fight with my boyfriend, I started panicking that he didn’t care about me, so I started threatening that I would hurt myself. I remember feeling extremely emotional, feeling panicked that my boyfriend didn’t care about me, and having the intention of making a small cut on my wrist as a way for me to “prove” the pain I was feeling. I did not want to kill myself. The knife, however, was very sharp and being drunk I made a deep gash in my wrist. I freaked out and thought I was dying, and long story short, we called an ambulance, I claimed it was an accident, I got stitched up and was physically fine. There were a couple of other times that I made threats of self-harm but I never really meant it other than the one incident described above. I am prone to self-diagnosing myself with health conditions, but I now suspect that I have borderline personality disorder (BPD), or at least traits of it, due to threatening self-harm as a manipulation tactic.

 I have vowed to never threaten self-harm again because I realized afterward that I was using it as a manipulation tactic and it was not fair to my boyfriend. I have not made any threats in a long time after doing a lot of work to understand my own mind. I made those threats as a desperate attempt to get attention while I was emotional and insecure about myself. I regret making those threats more than anything else in my life. I still have panic attacks and sometimes lose my temper, and my anxiety will escalate during insignificant arguments, but I have developed better ways of dealing with it and my boyfriend has been really supporting me through it. I was doing much better for a while.

Right now I am currently dealing with intense anxiety that I have BPD and will never get better. That I will kill myself eventually, since BPD has high suicide rates. I am having what I think are intrusive thoughts about suicide. I do NOT want to kill myself! But thoughts keep running through my head such as “imagine how easy it would be to take a knife and slit your throat”, “look at those knives over there, what if you just picked one up and killed yourself”, “what if you lose control and commit suicide”. I know other people deal with these intrusive thoughts about harm, but I am extremely scared that I will act on them. Every time I walk by a knife I get what feels like an urge to pick it up and a movie will flash in my head of slitting my throat. I hate these thoughts and want them to go away. But given my history, and the one time I really did hurt myself with a knife (and pretty badly too), I am so terrified I will lose control of myself and actually do it. It feels exactly like the health anxiety I am used to experiencing but this time I am scared of my own mind. I went into full on panic attack earlier today because I read that most suicides are done on impulses. Are these intrusive thoughts or am I really suicidal?

I feel like I am losing my mind. I don’t trust myself. I have accepted that I need professional help and will be seeing a doctor tomorrow morning and I am hoping he can refer me to a psychiatrist. But even then, it’s not like I can try medication can I? I read that most antidepressants for anxiety can cause suicidal thoughts – which seems like it would be counterintuitive to solving my problem. I feel like there is no way I can get better, despite DESPERATELY wanting to, and I feel like I am doomed to live like this forever.

Is there any hope for me? Am I a bad person and a lost cause?",21Dec2017,3
48,"So, the title kind of explains it. She was diagnosed about 6 months ago. The symptoms she mostly focuses on are quick irritability and promiscuous behaviors. When she is having a bad day, I try my best to be there for her and give her advice that's not too harsh. What I've noticed lately, and I'm not sure how long it's been going on, is that she constantly finds something to be upset over and she is constantly cheating on her husband and using the symptom mentioned above as an excuse. She's quick to invalidate anyone else who is having a ""bad day"" and instantly turns it around to talk about her problem. Is there any way I can get her to realize she is becoming a toxic person without absolutely crushing her or should I try for the blunt and honest approach? ",21Dec2017,13
49,"It got a lot better. I went through 10+ medications, and last time I was taking 5 different medications at once. I had a lot of difficulty from (and I never even told a psychiatrist this) sexual abuse while I was way too young to even know what sex was. 

It affected my relationships, my physical health, my quality of life. I have long accepted the far reaching effects of these illnesses.

 But I don't think that was the hardest part. I think the hardest part is that, now that I'm much more stable and off my meds (I just finished a master's degree in computer science) now that I have a financially viable career and whatnot, I am forgetting what I pushed through to get to this point...

I came from a country plagued by poverty and illiteracy where these mental illnesses are very very common, but nobody recognizes them to be actual disabilities. Mental illness is the norm for many of us. Even though I am now living in California and my close friends are from America, I still feel that my struggles are nothing compared to the intense grief and difficulty that my people have experienced.

In reality I dread to get out of bed every morning, I just want to lie down and cannot get up. It takes an immense amount of effort or a dose of medication to get out of bed so I can have a little caffeine to go forward in the morning. I fear that I will live my life with these ghosts. Many days in graduate school I cried on my own with the weight of this burden. When I worked a job I had weekends where I would not leave the house. I would not be able to leave the house for several days. 

But the reality is, I am able to go forward like this. I cannot kill myself because that is unfair to those whom I love. Otherwise, that would be an easy way out. Is it going to be like this forever? I don't want to roll the dice every morning for suicidal thoughts. They happen randomly every week or few weeks.

What is the point of life if it shall be like this? It is difficult to love and be loved, difficult to form and maintain relationships, and I feel that I need to put in thrice as much effort for simple tasks (like driving) as others.

 Even if someone just reached out right now, I would feel better. Maybe there is someone on this subreddit who understands what I am going through",21Dec2017,1

52,"This is not some stupid cry for help. Just wondering if anyone else has legit felt like their dental problems were making them go fucking crazy. 

So all my teeth are fucked. 

Made a dumb ass decision in my younger years and shoplifted which made me a felon. Yea, I know. Serves me right but at the time I thought stealing clothes for my kids was the best option I had... turns out i was a fucking moron. Now, I can’t land a job. I still have kids, obviously can’t afford dental or health care &amp; damn sure not a plane ticket anywhere. Asking for help from anyone I know is just going to get me laughed at bc around here everyone has the mentality of “serves your dumb ass right, you shouldn’t have stolen” (And They’re are right) It’s not enough that I’m labeled a felon for the rest of time. Loans don’t happen for people without a job or bad credit. People don’t want to help a felon. 

It’s not enough that the hopelessness and despair I feel in the depths of my soul are insurmountable, I also look in the mirror and see horror on the outside. 

You know those moments when something happens and you momentarily forget about all your worries &amp; problems? Well, I can’t even smile then. When I do... everyone’s eyes IMMEDIATELY dart to my broken smile... the one that can’t even pretend anymore... before, my smile could hide my brokenness... but now, everyone knows &amp; the whole world laughs. 

My children are older now. My oldest is in middle school. She used to like for me come to her class fied trips and school lunches but now she doesn’t. If she does ask me to come, she follows up asking me to come by asking me not talk or to make me promise not to smile... “or maybe” she asks “Auntie can pretend to be my mom, we kind of look alike. At least we both have our teeth”....

So yea, sadness is an understatement &amp; suicide is a huge reality when everything about your life has been a failure. It’s not really bc of my teeth. I guess my teeth are just the most outward thing. I feel like I work on the internal stuff with the therapist every week. I can lose or gain weight, dye my hair or put makeup on but I can’t do a damn thing about my teeth and it legitimately affects everything &amp; every relationship I have. Maybe &amp; probably it affects my relationship with myself the most. It truly does hurt (maybe the most) that my kids are embarrassed by me. I mean, I broke my first tooth FLOSSING.... I have no idea why they even keep breaking what I do know, is that I’m actually in tears typing this. 

Anyway, not going to jump off a bridge or anything... just really stuck inside my head right now. No one to talk to. I honestly wish I had a magic wand. I wish I raised my kids to not be embarrassed by this. I wish I could fix my teeth for my kids... so they don’t have to be ashamed of me. But the moment I even start to think that or say that, people assume that is a cop out. 

Am I crazy? ",21Dec2017,36
