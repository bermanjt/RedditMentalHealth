0,"Hi I'm 16 and just started a job in an arcade when I have to constantly be tidying up PSVR headsets, put people into oculus rift booth sections and help people as well as looking around, I love the job, but as I fall asleep I keep getting this inside voice ((As in the one that says ""Oh shit I'm not doing this"" kind of voice)), which is telling me to continue working, to, for example, check the VR, which puts me at a slight state of unease as I obviously know that I'm in bed and out of work, but as I fade from conscious to unconscious the thought of needing to check the VR comes in in a mildly urgent sort of fashion. Is this just my brain adapting to work? Or is this a sign of something else?",13Nov2017,3
1,"I would never get involved with my best friends girlfriend, and ive never tried getting with one of my friends exes, even after them coming on to me.

Its been over 2 years since he passed, so its not like we had any intention of this happening back then, but trying to justify this to myself makes me question if im just delusional.

2,"Therapist in context is LCSW, not a phd.

I opened up to my therapist about my alcohol issues. I drink to cope, I drink in particular to handle crowded loud social situations.

I drink *way too fucking much* to deal with said social situations. We're talking 10 drinks in an hour too much.

I also have a family history of alcoholism. My father is an abusive drunk, full stop. And she knows that.

... her recommendation was Xanax. 

And she was almost angry when asked why, pointing to its regular abuse and how its withdrawals can be potentially fatal [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome), [american addiction center](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/xanax/) [note: seizures can kill you.]

She told me ""it would probably be less addictive for you"" ... i am also a relatively heavy (tobacco) smoker, and again she knows this. 

I am not taking her advice and have canceled any future sessions since there were other issues (largely her not taking anything I'm concerned about seriously) , but... This seems wildly inappropriate? Am I paranoid?",13Nov2017,1

4,There were some comments on sadcringe discussing when/how to let your SO know you are dealing with mental illness and it got me thinking. I don’t really date so I’ve never actually thought about it but I know when/if I do it’ll be something I have to face. Is it better to disclose it sooner rather than later? Do you tell them at all? How do you tell someone something like that? What do you think? When would you like to be told?,13Nov2017,2

6,"Tl;dr: Geodon gave me an incurable, practically untreatable bladder disease called interestial cystitis. I'm in constant, agonizing pain in my crotch. I can't have sex anymore or eat most foods without making the pain worse. If you're considering this drug, please don't risk it. Please. It's made my life a living hell. Your doctor will say I'm lying or that it's a coincidence. Read more if you're considering this drug.

Late last year, my doctor prescribed Geodon to treat a bipolar mixed state. I had never taken an antipsychotic before, so I was nervous about it. I posted in a mental health Facebook group that I was in and asked if anybody had any experience with it. One person said it gave her interstitial cystitis. I had never heard of this. I looked it up and it sounded awful but I couldn't find any association with Geodon. I asked my doctor and she said it was impossible, too.  I trusted my doctor. I took the drug and thought nothing of it. I thought it was perfectly safe. It was the biggest mistake of my life. 

I was on 20 mg of Geodon for about a month and it helped a little but I was still having mood swings so we raised the dose to 40mg. About one week after being on the 40mg dose it I felt like I was getting a UTI. I had completely forgotten about the warning that the stranger on FB gave me at this point. My urine test was negative for UTI but they sent it off for culture and sent me home with antibiotics. Three days later, they called and said the urine culture was negative and to follow up with a urologist. I Googled ""UTI symptoms no infection"" and saw the words ""interstitial cystitis"" and the memory of the Facebook  warning came flooding back. I couldn't believe it. She was right. My doctor was wrong. There is no warning from the manufacturer and no information on a link anywhere. How could this happen?!

Of course, I went to a urologist (several, actually) and interstitial cystitis was diagnosed. This was in January of this year. I haven't been able to find ANY relief whatsoever. I've tried everything the doctors suggest and nothing helps. Some people with this disease find treatment that works, but not me. I can't help but feel like Geodon did something that makes it particularly untreatable. The pain only gets worse. I'm in CONSTANT pain. If you've ever had a UTI, you know what the pain feels like. I have to stick to an incredibly limited diet or else the pain gets to be so bad that my vision gets blurry. Sex also makes the pain worse. 

I've lost everything. I had to move back in with my parents. I had to leave school. I can't sleep anymore. Even with medication, I'm lucky to get 90 minutes of sleep at a time. I don't feel like a human being anymore. Every night when I'm trying to sleep I hope I don't wake up. 

I know this sounds crazy. People say crazy shit on the internet all the time. Logic and reason says to trust doctors and research. Well, that's what I did. My life is ruined because of it. I've never had bladder problems in the past, either.   It must be an incredibly rare side effect and it probably won't happen to you, but please don't even risk it. There are plenty of other drugs to try. I wish I could go back in time and slap the pills out of my hands. But alas, I'm just sitting here crying my eyes out because I know I'll never get my life back. I wish I could sue. ",13Nov2017,1

9,"I work as an accountant in a government organisation. Since I’m dealing with figures, I’m always very anxious when the output of my work are being discussed at management level, fearing that the numbers will be scrutinised and if a question is asked, I’m unable to answer.

When I was young, I was shy and introverted, preferring to avoid sports and any roles attracting attention.

This leads to a point when I’m constantly on edge in the office, and I’m tempted to call in sick to escape it all. My workplace is rather fast paced and I’m not keen to go to a slower pace environment as I’m only 29 years old.

Whenever people show me their newborn I always feel pity for the baby, innocent, never seen real shit yet, and most of all vulnerable. I always have an urge to put it out of its misery but I never carried it out not because of the consequences but because I don't want to actually hurt the baby. The same thing goes with cute animals too. When ever I see a ""cute"" puppy photo I just see a weak and fragile thing that couldn't possibly survive once it has to survive by itself.

I’m 17 and my mental conditions have been either getting worse or harder to manage. I’ve been getting help all my life but it seems these few months have just been thorns in my sides. 
I experience states of depression where I’ll just not want to do anything, but nothing like this before. 
Earlier today I experienced, out of nowhere and nothing triggering it, my body losing all will to make any sort of movement. 
I was just doing craft projects and listening to music when I felt like I was slowly being dragged away from my own body. It was as if I forgot how to function just all at once.
 I just sat there, for almost an hour, trying my hardest to get the will to move. I started to cry, I’m not sure why, but after a bit darker thoughts begin to cloud my mind. 
This has happened maybe in short iterations in the past but this is the first time it’s gone on for this long. 
I would only be able to move if something angered me, like if I didn’t like the way my hand was positioned, or the sound of my dog eating was too loud, only then would my body be motivated to move in some way. I wasn’t able to stand until my dog crawled over and seemed to help me get out of my immobile state somewhat. I was still clouded with dark thoughts and sudden destructive urges that made me start to cry even more, but eventually I snapped out of it after getting a bite of a cookie and moved on like it never even happened.

14,"I went through the first 16 years of my life without ANY depression or extreme sadness. I had my life planned out and was following that plan. Everything changed when I was rejected by the person I loved. 

I'm 23 and to this days I genuinely believe that I truly loved this person. To keep it short, I had cultivated a love for this person over a year or so and was hoping to spend my life with them. 

When they rejected me, yeah I was heartbroken but the pain subsided, so I thought. From that time onward, I've had sometimes debilitating depression, anger, and suicidal thoughts. It all goes back to that moment though. That's where it all started.

18,"Hey Everyone,

I'll try to be brief and not too personal. Basically a while ago I lost my job that I was at for 13 years (since I was 18) and it caused me a lot of trauma. It's been about two years since then and I still haven't recovered. I ended up losing my girlfriend, all of my savings and couldn't find another career. It left me with a lot of depression, and nightmares (I haven't had 8 hours of sleep since then).

I've been to two different therapist over that course of time, and both times I found that they couldn't really handle what I've been through. It seemed like they were just used to couples arguing or minor scuffs, and nothing like this. So my question is, how exactly do I find someone that can fit this so I can get the help I need? Do I need a psychiatrist instead? I went to the first therapist three times, and the second 8. 

Thanks for any tips I appreciate it",13Nov2017,3
19,"I am messed up emotionally and I don't know where to begin.

Today at work I almost cried. I have these moments when I think about my past. A mix of nostalgia and things that I could have done better or changed. These usually come after suicidal thoughts.

My family. I love my family and they love and support me. I grew up in a normal household and had a pretty good life as a kid. My parents worked and supported us and gave me a lot when I look back at it. They were there for mw in my dark and tough momentum, bought me stuff, drove me everywhere etx.. As a teenager I started to get attitude and I treated them like garbage sometimes. I'd yell at them and become incredibly selfish and impatient sometimes. I'd never help around the house and other things. This still continues somewhat to this day. I'm 25. Our relationship is mostly good but thinking back to these moments and how much my parents have done and would react if I took my life destroys me emotionally.

Same with my brothers. I am the oldest. I had a fun childhood with my brothers but I sometimes bullied them and made them cry and did really mean things. Despite this we mostly got along and played. As we're older we don't really talk much and we aren't as close as we were as kids, although we still do care for each other. I asked them recently if I did anything as a kid that hurt them. They said no and looked at me like an idiot so maybe they weren't that affected.. I know that I could have treated them better and maybe we'd have a better relationship if that happened.

Lastly my girlfriend. She is wonderful, loving and supportive. She has a really good heart. She loves me and is attached to me. I also love her. I feel like a failure in life as I'm way behind my peers and I feel like I'm letting her down. Despite this, she says that she doesn't care and loves me anyways. Recently she told me that growing up she had next to no friends and only has one friend now. Her family is kind of distant from each other and growing up they struggled and still do financially. My girlfriend would get shunned as a kid in school by peers and spent time in the washroom at recess. Her mother and sister are also pretty hard on her and don't help her confidence and self esteem. It makes sense why she's so attracted to me. I am the one thing she's ever wanted, a best friend and loving boyfriend. I feel so bad about her past and feel bad that I am not as attached as she is to me. Sometimes she's annoyingly clingy but it is for a reason and I can't blame her.

I also regret other things as well. I did many stupid, impulsive things in my youth and teenage years. Socially, financially, with education etc. I think back to how I could have acted and what I should have changed. I have wasted so much time from 18 years old doing nothing with my life. I'm in 2nd year of college only and I should have much more money by now. I should have developed more friendships in high school and gone out more in my early 20s but I was too stubborn and socially anxious. I should have treated a lot of people better and developed better habits.

I am constantly living in a state of regret and it's killing me emotionally. One thing that is pleasing and emotionally distressing is Nostalgia. Everytime I watch old shows, visit my old school, see okd friends and think about my time as a kid I remember all the good times when it was so simple, the I fast forward to now and realize that I have done nothing. 15 years ago I would have never imagined that I would have been in this situation. These Nostalgic thoughts really drive my suicidal thoughts.

I always think about suicide but I don't think I'd actually do it. I see it as a way out but I know my family and girlfriend would be crushed. The messed up part is that I always think about what I'd say to each person in my suicide note and how they'd react. I would say good things and they'd realize how much I love and appreciate them and shift all of the blame and responsibility of my suicide on me and my issues. I dream about killing myself at one of these Nostalgic locations, reminding me of the good times one last time.

I'm tearing up as I type this.",13Nov2017,3
20,"Maybe ""live in the now"" is not the best term, it's from the Wayne's World movie, I think :p

But, often, people are either thinking about something that happened in their past, or thinking about an upcoming thing in their future. 

I know I spend too much time dwelling about past mistakes and regrets. I have *a lot* of trouble moving on from things, whether it be something that happened earlier in the day, or years ago. 

I have a pretty awesome life with awesome family around me, I'm very lucky, but instead of enjoying my life, I'm usually thinking about not-so-great things that happened in my life and regrets I have. I've been really bad about it lately.

21,"Throughout my pass three years of HS I've missed about 70 days. I wanna say freshman year I missed 10 days. Sophomore year was the worst with me missing 53 days. I switched schools and had a horrible time adjusting. For a second I genuinely thought I was going crazy. My doctor ended up giving me a psych evaluation and referring me to a therapist. I got diagnosed with adhd-pi, an anxiety disorder, and both of these things were continuoulsly causing major depressive episodes. It was an endless cycle of me being anxious and unhappy while not being able to get anything done. I got prescribed meds but my family was against it so I never started taking it. The therapy got discontinued bc of insurance. 

Currently in my junior year and I've missed about 8 days so far for alot of the same reasons as last year. I start therapy again next month and were hoping I can get better this time. I'm breaking my neck to try to maintain my grades and stay on track but it's still harder for me than it should be. Its not as bad as last year(yet) I can't help but think how this will play when it comes to college. Will anyone accept me even if I do manage to raise my GPA?

22,"My mental health is not going very well and I'm not sure why or how. I'm in high school and my grades have noticeably dropped in the past couple years. I'm not putting enough effort into studying. The problem is, I don't know how to study. I can never seem to focus in class and even when I think I understood, I still don't score well. 

I used to be an A student but that was a long time ago. The last couple of tests, I was confident that I studied and was going to get a better mark than usual, but I barely passed. I have no idea what's wrong with me. My parents have been bugging me about this for the past few years and I don't know what to do. 

I can't focus in class, I can't focus while studying, I would constantly wish for mornings where I wouldn't wake up, I never get enough sleep, I have depressive moods, my social life is shit and I'm just generally a mess. 

I have always been a little ""spacey"" and in my own world. My mom used to tell me that I wouldn't respond when people talked to me. She even told me that my uncles urged her into getting my ears checked out because I never seem to answer to them. (I hear just fine)

I'm still very much a person that lives in their own head but there's something that's really been bothering me. I don't seem to remember events that happened in my day.

26,"My friend has a history with mental health, pretty much depression being most of it. Self esteem problems, concentration, anxiety, were all things she suffered with. Over a few years, she started getting headaches which, after a while, came with hearing a voice which seemed to be a type of dissociation. Like, it voiced the things she hated most about herself. Around the same time as the voice, or slightly before, there were also times where she would get a headache and feel depressed, and this would slowly cause her to shut down entirely sometimes for over an hour. She wouldn't move, speak, or acknowledge you. After a few months, she started either scratching herself repeatedly while she was zoned out, or maybe rubbing her hands or something. Then she started having short hallucinations and delusions, all of which she immediately forgot afterwards. Eventually, it got to a point that she dissociated completely and had a split personality. Her second personality was, it seemed, the voice she had heard, and once again she would immediately forget everything she said as the other personality. Then it all stopped when one night her second personality told me something that she shouldn't have told me. It was almost like she was so scared that her other personality would tell me more about it, that she just didn't let it manifest again. Gradually, over six months or so, the voices, 'zoned out' periods, and the headaches stopped as well. Now she still has depressive periods but she's mostly okay.

So what I'm wondering is, is this a common timeline? Are depression and psychosis usually so intimately related that one will lead into the other? Would you say that it's likely that for her depression was part of the psychosis, or that it lead into her dissociation? Is it usual that the symptoms will just disappear as if by force of will?

I’ve NEVER had this problem and I pride myself on my semi-photographic memory but lately it doesn’t seem so good. 


I feel like I have actually gotten dumber. That sounds crazy, but I can’t form words or sentences as fluently or think as rapidly as i used to. 

My appetite fluctuates. I don’t look forward to eating, but I still love it. I seldom actually feel hunger, but I always eat. 

I’m getting annoyed with every little thing, every person, any situation. I get increasingly pissed off over little shit and my temper goes off the handle and I stay mad for a few hours, whereas I used to be able to get over things very quickly. 

I also noticed I’m hearing shit. Not voices, but sounds. Claps, scrapes, sometimes music. It varies. But I know it’s in my end because I cannot physically hear it, but it’s loud and keeps me awake sometimes. Usually I can pretty much silence the sounds, but it’s still weird. No voices thankfully. And it always happens at night. 

I should mention I’m a 24 year old male going through a huge lifestyle change after leaving the military. Idk wtf is going on but I can’t remember the last time I felt really happy. Like really, really happy. Idk if it’s depression but it doesn’t feel like it?

31,"[Go to extremes](https://youtu.be/5xgjtm4_M20) is a song that Billy Joel wrote about his manic depression. It Was Written in the 80s when manic depression was still the commonly used term for bipolar disorder.

This hit me hard.  I have been diagnosed BPD I for years now. . . And I can't believe how misunderstood it still is.  I have heard this song before, but never really listened to it.

34,"Hi all, not sure if anyone is able to provide any insight for me. Basics: I’m 20, female, live in the UK, rent a room in my landlord’s house with her, her teenage son and their dog - along with my dog. I have a job I 98% love not far from where I live.

Starting last year, I’ve recently realised how “ill” I am in that a lot of the things I do and think are just not normal. I won’t go into detail but long story short it’s taken me over a year of fighting with the NHS to get me appointments because I just wanted to get diagnosed and then I could say, okay, X is wrong and I need to fix that to help myself.

A couple of months ago I got diagnosed with BPD (which is what I thought I had - I match all the signs and symptoms extremely well), but they then directed me to continue taking my prescribed antidepressants, and look at online help, which I’ve obviously tried. Now over the past couple of weeks I’ve noticed myself just going downhill - using drugs more, drinking more, shutting myself away in my bedroom (after a full day of work and being happy, I’d rather just be alone with myself and a lot of the time I end up napping all evening), having negative and dark thoughts, being irresponsible with my money (I got paid £1.2k less than 2 weeks ago and now I have £20 left to last me the rest of the month). I’m also just generally not looking after myself, I’m letting my house become a mess along with my car. I feel like I’m jumping from one feeling to another - I’ll be drained and miserable one hour, and cheery and skipping around the office the next, like a yoyo. People at work have noticed a change in me, I was called in to have a private chat and my boss literally said the words “you’re doing laps of the office, you look lost, it’s like you’ve lost the plot” - so I now know I’m being watched. Yada yada yada.

I’ve taken the day off work today to sort myself out which for now mainly involves doing the laundry and sorting out in my house that I’ve been neglecting. I’ve looked into going private to get therapy as the NHS just isn’t willing to help me, however it’s expensive and I can’t afford it, at least not in my current situation.

I’ve talked to my best friend regarding money and we’ve agreed that I’ll give her £200 or so every month for her to save for me, because I know if I have access to it, I’ll spend it. It’s also there if I really do need it, but I’ll have to convince my friend first and she’ll have my best interest as her priority. I’ve set up a budget, not that I haven’t tried before, and I’m going to try to stick to it.

I have no family support - not because they’re not around, but my family are the main cause of a lot of my problems and the reason I moved out of home at 19. The majority of my friends know my situation and though they may not fully understand it, they try to and are sympathetic.

I plan on making myself visit the gym a few times a week, as I enjoy running and the obvious positive physical and mental effects that will come from it.
I’ve tried small hobbies like the adult colouring books but I’m not good at sticking to them for long.

36,"Well had to drop my classes. Was going to fail every one of them. Is it because I'm dumb? No I'm really smart and could get straight a's in my sleep if I would just show up every day and do the course work. I can just learn everything in a college by just listening without taking a single note. I am so gifted with an ability to learn, but I just squander it away because I'm a good for nothing crybaby. I can never get my work done by the due date, I don't show up to class a lot, and that just sabotages me. Why do I not do my work? Why do I not show up to class? Because I'm a piece of shit crybaby that just sits at home and cries that he wants to die. The stupidest part about this is I really enjoy learning. I wasn't feeling so depressed or manic when I was doing good in school a couple months ago.",13Nov2017,2

38,"So, I have been struggling with depression for a long time now. I feel absolutely normal whenever I am with people and having some entertainment. But whenever I try to focus on my academics, or try to do other serious things, this depression takes me in. I have some other health issues too, like digestive issues and low blood presaure, because of which I often feel exhausted and unable to focus or concentrate on serious things. I feel weak and do not have the mood to do anything at evenings. This has become a regular routine, and is affecting my academic performance. I need some advice on how do I get better, other than the fact that I need to have medications and a mental health counseling maybe. I would also like to know if you have passed or are passing through a similar situation, and how did you recover?  ",13Nov2017,1
39,"In my government class, we do a lot of group projects and presentations. I’m extremely extremely shy and have a lot of anxiety when working with other people. But what’s even worse is that most of the people in that class were the people who bullied me freshman year.

This is causing me extreme anxiety and I haven’t done multiple assignments because of it. I’m failing the class now. Can someone help me figure out the best way to tell my teacher about my anxiety? I’m hoping that if i tell him, we can work out my assignments to where I don’t have to present them to the class. I was going to email him, but I’m not sure on how to word the email. ",13Nov2017,2

She will forget something then verbally lash out at me when I try to help her remember. Shes extremely violent sometimes. Just now, she accused me of eating her cans of chilli. I dont eat chilli as I am a bit of a health nut. This happens frequently then she continues to fall asleep like nothing happened, forgetting about. Im seriously losing my mind. Idk what to do. Should I just move out and force to government to get her a carer. Should I put her in a home. I had to drop out of my last year of college to care for her. I dont want to be here anymore but im not sure id be able to make it on my own. She lashes out physically from time to time so I cant discuss this with her. Am I a horrible son? ",13Nov2017,1
41,"I was speaking to my psychiatrist and he mentioned that my anxiety attacks and depression seem like a ""chicken &amp; egg"" situation...
I never thought of it that way, but it's the perfect way to describe this.
I have no clue if my depression (which hits harder during winter; but not exclusive to winter) is causing anxiety; or if my anxiety attacks (which are triggered by certain events in life) throw me into a depressed state.
Does anyone else feel this way?",13Nov2017,5

43,"I’ve struggled with anxiety since being a teenager, but 2/3 weeks ago it’s started to affect my sleep. It takes me almost 3 hours to fall asleep and when I wake up, I’ve got massive headaches and still feel tired no matter how long I sleep for. My muscles hurt a lot more too, from being tense.
The next day, I am much more anxious and on edge from the lack of sleep and it’s really impacting my studies and everyday life. 
My doctor has suggested anti depressants before but I’ve always been reluctant.
This may sound silly but my biggest concern is the  weight gain that some people experience when going on anti depressants. 

What are your thoughts, have anti depressants worked for you? Or are the sleeping pills that can help with falling asleep?

44,"My MIL is interesting. While she can be fun, caring, and possesses a lot of other great qualities there are 2 tendencies that I can't understand in a compassionate way and I would like to. 

I also need to make sure my boundaries are set appropriately. 

Fist - She is extremely quick to cry and put her emotions center stage. 

I have come to surmise this is most likely because she is sad about other things in her life so crying is always just below the surface. I also believe or would like to that the center staging of her emotions are because her marriage put her feelings in the back seat and now that she is older that is manifesting this way. I do not think she is a narcissist.   

Secondly - She is very very very easily disappointed by others - her family specifically. Not disappointed IN THEM but by them. This one I am very curious about because it hurts her adult children the most. Ex. She wants to invite them (adult children) over for a BBQ which is awesome, but one of them declines because she/he is going out the night before for existing plans and knows it will be a very late night. That person disappoints her greatly, and feels guilty. 

Looking to open a discussion. I tried searching for this online but it's buried by ""How do I stop being disappointed in others"" articles, not the kind of causality or purpose of the behavior when used to inflict guilt.

49,"I've been dealing with al ot of stuff lately -- I had surgery a couple of weeks ago, I am struggling financially and dealing with some medical debt. I'm in school, but I can't find the motivation to study. I get my work done, but haphazardly, and not putting as much work in as I could. Part of it is burn out; I'll be graduating in the Spring, but I just want to be done now. 

I think the surgery has really put me in a funk. I'm prone to being depressive, but usually I can keep my mood pretty stable with exercise and keeping myself busy. However, I've been forced to be sedentary as a result of this surgery, and so I don't really have an outlet to make me feel better. 

I guess I'll feel better in a couple of weeks when I'm recovered and able to get back to my normal activities, but I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. My days right now have basically been cycling through reddit, facebook, twitter, and instagram. I hate that I spend so much time on these websites, but I don't have the patience to do anything else.

50,"I had previously been on 2mg of clonazepam/ day and weaned myself down to 1mg, at the suggestion of a doctor who said I may build a tolerance and need to increase my dosage more over the years. For years (I think it’s been 4 years or so), the anxiety meds were all I needed, and I thought I had finally found the right medication for me. 

Recently, I’ve become depressed again &amp; I went to a new doctor to seek advice. I agreed to begin taking Zoloft again with the possibility of getting off taking clonazepam regularly. I am filled with fear at the thought of not having anxiety pills if I need one. I suffer from social anxiety and I’m a waitress, so I find that I need them fairly often.

I also just quit drinking alcohol after being dependent for around 10 years. I probably should have been more open with my doctor about this aspect. I have been sober for 18 days now, on Zoloft for 15. It’s just a lot. And I can’t imagine going through this transition without my anxiety meds. Before starting the clonazepam, I had never been able to hold down a full time job and pay bills on my own.

Overall, I just want to be better. No matter what it takes to get there. I am afraid of the road ahead. I am afraid of not having my anxiety pills to fall back on. Any advice or encouragement would be so helpful. Thank you for reading, sorry for the rambling!",13Nov2017,3

52,"I 100% guarantee this is true.  
  
[NPR.org: Cellphones over-excite brain cells leading to changes in cell metabolism linking cell phones to chemical imbalances in the brain.](https://www.npr.org/2011/02/22/133968220/cell-phone-radio-waves-excite-brain-cells)   
  
The US government hacks phones, and increases the RF (radiofrequency) emitted turning cellphones into silent brain killers. They target truthers, conspiracy theorists, and people who ask too many questions. It's an automated system that targets people mostly indiscreetly but there are some human hands involved in hacking nearby wireless devices. This is being done in the name of ""War on Terror"". The US has already been given the right to assassinate US citizens on US soil but they are doing it descretely to avoid public outrage.  
  
YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW. Radiofrequency is radiation, it doesn't affect your nerves so you wouldn't feel it. Just like sunlight, getting a little is fine but if you turn up the heat, it burns. At least with a sunburn, you can see your arms turning red and it hurts. RF burns up the cells in your brain where you have no nerves, IT'S A SILENT KILLER.  
  
I KNOW THIS IS 100% TRUE. Devices operate at a SAR value and cause no health problems to people but the government hacks phones to operate above this level, discretely targeting people they don't want around.  
  
Even doubters, look at the history of telecommunication devices and the risen rates of mental illness in the US. Commerical cellphones were introduced to the US market 1983. Ever since there's been an exponential incline of mental illness in America.  
  
It makes sense. The N-S-A also targets co-travelers so if you developed mental problems, just think, did anyone you're close to develop problems too? Like cancer, autoimmune disease, develop depression?   
  
I guarantee this is 100% true.",13Nov2017,0
53,"- 20-year-old second year student, on 4 year competitive health professions course.
- Poor attendance, and have missed work, quite behind, applied for some extensions
- Long term mental health problems (dep, bpd) – which are worsening

QUESTION: REMAIN IN UNIVERSITY OR TAKE A YEAR OUT? (BUT WILL HAVE TO BEGIN THE WHOLE COURSE AGAIN) 

Pros (of taking a year out)
- Would allow myself to have a break IF I got better, taking the pressure off myself
- Would allow me to enjoy the course more (if I recovered on a year out) instead of just trying to get by, learn more
- If I was feeling better at home I could get a job or volunteer – however have done this in the past and hasn’t necessarily helped
- Make money and save
- Have never really had time to recover from the death of my best friend on course who died traumatically in front of my eyes – while we were on holiday together 

Cons (of taking a year out)
- would miss NHS funding (I am in the last year for funding)
- changing nature of the course (being compressed into 3 years instead of 4) would mean I might have to start the course again as modules have changed – expensive and would be starting first year at 21
- uni gives me something to focus on – at home I might just stay in bed and if I didn’t recover at home then I don’t know whether I would return to uni at all. Often distraction (uni) Is the best policy for depression.
- upcoming experimental treatment for depression – could really help me – not as much point of getting it, if I’m just going to be at home – it’s expensive, I would prefer it to help me feel better at uni
- House – just payed massive deposit and have a house to pay for the rest of the year
- boyfriend is at uni
- don’t have any friends at home – make me worse? Missing out/ failure
- doctors who know me and my situation are relatively easy to access at uni and start counselling soon – more support available
- I have things planned and to look forward too – would have to cancel them if I was going home

I would appreciate any thoughts, comments or even experiences of those who have been in similar situations. I am completely stuck! Thank you",13Nov2017,1

56,"I find there are things I want to do (buy an electric guitar for example) but when I decide to go out, for some reason I feel anxiety and shame, and keep telling myself I'll look stupid walking down the street with and amp and a guitar. I do this a lot, not just with that, but with other things too. I'm always afraid to go out and buy things I want, or do things I want. I feel like I don't belong there, or I have no business there.  This includes going to venues I've never been before.  I feel weird. As a result I avoid unfamiliar places, things, and activities. It either feels ""lame"" or inappropriate.  I avoid shopping for new things too.  I hate going to stores. Even clothes stores, I feel weird shopping.  I don't know if this is anxiety or what it is. ",13Nov2017,7

So recently I've made up my mind - I'm gonna get antidepressants. I have tried everything, and my doctor gave me the option to go on medication. She told me to think about it before, and gave me a brochure to read through. It lists the 7 main drugs prescribed here in the UK, and they include the names of the brands as well. 

So I was thinking - should I research the drugs specifically, or should I just ask my doctor which one she thinks is the most suitable? I don't wanna go in there ""demanding"" the one I like based on the effects and side effects, but I also wanna know what I'm getting myself into.

59,"I can't handle school. From former honor roll, to failing 3 of 4 of my core classes in just a couple months. I have no motivation to work with the broken and demoralizing system anymore. I feel like I'm being torn down more and more every day, and I can't stand a single day of it. 
But the law requires me to deal with it for 3 more years, 1.5 if I want to drop out, just so I can get a piece of paper that says I can work entry level at Walmart. 
I'm sitting here crying in psychological agony at the work they give me that everyone else is whisking through. I decided to try to get help — then I learned school counselors don't actually want to help you. They want to drive you closer and closer to killing yourself then call your behavior disturbing.
Physically and emotionally beat down, repressed, and neglected by a system that was supposed to empower and protect me, I don't know what to do anymore. I can't do it.  
I tried getting help from a ""professional"" who doesn't quite know what to do with me.  I've been to several therapists. All of them have came out with similar results. We lessened my anxiety, but the school situation remains unsolved.

60,"I'm 23 with a growing collection of mental illnesses.   I didn't realize it until a few months ago that my mother was an abusive parent.  She used to scream at me and my siblings a lot.  She neglected us regularly and I don't have a lot of memories of her when I was young but most of the time I just remember her screaming and throwing things.

As an adult I feel like an absolute failure.  I don't know what I'm doing and I daily struggle with crippling depression and anxiety.  I had to move back in with my parents over the summer because I wasn't able to afford to live on my own.  I've been getting better but last night I had a massive anxiety attack and my mother got angry with me.  I completely went off on her.  I don't know what came over me, I just went from screaming and panicking on the floor to screaming at her. 
Now my siblings are angry with me and I've been told that I need to apologize.  I know how I reacted to her was wrong but I honestly don't know how I can apologize to her.

I don't know how to fix this mess.  I'm scared that I've fucked up too much and I can't change who I am.  I'm going to be just like my mother.  I want to be gentle and kind and caring but sometimes I just feel angry.  I hate it.   ",13Nov2017,5
