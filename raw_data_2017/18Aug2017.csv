1,"Patient is 21 years old tells the psychiatrist she has OCD. She explains symptoms ""such as walking back and forth, repeating certain phrases, counting steps,"" etc. Patient said her OCD is becoming unmanageable and she needs medication. Doc asks checklist questions about OCD which you can only answer ""yes"" or ""no"" to such as ""do you wash hands"" ""do you arrange objects"" ""do you have religious obsessions""? Doc asks a bunch of questions about the patient's history. Then he asks to speak to the patient's mother, who is in the waiting room. Patient says no but doc says he needs to ask a few questions. Doc asks questions about history such as marriage, pregnancy, young child, etc. Then mom starts complaining about patient sleeping all day, how her husband started yelling everywhere for something patient did last night, etc. Patient tells mom to be quiet but doc insists she let her mom speak. Doc says patient has no regime and thought a residential facility would help with establishing a regime. He thought the patient was too smart for a residential facility and suggested a supported apartment. He asks the patient about her career plans who she wants to become. He said to call a family service organization that offers a supported apartment and employment training. In the end patient asked doc why he didn't prescribe meds. Doc thought patient didn't need meds. Patient asks what is he going to do about the OCD and he answers with the dismissive gesture that he will treat the OCD.",18Aug2017,14

4,"Hi. I'm not 100% sure this is ok to post here, but in all honesty I'm kinda at the end of my rope here. I don't really know what I want out of this, maybe just some outsider advice? I'm just stuck. 

Ok, so I'm 18. I've dealt with anxiety and depression since I was around 13. I have other issues as well, and I know more or less where each of them came from. The problem is that I'm at the point where I seriously just don't know what the hell I'm doing anymore. 

So, to fully grasp my problem, I'm gonna try to go over each of the mental issues I'm struggling with and where they came from without writing novels for each one.

The anxiety is something that kinda came out of nowhere, but also came from one singular event in 8th grade. I had a friend group, and two of the guys were going back and forth dating this girl. Eventually she got fed up and tore us apart from the inside. She spread rumors about each of us and I got the worst of it because I was the closest to figuring her shit out. I got beat up and harassed so bad I went to live with my abusive dad, who I'll get to in a minute. 

The depression also came from that, and worsened with medication. But what kicked it off and really has kept it from stopping is when my grandfather died in 2014. He was pretty much my dad. I'm still a wreck over it mostly because I feel like where I am with my life and what I want to do would have disappointed him. In all honesty that's my greatest fear is being a disappointment to him, or anyone for that matter. I just want to be able to make literally anyone proud of who I am or what I've done but I feel like nothing I do will ever be enough. The depression is the worst of them to me. There are days where I'll be having a good time and all that but then something will click and I'll be 100% ready to eat a gun. 

I don't know what to call this one. An eating disorder? PTSD? Both? I don't know. This one is my birth Dad's fault and is about 55% of why I'd prefer to never talk to him again. When I was growing up, before my parents divorced, he was a super strict parent. He would tell me that I was going to eat whatever he prepared or I was gonna go hungry. But, sometimes he would, likely because he was drunk 99% of the time, try to force feed me shit I didn't like or want. I have a particularly vivid memory of him smashing a bowl of mashed potatoes in my face. I was 4. This shit has ruined my diet. I eat all of about 3 different things as meals and I get, for lack of a better word, triggered whenever I attempt to try something new. I've given up on it, honestly. My mouth just refuses to close when I want to try a new food. I don't eat around friends because I'm paranoid that they'll make fun of me for something I can't help.

I'm just lost, guys. I'm tired of all of this. There are days, much like today, where I want nothing more than to just roll over and die but I don't because I keep telling myself that eventually I could be a good person. I just don't know if I can keep lying to myself. I feel like I'm a prisoner. My anxiety is convincing me that everyone I care about hates me. My depression makes me hate myself. I'm just so god damned tired of feeling like I'm 1000 miles below rock bottom every time I look in the mirror. This isn't normal for someone my age. I shouldn't be this depressed. I shouldn't be the way I am but nothing I do ever changes anything. Writing all this out didn't help me either. I feel like suicide is all I have left but I'm way too scared to do anything like that. I'm just lost. 

Everything feels dark.",18Aug2017,17

7,"I'm wondering if life will ever truly be okay. I feel as though I was dealt a horrible hand in life and to top it off I'm going through the process of taking new meds for bipolar disorder, which really only amplifies the feelings of mania and depression that I feel. 

I know people say that things will be okay, but in my experience life always manages to get worse and dumbfound me with its chaos. It's almost as if the happy times in life are less valuable because I know that soon, life will deteriorate once again.

10,"My boyfriend suffers from severe depression, anxiety and insomnia. However, he has never been able to seek professional help for any of these things, mainly due to the fact that his parents ""do not believe in mental illness"". We are both 18 years of age and live in Canada, and I'm almost certain that you cannot get in to see a therapist without parental consent until the age of 19 here. (I've been to therapy myself before, and recall that information being stated on the papers). Plus, the cost of therapy is pretty high anyway. Even if he was of age, I'm not sure he could afford it. 
It hurts me to see him in so much pain, and it also interferes with our relationship quite frequently. I'm really not sure what to do, or how to help him. I can be supportive, but I am no trained professional. I'm just looking for any suggestions, thanks",19Aug2017,1

15,"28/F. I went through what has turned out to be a shatteringly traumatic breakup about 2 months ago. He was the absolute love of my life, I didn't see it coming and I basically stayed in denial for this entire time.

It was a really unhealthy situation. I stayed living with him for a few weeks, but we had a big fight and he kicked me out. I lived in a rundown motel for a few weeks. He'd drive me to work everyday. I was an emotional wreck, drinking everyday, and I'd beg him to stay the night. I was so lonely and fucking depressed and missed him more than I could imagine missing anyone. We'd have sex and cuddle and I then in the morning it's like it never happened. He was never unclear that we were broken up, couldn't be together. At least not much. He suffers from mental health issues and he's been in a depressive state for a few months without treatment.

Then I found out he'd been seeing someone since basically day 1 of the breakup. He loves her and she loves him. Their relationship has been intense and very fast moving. He lied to her everyday and to me. He made me the other woman, yet I feel cheated on. We had unprotected sex every time. I felt used and dirty for participating in cheating, yet I irrationally hate and envy her because she has him and he was mine.

 I finally felt like I couldn't go on another minute feeling this way and had a complete breakdown. I screamed and cried and he showed almost no emotion which really seems to fuck with me. He says he's hurting as bad as I am, but it doesn't seem that way and I can't understand it. We were together two years, had a life together. 

I made him call her and while he basically sat silent on the phone I loudly stated everything that had been going on. She heard every terrible detail. She stayed with him even though their barely 6 week old relationship was built on a foundation of daily lies and cheating. 

I cracked and had him bring me to the hospital because I couldn't stand it anymore. I don't know if I was actually suicidal, but I needed the pain to stop. I was admitted for a week and released today. I've been diagnosed with depression, adjustment disorder and schizo-affective disorder. I was put on Prozac. I have a follow-up appointment in ten days. I was feeling good the last two days, then he picked me up because I have no one really and it all came crashing down again. I had a panic attack and I feel like something has actually broken in my brain. It's a feeling I can't describe. He's decided we need to be no contact for at least a few months because of his new relationship and he needs to heal. None of this feels real. I left the hospital today and it's as if I have no real memory of being there, like it was a foggy dream. I feel like I recognized most of the patients and staff there. There was a patient my first day that no one else seemed to notice. 

I've been stable my entire life, never diagnosed with anything. Now I'm homeless, jobless and I think I'm completely broken. I originally wanted to write this to ask about mania because I haven't slept in two days and don't feel tired and my thoughts are all over the place. I can't sleep or focus. I think seeing him again after everything that's happened broke me. He looked terrible too and said he's been drinking and living a very unhealthy life this whole time too.

I don't know where I'm going with this but I just wanted to get it out. I'm not suicidal right now, I just feel shattered. I feel like I fell asleep one day and woke up in an alternate reality. ",19Aug2017,1

17,"WARNING: The following is the true story of how I tried to kill myself, which includes graphic details. 
 
I remember it so clearly. The car. The desert. Silence. Everything is still. And it is pitch black. 

Then, a bright light. 

The piercing beam of my flashlight glints off the blade of my knife. 

My heart is racing but I am not afraid. There is simply a deep pain buried somewhere in my chest. An unshakable sadness. 

I know what I have to do. The radial artery is easy to find. I feel my pulse in my wrist as I’ve done many times before to patients in the back of my ambulance. 

I press the knife to my skin, close my eyes, and start sawing. 

I have cut myself before, but this time I know it will have to be deeper. It will have to be fast. And hopefully it will be bloody. 

I now feel the knife dig into my skin and warm blood start to run down my arm. A moment of panic sweeps over me but I only saw faster. I start screaming, not from pain but from sheer emotional overload. But it’s impossible to describe what I was feeling. 

Finally I open my eyes and look down at the mess I’ve made. I first notice the cut is very deep, and spitting my wrist open. But I notice something even more concerning. The blood is dark red and flowing. A veinous bleed. I’ve missed the artery. I might not die. I start hyperventilating. 

And go back at it with the knife. 

It’s nothing like the movies. It’s far worse. Cutting your wrists open is not a quick and clean slice with a razor and then just relaxing into sleep as depicted in “Thirteen Reasons Why.” It’s far more difficult. And more violent. 

The physical pain starts to really set in as my knife goes back into the split in my skin. I begin screaming again as I violently shake my arm in an attempt to get more blood to flow out of my wrist. I just want it to be done. 

But the blood is clotting. Grabbing at the wound and holding it open I pour water in it and go back to shaking. My car is a mess. The windows, doors, and floor are covered in splatters of blood and water. 

The last of the water runs off my wrist. I stop what I’m doing and just stare at the trickle of blood running down my arm. 

I’ve failed. I don’t want to keep trying. This is torture. This is the worst moment in my life. For a minute I am calm. I’m not going to die today. And at this point I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing. 

The rest of the night is calm. Sitting in the ER. Sutures being pulled through my skin. Another concerned nurse telling me yet again that suicide is bad. 
But they will probably never know what it feels like. And I hope they never have to.",19Aug2017,4

I have one big problem that has bern plagueing me since I was around 16-17. Currently I'm almost 24 but I've yet to solve it.

The problem is... I cannot at the same time enjoy life and feel feelings and be in control of myself in terms of self discipline and concentration.

When I relax I feel good, but I make more mistakes and am less smart due to not focusing when thinking.

When being in control of myself I am smarter, make less mistakes and get better results at just about anything, but I quickly run out of energy, feel a lot more irritated all the time and basically supress my feelings.

Saying that there's 'coded messages' in his house. He'll be at work and be tearing apart his phone, work radio, headlamp, etc. looking for microphones and cameras. This morning he was convinced that someone was at his house with his wife and had us leave work(we ride together) to go find out. He was visibly angry, i.e. shaking, breathing hard. When we arrived at his house he and his wife instantly started yelling and screaming at each other. I stayed in the driveway in the event that either of them got physical. After they had calmed down he came to talk to me and asked me if I heard a 'ringing sound.' When I said that I didn't he said that I was crazy for not hearing it. This all has been building for the past month and a half or so. When it started it seemed strange, but mental illness was the furthest thing from my mind. He's my friend. I want to believe him, you know? But now, there is very little doubt that he is suffering from some type of psychosis. My questions are, should I continue to listen to his delusions or should I shut him down as soon as he brings these things up? How should I go about encouraging him to seek help? Is there a hotline or something that I can call to speak to a psychologist to get some more information? Is there physical changes that I should be looking for that might indicate that this is not exclusively mental? If he refuses professional help, what can I do as his friend to help him?

---

People Involved:  

* Jill:  Autistic and Type 1 Diabetic - Teen (Youngest daughter of Mom)   
* Mom: Grown kids from different fathers, Teen daughter in question – Jill only child of “Dad”  
* Dad: Sexual predator, manipulative, evil (I have never applied this term to another human)  
* Me: Spouse of (2nd) youngest daughter   
* Wife: 2nd Youngest Daughter   
* Sister 1, Sister 2, Brother 1   

&amp;nbsp;

**Family History**

Mom had 2 children, met new guy and had 2 more (1 of them my wife).  Met “Dad” and had another child late in life, Jill, when other siblings were teens.   Dad “lightly” molested sister 2 and severely molested Brother 1, Dad also severely molested many of brother’s friends while an active member in a children’s community (15 years ago, current situation unknown).  Dad encouraged substance abuse with Mom and kids.  Mom finally divorced Dad when Jill was younger, about 5 years ago.  Dad has never answered or been confronted about his crimes.  Dad has weekend parental rights.

&amp;nbsp;

Mom is clean from illicit drugs but has prescriptions.  Does not have a strong personality or protective motherly instincts, and is easily confused and flustered.  Some people would say aloof, I would say she's just out of it.  “Tries hard” but continues to make bad decisions with men and is always at stress level 10.   Works a low paying job with no outside support from friends, family.    

&amp;nbsp;

Jill (to try to keep this brief I am only listing her negatives) Sweet but very difficult child.  She is a type 1 diabetic and diagnosed autistic (Asperger’s).  She was a “wild child” who was inappropriate and very difficult to deal with.  Very little discipline at home but also extremely hard to discipline.  Morbid fascination with videos of police brutality, S&amp;M/Bondage, people falling and breaking legs.  She also engages in self destructive behavior like twisting her hair into knots so her hair is cut short and unevenly, which leads to bullying.  Has hurt animals in the past. Dad provides a large smartphone for Jill and Mom.  Easiest way to quiet Jill is to let her disappear on phone.  Dad keeps tabs on them via phones and manipulates from the background.  Dad intentionally causes emotional strife and instigates a crisis whenever possible.    

&amp;nbsp;

There is debate within the family if the Asperger’s diagnosis is accurate.  She is hyper-active and has no filter, ""Why are you so fat"" ""Hey you're retarded! I'm handicapped too, I have Aspergers"".  I have met other children on the spectrum and their behavior is typically much different. 

&amp;nbsp;

As Jill is turning the corner into her teenage years she is no longer sweet or innocent and is starting to get into “real” trouble.  Example:  Called 911 from a public place to report a (fake) shooting, luckily she was let go with a warning.  She is bullied mercilessly at school and has no friends.  Mom left some (legal) “uppers” out (ADHD medication mom takes) and she took some and loved it.  Please forgive me for saying this, but Jill is extremely unpleasant to be around.   Her diabetes is very poorly managed and routinely hits 600.    

&amp;nbsp;

Jill attempted suicide at her school yesterday by flooding herself with insulin (she is required to be on a pump 24/7).  She has attempted suicide multiple times and has spent many nights locked into the children’s psyche ward for observation.   Jill takes a cocktail of medications (not sure what exactly).  

&amp;nbsp;

Mom is trying to get her into some sort of program in school, so she can be around other children that are hopefully not so brutal as well as school administrators who care.  Apparently, the school thinks she is just “misbehaving”.  The school sucks.  Mom is hesitant to push the school too hard because her employment is affected.

&amp;nbsp;

Mom tries her best but frankly has made poor decisions and just can’t seem to get it together.  The brother is in prison, the sisters have enjoyed varying levels of success but are extremely traumatized by Dad (not their biological Dad, but their step-dad), so there is a lot of hand wringing over Jill but not much action.  The other sisters have emotionally distanced themselves from their mother and by extension, Jill.   The visits to Dad are a much-needed break for Mom.

---

I am advocating for both my wife and Jill here.  If something isn’t done she will at best, live a desperate and confusing life, and at worst kill herself.  My wife has told her therapist about the abuse and it has been reported. The statute of limitations precludes any legal action (I think), that or nobody in the “system” gives a shit.  My wife is the only one in close contact with Mom still, and goes through phases of frustration when trying to help and periods of distance when it gets overwhelming.   The emotional stress is negatively affecting her life.  Her relationship is very rocky with her mom and she would have distanced herself emotionally from her if not for Jill.  

&amp;nbsp;

I need advice on what to do and where to start.  There are obvious emotional reactions “get her away from that monster”, but this is real life with court orders and a Mom who seems incapable.  I would like to put together a “checklist” of positive actions she can take moving forward, Mom needs to be told or directed what to do.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally – Dad is no longer physically capable of unwanted **physical** abuse 

&amp;nbsp;

I tried to paint a thorough picture without writing a novel, if something is unclear please ask.  Thank you to anyone who can help or offer advice.

30,"Hey Reddit, throw away for reasons.



At the moment I'm suffering from horrific paranoia in my relationship, 

At the start of the relationship I told him that I cannot and will not stand for porn use in the relationship, this is something that is very important to me. 

He goes away on business trips some times for 5 days some for two-three weeks, 

I asked him to promise me not to use it on trips, he agreed  

His sex drive died a few months ago and has been struggling to come back 

Recently when he came back from a last Trip I found a sock,  he told me he wasn't going to promise he hasn't used it, had never promised me anything and wasn't going to promise to never use it. 

Since then my trust has gone down 95%  I am paranoid about what he's doing constantly, it makes me feel physically ill. 

I'm not sure where to go from here. 
I don't want to lose him because of this, every day is a constant paranoid fuelled hell though ",19Aug2017,1
31,"Hello! I'm 20, female, Canada. I'm here not for a diagnosis, but just for overall advice(s) on my situation. Feel free to talk about your own situation/problems/experiences. 
A few months ago, I read a story from an Internet friend of mine who's Asperger, and for some reason, after reading it, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that something was missing. I started researching Asperger and all that jazz. 
One moment I'd strongly identify with it, the next, I'd freak out (because I feel like I'm always, always exaggerating everything I feel and what I relate to) and tell myself it would be impossible for me to have Asperger's. 
I decided to take an appointment with a psychologist who does mental health assessment, and as soon as I mentioned that, she said she didn't think I had Asperger because she didn't feel the ""lack of connection"" she did with Aspergers she had met/evaluated before. She thinks I might have giftedness instead because I mentioned I was always very good at school and that I could get bored in class (hence the constant drawing, moving my legs and hands, etc., but that was mostly true for language classes and philosophical concepts, otherwise maths would need my attention even when trying to focus felt like too much, too hard). 
The thing is, I feel like giftedness wouldn't explain my social difficulties or my obsessive habits and such. I just read a graphic novel about a girl with Asperger's, and I identified so strongly with the character that I wanted to cry. But then again, I might be dumb, and I know giftedness could also explain a hypersensibility to sounds, textures, textiles and all that stuff. And I'm pretty sure giftedness could be related to OCD and other things like that. 
And recently, my obsessive thoughts are so intense (and I work full-time in a place that's draining me) I feel the need to hurt myself, punch myself, etc. etc. etc. I am just so tired, guys, no energy whatsoever, and so this week I have to meet my doctor for blood tests and all, and I've started therapy and I like the psy, but it still feels like because I don't know what I have, I can't focus, I can't feel okay. 
And ah. My attention span. It's terrible. I can focus on the things I like, I could always focus on school, but for more than a year or two, everything concerning my ability to focus (on conversations, on a task, on responsabilities, etc.) is just none. That could be explained by my constant fatigue, and yet, I just... I don't know. 
I feel so stupid for everything I just mentioned. Thinking this. Daring to think this. My parents say I'm a hypocondriac, and that's one more reason to not take everything I say seriously (ex: when I'm nauseous and scared I'll vomit, etc.), and in the end it makes me feel like I can't even trust my own feelings/impressions. I also have that ""all or nothing"" mentality, which drives my girlfriend crazy, and changes in my schedule can result in extreme mood swings. 
In a way, it's always been like that. I've always had obsessive tendencies or habits or passions, always had a feeling that I just wasn't on the same page as others, didn't understand all the ""boys flirt with girls"" thing in highschool, and ever since I was very young, always felt like I wasn't ""girly"" enough, I've been anxious, went through phases of either emotional dependency to one person or eating disorders, suicidal ideas, and... Well. Anyway. It's difficult to summarize everything, but I'm tired. Really tired. What should I do? I'm scared I'm making everything worse than it is, and to be honest with you all, I find it real difficult to draw the line between what is neurotypical and neuroatypical. I mean, all the little things I spend my entire days analysing about myself, they might not even be a sign of ""something"". I wish I wasn't such a drama queen lol. 
What about your own experiences? Feelings on that? Really, feel free to comment anything. I'm just to a point where I don't know what to do anymore. And that feeling of exhaustion - it keeps on coming back through the years, be it because of school, work, whatever, really. Thanks!

34,"Hey reddit. Nothing too deep here, I'm just looking for some advice. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist coming up. I've never seen one before, or even had any mental health treatment. I'm just a little nervous and need advice. I don't actually know what happens at a psychiatrist so I think that's part of where my unease comes from. Thanks y'all",19Aug2017,5
35,"Hey there reddit. For about half an hour I have been at home, alone. My parents went off for a drive somewhere, and after they left, I went into my room and just started crying hard and feeling bad for no reason (there probably is a reason, it's just I don't know the reason yet). My parents go out together a lot and sometimes me and my brother don't like it, (usually only gone for 30 To 60 minutes) but I have never cried. In the past, I have considered the thought that there could be something wrong with my head, but I usually pass it off as me just being moody or hormones or something. I have being laying in my bed a lot recently and not doing anything constructive with my life, but that could just be because I don't have school. When I am at school and with family, I am a perfectly normal person. I am an honor roll student, a 3 sport athlete, and I have great social skills. But when I am at home with my parents and brother, I am a whole different person. I like to cook, play guitar, and do woodworking. It's just that nobody else knows that. Sometimes I just feel so disconnected from friends. I have never had a friend come over to my house, and I never really go to parties. There are a lot of people that I wish I was closer to, but I never see them. Sometimes I will hold back from getting teary eyed when a family member asks me who my best friend is, because I don't really have one. I get frustrated over stuff like that a lot. I usually hold it back and don't think about it, because I know that i am gifted and have a good life, it's just that sometimes I don't feel like that",19Aug2017,3
