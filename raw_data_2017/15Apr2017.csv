0,"Getting a formal diagnosis, or at the very least finding a medical term that fits all the symptoms/emotions you're experiencing is just... so reassuring. Like wow, I'm not just crazy. And more importantly, I'm not alone. I can find support groups. I can talk to a therapist about this and not worry they are going to send me to psych ward. I'm not just being a lazy fuck. This is especially true for me since I grew up in a culture where mental illness isn't really recognised/acknowledged. So in dealing with mental illness, I genuinely thought that I was the only person in the world experiencing what I was experiencing. 

This has basically gone for all mental illness in my life: I was depressed for nine months and thought I was just lazy and incompetent (had no idea depression even existed); I'd have panic attacks and ruminate constantly, thinking I was a crazy, burdensome freak when in fact I had anxiety. You just realise that's you're diagnosable, recognisable and can be ""treated"" by therapy. So I'd just feel so much safer -- less alone. It's hard to explain. 

Yes, I still have to deal with the struggle, self-doubt and *constant* rumination that comes with battling depression (on and off), EDs (mostly gone), OCD, anxiety, etc. And I'm still working up the confidence to go to therapy. But I deal with these things knowing that I'm not crazy, and I'm not alone. I guess that's why access to mental health info is **so** important.

4,"Hey everyone

I'm someone who never really had the commitment for prolonged studying, I mostly sit down 2 days before an exam and fast read the material a couple of times. That's in the past, during my 2nd medical school year (after the mid-term exams of the first semester to be exact) I couldn't bring myself to sit down an hour and study anything. My 2nd semester mid-term marks average around 10/30 (randomly solving mcqs) and finals are in 3 weeks, I don't attend my lectures because insomnia has to intensify my life so I sleep really late and end up waking exhausted and well, empty. I really have 0 knowledge and the frightening thing is that I'm not totally bothered with this mess. On the other part of the equation you can find my triggered thus triggering parents who still think I'm the golden boy I've always been in school, my father is constantly criticising everything I do although I sat with him more than once telling him about what the hell is going on inside my head, the sad thing is that he should be the first to understand because he's a doctor and an extremely knowledgeable one at that but he, for quite unknown reasons doesn't. My mom nagging constantly had me shout at her more than once, it's out of my hand and fortunately I'm not feeling guilty as I've always did. 

A lot of my friends know, I have really good ones, the problem is that whenever I want to go out and breathe some air, they're studying which depresses me even more.

My real problem lies within my motivation, I have none as of the moment, don't find life to be exciting nor wirth sacrificing, thus I have no reason to study, that said, inside me I know that I want to study and pass, AT LEAST to avoid the bothering, ruinous and awkward consequences that would befall with my family, friends and acquaintances. Going to a therapist/drugs are not an option. Im truly lost and have no idea what to do next, I know that a temporary solution is more important than a permanent one right now so that's a start.

Isn't it just great when your parents don't want to admit to themselves that their son has a mental disorder. ",15Apr2017,3

9,"I've always struggled with recurring, vivid nightmares, but usually they were just strange enough for me to know they're not real when I wake up. 

But lately, I'm struggling with a recurring nightmare that leaves me shaking and often crying when I wake up. The dream goes like this:

I'm walking with a friend, usually I have my guitar with me, I can't see my friends face. Suddenly a man approaches us. He's saying something but I don't know what. He started getting violent and starts grabbing at me and my friend. My friend turns and runs away, I try to as well, but the man grabs my guitar and hits me with it. I fall to the ground and start trying to crawl away, but he puts his foot on my back and stops me. He then starts pulling my clothes off, and then he rapes me. 

The dream is more vivid than any dream I've ever had and so realistic that it's making me wonder whether or not it's actually a repressed memory. I should also mention that I never see the mans face, him and the friend are just blank faces. I usually wake up in a cold sweat from this dream, often crying. 

Even if it's not a memory and it is just a dream, is there any way to stop it? I've been having this dream off and on for over a year now. ",15Apr2017,1

14,"I just made this throwaway. 

For the curious, I'm Indian ^^\(by ^^genetics ^^and ^^passport, ^^anyway) I was born and raised in Dubai UAE (where I went to a Catholic school teaching the British GCSE syllabus), then I went to Virginia USA for my degree, then went to Goa, India after I couldn't find a job. I'm Indian by nationality and nothing else. I don't know the languages and can't learn them so I'm out of place here in many ways.

I'm a 27 year old guy and have never had a meaningful relationship or close friendship in my life. Never had a pet. Never had anything or anyone I can describe as a 'best friend' in any mature sense. My relationship with my parents can best be described as 'genial'. Both parents worked, but my mom usually came home earlier. When my dad came home he tended to play bridge online, a lot. There was a sports club we were a part of, but my dad mostly went there to play billiards and snooker. Yes, there was physical punishment for some transgressions, but it would have been fine if we'd had a closer relationship.

As the youngest of three children, my brother (4.5 years older) was a bully growing up, and my sister, the oldest, would mostly protect me but that stopped when she went to college, when I was 10. I was born in 1990 and grew up with computers ... except that my brother was older so he'd keep me from learning how to use them properly. It pains me to think of all I could have learned to do if it wasn't for him. 

I went to a Catholic school (boys in one wing of the school and girls in the other wing) but I never took the school bus, so I hardly ever socialized with any girls. I barely even socialized with guys outside of school work. I didn't know half the girls in my own grade level, until 6 months before I graduated that school - which I went to for 9 years (some of the girls had also been there that long).

All of this to say, I am horrendously, painfully alone. And I have the perspective to know there are people who have it much worse, which just makes me feel worse about feeling sorry for myself, which kind of feeds into itself as you might imagine. I'm not in bad health (yet) ... if I exercised I could be in pretty great shape, but every time I try, my self-loathing kicks in and I give up fast. And I eat a lot of snacks, so I'm gaining weight.

Self-pity for being so alone, compounded with self-loathing because others have it worse, reinforced with more self-pity because I know my pain is real for me. And I can't talk to anyone about it because the response is always to try and diagnose. I've had a long time to myself to think about things and I have an idea of what would help me, but I can't actually say so or people will think I'm playing them for sympathy since I'm telling them the solution rather than letting them offer their own solutions.

I guess the easiest diagnosis would be depression, but it's just a symptom of my circumstances and general personal history, rather than actual clinical depression. The most likely diagnosis is emotional neglect and touch deprivation (or *skin hunger* as I've heard it called). I wouldn't mind going to a therapist, but it's not likely they can actually address the root of the matter (at least, not in this area. India is not well known for its mental health services).

And the kicker - I don't drink or smoke (or do any sort of drugs). My weak-ass coping mechanism is internet and food, and at one time I used to read a lot too. But now reading a story simply makes me think about the parts of the story I'm missing out on in real life, and depresses me.

Probably I could write more, but the gist is here. I am alone, I feel alone, I don't want to be alone, all the activities that people suggest to try to feel less alone, make me feel more alone because I'm doing them alone.

Also I have no idea what I want out of life. I wish I hadn't been born. Go figure.",15Apr2017,1
15,"So a few months ago I broke up with my High School girlfriend, and while it sounds stupid now, I really did love her. But she didn't love me back; she just had a crush. I think I subconsciously knew this months before the breakup, and it just kind of ate away at me. I became severely depressed, had suicidal thoughts, had disturbing dreams of being isolated and cut by nails. But most disturbing of all was my delusions of being hated by everyone and worthless. I became antisocial and would wander aimlessly, listening to one song on repeat over and over and over again.

By itself this sounds like depression instead of me being crazy, but of course there's more. It's been almost half a year since the break up, and to this day, every time I see any black jeep, no matter where the location or timing, I instantly think it's my old girlfriend's car until I rationalize the situation.

But the main thing I wanted to tell all of you is a story I was too scared to share with anyone close to me. After my breakup, I had a nasty argument with my ex girlfriend a few weeks later. Upon finishing it, I felt incredibly bad and decided to buy her a gift that night as a sort of peace offering I could give her the next day. On the way back from the store that night, I happened to pass by the movie theater and saw two people walking out towards the car. I thought one of them was my ex girlfriend, but I couldn't identify the other person. At first I thought it was their mother, but I realized the build was wrong, so I determined that it must be her best friend (who we will call Mary). I was struck with terror; she must have been telling all her friends (many of them good friends with me too) that I was an asshole! She had probably asked Mary to go to the movies for that very purpose.

I'm embarrassed to admit this because of how creepy it is, but I actually followed their car to a busy intersection to see which direction they would go. They went straight, which was the general area in which one of my ex girlfriend's other friends (who I'll call Lilah) lived. I instantly made the conclusion that my ex was going to Mary's house, even though I didn't know if Mary's house was in that direction. This was ridiculous because I didn't know where Mary lived even remotely; I had mixed her and Lilah up. Furthermore, it was 9:00 on a Sunday, so there was no reason they'd be hanging out that late when school was the next day.

All of this is to say that none of my actions or conclusions were at all rational. That night, I sent Mary a text and asked her for advice purely because I was worried that she had turned against me (she was my friend too). Viewing these actions in retrospect is to say, at the very least, frightening, because I know those people I saw at the movies WEREN'T my ex or Mary; that was an absurd conclusion. Many of these things, the depression, that incident, the paranoia towards jeeps, have no rational and seem delusional. If there's anything seriously wrong with me, I suspect it's triggered by pent up frustration and negative emotions. Or maybe this is just something that happens to everyone under stress? The answer terrifies me, but that's why I'm here. Thank you all in advance.",15Apr2017,1
16,"I think I am by and large, a normal person.  I've also started to realize that I react in a ""canned"" way to social interactions, despite the fact I act and feel ""normal"".

 
I recoil from touch.  I am emotionally distant.  I am hyper introspective, to the point I can't smoke pot without tearing myself apart in an unhealthy way, even if I take a single toke.

 
I obsess over the amount of time activities or actions will take to the point that I will become physically upset if something I estimated would take 15 minutes takes 17 minutes.  I recognize that I do this, and despite that, I will still become upset if I think someone has ""mismanaged"" my time.

I think much of it has to do with comparison to others, but on a deeper level, I think that our society is too divorced from nature as a whole.  To be with nature is to be reminded of one's place in the world. This isn't to say that I think we should all go live in the woods, but perhaps try to take the time to simply sit outside for a while and meditate if possible. There is research to suggest that being in nature can have positive psychological effects, too.  Speaking personally, I find myself most at peace when I can find the time or energy to go on a short walk and listen to the sounds of the woods.

I tend to isolate myself in my room, only leaving when strictly necessary. To put things into perspective, ive skipped meals because I dont want to have to interact with anybody. I take long detours to avoid crowds. I think this is some form of social anxiety, but I dont get panic attacks or anything serious. I can interact with people normally to some degree, and I can do presentations with no major issues usually.

I also identify with depression somewhat. Ive always had low energy levels, and I go to sleep everyday hoping I dont wake up. But at the same time, I know id never be able to kill myself because im a coward. Everytime I dial the suicide hotline I just feel like an attention-seeking jackass. I dont feel particularly sad most of the time, I just feel...empty. I avoid the world by watching reruns of shows ive watched multiple times, just staring for hours with no emotion.

39,"Okay, first off I have been formally diagnosed with anxiety and depression and I am not on any medication as such.
It's also come to light in the last 6 months that I have PCOS.

Basically I have been suicidal since I was 6.
I didn't know what that was at the time but I remember being incredibly sad and wishing that I just wouldn't wake up in a morning. 

I was a difficult child. Behavioural issues and didn't exactly fit in. Didn't have many friends and got bullied.

By the time I was 18 I had gone through counselling, self help , taken my self out of the abusive situation I had found myself in and yet I still found myself suicidal.
At this point I made my first (and currently only) serious attempt.

This was following what felt like the end of the world and it had been building up for a long, long time.
I believed I had demons in my house. I was hallucinating, restricted my eating and drinking to the point I stopped altogether for long enough that bodily functions stopped.
I didn't wash I didn't leave my room.

There was no help. No sympathy and I was let home on the promise to not do it again.
I've regretted calling the ambulance every day since and that was 8 years ago.
I had backed out as I had the sudden realisation that my friend would be the one to find me and he didn't come home often so there would be some level of decomposition involved.
Turns out it would have been three days as I came home the same time he did.

I've literally had doctors tell me it's just pms or act like it's an attention thing.
I find the less severe attributes to this are a severe fear of abandonment. Suspicious of others intentions (in fears of boyfriend cheating or colleague settings me up or making a joke of me without me knowing) 
My feelings towards others are very off and on. 
Again for example I love my boyfriend dearly but the second I think that things are going downhill I shut down completely waiting for him to leave.

I binge eat and compulsively bite the skin around my fingers and mouth I have issues sleeping in that it's either 4 hours or 12. 
I am either walking around numb, in a pit of tar or I'm away with the fairies and can't concentrate to save my life.
I have never really engaged in risky behaviour but I have used my boyfriend for physical affection when I didn't feel like there was enough emotional affection being given to me.
And while I am no where near an alcoholic I do find drinking does one of two things. Makes me fizzy enough to it care or helps it come to the surface and I can just let it out.

I'm just at my wits end.

40,"So I have this sister that is diagnosed with autism but undiagnosed with schizophrenia and OCD. Both seem to have appeared around 3 or 4 years ago (and they may just be the same condition), but it took my mother a while to finally accept her conditions and move on.

So we tried taking her to an income-based clinic that offered her a session with a psychologist for $35. We went in, my sister ranted about gangstalking and the lizards, and the professional thought we just wanted ritalin for her (this clinic is often used for ADHD prescriptions). That's not we want.

I want my sister to be properly evaluated by a psychologist(or maybe a psychiatrist) and to begin the process of diagnosis. That means building a psychological profile, having a variety of tests, and what other means necessary to finally reach a point of proper anti-psychotic prescription and psychological treatment.

What do I ask for this? Where do I go to? How can we get this done? My mother literally cannot study with my sister having these breakdowns and I fear a lot for my sister's well being and happiness. A big issue is that we just don't have the money, my mother has no job, I'm studying for graduate school, and the little money we do get is from our deceased father's social security. My sister, being 20 now, needs help, but we can't figure out the low-cost or free services to go to for said help.

What do we do?

EDIT: While the government in rural Virginia doesn't provide much info concerning help, at least the local police department knows how to deal with my sister. Every minute of every day she has the phone in her hand, repeatedly dialing 911 and then cancelling out the number selection, and will threaten, several times a day, to call the police if I do something as simple as knock on her door. She calls them on a semi-regular basis and vents on them (i.e. saying I'm an abuser and that I hit her and other bizarre claims such as that the birds are colluding against her) but they never institutionalize her or take anyone away. They seem to understand her situation by this point.

But my big fear is that one day the emergency response may be more extreme. Maybe she freaks out in a violent fashion or maybe a situation escalates into something that the police should not ignore. We'd prefer not to have her dragged away into a group home before we can at least try to have her psychologically treated with my mother maintaining custody.",15Apr2017,8

The first several times it happened, I got up and walked to where my iPod dock is in my house to check that it wasn't left on. I only realised then that the music had no source, and in that second, the music stopped. I turned around to go back to bed again, and the music started again.

My mum died about 4 months ago, and she was sick in hospital for a month before that. I stayed with her every day to take care for her, and slept on the floor next to her at night. Around that time, I started to hear the music at times other than when I was in bed. I heard one particular song when I was in hospital with her, which I later heard also when I was with my friend a couple of months ago. I started to hear it in the gym a few days ago, as a guy was playing his music aloud, but as I went closer to him, I realised he was listening to a rap song, and not my one - but still the music carried on and got louder.



When I got into the car with the person I went to the gym with, the song came on in their car on the CD. I had no idea they even knew it and it is an uncommon song. I looked up the artist and it turns out he was born in the same small town as me, with less than 10,000 people, and the odds are just so incredibly low it feels terrifying - I'm sure this is some way for my mum to try and communicate with me and I'm just not sure how, I've tried looking in the lyrics to understand more deeply but I can't - I get panicky when I put on the song now and hear it every single night when I'm in bed, I'm hearing it now

45,"I always look at what I could be doing or what other people are doing all the time and wishing I was them or doing what they were doing, but I can't because my social anxiety is so bad. I feel like I am just living but not doing anything because if I want to do something, my anxiety holds me back. All I do is compare myself to other people living their lives to the fullest while I just lay around all day, hiding from the world. I am never going to live until I push myself to do the things I want. How do I stop letting my anxiety control my life?",15Apr2017,18
