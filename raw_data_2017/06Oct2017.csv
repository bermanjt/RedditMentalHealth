So i can be a very anxious and paranoid individual. Ill just give you an example of something that happened today. I was driving home from school and i get a phone call. I answer it, as i always do, its a marine OSO. I had given my info earlier that year because i wanted to join the marines through the nrotc. I still kind of want to join the marines because it would prepare me for what i want to do in the future (if i do indeed join the marines) but it would also help improve myself. So anyway i answer its an OSO and i just panic. I begin sweating a lot i feel like im going to throwup and my rntire reality around me begins to blur, becoming surreal and unobtainable. I of course continue to talk to the man. I talk in a confident voice answering all his questions and just having an excellent back and forth conversation. But like i said underneath all that confidence im nearly suicidal. This happens constantly sometimes ever wothout the presence of a trigger (i guess thats what its called). Im just wondering what this is. Why do i panic even when i know there no reason to? And why does the world seem so fake and strange during this? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. I should mention that on occasion other mental things can happen and i feel unstable at times. There is no short way for saying one or all of them so i just wont try. ",06Oct2017,1,
1,"To the girl who just held the door open for me as I entered the library.....

You will never know how much that means to me, today is the first day I have left my apartment this week. Your kindness and smile mean the world to me, it was a reminder to me that people do care and that I am not some invisible person floating through a possible purgatory. The little things really can have a huge affect on someone. Thank you, thank you so much.",06Oct2017,18,
2,"This may be long. I don't even know where to begin. I was institutionalized back in May after a bad experience with alcohol,but honestly, I've felt myself going downhill for awhile. I'd go and get help, and then stop going after three sessions. They've been all over the place with a diagnosis. While in the hospital, they said I had major depression with possibility of borderline or bipolar. And then they suggested possibly being adhd. I just don't now. I feel like my brain is a contingency of thoughts that are broken apart, like my brain is one of those money boxes in which you try and catch the dollar bills that fly out at you. I feel like life is so beautiful that I am just so in awe. I feel like I can do anything, but i don't actually try to do it. I do it all in my head. I have all these great ideas and tell everyone about them. I start writing screenplays, I research things. I'm all in. Or I am so depressed that it physically hurts and makes me sick. But perhaps the worst part is the apathy. The world turns gray and my brain doesn't make sense it's like it shuts off.
  And then I feel like I have different personas. There is the me who is childlike and full of awe and excited. Shes a dreamer and has so much love to give. And then there is the version of myself who is cold and mysterious, who doesn't care and is effortless. And then there's a side of myself who is seething and who is absolutely disgusted by human beings. I also feel like each persona has a different appearance. Ican't articulate my thoughts i don't know",06Oct2017,2,
3,I think i need some serious help. As a kid I had a VERY traumatic childhood. I’ve never talked about it with anyone and I’ve basically bottled it up for 23 years. Suddenly I’ve been feeling very anxious for example I constantly think im dying like my body is trying to destroy me to the point where im convinced im dying. I also have a weird pain on my side which the doctors think its costrochronditis but i feel like it only really appears if my mind starts wondering i get anxious i have often thought of suicide or ill daydream really bad things happening to me basically i feel really fucked up and i dont know what to do about it... i have no insurance so i feel like i have no options.,06Oct2017,2,
4,"My mom has some unknown mental issue. Growing up she would hit me and yell at me and pull my hair. I've forgiven her, as my dad was really not good to her and she was stressed and sad. She's a good friend of mine now but sometimes it's hard to get over the memories of her hitting me. She doesn't think it's wrong, but feels bad that she's caused me pain",06Oct2017,2,
5,"Im a freshman in college and I also work part time at a grocery store. I don't mind either of these things, and Im honestly glad I made it to a point in my life where i have something going on for me.

My home life is extremely stressful due to multiple reasons, so that stacked with general school and work stress has thrown me into a large depressive episode. The last time I remember feeling this bad was when I was hospitalized.
I've tried speaking to the counsolers available on my campus, and they all said that i need to seek help from a psychiatrist. My issue is that i dont have the time to do that. I cant afford to miss school or work, but whenever I go home i end up back in the same depressed mood.
If i did even have time to see a psychiatrist im worried I'll be hospitalized again, and that's really the last thing I need right now.

What can I do? Im not sure how to take care of myself without interfering with the rest of my life.",06Oct2017,2,

7,"My psychiatrist is really mean to me. I take some alternative medicine and she taunts me about it, saying stuff like ""What are you wasting your money on this time?"" or ""How's your micro amount of medicine helping?"" and it's really frustrating because I take 800mg a day and she calls it micrograms and it really really helps my symptoms but she refuses to accept that. She thinks I'm just making it up 'to get off my meds'. She also asks me trick questions like, ""Do you feel happy or sad today."" and I just feel normal. I feel like she's making things up because she says stuff like, ""Are you still taking just the Lions Mane?"" But I switched from Lions Mane to an extract half a year ago and she doesn't remember this, even though she took notes? She says she's not allowed to reduce my doseage even though I look online and people do get prescribed lower amounts. Unfortunately there's not other psychiatrists in town, what can I do?",06Oct2017,3,

12,"Really hoping I've put this under the correct tag. My apologies if not. Anyway-- About a week or two ago I visited the doctor. Originally, I was visiting about a place on my arm but decided to speak about my on going depression. The doctor gave me a paper evaluation and had me fill it out. With that, she asked me questions and diagnosed me with severe depression. She asked me a set of questions. Two of the questions were: have you thought about killing yourself? And if so, do you have a plan? I proceeded to say yes for the first one and no to the second question. The second one was- of course- a lie. I was quite worried that if she actually believed that I had the means or idea of killing myself she would either call one of my family members (I'm 18 and unsure as to whether or not she could disclose that information. I know I have the rights to privacy but not so sure about it if she thought I was a threat to myself) or she would have me hospitalized. I wanted some input on this: would she attempt to speak with someone I live with or try to hospitalize me if I told her the truth about my plans?  I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read this. Thank you. ",06Oct2017,2,
13,"I'm a very ambitious and determined person, and I've accomplished a TON of amazing things in my life, especially given my young age. Accomplishing things gives me a great rush of a big ego as the people around me tell me how proud they are and are very surprised by my great success. However, this feeling is extremely short lived, and before I know it, I feel restless and eager to accomplish even more. This causes me a great deal of anxiety and often suicidal thoughts because I feel like I'll either A) come face to face with failure and will feel extremely horrible about myself or B) will never feel satisfied with my life and will always be searching for something better.

I think this also has something to do with the fact that I got into my dream college during my senior year of high school, but wasn't able to go because of financial restrictions. That was a huge blow/""failure,"" and I feel like now I'm working five times as hard to ""redeem"" myself, and somehow never face failure like that again. 

I just wish I could slow things down or escape this persisting feeling of inferiority...",06Oct2017,1,

19,"I am 20 years old, female, living in seattle, usa. and I have been diagnosed with depression and potential bipolar disorder (dismissed tho). If I am just with myself, I am a cool, happy, free, wild person. I am successful academically, and professionally. But my personal life SUCKS. I grow up with my dad always unavailable since my parents got divorced and I was the one who found out he was cheating. When I grow up and go out there dating, I realize I have a tendency to be really to a certain type 1)muscular, tall, good looking 2)engineer 3)with mental or emotional problem. Basically, I am looking for someone that reminds me of my father. And whatever that person I am with has, I will start to have it, too. And the latest one I was with always seems to be in his own thoughts, dumped me, said hes not available, gets bored easily. Now I have been feeling not well for a while. I started to have episodes of detachment, or depersonalization. I can't wrap my head around things, too and I dont know what the fuck I am doing most of the day. I don't feel hungry, I don't feel sad nor happy. I wake up in the morning being confused and feeling detached, not feeling anything but when I get connected back to reality, it was a tremendous amount of pain. I would cry for an hour, my chest hurts, and I cant eat well. 
Truth is I was deep in love with the guy that dumped me. He has issues and i know full well but I miss him like crazy. It's the poison in him that I crave. He didnt pay attention or cared for me at all, but I was dying for it. 

Then I went out a date with someone else, only to find myself not able to focus and I said the same thing the guy said to me: ""I'm emotionally unavailable"". This is not the first time something like this happens and it's why I suspect the ex was having depersonalization issues.

I dont know, I feel like a mirror. and when i have feelings for someone, their personality and their problems will be reflected on me. This time, I feel like I'm somewhere between reality and somewhere else very uncomfy,

To be honest, redditors, I am writing this with my mind not really working well the way it usually does. I don't know if this makes sense, but i'd really appreciate some suggestions. ",06Oct2017,4,

30,"I need some help. I'm anxious about writing this. I believe it will sound 'pathetic'. I've had an intense belief that, if given the chance, people will think poorly of me, for a long time. Sometimes I get good at fighting it, at thinking in new ways. I think I fucked up, none of the same stuff helps me through anymore. I can only rely on things that numb me. Food, tv. It's an extremely boring life. I realise I must be very sad and lonely but I can't feel it. It's like there's a veil between me and the world. Maybe it's my SSRI's? Low dose lexapro, 5 mg for a year now. I'm terrified of people hurting me emotionally, I get so nervous talking to anyone about anything important 1 on 1. I feel trapped, caged. I wish I could just be sad or angry but I don't know how to get there. I'm always trying to treat people in the best possible way but only so they will like me. I hate being alone, my thoughts are the worst companions. But my thoughts get worse when I'm around people for too long. I start to feel irritated because I believe they are thinking poorly of me, or if it is my partner I might feel very needy. I hate that I am like this. I've never felt so lost in my life.
My day to day is just trying to ignore how empty and bored and lonely I feel. I'm so lonely but I get so irritated at everyone around me. I think about dying every day. It wouldn't be fair though. I can't bear the thought of people feeling angry at me, even if I was dead.
My best friend started seeing my ex recently who was (I think?) emotionally abusive to me (out of ignorance not maliciously) whilst I wasn't talking to the best friend as they told me that the two of them kissed. I thought my friend would prioritize me but they didn't. I thought they understood.
I don't think I can trust people as much as I need to, in order to open up in the way that I (assume I) need. Being a true friend to someone, in my books, is as intimate as a partner emotionally. But I don't even know if I am that good so how can I expect it from anyone else?
I'm very tired. Being awake is a constant struggle. I feel bad to burden anyone, or I don't trust them enough to.
I don't know what to do. The safest and easiest option that won't harm anyone is just to live my life as a mindless emotionless zombie. I need to have meaning and purpose in my life, otherwise I might just impulsively take all my medication (I've come close) which I know probably wouldn't even kill me.
I'm seeing a therapist, I have a job and a comfortable amount of money and a car. I'm 23 and I live in Australia. I'm very intelligent, perceptible and radical in a lot of ways. It's not easy for me to make friends even though people always seem impressed (I wear strange clothes etc). I struggle with emotional eating. I spend most of my time alone in my room. I struggle with my image. 
I had an old therapist who I saw for about a year tell me I didn't need him anymore.
My mum died when I was 18.

I feel like I need to justify how bad I feel. Idk.

There are good things too. I have a great partner. I have some really sensitive and intelligent friends. My family isn't the worst.

I just feel like life is drudgery and mindless consumerism. And when I want to do something about it I lean toward impulsivity and feel-good things because I don't want to try some long term change and for it to not get better...

So I went to the counselor, and by the 5th visit, she had me fill out some exam forms, to see what other things I might have going on.

I never got the results. She looked concerned, then stopped all appointments.

Finally started seeing someone after a laundry list of abusive mental health profesionals (to the point of sexual assult and conversion therapy).

This one basically told me to contact her between sessions. This seems really unprofessional, I wouldnt call my PCP off hours, or my boss.
