0,"I have decided to be more truthful with my psychiatrist. I have written in a journal all of the things I have left out, distorted or skimmed over that are needed for a more complete diagnosis. That being said, reading over what was written has made me realize I have done quite a few things that I would rather keep secret. I know hiding things from your therapist should be a nono but holy shit it is making me nervous that I have to spill my guts to someone finally. Do I bring up thefts or will that land me in trouble? Do I need to mention using sex to get money from ""friends,"" because that feels awkward. Drug abuse? Some of the angry moments I had with my dog both growing up and the one I now own are not something I want to talk about with someone, let alone my roommate's cat. Nothing crazy but I know it was inappropriate. Is it necessary for him to know things about my sex life? He knows of the personalities/histories/stories I created at each location I moved to. He knows quite a bit more but.... does he need to know about my childhood at all? Or will he ask if he needs to know?
 I have everything written out and I am prepared to bring the journal in but holy hell I would rather not if not necessary :/",10May2017,2
1,"So we went to family counseling (I'm 15). And the counselor started talking to all of us about what we'd like to see. And I said something about how I feel like Mom picks on me a lot and says hurtful things but I'm expected not to respond, and she tells me to ""use my words"" and come talk to her but then she gets mad at me if I do. Anyways, once we were out of the counselors office, mom laid into me and started going off at me for ""lying to the counselor"" and ""making things up to make her look bad"" and stuff like that.  She yelled the whole way home and then said I couldn't go to my friend's party because of how I behaved.

I'd really like this counseling to work, but I'm afraid it won't if I'm getting in trouble for what I say. I'd like for us all to get along but I'm worried Mom just sees it as a way to ""fix"" me. I know I need help but I'm afraid I won't be able to get it with my mom interfering this much.  Is there anything I can do?",10May2017,3
2,"Sorry for the wall of text. But if you decide to read it all thank you. 

So a little background on me. I'm 25 years old and I'm sad. Not just the normal kind of sad but the kind of sad that sucks the color out of everything in life. I can't really get happy. All my emotions are dulled. My best friend died a few years ago and it didn't really phase me.

I've been through some rough things. When I was young I was raped by an older cousin and this caused me to lose my religion. I was also in the military serving as a mortician. The thing is, while these things made me worse and attempt suicide they weren't the start of it.

I have a very bad memory for my childhood, I tend to forget most long term memories including highschool. My good recall only extends about 3 or 4 years in the past.  I personally think it is because my apathy has caused me to go through life on auto pilot. My mom assures me I was a happy young child but somewhere along the way that changed.

From around 8 I have been practicing escapism. I would lose myself in 600 page books and later many hours of videogames pretending I was someone else. Up through highschool and early college these books and games were my closest friends. I set a record in my highschool for reading 300+ books in a school year.

I'm smart. Even with my apathy I managed a 3.6 gpa in highschool and test scores high enough to get a full ride scholarship in college. 

I have the ability to be anything I want but I don't want anything besides not being me. I feel like a failure and that I am just wasted potential. In fact I know it. I hear it every time I talk to my parents. I've been in and out of college but can never manage to do more than two years at a time before I can't leave my apartment anymore.

I can't maintain friendships and even though by some miracle I have managed to have a couple girlfriends in the past few years the relationships imploded. 

I've been in a psych ward. I have done outpatient counciling. I have been medicated and not medicated. I tried going to the VA a couple months back but after being turfed to 3 seperate specialists with no actual counciling or help I ran out of motivation. 

What do I do? What can I do? I have no passions to follow. I have no dreams. I rarely ever feel happiness and when I do it is fleeting. I could be a millionaire and not spend a dime because I don't want anything.",10May2017,1
3,"To a point, I feel like I've always had a level of anxiety. Ive always felt like I'm really stupid, and in turn make easy tasks hard for myself by getting myself flustered and worked up. As I've gotten older it's irritated me more and more, and has caused a huge drop in my overall confidence and I tend to shy away from doing certain things just to avoid the potential embarrassment or humiliation. 

When I talk of the fear that I feel, I feel as if it's a very odd, silly, and unique situation. I've noticed that I've suffered with this problem more over the last year/year and a half. I think it may be important for me to point out that I lost my Nan of whom I was very close with, she passed away last April. What I tend to do is think back to times in the past where I may have had some kind of confrontation with someone. At the time these problems didn't eat me alive nearly as much as they have a few years after they happened I must add, which is why I find all of this so odd. It's then like my brain will convince me that the problems I had with these people in the past are still active today, despite all of the 'problems' being sorted on the spot in the past, or just forgotten about &amp; keeping ourselves to ourselves etc. 

It's literally like these problems follow each other up one after the other. Whenever I'm just about able to shake something I thought of off, something else from the past will then pop up and cause me distress. This distress in most cases has lasted for months on end, where in some cases I've had to message the person/people to again clear things up just to convince myself that everything's okay. In every case, we've been able to laugh things off and laugh at the fact that I'm even asking them if things are cool. 

These problems, although minor in all cases, have caused me some pretty severe distress as I said. I'm filled with so much worry and anxiety it seems that I find it hard to go about my life normally and doing normal things. I pretty much hide away on my own in my bedroom, find it hard to socialise and speak to my family, and generally just feel crappy about myself and my life each day when I understand fully that things could be a lot worse. 

*i should also add that even when talking to friends or anyone, I tend to really focus on what I say and a lot of the time feel like I may have said something that could have caused offence. I have a similar issue also where I feel like I may have looked at somebody in the wrong way when outside or something, even though I may not have at all I will still almost convince myself that I have and again, drive myself insane with worry.

Anybody able to relate to this in any way? Thanks. ",10May2017,1
4,"Hey Reddit.

21/M here. Diagnosed: GAD, OCD, Panic Disorder and Depression.

I'm introverted as fuck. Super awkward, and when I do talk to people, I have horrible anxiety. I was bullied through all of middle and high school severely. My OCD usually revolves around my general/mental health. Went through a period were I was convinced I was developing schizophrenia.

Currently on 5mg prozac, 100mg lamictal and 10mg of dexedrine.

Anyways, for a while now I've realized I do some really weird, stupid shit. Often times I would make a reddit post, then reply to myself with two different accounts with two opposite opinions. I'm fully aware its me I am replying too, but would reply with different posting styles asif I was not. I would justify this (internally) by saying it both helped me sort through my thoughts, and helped facilitate  conversation on both sides of a topic.

Anyways, a friend found my Reddit account. Sat me down, told me I was sick, need help, and that this is not normal to be replying to myself. Now I'm once again concerned I am going to loose my sanity

Other weird shit I've done:

Super mad about circumsision

Hid a raspberry pi in a powerstrip as a prank with the SSID ""FuckDJT""

Lie about random, stupid  things for no reason, at no benefit and even determent to myself. I.E. ""I had pizza for lunch"" when I really had Chinese. I usually say this automatically without thinking about it. Recently I've been working really hard to catch it and will say ""wait thats not true"" if I notice it. I don't lie about serious stuff/meaningful stuff.

Thought I had a brain tumor.

Feel guilty about litterally everything. I feel like I am a terrible person. When people tell me otherwise, or say they love me or like hanging out with me, I dismiss it, because I know I'm a piece of shit. (Irrational I know). I justify this by remembering how much of a shithead I was in high school. 

Fuck, I'm noticing even now, as I write this. I'm formulating a response to myself, like an itch. After I post it I feel better, like I sorted through my problem and sometimes I make myself feel better by trying to tell myself this is probably what other people think in relation to the comment I made to myself.  I'm really hoping this is some sort of OCD thing and not psychosis/delusions/whatever",10May2017,1

6,"Update: my jewelry is not sharp. I have to double (two in each ear)  stretched lobes with thin slilcone tunnels, a small nose stud with the sharp end clipped, then a navel and captive rings that I have to go to the piercer to have changed cuz they're so tight, small and hard to remove. Also my siblings, friends and I have been through the system and been treated very poorly. No hospital near me is highly rated. My opinion on psych nurses are based on experience not prejudgement and I haven't been deemed incompetent nor do I self harm.

I have 9 piercings (6 in my ears, 1 in my nose, 1 in my lip and 1 in my belly button) if they make me take them out (most hospitials near me do) and I refuse, can they hold me down and rip them out? What will happen? The last time I was hospitalized I only had 3 and I can't remember if I had to take them out or not. It was 3 and a half years ago. They mean a lot to me.

7,"I'm depressed/bored and don't know what to do about it. I'm 26 (female) and have been this way for the majority of my life. 

Firstly I can't stick ANY job. I've had 12 jobs since graduating. In 10 days time I will be starting job number 13. I find every job unbearable to the point I cry in the bathroom, and pray to God for help. I'm unhappy in every area of life and feel what's the point in working? I'm basically working to pay bills for a meaningless life. 

I feel very lonely. Up until the age of 18 I was bullied. This left me with NO social life. The bullying stopped when I went to university but this left me rather mentally damaged so I didn't make any friends. I eventually had a breakdown and was admitted to therapy for suicidal depression. 

Eventually I started to get better. At 25 I went travelling for a year. Naive and a virgin I was taken advantage of. I still think about that night, and it upset me deeply. I eventually made 'friends' but still depressed I started experimenting with drugs. I stopped this when I met my first ever boyfriend. The one time in my life I can say I was actually happy. Our relationship didn't last, as he turned out to be a cruel manipulative individual. 

Now I'm back home I'm depressed, frustrated and very lonely. I spend nearly everyday of my life alone. When it gets too much I travel home on the weekends to spend it with my family. I have one friend (who I am grateful for) but I only see her twice a month. My life consists of work, browsing the internet, gym and going for walks alone in the park. 

I'm so sad, I'm crying as I write this. I don't know what to do. I've considered going travelling again? Moving to another country? Going back to university to retrain? 

Any advice would be much appreciated...",10May2017,10

11,"Hey, seems like someone in this subreddit might have had similar issues, and maybe could give me advice? 

When I was a young kid I used to have some serious issues with how often I touched things. I would flip light switches for like a minute at a time, and would consciously touch things with my left then right hand, like opening a door with my left hand and then closing it with my right ect... 

I did this because I had to make sure things felt just ""right"". I think it stemmed from my schooling, as all through school I would able to miss like a month of school to play games, while still maintaining high grades. This wasn't from hard work or anything, it was just how I was born. I was always scared that if I didn't do this I could just wake up one day and just start failing (I know it's irritational, but I was young). 

Anyways this goes on for years, no biggie. Maybe a couple moments standing there trying to do lights, or my new thing was stepping perfectly with my feet avoiding the cracks on tile floors. Somehow it just got really bad though. I would consistently spend 30 to 40 minutes trying to get the right feel for things, and then if my very next step was on a crack, or I touched a door handle the wrong way, I could have to redo it over again. This went on until I basically broke down, I realised that whatever the consequence for it not feeling right was, it couldn't be worse than doing this. 

After adopting this mentality, thing started to get alot better. If I touched something the wrong way, I would just say fuck it and move on, and eventually I realised nothing bad would really happen. And so I've been going strong with no issues whatsoever for a year and a half now. 

So my question is about seeking additional treatment. I think I'm really good with dealing with it right now. But I've started to think of it as a kinda pit that these urges come from. I'm really good with dealing with the urges, but no matter how good I get, I still get the same amount of urges. For example if I'm using the sink, and I get the urge to turn the left handle with my left hand, and the similar thing with my right, I can easily say fuck it and just open the left one with my left, left with my right, or any combination. Yet, even if I'm pretty good with fixing the urge, I still get the urge and have to spend time thinking about how I'm going to use a frigen sink.

I get lightheaded when moving my head around/when walking in my house and getting lots of urges. In the mornings when I get alot of these urges sometimes it messes with me. 

Anyways the point of all this, is that I'm considering medication. My life is great right now, and like I said, I don't have any serious issues dealing with the urges, and therefore I don't think therapy could be very helpful. Yet with the sink thing, The point is that as I walk around, my brain constantly thinks differently, giving me prompts on how I should touch the sink or door knobs. I just don't think about them and say fuck it. But I'm wondering if medication will give me less prompts per say, and therfore maybe help with the lightheadedness. Has anyone with similar issues successfully suppressing heir brain from thinking these urges as often? Should I see someone about medication and diagnosis? Im in school so Im kinda warry about medicine, but also want to try it if you guys think it could help. 

Also I live in Canada, so no worries about cost or doctors trying to get you hooked, if that's important to anyone's advice.",11May2017,2

14,"Do you ever find yourself getting caught in a train of thought where your life turns to shit for whatever reason? (Namely the imminent yet unexpected death of a loved one but that can be flexible because everyone's situation is different.) I'm bipolar 2 so the anxiety is real, and painful. 

I sometimes find myself trapped for up to 10 minutes at a time before I can snap out of it - 10 minutes being a long ass time inside your own head - and it usually has to deal with the death of my S/O. Having lost my parents a year apart, the concept isn't foreign to me. 

It's almost like my mind is preparing itself to deal if that happens by somewhere pretending it's already happened. My brain wants to stage the scene and mark time and practice to protect itself. This ideation happened frequently in my last long-term relationship, and now that my current relationship is at ""that level"" of serious I guess my brain is like, ""Okay, time to prep for the impending doom because you care so damn much.""

So I was curious what other people's brains do to them that might be similar to this - and what you do (or don't do) about it. ",11May2017,3
15,"Before I begin, I'm new to reddit, so if I do something wrong, let me know because otherwise I won't have a clue. I'm sorry for all of my upcoming grammar and spelling mistakes. I also tend to ramble a lot, so be warned.
I really don't know if I need advice, an explanation, if I need to talk to someone or what I need to do. I don't even know if this is the right place, but I might as well try. I'm not really comfortable sharing my location publicly, but I don't think that will be necessary. Same with age, I can say that I'm under the age of 20. 
That's enough rambling/disclaimers already, I'm sorry, I'm going to move on to my problem. 
It's about overthinking and trust. Or at least mostly. It started with me having trouble trusting a friend. It wasn't that bad, for example, I had a hard time believing them when they said stuff like ""I'm fine, don't worry"" 
That's normal, I think at least, anyway, it escalated, first slowly, and then the pace went up. It escalated to me having to go with a friend if they were going to get something real quick, for example if they were getting a glass of water, or a pen, since I didn't trust that they would come back to me. I felt like it was an excuse to get away from me. I stopped trusting them while they were sitting with me as well, it's a known fact in my group that you don't touch my things without me giving permission, cause I don't trust people enough to believe that they won't fuck up. If I am walking in public, I don't trust that people will be able to be careful enough to not hurt me if they bump into me. If I ask for response, I don't trust that the person giving response will give me a honest answer. I also don't trust their judgement. Or the fact that they will accept a mistake or two, because I get the feeling that they will only look down on me. 
To put it a bit more simply, I think most people have heard this classic:
*An insult is no insult until you take it to heart, words can only affect you when you allow them to.*
What people don't realize is that this works both ways. However much I would love to believe someone when they tell me not to worry, or that they will be back, I can't help but overthink it. I don't have a hard time talking about problems with people, or talking at all, unless it's a new person, but that's for different reasons. My problem is to trust them. 
I don't know what is wrong with me. Maybe I'm just overthinking a problem. I've been aware of this for a long time, but haven't thought much of it, until today. Because today was the day I realized that I truly trust no one. The last person I thought I trusted showed me that. I don't even know if I trust myself.
**So why write all of this? Why go through the trouble? I mean, you must trust the community to not judge you if you choose to post this here. Right?**
Honestly, I don't believe anyone will bother or care, I don't trust that, in a way. The reason is that whoever is reading this will most likely not know me. And if by a chance the person actually knows me, knowing that it is me is also not likely. Since I don't know who you are and you probably don't know who I am, I don't expect anything from you. I focus on the advice and the text itself, instead of focusing on what's going on in the person behind it. That is, if said person even read this through and reply. I appreciate advice, since another point of view can be healthy. That sounds very contradicting and hypocritical. I also don't really care if the person behind the other monitor judges me since it won't affect me in real life. But as I said, I appreciate advice and I will gladly answer questions I am comfortable answering. Regardless, it was nice to get it all out. If you read it all, thank you for putting up with me.",11May2017,3

19,"I am a single parent of 2 children, and 1 year ago, my stepdaughter (stepdaughter from when I was still married to her mother) was put into the foster care system because her mom was found to be incapable of taking care of her (at 15/16yo.)

After a year of back and forth relapsing on IV heroin, my 17yo daughter ""Amy"" relapsed and ran out of money. This was around December 2016.
She went missing December 28th and was gone for nearly 3 weeks.
She had been forced into walking streets, backpage escort ads etc because she was out of money and was so dopesick / no resources. 
I ended up tracking her down 3 weeks later to a home where she was being kept, called the FBI task force that was in charge of her search, and they alerted the local police.
2 hours later, she was on the way to the ER. 

She was in bed with the guy supplying her, who was also keeping her from leaving. She had just turned 17 at this point, and he was somewhere around 63-65yo, which is older than both of her grandfathers.

Fast forward to now.
I am a 2yo veteren of Iraq with the Marines, private security, and have gone through a lot in my life but I was not prepared nor could I prepare for this. 

This affected me more than anything I have ever gone through.

I dont even know what to ask for. Support groups? What kinds? 
What kind of counsellor? 

I took a sympathetic shock / parasympathetic shock / ptsd questionaire and nearly maxed all of them out.

I am completely emotionally detached, can barely function in life, and just want a way to get better.

I've been diagnosed (over the past three years mainly) with anxiety, depression, insomnia, gender dyshoria and anorexia and ptsd to go with it. I've had two suicide attempts to date and self harm regularly, in the past I did turn to reckless sexual activity and just risky behaviour... my abandonment issues first lead to my break up with my only and last boyfriend... been two years but I'm okay with the single life yet being with someone else to cuddle and hang out with would be nice... lately I Haven't been to school due to hardly being able to cope with everything, most of my days I spend inside watching doctor who, supernatural and or the magicians... also YouTube channels for gaming and computer parts and tech...

1. im  attached to a heart monitor for a month ( causing anxiety over heart health and damaging the darn thing and the sensory issues from being attached to a monitor and wires)
2. i started physical therapy a couple weeks ago which means people I don't know trust are touching me, talking to me etc, stress over health causing that, stress over cost of the copays. And it's new and change is horrid. 

3. i have a sleep study tonight which means I'll be away from my cat for 12+ hours and away from home. it's been more than a year since that happened and the anxiety monster in me is telling me there is going to be a fire, a hurricane, a tornado, a blizzard and a burglar all at once. and my cat will injure himself spill his food and water and drown. be terribly lonely and hate me. plus sensory and health worries. plus past hospital trauma. 

4. my therapist just got back from getting married and the last time I had a therapist get married they changed in a bad way. also both leaving and coming back is change and change is bad. her hair is also a slightly different color. and one of the receptionists at the office left and one is new. 

5. an art therapy group I was in ended recently. and I got to talk to this person there who I have a crush on. but also change. and less art. and less therapy.

6 one of the other therapists in the office I have a giant crush on and although she's not my therapist even if I would have had a chance with her in other circumstances which honestly is unlikely because she's awesome and gorgeous and recently single...but because she works there and I go there although we hang out and talk often when she's not busy and I think/ hope she at least doesn't hate me. i can't even really be her friend. 

7. i recently started trauma therapy which not only means trying to trust someone else, change, the fact that I used to be kinda friends with her and person from #6, and ya know processing trauma. but it also means I only see my regular therapist once a week instead of twice. and this therapist is close to me in age and Everytime I see her I feel shitty that I'm not in the same place as her like all my plans had me being...

8. there are a few other things but those are the main ones I think...other than all of my emotions I've been coping with by pushing down for a couple years have filled that space and are now beginning to leak/ explode.


9. oh and med changes

so yeah.  I'm having multiple panic attacks a day. flashbacks from things that either didn't cause them before or stopped causing them. tired all the time but can't sleep. when I do sleep nightmares I wake from flailing about and terrified to go back to sleep. general anxiety and depression probably doubled. suicidal thoughts increased. wanting to cut more/ deeper. eating disorder urges increased. and wanting strongly to misuse my meds and to drink in a rather unhealthy way. and increased hypervigilance, trust issues and startle responce. so yeah...

36,"Hi Reddit - I recently started going to therapy again for anxiety and decided to blog about it to share what it's like to actually go through it on Medium.

Here is the first post: https://medium.com/kip-blog/founder-therapy-for-the-therapy-founder-c685d56204

I'd love your feedback. For people who haven't been to therapy – what are you curious about? What questions do you have about therapy? What do you find weird about therapy or confusing? If you have been to therapy, is there anything you are curious about or think is important to cover?

I've been to 7 sessions so far and am working on managing anxiety and stress. The person I go to uses a CBT and strengths-based approach. What I do is, I record the sessions (so I can focus fully on treatment when I'm with my therapist) and now that I've reduced symptoms and feel good about it – I'm going through the recordings one by one and sharing what happened. 

Disclaimer: I am the founder of a therapy startup, Kip, and am using my service, so you will see references to that in the post, especially the first one. The irony here is that stress from work triggered my anxiety (hah!). ",11May2017,2
