0,"I don't know how many of you read it, but a few weeks ago I made a post about something that happened to me.  For those of you who didn't, essentially I was triggered by police sirens and sent into an odd state of both incredible fury and crushing fear that the government was coming to get me, during which I did many things that I wasn't really aware I was doing.

Ever since this happened, I've been watching my thoughts, words, movements, etc, and trying to figure out at least a bit of what's happening.

My movements and speech have since noticeably deteriorated.  When distracted, alone, or just comfortable, I allow my body to move as it wishes.  Such movements include jerking in the wrists, the spine tensing up hard enough to make me lean one way (usually right), and my already present eye twitch has become more noticeable.  I also have the tendency to hit things for no reason.  

I slurr and stutter much more often.

I haven't had such a heavy attack since, but I feel as if I am having delusions.  But my acknowledging that the ""delusions"" I am about to list might render them, well, not delusions.

I appear to have plucked out of nowhere the belief that nothing around me is real, that behind me the wall is changing and pulsating between realities, and the like.  Even as I sit here and type this and even state that it is odd, I believe it.

I feel like there is a menacing entity watching me, controlling my life, and tormenting me.

I feel like the end, of the world, that is, is just around the corner, and that nothing can be done about it, that no matter what I do, I and my wife will die.  

I am not very religious, but I somehow seem to know that we're all going to Hell.

Also dreams are our subconscious traveling to alternate dimensions.

My wife has also pointed out to me that, since the attack, my language has become increasingly foul and violent.  According to her I mutter very detailed and gruesome death threats to just about everyone and everything that crosses my path, or anything that so much as slightly irks me.

Massive mood swings pollute my head all day.  From a sad tiredness and a resignation to the fact that nothing will ever matter to a joyous, energetic mood that has me laughing at nothing and skipping about.

This, I think, points to more than just a simple anxiety attack.  I am worried.  I am seeking help, but so far I'm afraid I won't be able to afford it.

Something else that might be of use: I have begun to draw, more often that I ever have, and much of the time my hands seem to move on their own.  I have taken to recording these images.  If it's useful at all, here is a link to an online archive of them all: [Art](https://sites.google.com/view/dcperryartarchive)

Please, any and all advice or input would be greatly appreciated.  I'm frightened and so is my wife.  I will answer any and all questions you might have.

I look forward to your responses.

2,"The reason that it occurred to me that I may have such repressed memories is unimportant, but after doing some research and reading, I am . . .  a little worried that I may have experienced such abuse at some time in my childhood.  If you will, allow me to list some of the red flags I have uncovered:

-Wearing clothing inappropriate for weather; I always feel at my most comfortable with at least three shirts, a hoodie, and a trench coat, with the addition of a neckerchief over my face and a hat pulled down low, no matter how hot it is.

-Guessing what people want done and doing it without them having to tell me

-Fantasies of rape and domination

-Fantasies of being raped and dominated

-An extremely sensitive gag reflex.

-Lifelong depression and anxiety

-Everything in my childhood, to me, appears to have happened when I was four.

-A preference for women in everything; sexual and romantic activities (I am bisexual, but only slightly), friends, teachers, counselors, etc.

-My aforementioned bisexuality might be a concern as well, in that the sort of men I am most attracted to are large, bearded, and tattooed.  Interestingly enough, this is only in pornography and in my head; the few times I have actually attempted sexual interaction with men have made me feel very uncomfortable and dirty.

-Poor hygiene.

-Extensive fantasy life.

These are really just a few, but I think they're all that's needed.

So what do you think?  What can I do about this?",31Dec2016,1
3,"Sometimes I don't really feel like a participant in my own emotions - it's almost like there's this separate 'conscious' part of me that's watching the rest of me panic (it's usually anxiety related) with this bizarre detachment, sometimes with the feeling that I could just take control again and the emotion would stop (though I haven't quite worked out how to do that)

For instance, during a family dinner I started feeling really anxious - nervous hand movements, not making eye contact along with a few other behaviours that I associate with anxiety - it had been building for most of the day - I'm a gay atheist in a fairly religious family (only a few people around the table knew that) and the topic had got round to religion and it panicked me a bit. However I felt weirdly split - there was this one part of me that was had all these anxious thoughts and was exhibiting physical symptoms of anxiety but there was another part that knew that this was irrational and unnecessary which kind of felt like a spectator to the other part.

It's not the first time I've felt like that - fit example I remember a time that I was crying pretty uncontrollably but I was at the same time trying to explain that I was fine and that I didn't understand where this was coming from because I wasn't really feeling sad. 

I've also noticed out it when I've been happy - sometimes there's this separate part of me that's just sitting there sort of trying to work out why I'm happy...

I've not explained this well but is this recognisable to anyone?",31Dec2016,5

6,"Hi, and thanks for reading this post. I'm looking for any suggestions to finding resources to help my brother's adult (35yo) sister, who has  severe mental health issues. She had a psychotic break a couple of years ago and it's getting progressively worse. She believes the Iluminati is after her, and is paranoid all the time. I'll share a couple of examples to explain how deep her paranoia runs. My boyfriend brought a plate of food to her apartment for Thanksgiving, and she threw it in the trash because she believed it was poisoned. She did the same another time when they went to get Dairy Queen. He used a gift card to pay for it, and it spooked her for some reason, and she threw the blizzard at him. She thinks there's cameras everywhere, and has gotten to the point she won't shower because she thinks there's a camera in the shower head. She's declining rapidly into her psychosis, and things are really bad. She had section 8 housing, which kept her somewhat functionable, because at least she had a roof over her head. Now she's been kicked out because she's been harassing the neighbors so bad because she thinks they're spying on her. My boyfriend said  her kitchen is full of bugs, and her fridge has food so old it's black.  He had no idea because he'd always just hung out in the livingroom before when he'd check on her, plus it's so hard to spend time with her for more than an hour or two because she gets aggressive and paranoid that he's setting her up. Due to her paranoia, she won't seek medical help or try any medication. At this point she is about to be homeless, and in her state of mind, she really won't make it out there. It's getting cold, plus there's no telling who will do what to her with her mind so off. What are some resources that can help her? We're all broke, we all barely make min wage and have no funding for medical help. This is in Indiana. Does anyone know of any services? Any suggestions would be deeply appreciated. Thanks.",31Dec2016,1

8,"Loaded question I know, trying to scribble this down before my GF comes back so bear with me, will update as soon as I can.

TL; DR is that I am suffering from anxiety and depression and seeing a therapist.  He suggested after a year of fighting these, that I might be better off trying one of these drugs.  Looking to see how bad side effects would be and how long they might last.  I can't take the anxiety and depressed feelings anymore.

Background:

* Suffered from some sort of depression on and off since high school 
* Anxiety is new, came around when I started my most recent job 1.5yrs ago 
* Been seeing therapist for about a year, he says if he had to call it anything that I have a generalized anxiety disorder.  Never suggested meds until recently, even then hasn't pushed them on me 
* I've been told by therapist that meds can take the edge off but would slow me down...
* In the past year I've gone from 250lbs (70lbs overweight) to 230 while exercising, all the way to 260 when work got bad again
* Also have horrible environmental allergies and can't visit family often because of cat
* Also have asthma and get no sleep so it's tough to get into diet/exercise regularly

I don't want to sacrifice any intelligence/analytical/creative abilities but at the same time I cant keep doing this to myself.  It's getting worse and worse each week.  Thoughts?",31Dec2016,7

These images were photo shopped, however, the state they were in made them seem real enough that it made me extremely nauseous and upset. The effect it had on me persisted for weeks after the event and continued to freak me out to this day.

19,"Yeah, if I met the woman of my life in psychiatric care, like I did when I was locked up over a year ago over a Legal 2000, if the feelings are consensual, can I marry her? And have kids? Share a room together?

I am asking because I always wondered this, since apparently modern mental health wards are not the same as the stuff in movies. 

And I didnt have the balls to ask that latin beauty her number before I got discharged.

And, I want to go into a mental facility to wait out the day that my idiot family dies off. Especially my parents. 

 I am 28. Asian. And I have committed violent criminal acts as outbursts of rage, against my family, and against strangers as well. I also have a extensive felony record (narcotics). I am pretty sure that my next arrest is domestic battery or patricide. 

So I say, you institutionalize me pronto, payable by local and Federal government, For the rest of my life, or my family dies immediately. 

The kids don't have to be cooped up with us. But I want them to visit ""Mom and Dad"" at least annually. And I expect their legal guardians to treat them well in our absence.

If we have a daughter, the first jackass that gets her pregnant, and dumps her, while high fiving his bros, I am going to fucking kill. No psych ward will hold me back. I will take staff as hostages until I get let out to avenge our children. 

The first ""boyfriend"" of my future daughter, will get a ass kicking, and some very foreboding threats if he breaks her heart.

Either that, or I will escape and shotgun-wed his ass to my daughter. Complete with point blank discharges of my shotgun next to his ear as soon as he says ""I do"", and I yell ""Yee-Haw!!!"". BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!

20,"Hey Reddit. I'm not really sure where to go with this. I was clinically diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features, and an anxiety disorder. I think there is more to it though. For reference, I am male by the way. I had a girlfriend at the ripe age of 16 that pretty much forced me into sex at a time I was not ready for. 2 years later, she had constantly grown more and more distant, and used sex to gain leverage over me. Then she admitted after this time that she had been cheating on me for a year. Obviously, I ended it there and haven't seen the bitch since. I'm worried, however, that some sort of schizophrenic personality disorder is affecting me. I'm obviously no psychiatrist, and shouldn't self diagnose, but I'm realizing things I haven't told my psychiatrists. Whenever I get close with someone, I usually sabotage it and just watch it burn. Then when I lose contact with people it makes me extraordinarily lonely. I see things that aren't there. I have severe paranoia of everyone. I have more, I just am done talking about it... no real point to this, I just needed to tell someone. I really really hate that bitch.",01Jan2017,2

She has several mental disorders which is probably the cause. She has eaten a small amount once the past 5 days. She only drinks water and will not drink juice or milk. 

We got into a fight where she accused me of being condescending for telling her that starving herself is unhealthy. Everytime I ask her ""why aren't you eating?"" or ""can I get you [insert healthy food]?"" she gets angry and defensive. She called me unhelpful and told me to stop asking her but what am I supposed to do sit there and watch her starve herself.

 She expects me to know why she's doing it and gets angry whenever I try to talk about it. She accused me of calling her stupid/moron/idiot for starving herself even though it was 2 weeks ago where I said that it's stupid for her to skip meals to lose weight because it's unhealthy and ineffective (this in a casual conversation before she actually started doing it). She won't listen to our parents or me. We do not have the money for a doctor and honestly I have my own mental and physical illnesses that I am suffering from so I just don't have much energy.

23,"Good afternoon, reddit.

I'm always ""confident"" at first, when I know someone wants me, but later it's just neverending hunt for attention. I also suffer from social anxiety, few years ago I wasn't able to order something in a restaurant on my own or get a haircut.  

I've never visited a doctor, because I simply think I can make it alone, I know I don't have the worst problems and I just feel like crying little **** for not being able to live like a decent human being.

I don't really know what's wrong. I don't have any resources available to me to figure it out. At least, none that I know of. I'm in health insurance limbo at the moment, not sure when I'm able to see my new doctor but I'm hoping soon. 

I've been bouncing between feeling nothing and everything. I don't know how else to describe it. I will have a few days where I don't want to be seen/heard/touched by anyone or anything. I just sit alone in my room and watch bullshit on youtube or work. 

Then something will happen, it usually starts with me snapping on someone, but sometimes it will be out of nowhere, and then I'll start sobbing uncontrollably for a while, then I'm fine for a few days. Then the cycle starts over. This has been going on for about a year or so. Can't say what the cause is, wouldn't know. Life is pretty good honestly.

The problem is I don't really know what is wrong with me and doctors are not sure either. Can you please read my story and my symptoms and tell me what is wrong with me and how to recover from it. Thanks in advance!

My story:
In May 2016 after a tough split up with my ex-girlfriend I was very sad and was thinking about her all day every day. With this on my mind I made a decision that I will not think about her and take control over my thoughts. This led me to start doing meditation. I did 30min a day of meditation just to quiet my mind and block incoming thoughts. Later on I would start doing visualization exercises – imagining stuff and planning the future. I was constantly looking to block all incoming thoughts about her just so that I don’t feel bad. After doing 1 month of meditation I was still feeling normal, nothing really seems to have changed. I was still thinking about here every day and that made me sad. Then one day in the end of June I found the book The Power Of Now by Eckhart Tolle. I read the book for 3 days, reaching the middle of the book where something happened. I was really believing in what I was reading and was pondering on every piece of information there – that I am not my mind, I don’t need an ego, I have to live in the present etc. Then on the 3rd day of reading I felt suddenly very scared and anxious. I felt something was changing within me. I got scared and went out with a friend of mine. While we were out I suddenly got a strong headache in the back of my head and felt that I was going to faint and die. After this happened the whole world felt unreal – a very strong derealisation. This is where all changed for me. After this happened I couldn’t sleep for days, I couldn’t think about anything, couldn’t focus at all, could not meditate, basically I thought I was going crazy and felt suicidal. I couldn’t follow conversations as well like I wasn’t receiving the information from anything. With this happening I forgot my ex-girlfriend – as I said I was thinking about her every day all day and after this change I wasn’t thinking at all about her like I couldn’t connect to this pattern of thinking and it didn’t bother me anymore. By that time I was in the UK but when my mother listened to what happened to me she insisted that I return home to Bulgaria. When I returned I was sent to a mental ward because of my symptoms and they diagnosed me with Psychosis, which I don’t believe I had. I stayed for 2 weeks in there and was put on anti-psychotics ( Olanzapine). For about 1 month I was unable to do anything at all – neither watch TV or follow conversations like I didn’t have a mind to process anything – it was really terrible. This is the beginning of my story and I want to share how I have been feeling for the past 5 months after leaving the mental ward.
Current Symptoms:
-	Unability to visualise anything with my mind. I can barely see stuff in my Mind’s eye and when I do it is for a moment and they are very dark and distant, whereas before I could picture a lot of stuff in my head without a problem and hold on to the images and scenes I was creating.
-	Can’t track time. Have a feeling that it is going too quick. Feeling timeless. Stuck in 1 moment.
-	Mind is empty – no thinking about future, past or anything. When I do think I can barely hear my thoughts. They seem as they are not mine and are very distant and can’t even distract me.
-	Absolutely no retention of new information – I can read something whole day and won’t be able to recall the information I have read about. It feels like at the moment of reading I am understanding what is said but afterwards the information doesn’t end up anywhere and can only think about it when I am directly asked a question about the information, otherwise I won’t be able to recall it.
-	I can’t get into doing anything because I don’t see a point in doing anything. It is like I can’t imagine why would I do a certain thing and how it can benefit me. It is like I don’t have the ability to see a point in doing something.
-	Disconnected from memories – they seem very distant, even yesterday seems very distant. I can’t relate to my memories like they happened to somebody else.
-	No inner dialogue – nothing to stimulate me to do anything with my life. Nothing to tell me ‘get up you have to do that’ or ‘get on with your life’ etc. I can stay whole day and do nothing and won’t have anything in my head to tell me what I am doing is wrong, whereas before that if I am lazy for an hour my inner voice will tell me to get up and start making something with my life. It is gone now.
-	Not feeling any emotions – I don’t feel anger, anxiety, sadness, happiness, excitement all of them. I try even provoking them but it doesn’t work, like they don’t exist. I was having an anxiety disorder before this but after what happened it seems like I don’t even know what anxiety is. Like I can’t understand it.
-	Feeling like an observer – when I watch TV or listen to music for example I can’t get my mind into it. Like you know when you are listening to music and you are focused you start daydreaming and creating stuff in your mind connected to the music or have emotions. In my case it feels like I am just observing the music. I know the song which is played but that is all, can’t get my mind into it.
-	Nothing to speak about when I am with friends or family. I used to speak a lot before, always has a topic to share or discuss whereas now it seems like I have nothing in my mind to share, even if something comes in my head and I share it I don’t feel anything towards it. Like it doesn’t bring any pleasure communicating and I can’t make sense of it.
-	All of my dreams and ambitions has suddenly vanished and don’t make sense to me. Like I can’t imagine why I would want anything in the first place. Like there is nothing to be wanted from life. Can’t see any positives or negatives.
-	Feels like I don’t exist – When I try speaking to myself in my head it seems like it doesn’t resonate anywhere or have any effect. It is like I am talking to nothing if that makes sense. I used talk a lot to myself for motivation but now it doesn’t make sense. Like there is nothing there to motivate or a person that I am talking to. This is very hard for me to explain, hope it made sense.
-	Can’t connect to the people around me – it feels like I can’t make any connection or understand the people around me. Like nothing interests me or I don’t care about a thing in the world.
-	Feels like my mind can’t be provoked by anything. I have a feeling that even if a bomb drops within 1km of me I won’t care, like it won’t make any impression on my mind or said in other words it is like I am not understanding or making sense of the stuff around me.
-	Slight derealisation – seeing object a little bit blurred
-	Feeling like I am in a dream and don’t experience anything of what is happening.
-	Nothing makes sense around me – I don’t understand why people would work or make money or follow dreams, it feels like I can’t grasp these things with my mind, like they don’t exist – very hard to understand for me.
-	Very bad short term and long term memory. Would also wonder if I have done something or not.
-	Feels like my mind is restarting every minute. If I lose track of my thought process after 1 minute it seems like it never occurred I can’t recall it
-	Very hard to use my knowledge – seems like everything I have known is locked away somewhere and I can’t access it. Feeling very dumb.
-	I can’t think properly – very hard to get any information from my head and when I want to do it hurts my head.

First, some context. I'm Male-bodied (tho I identify as Bigender), 21, with Asperger's, Anxiety and Depression (and other things but let's keep this focused). I've been struggling with my mental health for years now, and in February 2016 I was both very physically and mentally unwell. I took a year's leave (the maximum I'm allowed) from the third year of my Chemistry Degree to try and sort out my mental health, mostly my Anxiety and Depression. Unfortunately due to the way the system works in the UK I've only had one appointment with a therapist, back in the middle of December, and I'm due to see her next in the middle of January. I'm meant to be restarting my degree in Feb 2017, but I'm really not sure if I'm well enough. I've been really struggling with my health for most of the past year and I'm worried that the extra stress of my final 6 months of uni will push me over the edge.

My doctor wants a descision by this Thursday. Either i return to study, or I drop out of tge course abd have to start all over again in year 1 if I want to try again. The Department of Chemistry have been unhelpful when I've asked them what will happen if I can't return. My parents want me to return to uni, and I don't know if they'll support me if I'm not studying. So potentially if I leave I may be without a house (due to my tenancy agreement stating I must he a student) and without money.

I'm finding it very difficult to make any sort of decision with regards to the situation. It's also been making me more anxious and depressed so that's never good.

I'd like to know what you anonymous folks of Reddit think I should do. I'm happy to provide more details if you think it'd help.
