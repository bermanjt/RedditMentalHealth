0,"I've been depressed for close to 6 years, I'm now 19 almost 20. Before a few months ago I've never bothered going out of my way to seek any medical health because I wasn't old enough to go on my own and still havnt told my mom. When I went my Dr she said there was a waiting list and sent a fax to my hospital. I can go into the hospital at any time to admit myself but thinking about it gives me anxiety all on its own. Not only that but I don't want to go alone or feel comfortable having a friend come with me.

But anyways I'm looking at a lot of threads and I'm beginning to get more concerned because a lot of people are mentioning how people tend to get better closer to their early 30s.
I've delt with this numb, lonely, emotional pains for so long and, been through so much emotional hurt in between these years I can't see myself copping for another 11 years...

Any suggestions on what steps I should take...?",14Jan2017,0
1,"Outpatient treatment was an utter failure for my agoraphobia and everything I've read about inpatient treatment says it's no better. Does anyone have any experience with halfway houses? I know nothing about it, but it has to be better than being a shut in with family that doesn't want me to leave. ",14Jan2017,1

6,"So I'm 20 and I have trouble remembering people's names. I also today noticed I couldn't remember if I had seen a person that day and they said that I had which I found strange (it was a big family breakfast with about 15 people and I didn't converse with her so maybe that's it?). At times I can't remember if I told someone a specific story or not. I'm not sure if it's stress or lack of sleep that's (or both) that's effecting my memory, but I always jump to worst case scenario in my mind and every time I forget something like I said earlier I freak out and think it's early signs of dimentia. Any opinions on the matter of ideas to improve my memory?",15Jan2017,1

8,"I come from a long linage of abuse, my family has it down to an art... It starts with a severely narcissistic parent and their codependent spouse. They have absolutely no idea how to show affection for their kids because they were never taught. They run the kids through situations that you'll just have to use your imagination for. The attention starved kids break in one of 2 directions, either become equally as narcissistic, and because of it do well in life and go on to have their own kids and repeat the process. Or, are shattered, never get their lives together, barely hold jobs, never hold relationships and die alone in their early 60s of alcoholism. Every single member of both sides of my family, is living or did live one of those two lives going back at least 3 generations.

I did not turn out to be the narcissistic kid, so you see my problem. I'd rather not die like this. I'm coming up on 32 and have just been shattered all my life. Suicidal since I was 14, in therapy since I was 16, and I've tried all of the medications. It got so bad that 6 months ago I dissociated for 3 days and that changed me. Losing my identity made me look at myself in third person and see all of the self sabotage and what motivated it. I've seen those people before, that are so broken by an event that they stumble through life blatantly destroying themselves until they finish it and everyone just watches because they know they can't help. I didn't realize I was one of them. Since then, there's more of an adult tone to my inner voice. I hold myself to higher standards and I recognize my bullshit for what it is and stop some of it. But there's still so much more that I can't seem to stop, can't improve about myself. It's like realizing the cancer has metastasized, it's so woven in to who I am, so incompatible with the things required for a happy life, that it feels like a death sentence. 

I've never been able to tolerate group therapy, I instantly get bitter and refuse to interact. I suddenly realize that it's because I'm terrified that they're my future. That I'm living the life that ends with me being 50 or 60 sitting in a chair circle crying about what my parents did. It disgusts me.

I don't know what else to do. I'm about to make some changes that could be good. A good job that could become a great job, I've never had either. A move to a place I would love. A slightly more adult mentality. But I've said this stuff before. Every few years I get a burst of optimism and swear to fix my life because I'm getting old and it's my last chance, make a good effort for a while but eventualy get derailed by a major event or run out of steam. I can't let myself do that again, and yet, I'm not working nearly hard enough to ensure that. It seems egotistical to think that I would be the one out of dozens to be able to break the pattern. It would take a monumental effort to fix that much, when I don't seem to be able to make the effort normal people do. I'm both optimistic because I've never had this perspective before, but utterly crushed because I see how bad the odds are.",15Jan2017,1
9,"To preface I have diagnosed BPD, depression, and severe anxiety. I have struggled with relationships my entire life, particularly with my mother, who also has BPD, emotionally abused me and have had an extremely convoluted relationship with. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for nearly 11 months now. I've never experienced anything like this. I can honestly say he is one of the most devoted, loyal, kind and caring people I've ever met. The enormity of how much he cares for me was a little confronting in the start of our relationship but I've come to appreciate it so much. I feel genuinely safe with him, which I do not feel with many people. 

I honestly don't know where to start. I have a chronic pain illness that is a huge stress and can often cause me to have very bad mental health for days/weeks at a time. I'm currently in remission though and have been struggling massively with my BPD. 

I have a very bad habit of starting fights often and for no reason. I get irritated at tiny things that he doesn't mean. I project my massive insecurities onto him and can be jealous, snappish, sullen. I have fits of irrational anger. I struggle daily to feel anything above rage to numbness. I hate it, I hate myself, I can't help it. 

I know we can be perfect. I know it's there, I know it's possible. I'm terrified that he will start losing feeling for me because of how awful I can treat him. 

I've been seeing a psychologist for about seven years, and have been on all sorts of medications. The only meds that subdued my irrational rage at all have numbed me totally in every other way. I see myself in my mother constantly - I am terrified that I will turn into the monster she was made by her mental illness, and treat others like she did me.

(Sorry if this is a little scrambled - sleep meds!)

Thanks for listening guys. ",15Jan2017,6
10,"I have never posted here before, so a little background. I am a male, in my early 30s, financially stable, independent, successful, and a train wreck of mental stability as of late. I am in a higher-level position in my company, directing legal, compensation, leaves, benefits, and workers compensation.  I also have a rental property and a side business.

It all started about 3 months ago when I went to Rome for a vacation. It was beautiful in the fall and I was able to explore on my own (solo traveler) and just enjoy the people, history, and culture. Nothing bad happened while away, it was pure bliss and a trip I will not forget.  

I came home and did with everyone else does, I returned to work that Monday.  After being in the office for no more than an hour, I wondered why I returned, as I was stressed, mentally exhausted and just overly unhappy. I thought to myself, this is just a side effect of the highs I felt while on vacation and it will pass. I gave it a few weeks, knowing my brain and my body and here we are 3 months later and I literally cringe every time I look at my phone and see a work e-mail / text message and or the 4 days a week I work in the office.  This is just added on by not being staffed enough to handle the volume or not feeling compensated enough for all the extra work (not saying money, there are other ways to compensate someone.  A 4 day weekend where I don’t come back to 1,000’s of e-mails would be compensation to me. ) 

During the past few weeks, I have had anxiety / panic attacks when leaving the office, at home, and even anxiety driven dreams when I am dreaming about work and I literally cannot leave (it is a dream, it does not have to be logical).

The final piece of this was last night, we had our year end celebration of our success and all of our location managers came. This event is meant to be a party for recognizing our employees, relaxing, and meeting some of the employees we at the corporate office don’t get to see. We held this event at a large venue (a casino that has a concert stage / are in it) and about 500 employees were there.

Time: 6:30 PM - Within 7 minutes (I kid you not, I looked at the time I walked in the door VS the time this was brought to me), another employee working at the same level as me in a different section of the HR department asked if I had talked to XX from store XX. I said no, I just got here and she said “ok, he has questions for you regarding his pay” and walked away. After she walked away I thought to myself, this is not the place for that and wondering what they expect me to do, here. 

She returns within a minute and brings over the employee and introduces smiles, leaves us. Come to find out, she or her counter part told these employees I would be bringing my work computer and RSID token to correct the issues on-site.  Right away in my head I went “are you fucking kidding me”, I smiled and just said there is nothing I can do here, I do not have anything with me nor is this the place to be working on confidential information and he was of course upset, as they wanted to use that money to gamble (again thinking, I am really the wrong person to be telling that to). 

Time 6:50 PM – I go and find the team members that report to me and my boss, say Hi and sit with my team during our annual awards. These awards finished up at around 8 PM and we are to have dinner, but I am not hungry, mostly due to the ambush. I left by 8:30 PM, thinking I will never go to another event.

As I drive home, I ran the situation in my head over and over again.  Trying to figure out why anyone would think that at an annual awards celebration that I would be the only one with a computer and working, am I wrong here? If we were talking about an entire payroll, you can’t pay your mortgage, you are in dire straits, I would have found a way to complete the transaction, but it was $100 for employees making enough wages to put him into upper middle class.

This morning, I woke up soaking wet to another anxiety dream. I proceeded to pull out my computer, send a quick note to my boss and my employee requesting FMLA paperwork. 

That is my backstory. I work out to zone out to music every day at home (treadmill). I am at a loss of what to do moving forward. Do I take my leave or part of it to attempt to re-charge or do I abandon ship. Do I work for someone else again, do I go back long enough to get my business at a little higher income and just do that? While I know people will say the interwebs is not always the best place for this type of advice and that is true on each extreme side. However, I feel what better place than where others may have had a similar life experience.

27,"Hey /r/mentalhealth. I must profess up-front that I am visiting this sub for the first time and do not know its proper formatting and/or etiquette.  


I am trying to find a way to help my mother and my sister, both of whom live together the Pacific Northwest. For the time being I am living with them until I can get myself back in school, and, quite frankly, I am nearing my breaking point... My mother, a diabetic schoolteacher, [is a hoarder](https://imgur.com/a/okx5U), and probably has Parkinson's Disease, far advanced enough to prevent her from going to work roughly one out of every four days; my sister is half a decade out of high school and has yet to hold employment, a volunteer position, or to pursue further education; and our family is deeply in debt. Talking to either of them about such concerns usually causes them to 'shut down'. My mother is too young to qualify for Medicaid and similar such programs, and my sister does not want to go onto disability. We have no other living blood relatives.  


What can I do to provide the assistance they so desperately need? I tried to separate myself from this situation by attending university out-of-state, but I refused to cut off communications with life back home, and I found myself unable to escape thoughts of the continually catastrophic living conditions faced by my mother and sister. (For example: last winter, during a record-breaking storm system, our basement flooded with 2ft of water, disabling the furnace in one of the coldest spells in recent memory -- something I heard about extensively over the phone during final exams.) Ultimately, I chose to withdraw from university after my performance plummeted over the course of several semesters, and I now hold a transcript that places me beneath the federal standards for financial aid.  


I have looked into local mental health resources, but all of them have some sort of requirement that my family does not meet. Right now I am between jobs, though I am interviewing for several positions next week, and I contribute around half of my paycheck towards our bills and my mother's loans. However, I seem unable to earn enough to make a substantive difference, even when coupled with my mother's income.


I simply do not know what else I can do. I do not feel like I can abandon the two of them, yet I also cannot bear to remain in these conditions which are perpetuated by their lifestyles.  


If nothing else, can anyone in this sub relate, or provide advice for getting through the day? I do what I can, but it seems that I cannot do enough.  


Thank you.  ",15Jan2017,8
28,"I assume whoever reads it can go google the traits and causes of narcissism. The long and short is that there's some emotional neglection in my family and my mom has obvious narcissistic traits -- just had a fight with my little sister in fact where she was, as usual, ""gaslighting"" turning arguments around to inception skewered truths to disarm my sister. It's really difficult to reduce the issue here to less than the full story which I will spare you for, but believe me, she's one of the most obnoxious people in the world when you dive below the pretty surface, and it comes from the fact that her mom back in the day never acknowledged her for anything. The idea then is that the neglected child compensates for her lack of love and support by externalizing her inner frustrations on her own children maybe not even consciously but it's like an obsession.

After 23 years of this I've realized my own social issues probably stem from her way of thinking affecting me or maybe there's a genetic factor. As early as when I was 5 years old I told my mom when she asked me to find a friend ""But I want to meet someone who is like ME."" which I only realize now is a sign that I felt excluded from ""normal"" people. I've often suspected aspergers which can also have narcissistic traits but I'm not sure as I'm not quite as obviously strange in my norms as the few aspies I've personally met were.

But really, I can't make friends and my only friend I barely ever see anymore I kind of loathe tbh because he has found success where I have not and his family and friends acknowledge him while my mom never listens to anything I've said unless it reaffirms her own idea of how great she is.

And i have this obsession with only bothering with people that personally resonate with me. I cannot feign interest in people I don't automatically care about and I can get incredibly egotistical on the inside to the point of being frustrated and rude in my thinking when things don't go the way I want them to in my head.

Excessive temperament is lurking inside me ready to burst out, which is why I isolate. I'm ashamed of it. The first time I realized this was an exclusive trait was when my middle-school mates back in 9th grade all agreed that I was one to get really angry over my pc games and I sensed they did not understand it and took distance from it.

All I know is, I'm not normal. I'm not desireable yet I have really high expecations and thoughts about myself and I have this inner feeling that I deserve to be a hero or something. It's really hard to put into words, but I don't wanna go into attempting relationships if I know I'm a narcissist who will ruin his children mentally in 30 years and fostering this family tree of emotional abuse even further.

Criticism hurts me so much I worry I will go into a rage-flip or worse, but I feel it might be necessay. I just want to know what I can do in case I really am a narcissist to become a better, more humane person who genuinely wants the best for others and cope with conflicts in a non-destructive way.",15Jan2017,1
