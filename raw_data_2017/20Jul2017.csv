0,"I'm 32, and have never had a remunerative job for more than a very few months for many reasons, some involving mental health issues, and some involving not needing to (I haven't been living off others like a sponge, I just had some life circumstances that allowed me not to work). After this summer, I'll be done with my studies for a degree I've worked on for awhile now. Naturally, I'm looking for a ""real"" job that will last me much longer than a few months. 

So last week, I was told by one potential employer that they would ""start the process"" with me this week, meaning either the hiring process or the interview process (the boss knew me and my capabilities as a worker, so I wasn't sure which). I haven't heard from them since Monday, when I let them know the date I could start. Meanwhile, I'm looking around the internet, and find the job listing they had posted re: my potential job had been taken down. I haven't even had a real interview and haven't officially been offered the job, so I know it wasn't taken down because they've decided upon me.

Questions I have:

1) Why would they tell me they would start any kind of process with me, and then go hire someone else?

2) How will I find my job with my depressed, anxious, and socially anxious personality? 

I feel betrayed and hopeless.",20Jul2017,2

3,"Been drinking heavily for the past year now (23/f) and recently every time I drink I've been getting the urge to get into my kitchen knives and carve away.
Been able to resist until last night when I went through with it and now I've woken up with cuts and band-aids on my both hips and forearms.

While I probably should, I really don't want to quit drinking, or cut myself for that matter. I'm just... any tips on how not to give into self-destructive impulses while drinking?

5,"So I started taking LSD last winter and my first 4 trips were great. Then one night I had a bad trip and quit for like 3 months. THEN I finally gained enough confidence to take it one more time. This time, I completely lost my shit and found myself in a room begging my friends not to leave my side as I was terrified of ""getting stuck in a trip"". After that night everything seemed normal for a month or two but then out of nowhere one night I got this bad nervous feeling in my stomach (the same feeling as the last time I tripped). It's been two months and every waking minute I have this terrible feeling in my stomach and am constantly nervous and am constantly scared im going insane or that the acid has made me insane.

6,"Has anyone ever experienced feelings of, well, things not being real? Like you're stuck in some sort of dreamlike state?

I've had the odd moment like this before, but never something that's lasted more than a few minutes.

For the past few days, almost a week, I've been stuck in a heightened state of anxiety. And with that is a feeling of being ""spacey"", that things aren't real. Even though I know they are, fundamentally, it's like there's a disconnect in my brain.

I'm not sure if it's being caused by the medications I'm taking, or my anxiety, or that it's making my anxiety worse which is prolonging the feeling.

I do see my therapist tomorrow, and a call has been put in to the psychiatrist at the office who handles my meds.

But I'm hoping for some insight, or shared experiences. ",20Jul2017,3

8,I have schizoaffective-bipolar and addiction. I'm glad that I don't drink anymore so that I can have two jobs be social etc. I am struggling with opiates and benzos though. I am a lot of opiate powder right now and will be out by tomorrow and know i will be an emotional wreck like I was yesterday. My apartment screams junkie so nobody comes here because I hide it from everyone. I'm past the point of seeking out a social group of addicts. I am always in paranoia or mania or withdrawal without them. I spent the entire workday miserably pacing and being pissed off. I love to read and lose myself in books on my breaks and whenever I'm zonked out. I also like to write but show up to meet with others writers high. I'm always high or fiending and I think they know. I just want to be okay. If I were drinking I would be dead by tomorrow but I can't seem to get my head that this crap will do the same thing. I will spend my day off tomorrow trying to figure out how to get more and I'll get more Friday but I'll be miserable st work until I get it. This is no way to live. ,20Jul2017,1

17,"I am not one to throw diagnoses around or labels or anything like that, but I have been what feels like suffering for a long time and want to know exactly what the issue is and how to fix it.

This is a really rough, un-detailed version of the story, there were so many small details I left out due to the vivid nature of the details I'd have to go into to truly explain what I saw and I have tried to keep it as simple as possible.

The experience occurred in 2012 (5 years ago). I was woken very suddenly by my very panicked mother in the middle of the night after going back to sleep after hearing a few unusual noises (which I now recognize to be the sound of my Dad going into cardiac arrest) I went into her bedroom and found my Dad laying on the bed, no longer breathing with froth in his mouth. I touched his foot and it was very cold, the paramedic on the phone asked us to try and move his body onto the floor and he was just too heavy, me and my mum could not move him. The ambulance arrived and he came back to life 9 times on that bedroom floor, then was taken to the hospital and spent 4 days brain dead and never came back home. It was very sudden there was no obvious signs at the time to us that he would have a heart attack and die, although we did see some symptoms that definitely make sense for it to happen, does anyone ever expect there dad to have a heart attack just because he has a few what seems mild, random health issues. 

I know that for PTSD to occur the experience is most commonly extremely violent, scary or tragic. I didn't experience an extremely violent act or scary (Depending on what you class as scary) but the effects from this in my opinion are actually similar to the symptoms of what I know to be PTSD and it has been proven the death of a parent can lead to forms of PTSD. Due to the suddenness (literally overnight) of his death I think that it has caused a lot of issues.

I am constantly remembering the experience in fine detail; noises and sounds that occurred throughout the experience. I remember exactly how they looked with every detail very vivid in my mind, I remember the way they felt when I touched him and bluey/grey colour his skin had turned, I remember the panic my mother showed, I basically remember it all as a video in my mind as if it had just happened. The only thing I don't have any recollection of is how long it went on for, it could have been less than 10 minutes or longer than an hour and I really couldn't say, although it did feel like a very long time in person, in my mind it all goes very quickly.

For months after the experience I had no emotions, I was very much unable to feel happy or sad, and any connections I had to people (holding a grudge against, unhappy with or anything negative towards them) was gone, I no longer felt anything at all other than neutral. And then one day it was like a switch was turned on and I suddenly felt everything. It had hit me all at once all these memories of what had happened and my emotions were stronger than ever. 

Since then I have constant flashbacks daily, I am extremely paranoid and anxious because of it, it has caused me to become someone who overthinks even more than I did (which is quite an extreme amount) and endless other effects that make day to day life abit of a struggle, sleeping has always been an issue for me but it was made much more difficult since the experience, I have always been quite a nervous person also but this has just been enhanced.

I know that there are people out there who have been seriously effected by PTSD from very extreme experiences and in no way am I dismissing that. So please respect that I understand that what I have experienced could be nothing compared to some but it  is also a very real problem in my life and as an individual I see no negative in reaching out for answers.

19,"Okay, I am absolutely going to tell someone, but who do you tell? A suicide hotline? The police? He's not doing it today.

If I'm out of the loop I can't help.  
  
If he gets committed (is that still done?) I'm sure he'll lose his job and I can't see how that helps someone *not* to kill themselves.

21,"Hi I'm George I'm 16 and I've been struggling for a while now and I don't know what's happening to me and I don't know when it started 

I used to smoke a fair bit of weed and it was alright for a year or so and then slowly I started getting more anxious when I was high. For example I started losing the ability to keep eye contact with people and to concentrate on words and I started to develop a hate of being touched Like if someone sat next to me I'd be trying so hard to make sure my legs don't touch there's and I'd end up having a really stressful time in social situations and slowly all of that came in to play in my sober life and it's horrible I find it so hard to cope and now when I'm with friends sober or not I struggle to speak to them fluently 

And a couple months ago I took two ecstasy pills and I came down rather psychotic from them and spent the next day in hospital because I was so traumatised by the night I've done E many times but this one time I felt like I was being tested by all my friends and my community and I felt like everyone was trying to stop me from doing drugs or something and they were all helping me like in the hospital I felt like the nurses were fucking with me like messing with my head on purpose and I'd be watching TV and I'd feel like the commentary would be directed at me it was quite weird I had these mild symptoms for a week and every now and again they'd pop up and I'd question myself if I'm being fucked with on purpose or if it's just a joke 

I've quit drugs for a couple of months now after that traumatic experience and I feel like I've gone completely mental though for the past 6 months I've been googling all these mental disorders and I feel like I relate to a lot of them or i don't know If I'm over thinking it and I'm actually planting them in my head because I believe I have them I don't know. I know have anxiety for sure though but it's gotta be more than that Coz my head feels really fucked up. I notice that listening to music around people triggers me into a state where I feel the lyrics have meaning and it impacts my thinking for example say if a love song starts playing on the radio at work when I'm around my colleagues I can't talk to anyone because I feel like theyll think I'm gay if I talk to them while the loves songs playing and I don't want anyone to think I'm gay because I'm not and people have thought I was gay in the past because when someone insulted me I'd take it quite seriously and act angrily but really I'm just sensitive and easily pissed off 

But anyways guys I'd really appreciate it if you help me out and can you be ocd about failing because I'm really critical of myself in everything I do if it's talking, singing, sport, work if a fuck up I tend to be pretty harsh on myself and I feel like I've disappointed other people as well as myself and it makes me quite upset all the time like I'm a person that just wants to be perfect for everyone in my life and I feel like I'm a bit of an attention seeker too as I've become quote lonely when all these mental illnesses came a long but again guys help me out please!

23,"I always do things WRONG. People always get tired of me. I am very sensitive and defensive. I think i have good points but I DONT, just incoherent ones. I am almost 26 years old and have never been in a serious romantic relationship. Im just not that appealling apparently. I never had a lot of friends. Just a couple that I know have my back. My family never had the most money. We have struggled my entire life. I just dont know when itll be better. You know maybe in my next life I'll be reincarnated as a chad who has a rich family, many friends, and who the ladies love. Can this happen? It could. I may also be reincarnated as a damn frog but maybe my frog life would be better than the depressive suicidal life I live now. I try to do right and think positive but for some reason that never works for too long. I have thought about ending things since I was 8. Sometimes life is too much for the brain to take. I wonder how people are able to have everything. The cars, clothes, women, job, personality, etc. How do they do it? Maybe it is just genetic. Some of us are predisposed to be that way while others are the peasants in life who serve the better people.  Sometimes i try to pretend to be an elevated person but perhaps I'm just a peasant who needs to work in the fields and stop pretending. My daydreams of how my life should be arent going to happen. I'm stuck and dont k ow how to get out from where I'm at. I thought I was doing well at mt job with taking on so many responsibilities with the limited time frame per day I had to finish them but I see that helping out is not the best course of action. Its better to be selfish in life because thats the only way you will make it. The problem with that is Im not a selfish person.

It's not the first time I've not felt anything, I recognise the feeling (edit 1: or lack there of) (in fact I made a post around that time using the same throwaway) and I've had minor episodes since then. Also since then I've thought increasingly often about suicide, and struggled not the relapse into self harming (which is oh so tempting).
Recently however, these thoughts have become ever more vivid and intrusive, for example I'll suddenly realise in the middle of a lesson that I've been staring at a piece of paper, fantasising over killing myself and have absolutely no idea how long Ive been doing so or what has been happening around me, or I'll look up and see a very, very detailed image of my slit wrist or my corpse (which triggered the first of the aforementioned attacks a few weeks ago which have, as stated, become a common occurrence of late.

The problem is that I have been helping my parents care for my brother with special needs, and have been told that if I were to move out, it'd be more difficult for me financially to be comfortable in life.  

So basically, they're telling me to stay home because if I move out, I won't be home so they can have the help they need for my brother.

This blows.  I'm being torn because I want to help my brother, but my parents are saying ""if you leave, you can't go far away and need to be at our beck and call, because we don't trust respite care"".

I'm the one who noticed all the blood running under the door and had some PTSD that lingered (especially because it turned out to be from a fall due to seizure, which had never happened before. She is special needs and developed epilepsy at age 16, so then there was a constant fear of her falling again, which happens fairly frequently). 

Anyways, long story short I finally broke down and get some help. I'm in therapy and 2 monhs into Lexapro (20MG) and 1 month into Wellbutrin XL (150MG). I feel... better, if not totally normal. Enough that I consider it acceptable.

Depression made me a blob that just sort of flopped from bed, to work (an hour late because I've stayed in bed too long), to the couch, to bed again. Luckily my bosses are super hands-off and don't care enough to mention it.e

Letting the house hit ""science experiment"" before it dawns on me that I need to do some dishes, because I'm out of the habit of doing them daily.

I've been in treatment for mental health issues since I was four, I'm about to turn 30. ever since I can recall but especially as an adolescent and adult, the first instants after waking up from sleep have consistently been a true earthquake of negativity about my person which is absolutely impossible to handle and for that very reason I am prescribed alprazolam to regain functionality, which of course during such a terrible anxiety attack I lose completely. To give you a picture, for years up until recently I took 1 mg of alprazolam just to be functional after waking up (normally mornings when you have to get ready to be out the door and take care of your life). lately fortunately I've been getting by a bit better mental health wise and discovered I can develop some cognitive tools to beat those attacks so I'm trying to wean off alprazolam because even though I know I need it I don't believe I can take such a heavy drug for so long in such high doses.

question: I need a strong cup of coffee within the first 3-5 minutes of being awake, otherwise I'm completely lacking in functionality and even self control.

I suffer with severe major clinical depression and anxiety disorder and have done since I was around 9, I'm now 25. In the last two years I've been on more medication than I can remember varying from venlafaxine, mirtazapine, fluoxetine and others along side diazepam for bad moments of anxiety. 

Most of my anti depressants have eventually given me side effects, either making me sick or just generally making me worse. Annoyingly it usually happens about a month after I feel I might be getting better. 

I've been on Lofepramine for around 7-8 months now, the longest one. I was beginning to cut down my dose when I got really bad yet again. My doctor had tried me on one tablet in the morning and two at night but as they aid with sleeping it was making me drowsy through the day. Now I'm on 3 at night (210mg) and finding I feel very queasy once I've taken them and through out the night. I can't sleep much more than 4 hours but to be honest that's quite normal for me with the way my brain works however its draining me. When I wake up I've noticed I'm incredibly clammy and very warm which is quite unusual for me as I have the blood of a reptile. 

My appetite seems to have disappeared a bit over the last few days aswell which to me is okay but is worrying my partner as I have had issues with eating in the past and recently. (He has put up with a lot but he is incredible and stuck by me through everything) so really I don't want to sorry him unnecessarily. 

Has anyone else had any of these side effects when being increased to a higher dose?
