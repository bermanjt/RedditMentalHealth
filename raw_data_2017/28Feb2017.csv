1,"Since I definitely know that I am not first, and it must be casual responding to these posts, I am going straight on it.
Recently i find out that my 16 y.o. girl space friend is struggling with depression. I know she is quite young and it may not seem valid, but i never saw something like that, althought I consider myself as a quite depressed person (I dont say it since now, lol). It really brokes me. Now I want to share my (her) story with you, and hopefully get some personal help, how can I help her, or at least support her.

Lets call her Justine. Justine went on September to a new school, because she finished primary school (I live in the country which slightly differs from normal school system). All the time she says she is totally happy with it the school and the class. There are fine people, acceptable teachers and so on. There is really no reason not to believe her. She is honest all the time to me. But, there is a guy (of course) she fell in love with. He did not know it, and nothing was really happening. Justine was quiet about it, and she was friend with him. No problems. If we skip a few months of nothing, we get to the real start of this topic.

One day, they had a school prom, and after it, they ended in 'her' (her parents) second flat, which was empty. They get a little bit of drunk, and if I make it simple, she told asked if she likes her (not like love her, but like) Told him she likes him too. What I heard from many people, he is quite a fine person.
I know its boring, but this is where it begins. I promise. Please stay. :)))

Somehow happened, her crush - lets call him Harvey ignores her since then, and keeps a distance from her. What I heard from many people, he is quite a fine person. Perhaps he is just not into her, or he is into her, just know how to tell her - in both options. Nobody really know what is happening, because that night, nothing really happened. It wasnt that bad, she just told him she like him.

Now - make it simple again, Justine feels like she lost her crush, who was her friend until now. Month and a half later, I stayed overnight in the flat with her and her other friend. She got opened and basically told us all. She has depressions, out of nothing she finds herself crying, without even knowing why. It is happenening more than three times a day and she cant stop it. What is for me REALLY terrifing, she said she wanted to harm herself in leg, without anyone noticing it. She told us how she was thinking about it, she just wanted to let the steam out, cut herself in the leg, because in the winter and spring, nobody cares your legs. It was really terryfing. And it was no fun. She really meant it seriously. Later that night, paralel to what happened before, she started crying again. She began with many things - but ended with her grandpa in hospital with a cancer of lungs, because he smoked too much. She said she knows it is really a bad thing, but when she feels depressed, for a longer than half an hour, she takes a cigarette just to feel better. She is not a smoker, and definitely smokes only when she is f*cked up. But for example, that night she took about 4-5 marlboros. She was never like an emo, smoker, alcoholic, or a depressed person. It just began that fucking night with the sleep over after the prom. I cant explain how much I am broke just by thinking about all of this.

She has a really best friend and shares everything with him. Its my friend too, so I am in contact with him, and we are trying to somehow help her. Only, he lives about 50km away from him, and for him its not easy to meet with her. Even he tries as much as he can. So, I am closer to her the distanc-ional way, and he is closer to her the emotianal way.

Her parents dont really understand, even Justine's doctor told them. None of us know them, and she goes home by train, so we dont even know where she is living. They only have a tiny secondary flat in the middle of the town, to stay over between school and coaching, treninks, so on.
We tried to sent her to a psychologist, psychiatrist. The school one, even the proffessional one. Problem is she is quite scared, and shy. And to go to a proffesional psychologist, she needs a signature of parents, otherwise it would cost A LOT of money.

I know this is not a life-dangerous situation, but it is really bad, and the fact that someone feels even worse, doesnt mean ""Justine"" is fine. She tried to harm herself omg.

Please NOTICE, that she is 16 years old girl. Its not really easy to get her into something. She knows about her problem, only doesnt feel to get help. We, as her friends who know about it, are trying to support her as hard as we can, only we dont really know how. We dont want her life destroyed, but also we know that some things, like telling the wrong people, can make it even worse. For example you cant tell her class, because there would be some assholes who would laugh at her, even she said there are fine people.

So please do the best to help me. But think about she is a living person and first, we need to find out how to get her into something, than getting her in something. Sounds weird, but its simple.

Btw, if anyone wonders, all of us are younger or same as her, she doesnt have older friends, older siblings and so on.
Bad thing also is she sometimes make fun of it, when she is in a normal mood.
Its not about Harvey and her, its really about the depression, and how to solve it. Personally i dont think that solving the problem between them would help it anyway",28Feb2017,1
2,"I see a lot of people saying that excessive masturbating can change/affect your brain. And they go off by saying something something hormone something something excessive dopamine etc... Is this actually true? If so, are the changes that have already been made permanent? Because these people also say that they haven't been masturbating for two weeks to a month and claim that they are ""less anxious, generally happier, and feel more motivated"" ever since they stopped.",28Feb2017,1
3,"I told my parents about my anxiety and at first they offered to let me get psychiatric help, and they backed out of that and just told me not to think about it and just pray... It's harder than they think, and while I understand it can lessen some of what I'm feeling, the anxiety is still really strong. So I was wondering if anyone has more ways to deal with anxiety, or if anyone can recommend any good over the counter medication I can take. Thank you. ",28Feb2017,2

5,"I've read so many posts on this, but I'm hoping someone can share some stories that help me know I am not alone. I've been lurking for a long time and finally made the decision to create an account and post. 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, ptsd, insomnia, and GAD last year. I was placed on Venlafaxine and Buspirone, as well as hydroxyzine to help me sleep. Since then, anytime I drink I become violent. I black out for almost the entire night, and find out I pushed my husband because I was being insanely inconsolable. I bawl, and I shove, and I scream, every time. I have tapered off my drinking as this is not stories I like to hear, but this last weekend was the worst. 

I become such a vile person. I'm not sure what happens, obviously a reaction, and have since made the decision to not indulge at all, which is heartbreaking because I do enjoy a few beers now and again, but I'm legitimately terrified. 

Has anyone experienced this extreme adverse reaction? Or is it just me and I'm more of a snowflake than I thought? ",28Feb2017,1

13,"I have had a rough few months. A few years ago I was diagnosed with ptsd after being the victim of a violent robbery. It caused a few panic attacks followed by a day or two of ultra high anxiety, but would always subside. The last 2.5 months in this order I have dealt with the following things:

-My grandma died unexpectedly

-My cousin aggressively harassed me and made me fear for my safety the night of my grandma's funeral when my family was out at the bar

-I was offered a dream job in a new city

-I found out my brother in law was cheating on my sister

-My aunt died unexpectedly

-I had to call my sister and tell her that her husband was cheating on her

-I got a painful kidney stone and infection

-The job I was offered 10 weeks earlier was rescinded due to budget cuts, leaving me in a position where I fear getting laid off.

I've never had anxiety that lasted before, it was always related to panic attacks due to fear for my safety. My cousin at the bar kept following me and grabbing me aggressively, saying very inappropriate things until I broke down and had a panic attack. The problem is anxiety that usually subsided in time has persisted due to all the other things that have taken place since. I can barely function and can't handle anything I'm going through. I don't know anyone who has gone through anything similar. It feels like it will never end. I keep trying to find ways to cope, and have gone to therapy but reliving these last few months feels terrible at this point. I've barely been able to process the grief of having two loved ones die. Are there any coping mechanisms or words of wisdom for me? I'm really having a hard time getting through this.",28Feb2017,2
14,"Hi, This is a throwaway account specifically for asking for help, my real account is elsewhere. I'll get right down to it.

I'm approximately 20 pounds to 40 pounds overweight, and I don't live in the appropriate conditions to do a lot of things. I live with my parents, as I'm still young, but I'm not allowed to go for walks by myself, and I have no friends who live nearby that I can head out with.

About a year ago I fell into a severe state of depression, and while I'm still trying to get over that even though I have my fall backs, I consider it very successful in some aspects. Anyways...

One night I decided that I was sick of my living conditions and weight. My mother cooks often or we eat out, and as I can hardly do anything myself, I tend to spend most of my life in my bedroom with my computer. I also sleep in very bad hours, as you can see since I'm writing this at nearing 6 or 7 AM right now.

I decided I was tired of it, and after effectively cutting my calorie count a day more-or-less to 1400-1700, I decided it wasn't enough. I started looking up how to purge, I know it's not right but I figured I'll just do it once or twice when I really over ate. 

Well now, it's been 2 weeks and I've tried maybe about 7+ times to vomit, and every time I can't do it. I gag a lot but nothing. So every night I'd come back and look up more effective ways of vomiting and still nothing to this day.

It's sort of a habitual thing now to try even though I've never successfully done it. And while I'm still fairly happy every now and again, some days I can't look into the mirror.

What I'm trying to ask is, is this a warning sign of a disease of sorts even though I've never successfully done it? 

If you can, please, any advice helps to avoid any hazardous options.",28Feb2017,1
15,Self harmed for the first time in a really really long time and just seeing the marks on my skin is making me feel so embarrassed and anxious. I wish I hadn't done it but I was at such a low point and I don't know how to tell anyone. I literally had a great day and then just broke down at the end of it to the point where I was crying so hard I wanted to vomit and I felt like it was the only way to stop it. I'm ashamed of myself.,28Feb2017,4

18,"Apologies for the vent, but I need to get this off my chest.

5 years ago, I started suffering from depression due to a whole range of things - hellish home life, a failing masters project, putting down 4 pets within a year, two grandparents dying (one very slowly and being cared for at home), and losing pretty much all my friends due to personal problems involving my sister.

I received treatment (therapy and an anti-depressant), made some life changes, sorted out some issues, and Ive been clinically free of symptoms for several years.

Today, I have received official confirmation that because of my previous depression, I will not be able to teach English as a foreign language in South Korea. Ive personally been working with 11 to 18 year olds for the past year, have had no relapses or anything of the sort, but apparently I wouldnt be able to be placed anywhere due to this.

Which kinda sucks.

But, Ive just sent off an email to a competing placement agency, Ive emailed the company that I completed my TEFL certificate through to ask for contacts, and Im just going to be holding thumbs and taking it from there. This is a bit of a hard set back, but hey, there's nothing much I can do except try again.",28Feb2017,2

21,"As the title asks, I never use to sleep in basements until I was in a place where it was a say 90% finished basement, now new home tried again that is no where near being a finished basement.

First month, not so bad as long I didn't look at the ceiling, the only window was boarded up and had some stuff on it to seal up the cracks and or spaces. on the other side of it some sort of metal covering it.

the pipe above my bed has yellow rags tied around it that are speculated to be for some insulation. The walls are large bricks and only 2 bulbs and concret floor.

I am very paranoid person as it is and have a phobia of spiders. I thought I saw one crawls from the exposed cd tray on my Pc and made me lose all composure in a second. I then lost track of it. Brought my computer upstairs 1 hour later I thought  I saw it again and freaked out. 3 hours later nothing.

So now I don't even know if what I saw was real or not, I took apart the back of my computer and hardrive out and nothing, just dust. Has living in that basement with no real light for over a month been bad for my mental health? This is only the second basement I've lived in and the two are very different in looks.

23,"My wife and I have been married for 2 and half years, and been together for 9 years.  Yesterday I discovered something that disturbed me and makes me concerned for her mental health.

I don't know where else to ask this question, so I'm just going to ask it here.

First a little background.  She grew up with emotionally (and sometimes physically) abusive parents.  She is the oldest of a number of siblings, and was raised poor.  This upbringing has made her an extremely hard worker and extremely determined, partly to not live the way here parents did, partly to prove to herself that she's not like her parents, and partly for other reasons.  

She often gets overwhelmed with what's going on in her life and sometimes suffers from panic attacks.  It's also very difficult for her to get close to anyone, emotionally and physically.

She has this tick, or something, where she is always picking at skin blemishes.  She is always squeezing pimples and blackheads and scratching at any skin abnormality.  If she gets acne on her face she will literally pick at it until it's an open wound, and then will keep picking at it for weeks, making it worse.  She also constantly tries to pick at me but I always stop her.  

She's not like a schizophrenic or anything.  Other than the things I've mentioned, she is a completely normal girl, with normal relationships.  I know that there are people out there who pick at things, just like some people bite their nails, and others chew their hair.  I always knew she had it a little worse than most but I was never as concerned as yesterday when I found something on her computer.

Yesterday I went to her YouTube page to look something up and her entire homepage was nothing but pimple popping videos.  I went to her watch history and there were about 100 videos in the past week of the most disgusting and vile pimple and cist videos.  I got sick just looking at the thumbnails.  I held my hand in front of the screen and deleted all the videos from her history so that she can have a normal homepage again.  Seeing these disgusting videos that she watched and the *sheer number* of videos really disturbed me.

I want to know what might be going on here and how I should handle this.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.",28Feb2017,1
24,"Hello, my name is Jonas. I am 20 years old.

At first, I want to say sorry for my English if you will find any mistakes or so.

For the past 4 years, I've been struggling with lack of positive emotions. I feel like I am slowly dying inside. It's just getting worse and worse. I have been visiting a psychologist for one year but it did not help. 

I am living with my mother, her friend, and my brother. But I do not talk to them often. I am just closed in my room and producing music. 

I was trying everything that my psychologist suggested me as partying, cinema, theatres, music festivals, meeting friends etc. but nothing improved my mood.

I met one girl 4 months ago. I've told her about everything. But she still wants to be with me although I am who I am. She told me that I make her happy by doing things no one ever did for her. But I am just doing what I think is good or what normal people do to their other half. She wants to help me somehow because she thinks I am a good person and I've got a good heart.

But there is one thing that worries me the most. I can't finish any of my music projects. I just start them. Make a melody and the and. Four years ago I've been recording whole tracks, I felt happy, I knew what I wanted and who I was. But now it's just an empty hole in my chest.

Please, if you can, help me somehow. I don't want to feel like this until I die.

35,"I've been really struggling to get an adequate amount of sleep each night; usually I lie on my bed or couch unresponsive yet conscious enough to know I'm not sleeping (in a sort of half-sleeping state that's very unsatisfying as I'm sure many of you know).

For the last month that I've been experiencing this, I've desperately tried getting to the root of the problem. I had reason to believe the underlying cause was anxiety brought about by an existential crisis that later evolved into health anxiety.

Someone from the anxiety subreddit implied that my insomnia was caused by some other psychiatric disorder; I believed he was implying I was experiencing mania. Part of me is inclined to believe him. Despite little to no sleep and the frustration that accompanies that, I've been surprisingly active.

i should mention that my insomnia began almost immediately after leaving my job. I'm on 30 mg of temazepam but that has been somewhat disappointing. I have no strong inclination to believe I have bipolar disorder but that's always a possibility. Someone else suggested this was all caused by an overproduction of dopamine that was being converted to adrenaline at night, thus preventing me from sleeping.

Anyone else experience a sudden onset of insomnia caused by mania? Is it possible that my anxiety is a side-effect of this manic episode? And, most importantly, if this is all mania caused, what should I tell my doctor? What medication could help me out? Again, a decent dose of temezapam + melatonin + good sleep hygiene + some exercise aren't really getting the job done.

Thank you guys so much, I really really just want to get a decent amount of sleep again and I'm so sick of all of this.

EDIT: My evaluation of general signs of a manic episode: 

* High energy and excessive activity - Yes, lots of energy despite no sleep

    Overly good mood - Somewhat, although I'm very frustrated a lot of the time because I can't sleep

    Irritability or impatience - Yes, I've noticed I can be quite rude. Although I still find it very easy to socialize

    Fast, erratic talking - Probably a little bit. My posts on here also seem to ramble on

    Racing thoughts - A little bit.

    Inability to concentrate - Somewhat. Usually start several books at once, switching from one to the other. I move from subreddit to subreddit very quickly trying to gleam as many headlines as possible.

    Little need for sleep - Hell yes. It's really bad.

    Feelings of power - Not really associating with this one.

    Poor judgment - Ehh, perhaps. Can't agree or disagree.

    Reckless spending - A little bit, could be related to my existential anxiety and feeling that there's little reason to save if life is finite.

    High sex drive - No change.

    Alcohol or drug abuse - No.

    Aggression - Perhaps, related to general rudeness which I believe to be caused by a lack of sleep.

    Refusal to admit that there is a problem - Nope.

39,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. He thinks everyone is out to kill him. His thoughts are rapid and confusing. He wants to be the face of anonymous, he thinks he has AIDS, and one night he has said that he wants to kill all women while clenching both fists and staring at my girlfriend's brother's wife (23) who also lives in the house with her brother (25) and their 4 year old niece. 

I called the police that night. They talked to him for a while and EMS took him away to the E.R. where we followed and stayed for a while where he made a big scene about peeing in the cup and used it to drink water because it was sterile and he didn't want to drink the ""poisoned"" water that the nurse got for him (another of his delusions). He then sucked on the cup until he popped all the blood vessels around his lips and then tried to escape, but it was a locked unit. 

He was then sent to Tufts. He acted normal the entire time here and was sent home after three business days per law. Completely ridiculous. Less than 24 hours later he was at the family's restaurant freaking out about how he wanted his car (his brother was using it to get to and from work and it technically belongs to the parents). He was in the kitchen yelling and then he pulled a knife from one of the cutting boards and threatened to stab him. 

Once again the police were called and the same deal happened. My wife's brother, his girlfriend, and their daughter has had to move out every time he gets out so this has been tough on them too. Anyways, so he spent a week in the emergency room where he decided to take apart his bed one day. Then he was sent back to Tufts for the 3 day hold. He once again wouldn't sign the papers to stay longer and the social worker said they had ""no case to file"" so once again he is home today. 

So now we are just waiting for him to lose it so we can call 911 and go through this hell all over again. ""The mass health care system absolutely sucks for helping their mentally ill loved ones."" Those are the words from my mothers mouth. She has been a social worker for over 40 years.
