We need your support for reaching our goal! The Federal government of Canada has already said they will legalize it in 2021 along with the United States if all goes successfully!

If you can't afford to donate please share the campaign! Every bit helps. MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy has been known to eliminate PTSD symptoms for qualified patients, within only 3 sessions of therapy!

1,"I hide my sadism, amongst other probable personality disorders. I live my life inside my head, fantasizing, waiting, anticipating future actions. Secrecy is the only way to survive, hiding the big bad wolf inside, hoping (hope?) one day I will meet someone who is exactly like me. No fear of repulsion or rejection, utter and complete acceptance ending the charade, breaking the facade. Not having to pretend, just the thought of it is soothing. I do have serious doubts about any of you sadists, but one thing I have learned from experience is that people only show you what they want you to see. Only in moments of anger or inebriation are some able to glance behind the curtain. I guess this is a sort of confession, as most believe I am the exact opposite of what I truly am. There is no cure for this insatiable and relentless bloodlust driving me to join the army. Having a legal (honorable?) avenue for my sick perverse fantasies of something as old as time itself: war, death, battle, being a killer, becoming someone's god. That and my fantasies of sanctioned torture, rape, violence are what get me to question my sanity. Tell me, do I sound normal? Is this standard teenage angst all stemming from raging hormones? Or there something else at work? Something much more devious waiting to begin when the thought is not enough.",09May2017,2
2,"So I just wanted to spill this all out. I have anxiety and I am completely against medication. I've had my anxiety for 6 years and I've been seeing a psychologist for treatment for about 4 years. She recommended me to a psychiatrist to prescribe me medication though as I stated, I didn't want to. I'm 19 years old so they can't force me to take them, thank God. I broke down during our conversation, get to know me, and stormed out the office outside leaving my parents in there because I hated it. 
With all that, I still really want to go back to school in the fall. I love it there; I'm in a sorority I love, got many awesome friends, and just want to be able to prove to myself that I can get a degree. I took a semester off to get better but my parents don't think right now I can go back. I feel I'm getting better and especially if I go back, I'll be happier. Because I know if I don't go back, I'll be super sad and won't know what to do with my life. If you have any feedback, advice, questions for me, or kind words that would be really helpful.

4,"So my gf has only 4 friends, they all grew up with her and, they all live in different states now. Gf has a hard time opening up and making new friends and has alot of anxiety plus she deal periods of deep depression. She has no friends here and I know she is lonely.  Her best friend B is moving here. Gf is really excited.

Growing up gf and her friends all had shitty home lives and they all were heavy into drugs and alcohol. 

GF occasionally drinks and still smokes weed often but doesn't do harder drugs anymore. B is still a heavy almost daily  drinker and still does drugs occasionally (let me add according to gf she is not hooked on anything she is a ""casual druggy"") . 

I honestly wouldn't care what she does but I'm worried with B around next time Gf gets really depressed B will push her back into her old coping mechanisms.  Gf says B lowers her inhabitions and forces her to go out and do things which is great but I can't help but worry about them two together again. According to Gf B would convince her to do a lot of things and Gf was the one who would rein B in. They have alot of crazy stories together.

Gf is so excited about this I almost don't want to bring it up. When B told her she is moving here she literally started crying.  I have never seen her this excited and I know she will be defensive of B.

Neurochemical Malfunctions

Only once have I told the truth 
to somebody who did not deserve it. 
It was over a week ago.
When I, at a social gathering,
suddenly and inexplicably
got up and left the house 
and sat alone outside,
in a plastic chair on the poorly illuminated patio.

The noises and smells that bring the past to present
found their way into my ears and nose.
I hoped to be left alone
to allow the infected whir of memory and fear
dissolve into the rear of my consciousness.
Then, as my breaths swiftly pranced
adjacent to the drone of a cooling wind
maneuvering through the rotted fences,
the door to the loud and hazy kitchen
from where I had just ran, opened.
And there stood the figure of a girl–
a stranger with whom I had never spoken.

No words were said
as she descended down
the sharp stairs that preceded the door.  
Only when she sat across the table from me
did she notice I was there.
Her eyes narrowed inquisitively, and
as the last vestiges of fear leaked 
from the back of my skull,
I responded to her question that I nearly didn’t hear,
and said I was okay. 

The sullen silence that unsued
provoked me into ending it. 
I didn’t know who she was
and she didn’t know me,
and I’d never see her again. 
So I told her the truth. It took two minutes. 

She, electrically bubbling with intoxication,
appeared distracted.
Her eyes were wide, but she said nothing.
As I began to regret my words,
knowing that what I had said was meant for
only the most loyal of ears, 
she, as if aware of my concern,
told me that she wouldn’t remember. ",09May2017,1
7,"Here I am, everyday climbing an uphill battle in hopes that I reach the top of the mountain. That I reach this epiphany where I can grim and laugh without fear of intrusive thoughts or compulsions. 

I am working hard. Medicine everyday (I have never been this consistent), journalling constantly, and am able to keep friendships without using tactics of manipulation and dependence. You could say in many ways that I am 'recovered', I have reached the top of the mountain and here I am, OCD free.

But, this isn't true. I have the compulsions everyday and as new obsessions arise I will find new ways to compulsively rid myself of these intrusive thoughts. The further I climb up this hill, the closer I get to the holy grail (the ability to say 'I am recovered') I realize more and more that this never was a mountain. 

My recovery will be different terrains, and will eventually evolve into a straight, non bumpy path. I guess what I am trying to say is that often we measure our recovery into two terms 'recovery' and 'recovered' but the truth is this journey can't be measured. The journey of gaining power over (in my case GAD and OCD) will never reach an end point, I must take this day by day. Step by step. 

I am ranting and musing but just wondering if anyone relates to this? Like you were once at a point in your life where youre like 'hey my mental illness is debilitating in all forms!' to like subtle dealing with it throughout the day. But once you get to this point you hit a weird plateau, like, where do I go now? where do I aim for?

I never told my parents, assuming it was just a ""phase"", but now I'm in a different school. It is a 7 year school and I'm in 7th grade (it goes until 12) so if I lose all my friends now I'm pretty much fked for 5 more years. In the past week I've lost all but around 3 of my friends and I spend lots of time in class just sitting there and wanting to die. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself but I'm such an ass to anyone that could be my friend that I'm going to end up hating most of my childhood. I don't want to tell my parents because they probably won't believe me, as I never act up around them. I try to gain more friends but my terrible personality eventually comes out and deters anyone from ever considering me as a good person. I don't know if I'm depressed, have asperger's (I'm really negative and always point out the terrible things about people, usually making them hate me and can't get friends because I always see the worst in everything) or I'm just overreacting and a terrible person. Everyone in my school has at least one real friend, whether they're the nerdiest, most hated or introverted kid, but I seem to drift further apart from the people who kind of view me as a friend but at some point hate me for my actions.

11,"I'm 17 and I'm going back to therapy. A few months ago I decided that I needed therapy again so that I could talk about my past abuse. The abuse was emotional and psychological mostly by my mom. I hoped that because the abuse was years ago it wouldn't need to be reported but I thought wrong because any past abuse is reportable even if I am currently safe. So I don't know what to do I want help right now I don't want to wait a full year just to tell someone, and if I can't talk about the abuse I don't know what to talk about in my sessions should I just cancel them I'm scared that its gonna seem strange for me to suddenly back out when I specifically asked for help. So is there any way that maybe an exception to the rule can be made for me so that I can talk without it getting reported? If I can't talk about the abuse what do I do in my therapy sessions? Also if anyone has ever been in this situation before I would appreciate a reply so I can know I'm not the only one with this problem. Thanks",09May2017,2
12,"Just subscribed. I am a 25 year old male. I have somewhat of a psychological addiction to weed and it's put quite a strain emotionally on my relationship with my wife. We have a two and a half year old son and one coming a month from today (at least that is when he is due). I've always had bipolar and anxiety issues since I was a teenager. Since my mom passed I've been smoking pot a lot and of course money is a huge issue there. I make a decent wage so we have been able to afford it but with a 2nd baby coming we probably won't be able to any longer, so here I am alone with my anxiety. I do not medicate. I don't like psych meds. I find with my bipolar it is 99% depression and 1% mania brought on by trauma (last bout was after my mom died 2.5 years ago). So what I'm hoping is someone can understand what I'm going through and give my some pointers. Of the times in my  teenage years and two years ago when I was in the outpatient program in the mental facility here, I've got very little as far as coping skills. Since I've stopped smoking I've been easily agitated and short with my son. It is a horrible feeling to be this way. I hope someone has some advice for me. Thank you ",09May2017,2

I feel like a horrible person, and considered suicide last week. I sought help through the hot line during a panic attack and was able to calm down.

14,"I'm leaving you. I'm sorry, but there's someone else.

Look, I know we were high school sweethearts. We met when I was 15, and the word cancer was placed on the table before me by a doctor who turned out to be wrong. You held my hand through a surgery no 15 year old girl should have to have. You cried with me when the scar didn't fade and I thought no man would crave me because I was ""damaged"".

You held the blade I used to pierce my skin at 16 when the monster I thought loved me cheated on me and then raped me behind the portables at school. When the word began to spread that I self harmed, you told me the wounds were beautiful. That I needed more.

You disappeared at 17 when my eyes met his for the first time, and as we discovered each other's minds and bodies and fell in love...I almost forgot you existed. I was no longer bound to you. The ring on my hand meant I was his.

But at 19, when he lost his battle with you and took his life, you almost gained two trophies for your cabinet. My body shut down, my mind was weak. I turned to anything dangerous I could get my hands on, to be with the one thing I loved. The thing you took from me.

It's been two years, depression. Two years of drowning in your raging tides and devastating winds. Two years of trying to move on and love again, but failing because of my mistress..you.

But I've found a new escape. A happy place. A way to feel and forget at the same time. I've decided I'm ready to live again., I'm ready to feel alive again.

So, dear depression, our story must come to a close. I know you'll be around. You will linger in every lonely night and beckon for me to run back in to your dark, twisted arms. But I wont. I've found other arms to hold me. They will keep me safe.

You wont win.

I feel like accessing the medical system is beyond my current ability for a number of reasons. I find it impossible to think and plan on the timescales necessary to access help. Getting an appointment can take weeks or months, and then referrals take even more time. I simply don't know who I'll be when that time comes around.
Another reason is location, I haven't lived in one place for more than a year in a long time, and the times I feel motivated to get help, are also the times I feel the need to move away. I just feel like it's a maze I don't have the skills to navigate.

Ok so I have a lot of trouble focusing when people talk to me, i zone out a lot, my mind constantly wonders thinking of heaps of different things, generally things completely irrelevant to whatever it is I am doing, eg in class. I cant do homeowork, i cannot physically bring myself to do it, I also cannot commit to anything to keep any routine going for longer then a couple weeks and that is very rare, such as working out or even eating breakfast eveyday or showering everyday. Whenever I am in class I hate trying to focus on the teacher if they talk, it requires so much concentration. I also cannot ever see myself having a job, not sure why but I just. I hate talking to people, or engaging with them sometimes, sometimes i am perfectly fine other days I dread it. My memory seems to be shocking as well considering I am so young.

This has happened to me once, I had the worst day I have ever had, I didnt want to do ANYTHING, I slumped around all day feeling like I had no energy and that life had no meaning, I managed to get myself onto the PS4 to play with some mates but got off because of how draining it was to try and talk to them or even listen, I stayed up all night and began to have suicidal thoughts and how pointless life was and then out of no where I felt amazing, best I have ever felt in my entire life, all of a sudden everything had meaning, it was 7 AM and i look outside at tree for a good 10-15 minutes and was amazed by it and it seemed to have such a strong purpose, I then got back on PS4 with my mates and I couldnt stop talking, I was so excited and my mind was racing with things to talk about.

36,"Hey Reddit...

I'm 31 and my father is 74. For as long as I can remember our relationship has been in turmoil. As well, my father has two other sons and a daughter whose relationships are strained. He doesn't speak to the other two sons, and hasn't for over 20 years. He speaks to my sister, but only when she calls. His relationships with women always end up in disaster and the entire time the relationship are going it's always very shaky and unhealthy. ALL of his personal relationships end up in failure. He has no friends - except for two family members who deal with his antics, because they only see him on occasion.

I have to be honest. I am jaded. I am so mentally exhausted the thought of trying to do anything with him induces anxiety. I've begged him to see a mental health provider, but he refuses, blaming everyone for any issues he has. To him, it's always someone else's fault. He is the victim, and all people want to do is use him for his money. When you point out his personal relationships are in turmoil, he'll tell me that he has held jobs (he has done well, no argument) and that proves its everyone else, or my fault. And he's right. He is able to maintain completely healthy or otherwise conflict free relationships with non family members or intimate relationships. But every relationship that is close is suffering at his helm.

He will lie about events when told or explained to other people. I mean flat out - even if I am a participant in the event, for instance an argument, completely lie about what happened. He loves to instigate and antagonize. He will twist what I say and use things I've told him in confidence against me. He will criticize me at every turn. Trying to do a simple activity for instance like make scrambled eggs will turn into a nightmare if he is around. Because every step of the way he will criticize me and complain about what I am doing. ""The flame is too high"", ""you're using the wrong pan"", ""You're stirring the eggs wrong, the bowl needs to be tilted and you need to stir faster"", ""You sprayed to much non-stick spray""... and it can go on and on until I lose it. Even if I say things like, ""Please leave me alone."" ""Thanks for the suggestion, but I like doing it this way"" He will then laugh at me and tell me how its not his fault I do everything wrong. Then he has a conspiracy theory that if he tells me to do something, for instance ""add more butter to the eggs"" and I don't. I am purposely not doing it his way just to spite him. Even if I explain I am on a diet and don't want to use butter, he'll go on to start instigating an argument by continuing to for lack of better terms screw with me hoping I lose it. Then when I lose it, use it as means to justify how ""I'm the crazy one - see!"" 

He's a manipulator. Goddamn is he ever. 

He will accuse me of doing things that never happened or saying things I never said. And trap me in an argument to defend myself. I fall for it nearly every time.  I try to do what he wants. But just when I think I've got the rules down, he changes them. Every day, he changes what he wants. For instance, he'll complain I need to use the vent fan in the bathroom when I shower, but then when its used, he'll complain I am wasting electric. So when I don't use it, he'll complain the water is leaving Mold. I can never win. Every day, what he wants changes. For various reasons. I never know how to respond or react.

""I feel bewildered, misunderstood, wrongly blamed, exhausted, and isolated."" - anon

I wake up everyday hoping it will change. My dad is old and I want his last years to be one to remember. So I try to hit the reset button. But I have to be honest. I am exhausted. I try to talk to him, but he will literally, after some moments tell me, ""Okay that's enough, I'm going to read the paper"". I am dumb founded.

I try to sit him and and speak candidly, ""Dad, listen I love you, hear me out..."" Anything I say that doesn't make him look perfect, he will argue with me, turn it, and blame me. Basically, whatever I say he has a problem with, he will literally just say, ""nope, that's you"". The equivalent of the kindergarten, ""I'm rubber you're glue...""

He will throw fits about how I do not love him and do not show him any affection. When I point out his behaviour causes me to harbour resentment or ill feelings, he will just say how everything is my fault and all he does is love me and take care of me and so on.

He's very insecure. I have put him on to dating sites. Some hes even paid for. When women message him, he always finds a flaw. Shes too rich, too poor, to fat, to thin, to tall, to short... it just goes on and on and on.

For instance with his age, his memory has become very bad. Out of concern I will bring it up he should talk with a doctor. He will just tell me I'm insensitive and trying to take advantage of him and his memory is fine and its my mind that is bad. But, when you prove to him the times his memory was bad with specific situations, he will play the ""I'm just an old man of course I forget, how can you get mad at me for that""

I'm fucking lost reddit. I feel so infuriated, I can feel the pressure in my eyes. Like they're going to explode. I do not want to do this anymore.

I suspect he has borderline personality disorder or paranoid personality disorder.. as he has many of the traits of both.

The reason, is he is often suspicious of loved ones. As I said, everyone is out to use him in some manner and is disloyal to him, and all he tried to do is be a great human... etc. All his spouses are cheaters, all his kids want from him is money, all his friends want from him is money and things.. etc.

What do I do?

I live with this person, and leaving at this point is not an option. I depend on this person for some support. Which is what allows them to treat me in this manner.

Can I turn him into an authority? How do I convince him to seek treatment?

What do I do short from becoming an alcoholic?

I'm not having it as bad as other people do, but it has grown significantly worse over the last three months or so that I'm afraid it'll only grow worse.

What should I do?",09May2017,1

He has not answered any of my calls and I have no idea where he is right now. Any ideas on what could be happening to him or what I can do to ensure his safety?

The government is not on your side. I am currently being extorted by my government in order to cover up a war effort and a large sum of money being embezzled into a false campaign involving both oil, pharmaceuticals, insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, guns, and funding for both military and national concern in the United States, Canada, England, China, and many other economically advanced countries. I have been repeatedly harassed, stalked, robbed, and injured by this campaign against my government and modern governmental practices.

North Korean war is basically an effort to invest heavily in trade for future business. Average citizens are being coerced into isolation in order to hush the entire operation. DO NOT INVEST IN STOCKS, our market is influencing dealings from Brexit to european terror attacks and even vicious attacks to foreign intelligence communities to draw support against North Korea.

I created a mental networking system of thinking in Victoria, BC and since them I have been extorted, coerced, repeatedly tortured, and detained by my government and Canada's.

I was hit by an SUV and my car totaled, robbed of my guitars and belongings, put in jail twice, brainwashed, and poisoned, made homeless, and stripped of my rights as an American Citizen. My passport has been destroyed, my family has been threatened. I will not stop until the people involved are exposed as war criminals to the general public and put in jail.
All it takes is publicity, they will try to frame me and paint a dirty picture around me. As far as I can tell I am part of a long-term agenda that has been planning a strategic take-down of foreign non-capitalist economies since around the 90's.


post 7:


In Victoria, BC. I discovered time relativity and thinking style algorithms which were then used in accordance with new technology to be communicated and developed into a very scary new method of thinking. Used initially for scientific purposes: DNA studies, relativity flux pattern research, gravitational wavelength studies, and modern theoretical physics.
Then for business and potential investment techniques: stock market analysis, future economy tracking, and influential marketing targeting. 
It was then used for malevolent purposes as well as moral: coercement and blackmail and the exposure of such, as well as documentation of evidence and coordination of guilt and recognition of such. Not to mention long term mental torture in order to subtly influence a violent crime or situation.
I am not happy to say that currently the majority users of my algorithms are corrupt governement officials and intelligence communities who are trying to steal my ideas and creations, technology, and reputation in order to reestablish a stranglehold on world economies. This is akin to a government controlling the technological atmosphere of Earth.
The technology has been used in the Iraq war using time relativity based algorithms i.e. being able to track time at such a precise manner as to communicate to oneself future or past. (intuition is a natural indicator of this skill). Using one's memory one can recall a past conversation and communicate something to another without physical presence involved.
This means that a trained person uninhibited can influence thought externally, even situational outcome and perspective. However, it takes a freedom of will selection from the external party therefore the actions caused are never free will (therefore traceable and punishable).
Since then it has evolved and can quite literally be used for any purpose involving life's movements. There are a plethora of crimes being committed and wrongdoings using this technology and so far my government has been very lax at involving forensics and law enforcement into the freedom of thinking the technology presents itself with.
This means one wielding this technology can cause suicide or murder using another person without said person knowingly agreeing to it. Feeling as if they are going insane, lack of peripherals and manic light thinking is an indicator of this.
My government and Canada's then Britain, Russia, China, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and both North and South Korea and many others have been monitoring this technology due to it's geological control factors involving business and warfare as well as espionage.
I was initially very interested in joining the intelligence community, however after my first dealing with them I decided to turn away and take my invention elsewhere. 
They have since then, stolen and tortured me. Blackmailed, and forced me to commit crimes I did not want to commit.
I am brainwashed every night and I cannot sleep if I refuse to cooperate. (at times I even developed irrational habits and forgot everyday actions like prayer)
If I pray they sexually harass me or close people to my cause, and if I turn to rights groups they vilify me publicly. 
I cannot call a lawyer about it because there is no physical evidence or proof and they are threatening me with blackmail if it ever gets exposed.
If you can understand the situation or are somehow involved please remember every bit of evidence or write it down, save to a usb, or email to a politician whom you know personally face to face.
Do not believe anything in the news or from the internet, our media does not report the truth. There is no straight talk or answers being given as this is a secret war so far.
I know for a fact someone has died because of my actions refusing to bow down to a war effort that's solely monetarily based. I will not stop until my case is clear.
If this escalates I will be forced to turn to military forces elsewhere in politically stable countries.
I am innocent, I have never hurt anyone in my life willingly with full conscious.
I know this because I know my life has had strange things happen without explanation only pointing towards a political agenda and I finally have an explanation.
Thanks.

I found a dirty bomb last week during a crisis the CIA has since covered up. Waking up to gunshots and screams with no help from police. The bomb was planted in a shed across the dirt field from my apartment building across two train tracks I found a series of very incriminating things.
There were a pile of logs and a number of glass containers as well as a trail which looked (almost conspicuously) like a bomb line.
Inside the shed there were two file cabinet sized devices consisting of black boxes with wires each the size of a car battery. About 6 per the two devices.
The shed was giving off heat from the devices and I started sweating.
Since then I have received no word on the situation, there has been no news, and I cannot recall clearly any details regarding the discovery that could pinpoint clearly who and why it was there.
I believe it was planted either by North Korea as a warning to halt the war plans against them and the rising steel-oil funding. Or by my own governement to promote the economic boost a war would present with such.
If I die it was a betrayal against me from the central intelligence community, the MI5, or Cansec (of whom has attempted to poison me in the past)
God is a community of religious people who are more than happy to welcome us into a safe place in this giant debacle.
This includes people with public immunity towards warfare, but does not exclude them from government coersion.
Do not be easily influenced during all of this, notice the agenda's people present themselves afterwards with.
This is highly coordinated and very scary.

41,"I have been a long time sufferer of depression and anxiety. I am well accustomed to what I have to do when I need help and how to help myself overcome anxiety. What is new to me is helping someone else on a daily basis with their depression whilst still making sure I look after mine. 

This is about my partner. Who I love utterly and completely. He has depression and anxiety and this is the first time he has ever had to deal with it. I know how I needed help and have tried suggesting things to him that helped me. I have also been extra mindful in explaining that it's what helped ME, and if it isn't for him then that's ok. The only thing I said he HAD to do was talk to a doctor. Which he has finally and has been prescribed a low does of anti depressant. I need to get him to go back as he says he doesn't feel that different. 

I was really wondering if you guys had any advice -

Men - what did you find helped you? If you were in a relationship what did your partner do that helped, OR what did they do that didn't help? 

Obviously ladies feel free to have your input, I just know that men often deal with it differently, or have a harder time coming to terms with it and speaking about it. 

Any advice at all from anyone would be massively appreciated. 

Also we are in the U.K. If that makes any difference ",09May2017,5
42,Three weeks ago I started losing it I am angry and sad all the time and constantly think about about suicide. I can't sleep at all the closest thing to a good night sleep that I have gotten is probably abut 3 hours but I have only sleeping about an hour then staying up 20-30hours without feeling tired. I can't eat I've only been eating a couple bites of food a day. Yesterday I called my psychologist I see every few weeks because I am worried and she called the police to my house but I smashed my phone andleft and before they arrived and watched them from a park near my apartment for a few hours until they left. I used a payphone and called her again and she told me to come into her and when I got there she forced me to stay then called and ambulance (which I am now stuck with the bill from) I was at the hospital all day but they said they're not concerned. I keep doing bizarre things and don't no why and keep losing my thoughts and they don't make sense. But the doctors don't believe me. I keep thinking about doing something drastic and don't know why. Nothing feels real like I am in a simulation. I'm in Alberta and I don't use drugs. How I get help doctors just tell me they're not concerned that I am going to hurt anybody but ignore everything and are working against me it seems.,09May2017,1
43,"Hi, denizens of r/mentalhealth. Hope this is the right place to post this. I am taking some initiative this year and deciding to represent myself in NAMI's walk in support of mental health services and resources. 

I've learned so much about the conditions that I've been saddled with for many years. PTSD, panic attacks, anxiety, depression, and ADHD have rattled my brain pretty hard at times. It feels so overwhelming to sit with all of the changes my body and my brain throw at me.

I'm proud to say that I have made progress in learning what works for me in order to regulate my emotions a little better. Instead of feeling denial or treatment-resistant, I bit the bullet in learning to accept the realities ad limitations of my illnesses. 

This walk is my way for ME to stand up and represent myself. Stigma has kept me from being taken seriously for so long that only a few close people have any idea of the stuggle I have. Among a crowd of support I can stand as part of a community and walk alongside others who understand.

This is a very symbolic first step in my effort to feel like I can own myself and allow myself to openly feel confident and strong.

Long story short: if my story resonates with you at all, please consider sponsoring me on my donor page. It means so much to see those few names on there and to know that my efforts are recognized. I am important because I have my own voice. I have my own two feet to keep going forward. If you can help in any way, this is the link. https://www.namiwalks.org/participant/marissasangels

45,"I feel like I'm going crazy. I've been super depressed and stressed lately. I wake up in the middle of the night feeling like I was to cry and am all alone. My gf broke up with me 2-3 months ago and I was just starting to feel better about it when she asked me to come over a few weeks ago. I was drunk and said yes and since then we've been seeing each other often if either by coincidence or by choice. Anyways I slept with her a few times in the last few weeks and by accident found out she's been sleeping with other people and even had a one night stand between times we hooked up recently. It made me feel sick to my stomach and ever since then I feel crazy. I told her how I feel and she said sorry I like you but I don't want to be in a relationship with you. Which made me feel even worse. Basically I feel worthless, depressed, sad and on the verges of feeling suicidal. This last weekend I asked to sleep at her house because I was worried about myself being alone. I admitted to her that I had been thinking there's only one way out. She showed genuine concern which made me feel better but still didn't help as the next night she went out with friends and when she got back to her place and woke me up I had a mental breakdown. I seriously thought she needed to take me to psych ward. She eventually fell asleep to me going crazy but I laid awake for who knows how long. In the morning I still felt alone even though she was right there. I felt that way all day at work and then she asked if I still needed to talk. So I left work early and went on a hike with her. I begged her to take me back and she said no I need to deal with this thing on my own and it's not attractive to be like this. She said I need to grow stronger and learn how to deal with my emotions. As well as work on my goals in life before she'd consider getting back together with me and even then she doesn't think we're right for each other. I have similar feeling I just miss her comfort. 



Anyways I've been feeling like I'm on the edge of a breakdown for a few weeks now. Work is difficult but I power through it. I am the only person who can do my job so it stresses me out knowing if I went away they'd be fucked. What should I do I go to a social anxiety group and talk to a therapist but they seem to think I just have general anxiety. ",09May2017,3

49,"So. This is my first serious post. Ever, I think. 

I need to reach out to new people who may be able to help me and my current situation, with a few gems of wisdom. If there is anything, be it just a single piece of advice, please don't shy away from replying. I'm an open book for all feedback. Especially at the moment. 

My best friend of seven years and now boyfriend of eleven months is depressed, to be blunt. He recently started therapy after school but he hasn't really adapted to the sessions he attends and therefore expresses a bit of discomfort towards opening up to his therapist. His depression, when speculating our relationship in its entirety, is new to me. I want to be as great a comforter as I can be for him. I would love nothing more than to have him smile again and truly mean it. And I know that in his mind, he may feel that such a thing as a smile is unachievable. 

[I] So a little bit of context about what influenced me to write this post: my boyfriend's depression has yet to be diagnosed but the trends of his behaviour are very familiar when comparing his current state to my own from my high school days. While I cannot confirm that he is absolutely depressed, I firmly believe it. We will call my boyfriend ‘C’. C has always been a bit of a goober. He used to go out of his way to make anybody laugh, whether or not they needed it. His form of comedic talent was always very goofy or very dry. He's extremely witty and that is just one of many things I love about him. He could turn an entire spat on its head and he is always the first I have to turn to when I am upset; not by choice but instead because he could always sense when something was off. We didn't start dating until we had been friends for six whole years. I feel kind of terrible actually, because five of those, he admitted, he was in love with me. He didn't tell me this until just shy of one year ago, and then we started dating. Being with him is something I won't ever get enough of; he gives my life colour. C completes me, and I would not have it any other way than his. I love him. 

[II] Fast forward to early March when /this/ began. I describe it as /this/ because it was so unexpected. The boy who could make everybody else laugh had forgotten how to do it himself. 
C began to show slow, gradual releases of pain and hurting, something he had the tendency of hiding from not only myself but his family. His mother plays a huge role in supporting him emotionally because of his circumstances and how he was raised, and that is something I can respect. But C began to withdraw his thoughts and feelings from conversation. He hasn't been entirely ‘human’ since all of this began. Instead, he just speaks in monotones and insults. He tries, he really does, to put on a brave face. But I can see that he is cracking. And I worry more and more that one day, I will lose him to the monster inside his head. 

[III] Current date. I was on the phone to him roughly an hour or so ago before he went to therapy, where he is currently, and there was a moment. What I heard from him was something I had never heard before. He began to have a panic attack. My blood was boiling and my stomach twisted itself in fear of what I was listening to. He was having a mental breakdown, and for the first time in the relationship we have, I did not know what I could do to help. I insisted he take deep breaths and I was desperately looking for a way to comfort him. After he calmed himself, he began to cry. I did what I could to be strong as he poured his heart out to me; all of his thoughts. How the idea of self inflicted harm and even suicide has become all the more common in his mind. How he cries himself to sleep at night and how he believes the only things keeping him here are his mother and myself. How he goes to an all boys school, where it's forbidden socially to show any sign of weakness. How he only feels alive by doing dangerous ordeals that could put his health at risk. 

The side I saw to him tonight was not my boyfriend. I saw his demons. 

So I suppose, the question begging is, how do I speak to him? Not in general, but about his condition? How can I make him feel good to be alive? 

Speak from personal experiences if you'd like, or provide a few pointers in general. Anything will be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ♥︎ ",09May2017,1
50,"I have been a reddit user for a short while now and have finally decided to utilize the resources here. There is a lot I did not post about myself but I write poorly enough as it is so I figured I wouldn't go too long. 

I was recently diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and am working on meditating/mindfulness to help when I feel it creeping on. A few years ago I was given an SSRI coupled with Trazodone at night for a diagnosis of depression. This therapist for the most part focused on my suicidal thoughts (at this point I had already fabricated an entire story about rat poison and it involved phone calls, hospitalization, letters to friends, seriously messed up shit that I don’t feel remorse over but can recognize as being absolutely bat shit). She told me my it seemed I had vengeful thoughts when it came to ending my life. For the most part it was in retaliation to someone I had thought wronged me and how it would affect their life if I did. She wasn’t wrong. 

 Both diagnoses feel incomplete or lacking in some form. I agree that I have symptoms found in both GAD as well as Persistent depressive d/o but they do not touch base on a few things I may have glossed over (still mentioned to my therapist but he didn't go into depth with me) during my counseling.

-It was brought to my attention that all growing up I considered myself a teacher's pet because I did so well in class but I was certainly not a favorite like I believed I was. I was often sent out of class for disrupting the lesson, sat ""on the bench"" during recess/lunch for misbehavior (sometimes for insulting other kids but often for doing something bad and lying about it to the yard duty and subsequently getting caught in the lie) and for the most part I was able to wiggle my way out of trouble with a smile and a white lie. 

Since my younger school days, I have moved on from angry outbursts and trouble making. I keep things hidden and ""kill them with kindness"". I actively seek the expected reaction/interaction and work myself into what is needed. I realized that getting in trouble got me nowhere and I had to be more careful with my lies and anger issues.
 The rate at which I stole from stores increased and with it my ability to fabricate stories grew. In college, I started dating a girl to keep my homosexual identity hidden and for a year I played along with the relationship. During that time, if I am being honest with myself, I truly developed some identity issues. I learned to manipulate and control those around me to continue this false identity I had created. Those who knew me heard stories of violent parents and a past with drug (heroine) abuse. As my story began to get too difficult to handle and my relationship was getting to a point where I was trapped with a female, I ran away to a new college and began to rack up sizeable credit debt and was found ""unreliable"" at a few jobs even though my supervisors loved me. The mormon lifestyle I lead before crumbled to hookups, Drug abuse (MDMA, Ecstasy, LSD, research drugs of all sorts, 2-FMA, 4-HOMPT, alcohol and marijuana),   I continued my stories and dug an even deeper hole in a new location. After a few years of gaining and losing friends I got to the point where I was alone and due to all of the lies and convoluted backstory that was my past I had no one. I moved again, fabricated a backstory at my new store and have already begun digging that hole again. (I'll cut out some of the details to keep it shorter) I found a man that loves me and I have come to the realization that love is not something I am familiar with. I have done things all my life in a manner that would keep me in a positive light not to win affection of people. He has pointed out that apologizing is the last thing on my mind when I am in the wrong. I will lie till deaths door even when confronted with someone who knows I am lying. The tears and the apologies are all a means to an end and he is beginning to realize it. He tells me he is worried because he has seen me ""cry on a dime"" when all my conniving and worming out of a situation had been exhausted. Hot tempered and irrational are another few words that could be used to describe me. He is not wrong. I am disconnected from my emotions in a manner that I feel should be scary but in the end, it doesn't bother me. There is no guilt when I get online ""chat"" with other. There is no guilt from stealing. Anxiety comes from the possibility of being caught, being exposed. My current therapist says it all stems from a survival instinct I developed having to hide my identity as a homosexual. The lies and deceitful nature I tend towards are a product of my desire to produce what I believed society wanted to see.
