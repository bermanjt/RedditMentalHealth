0,"I haven't slept properly for 2 months. Yeah you heard it. I haven't had a good nights sleep since december and I think I'm going crazy.

Basically I try to get in bed at the same time every day but I just cannot fall asleep no matter how tired I am. I fall asleep really late, like 4-5 hours after I've gone to bed and it frustrates the shit out me because then I only sleep 2-3 hours maximum.

I'm working full time so I come to work every day feeling like a zombie and I hate it. My mood has worsened and I'm withdrawing from family and friends and have no energy to do anything. I have anxiety and it has only gotten worse.

I have tried sleeping pills you get over the counter and they do nothing. I was at the doctor and he refused to prescribe me real sleeping pills for some reason.

Please help I'm going fully crazy soon",31Jan2017,1

4,"So a year ago I got over my xanax addiction and since then I have been super motivated; exercising putting in the work for my film making dreams. Though last month I hit a wall and started using cocaine and drinking a lot, eventually I got my act together and this was followed by an insane amount of productivity. I find myself now back in this regime using a cocaine multiples times daily, not accomplishing anything and feeling very depressed. I know that I most likely have addiction issues, but was curious whether this may have psychological roots?

9,"the other night i was standing in the doorway of my bedroom and looking into the hall and i was like frozen and it felt like my house had changed. it was like it was a dream. i went downstairs and i went into the bathroom and i looked at my face and it got all blurry and the light was like swirling around with it and i saw someone else's face as part of my face. i looked like a monster. like a human monster though. it felt like i was moving the face in the mirror with my face. bending the light and the mirror. it was really strange. i had my first panic attack in a while the next day. it was while i was driving and everthing was pretty overwhelming so i parked in a random parking lot so i wouldn't like crash and walked the rest of the way to work. idk maybe it wasn't a panic attack i really don't know but essentially i get really nervous about seeing certain people when i go out and i hyperventilate and have trouble moving properly. everything gets blurry. (CW:pedophilia/human trafficking for this part) one time i was like half unconcious from the lack of O2, due to hyoerventilating, i guess and i kept thinking i was 6 and i was being sold to pedophiles online when i was able to move again i decided to take some oxycodone i had leftover from when i got my wisdom teeth out. basically i fell guilty like i am making too much out of normal feelings or faking these occurrences lmao.

10,"I got diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety with social phobia in November of 2014 after becoming suicidal. The doctors put my on fluoxetine (Prozac) which made me worse to the point where I actually attempted. That led to me being put onto Sertraline (Zoloft). Over the last 18 months, I've had several dosage adjustments leading me to maxing out the dosage for this medication with seemingly no improvement on my mental health. If anything, it appears to have gotten worse. 

The cycle goes as follows: 

- Gets medication dosage increased
- Gradually start to feel better 
- (couple of months pass) Slowly start to feel worse 
- Suddenly reach a whole new level of depression 
- Becomes suicidal 
- Repeat 

That cycle has been my life since I got diagnosed. The first dosage adjustment was around 10 months after I started taking the medication. The latest has been a month and a half. Over time, I think my tolerance to the sertraline has increased causing it to stop working much more rapidly than before. 

What do I do now though? I've maxed out the dosage. Will my doctor prescribe me something additional to take with the medication I'm already on or will I have to start from scratch with a new medication and hope it works? What if nothing will ever work and I'm stuck in this cycle for the rest of my life? I don't think I could take it. 

Has anyone ever gone into recovery without seeing a counsellor, therapist or psychiatrist? Is it even possible? I can't see any of those, so I am strictly limited to medication unless I ever get sectioned. My social phobia prevents me from speaking to strangers. It also prevents me from speaking to my family about my problems due to an incessant worry that I'm bothering them. This leaves me to my own thoughts with my only confidant being my extremely caring doctor who has been working with me since I got diagnosed. The occasional online post such as this one helps too. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I just want to find a way to end this cycle without having to speak to anyone official, so that I can go out and live the life I wanted.

11,"So far, my depression is fairly under control, and I would say it is definitely way better then it has been in the past. That being said I still have like these moments of fake 'clarity' that basically make me feel really unsatisfied with some of the people I'm friends with. I feel like I try to stay in touch with people I don't see very often because I consider them good friends and they also consider me a close friend but like they just kind of never reach out, or only do so when it seems like I'm having a great time (Through social media or whatever.) It's kind of frustrating because part of me feels like I am mad at my friends for not trying to talk to me more if they say they want to be like good life long friends, but another part of me realizes that I am being too critical and obviously people get busy with their daily lives because I do too. 

That's also how I feel with my depression in general, like one half of myself is like this pessimistic person and the other half is trying to calm me down and be realistic and I just end up exhausted.

I think I maybe feeling this way though because I probably have built up a tolerance to my medication, I plan to see my doctor but I don't even get to see my therapist about these issues very often because lack of time. I just don't know what to even think! I feel like I'm just losing friends, like real friends, not just people I'm friendly to at school like just genuine friendships where we both want to make time to hang out with and talk to each other.

I hope this is just the medication thing otherwise I think I'm turning into a huge fucking loser, I started eating lunch alone because I just feel like I don't have any friends or groups that would want to include me or I would want to be included in.

17,"Over the past 6 months or so I have started to notice that I have been becoming very worried about forgetting if I actually did what I was going to do or if I'm just remembering another time.

For example something as small as flushing the toilet, I have to do something strange to make the act of flushing the toilet actually be remembered by me. I'll sometimes say out loud something like ""the toilet is flushed"" to make some sort of unique memory so when I think back to whether or not I did was I was supposed to do, I actually have memory of doing it.

This happens with a lot of things, locking doors, turning off lights, turning off stoves, etc. If I dont do something unique or something to stand out I could become obsessed with the thought of whether or not I actually did it and it wont be relieved until I go and check to see if I did it and then do something unique so I remember it this time.

This has become a pretty big annoyance in my life and I dont want it to get any worse. Not sure if its something like OCD or maybe just bad anxiety. If anyone has some insight on my problem or have experienced anything like it before and has input I would greatly appreciate it.",31Jan2017,2

But than on Saturday night in the middle of fairly normal (for us) sex with my boyfriend I suddenly remembered something the man had said to me last February and I remebered it in his voice. I saw his face for a second and jt felt the same. I pushed my boyfriend off asking him to stop (he did right away) and tried to explain why. I said ""I just remembered something"" and before I could say anything else I just broke down, right there in his bed. He covered me up and held me and tried to comfort me but I couldn't stop crying. I kept saying things. 'I'm sorry' 'why didn't I report it?' 'Why did he do it?' Ect. I realized I can't even say the R word. I can't even type it here, notice my overcomplicated wording up top. I can't call myself a victim out loud and I obviously haven't worked though this.
My boyfriend was great about it. He just held me and told me its going to be ok and not to be sorry. When I finally calmed down enough to talk to him I asked him to hand me my clothing and not look while I got dressed and to get dressed himself. He did this without question but I can't figure out why after haveing slept with this man so many times in the past it is suddenly bugging me now. He didn't so much as touch me until I told him it was ok too and that took me until the next night (we are normally a very active couple). 
It took about 8 or 9 months after the incident for me to have sex again in the first place. Now I'm always worried this will happen again. I don't want to relive this. What is happening to me? I want to enjoy my boyfriends company again. Please help!",31Jan2017,6
20,"

My most recent run of bad luck in losing my job, and this break down in the aftermath, has me questioning whether I can really take care of myself properly. And if I can't, what am I supposed to do?  
  
The first few nights afterward I had terrible nightmares and after that I haven't been able to get to sleep until I'm absolutely exhausted and don't have a choice. Usually somewhere around 5 in the morning now. I sleep late because of that and find myself panicking over the thought of job hunting right now. I am an absolute mess. Just getting my work done for classes is taking every bit of energy out of me that isn't spent worrying about my financial state.  
  
I am 26 and have been on mood stabilizers sense the age of 13. I was assaulted at that age and after apparently never dealing with it and other incidents properly, PTSD warped into my current state of what I am told is probably Borderline Personality Disorder. But sense they arrived at that last conclusion after years of medicating me for so many other disorders, I've always taken the judgment with a grain of salt.  
  
The last time I was hospitalized was almost exactly 2 years ago. For a stent of a week. I've always hated the time I spend in the hospital because I know I don't have the money to be missing work or paying the bill. Now it seems I've just developed an outright phobia because the hospital setting has been in my nightmares too.  
  
I moved from my parents house in August to a town four hours away to finish up my degree. I wanted so badly to be able to be on my own and I feel like my world is falling down around me because of it. I had had to move back in with my parents after my best friend and I had a rather large fright and she announced that I was absolutely impossible to live with or even be around any more. That was devastating in itself so I'm sure I wanted to leave town because of that too.  
  
Now I'm in a place where I'm completely frightened that I might have tried to do too much. But I can't expect anyone to take care of me. My family doesn't have the means. I felt like I had to at least try to do something for myself.  
  
I need to formulate some sort of plan to make it to May here where I am, until I can move back home and figure the rest out. But I have no energy and my fear of absolutely everything makes me break down in stupid little fits a couple times a day. I'm not always this way, all whining and scared. But any time I feel like I'm not safe in some way, I tend to be so irrational. I have enough savings to get me through next month. I should be calmly looking for a job right now.  
  
I need advice on any little things I can do to make myself feel better enough to get out and do the things I need to do to keep my life together right now.  ",31Jan2017,3
21,"I do not know if this is the correct subreddit to be asking for/talking about what is happening to me, so I do apologise if   it's incorrect.

Hey everyone, I am an 18 year old male and I am seriously debating if I suffer from some sort of mental illness or is there something else to it. Over the past few months I have started to feel like I am no longer a human. What I mean by that is that everything I do is like a task and a cycle I have to do everyday. Days become vague, I don't even feel time anymore, I lose the grip of the moment and when I do something, I think back about it and realise I wasn't my fully self during that moment. It's like I literally can't feel the moment while the moment is happening. I tend to think and question a lot about my past and it's very difficult for me to let go of what already happened. I have been suffering from depression for about 4 years now if that may have some relevance to the feelings and thoughts I am experiencing. Soon it will be a 1 year anniversary with my current girlfriend. She was my first while I was her 5th. At the beginning of the relationship that didn't really bother me until as of now. I don't know if that is normal and what should I do, but it is not healthy and I want to know what you think about my whole situation.

Thanks a lot.

In conclusion, I feel like
-Time is going way too fast
-I cannot LIVE the moment
-I feel like I am a slave to my body, I do stuff without even thinking about them
-No motivation to do anything and everything is very difficult to do
-One minute I love my girlfriend the other I do not
-Losing the touch with reality",31Jan2017,3

23,"Hi

I have been **suffering from OCD for the past 2 years,** I have been on medication for the past 6 to 7 months and during this time my intrusive thoughts have reduced considerably, I still do get thoughts every day but none of them are too violent and I have a great deal of control over them.

But over the **past 2 weeks my thought frequency has increased** to a certain extent (definitely not as high as before) and apart from that, I am having a **bit of trouble sleeping while having a few scary instances in the middle of the night.**

I usually have some dream or vision which **I forget within 2 to 3 seconds** and I don't think the dream lasted for long either, as far as I remember the dream started for a few seconds and I woke up immediately after that, these are some of the instances I remember well,

1) I am half awake and all of a sudden **I see someone sitting on my sofa** which is opposite to my bed, I get scared and realize that **he is actually one of the robbers who had entered my house** that night, 2 seconds later I realize that **he is actually a guest who had come for a family gathering** in my house and feel bad that I am sleeping when there are guests at home, **after 3 to 4 seconds I realize that there is no person on my sofa, just my bag (which looks nothing like a person).**

2) Again I have some dream which **I forget within 1 or 2 seconds** of waking up, I am still half asleep when **I see a large object outside my window,** I realize that **two people are stealing something** from our balcony and start feeling anxious, but just **2 to 3 seconds later** I realize that it is actually a calendar hung in front of my window which is actually inside my room. 

3) This time my **aunt came into my room** and asked me to wake up, I realized that it was already **5 AM (my usual wake up time)** so I started getting up, but when I checked why my alarm didn't ring on my phone, I noticed that the **time was 3:37 AM,** the same on my watch as well, after nearly 20 to 30 seconds I realize that my aunt did not enter my room.

**Aftermath**

Usually, after getting such dreams I find it **difficult to get back to sleep for at least 5 to 10 minutes,** I am scared to close my eyes and to sleep on my sides, so I sleep straight and cautiously close my eyes while waking up for even the slightest noise.

This is weird because some of them aren't even scary, I don't remember most of them, so I have no idea why I feel anxious and scared at that point!

**Let me know if anyone has experienced something like this.**",31Jan2017,1
24,"i'm about to sound insane but please believe me i'm aware of it. also, i'll pathetically ask for you guys not judge me too hard or mock me.

i have depression and anxiety. it was kept in check for a long while, then in 2012 i started a relationship when i knew i shouldn't have, and my mental health began deteriorating again. through 2012 to 2015 i was in hell, and my partner of course left me. i then fell into this huge breakup depression coupled with the clinical depression i carry with me all the time. end of 2016, i decided to put an end to this struggle, and began to let go of everything that was hurting me. it worked, i felt like myself again, like the me before 2012. except i wasn't.

for some reason, while i am feeling better than i was, my anxiety has increased out of nowhere. i keep finding things to worry about: my pets health, my parents health, if someone i love doesn't answer the phone, i think tragedy right away and get frentic and call until they pick up, if my pets prefer to go to sleep instead of playing with me, i think they're sick or they hate me even though i know they're fine and healthy, but i keep driving myself crazy over it. before them, i lost two pets out of nowhere and it scarred me forever, so i know when i see my current pets that fear just comes back.

my point is: i'm scared of losing the ones i love, and after being left by the man i was in love with, this fear only increased.

that's not so bad, right? it's unhealthy but hey, it's part of the illness. okay.

now here's the part i tell you i'm sick to my stomach today and wanting to cry my eyes out because i found out that my favorite character's fate in a game was left in a twist ending and i won't know what happens until august because of a dlc that will explain the rest of the story. on top of that, they might have changed his model.

i am freaking out. i am scared of the possible outcomes for this character fate as if he's a real person. i am, of course, aware that he's not real, but it's gut wrenching and the wait is even worse.

here's the funny bit: i freaked out about the same thing back in 2012 when he starred in a game that year. 2012 was the year that i began falling apart.

i'm crying because i know this is insane and i swear i don't want to feel like this, but i am and i'm not understanding why. why am i so attatched? why am i feeling like this? i need something, anything. people around me are asking me questions, why am i so upset? and the thing is, i cry about the character and then i cry about everything's that has gone wrong in my life so far.

i tried booking a session but they told me to try next month. i don't know what to do. please, any kind soul who can maybe explain to me why i'm so messed up why a character means this much, anyone who can offer me a way to get over this, i'll take it. i'm going insane. ",31Jan2017,8

28,"So I'm struggling to know what to do - I have finally dealt with my depression in a way that has made it much more manageable (TMS - no medication did anything but make my depression worse) but a problem remains. 

My husband keeps telling me I view reality in a way that is skewed that he thinks is what keeps pushing me back into depression because I view things as worse than they are and take things too personally. I see a therapist and do mindfulness practice, but I still see things the way I do, but I am starting to agree with him because I'll get very upset over something like a take conversation that I view as negative, yet when my husband reads it and tells me what he thinks actually is the situation, he always ends up being right. I'm starting to fee crazy because I don't understand how I can misread situations so badly and I don't know how to work on this.

Does anyone know what this would be called, if anything, and ways to improve? It's miserable to constantly feel like people are upset with me when it turns out they aren't, or to think a situation went badly or is unfixable and turn out to have totally misjudged it. My husband is mostly understanding but I can tell he's getting sick of having to explain to me why I should stop crying or stop feeling rejected over things and he's told me sometimes he feels like I'm intentionally lying about situations to be the victim and get his attention.

So basically my mum takes at least 10 ,possibly up to 20, laxatives a day but eats fairly normally and drinks loads (non-alcoholic!) so more of an addiction rather than an eating disorder I think??

Is this even a problem?? She won't talk about it whatsoever or even accept it so...? There's not a lot I can do but I know if something ever does happen because of this I'll feel guilty for not trying to do something??? Help?! Like on the outside she seems like a completely unaffected person...

37,"   Having been at both ends of the spectrum in regards to the message that my t.v is directly communicating with me, I find myself wondering, that if on some scale it is surely constantly stating its point of view on my life.

   When it is directly commanding action, maybe with religious overtones, you can be a demon trapped in hell. Trapped in Hell with the belief that you have enormous control over the universe. Control that can be executed with a mere thought, but you dare not. For you and the television both know that to act is to lose this game, this struggle, this dance with madness that sees you desperately trying to find a path back to heaven. While your brain intercepts the last shreds of reality and joyfully twists them to suit the psychosis, the narrative can continue unchecked. You learn to think like the T.V.  It becomes an extension of your thought, finishing every sentence, echoing every impulse, every emotion. It's not so much that it is telling you what to do, but every image absolutely reinforces your thought process. The heavens thunder with the pulse of your heart, and the beauty of insanity shines out from every pore.

   Sometimes it is simply paranoia. Although paranoia is never simple in the minds of the paranoid, and can often include quite an exciting premise. One of my favourites was always the intergalactic television show. This glorious production, in which all matter and consciousness in the universe is watching you for some sort of entertainment, literally an intergalactic television show. The world is your stage, and nothing you can possibly do has any more consequences than anything that you might see on regular television. This makes the action sequences quite a bit more dangerous and troublesome to the police, but overall it's a great time. You don't usually see and converse with complete beings that aren't there during extreme paranoia, but the television serves as a great medium to convey your instructions, on just what it is your supposed to do in this grand play. Lots of talking to trees, directing traffic with a stick, dressing up in various military and martial arts costumes, acting out characters you have read about in the bible, seen on T.V programs...you know the usual behaviours.

   Somewhere in the realm of normal exists a basic commentary on your everyday life. I mean, I am an ordinary creature doing ordinary things, and the television is about ordinary creatures doing ordinary things...so it makes perfect logical sense that at certain points those things are going to line up. It is not always a sign of mental instability when something that just occurred to you, occurs on the television at the exact moment you happen to be thinking about it. It is not always an episode, when the episode of your favourite sitcom happens to be detailing exactly the situation that your going through. Or that movies you were not previously aware of seem to mimic in great detail a narrative that your life has been following..... But sometimes it is.

   Sometimes your struggling with an even greater injustice. One to that shield of self righteousness the mind has set up to guard your ego from disagreeing entities in your story.  Sometimes when the morning staff unlocks the door to your solitary room, the door to the back....the door with the small window through which the other patients peek at you as they shamble past on their wild walks.......Sometimes the television doesn't talk to you. I can't hear a thing......and that fat bastard won't give me the remote because I yelled at him for taking away my cigarettes...........end",31Jan2017,2

Don't get me wrong these sort of behaviours have been average for me, but it has seemed to worsen over time.

I understand the huge disparity between reality and fantasy and that some sexual desires are taboo or socially unacceptable, but healthy to have. Still, I'm not sure if MINE, in particular, would be considered average or abnormal. If my fantasies indicate an underlying issue, they're probably due to my insecurity, loneliness, need for control, sexual frustration, or just melancholy. In my ideal dreams, my partner would not be able to react negatively, so I can just project my affection to them without any objections. I don't know how to express my love for people in real life. I perform and excel at my absolute potential at school, which contributes to my lack of any social life and ""loner"" image. I'm often ignored or excluded by my peers because they assume I'm unfriendly. In reality, I can't express my feelings properly and am partially timid and shy. However, I'm a benign, yet socially awkward teen. I don't want to hurt anyone nor make people angry at me. Also, my parents and environment have no part in this. I come from a hospitable, loving family and household.Though, sometimes I have to force myself to act normal, especially when I'm actually distressed internally. In those cases, I would cry over loneliness or hopeless longing whilst alone. Needless to say, I prefer to keep to myself and not share my thoughts. Once again, I don't know how these sexually deviant thoughts formed nor why they only include girls, never boys. I've never attempted to harm anyone or anything, though I find it difficult to empathize at times. I'm always fidgeting, smiling, or giggling around other girls, but not guys, except for an occasional smile. I can forget these fantasies for a brief period, but they eventually return even stronger.  Once again, I AM A TEENAGE GIRL. NOT A GUY!",31Jan2017,0
42,"Hello,

I was put on Depakote (valproate) after a load of other meds failed. I suffer from severe depression, moodswings and anxiety. I started off with 300 mg daily and am now taking 900 mg daily (prolonged release version).

It has been two months now, and I notice no effects yet whatsoever. I still experience moodswings to an extreme degree and my lows are still so bad reaching the point at which I get intrusive suicide thoughts.

Has anyone ever been on Depakote? What was your dosage? What did you notice? When did you first start to notice anything difference? Did you experience any side-effects?

Please note that I am not bipolar, in contrary to the majority of people taking this med. I was given an anticonvulsant as my psychiatrist simply has little options left.

Thanks!",31Jan2017,1
43,"After reading about a thousand posts on the mental health, mental illness, self-harm, adult survivors, anxiety, depression, PTSD and BPD subreddits through the conceptual filters of 10 years of post-grad education in neurobiology, psychopharmacology, addictive behaviors, social psychology and about 30 types of psychotherapy; I'm pretty convinced that STRESS is at the bottom of about 90% of the ""complaints"" I have seen. 

Further (and because I get to see and hear the same sort of thing out here in the ""physical"" world), I'm just about convinced that 65 to 75% of those 1,000 complaints would be manageable if the *current* (as opposed to traumatic event or early life) stressors of living in the material world without adequate skills and resources were corrected. In many cases, I agree that remedial work for the ""terrifying event"" or early life trauma *is* necessary, but sense very clearly that if the *present* day stress is not greatly reduced, all the therapy in the world will not accomplish much. 

Much of the stress in our lives is self-induced as the result of using coping mechanisms that don't jibe well with things the way they are and not the way they are not. One can pick up more effective coping mechanisms from the various ""skills training therapies"" like the cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking,  and Schema Therapy; as well as the ""super"" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). 

But trying to use those skills when one continues to be committed to trying to run an *exhausting* daily marathon against the challenges of work, family, exercise, recreational drugs, social drinking, pseudo-spirituality and/or continual social media-tion, forces the autonomic nervous system into relentless, unrelieved [fight, flight or freeze](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=fight+flight+freeze), which is a surefire formula for inducing [complex post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=c-ptsd). Because C-PTSD is what I see all over the place, both here, and in the physical world of mental ""health"" (not).  

I use a compilation of the cognitive and mindfulness-based, ""super""-cognitive therapies called the [10 StEPs of Emotion Processing](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing) to keep me from slipping back into the (truly *awful*) C-PTSD I had for nine years from '94 to '03, because I have enough experience with all of the others listed above to be able to do so. But I had to start somewhere, and suggest that others who *start somewhere* with those nine therapies will ultimately get to where they will stop buying into all of the crass, self-destructive rat-racing most of us do because of all the caca we bought from the Commercial Culture of the [Consensus Trance](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+for+Recovery+from+the+Consensus+Trance).

44,"Sorry for the quotations, I am not sure how to explain everything.

I have no idea how to describe it, but before that a bit of background I am a 16 year old male.

Roughly a year ago I would go through a sudden feeling of understanding who I am. Not in the sense of knowing my purpose but literally knowing who I am. 

A way to describe it is, you know who you are. Your age, weight, height, daily routine and family. You automatically know who you are its just normal innit well for me this would sometimes hit suddenly at any time any place and I would just stare off processing my thoughts. It is as if I was an alien replacing a human but suddenly receiving all the memories and thoughts of that human but I would know (or at least feel) that I wasn't me before this experience. All the people around me, when I look at them I would then suddenly realise new features about them, that they have a slightly rigid nose, long eyelashes etc. But I know inside that I knew they had these before but I didn't know the specifics.

Well at first I would get this maybe twice or thrice a week and they were intense. I would suddenly become emotional and break down and go and hug my sisters, kiss my parents and send appreciation texts to my friends. I have a history of depression and suicidal thoughts so whenever I did this people would sometimes get worried and think I might go and do something stupid but the way I would feel is intensely happy and mind blown like I had uncovered a secret to the universe.

Now this happens really quite frequently maybe someday multiple times a day but the emotions are not as intense usually, sometimes it would feel intense but most of the time its just a feeling of now understand everything. And every single time I would feel like the person before ""me"" didn't realise who they were them self and that the new me had just uncovered the truth. It drives me a little crazy but I put up with it but today is when I started getting worried. 

I have been feeling ill the past few days and yesterday when I came home at about 4 I went straight to bed and slept until about 6 but I  was still feeling ill so I didn't go to school. At around 7:30 my mum woke up and greeted and me and when I looked at her she looked different, something was off her face was slightly less long and more wide which made me feel weird. I then went to the toilet since I was feeling sick and looked in the mirror and when I saw myself I felt really queasy. I saw someone who looked a bit like me, like if you compared what I saw and what I look like you think that we were related or something, the person I saw had a quite a bit longer face and facial features, smaller eyes and ears that went in a bit more. I started to feel dizzy and stared at my new face and was just feeling really weird. I stood outside and just took a bit of time to recover and when I looked back in the mirror my face was normal again and my mum looked the same as before but I didn't feel the same again. 

Later I had one of my moments, around 2:00, where I realised who I was bla bla bla but not quite mild and didn't pay attention but this whole experience has been stressing me out. 

Some other information is I suffer a bit of anxiety and just don't feel mentally fit in general, especially around Winter. Doc says I likely have S.A.D. I have taken small amounts of weed twice in the past few weeks, first time didn't feel anything and the second time I didn't much. I also have a history of codeine, 450mg once a week but I am stopping since I know I can't keep this up.

I was wondering if anyone knows what the hell is happening, I will be seeing my doctor again sometime this week.

EDIT: After reading the sidebar I can relate so depersonalization/derealization but also the complete opposite.",31Jan2017,1
