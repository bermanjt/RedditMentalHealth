1,"Disclaimer: The title is the best tl;dr you're gonna get. 

So, let's start with the beginning: my mother's father was an alcoholic with angry outburst directed at 2 out the 3 kids he had with this narcissistic woman (With most likely some Asperger's mixed in there) he married for superficial reasons and who was to become my grandmother. She is currently starving herself to death because she has too many wrinkles. This wonderful father also almost raped the oldest of his daughters.

All the three children they had grew up to be emotionally unstable with one of them even getting a very bad schizophrenic psychosis she passed to her own daughter.

Not surprisingly, my mother lived a messed up life even after her father's death. Hitting it with the wrong crowd that culminated in my eldest brother's father making a drunken mistake and raping my mother when they were in their early 20s. 

With her young child, my mother rushed into a marriage with an abusive drunk, with whom she had another son. This marriage ended when my mother took her sons with her to the streets after her husband threw her into a bookshelf hard enough to break it. 

Couple years later she met my father - a silent, well-behaved man with an upbringing of a very proud and emotionally detached family. When my father's father died, no one cried at the funeral. The priest was confused.

So here we have the wonderful combination of my parents; an emotionally unstable mother who has ADHD (Don't really know where that came from, tbh.),  a bad case of past issues and a habit of escaping into her head when she got anxious, so that she didn't see what her kids got to. One time she did this, my brothers locked me into a cupboard, leaving me with a fear of closed spaces. And her husband whose part in upbringing was to give monetary support. Oh, and who also doesn't allow himself to feel anything unless he's drunk. (I sense a pattern.)

This combo had two daughters, who never really learned to respect their parents. And this is my family: A mother, a (step-)father and 4 kids. My sister, the youngest of us, is the most normal. She has only inherited the detached approach to anything emotional. The rest of us, however, are pretty messed up. 

My brothers have ADHD, and the three of us were bullied throughout school. Two of us have violent outbursts, so we stay clear from alcohol. One of my brothers has Asperger's. He also sometimes has funny hallucinations that don't bother him much. I have the misfortune of having inherited the negative aspects of hallucinations and delusions. I have to have music or tv on to be able to sleep at night. 

 I have an over-active brain and I am hyperalert 24/7 - meaning I wake up constantly even when I'm sleeping. I think this has given me an amazing imagination, so I am also grateful for it. I have a grave need to control all aspects of my life, which causes me to manipulate people and to keep even my closest people from ever knowing me fully. Once when I tried to talk to a psychologist, she didn't realize what I was doing there as my need to control her image of me made me tell her nothing but lies. I lie often, but I think that's the storyteller in me wanting to be heard. 

My loving mother is always telling me how I live on the brink of psychosis everyday and seems to be just waiting for the day I break. Although honestly, if I ever came close to it, I wouldn't tell her, because her emotional instability has taught me and my siblings to never be honest with her. 

Yeah, I don't know what is wrong with me. I have all these inheritable burdens as well as mistrust towards other people I gained in my school days. I can't get involved with people, and I don't know if I am even able to love or if it's just the need to have control. I thought I was in love once, but that only happened when my best friend got into a serious relationship, so it could have been just possessiveness. 

Oh well, this rant is long enough as it is. And very hard to follow, I know, since my thoughts kept bouncing while I typed. I just had to get this out there, since I have never told anyone this entire story and I needed to do something to not feel as out of control as I was when I started this post.

5,"I want to start off with saying I am in no way an expert, in no way qualified, and you should always seek professional help with regards to mental health.

However

In my own personal experience I've found that it's always good to talk about whatever is on your mind, even if it doesn't seem to be related to any problems you're having.

It's also sometimes really good to listen to others about their struggles, it can even give you a bit of a jumpstart or inspiration on what's going on with yourself.

Half the battle is actually being aware of what's wrong and then trying to understand why.

I'm not 100% sure why I'm posting this, but if it makes even one person slightly more positive or gives them a little boost in the long run then I'll be a very happy man.

6,"27 yr old female here. I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression.

I maintain my outward appearance very well. On the daily I shower, stylize my hair, wear makeup, maintain my nails, take care of my skin, wear my clothes without stains / rips / wrinkles, and don my jewelry.

On the flip side... My home looks like it has exploded. I have not cleaned a damn thing since the summer. Dishes in the sink from the summer... clothes on the floor since the summer... dust piles the size of my foot... mildew coating the walls of my bathroom... 

This isn’t because I’m lazy. It drives me fucking nuts because I like being clean. 

When I’m at home all I do is lay in bed and cry. It is so exhausting pretending to be functioning human being that I do not have the energy to maintain my home. 

I am so embarrassed by this. -and when I want to fix it, I have no idea where to start.

8,"I've noticed lately, I'm extremely, extremely, e x t r e m e l y slow. I'm slow to grasp things, learn things, and just in general, I lag behind most people. At work, I learn things incredibly slowly, and constantly am nagged by my boss and basically told that I am dumb. I dissociate severely during my flashbacks too, which today I was told by my supervisor that it seems alot like theres no one in ""there"". She also tells me a lot that I'm slower than everyone else. Also, in school I was told at one point and for a while that I learn things fast, but that wasn't really true? I never grasped math or was able to pass advanced courses, I was barely able to make it through algebra. Another thing, I went to Coast Guard boot camp, which I was discharged from due to medical issues, but during it I was never able to learn close order drill, MOA, or required knowledge like my shipmates. I find that I'm absolutely crap at social cues, usually and make myself look so dumb to my coworkers and peers, and in general I'm just so horrendously awkward, and I say things I shouldn't, talk too much and annoy people where they don't want to be around me anymore.

Am I just stupid? Or could this be anything else? I have C-PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety, but is this a side effect of any of those? Or could it be something developmental??",05Nov2017,2
9,"I've seen a few posts on reddit about this, but they've all been archived so I thought I'd bring it back up again. Not sure this is the best place to place this so please tell me if I'm out of line.

Do you think it's possible to be addicted to sleep deprivation? I know that if you're getting less than a certain amount of hours of sleep it's equivalent to being drunk which I guess is what I've been experiencing. For the past two months I've been getting 5-7.5 hours of sleep a night, sometimes more, sometimes less. I've found that for me sleeping 9 hours a day is the ideal amount seeing as how I feel powerless after just 8 hours. But when I get slightly less than the universal recommended amount I feel more alert and ""fuzzy"". It's very similar to feeling tipsy, with your inhibitions lowered. I feel more social, happy and even more promiscuous which is not something I experience too often in my ""normal"" life when I'm sleeping a proper amount. In this well-rested state of mind I'm a rather serious person who constantly has to hide their real thoughts and desires so it's amazing to have no filter once in a while. But I'm finding that this is a way to hide from my real issues, ones that I'm immediately faced with once I've slept enough. I'm sadder and unhappier when I sleep for 9+ hours as well as being prone to an anxious state of mind and depressing thoughts. I don't know how to stop this terrible habit, especially since I'm enjoying it so much. Does anyone else struggle with this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",05Nov2017,3

11,"Hi all, New to this but wanted to hear advice from others that may have more experience. Apologize in advance for the long text!

About 5 years ago, I had my first ""panic attack"". It was triggered when I was driving and all of a sudden I became aware of my own breathing. Following the panic attack, I experienced elevated levels of anxiety for about a week and during that week had maybe a couple more panic attacks. I'm naturally very analytical and because I've never had anxiety or panic issues before, I did everything I could to research what could be the trigger and I attributed it to an ecigarette that I had recently been using (who knows). So I quit that, forgot about the whole ordeal and i basically never had anxiety / panic again for the next five years. It just didn't even cross my mind.

Fast forward.

About 2 months ago, while driving, I had a mini panic attack while arguing with my girlfriend. Again, almost like a flashback, I became aware of my own breathing and there was a feeling of dread / fear. It went away after a few minutes but it left me frightened for a while. For the next couple of weeks, my anxiety levels were heightened and I would keep fearing one thing after another as if my brain was suddenly hyper aware. Some days I would be focused on my breathing, other days I would be focused on my thoughts, etc. etc. I researched everything about anxiety excessively (quite frankly it was probably counter-productive and caused more anxiety) and it's like I've been having to put out a different fire, one by one. For example, the first week I'd have anxiety about driving, then after overcoming my worries, it would be gone. I felt a bit depressed struggling with this so then I'd worry about if I have depression, etc. until I snapped out of it and i'd stop worrying about that and so on. Generally speaking, I believe it's gotten a lot better and I haven't actually had any panic attacks. Also, the actual feeling of FEAR that I got during the first couple weeks has gone away. However, I am still constantly thinking about anxiety, it's like I have anxiety about having anxiety, if that makes any sense. For example, if I feel dizzy or irritable, I'll start thinking oh is this anxiety. At one point I even looked up OCD symptoms because I thought that maybe me thinking about it was actually OCD but it doesn't appear to be since I don't really have any other symptoms. Basically, anxiety has undermined what feeling ""normal"" is.

So I guess I'm just looking for reassurance that everything I'm feeling is NORMAL and not indicative of a mental disorder. I believe the reason why I am still worrying (about worrying, ironically) is because my mother has Bipolar Type I so there's a genetic disposition to mental illnesses.

Other things to note: I'm 29, I have amazing friends / family / support, etc. I'm generally happy (at least I used to think so until anxiety made me doubt that). I have had no issues at work (very engaging / high pressure, need to present to committees, etc.), I go out and socialize with my friends regularly, etc. Whenever I am distracted, I never notice my anxiety. But I just don't know why I am still worried about it, like I'll have a great time with my friends, then I'll come home and I'll think oh I didn't have anxiety, and then just having the thought about not having anxiety makes me think about anxiety all over again. It's been over two months now of me dwelling on this issue.

Is this normal? Will I overtime just forget about it? Is there such a thing as just a brief period of elevated anxiety without it being a disorder? When I read anecdotal stories or symptoms of actual anxiety disorders, it doesn't seem to entirely match what I have. Any experience or insight would be great. Thank you!",05Nov2017,1
12,"I never really saw a problem with it before besides it being financially an awful idea but today I saw my room mate had thrown away her empty bottle of body wash it's somewhat expensive and even though she makes more money than me my first thought was ""I should replace this"" I don't know why I immediately thought that. It's just feels weird because we have been through a lot together and she lives with me and my family (mom and sister) and I considered her family but then she started dating a friend of mine and they both changed completely and we are no longer friends or on speaking terms however I still feel the need to replace this body wash and get her other things that will make her life easier even though I kind of hate her.

Type ""straight guy"" in the search box in his video tab for the videos where he is with straight guys.

I feel no sexual arousal. My face just gets really red and strained. It's not a flirt. It's just anxiety from being friendly or understanding. The straight guys get the same facial expression too, and the gay guy had a neutral facial expression when I get the tight face expression. I'm glad I'm not the only one. This made me feel more confident that I am straight. I guess I just have low self esteem and I'm insecure.

15,"I turned in my resignation as a City Carrier Assistant last week. I  never felt so nervous and happy in my life. The moment I turned the letter in I went straight into a panic attack walking away quickly to my work vechile to be by myself. Management gave me to talk down of why you are resigning, but I keep words to a minimum. 

It was not until I got out of work that I called the Employee Crisis Hotline for help. Talked to a counselor about my problems, and shed a mix of emotions from pain, joy, depression, and stress from work. I needed to be sure I made the right decision.

Today I called off work again and helped my friend do work in his yard. I dreaded them calling me that I had to come to work that day. (If you didn't know my Post Office schedules CCAs everyday.) I was laying in bed in fear for 2 hours just waiting for a call. No call and I went on my day.

In the evening I went to eat with his family, but I lost my appetite. Did not want to eat. Did not want to move. Just wanted to sit there and do nothing.

16,"So in May (at least I think it was May), I drunkenly made a Tinder account (something my sober self would be too afraid to do... not that there's anything wrong it) and unexpectedly met this guy. I don't really want to waste my time with details but I did want to mention that I met him on Tinder because there really is no way to vouch for him (meaning I don't know any of his friends or family or where he lives or anything). Basically, we've been ""friends with benefits"" this whole time because he refused to be boyfriend/girlfriend even though we don't see anyone else but whatever. So this guy... we'll call him Karl...
And oh my gosh so many things have happened with this guy. I'll start from the top when we first met or talked and he told me he does something really illegal for living which is why he always has a gun in his car  and he refused to tell me what that thing was but he hinted that he made a lot of money doing it and once we drove by this big house and he was like ""honestly I probably already have the money to buy that  place"". But now I'm pretty sure all of that was a lie because he doesn't ever bring up that illegal thing he does anymore and he literally asks for $5 for gas like pretty much every time I see him sooo??? Basically he's not the best guy but he caught me at a really bad time in my life right after I had moved to a new city with my family and was lonely asf and knew absolutely nobody... And at the beginning I remember thinking ""he's a little bit manipulative and emotionally abusive""  but I was literally so sad and lonely thatI hardly even cared.
Fast forward to the Fourth of July when he told me he had cancer and that he was leaving to get treatment elsewhere and that he was gonna die and that we were over. He basically said that he was gonna go live with his family in Chicago (not actually that city but whatever) so he could get treatment there. And then that obviously was not the end of us and I was so sad and he did distance himself for a bit but then we started hanging again and like literally every time we saw each other he'd be like ""what if this is the las time you ever see me babe"" and he'd constantly say that he was going to Chicago and wouldn't be back for a while and then he'd end up staying ""just to be with me"" but to be honest I have no actual prroof of him ever going to Chicago besides him just saying it and I don't want to assume that he was lying about being sick because I hope that's something nobody would be stupid enough to do but honeslty he's provided me with no proof that he's actually  sick either. He'd take me off his snapchat for this time (I think he first unadded me the first time he told me that he was going to Chicago) and then he'd constantly lie. Like for example one day I was texting him being totally supportive and asking him if everything was okay because I thought he was in a hospital in Chicago and then I told him I wished he were home because I had some free time and then he was like whatever AND THEN I told him I also had an interview that day at like 2 and then he was like would you miss the interview for me and I just said yes because I figured he was out of town so it wouldn't even matter and then he told me that he was lying and that he was actually in town and then he got mad at me for not missing my interview for him and he'd just constantly do stupid stuff like this and once he told me that he liked making me cry because it showed him how much I care about thim. WHATEVER.
So fast forward to like a couple months ago I tried to break up with him because honestly he'd make me so stressed. It got to the point where even if he just texted me I'd be like ""oh no I don't want to deal with this today"" before even reading his ext message. So anyways, long story short he threatened to kill himself so I stayed with him and ever since then it seems like everyday I despise him more and more and it even got the point where I didn't even like him touching me anymore. Like if he'd try to grab and kiss me I instinctively turn away. So basically I tried breaking up with him again tonight and he wouldn't stop talking and he didn't say anything about trying to kill himself when we met in person but he did say that he had always thought that he would be the one breaking up with me and not the other way around and when I asked why he looked at me and YOU KNOW THAT THIS MOTHERFUCKER SAID?!?!?! He said ""well we both know why deep down..."" and I just looked at hime because I really didn't know why and then he was like ""because I'm  obviously the hot one"". So whatever, I just jumped out of his car in the middle of talking and now I'm home and when I got him he started texting me asking me please to not watch the news for a couple of days and stuff like that (inferring that he was/is gonn kill himself) and I never replied to his last text messages and it's probably been like an hour and honeslty I was really owrried at first but now I feel like he isn't gonna kill himself because he's proably just trying to manipulate  me again but then there's the part of me that was taught never to ignore people if they talk like that but I really just want to block hima and get this over with but I'm stll worried. He's NEVER intorduced me to him family or friends or has even gone out with me in public (although we have gone to his uncles house a lot) we mostly just meet in his car ao I really can't tell anyone and he told me his last name once which was like a really basic Mexican last name but he told me he wa full Indian (and from looking at him and pictures of his relatives at his uncles house) he is. But I googled him like  a million times trying to use literally everything I know about him but I found absolutely nothing. I looked up him number his ""name"" his hometown, the town we live in now, the high school he went to where he was supposedly on the track team and I've found nothing and I only did that because I thought that maybe if I searched hard enough I could find some friends/family of his to tell but I've literally found nothing and now I'm thinking that maybe he's lied about his name even (???) is that crazy?? Anyways I don't know if I should just block him or not and I need serious help.

18,"

I've had on and off depression for a couple years now along with anxiety. This past year has been very stressful for me financially.

 I've begin having these episodes where I start to feel alone and feel vulnerable. I can feel it coming, too. I'll usually leave the room and be by myself while this happens. All my thoughts become rapid and I feel scared. My mind becomes irrational.

It's so hard to explain in writing. 

I hate when this happens. I hate feeling this way. I feel like there's no way out while I'm going through an ""episode"". I'm usually crying and by myself as well, so it takes me a while to put myself back together again. I can't even begin to explain the kind of thoughts that go through my mind. Self harm is a big one. 

My mind is so cruel to me.. the only few times I think of self harming is when I'm in this vulnerable state. I've never harmed myself before, so the thought of actually giving in and doing it makes me feel even more scared and makes my episode even worse. Most of the time I'll stare at something for minutes - I feel frozen and empty and just hoping to be put out of my misery. 

The thought of just pulling my hair out or banging my head against a wall just sounds so satisfying while I'm in that state. Thinking of doing those things when I feel ""normal"" makes me feel so ashamed and sad. 

I know I need to seek professional help, I just don't have the funds to. I just want to feel better and not have anymore of those episodes. I want to feel normal and be able to enjoy doing the things I once loved doing .

21,"So for a little backstory, a few months back I received ECT for depression, anxiety, and hallucinations (mostly auditory) caused by schizoaffective disorder, after years of severe depression, over thirty hospitalization, and nearly twenty failed suicide attempts. It treated the depression and hallucinations quite well, but not the anxiety, which seems to have gotten worse, but whatever, I can live with it. 

Before the ECT I mainly saw strange shadows in the dark that I described as “Dancing Demons”, heard my name being called, and heard several distinct voices (a woman crying, a man who sounds like my dad when he’s angry, a little boy who is sometimes happy and sometime *very* angry, a demon, and a robot). After the ECT, they went away. 

Recently I started hearing things again, mostly whispers, my name being called, and words I couldn’t quite hear. About two weeks ago, however, I started hearing a full voice again, but this one is new. She’s a  woman with a British accent, and the way she talks is weird. Like she’ll start a sentence and be cut off in the middle of a word, like listening to a radio with a bad connection. First she just sort of talked to herself, like the voices normally do, but then she started talking to me, which is unusual. She sometimes asks me questions which I seem to forget immediately, like how you forget a dream when you wake up. Sometimes (mostly when I’m in a bad mood or having a bad day) she tells me to cut myself or kill myself or burn myself with a lighter, or otherwise hurt myself. The other night she even told me her name, which none of the other voices have ever done. She said her name is Annie. 

So I told my nurse about Annie. She was understandably concerned that Annie was telling me to hurt myself, but I said I know I don’t have to do what she says, and consciously I don’t want to hurt myself (but I mean somewhere deep down I must still have that self loathing and craving for pain or Annie wouldn’t say these things, right?) and she seemed fine with that. Then I mentioned that I liked Annie, and that when she came I realized I missed the other voices, like I’d lost a part of me. I kind of think of Annie as a friend, even if she’s imaginary and I can’t control her. That freaked my nurse out a little. She told me I can’t think of Annie as a friend and that I shouldn’t miss the voices in my head, that they’re not good for me. I don’t know what to think now. 

Another thing I should mention is that for the most part I know the voices and the dancing demons aren’t real, I have since I was about sixteen when I stopped seeing my friendly ghost Maria (a woman who stood in my bedroom door and watched me, named after the character from sonic the hedgehog, who she looked like, she never said her actual name).  But when I told my mom I was hearing voices again, she asked me if I ever wondered if I had the ability to connect with the dead. Me and my mom are very spiritual (but not religious, I’m an atheist) people. I’ve always believed in ghosts, hence why I call Maria my “friendly ghost”, so I kind of wonder about that, too. Part of me always thought that maybe the voices were real people, and I’ve even now started to refer to them as “the ghosts” (in this article I refer to them as the voices to avoid confusion). Is that unhealthy? I don’t want all the voices to come back, the demon, the woman crying, and the boy all scare me. But I like Annie. When she’s not telling me to hurt myself she’s quite nice. I’ve even imagined what the good voices look like, what their personalities are. But even as I type this I realize how nuts I’m sounding. But I don’t want to be lonely and Annie keeps me company at night when the nightmares come and I’m too scared to sleep. 

Fuck, now that I’m reading this I realize that I am completely mental, but fuck, if they make me happy why shouldn’t I let them stay??? My doctors going to want to increase my antipsychotic so maybe I just shouldn’t tell her. I like Annie. Annie can stay. Fuck anyone who says she can’t. ",05Nov2017,1

I regularly forget who I am, that I'm dating my boyfriend, things about my personality, where I live (like that I live in the state I do and not the one I used to, that I'm at the store when I'm shopping), etc. If something reminds me of one of these things and I had spaced out and forgot, I can pick back up from where I'm at quickly, but I have moments of confusion and I feel spacey and out of touch often. I don't trust myself or my perception. So while I do remember things, I don't trust my own memory and in conversation I'll be unsure on whether I said something (and repeat myself a lot), be unsure about commitments I made, etc. I don't think I have straight up hallucinations, but I will often hear noises or see things in the corner of my eye, not trust my own perception, and feel like my brain is tricking me.

23,"I have been dealing with diagnosed depression for the last 9/10 years. I was diagnosed when I was 16 and took it very rough and was suicidal for very long. I never tried anything though. I am doing much better today, however I do have pretty much constant anxiety and occasional bouts of depression where I do feel suicidal. 

My mother is a doctor and it was very traumatic when I was diagnosed, both for her and my father (they are divorced). I was difficult to deal with at that stage. I was very troubled but by no means was I a typical terrible teenager. I didn't do drugs, I did drink every now and then when I was out with my friends, but I think I only got drunk once as a teenager. I consider that as very mild compared to stories that I have heard of other kids and what they did. I didn't even have sex until after school. 

It has now happened handfulls of times that my mother chooses to tell everyone how terrible I was as a teenager when I was genuinely and terribly depressed and ready to give up on life, something that she is fully aware of. She makes light of what I went through. I finally confronted her about it this morning after she AGAIN told another person how terrible I was and how I 'made her to be such a bad mother' this past Friday, right in front of me. I sat her down and said that there is something I would like to discuss with her. I told her that I don't understand how she can say this in front of other people when she knows how awful a time I went through. She doesn't mention to them that I was suicidal, yet plays the victim in how ungrateful a brat I was back then. It hurts me very much. I reiterated this to her.

She then boiled it down to make light of things as a coping mechanism for her because she is alone. I find this utterly ludicrous. She makes jokes about my depression because she is lonely? What kind of an excuse is that? What kind of person doesn't think before speaking shit about another person's depression and pretending that it was just you being intentionally difficult?

She was visiting me this week and tries to help me where she can since I am writing my finals soon. This is why I can't understand why she talks like this. She has left this morning and clearly not in the usual happy sense. She seems to be taking my confrontation not so great. I am just concerned that later on she will play the victim again when I believe that it is my right to ask her not talk to other people about a time in my life where I had been at my lowest and pretend that it was just me being a difficult teenager.

Please tell me I an not being unreasonable.

24,"OK so 1 year ago today me and the girl of my dreams had just finished uni after living together for 2 years. then we worked some shitty jobs to save up for a trip around new Zealand. Here is where I make the first mistake: Instead of going together I go ahead to set us up, source a car and make some extra cash, as she wanted to stay for Xmas as her parents had just split up and she wanted to keep the peace.
Fast forward a month and while I'm working hard in nz. She gets a job as a ""dancing girl"" at a club (this is 3xtra surprising and hurtful as she was a virgin when we meet. she's never been with anyone else. she didn't even like being sexy). Obviously I'm jealous and ask her if she's booked her ticket yet. She really enjoys it and doesn't want to come, but doesn't want me to come back either. I'm devastated and start smoking meth and just generally giving up on life (still held down a job though).
time passes and she still won't come. I'm still told if I come over she'll break up with me....
June comes and she breaks up with me via email, but then a week later says if I come back to Europe there is a chance. 
I drive a (possibly stolen...I never asked) car full of drugs across nz to pay for the plane ticket back. I am in a big city with nothing...somehow find a room with a house full of Romanian workers. start working at a car wash. get a job at a bar which I love (the first job I've ever enjoyed). She sees me sometimes, but always keeping herself closed off. But it kinda works for a few months. Until she goes to a wedding in south Africa. I begged her to let me come as well, but she said it might be awkward and wouldn't let me. A week in I'm about to start my shift at the bar and I get a text saying she doesn't think we should be together anymore. (no she didn't cheat on me...trust me on this one. I know it would seem like she did reading this story, but she didn't ). I'm devastated. Go from clean and sober to 2 grams of coke a day (from a number she gave me). 
yesterday I left town to go see my dog before he gets put down on Monday. after having lost my bar for drug related reasons. (like not even something I got caught doing, just a conversation  about drugs someone overheard). I fell to my knees crying as she drove away after saying goodbye. I know she still loves me she just can't deal with my ups and downs. Not that I ever tried to make my problems hers. if I was sad I made sure not to bother her with it.
Anyway now I'm almost 25. my dog dies tomorrow. I wash cars for a living (I have degrees and such so it's not my dream job, but there aren't many things you can do as a druggie...I always hid it from her though.) live in a crummy room with people who don't speak english. I have no friends (the bar was my way to socialise with people...I've never had friends. there are 2 people in the world is could message like a friend). I just don't know what to do. The loneliness is killing me. Come Christmas and soon after my birthday....I don't predict nice things happening.
Basically please someone help...be a friend...something. This is me reaching out. hoping someone out there can make me not want to off myself. 
anyway thanks for reading and really any advice, words of support....anything literally anything would help.
I'm in the UK and yes off the drugs now. 
How do I go on when literaly all I want is her and failing that I want to fill the void with drugs and meaningless sex. 
Please somebody...anybody. help me 
This girl I met 5 years ago turned me from semi professional athlete to drug addic to this now....whatever this is. I honestly don't know what to do next. I am getting a tattoo so that's something to look forward too....wanna be a badass corpse you see :D.
OK now that was really enough of a ramble

25,"There are 3 people who've been through therapy around me. Pre-therapy, these people were extremely warm, empathetic, relatable, and caring.

Now it seems all they do is want to rationalize and deconstruct things and only talk or respond to my messages once in a blue moon.

Just the mere act of talking to them ensues in this giant bullshit for 30 minutes back and forth about how ""Please state clearly what you wanted or expected to talk about before"" and how ""I did not have the emotional reserves to talk with you previously"" and how any single problem ""we need to address the root cause of this"".

What is even going on???? I messaged a friend I'd found very comforting and easy to talk to previously. Today, it felt like I was talking to an aggressive psychotherapist. I messaged her about a crush gone wrong and instead of any empathy or words of comfort she went full psychoanalytic on me. ""What is the root cause of this?"" ""Why does rejection make you feel this way?"" ""What was this connection even?"" ""It's not rejection that hurts but a social structure of what rejection is and us receiving it in the past.""

Like....what?????? Lady I just wanted to be able to talk to you and maybe get a pat on the back. A buck up there champ sound bite. A shit happens and we learn and move on kind of pep talk.

Another friend who went into therapy came out of it very self-absorbed and complete lack of awareness about the other person and empathy.

And now apparently I'm doing it too. All of my friends have said ""Jesus barb, you've gone from 100 to 0. Literally give no fucks. Zero chill. You straight up throw our problems back in our face. You don't even think about what you're saying and how this will make us feel.""

Guys what is going on??? Does therapy actually help? I'm beginning to have severe misgivings. This strange bizarre roboticness is freaking me out about them and myself. Even myself, I've noticed myself becoming more and more self-centred and unsympathetic and unempathetic and unable to focus on the other person or put myself in their shoes.

People used to find me so easy to talk to, now everyone, even my bestest friends from 7 and 4 years back are complaining I've become downright cold and mean to them.",05Nov2017,8
26,"My best plan right now is to take a quarter every second day. But I've read online that just taking the drug re-instates withdrawal symptoms, so I'm afraid I'll be running in circles with the strategy and just torturing myself.

I have no idea what I could do to fall asleep. I'm already taking Quetiapine, which used to knock me out (along with Lorazepam), but now it's not enough. I've been thinking about getting some other drugs, but I'm afraid my GP and psychiatrist are already thinking I'm some sort of druggie. I don't want to ask them, and I don't even trust them anymore, either.

The reason I don't trust them is because I wouldn't have been put on 2.5mg of Lorazepam for the fact that I couldn't fall asleep in less than 2 hours. I'd much rather have taken the 2 hours. They should have told me that those drugs weren't supposed to be taken long-term, but they don't care. And there's no-one else I can go to.",05Nov2017,1
27,"So I have depression and anxiety. For the past 3 or so weeks i've been having dreams where I slit my wrists to die and I wanted to be sectioned but my CBT person decided I was safe to go about life. Also the past 2 weeks i've just felt numb and empty and like i'm not really there.

So on thursday I felt the exact same and then during lunch I went and got a craft knife from art then I went to the toilet and I was about to slit my wrists. I decided I had to do like a test cut further up just to make sure it would work and I wouldn't make a fool of myself. I started to press the knife to my skin and I suddenly wanted to go talk to a teacher.

I've talked to my student manager, the safeguarding officer who is also a teacher I know well and my head of house before about my mental state. So I went to find them but I couldn't find any of them. I stumbled into my friends though and that's when I started bawling.

In the end I talked to about 3 different teachers and to begin with they were just going to send me back to class. Before when I've merely told teachers that I think about killing myself they sent me home and told my parents to get an emergency GP appointment but now that I almost did it it's like nothing happened.
I guess I'm in shock still. Also last time I went to the doctor because I told a teacher I thought about killing myself they just said wait two weeks to see how I am then because my antidepressants might have started working (I'd been taking them about 2 and a half months).

30,"**DISCLAIMER: ///TRIGGER WARNING./// AND SORRY FOR POSTING AGAIN HERE. I KNOW I AM A STUPID SPAMMER. :D**

Hello everyone, 
I want to talk about my mental health journey which started 3 months ago, I am twenty years old man, with no previous history of mental health issues. Unfortunately, my life changed completely in a couple of minutes. Now, 3 months later, I don't know what is happening to me, don't know where I am going and what should I do. I do so much research online, and still I barely can relate to any case of mental health issues.

22 of july this year was the day in which my life changed drastically. I woke up. Everything was fine. I was happy with life and had very clear plans what I want to do in life, how to do it, and was already doing it. I got out of my bed, went outside, bought my favorite coffee and logged in my Facebook account to see what is happening. Suddenly the news about Chester's suicide came in. 
I suddenly asked myself: ""Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?"" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing. My vision became blurry, my heart started beating like I just jumped off a plane... At this point. Something in my brain changed. And i noticed it. It felt like a part of my mind went faulty. 
I started doing research, why he did it? what was wrong with him?

Then I discovered that he had Major Depressive Disorder, Sexual abuse, and multiple addictions. 
But that did not make the things better for me.

The thoughts about suicide were rapid, unstopable. I started researching why these thoughts are happening to me, I was happy with life....but that did not last long.

And here begins my Mental Health Journey:

**August**: The thoughts are still there, everything feels pointless, my apetite is less. There is a feeling which makes everything pointless out of nowhere. I can't concentrate on the things that are important for me. My heart beats faster. My hands are sweating more that the usual. The song ""Ïn the end"" Is still in my head. I tried to do exersise. It did not help. I have no idea what is happening to my head. But atleast It lasts only for the half of the day. For the rest of the day I feel almost normal.

**September**: The thoughts are still there, still rapid, and feel more real, the pointlessness is still there. nothing changed. But became stronger.

**October**: The thoughts are many(I will list them above.) and still there. It feels like the barrier between suicide and me fell which is so scary.  My feelings are really messed up, I can't tell if I am suicidal or just stressed of his suicide anymore. My perception of time and future is really messed up. I can't imagine my future without these thoughts. There are two or three images stuck in my head and 10 years from now feel really close. Life feels long, but at the same time short.  I feel like YEARS HAVE PASSED BETWEEN MY OLD LIFE AND NOW. I feel lost. I know my goals in life, but no longer see a point in them. I skip university because of this things. Whenever I try to imagine my future and be happy, there is a strange feeling inside that tells me it is pointless, without any apparent reason. My perception of time is messed up. I really can't tell who I am anymore. I feel stuck in my head, and I have no idea how to get better. The images in my mind seem dark or the oposite, too bright. My apetite is back to normal. I still can't concentrate on things that matter to me. My heart still beats faster than usual. My hands are sweating more that the usual.
The thoughts are many, and **too real**.  
I will list them here: 

* Why I don't just give up and do it. 
* What if life gets hard and I do it. * Feeling that life is already hard and I will do it. 
* Feeling that I am becoming/became overwhelmed/bored with life and will do it. 
* I don't want kids on this terrible world.(I read this somewhere, and for some reason I think that this means I am suicidal) 
* What if I no longer see a meaning and kill myself(accompanied with a dark feeling which I can't describe that makes me think that I am suicidal.) 
* What Is the point of working for when I can kill myself.(This scares me the most.) 
* Intrusive images of me doing it. 
* Life is not worth living.(I never thought of that before I red it somewhere.) 
* Whenever I do something which proves I am not suicidal there are thoughts and feelings that makes it feel like I don't wanted to do this. Or that doesn't prove that I am not suicidal. 
* It was better to not being born.(Also red it somewhere.) 
* Why not die now, when I will die anyway?(Also red it somewhere and became obsession, and feels real. :( )

**Now**: Nothing brings me joy I am constantly over thinking. I feel like i lost myself, I feel that my life has changed tremendously, I feel like something died in me, I feel lost in life, Like I got through a door from my old life to now and now the door is closed and there is no turning back. Everything feels pointless and temporary, I feel like an alien to my self. It feels like something is draining me inside. I feel weird, like I realised that I am human being for the first time. Life feels short but at the same time long. My mind flipped over.
I went to three psychiatrists. Yet, no clear diagnosis. 
I don't know what is this. I can't relate to anyone. I don't display clear symptoms of depression. 
How my life can change this fast. I don't get it. Any suggestions what is might be?

**And there is a feeling that I don't want to get better, which is scary. :(**

P.S. One of the doctors suggested Pure-O.

31,"(X-posted from the relationships sub) 
I've been with my husband for 5 years and we just aren't getting along well enough to make it for the long haul and are divorcing. We went to marriage counseling for about a year prior to this, and ended it about 6 months ago.

I went to a new PCP the other day and had had my medical records transferred to the new practice (the marriage counselor was in the same medical practice as my old PCP). I went in for a new patient physical and the doctor asked me about my ""anxiety issues."" I ask her what she's talking about and she explains that there's a diagnosis of anxiety in my medical records. I explain I've been going to marriage counseling with my husband, and that's it. I don't have anxiety nor have I been to a therapist otherwise. I also am not an anxious person at all; the issues with my husband are about general incompatibility and disinterest, there's no chance I got this diagnosis due to my behavior.

I head home and tell my husband, and he goes, don't you remember that when we started marriage therapy, the therapist said she'd have to bill this under your insurance under a single diagnosis? I have no recollection of that, and I'm sure had I heard her say that, I would have been concerned. I suspect she said this at the end of some session because each time we went, I spent time scheduling the next session and taking care of the copy while she and my husband continued talking. This is also not the kind of thing my husband takes seriously, he doesn't think about the ramifications of things like this so if I hadn't been listening he might have not thought to bring it up.

So I'm stuck. What I want to do is clear the record and get this false diagnosis off my record, but I'm worried if I call the health insurance company that I might get charged for the full cost of the marriage counseling sessions with my husband. We went 2-4x a month for a year, and sessions out of pocket are hundreds of dollars each. Do I call the therapist and ask her to put down a different diagnosis? Is there someone else I can call about this? I have serious concerns about being labeled with a mental disorder I don't have because if at some point I'm self insured, isn't that going to drive my rates up? I'm not sure what other ramifications there could be but it seems wrong to have this listed on my medical record.",05Nov2017,2

35,"Hello /r/mentalhealth,

I'm a twenty-year-old female and I suffer from depression, anxiety, and OCD. I was diagnosed three years ago and have been in treatment ever since. I take my medication everyday and go to therapy once a week. My mental state, while not always amazing, is stable. What I'm more concerned about is my mental health affecting my physical health.

My main issues are IBS, loss of appetite, and chronic fatigue... in that order. My anxiety manifests in my stomach, so when I get nervous (which is daily), I end up in the bathroom for long periods of time. It only worsens when I eat, so I end up not wanting to eat. The lack of calorie intake causes me to be fatigued throughout the day despite getting nine hours of sleep every night.

I've been to a GI doctor and had a colonoscopy done. Everything was normal and the doctor told me, ""Sorry, you just have IBS."" No medication was recommended and I honestly don't want to be on more medication anyway.

I guess the question I have for y'all is what are my options? Do I focus all my power on alleviating the anxiety and hope that resolves these issues? Do I focus on my physical health and force myself to eat more and begin exercising to relieve the fatigue?

If I focus on my physical health, do you have any resources for finding a good diet and exercise plan?

I appreciate any insight anyone has to offer.

36,"tw: sexual assault and self harm 
also a little nsfw 

Back when I was in high school I was sexually assaulted by this guy I went to the movies with, he kept trying to put his hands in my pants and touch me no matter how much I told him to stop or no. 
Now to this morning/last night. I have been seeing this guy for awhile and we have been “officially” dating for a couple days but Ive been sleeping at his apartment for about two months.  Yesterday was really great! We went to a football game together with his family, and it was a lot of fun. My team won so I was very happy. We got back to his apartment and just sat on his couch and watched shows and ate some pizza and then we decided to go to bed. We had sex which is pretty regular for us then we laid in bed and watched some Youtube videos. I eventually fell asleep while he was doing that. I then woke up to him playing with my breasts and I told him to stop, this isnt too unusual because its just like a silly teasing thing and he stops after a bit and is never rough but he has never done it while Ive been asleep. I would push his hands away but he kept doing it or would be a lot rougher to where it would hurt so I got his hands off me and laid on my chest and then he kept pulling on my underwear and I kept telling him to stop. I felt like I was going to cry so I put my pillow between us and then he started pinching my thigh and I kept saying stop. He somehow managed to pull me so my back was against his chest and he could play with my breasts again. I think this time he felt me really struggling so he grabbed my arms and said “hey its okay, calm down ill stop I promise Ill stop” and he pinky swore with me and stopped. But I just laid there for two hours and cried. I remember just laying there wanting to slit my wrists so I didnt have to feel like that but I couldnt. I dont know how to talk to him about this or if I even should. I know he had no ill intentions because he wasnt even hard at that point. I just dont know what to do. ",05Nov2017,7

46,"My social skills are terrible, particularly when it comes to interacting with strangers in non-academic or non-work related situations. I have a very small social circle, and once I do manage to make friends with people I tend to keep that small group close.  In that sense, I might be a bit of an introvert. I like to foster close intimate relationships, but don't flit around and meet new people.  I mostly meet people through the friends I already have.

The problem is, this keeps me isolated, and limits the number of women I meet.  I go to bar shows to enjoy the music, though I rarely interact with anyone at these shows.  I'm not sure if any of you are familiar with the book Listening to Prozac, but for various issues, various aspects of my behavior, throughout my life (I won't get into details) I feel like I could use an SSRI. 

I'm actually, hoping it might change my life completely, and that I'll become ""better than well"" (as kramer said).  Although I enjoy negative affect, too much is bad.  Although I do deeply enjoy the few intimate (friendships) relationships that I have and I value that sort of thing, I think I'm a little out of balance, and I could use this drug to make me a little more social, and a little more light hearted.  Maybe this might bring people into my life, and improve it overall.

There's a girl I like, which shows some affection for me as well. But I am sure, she doesn't feel enough for me romantically. I told her about my depression to clear out and open up, which she took nicely, having been in a similar situation as well.

OK, so, in her flat share a room frees up and she invited me to live there. I live alone now, which I wouldn't mind changing due to my anxiety. There I would have a friend and live with her and another person. So basically, if I can get over/calm my feelings for her, I'd have a friend and wouldn't be alone.

I posted it in different group too I just want to know if I'm alright.. my family says I'm thinking too much about these things that's why it happens with me but I don't know what to believe and what to do tbh",05Nov2017,4
52,"For as long as I could remember, I longed for when I would be 18.

I would finally be free and be able to do what I want 

I graduated high school in June 2016 and went off to university 

I could finally feel things turning around it was good at the start- and then everything went to shit 

At the time I had no idea my mom was severely narcissistic, the guys I dated were severely narcissistic and that basically I have been living as an extension of other people my whole life hence the chronic depression, boredom, sadness and people pleasing 

I had a mental breakdown and wasted a ton of money, racked up credit card debt, did drugs, got good grades in university at first but it all went down hill when I ""snapped"" 

Now I'm back in a city I throughly detest, living with my narcissistic mom who bullies me since I have no money and nowhere else to go 

I'm trying to get back into school for January in a different city and I know it will be better then where I am, but even then something is driving me to just start all over in a new country, specially somewhere in Europe 

But I have no idea how, why I want to, or where to get the funds to do this 

At first u thought I had bipolar or schizophrenia because I got so stressed out I would occasionally hallucinate and hear things/ see things but the psychiatrists say I'm just overly stressed and anxious 

I know ive always wanted to travel and it seems so impossible with no money 

I still have no idea what I want to do in life and I believe travelling would help me find that 

I'm so lost

53,"Hello. I have a mental health problem which irritates me more and more with each passing day.

It's hard to explain it but I get overexcited very easy and start sweating and tensing my body muscles. This is uncontrollable and it happens with things that I'm passionate about. If someone is talking about history, if I'm watching some show which I think is epic, or I watch some dancing performance (thr things I'm passionate about) I get shivers , cold sweat , headache from the body tension and I just want it to stop. With each passing day it gets more and more severe. I just want to do the things I like without getting overexcited and covered in sweat.

Is it possible to ""cure"" this or I will suffer forever? Thanks!",05Nov2017,1
54,"Hello, im a 21 yo boy, recently graduated from college. Here's my story:
2 years ago i met this girl at campus. The chit-chat was smooth and we became friends. I started talking with her every day and we became close friens . She was funny, attractive and happy. The more and more i got closer to her, she opened up to me , telling me she had depression and she was always anxious and nervous. I told her: I will always support you ,you are my best friend. As time passed , we became really close and i started to develope feelings for her, so one day i asked her out the question: Do you wanna be my girlfriend? She replied: no. I was heartbroken but not really sad, i wanted to keep the friendship. However , we started to develope more-than-friendly behaviour. We holded hands , we kissed, we were really close. I was really confused because it was my first romantic relationship(?) so i just played along. I knew she had 2 ex-boyfriends but i didn´t care too much. As time went by, our relation was a mix of love/hate/pressure/need. I didn't had many friends but she could make friends so easily and so fast, it made me feel jelaous but she told me i was her bestie, her best friend, she even called me by sweet nicknames from time to time. It was hard. Honestly , dealing with a friend with depression, anxiety , weekly psychologic sessions, pills , and etc was a lot to digest because i was the one she trusted and the one she was always telling things while keeping a happy , cheerful face on the outside ( she was pretty and around 1.5m so she was like a doll). Time went by and i graduated from college ( Im a glasses nerdy guy with a microelectronics degree) and we started to became a little bit more distant ( she is still in college , will graduate in 2 years ). She even changed her career to electronics so i could support her and always be for her. As time went on , i was starting to feel pain , loneliness and grief. She always asked me for favors and i was always ready for her,she started to message me less frequently , we saw each other less and less but still, i tried to keep up the friendship , i was the one always trying. Sometimes i told her: What if i leave? -And she: NO !! , stay with me !. She was so nice and lovable when she wanted to. Anyways, in the two years that i was her friend, i asked if she wanted to be my girlfriend like 4 times with a no as answer and that made me really sad but still , i had to keep trying , try to get the girl. In the last month, her treatment was really distant , she was away and whenever i tried to contact her , she was like: I was studying , i had this project ,i need to do a group work, and i was like: Dont worry , keep studying hard !!!, I was lovable , cheerful , tried my very best to please her , send her gifts , letters , toys and plushes, cook for her and wait her outside her college classes. Yesterday , she messaged me she met a guy from her class like a month ago , they started to talk and now he asked her to be his girlfriend , and she told him : yes.
Oh god , my chest.
My whole world , the pain.
I just cried and cried endlessly, couldn´t understand what happened. for a moment i thought everything was a joke and this was a dream , but no. I called her crying/shouting telling she that she literally destroyed me , and destroyed every bit of my heart. She cried too , she told me she didn´t knew what was happening with this dude , things were moving to fast and she said yes. I was heartbroken. In multiple ocassions she make me cry and gave me pain but she always ended up in tears asking for forgiveness. This time was different. This time it was hell. I asked her crying : What do you want from me ? , Am i not good enough for you ?, ( My feelings were crushed).
And this is the part when everything made sense and i was petrified.
She told me that she was like this and she couldnt change, that this happened before with her 2 ex boyfriends , she used them like toys , then she got bored and got a new one ( she cheated twice ). She told me : You are different , you are a good guy, that's why i told you no. But i can´t help it, this is what i am and im not sure that i can change right now.
My heart is devastated. I told her that i don´t want to speak with her anymore ( I deleted her from every social media and blocked her number ). I have a opportunity to take a masters program in microelectronics and inmediately i started to do the paperwork and registration while crying and mumbling how i lost my everything, my lover , my best friend , my only friend.
I wrote this in between registrations so if you have any questions or something that helps filling gaps or holes in the story , please ASK. I want to be listened , i want a shoulder to cry on.",05Nov2017,3

56,"I apologize if this isn't the right place, but I was thinking about something I used to experience as a child and up until about puberty, but never asked anyone about it at the time. Here I go:
When I was a kid I used to occasionally seem to experience these brief periods where I could not hear any inflection in anyone's voices. Everyone would sound flat, and I could not hear any emotions in the voices - almost like robots (well, not really). Other sounds (like noises etc), also sounded flat. These would only last for a few minutes and only happened very rarely and sporadically and seemed to stop around the age of thirteen or so.
I don't know how to explain this any better, and it's not a going concern, but I have always wondered what these were and if everyone went through this... 
Does this have a name?
Thanks a lot for taking the time to read this, and have a great day everyone!

Since then I have visited my kids who live with my wife twice, staying each time for a weak at their house. Left yesterday, now I am a mess again. Since many years my wife did not show any affection, love, respect..., was just polite, let me scratch her back, touch her etc without showing any signs of pleasure or liking. Last year I cought her cheating. That hurt me a lot, still I forgave her without her asking me for forgiveness. 
I don't remember to have received anything good from her. Now she gave me the divorce papers.

Yet, I feel like she is the center of my universe. How can I stop it? I need to let her go, I want her to be happy and understand that I cannot make her happy and for her our relationship is finished irreversible. I feel like a creep, I don't want to be. I need to forget her completely, but that makes me not want to contact my kids. But I like my kids and I don't want them to loose their father. But the whole situation tears me apart. 
I understand that in my brain there is something wrong. I have no reason to like that woman, why do I cry for loosing her. 
I am working full time, but at work I can hardly think. Where I live now I don't have any friends, colleagues at work are ok though. I don't have any hobbies nor do I want any.

69,"Hey guys. I'm a 21 year old college student just looking for some advice if you can offer it. I'll give you a simple rundown of my situation.

I often feel pretty tired for no apparent reason. It's not even that my life is too busy or anything. I just find that I'm really exhausted all the time. Accompanying this feeling is what seems like an ever present mental fog. Sometimes it's so bad I can't even comprehend what I'm reading in a textbook even after going over a section numerous times. This sense of fatigue makes it hard to concentrate on my work. It just feels like my brain is really slow and I have difficulty processing things. It also feels like I have low mental agility overall. There are sometimes when this isn't a problem but they're uncommon. It's as if my mind isn't operating at it's full capacity.

It also feels like my mood often times is grey, as if I'm maybe mildly depressed. Life just seems uninteresting and bland. Sometimes it feels like things I used to like to do are less enjoyable than they once were (anhedonia). I don't have suicidal thoughts or anything that extreme but these things are worth noting.

I don't get any exercise which I know is an issue and can impact mental health and energy levels. Nor do I eat a particularly good diet. However I get a good amount of sleep, but it might not be quality sleep.

I've thought about talking to someone about my issues but I just can't seem to build up the courage to actually do it. It's like theres a wall preventing me from doing so.

Anyways, if you guys could offer me some tips that you think would help that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.

Edit: I should add more. I've been feeling this way for years I think. Sometimes when I read I just get tired. I have no idea if I have ADD or I'm just to fatigued to concentrate on something so it makes me seem like I have it. Will update more If I can think of anything.",05Nov2017,9
70,"Hi All,
First time poster here.

&amp;nbsp;

I am reaching out for others who have a similar experience to me as far as their perception and consciousness of their existence goes.

&amp;nbsp;
 
I am not sure how to label this, or what medical field would deal with it or address it - which is my main goal - to at least find some common language to describe this state of being.

&amp;nbsp;

For a long time I have felt like I am different to many around me. Smaller in scope in some way.
Now this could be looked at as a self-esteem or self-confidence issue - but I am generally quite self aware in this way, and it is not.

&amp;nbsp;

My experience of day to day life seems to be limited in scope, where as others seem to be able to see life in a 'wider view', having hopes, dreams, emotions, and plans for the future beyond their immediate existence.

&amp;nbsp;

On the surface I can seem like and fit in with everyone else, but when all is said and done, others tend to move forward in their life; where as I stay reasonably static; and more to the point, I don't seem to have the want, need, or thought to change.

&amp;nbsp;

The best way I can describe this is comparing an animal to a human being.
The difference I would describe between most animals and humans, is that an animal will do the same things, day after day, ever day.
This is not because they don't want to change; it's because they don't have the mental facility to imagine anything different to how things currently are, and so therefore have no need, want or motivation to change things to get to a different state.

&amp;nbsp;

Humans on the other hand, one of our defining features is our ability to imagine the unreal. We can then use our mental tools to move ourselves from where we are to where we want to be.

&amp;nbsp;

Another way I like to think about it is, if you imagine most people are both the music player and the composer in their life.

&amp;nbsp;

There are two layers at work:

&amp;nbsp;

**The music player:**

Can only give it's attention to the current page, or last couple of pages of sheet music.
Will read this sheet music and play it.

&amp;nbsp;

**The composer:**

This is a 'second layer' of consciousness. The composer will actively look at what music they have composed before, and how it has been played, and lay new sheet-music pages down in front of the player, altering it on the fly to make adjustments.

&amp;nbsp;

Without the composer, the player will keep playing the sheet music until they reach the end, at which point they will just repeat the last couple of pages they have in their memory; and in fact will not feel the need to ever do anything different, not being truly aware of the absence of the composer and not knowing what it is missing out on by playing the same music again and again rather than experiencing new music given by the composer (you don't know what you don't know)

&amp;nbsp;

This is how I would describe myself.
Whilst intellectually I know that there should be a composer, for large swaths of my life, I have been happy to be on repeat, in a comfortable place, never questioning the loop.
Think swaths of seven years at a time.

&amp;nbsp;

One can still be very successful and conscious in goal oriented situations, such as a professional career - as in this situation the employer is taking over the job of the composer and providing the goals and sheet music. In fact one can be better than other people in some sense, as there is no distraction or conflict from the 'real' / personal composer - all effort is focused on the provided goals by the employers 'composer'

&amp;nbsp;

A few times, I have had 'wake up' moments where I have gained this visibility out of this consciousness 'hole', and been terrified that I had wasted so much time stuck in it, static and inert.
This usually tapers off like coming down off a drug. I hold onto the knowledge that I know there should be more; but without the composer, it's just facts, not visibility, and I inevitably end up back in the loop.

&amp;nbsp;

The reason I even believe things can be different is because of these few times where everything 'clicked' into place and I felt like I could 'see'. The paradigm shift is so profound that it cant be ignored, but sadly try as I might, I have never been able to reproduce this state on purpose - yet it feels so much like a 'switch' has been flicked and the lights are on that there must be some basic root cause to it. Some deficit. Something.

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone else identify with this?
Is this neurological? Is it some kind of neurotransmitter mediated thing - Glutamate, GABA, Dopamine, Norepinerphrine, or Dopamine imbalances?

&amp;nbsp;

Or is it phenomenological, due to personality, personal history or traumas etc?

&amp;nbsp;

Don't know where to start to investigate.

&amp;nbsp;

I should also say, being stuck in a loop has had it's benefits - being that without the 'composer', the music player does not need to expend mental energy on learning to play novel 'music', and so is free to devote ALL energy to the parts of the music that are in the loop - becoming ultra versed in it.

71,"I don't have the mental wherewithal to do the psuedo-poetic bullshit I usually do. Run with an extended metaphor comparing life or depression to the ocean or some stupid-ass flower. You asked me to write about fragments. I think of glass when I think of fragments. Fragments can be dangerous to clean up after. It's easy to cut oneself in the process. Glass. Mirrors. Fragments. Am I doing this right?

I'm tired of making the wrong decisions. I attempt to flaunt how smart I think I am even when I barely slur the words ""inferiority complex"" through my drunken stupor. Perhaps I would think more clearly if I smashed the bottle over my fucking head.

Fragments.

It's only been 11 minutes since I started writing. I've been counting minutes a lot lately. Spend my days counting the hours that pass. Spend my nights doing the same thing. I set small goal points. Make it another 15 minutes. Just hang in there. I break my time up into smaller, more digestible chunks.

Fragments? That one is a stretch. Then again, what do I ever say that isn't? There's no sincerity in anything I say or do. I only know how to be false to myself. Pathologically so. I say what sounds the best. I rehearse all the lines I know you'll like, a caricature of the best, most ideal version of myself. Every other word is brutally honest and painstakingly manufactured.

Fragments. Fragments. Fragments.

I'm tired.

My brain constantly attacks me. It makes writing hard sometimes. My hand can't keep up with the pace of my thoughts and my thoughts can't keep up with the pace at which my brain violently churns them out. I overanalyze everything and break them down until I've stripped away everything they are, leaving only the sum of their parts.

Fragments.

I don't know what I'm looking at. My vision is skewed. I attempt a change of scenery but I still end up looking through the same lens. My environment was never the problem. My brain is at high alert at all times. Synapses fire at full capacity, fueled by panic. Insecurity. Longing. Pain. Sometimes I wonder if the cost of keeping this faulty piece of machinery up and running is worth the diminished returns. You tell me to breathe. I don't tell you maybe that's the fucking problem. Sometimes I fantasize. About leaving behind fragments.
