0,"I really feel a lot of emotional pain everyday, I am 100% manic in the way my emotions regulate. 
I am very very intelligent but am unable to function properly due to this ""problem"". I have anxiety because I cannot trust if I'll be the same positive person tomorrow. It's really weird, people absolutely love me because of my huge amount of empathy, and my openness, and only those closest too me get to see the opposite. I have two sides with a middle ground of emotionless anguish where I sit most days. Around friends or with drugs I can cope with the emotionless normality and ""feel"" again, but when alone or if something really sets me off, I turn from Dr. Jekyll into Mr. Hyde. I become the most cynical negative person, and although I know I am acting foolish, it's like I am to smart for my own good because I cannot 100% prove to myself that I am worth anything. It's crazy no matter how hard I try to hold back that negative mindset, I always give in because it feels so ""gooooooood"". Actually it doesn't feel good, It just relieves this EXTREME feeling of agitation, but then I in turn hate myself for giving in, and so the cycle continues. Now I've started almost knocking myself out with punches when I have really let go. That was a sign that I need help, I cannot figure this one out on my own.

This is a mirror image almost of how my father acts, and it's something I hated him for. I now feel bad that he has dealt with this for 60 years because when he is in a good mood I wouldn't have any other guy to be around.I have never lived with him and have only spent about a weekend every month since birth with him. I have a constant urge to smoke weed to calm the thoughts of always needing to be ""doing"" something. I don't know guys, I'm just shouting at a wall hoping it will reply. I'm in massive pain haha please please send words that will help this damn brain of mine. 

Ps: this really started getting worse about 4 years ago. I started having the most introspective thoughts and my clarity seemed to slip away... it's really hard to accept that I used to handle my own mind, and it has now become unbearable. I hate that I'm not smart enough to deal with it on my own. I feel like I have answers but they never work.

It is also run by students...


I know beggars can't be choosers, but I have seen a bad therapist before and I want to avoid that experience since it made me worse. 


I am dealing with some serious family issues which in turn makes me depressed. I lost my entire support group over the course of few months. I am self-conscious.

I am in a foreign country, have no friends. It has been days that I haven't had contact or spoken to another person. It is a lot for me. I can't sleep...

9,"Usually in competitive games I tend to tilt extremely easily and I end up getting extremely angry at the game which ends up spiraling out into general dissatisfaction with life.


Just today I kind of shut that anger off to a degree. I still feel it, but it isnt explosive, its just more internal. The result ended up being the same anyways, I just stop playing the game for a very long time.


I go into a match of any competitive game and for the most part I dont bring any positive outcome for the team and I end up being dead weight no matter my actions. The hell with the supposed journey to being proficient, I would rather not spend an outsized amount of time trying to improve at something that I know other people will always surpass me in.


I know that it is a pointless way of viewing competition and you could apply that way of thinking to any other skill or hobby in existance, but my gut feeling makes it seem so logical compared to something like a growth mindset, which to me seems like just standing there and getting hit in the face until you can land a blow back. You are still getting hit in the face. I also realize that I will never recieve any enjoyment out of life living like this, but again, gut feeling states otherwise


Tldr: how do I see losing as something constructive and how do I gain a growth mindset, a mindset that seems completely illogical to me; and finally, how do I stick with something despite my gut feeling telling me to give up at the first sign of trouble.",02Oct2017,2

11,"I've been depressed for a long time, I don't really talk about it but yeah. Everything went to shit for a while. My dad got seriously injured, mom tried to kill her self, almost died from an infection then tried to light her apartment on fire. I also found out she's on meth now (she's been a drug addict for a long time but not meth). 

I went through most of high school with no friends (I'm in grade 12 now) mostly because I'm just too freaked out to talk to people and isolated myself a lot. 

Now my dad is starting a business and he just seems a lot happier. He's also gained back almost full mobility (he still struggles but he can get around), my mom found a place and is some what mentally stable (still on drugs tho), I started talking to a girl I used to know and we've been hanging out a lot and actually get along pretty well, I have a date with a nice dude soon (I've known him for years but we never really hung out unless with a mutual friend I had lost contact with before yesterday) and I've been feeling less shitty besides the anxiety of actually being around people. I still feel like a pile of shit but things are just ok for the first time in a long time. 

I'm just kind of afraid everything is going to go to shit or I'm going to some how mess this up. I don't know. Part of me just wants to push everyone away again and go back to being isolated. I know this is dumb. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to get it out there. ",02Oct2017,8
12,"Hey all. So I've had a long battle with mental health issues. I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder when I was 13.  It steadily got worse as I got older as my difficulties in life got worse (I'm gay in the deep South where the Bible rules as law of the land). I had major issues with my family on and off and tried to commit suicide to the first time when I was 19.  Then it got really bad when I was around 21/22. Major depression episodes, panic attacks, and several suicide attempts up until this year.  Well.. I never went through with it in the sense of me attempting and surviving. But I planned it out and set out to do it and was talked out of it by friends and the Trevor Project.  My family threw me out this year and took most of my belongings including my car because of me being gay and an atheist as well. I've been dealing since then. Honestly I've been significantly better off mentally. No depression episodes or anxiety attacks. Which is great because I couldn't afford to pay for my medication anymore and had to get off of it.  Yeah I know. Don't lecture please. Anyways, fast forward a few months and I lost my job due to having to miss a lot of work from being sick a lot.  I'm overdrawn with my bank and all I have left money wise is quarters. I'm supposed to be starting a new job next week but right now I'm just so close to having nothing left.  I've sold off some of my more valuable possessions to pay for groceries and I'm about to have to sell my bicycle which I was using to get to my last job (my next job is too far for a bike ride and so I'm going to have to ride the bus which is how I'm justifying selling it. In the mean time my mind has been really active the past couple weeks. I can't go to sleep without a sleeping pill every night and I'm feeling suicidal again. Thinking about killing myself and who I'd want to have my things.  My family did some truly evil things to me and caused major fear for me. I'm truly afraid of what would happen to me if they found me (they don't know where I live). I can't get those images out of my head and they follow me into my dreams. This compared to relative calm until recently. I'd improved a lot and wasn't as on edge as I am now.  I will say that I went to counseling for a couple years until this summer but can no longer go to that particular service.  I'm kind of on my own now. ",02Oct2017,2

Everything is great, other than when he goes into this mode of not wanting to socialize or communicate with anyone that he doesn't have to.

I had used adderall for a bit in the past and can definitely see why some people to commit to these types of serotonin/dopamine boosting drugs for so long.

19,"Asking out of curiosity here, I came across a thread on Reddit where OP says his elderly neighbor who is retired and lives and sometimes works at home died of black mould poisoning, but no black mould was found in his home. He also says people in his town just mysteriously kill themselves en masse and he can travel through time.

Here is his post. He adds to the story in his comments.
https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/72pnoz/i_dont_walk_outside_at_night_anymore/

In one of his replies, he says his story is ''no pasta'' and that it's real, but I don't know if he's legitimately messing with people. 

Either way, his story is 95% upvoted, and has been given a lot of attention and he is replying to comments always in character.

His story also mentions red eyed anthropomorphic dogs chasing him, time travel and exploding deer.

If this guy isn't lying, I'd like to know what could be wrong with him. I have a huge interest in people such as this. I've came across people who make up stories such as this, involving creatures (often mythical creatures) that don't exist and they are always overly detailed and fantastical and typically involve being chased at night by said mythical creatures (such as OP's story where he's chased by anthropomorphic red eyed dogs). He compares his town to the town from Stephen King's IT. I think he says he is about 19 years old and this stuff happened when he was 9 to 13.

I tried searching for any news coverage of this, or anything online about it, and I can find nothing. Surely a town that has anthropomorphic dogs, exploding deer, mysterious heart attacks and suicides, people dying from black mould that isn't there and time travel would get some attention in the news or at least investigation?

21,"...I don't know anymore.

I'm stuck.  Alone, no love.  I feel empty and numb when I'm lucky, anxiety and panic attacks when I'm not.  At the drop of a hat anger and rage wash over me, it happens too quickly for me to control it.

Genetics is a bitch, pretty much guaranteed I'd struggle, mental illness is so prevalent on both sides of my family.  But nothing will fuck you up quite like growing up with the mentally ill.  We learn so much about relationships and how to behave from our parents.  It's not nature or nurture, it's equally both together.  Guess I was doomed either way.

I never got to be a kid.  Locked away, isolated in an old farmhouse.  Homeschooling they called it.  A joke is what I say.  I didn't learn much, my ""high school diploma"" was earned through lies.  I say I don't remember much of my childhood.  In truth, it all just blurs together because it was the same shit over and over. My abiding memory of the holidays is not some family get together or receiving the perfect gift; it's my father throwing the Christmas tree to the ground, the ornaments breaking.  The same old shit over and over.  Mom and dad are fighting again.  Time to hide upstairs and try to drown out the shouting with the radio.  Sister ran away again, god knows where.  Here she comes back again, strung out and starting another drama.  Wonder what she'll steal this time?  Brother is pinning me to the floor again, shouting in my face.  Exposing himself, why does he want to rub one out in front of his little brother?  All victims of circumstance and misery, easier to take it out on each other than to end the cycle.  My mother didn't deserve the life she got, no one deserves what she got.  But it's hard not to be resentful when I know for a fact she had great opportunities to escape but didn't.  Choosing this life for yourself is one thing, forcing it on your children is another.  I remember, as a child, coming to her crying, desperate, begging.  I was so lonely, I just wanted a friend.  Some consistent connection outside of the house.  The best I got was bible school for a week.  One week to meet someone and never see them again.  Eventually, I gave up.  I adapted to the isolation.  That was my childhood, those were my teen years.  No socialization, no self-discovery, no exploration.  Locked away in an old farmhouse.

For my wasted childhood, I can point fingers.  For the wasted years as a young adult, I can only look in the mirror.  I chose not to seek help while I could.  I'd grown so accustomed to being alone that I actually became proud of what I was.  Didn't realize until too late how damaged I was, how stupid I was.

So, now I'm stuck.  The worst part of it is, part of me still doesn't want to get out.  I'm afraid of myself.  The warning signs of an abuser are there, all of them.  Rage and mood swings, violence comes so easy.  It's not just speculation, I know it's in me.  I've done it before.  I love animals but it's so easy to lash out.  It's not just the physical part either.  Jealousy, controlling, isolating, blaming, exploiting.  I've done it before.  Thankfully it was long distance, I hope it didn't affect her too deeply.  I don't hate women, I really don't.  My head gets filled with these horrid thoughts and always the anger, so swift and all-encompassing.  Like a red fog descending on my mind, only half-remembering what I did.  I hate what I've done, I hate what I am, I hate how much like my father I am.  There is a monster inside of me.  At least alone I know I'm only a danger to myself.  I'd rather be in misery than hurt someone else.

Being a pill-popping zombie would be better than this.  A lobotomy, going through life on auto-pilot.  At least I'd contribute something more than increasing the world's suffering.  What I wouldn't give to be normal.  I'm so full of love, but it only comes out as obsession.  I don't know how to trust.

Every day I get older, my chances evaporating.  So little experience in life and love.  I can't get the help I need, can't afford it and no insurance to cover it.",02Oct2017,2

24,"Hi all. Need some advise for my brother in law who’s suffering really bad with depression at the moment. 

He has been diagnosed with severe depression and his job is one of the triggers for his depression. He hates it beyond belief, but due to his depression he’s got no motivation to look for another one. 

He went to the doctors 2 weeks ago who signed him off work for 2 weeks and diagnosed him with severe depression. Now his 2 weeks are up and unfortunately has to go back to work. The night before his first shift back he came bounding through the door in tears and looked completely vacant in the eyes. Saying:

 “I don’t want to do it anymore” 

In all his 10 years at his job he has never had a sick day, always been there and been a hard worker.. we’re struggling as to what the best course of action would be.. would it be beneficial to go back to the doctors and stress what’s happening?

Long story short last time I was in inpatient treatment I knew all the clinical staff and even the owner very well. And I trust them. I do. 
And They wouldn’t let me leave til I started taking latuda for bipolar.  Seeing as lexapro alone wasn’t working. I’ve participated in 12 step meetings most my life and I believe they work I just couldn’t get myself together 

Listen I’ve shot coke dope and smoked crack, self harmed on and off my whole life. I remember being suicidal before I even picked up a drug. 

Sometimes I just struggle with this concept of needing these prescriptions and I wonder if I’m just addicted to them at this point. If I run out of lexapro I Get manic. Is that because I AM bipolar or simply withdraw. 

I can’t help but think these medications are just poisoning me.

37,"I want to raise her to be strong, kind, loving, self sufficient, and hard working but it has been an uphill battle all the way. She just turned 13 last month and I fear the next 5 years if I can not find a way to get through to her as we have tried everything we know. From hardcore grounding, to gentle pleading talks which seem to go in one ear and out the other. Here is some background to current info to understand the problem.


When our daughter was born we decided I would stay home to raise her while he worked to support the family (we both were latchkey kids and hated it). It was not an easy decision as we knew our budget would be very tight but to us it is worth it. We used this as an example among other things to teach her there would be tough choices in life and to not make rash decisions and to think a problem through with benefits and concicinses. Over the years we have tried to teach the importance of please and thank-you, giving to those in need (once a year we go through the house and fill boxes with clothes that don't fit and stuff we don't use and take it to goodwill. We let her do her own items.), and only take help if you really need the help, which we live by this ourselves. I will admit that I am a over-protective, and kind of strict mom that will not let her wear high heels, skirts/shorts above the knee, revealing or lacy (aka sexy) clothing. She knows that she can choose to have her ears pierced and wear makeup/nail polish when she turns 16-17. Both me and my husband are very introverted people and only have a couple of friends each (which I now realize was a mistake) so she did not have play dates or sleepovers, which according to the school has put her socially behind. I regret this, but I had been hurt so many times in the past by people that I avoid them. Now I will give you the problem I am having and so desperately want to fix as I fear for her future if I can't.


She has a violent temper (I did as a child also). When she is grounded or asked to do something she does not want to do she will scream and/or hit herself. I have talked to her about it many times, even telling her about my own temper and how I had learned to control it. I also told her what worked for me may not work for her and she would have to find what works for her. We searched the internet for different ways to try, but she does not seem to even be trying.


We have tried to teach her that nothing in life is free and that you must work hard for things you want in life. But she seems to have a sense of entitlement (I think she is getting this from kids at school) as she has stated that she should not have to do anything at home. The only thing we ask of her is that she clean her own room, do her homework, and one chore a day (such as taking out the trash, or loading the dishwasher and putting away the load before). When reminded she drops to the floor and cries, or starts screaming about none of the other kids have to do that. She changes clothes many times a day creating un-needed extra laundry for me to do. She sees how hard we work, but it does not seem to matter to her.


She does not know the value of money. She will use half a bottle of shampoo in the shower or even mix the shampoo with other stuff to “see what happens”. She uses goobs of toothpaste when brushing her teeth. She crumbles deodorant to play with like clay, and much more to long to list here. We have showed her many times the proper amount to use but it seems she just does not care.


A month ago we discovered that she has been going to the bathroom in containers in her room. When we sat down to talk about it she stated that she did not feel like wasting the time to go downstairs to the bathroom. We were horrified and took away computer privileges for 2 weeks, and explained the health concerns and danger this could create. She swears she has stopped but I don't think she has, I think she is finding a way to get rid of it before we find it as her room still has a bad smell to it.


We love our daughter so much, and she is our only child. I want an awesome future for her but all I can see right now is struggle and sadness and it is breaking my heart. I and seeking advice and/or other sub-reddits I might post in that might help. Thank you in advance for any advice or referral to other sites/reddits given.

41,"I'm going to try to condense this as much as possible, as if I got into specifics this would be too long. I've been feeling this way probably since I was 16, I'm 21 now.

Basically in my brain I am convinced that I don't deserve what I have in my life; everything from being in university to living comfortably in the house with water and electricity to being a human worthy of love from my own parents. I'm also convinced that my boyfriend doesn't love me as much as any of his exes even though his actions acrually prove otherwise. I'm convinced I'm going to die alone and never be able to take  care of myself.

And this is where I don't understand what's wrong with me. I think about these things everyday and tell myself very matter-of-factly that I don't deserve anything I have or to be loved and I don't flinch or get upset. I continue to interact with people even though I feel like I'm wasting their time and they're better and more put-together than me. However some days I get really depressed about it and have crying breakdowns. Every time someone tries to comfort me, I can never believe them and I only start crying harder when they tell me I'm smart or creative or whatever. 

My beliefs are ADHERED in my mind and every time someone shows interest in me as a friend or whatever I instantly hold them to a lower regard because only someone really stupid would go that low, to approach me of all people. I know this is such a horrible way to think. But nothing gives me validation because deep in my heart I feel I don't DESERVE validation. 

There is a speck of positivity in me only, that still says I do deserve to be loved and all that. But I'm also convinced that that speck is just there because humans are, from nature, hopelessly optimistic. And it might be true, maybe I do have redeemable qualities and deserve love and success. But I am a very analytical thinker and I cannot find proof for that in my head. 

I do think this might be depression but I don't feel like I even deserve that 'title'. Like I'm just using it as a scapegoat for how I'm feeling. But if I do have depression then why do I not have the strength to kill myself? Why am I still obsessed with keeping the house and myself clean? Why do I still care about going to uni and completing my work? Why am I feeling too scared to lose control, when people with depression just don't care what happens? 

Hence this is why I don't know what's wrong with me, if this is a mental illness outside of depression. Sorry for the rambling. Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I had to put this somewhere to see if anyone else relates to any part of this or sees a pattern of thinking indicative of some mental illness. Though again... I truly am convinced I don't deserve anything but in society they tell you everyone deserves a place in this world even though that's not true...",02Oct2017,1
42,"but it's been like this for ages and taking an angry, fiercely determined approach has led to the same place all the other reactions did, which is giving up, forgetting, falling off the wagon, losing interest, getting distracted.

I don't even know what the point of this post is. I feel like I just can't do it. That's the truth. Life is too brutal and the onslaught is too constant. The world and the things in it which cause me pain are so much more persistent than my ability to fight back or cope or accept or whatever paradigm you want to frame the ""fight"" as.

It's so insanely frustrating. I hurt in so many ways and it's not for lack of effort on my part. I am doing my god damndest but it's not enough. 

I often think of dying but there is enough in me that wants to live, but it's not like that stops the world from kicking my ass.

Bah, I don't know what to do to change. I'm fucked up in so many ways and struggle to even be able to describe those troubles. I really feel stuck in my brain.

This is just another flail, another attempt for short term catharsis from my woes. Sounds so pretentious, ""woes"". 

I want to believe that I can stick to a regimen or path or whatever so that I can meticulously figure out if something will work or not, i.e- the gut/brain connection requires a person to stick to a strict diet for a time to see if that brings about a desired result, but I can't seem to stay focused and dedicated long enough to yield results from methods like that. 

I've stuck with therapy, support groups, practices for a time, sometimes up to a couple years, but I never quite feel like I'm getting the benefit that other people are getting.

My attention and motivation are scarce at best, and on top of that are so fractured between work, daily life struggles (flat tire, fucked up family issues, coworker being a dick and it throws me off for days, speeding ticket, forgot something very important and now someone is mad at me), debt, trying to claw my way out of debt, working two jobs, having body image issues and constantly struggling with perfectionism around diet and fitness, addiction/alcoholism, depression, OCD, hypersensitivity, anger issues, isolation, bah! My mind is just so broken and the problems are so numerous, and on top of it all life just seems to be a pointless joke full of misery so what the fuck is the point???

43,"I'm a 29 years old man and I've never seen a mental health professional in my life, mainly because I think I don't need it.
I started my own kind of therapy by reflecting on myself and my life more than 10 years ago following a really bad drug experience.
Before this bad experience, I was already struggling to find my place in this world, which manifested with violence to other during my teen years until I turned to drugs. The only thing i knew back then was that i did not want to live the same life as my parents. I used to smoke joints constantly and my weekends were fueled with alcoohol, cocaine, MDMA, ... Well, pretty much anything that seems fun.

During those years, thanks to my good brain, I made it well through high school and went to engineering school afterward. It was during this period that my bad trip happened. It was a really intense experience and all I remember of it today is a constant feeling of imminent death.
Hopefully, I already had some bad moments with drug so I found a safe place and rested it off, but the next day I had some kind of flashback. I calmed myself after a few minutes but it came back again the same day, and the following days.
I did not know what a panic attack was at this time and I was sure it was a physical issue so i went to see a doctor that gave me a soft anxiolytic and explained to me what it was.
So, as it was more of a psychological issue, I started my ""therapy"" mostly to go back to my drug fueled life as I wasn't able to take any drug during those times, I was too afraid to ""break"" myself again.

It was indeed a complicated time but I went through it day after day, listening to my feelings, confronting me to my fears, meeting new people, ... 
Of course, it went better with time and I went back to partying, but only with joints/alcohol and only on evenings, and i finally obtained my diploma without any trouble.
I quickly landed an interesting job and I chose a new goal : Work hard until I have enough money to go travel the world for one year.
Things were fine, but not good, i was still anxious and i was still in my momentum of making myself better. Today i know that I was still not in peace with whom i was.
4 years later, the job turned bad due to issues in the company. I knew that i could not stay in this company but i did not know what to do so I preferred to stay.
Everything changed after a trip in a ""poor country"" where i went to see a good friend from high school that was living there. It was really a revelation for me : no stress, no overthinking, just enjoying the moment and being myself. It had been a long time since i had not experienced peace of mind.
So of course, when i went back i quit my job and decided that it was time to be happy and not settle for ""fine"" as I've experienced ""good"". I understood at this time that the main issue in my life was that it was not as satisfying as i wanted to.
This journey made me realize also that i am a sensation seeker, that the main issue with my life was that it was not what i wanted.
Today, I found a new job that i can do remotely from my home, and i decided to go back to spend a year with my friend there. On top of making new experiences, i will also make enough money to live a more luxury life there than the one i have here, where everything is so expensive.
The plan in motion for months now and the only thing i'm left with is boredom (no stress, no anxiety, no sadness). I went back to smoking weed all day, in an attempt to numb myself until i get there, but it is not really working and I'm starting to also drink alcohol every day to amplify the numbness.
Having to live like that right now makes me a bit afraid that this journey is more of an attempt to flee some kind of a problem that i still not have discovered.

TL;DR: Done my own therapy for years. I realized that I'm a sensation seeker type of guy. I have a plan for a year of adventure but until i get there, i'm feeling hoplessly bored and i'm afraid this feeling will not go away.

So, do you have any opinion on my story ? Do you think there is a deeper issue i should explore ?
Also, do any of you have any more healthy way than drugs to cope during this in-between period ? ",02Oct2017,2
44,"Started back uni, loving it. Really am, and its gonna be in a real, kick-ass career with excellent opportunities. Moving to a new bedsit, close to my family in a very nice area so things are improving.

But I feel like a failure, that I've wasted so much time. 31, have a law degree, didn't get into the profession, have no career, chronic pain with a disability, and never been in a relationship.

Fluctuating between blind panic about being single to total apathy, and with a realisation that at this time I feel more like I am trying to get a relationship just to ""keep up with the jones"".

Getting worn out by my family, two chronic alcoholics (mother and brother) who despite getting considerable support from social services, are expecting me to fix any problem and no consideration to how I am doing or what I have going on.

Mostly I just come home from uni, stick the PS4, chat to friends on facebook and watch TV shows.

Have went out to a few social gatherings but find myself bored and going through the motions and just drifting off, and making my excuses and leaving.

Just can't shake the feeling I came to the party too late. I feel like I've came to watch a movie, missed some crucial plot twist, and too embarrassed to ask what the hell is going on.

Does that make sense?

Quite a few of my friends are now married, settled down; and I'm just thinking: ""christ, what the hell have I done with my life?""

A law degree and some proficiency in Mandarin? Not exactly setting the world ablaze with my accomplishments here...",02Oct2017,4

46,"I'm tired of being so sensitive. I'm self-conscious every day and every minute when i'm outside the house. Only thing that helps me feel good is exercise so I'm burning myself with pushing myself to the limit almost every day. It's almost like an autistic obsession or addiction, I don't know, because I only truly feel relaxed after a good workout. It's so bad that I constantly think that I walk weird, look weird, move weird and I probably am because I'm anxious as hell. I'm in constant fight against myself and I am reminding myself that I will overcome this this is just a temporary state and I just gotta push myself through more and more discomfort and I keep doing it but it doesn't get any better so sometimes I feel defeated that I'm unable to change and I will be stuck in this constant struggle forever. How could I stop feeling so inferior and afraid to speak my mind, I almost feel like I'm always trying to fit in and I just can't feel comfortable in my own skin because of that. Maybe I have aspergers or something? I don't know. Thank you guys who read this wall of text.

49,"So I'm a senior this year. I've been having problems with anxiety and panic attacks for years but, it's just getting worse. I'm seeking help through a counselor and meds. But the pills will take a while to kick in and I'm in between therapists at the moment. I can't bring my self to attend school without having a series of panic attacks. My school counselor mentioned I could try this daily mental health clinic. I'd go there daily for 4-8 weeks instead of going to school. Half my time there I'll have therapy and the other half I'll do school work at their facility. I'm thinking about doing it because I hope it will give me a grip on my crap instead of dragging along waiting for my therapist to see me and actually help. I'm just worried going to this program will harm my chances of getting into a good college. I want to be an OB-GYN . Does anyone know if attending this program in place of school for a few weeks will effect me?",02Oct2017,1

51,"I'm not as passionate about things anymore. For example, music has always been my life since I was a kid and I have always planned to have a career in it. After this past summer I have gotten kind of depressed and bogged down with school work and work and I just feel very overwhelmed and like I don't have enough time for my music. I haven't played my instruments in months because of this and now I feel like I'm just getting too behind to even start playing again... I still want to have a career in this but I feel as if so many people are way ahead of me and I can't get motivated. Not only this but I feel less passionate about having fun, doing the things I love, and relationships (friends/family/boyfriend). How do I get out of this bad state of mind? Any tips on how to regain my passion? ",02Oct2017,1
