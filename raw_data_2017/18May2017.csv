5,"I've wrote this post about 5 time's now, but I'm just going to make it very short.

I got bullied all my life in school. Tried to fit in and ended up getting kicked out. Cut off all social media and contacts. I have had no friends for over one year now. Started speaking to myself and even answering back. Really want to kill those who fucked me over and humiliated me. Haven't been in education for nearly two years now. Going to college in September to do a few GCSE's. I have crippling social anxiety. I do manage to go to the gym and do fitness, but everyone keeps themselves to themselves so it's fine. I read books on the bus to avoid making any sort of contact with anyone. A lot of anger inside me. I never smile. I find routine conversation's weird. I see through people's bullshit and emotions. I'm only 16 and I don't really want to live anymore. As an atheist it's peaceful to know that once you die, it's all over. Should I end it or give life another chance? Ohh and I know the government is watching us and I believe in most 'conspiracy theories'. I would see a doctor or something, but these fuckers are just going to judge (Even if they say they won't) and collect more information on me. A bit of advice would a appreciated. Thanks. ☺",18May2017,2
6,"He has type 1 diabetes, mild autism, schizophrenia and depression. He hit himself 2 months ago in the head and since then has been paranoid about dying soon. His fears then shifted to something else, I believe being a burden to our parents and the family. But I know there's something he's isn't saying.

Whenever I try to talk to him and ask him questions, he doesn't answer. And yet he would always ""stalk"" around me or my parents, as if he wants to say something or is afraid of being alone. His nightmares have come back, he now sleeps in my parents bedroom, he wouldn't get out of the house and lost his interest in video games and other hobbies. It has been more than 6 years since he had constant nightmares.

My parents, especially my mom is losing sleep every night and her patience is clearly wearing off. How do I help him open up so I could help him and give him advice?",18May2017,0

9,"So here is a weird one.  These past few months occasionally my mind has been wandering off into la la land.  Normally this isn't a problem as I'm sure this happens to all of us.  Whats making this difficult is these thoughts or scenarios that play out in mind often have something to do with what is immediately happening around me.  For instance the other night I was in the back office of my job.  I ended up sending a fax out to our claims department.  When I asked a coworker about the paper work she handed me to be faxed she said, "" I didn't hand you anything"".  Turns out I didn't fax anything which was confirmed by the job history on my jobs fax machine.

There have been several instances of this at home and work and it seems the frequency is increasing.  So far none of the thoughts have been violent or unrealistic, but I'm really starting to doubt my own memory lately.  I see my psychiatrist in 2 weeks and plan on bringing this up to him.  

I'm currently diagnosed ADHD/BP2 if that info is important. Really just curious on what this sounds like to some people because the results I'm getting with my google-fu are all over the place 😅.

(I'm not asking for a diagnoses I swear.  I like to make notes on whats bothering me before my psych appointment as I'll sometimes leave without asking or ramble for way to long if I'm unorganized.)",19May2017,2

11,"They asked me if I'm okay and why I was supposed to go to the ER, but I said I'd rather keep it private. That probably didn't help me look any better.

So now one of them always calls me ""buddy"" and goes out of his way to eat with me and talk to me. The other one is a little socially distant and awkward, but she wrote a kind note on a food item I ordered. The note said ""with all the love.""

That said, it's not that I don't think about suicide; I just don't know if I want my bosses thinking I do. Part of my fear comes from me being afraid that they'll judge and treat me badly. So in a sense, I don't really care if they know, as long as they treat me right. 

I'm working on getting promoted right now, and I don't want them thinking they can't give me necessary feedback or anything.

Then again, assuming they do think I'm mentally ill/suicidal, I'm happy that they're not treating me worse. Idk.

I feel very awkward, because my bosses intimidate me in the first place, and their weird, new kindness makes me feel like they're being fake.

17,"Now, it is hard to explain for me. But I need to know what is this. Because I have no idea what this is, I might over-explain. I tried Google with lots of different phrases, and it seems as if this needs some human help.

**tl;dr: This is related to getting annoyed when lots of stuff is happening. Because of my specific life, this mostly happens when I'm working on my computer.**

So basically I get annoyed when lots of different programs are open, or I'm doing lots of different things all with lots of specific details. Instead of tackling a problem step-by-step, sometimes you need to do a lot at once, mostly due to time constraints. For example, as a content writer, sometimes I open five Microsoft Word windows and as I type different things about the same topic, I choose which file to put that piece of content in.

1. Suppose I create different headings in all of those, and I also have to do some formatting. This becomes ""too much"" too quickly and I'm on the verge of crushing my teeth into each other.
2. Perhaps I can't do multitasking, but there's more to it. I can't stand the sight of a computer screen with tons of icons. On my desktop, there are just 5 and that too set in small size. The rest of the screen is empty, mostly pure black. This makes me relaxed.
3. I can't handle it (mentally) when lots of tabs are open. I must close what I don't need to feel okay and continue. If, due to some reason, I open a lot of tabs, the ""chaos"" makes me extremely annoyed, unhappy, agitated, and aggressive.
4. Suppose I have two workspaces open -- one where I am doing some downloading, some disk cleanup, and an antivirus scan -- and on the other one, I am doing some college work that requires at least two software and four to five folders open. This exact situation is what I can't take. Once I clear up the college work and close that workspace, I feel much relieved. This relief is uncommon, nobody should feel so much of it for such a small thing.

In all the mentioned stuff, I can ""do"" it easily, but I start clenching my teeth while doing such jobs. I start shaking my head every once a while, as if I'm ""refreshing"" myself to handle the chaos. I think I have a disorder, and not knowing what it is just makes me even more annoyed. I am sure somebody here knows what exactly I have. Thanks.

22,"This is for anyone who is struggling with Mental Health issues. I wanted to share my experiences and hopefully it can help raise awareness or motivate someone who may be suffering in silence to get the help they deserve 💜

""No one can fully understand and empathise with someone who suffers from any sort of mental health problem until they face the same internal struggles, I can be very spiteful at times but I wouldn’t wish that upon anyone.

During dark times, it can feel like there is a war occurring inside your head. You feel like you must literally battle bad thoughts and painful memories. Instinctively humans will always defend themselves no matter what but when this conflict is happening everyday it’s hard not to give up, curl into a ball and let the darkness consume you. It’s a terrifying feeling to give in to your own bad thoughts as they clearly are not your own because why in the hell would anyone purposely think of terrible, depressing things that makes them feel like shit? It’s a very disturbing feeling knowing you can’t control what goes on in your own head. It’s my brain, my mind, my thoughts so why can’t I control them all the time? For me the answer is Depression.

The tiniest thing can set a sufferer off. Someone with a perfectly healthy mind wouldn’t care if they had run out of milk, they can just go get more. To them, leaving the house isn’t a terrifying task, to go into public and interact with other people is a normality to them. Walking through a supermarket is an easy task, not thinking that the milk is always at the back, the furthest distance from the exit in any shop. What if it’s busy? What if someone tries to talk to me? What if I get overwhelmed? How will I make it back to the exit? Why do I feel like this? For me the answer is Anxiety.

To me, depression/anxiety etc. is like an addiction. An addict will never not want their substance, they must fight the urge to give into temptation every day because there is no cure. Personally, I feel mental health issues are similar. I’m not going to pretend to understand what these illnesses exactly are or why they even exist because I don’t know. I just know that I have these problems and will continue to have them for the rest of my life because there is no cure.

We all must become a One Man/Woman Army and fight the internal battle every single day. Days we may stumble and break and be left with the broken pieces of ourselves on the ground but we will always pick up those pieces, put them back together and continue to fight off our inner demons because even though to “normal” people we may seem like the weak ones, we are, most definitely the strongest.

We will not ever be beaten by our struggles, we are the most durable, hardened bad asses on this planet and we will “Always Keep Fighting.” 💜""",19May2017,3

27,"   My whole life i have been struggling. I was the only one of my blood related siblings to be given up for adoption and i am not the youngest or the oldest. Because of that i always felt unwanted although my adoptive parents love me and consciously i know they want me but i cant help but feel abandoned. 
   I went to my first therapy session when i was 9 years old and was put on medication by a psychiatrist for adhd almost immediately. I always stuggled in school although i am a bright girl. 
   At age 14 i was raped and i started cutting myself. At age 16 i was held up at gunpoint and robbed. I started doing drugs after that (weed and then cocaine). At age 18 i lost my dog who was my only friend and companion since i was 4 years old and i compleatly lost my shit. 
   After that i lost all motivation and agreed to go into residential treatment. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and PTSD. I spent 3 consecutive years in a few different programs. I was on countless medications and have dealt with many side effects including significant weight gain. My self confidence was shattered. 
   I worked hard, i was lucky i found the right people to help me. Those 3 years were the worst years and the best years of my life. 
   Now im 23 at a healthy weight, living on my own, weaned off my medication (worked with my doctor on this), working a job, going to school, and in a loving relationship. 
   Growing up it always seemed there was no light at the end of the tunnel. I was ready to give up. I live with the scars on my arms and legs but i hardly notice them anymore. 

Life is good. I can honestly say im happy for the first time. I hope this helped someone, even if its just one person.

33,"Backstory: originally from a south Asian country I was a fairly good student. I came to Japan looking to expand my horizons. I finished my graduate study and I am working in Japan now. I am still in my second year since I started working. I work in engineering field. I am learning to write code for back-end applications regarding IoT tech. 

My problem: I lack the ability to think logically in any situation. I get stuck in a very limited viewpoint until someone points out to me a better effective point of view. I keep making silly mistakes in work. I don't repeat the same mistakes.
 For example: 
         When I am asked to send an email to a supplier about the some changes in the initial prices, I write that that price changes are okay. But I don't think to add the fact that they can go ahead with the order. The supplier had asked for confirmation in the email he sent us about informing about price changes. I recognise that mistake only after my supervisor points it out to me. 
          I measure some data in a laptop. I want to transfer the log files to my desktop pc. I don't think to use the server but instead waste precious minutes by sending them through my mail to myself and opening that mail in desktop. When the files became too heavy for mail attachment I go and ask my supervisor if there is any other method and he sort of incredulously tells me to use the server.....

The above are just a few examples. I can't think clearly before I act. I lack the ability to come up with a logical solution. I keep asking stupid questions promoting incredulous answers. Even though I can learn a algorithm or a method, I lack the ability to think of a way to apply it to solve a problem..

I feel like a failure at the end of every day. Even though everything is going good for me, even though I am excited about the kind of work I do now, I tell myself that I am useless, that I want to kill myself atleast a dozen times everyday.  I hate myself so much for being such a talentless waste of space. I have been feeling this ever since I came to Japan. I want to better myself but I don't know how. I don't understand what is wrong with me. When I talk about these to my mom she says that it's all in my head and that I am a smart person. This kind of thing that she says is impostor syndrome is it not ? Am I really a smart person ? Or atleast an average person. I have zero confidence in myself. I feel like an idiot lacking some basic human cognitive skill. 

I am not sure if this is the right forum to post this, but please, I beg you, please help me. I don't want to drown like this. If this is not the right place please point me to a forum where I can get help. 

Please help.",19May2017,1

35,"23F schizoaffective here. I think my new psychologist crossed the line with me today. After I spoke with him briefly about my history of me being sexually assaulted on various occasions, his questions started getting really weird and I've never had a psychologist ask me these types of questions before.

He told me he thinks I am an easy target for sexual assault because of the way I present myself (shy and low self-esteem). He then started asking me if any of my male family members raped me. I said no! He kept asking over and over again ""are you sure? Do they look at your weird? When they hug you do they hold you weird?"". He asked the same question like 5 times and then just came out and said he thinks I am suppressing memories of my family sexually assaulting me.

THEN the questions got even weirder; ""how many times a week do you masturbate? how many times a week do you look at porn? which men in your life do you think about while you masturbate?"". In the entire decade I've been to therapy I've never been asked these questions. I was really repulsed and upset by the time I left.

I'm at home now and because I'm schizoaffective I get paranoid easily and I'm going to be avoiding my family all week after what he asked. I know nothing happened to me but my body feels really gross after confiding in him about my masturbation habits.

My dad is pretty much a primary caretaker for me right now and if I told him everything this guy asked my dad would be absolutely furious.

37,"I'm new here, apologies for any common courtesy errors. 

I'm 17F if that matters. I am working on getting into therapy, I'm just looking for others with the same issue or insight. 

This has been the case for a few years now and I can't understand why. Basically, I fantasize about being in some huge accident, or having cancer, or some other terrible thing, because I want people to care about me and to worry about me. I wasn't neglected as a child or anything, and I have a pretty good social life, a boyfriend, a few close friends, and lots of acquaintances. I have a job, I work out, I do well in school, so I don't think I'm depressed. I don't feel depressed, at least. 

This bothers me though. I don't want to romanticize terrible things that happen to people, and I'm 100% sure that if it were to actually happen to me I would not like it in the slightest. Obviously I don't want cancer or injury. However there is that part of me that craves people's sympathy, their attention. I imagine people cancelling important plans to visit me at the hospital, people texting me to check how I'm doing, old friends getting in touch. Disclaimer for anyone who's worried: I would never harm myself or intentionally put myself in a dangerous situation. 

I just want some insight, maybe someone has felt like this before too. Am I just a huge drama queen or what? Google and Reddit haven't brought up anything relatable. Any comments appreciated.

38,"I've read articles about social anxiety and I know that many people consider themselves to have it although they confuse it with normal feelings of nervousness. I used to think my fear of being alone in public spaces was normal in high school (I'm now 20) so I never did anything about it, but now I'm experiencing more severe cases of anxiety/panic attacks that inhibit me from going out and interacting with strangers (especially authority figures). I don't have many friends in college and the fear of being around so many people that I don't know at parties keeps me from going out with the friends I do have, and I end up crying in bed by myself most weekends when my roommates are gone. I've been unable to join groups/clubs due to the fear of that initial encounter with a group of people I don't know, which has just kept me more isolated. I stop myself from doing simple everyday actions in public because I don't want to look stupid. I have a difficult time opening up to people about how I'm feeling because I'm afraid that my feelings are invalid or that I'm just overreacting, which allows my fear and anxiety build until I have a complete emotional breakdown.

If there is anything positive I can say about myself, it is that I have never hurt other people. I've never been in a fight. Never hit anyone --

But my mind is scaring me. The only thing to bring me comfort lately is watching videos of suicide, murder, and torture. Nothing has ever made me feel so calm. The meds I used to take never did it. Alcohol and drugs don't do it. But watching these people die has become so pleasing to me. It makes me feel warm and secure.

This is mixing with my constant daydreaming. I'm hardly ever in reality. Loneliness is me, and never having anybody when I was small, I created new versions of me. Better ones! I have love, warmth, and success in my fantasy. I'm stronger -- smarter -- just a better person. A HUMAN. A HUMAN. But it's getting so blurry. Who am I? My fantasies are getting darker. I get hurt in them -- no more better me. A me that gets ripped apart now. A me that kills and hurts people now. 

When people cross me now -- I want to bash them. I imagine shooting the people around me. 

What's wrong with me?

At least I used to be peaceful. My only problem was self hatred and violence. I'm not me. I'm becoming a dangerous monster.
