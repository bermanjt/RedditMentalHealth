0,"People from the UK - what are your experiences of obtaining a mental health related diagnosis through the NHS? I've been wondering about an anxiety/maybe autism related diagnosis for a while and lately it's been getting worse. Part of my problem is that I'm very anxious about going to the GP with this (part of my fear is that they'll just tell me out of hand that there's nothing wrong and refuse to refer me or that I won't communicate properly etc etc).  
I've found in the past that I'm usually more able to cope with situations that cause me anxiety if I'm able to predict them a little in advance and maybe even let them play out in my head a bit before going - would anyone be willing to describe the process to me?",21Jan2017,2

4,"I've had several episodes of depression and psychosis since I was 16. The episode at age 16 was induced from a combination of school related stress and a relationship coming to an end. The last few episodes have been drug induced, mainly occurring when I stop smoking weed every day or most days.

My question is, if I keep seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist, take my meds and not get addicted to weed again, is it likely or possible that I won't have another episode for the rest of my life?

I've used other substances too, mainly lsd, around 40 times, but I'm looking to stop taking that. I don't want to get in trouble with the police. ",21Jan2017,2

6,"Throwaway, of course. 

Okay, let me start off by saying I'm not trying to be edgy or hardcore or whatever here. I don't think what I'll describe below is 'cool'. I have no plans or intentions to end any life. I'm just a random, confused teenage girl looking for help.

I've been experiencing unusual homicidal ideation for about three years (I'm 16 now). Generally it comes in waves- sometimes I can forget about it for a month, but sometimes there will be a really intense week of it. Very rarely (3 times), there have been periods so intense that I was genuinely concerned I would hurt someone. It's been over a year since the last episode of this, though.

The thoughts revolve around killing people I like (not romantically. I also have a preferred 'type' of theoretical victim, if that's useful information), not my family, and never an animal or a child. An example: two years ago, I was sitting behind a friend in a car with a knife in my pocket. I obsessed for 45 minutes straight over cutting his throat. I'm sorry if this is too graphic, but usually they involve watching my victim's terror and eventual resignation. I think it may be a power/control thing? It's not in any way sexual.

Thing is, I enjoy these thoughts on a carnal sort of level. I'm a pretty emotional, empathetic person usually and a humanist, so on a rational level I hate that I have these thoughts, but I do enjoy them. They often pop up uninvited, but they're not exactly intrusive- it's definitely not Harm OCD. It's never been related to anything like anger or jealousy; in fact, I would hate to be so intimate (different, nonsexual intimate. I don't know how to explain this) with someone I dislike. I have been able to find exactly nothing about what this could be. I've talked to one other person (online) who has what sounds like the same thing, and they don't know either. They are on an anti-psychotic, which apparently helps with the frequency and intensity of the ideation.

As you might imagine, the first few instances of these thoughts were pretty upsetting for barely-post-pubescent me (tl;dr I thought I was a terrible person). It took a while to adjust, but I eventually learned to deal with it as a part of myself- albeit a morally abhorrent flaw and a really crappy secret. Seriously, how do you tell, say, a romantic partner about this? I know I'm ill, but I don't even know how to seek treatment once I'm out of the house. I know you can be reported for telling a therapist this kind of thing. Oh, I also don't indulge in snuff or violent images or anything, though I'd most likely enjoy them. Why look for trouble? 

I do have a bit of clinical depression, but my family situation is generally fine and I've never been abused in any way. I'm otherwise a normal, fairly stable teenage girl. I don't know what the heck this is, and I was hoping someone on here might have some idea or advice. I am so sorry if this is the wrong place or I've offended/triggered someone, and I also apologize for the truly horrendous length of this post.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. ",21Jan2017,2

8,"A very close online friend of mine has been prescribed Prozac for her depression.  Unfortunately, she has been having periods where she forgets what she's been doing, what game we've been playing for the past hour, or what we talked about 30 minutes ago.  Tonight, she got extremely scared and nervous about her forgetfulness.

What can I do to help her through these bouts?  Can all I say is that it will be okay?  I'm feeling a little lost and out of my depth here.  Can anyone offer any advice?",21Jan2017,1

12," Pretend you are in a small boat. And you hit a big wave. You fall out of the boat. Now most people, people without a mental illness, they would simply climb back into the boat. But for someone with a mental illness it's different. You hit the water, and unlike a normal person, your instinct isn't to get out of the water. You are more caught up with how the water feels, where it comes from, why it is there. And as you are thinking all these things you are slowly drifting down. You have no other thought on your mind but the water. And before you know it it is all you can think about. By the time you realize your falling deeper and deeper into the cold grasp of the water, it is already to late. You can see the surface, where you should be. But you are too far away. There is no way you could make it. And you might fight. You might try as hard as you can to get back to the surface, to get air that you feel like you so desperately need. But there is no point. You are so completely engulfed by the water that there is no escaping it. So you just simply fall deeper and deeper.
 The water in this metaphor is the thoughts that I, like so many others with OCD, have to deal with every day. The water represents how most people, when having a thought that we do, just simply dismiss the thought and carry on. But when you have OCD it is so much harder than that. The thought becomes the only thing your mind can focus on. It becomes your sole focus. It grows and grows the more you think about it and it becomes you. By the time you realize you are falling into the feelings you know so well to be anxiety, it is already too late and the thought has total control of your mind. All you can do is sit there as the thought torments you and breaks you down over and over. No matter how hard you try to shake it. ",21Jan2017,1
13,"Need some advice 

I live in a smaller town with a shit hospital and on Tuesday night I attempted suicide and was taken to the hospital 
They then admitted me involuntary 

They then left me in an ER  room for 2 days with no therapy or medication then came to me today and said Doctor:""are you safe to go home"" 
Me:""I really don't think I am""
Doctor: ""well we are going to send you home and if that's what you choose to do then I can't stop you so you are going to have to learn to live with this feeling""

I am not fucking lying 
My councillor is writing up an official complaint 

And now I don't know what to do I'm still really unsafe but it no one seems to care 

I'm sorry for the rambling I'm just trying to distract myself from well myself

I requested to be transferred to another hospital they said no 

And my councillor that's not associated with the hospital was told by the nurse that I am manipulating everyone and I am not sick at all 
I have had documented mental illness since I was 16 and have attempted suicide 2 times 6 months ago I got very very close and was admitted to another hospital (lived somewhere else) I was there for 6 weeks and got much better for a time 
I'm sorry if this is hard to understand I can't focused right now  ",21Jan2017,1

19,"I was 19 years old when my grandfather was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  He was my entire world.  He was the only father figure/male role model I had growing up.  Rather than having his family see him suffer, waste away, and die in such a terrible way, he chose to put a bullet in his brain and end his suffering.  I found the body.  I still remember how he looked with his head slumped over covered in his own blood with the .22 rifle leaning against his legs.  Although I have never been professionally diagnosed, I know that I suffer from PTSD.  I still have the nightmares, the sounds of gun shots or loud noises send me into panic attacks, and every February 10, the day he died, I spend the entire day majorly depressed and crying.

Part of me wants to seek professional help to deal with the events of that day, but after carrying around the emotional baggage for almost 20 years, I feel like the damage caused by that day have become a permanent part of my personality.  What do you do when the scars from the worst day of your life become a part of who you are?",21Jan2017,2

22,"I've been having issues with my mental health that have been getting steadily worse for about 2 years now. I don't feel comfortable divulging all of my problems in a psychologists office - the list just goes on and on. I would *only* see a psychiatrist for one thing, which is my memory/attention/motivation. These past six months or so in particular it's just gotten so much worse, and I can't keep going on like this as a college student. I used to be able to write 15 page papers in one day, now I can't write anything anymore, and when I do it feels very forced, it doesn't flow naturally like it used to. When I have something I need to read for class, I can read a paragraph before I can't go any further, it literally feels physically painful to keep going. I have so much trouble paying attention in class, the words drift in one ear and go out the other. I feel like I've literally become stupider, that my IQ has dropped ten points since the start of this school year. I've always been pretty intelligent (only had my IQ tested once and all I know is that it was north of 130), so this has been devastating for me. 

I'm getting desperate. I *don't* want to go down the long road of experimenting with various antidepressants, trying to find one that works without turning you into a zombie and dealing with all of the unpleasant side effects that go along with this trial and error period (which can sometimes last a year or more). I want something that will work *now*. Some sort of stimulant like adderall seems to be the best solution. All I ever hear about it is that it greatly improves your attention, focus, and work ethic with few negative side effects. I don't have an addictive personality and I'm committed to using it responsibly. 

I'm willing to lie to get something to help with my cognitive issues. I just don't know where to start or what to say.",21Jan2017,6

26,"I feel like I am going crazy. My life feels like insanity. The longer i keep going the more I feel myself be torn apart. I am surrounded by people, but cannot talk to any of them. Nobody would listen or understand, even if they did they couldn't help me. It feels so cruel to know people are near you, but no matter how desperate you are you can never get them to understand your struggle.

I think about suicide every single day. I have no other solutions to this mess I am in. I call the Samaritans and they make me feel worse. They tell me they cannot help me because I've already made my mind up, or tell me I could speak to them all day, but nothing is going to change anything so hang up anyway. I just want someone to listen and to understand when I feel so strongly that nothing can save me. Just someone to listen to my thoughts and to get my feelings out would bring me comfort, even if suicide seems the only option it's still a relief until then.

I sit here totally isolated from the world. Nobody to call, nobody to talk to. Nobody to help me. Nothing anyone says brings me any comfort because they're just empty words. People say ""it'll get better"", HOW THE HELL DO YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T, YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER.

I am going to die because I can't live like this much longer. I can't cope with this ridiculous mess my life turned out to be. I live without reason, without love and without connections with people. It's beginning to feel too painful too just exist. I want to end it all. Not because i want to die, but because there is NOTHING I can do to change myself or to sort out my shattered and hopeless life.

My therapist says that I am articulate. That I am attractive, funny, intelligent. That I have so much to give to the world. That she enjoys my company blah blah. I can't help but feel she could look at a serial killer and still find nice words to say about them. I cannot accept anything she's saying to me. I don't believe a damn thing. It tears me apart thinking she's sitting there lying to my face. It makes me hurt even more that she actually thinks I believe her. She clearly doesn't know me or understand me and she is the only person who should.",21Jan2017,7
