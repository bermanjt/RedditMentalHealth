0,"I'm a senior at the University of Michigan applying to MSW programs and I'm trying to decide how many I should apply to.

I currently have a 3.166 overall GPA (3.4 psychology) but with an 3 credit A+ this term and 14 credits in the fall I plan to get A's in it should go up to at least a 3.2.

I have some experience volunteering this summer and I'll be volunteering at 3 places this fall and I'll have a year or so of research experience in one lab (which also includes human service ex: running a clinic). This summer I volunteered in a lab running participants in experiments and will be working in another this fall transcribing interviews on sexual assault in college. I have fairly strong writing skills.

I am planning to apply to 4 in-state schools: University of Michigan (1), Wayne State (38), Michigan State (32), and Western (71).
I've compiled a list of out of state schools I'm interested in along with their ranking and cost that I'll list here in case anyone has any insight into the programs there:

(3) University of Washington: $33,732. 


(10) Boston College: $35,520. 


(10) University of Pittsburgh: $30,540. 

(12) Boston University: $33,280. 

(12) University of Wisconsin - Madison: $25,314. 

(17) University of Illinois: $29,238. 

(17) University of Maryland - Baltimore: $35,000. 

(22) Fordham University: $27,210. 

(22) Rutgers University: $28,656. 

How many would you apply to if you were in my position?

So I've had a quite turbulent past couple of years. I'm 21 now and I started taking medication for depression and slight anxiety when I was 17. The first one I took was celexa, going from 10mg to 30mg in a 4 year period. It worked wonders for the first year and then it was just okay, and the last year was just awful. My anxiety was through the roof And I couldn't stop bombarding myself with negative thoughts. So about 5 months ago I switched to Wellbutrin sr 150mg, and its be okay I guess. I feel like it's alleviated most of my depression but my anxiety, irritability, and negative thoughts have gone through the roof in the past two months. 
Throughout all of this I have had an extremely helpful girlfriend, but I have put her through so much, I've always given her the blunt of all my terrible feelings and she's always been so caring. We have had an amazing relationship but I have put such a strain on us that we are no longer together. We are taking time to work on ourselves, and we badly want to be together, there absolutely no hard feelings. We're best friends and we have and inseparable bond. We have agreed to not speak for the next two months to work on ourselves (her sister passed away 3 years ago and has been pushing it under the rug for a while, something she needs to finally emotionally process to heal), and see then see what's up and make more decisions from there. 
So all that being said, I want to get better. I want to be a strong, confident, happy, calm, loving person. I want to be stable. I want to be comfortable hangout with myself all day everyday and to stop body shaming myself. I do not feel like my medication is the solution to my problems. Tomorrow I want to talk to my doctor about stopping the Wellbutrin. I want to see a therapist. I know working out and eating healthy helps but I'd like some more suggestions. I've heard about cbt but I've never read up on it. I bought some cbd oil today, taken it before for a short about of time I know it help at least slightly. Do you think this is possible without medication? Also I hope this isn't being put off as me just getting better so we get back together, I am %100 aware that we may not get back together. But it's made me realize just how much all of my behaviors have gotten out of control. It is not normal and I can not be happy this way. I guess I'm just looking for some extra input and support, thank you in advance. ",16Aug2017,2
5,"So, I've been on and off borderline suicidal for over a year and last year when I was at my worst I walked up to a group of my closest friends and told them how I felt and they all just stared at me. Not like they were shocked or worried, but kinda like that look you give the person who is annoying you.

What I told them was that I wanted to drop out of high school and finish my classes online because I was bullied and I constantly had suicidal thoughts. I emphasized that I would finish school, but it would be online and they all told me it was a terrible idea. One of them said they would never see me and that was their whole reason to why I shouldn't do schooling online. My boyfriend basically said if I were to drop out I would never finish schooling and I would never get a job and I would have to live in the slums for the rest of my life. One of my closest friends told me I was overreacting and that dropping out now would just be a waste of time since I was already in 11th grade. So, she told me to suck it up and be suicidal for another year. 

My senior year starts on Friday and I'm absolutely petrified because of those responses to what happened last year. I never got any help from professionals or anybody because my older sister thinks I'm just hormonal and my mom thinks I'm a liar. So, I'm still having suicidal thoughts ALL the time. I've had them all summer long and I'm actually worried I might try to kill myself. So, I was going to check myself into a psychiatric hospital without telling my family and today I read some reviews of the one I was planning on going to. Well, the reviews were awful. There were stories of the staff mixing up patients meds, patients beating up others and the staff doing nothing about it, and the staff insulting patients. For someone else this might only be a minor set back because they can just find another hospital to go to, but this is the only hospital in my town. I live in a very small area and would have to drive for at least 15 minutes to come to another town, but I don't have a car and nobody else would be willing to take me to a psychiatric hospital. So, my problem is I'm probably going to kill myself if I don't get into a hospital, but the only one I'm able to get to is the one with terrible reviews and careless staff. Please help me, I don't know what to do.



TLDR; I told my friends and family I was suicidal and they basically told me to get over it. I need to go to a psychiatric hospital or I'm probably going to kill myself, but the only one possible for me to get to has very very bad patient reviews. I need advice.",16Aug2017,7

9,"I'll start with the problem first. (sorry this post is really redundant and tough to read. Usually, I'd be better about this but just a little anxious) 
 

A week ago I hit the one month mark of maintaining one to three hours of sleep a night. I'm not completely in the dark and so I know, at that point, your mind and body should begin to act poorly due to the deprivation. I take this into consideration. It was also a week ago, that I woke up from my, already poor, sleep schedule with this nagging feeling that my torso didn't belong to me. I felt uncomfortable and the feeling was so unbearable that I didn't actually go back to bed. I stayed up till day break and then it eventually dispersed. I went about my day and then night hit again. Same situation except, now, I hadn't slept at all. My torso began to feel more uncomfortable than the night before and so, once again, I couldn't go to bed. The whole month up to this point I was getting at least a few hours of sleep a night. Now I was getting ZERO. Mind you, I'm a fairly sane gal. I still KNOW well enough to understand that this is so clearly my own torso and it wouldn't make sense or be possible that I would actually have another person's torso in place of my own. Unfortunately, knowing that isn't enough to stop my body from feeling otherwise. By night three I was so insanely sleep deprived that I decided to take four water bottles, freeze them, and then fall asleep on them as a way to ""numb"" my body? I guess? for lack of better wording. To me, this was a last resort preventative measure I NEEDED to take. I had spent the whole day prior, feeling like the best way to overcome my odd torso feeling was to take a knife and cut it open. My mind was actually telling me that this, for whatever reason, would alleviate the discomfort. I sort of fought myself here and decided I knew well enough to be scared by that mindset and also took note that it wasn't healthy. 
           Thus, the water bottles came to rescue as a last resort. That night I got a full 8 hours and it had been the first time in the past month that I actually had rest. It was SO nice.
But then day broke and the feeling kind of hit me 10x over in order to compensate for missing me at night. I looked to google who told me this is dissociation but it just feels a ton different. Aside from this, I've been feeling odd about other people. Any one that I'm close to, gives me an uneasy feeling once in a while. I'll look at my mom's face while she's talking and suddenly, even though nothing has physically changed, it just feels different. Less kind. Like someone else is behind it and they're untrustworthy.This isn't new but rather magnified lately. I just draw away from people when this kicks in because I don't want to make them uncomfortable with how blatantly weird I feel towards their face haha. I also am aware that's not healthy. I'm pretty decent at acknowledging these things but I just get really poor anxiety when trying to explain it to a professional. I think I get nervous that they'll think I'm lying about it all in order to get medication. I know that's a thing. And my fear of that kind of over takes my ability to function normally. So I just need help from those of you with experience in these areas. How have you worded these struggles? Can you help me do it with more eloquence, if at all? Side note: feel free to add on to anything else I've said in this post if you feel like there are some things I should know that I'm very clearly missing lol.

 

ADDITIONAL INFO IN REGARDS TO WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD SEEK HELP.

I posted here about a month ago (for the first time ever in my history of Reddit) about my poor sleep schedule and I managed to get a response that was insanely helpful. Since then, I haven't managed to fix my insomnia but I HAVE managed to find a psychiatrist who will take me on. I've yet to meet her and this is all fairly new so, for now, I'm playing a waiting game while we try to figure out availability. I've always struggled with depression and not much else. Lately, it feels like it's developing into something different and I can't tell if it's due to my new found lack of sleep. Because of this, I was scared into seeing a professional again. That being said, I know this is something I should talk to a professional about and I AM GOING TO but I'm having a hard time explaining it. I'm coming to you folks because google isn't doing the job and I know I'll kick myself in the ass when I'm not able to properly place my words in this situation.

10,"This summer has been one of the hardest of my life. It began in May when two of the five people in my department quit. My workload doubled and there was little I could do to relieve my stress. Later that same month, my grandmother was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer, and she was given three months to live. 

The news of my grandmother prompted my husband and I to start discussing future plans, and we decided to begin looking for a house in June (probably not the best choice looking back). This process went much quicker than expected, and we found a house in a matter of weeks (end of June). We started the escrow process, and several delays by the lender caused additional stress.

At the same time as we were in escrow, the other two members remaining members of my work team left for three weeks of coinciding vacation. I was left managing the workload of five people on top of my personal life stresses. Right in the middle of this time, my grandmother died. Funeral plans began and we finished closing on our house (and quickly moving in). My coworkers finally returned from vacation just in time for me to attend my grandmother’s funeral (this past weekend). 

I thought I would experience some relief following the funeral and return of my coworkers, but I am entirely burnt out. I haven’t slept soundly in months, and I am an emotional wreck.  I feel like I am loosing my mind and I don’t know how to begin healing. I’ve asked for a few days off work (manager was very supportive), but I am having a hard time processing my thoughts (and now have the added guilt of missing work).

Any advice on how to get my life back on track? Should I feel bad about missing work?

I have suffered from anxiety for the past few years and I am just now making my first effort to talk to someone and hopefully get the problem under control. I suffer from anxiety which seems to be getting worse, to the point where it is starting to effect my life more than it was before.


I want to try CBT counseling, but I also want to talk to a psychiatrist and maybe try some meds- I am not sure how I am mentally and I feel like I may have another problem which is causing my anxiety, possibly ADHD or maybe depression.


 I am wondering - should I make an appointment with a psychologist who does CBT counseling and then also a psychiatrist to maybe talk about some meds or getting some mental evaluation done on my brain? Or should I just talk to a psychiatrist who also does CBT counseling? Like I said, this is the first time I am doing anything like this, so I am not sure where to start, but I called my insurance and got a list of doctors, so now I just need to make some calls, etc.


I have never taken any medication for my anxiety. I have tried xanax and propranolol, both of which do nothing to help my anxiety. I have never been tested for ADHD (even when I was a kid) but I feel like I may have that as well. My anxiety mainly stems from social anxiety which then creates general anxiety that is effecting my life more and more in a bad way.

19,"So. There's me. 
I'm aware I'm not all there. Told I have anxiety and depression but honestly the best thing that fits from research, a lifetime of personal experiences and other first hand accounts of people with the diagnosis is borderline.
But I'm not formally diagnosed... so we'll keep a pin in that.

We also have my aunt. A self absorbed tyrant who throws her bottle out the pram every time she wants something and it isn't done immediately and who likes to play at being a martyr. Told she was schizo affective more like bpd and narcissistic but she has believed that the TV was sending her special messages before now.


I wanted to get help. I tried. I failed.
The NHS failed me, she failed me. They didn't listen and instead said it was for attention. Even when I got to the point of downing about 100 paracetamol and slicing my leg up. She saw this as me trying to show her up as a bad parent. 

Either way I'm now just here. I exist but I'm not happy about it and have no one to turn to.


One time she thought I'd stolen a tin of her tuna (we buy spectate groceries) but I hadn't. She didn't approach me and ASK. No she decides to just kick my door open and scream at me. Because she couldn't be mad at me because of the tuna it because about how I had disposed of its tin... and then because I hadn't emptied said bin. In others just wanting any damn reason to have a go at me.

Never go a sorry... just pretended it didn't happen. And this is a somewhat regular occurrence until I got my current job where I spend 90% of my time out the house.


Cue to this weekend. I'm super stressed from work, I'm not sleeping, I'm starting to hallucinate and have panic attacks. I decide to take some time off. Hang with friends for a few days and just chill. I tell Aunt because I don't want her to worry or think I've just ditched and run away again. (Yep I literally packed a bag and left my life when I was 18, this was about 6 months before the paracetamol situation)  she responds with anger. I should have told her in advance. She has a list of shit for me to do and expects me to drop everything to come do.


...no.
This act of rebellion may make me homeless or in deep shit for a few weeks but the whole point of taking time away was not to spend it reenacting cinder-fucking-ella.

I know already she will bitch about just how much she does for me, while she also blames me for everything wrong in her life. Again, let me remind you, she is my Aunt, not my mother. She made a choice a long time ago... I didn't make it for her. Not a martyr.
She claims I'm running up the bills... with the one time a week I cook, the one lot of washing and drying I do. The daily 5 minute shower and once a week 15 minute so I can wash my hair and shave ect. In the 3 hours a work night I'm conscious in that house...


I'll admit, my rooms an utter fucking state... but it's just clutter. It's empty water bottles and junk on the floor.
It's a very small room (single bed, fits along the short wall, long wall is maybe a foot longer than that) so it gets messy real quick. I'm a lazy person and I just don't care. I'm more concerned in distracting myself away from the realisation I'm going to wake up at 40 in exactly the same position I am now, broke and having done nothing with my life.


I spend £500 of my wage every month for this tiny ass room.
Yeah that includes rent, utilities and WiFi but every person I've ever mentioned this too says it's too high.

If I could afford to move out I would but it seems impossible to get £1000 together to get out. (Bond, 1st months rent and some furniture cause I own nothing.) But everyone I make progress something comes along and fucks it up.
I currently have managed to forage away £150 but now my glasses need replacing. So really there goes that.


I'm just so frustrated and don't really know what to do anymore. The longer I stay in this repetitive loop the further from reality I get just to stop myself from killing myself. 
I'd move in with friends but that would probably kill the friendship and really I want my own space. Plus as soon as I leave that's it. No going back.

23,"Basically my situation is messing with my mind and I don't know if I have a serious illness (schizophrenia, delusions of persecution, maybe even a personality disorder). 



From my perspective:

Ex raped me, I wanted nothing to do with him, he has been stalking me online for a few years. I am currently trying to get a restraining order against him so he stops messaging me.



But in reality:

Ex is denying (to the police) that he did these things, and the times he did, I misunderstood his intentions and that the things he said online were not directed at me. There is some disagreement about the facts (e.g. if I think he called me 5 times, he says in actuality he only called me twice) as well as the interpretation of said facts (e.g. him sending a public tweet @ me is not direct contact).



I feel really out of control when my perception does not match up to his reality. From his statements to police, he seems quite calm and measured in all of this (and confused that I have gone to the police over what he considers harmless actions). In comparison, I am completely hysterical, I have days when I just cry all day because I feel triggered by what I perceive to be a phone call.



Police have not concluded their investigation so I cannot point to the facts of whose reality is right to settle if I am having a delusion or not. But honestly I just don't trust my own interpretation of things, I know I have always had a tendency to overreact to things and be quite anxious and over-emotional. I do not feel sane.



I have tried to reach out to mental health crisis workers but I keep getting referred back to a rape counselling service (my counsellor from there, while lovely and very helpful in other ways, has not been able to help me on this because she is not a psychiatrist).



Here are my questions:

- Is there a checklist for common disorders which would allow me to narrow down what is wrong with me?

- Are there any signs to look for to determine what is really happening and what is just me being a bit crazy?

- How do I get help? I think I should go to a doctor and need a diagnosis and probably medication, but I am not sure what I should say or what to ask for. I have never had a mental health issue before so I am a bit lost.

26,"Since I started researching this issue I think I have accustomed myself with a lot of the theory on the origins, the purpose, the triggers and the mechanism of action and the way of treatments of shame, however I feel really stuck when it comes down to actually healing my toxic shame. 

The latest research and the modern day consensus is that self-compassion, empathy with oneself and self-acceptance is the antidote. 

I have tried several popular exercises but I am unable to enter the grieving state or the self compassion state. I do not know how to access my emotions. I can do the exercises on a mental/intellectual level but I feel cut off from my feelings and apathetic all throughout. Thus, I do not experience any emotional relief and my shame thrives. 

One insight I had once I was trying to do the mirror exercise suggested by Nathaniel Branden (in which you look at yourself in the mirror and practice self acceptance by repeating certain slef-acceptance phrases) is that I have an immense resistance towards accepting myself as I am especially accepting my physical appearance. And I contemplated if the reason for my failure to have self compassion is more due to me not wanting to accept myself rather than not being able to find a way how to. 

So I am stuck at the phase of not knowing how to make myself not want to self sabotage my healing process and resist wanting to accept myself and my flaws.",17Aug2017,1
27,"Hi folks, 

Feels weird reaching out as a natural recluse but for the past 18 months I have been virtually isolated from the world due to being unemployed.

I live in a sleepy village where I grew up and all my friends have moved on and most young people are gone so there is nothing here. 18 months ago I lost my job, apartment(back at parents), girlfriend and basically what I would consider everything.

I have been fortunate recently to get back to my feet. I have secured a decent corporate job in the capital and will work on myself while there. Socially I am awful, I have done nothing compelling with my life. I have no real life experience so it's hard to think of anyway to strike up conversation with people, I really want to reach out and find friends but I don't want people to befriend me to help me. I'm lost.

Over the past 6 months I have become extremely irritable and have flashes of blind rage. I was never like this. I have destroyed my bedroom(which sounds quite teenage) but its the only place I go/stay I even eat here. I have fixed it up only to destroy it again and again and today I done it again.

I want to know if it will get better? I won't see a psychiatrist as its not something I can afford. I just want to know if it does get better? If i'm not too far gone? I am disgusted with myself for being this way and don't want to leave for a good job if I am going to be troubled in it.

One Year

How can a single year be so monumental?

How can you measure a single year of a single life?

525,600 minutes?

One year ago i was in the middle of the last week of the four worst weeks of my life. 

One year ago I lost. I was broken.

It was Friday, August 19th. I left work a shell of myself. I had nothing left, no defenses, no mental tricks, no emotions. I sat in my car and cried for nearly 15 minutes. I thought if I could only make it home I would be okay, home is where the bed is. Home is where I could hide and recharge, maybe next week wont be as bad, I just have to make it home and then next week will come. 

On the drive home, as I approached a freeway offramp, I saw one of those blue signs indicating a hospital is at this exit. I wondered to myself how you check into the hospital, do you walk up to the desk and say you need to be put under a suicide watch? I approached and passed a second exit for the same hospital. As soon as I was beyond the second offramp the ""demon"" that was the manifested hatred of my brain towards myself said ""I win"".

That is when my mind fractured. ""I"" was no longer in control, I was there and I was watching what was happening but it was not ""me"". I do not remember arriving at home. I was sitting in my chair, something was on the TV, i have no idea what. I had picked up my laptop and started surfing the web like I normally would every night. Time passed. I did not eat. I noticed that somehow websites about suicide had come up on my laptop screen. Not the good don't do it sites, these were the if you are going to do it make sure you do it right sites.

Midnight passed. There on the screen is a chart detailing the lethal overdoses of various medications. There is Percocet. The amount listed seemed reasonable. I found myself opening the drawer that holds all of my pills. Percocet's! They were left overs from a surgery. The bottle opened. A count was made. Enough. But only just. A bottle of over the counter sleeping pills. Together more than enough. 

That is the moment. That is when my body stopped my brain. That is when I could hear the blood moving through my veins. That is when I felt every cell in my body. That is when I heard, from somewhere, ""Not Yet."" I do not know if it was merely a thought or if i said it aloud. Not Yet. I took all of the pills and flushed them. I had lost the fight but my body saved me. My body was not willing to give up the fight. Not Yet.

I realized that I needed to get help. Not Yet. I had to solve the problem of my brain. I don't hate me, my brain hates me. Not Yet. Months long wait for an appointment. Not Yet. Finally ""The Doctor will see you now"". Not Yet. The Doctor says ""you're bipolar"" but I just came because of depression. Not Yet.

Follow this treatment plan. Pills so many pills. Not yet. My mind begins to clear. The pain of existence slides away. I haven't thought about suicide for a month, for two months, four months, SIX months! Not Yet. 

Tuesday, August 15th 2017. My mind is clear. I am at a concert, my favorite band is performing. I am with friends. I am smiling. I feel ""normal"". 

One Year. 

Not Yet.

I am haunted by the statement of that night. Not Yet. 

Not Yet will never be. Not Yet keeps me taking my pills, in what feels like handfuls at a time. Not Yet is a bitch. 

525,600 minutes. How do YOU measure a year? 

My marker is from a fractured mind tortured by the darkest depressive episode of my life, suicidal ideation so thick and insistent nearly every waking thought was occupied by it. From there to peace and content, happiness and stability, friends and music. One year.

I do not know how many years I have left. Not Yet. But this past year has been pretty fucking great.

I recently got a second job and i make about $500 a month too much to get full coverage, so they put me on a different plan than only covers stuff to do with my vagina. No mental health care.

Even though I have two jobs I can't afford a lot of the stuff I see, money is really tight right now but I need help as soon as I can get it. 

I'm 19 years old, my income a month is about $1200 but a lot of that goes to bills. I live in NC if that helps any. 


If i can't get any kind of insurance my plan is to just say fuck it and go to the hospital without health insurance.

Any advice, anything would be helpful",17Aug2017,1
33,"More than ten years ago, while in upper secondary school, I got very depressed and for the first time went to see a psychologist. Since then, I have done behavioural psychotherapy, psychoanalysis and been admitted to a clinic. I have taken antidepressants for some years. I have achieved a lot of things during the last ten years, and much of it I owe to therapy. I have an education, a job, I am in a stable relationship with a loving girlfriend.

Yet all of this has had little effect on how I feel on a day-to-day basis and on my recurring depressive episodes. It seems to me that no therapist has ever really understood my condition, nor have I. In psychoanalysis I learnt a lot about myself, but still did not get closer to understanding my problems. In behavioural therapy we never seemed to make any progress. The behaviour we were working on always appeared to be rooted in something deeper that would not let it change.

Let me say right away that I know the attitude of the patient plays an important role. I have really tried to attend therapy with an open mind, and many times have I felt we've been on to something. Still, in the long run I was never able to get rid of a fundamental doubt about whether we were really recognizing the real problem. It is from the viewpoint of that doubt I am trying to describe my condition here. I'm not saying everything I describe below is abnormal. I mention what I think might be relevant to understanding myself better.

My hope is that someone will recognize some core thing(s) better than I or my therapists have been able to. I am not expecting definite answer or a quick fix. But I sincerely hope that we together can reach some insight that will help me deal with my problems in a better way than I have been able to until now.

I am grateful for anyone that dedicates some of their time to help me and will gladly answer questions and try to explain things more clearly if someone asks me to. This is the first time I try to reach out online.

* * *

I'm not able to focus on one thing. My mind constantly wanders. It's not that I have compulsive thoughts, only that new thoughts constantly pop into my head. This can lead to interesting inquiries, but it also makes it impossible for me to stick to a single thing.

When I was writing assignments in university, my thoughts, or my focus of interest, would lead me from one mini-inquiry to another. It was interesting and exciting, but it was also very time-consuming. In the end I had to spend a lot of time and energy constructing a thesis out of all the different mini-inquiries.

I like to read insightful texts. But I catch myself skipping essential information, like my attention just scans the text for interesting bits. Sometimes I have difficulties understanding a passage because I missed essential information previous in the text (like the name of a person). After I have read it, I often can't recollect much of it. This was also a problem when I was studying. I would have a hard time learning new things in an orderly fashion.

It's similar when I talk to people. Often I'm only interested in one aspect of what they are saying. I simply discard information that does not appear to be interesting or important.

This probably accounts a lot for why I find no pleasure in reading books. I can read about books and look forward forward to read them, but when I finally get my hands on them I quickly end up bored. I don't know what it means to get lost in a book. Obviously I'm doing something wrong, but I wouldn't know how to do it correctly. I can enjoy (some) movies and TV series. Presumably because motion pictures takes a lot of work off one's imagination compared to books.

When I try to reenact something in my mind, the result is very fragmented. I can't clearly picture something I've seen or replay an experience in a fluid way. Most elements I must consciously recall. They don't follow by themselves. And I constantly catch myself skipping essential ones. Unsurprisingly, I find it hard to paint from imagination. Also describing the details of a scene (what someone was doing, how they were doing it, how they looked) is very difficult for me.

For all I know, this might be the way it is for a lot of people. Though oddly enough, my dreams (in my sleep, not daydreams) are vivid and without the defects mentioned above, and I wonder why that is. Furthermore, the feeling I get when I try to force myself to paint or tell about what I have no clear picture of is a feeling I know all too well.

I am uncertain about what I think, or feel, about a lot of things. I can have a vague notion in one direction or another, but I'm seldom convinced. It feels so foreign to me to be confident about something. (An exception is when I see a logical connection.) If someone disputes my notion I easily start to doubt it myself. The ultimate consequence of my insecurity is that I can't say I'm happy about my life or about anything. I have never had serious suicidal thoughts. I have never thought the world would be better off me. But realizing I can't say I'm happy to be alive worries me and makes me profoundly sad.

I don't like to appear insecure, so I try to hide it. Of course this makes a lot of social interactions uncomfortable. For example, when someone asks me whether I like it here, my thoughts could be: 'I don't know. I mean, I guess so. I don't dislike it. (Or maybe I do?) Well this and that is nice.' Then I mention those two things that are nice, which could count as a yes. And feel a bit uncomfortable because I'm not so sure about what I just said.

I doubt embracing this insecurity of mine would make things better. (It's not like I never admit I'm unsure either.) Insecurity leads to indecisiveness and inaction, and often that is simply not an option. 'I probably love you. I mean, you're the person I like to be with the most, so that must mean I really, really like you. It's just that I don't have a feeling that's so clear I can be sure it is love.'

My feeling of insecurity does not dominate everything, but it's always there. I have tried to ignore it, to not let it impair me. This works only (somewhat) when I feel well. It takes a lot of energy, and when I'm ill it's impossible. Being confident is something I have day dreamt about a lot. In some situations, for some time, I can be, but I always return to my insecurity. I also have difficulties expressing myself, for example through dance. I know I have to let myself go, but I have no idea how to do it. This is not primarily due to a fear of exposing myself in front of others. I'm not able to do it by myself either.

When I feel well, doing nothing bores me. I have ideas, plan things, work on projects (mostly new ones, or approach old ones from a different angle). Like I said above about writing assignments, my interests keep me busy and take me in new directions. Still, what excites me is this high activity in itself, not what it results in. (I can be excited about trying to understand how something works, but when I find out, it's like I didn't care in the first place.) Then my energy diminishes, I feel tired, lose my interests and get depressed. When I'm depressed, I don't think less of myself, but I don't have the energy or to engage with the world around me, or much interest in it.

In a way it seems like an important part of me always longs towards the depressed state of inactivity. When I'm upbeat I'm too busy to notice, but it's like deep inside of me the thing that I want the most would be to just lie down, do nothing and have total peace. I imagine that if I only allow myself, and manage, to do absolutely nothing, I will come to peace with myself. That also makes me very reluctant to actually force myself to do something, because that is irreconcilable with attaining this total peace. Which I never attain anyways. After a day or two or more I eventually get less exhausted and slowly return to normality. (I wouldn't say I'm lured into depression. When it arrives, I mostly willingly surrender to it. But before or later I have to surrender. I can't simply ignore it.)

That reminds me of another thing. I don't have any positive goals. My goal is the absence of negative things. When I reach a goal, say climbing a mountain, I don't get a good feeling. I more like I simply take note of that I've done it.

I indicated above I tend to start new things, not return to old ones. In a way I can't comprehend my previous interest for a thing. I have recurring interests, but I don't stick to one of them for a longer time. Also when I have a great time with someone, the feeling quickly wanes afterwards. I don't doubt I had a great time, I remember I was literally thinking 'I'm having a great time', but it's like the emotional content of the memory is gone. Since I don't feel anymore how great something was, I lack that motivation to do it again. Here thoughts are a lot less convincing that emotions.

This no doubt contributes to my passive life. When I'm not feeling so well (which is often the case), socializing feels like a burden. It is exhausting. And when I manage to push myself to do it anyways and it's actually fun (which is not a given), emotionally that means nothing to me afterwards. I can remember uncomfortable situations, and doing that is uncomfortable, maybe even traumatic. But a recollection of something nice is devoid of emotion.

* * *

Some therapists have suspected I have a disorder in the Autism spectrum. This was thoroughly examined during my clinical stay and the therapists reached a negative conclusion. As a teacher I mostly really enjoy the social interaction with my students (assuming I feel well) and my students like me. If I talk over their heads, I usually notice myself immediately. I can understand and deal with other persons' emotions quite well. (I'm mentioning what I think might disqualify me for a Autism spectrum diagnose. I do not pretend to really know how a person with that diagnose would act, feel or think differently.) Still, I seek to avoid many social interactions. I procrastinate a lot.

Due to my problems with concentration I have wondered about adult ADHD. The characteristics 'lack of persistence in activities that require cognitive involvement, and a tendency to move from one activity to another without completing any one' (from the ICD-10) do make sense on some level, but none of the other do. Also, no therapist has ever said something in that direction. In the end, I have only been diagnosed with different depressive disorders. My plan at the moment is to attend a course in mindfulness, hoping that I can become better at focusing on one thing/getting in touch with my emotions

How can I write this much about myself and still feel I don't understand what I'm dealing with? How can I write it and when I say I feel I can't really express myself. (My explanation of the latter is that somehow I *can* overcome my fears and somehow confront my emotions. But I do it in a specific, indirect way. It's like I observe them from behind a protective glass.) It's similar to when I encounter poetic language. On some level (not only literally) I understand it, but it has no, or hardly any, emotional impact on me.

Thank you for reading this! If you have thoughts about what I'm dealing with, I would be so grateful to hear them.",17Aug2017,1

35,"Hi there,

Not sure where to start and if im at the right adress but here goes. Female 24, abusive youth due to a manipulative, alcoholic and aggressive father resulting in an addiction to self harm fairly young. Been to a psychologist when I was 16 for the first time due to excessive stress and high self demands which resulted in being constipated for two weeks. Did personal sessions and group sessions to keep my own 'critics voice' in my head under control.

Almost finished high school, parents commence in a horrible divorce. Mom and me leave, I go to university college somewhere far from home. First year of my new studies I had severe post traumatic stress syndrome and horrific night terrors which made me scared to go to sleep. Had a minor depression that year.

Spring last year, mayor depression hit me after graduating and having no idea what to do with my life. Not immediately finding work and feeling lost, I wander down and really consider just ending my life and be done with it. I e-mail my psychologist from when I was 16 and go back to see him. There he suggests taking antidepressant, I refuse since I want to try crawling out of the darkness myself first. I also didnt think I needed such drastic measurements as medication. But he did ask me if I knew anything about Highly Sensitive People because he thinks I fit in in that category. I meet someone new, finally figures out why I have always felt 'different', move out and live together with a college/friend and life seems bright for the first time in years.

Tho, real life is fucking hard. I have been a gamer during the crucial years of my social development. Also due to the abusive nature of my youth, I never really feel like I fit in anywhere. I work now, enjoying the things I should've enjoyed when I was younger - Partying, going out, festivals, having friends around. Problem: social interaction. Conclusion; I suck. Which causes a whole ton of problems and awkward situations for me and/or my boyfriend.

Now recently I have been feeling very detached from myself and my emotions. A bit too much has been going on lately, discussions with my boyfriend, drama between my friends, stress at work etc. It feels like a gigantic thick wall is placed between my body on the surface and my heart. In discussions, I stay extremely calm in contradiction to the normally very emotional person. I don't know if I care about anything right now, which scares me to crap. The best way to describe is that I feel my emotions but very far away, numbed by the thick wall you could say. Anyone who knows how to reverse this whole process? I've read some stuff about emotional detachment due to stress but I am not familiar with the term.

Sorry for the wall of text.. Any help is much appreciated.

Edit: Why did this become an announcement? :/

41,"Not sure if this is appropriate for this sub. But I have taken sleeping pills for around 12 years. I have been on Mirtazapine (15mg) for the last 9 years. Up until, maybe, 2 years ago I realized I don't dream anymore. If I take a nap I usually do, but at night after taking them I either 1) can't remember the dream or 2) just simply don't have them.

46,"Over the past few days a new idea has formulated in my mind. This summer has been a heap of shit, loneliness and laying in bed. The world is too noisy, I want an escape from it all. Away from everyone and everything. Especially my family. I feel as if my life is at a stand still, going nowhere and feeling nothing but pain.

So here it is, my idea.

I want to be a wanderer. I want to pack my bag and walk and keep walking. Follow the rivers and see all the things there is to see. Leave all my life behind and start fresh. The only person to care about being me. I'm not sure how long I'd wander for. Maybe till I die or till I'm done and want to return home who knows. 

What I need is some advice. What to pack? What to tell my family and friends? How to not have the police on my back? How to survive out there. 

The only person I've told seems to think I'm not very serious about this. But I am. Because I feel the only other escape is death and I don't want that. But I'm getting closer than ever.

Is there a better place I can post this where people who know more about this can help? ",17Aug2017,2

48,"Went through very bad phase in life, now I feel nothing towards people. I can't trust anyone, and I don't feel very much for anyone, even my girlfriend, and my childhood best friend. I've tried to just ""feel"" but I don't even know where to start. A few nights ago, I smoked a little bit of weed, and listened to a song that I was into months ago, when I felt greatly depressed, and sad. It was very weird for me because I began to feel the depression I used to have. I was covered in the overwhelming sadness that I used to deal with on a normal day. I told my self that I was okay, and then I felt uncomfortably warm, now when I listen to that song, I don't get those feels. I am trying my best to start feeling again, I get really subtle bursts and whispers of emotions, but they go away almost instantly. I am aware of the negative emotions that I will have to deal with, and I've encountered small ones so far. Unfortunately I don't really feel like I am making any progress.

50,A little background I have a buddy who I've known since high school am 30 now and I just got a random missed call from him so I decided to call him back. I have been recently seeing his instagram post and they have become increasingly strange and semi violent with him showing off knives and such. He has always struggled with mental health especially the past 5 years he's been in and out of homelessness and rehab etc. Well while on the call he begins ranting about how his parents are in the CIA and FBI and have been drugging him his whole life....which actually wouldn't be wrong as he's been on numerous anti depressants and was on ridilin for most of high school. When I told him his parents were not in fact CIA and FBI he flipped his shit and told me to fuck off in hind sight i shouldn't have been argumentative as he's clearly not in the right frame of mind to discuss something rationally. What should I do? I'm really worried about his current mental state and have seen him go through these manic episodes but this time he's clearly on the edge. Please someone educate me as to what the best course of action would be? ,17Aug2017,1

52,"My girlfriend of several years has depression. She's been on serotonin medication for as long as I've known her, and they've helped out. The issues she seems to be struggling with most recently (past year or so, since her mother died), is coming to grips with all of the abuse she endured as a child, and helping dispel or work around the irrational imprinting that still causes her duress to this day. 

We've spoken about getting professional help before, and she's always been receptive. I've left the process mostly in her hands, as I've tried to do with most things relating to her condition. The reason being that I didn't want to make it seem like I was forcing the decision on her, and that if she went, it would be because it was her choice. 

Well, the other night she finally broke down and told me that she finds the whole process of FINDING help a million times more overwhelming than the process of accepting help. She asked me if I could find a professional and get her on whatever track she needs to be on.

I can say now that, regardless of what your mental health is like, the searching process is overwhelming. It seems like all of the articles and helpful advice on line go over how to get to the point of accepting help, but they're mostly mute on how to find it.

What are the steps, once you've decided to get help, to actually finding the help you need?

55,"Hello all. I am a 26 yr old law student and obviously i can be very logical and analytical. The problem is i can't seem to turn that part of my brain off. It was not always this way, but now I really struggle with being spontaneous, funny, emotional, and a number of other things in conversation and in life. I'm really struggling socially b/c of it this. Part of it is i don't really understand people, or conversation for that matter. There is something going on on in conversation, that i just don't understand. It is incredibly frustrating to me, i feel so boring, and I really struggle with getting people interested in me, or to like me for that matter. People have conversations and they let their emotions guide them, they laugh, and bond; but i   almost can't do any of it. I almost don't think anything is funny anymore, and I really struggle with relating to people b/c of this. I treat conversation as if it is just an informational exchange, when i know that people are really having a more emotion driven exchange, and i have trouble getting into the latter. I understand that if you use a part of your brain more, that part will grow, while the other part will shrink. So. i think i need to use the emotional part of my brain more to grow, but i don't know how to engage that part of my brain. Does anyone have any ideas, advice, or methods for tapping into the emotional side of one's brain so as to overcome this? I would really appreciate so help. Give me anything you got! Thanks.
