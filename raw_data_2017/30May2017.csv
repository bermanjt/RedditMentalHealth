5,"I'm starting a weekly blog about living with my bipolar disorder and improving my life. I would like some input on what everyone here would like to see in it, currently I'm planning on two articles a week about taking points of mental illness ""Talking Points"" and what's going on in my life ""Week by Week"" and I might start another article where I get a medical professional to be interviewed or possibly even write an article each week too.
Please give me any and all input

6,"This is not so much a life problem but I just want to figure out what I'm dealing with. I like to play video games and the example I'd like to give involves me making a mistake in my game. For example, if my teammates tells me to do something like cast a spell, move somewhere, or just to stop doing something it somehow increases my chances of me making a mistake or doing the opposite. The best analogy I can make is like target fixation, where if you are driving on the road and you focus on something you will end up driving towards it as opposed to away from it, or like if you think about breathing or chewing as opposed to doing it subconsciously you kinda screw it up. Does this exist in some people? Do you have any sources you could link me or what is it called? I'm trying to help myself and a couple other people understand what I'm dealing with.",30May2017,1

8,"I've been fighting my anxiety and depression for about 5 years now. I was doing better for a while but recently have been feeling suicidal again and have started cutting again. Right now it's a good night, but those are becoming fewer and further between. I tried seeing a therapist a while back and honestly I wasn't comfortable with it. Maybe it was just that she and I didn't mesh, I don't know. I was on anti depressants for a while as well but the side effects were as bad as the depression. I tried getting help and finding a new doctor a few months ago but it took them 3 weeks to even call me back to get the rest of my information, and another 2 weeks before they would call me back to schedule anything. I don't know what other steps to take. I know I need help but I don't know how to get it. My original doctor is retired and in another state. Waiting so long to hear back when I tried to find a new one just took all the motivation away and added to all the negative feelings of not mattering when they couldn't return a phone call for weeks, not what you want when trying to find help. Any advice or suggestions on what to do? I'm so afraid of the road I'm on, but I don't know what to do. ",30May2017,2

11,"so the basis of it is, I've been isolating myself, I can't feel like I can hang out with people and not lose a lot of energy, I haven't had much genuine interaction and yet I want so much love and affection, so much so that when I try and make plans to hang out with friends when they bail on me I'll spend the entire day feeling grief on it, particularly mostly sadness n hopeless and anger and I,,,, don't know.

12,"For the past 5 years I've begun to feel something change in me. Something in my head really. I've been having medical problems between my heart and my brain and ever since then I've noticed a massive change in my personality. One being that I almost seem to have three other personalities who I can almost hear speak to me.

Honestly, it's super hard to explain because I feel like I'm making it up sometimes so I don't want to go around telling people this because they'll either think I'm just stupid or crazy and maybe I am. I don't know, but I've wanted to talk about it with someone who might feel the same or know what's going on.

More info: The 3 ""personalities"" are very distinct and consistent. We'll just call them Jeff, Adam and George. I normally just refer to them as my 3 sides of myself that take control sometimes but names will be easier for the sake of things.

Jeff is the first side I encountered during these changes. He's cold, completely isolated and very analytical. He doesn't like to talk or have any emotion or even deal with emotion. Simply is neutral towards everything and avoids all confrontation. But he loves to study people, figure out every single last thing about them. Which is weird to me because I've always hated trying to get to know someone but with him as part of me, when he takes over I find joy in figuring out someones deepest and darkest weaknesses and knowing what makes them want to live and what doesn't. It's creepy and weird I know but please hang in there.

Adam is cruel and when I say cruel I mean manipulative, evil, and just an all out dick. He wants to hurt people, actively destroy them and not physically. He wants them to cry, to relive traumatic, life ruining events that remind people that the past can hurt. No insult is too far and he tends to be the loudest of the three and therefore sometimes takes control more often.

The last one is George, who is simply a sweet guy. He loves everything and just wants to be liked. He'll do anything to try and make people happy along with himself. He is complete pacifist and wouldn't ever try to hurt someones feelings.

Now these three, I find hard to describe what they really are. While there are times they straight up take over and I become a practically different person which seems to be out of my control, for the most part they are just inside my head. I can hear their input on every single decision or thought I have. Down to simply deciding if I want to tell my coworker someone just called the phone. Adam and Jeff tend to be louder than George at nearly all times and my actual opinion tends to be completely different from all three but I actually find it tough not to choose one of their choices almost because I believe they're right.

Now as for the actual physical health issues I suffer. I have periods of time that have been on and off for years which seem to have no connection to anything, not even stress, where I tend to receive constant migraines, black out, become scatter brained. My black outs go as such: It starts with my eyesight slowly dimming as if fading out of a bugs bunny cartoon, then I begin to go numb and lose control of my body starting from the head and down to my legs. First arms, then hands, then legs. I can't really feel them, its almost like they've just all fallen asleep and I can't see and as far as actually thought process going on. I seem conscious but almost like I'm fighting a dream and trying to wake up. It's super scary and last from seconds to minutes. Sometimes I fall other times I have enough control to stay standing. I've been to the doctors for multiple test but nothing so far and its been a couple years. My dad suffered MS which they said might have explained why he abused my mother and I because it fucked with his personality and eventually killed him. But they said I'm young enough to where it might not show because it's too early. I'm 20 now, so please guys give me advice and thoughts. All 4 of us are listening.",31May2017,6
13,"I know I have chronic anxiety, chronic depression and bipolar II. Although my social worker who brings me to my appointments forgot the bipolar part. When I confronted her I got asked ""what difference would it make"". 

She still hasn't called me back after 2 days so I can make an appointment to see my psychologist and bring my family in so they can express the direness of the need for a change of medication. Or a reassessment of my diagnosis and to put actual premise on helping the bipolar I either have or do not have. 

I don't trust my doctor. I don't like my doctor. And most importantly she doesn't trust me. I've talked about switching doctors and I get told. ""Well this doctor is the best you won't find anyone else better"". 

The fighting me on this is all because I asked for them to write me an official list of my diagnosis so I can bring it to a medical marijuana clinic. They think I want weed. I gave up on that idea months when I realized nobody was going to help me. 

I explained how my mother wants to come in and tell them about how my moods are all over the place and unstable. How the medication I'm on is doing absolutely nothing. 

When I said the other night I laid in bed for 6 hours crying and thinking about suicide... She asked me ""Well, do you feel better today?"". This is the social worker who connects me directly to my psychologist. She works for a company that specifically outsources for mental health and is paid for by the government. 

Is it me? Am I just ""Not hearing what I want to hear"" which is what I was told? I'm so confused. I feel helpless. I just want to stop hurting inside. 


Edit: Psychologist/psychiatrist the one who monitors my medication and sees me every 3 months. 
 

Another edit in case it's asked. I'm on a healthy cocktail of Cipralex Wellbutrin and clonazepam.

23,"I've been with my girlfriend for roughly 2.5 years. When we first met she suffered from anxiety. It was mildly bad and she was medicated for it with Beta blockers.

Over time her mental health has deteriorated massively. I have tried incredibly to help her with everything, encouraging, supporting and solving issues right across the board. I grew up with a manic depressive parent and have decent understanding and awareness of mental health, so I've always felt like I could take it in my stride.

Three months ago she started self-harming. When that happened I encouraged her to find a therapist and she did. 

10 days ago she overdosed on co-codamol, consuming 10grams of paracetamol in the process. She spent four days in hospital, attempted to discharge herself on the third day. The whole period through that has ruined me.

She claims if was an accident and that she wanted to fall asleep. She thought the codeine portion would do that and didn't realise paracetamol was dangerous.

I've been able to deal with almost everything she's thrown at me but this feels like one too far. She's smart, clever and good at understanding people. I feel like our trust has been ripped up and I have no energy left for anything, that our relationship is dead.

Her behaviour is incredibly reminiscent of Bordeline Personality Disorder. She swings moods, tells me off for things that don't matter and pushes people away constantly. She constantly changes between bring the nicest, sweetest person alive and someone completely different. 

She wants constant attention. Only last night she sat in her car for four hours outside her work. This happened after I said I wanted to see my friends for the evening. She becomes emotionally hysterical, saying she constantly feels like I don't care. No matter how often I jump her bar, she moves it higher.

I feel lied to, emotionally blackmailed and pulled apart. I don't know if these feelings are valid, 

Now I'm at breaking point. I lost what was good about our relationship and I'm so bloody sad. I cried for 15 minutes last night. Its the first time I cried in six years. As a person who starts each days happy, like a 25 year old male Cinderella metaphor, it's completely shit.

We've lost all the fun. She won't do anything like we used to and have a terrible relationship. 

I'm also terrified of breaking up with her. She has one close friend who she won't talk to about problems, two parents who lack understanding and communication and no one else. She uses me as a crutch for everything and is genuinely suicidal on a daily basis.

29,"Hello. 
There is some info I have found and would like to discuss it with you guys.
Vitamin D3 is necessary to absorb calcium, but calcium absorbed from food first gets to the soft tissues- veins, arteries, organs. 
Vitamin K1 is responsible for blood thicking.
Vitamin K2 allows calcium to move where it should be moved- inside bones and teeth.
If someone is taking blood thinning medicines (the ones that are on my mind- turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, ginkgo biloba) they will act totally opposite to vitamin K1 and will block it's action. So if it's blood thicking action is blocked- even less of it can be converted into K2 form (I found info that gut flora isn't the only mechanism by which our body converts K1 into K2) 
 
I realised that drinking green tea (caffeine blocks calcium's absorption, and acts as a diuretic- so it causes more calcium to be excreted with urine) and eating lots of spices (which act as a blood thinners- totally opposite to the vitamin K1+probably affecting negatively gut flora) affected negatively my teeth so I'm probably sufficient in calcium...  

So if I'll add vitamin K2 into my regimen which contains few blood thinners will I be able to somehow direct calcium inside my bones?
Will it be safe to use vitamin K2 (MK7 form/ to put calcium inside bones and teeth)+ Vitamin D3 (to get sufficient blood levels of it, so I can absorb calcium) + calcium+ blood thinners all together?

It's my first post there. So ... I'll start from the bottom :) But... Hello guys and I'd truly appreciate to discuss with you!",31May2017,1

33,"This is a very long post, but I feel like I need to explain it thouroughly in order for anyone to get the full picture, so...

I’ve been with my now ex-bf for about 8 years. We’ve know each other for 10 and been best friends.
About 7 months ago, in October, he left the country for almost a year, to do research in a poor west African country. 
I had been having some serious personal struggles for a while, and with the prospect of him leaving for an entire year, I suggested we take a break and think about what is really important for us – but also letting him know that I still loved him like no other and still could see a future depending on what happened during that year. 
This was hard. But we made it work and were still friends. For about two months… Then one night, the compound he lived at was ambushed and he was held gunpoint and robbed by a mass of locals threatening him with machetes and weapons. They left with his belongings and knocked him down. 
This was of course very traumatic. And we (his family/friends and I) did everything we could to help him. 
He went home a couple of days after. Got a therapy session. I stopped everything, took time of work/studies and spent all the time with him that he wanted, and just tried my best at supporting him and letting him know how much he meant to me and everyone. 
He, against many people’s advice, then suddenly decided that he wanted to go back to Africa after less than 2 weeks back home. He felt that if he didn’t do it then, he would never go back. 
We also agreed that only 2 weeks after he went back down there, I would come visit him for 3-4 weeks. He was very keen on this as he felt otherwise he wouldn’t be able to pull through. So I did. 
I spent the most of January down there with him, and we got very close. Relationship wise. Because something was off even then. He got easily frustrated, drank a lot, couldn’t sleep at night, didn’t want to be places with many people. And he was extremely protective of me. He needed to know where I was at all times or he would panic. I tried talking with him about how he felt but very quickly he would shut down. 
I left there with a feeling of him not being fine, but he desperately wanted to stay. He didn’t want to give up. I convinced him of the need to keep getting therapy, and he agreed to that. 
I also did something that I now feel was a bad decision. I wanted to take it slow and still consider our lives. Seeing how he was doing after the assault I felt maybe he wasn’t completely there emotionally, and I didn’t want to make that big of a life decision, with him being “out of it”.
When I left, he told me he loved me and that he wanted to get back together because he felt we were soulmates. That he could never love anyone more than me and I was the most important person in his life. 
We agreed upon giving it a chance when he would get home in August, and we would start thinking about maybe moving in together as well. But still doing some reflection as we were both in difficult times in our life.

This is when things started getting weird. 
2 weeks passed and he was having a very hard time. He didn’t do well at all. At the same time I was getting worse as well. Then suddenly he got distant. Not answering me and when he finally did he was angry or frustrated. Then, on the very same day that I got diagnosed with depression – actually when I told him about it – he told me that he didn’t love me anymore and didn’t want to be with me at all. He wasn’t sad, angry or anything. He had no expression of emotion what so ever. 
This just pushed me further down. I was mad and sad at the same time. I couldn’t believe he could do this at that exact time, when he knew exactly what I was going through. He said he would still like us to talk because he felt bad for me. I felt like a pity case.
Some time passed and we finally decided not to speak for a while, because everytime we did, he would be very distant and it made me even more sad. All along I tried talking to him about how he was doing since the whole assault thing, but he refused.
In start May he came home for about 2 weeks. This had been planned ever since he left the first time. About 2 days before he was to be back he contacted me. We talked and decided we still wanted to be friends – it’s hard giving up 8 years of close friendship just like that. 
So, when he got back he lived in my apartment – sleeping in a different room. 
The very moment he stepped into the apartment he started crying. He felt so bad being home. He didn’t want to be here, he wanted to be back in Africa. He didn’t like being back because he wasn’t “special” like he was in Africa. I thought this was a very strange thing to say but kept it for myself. 
He stayed in my apartment for 1,5 weeks. He spent the most of his time working on his project at the local hospital with his supervisor whom he also lives with, most of the time in Africa. 
He saw other people very limited. One friend, whom he had spent 2 months in Africa with on the project, and then 1 party with some other of his friends. 
He only saw his parents 1 or 2 times. 
We went to our best friend’s wedding and turns out he didn’t prepare for this at all. Didn’t have a suit, didn’t have a present, no speech, nothing. He hadn’t given it a single thought. 
I felt like he was a stranger. And when I confronted him with this, he got mad.
I found it strange that he didn’t want to spend more time with the people he hadn’t seen for so long. And that he had planned to go to the capital in our country and spend 3 out of 13 days there, just to see people he knew from the Africa project. People he had only known for somewhere between 2 weeks and 2 months, and whom he had just lived with and was going to see again within a very short time, because they were also going back to Africa again. 
He got mad and said that they were his friends; that they understood him in a way others couldn’t. They knew “what Africa did to you”. Again, he also refused to talk to me about how he was coping after the assault, and said he didn’t talk to anyone about that.
1 hour before he was to leave for the capital he then told me he was seeing someone else. That he had met her in February, and now he was in love with her. 
I was very shocked and mad that he hadn’t told me anything about this before. Especially since I had asked him directly about this a couple of times. 
The minute he arrived in the other city all contact with him seized – until he was in Africa again 3 days later. 

I have now learned that he went to the capital and lived with her. He didn’t see anyone else while he was there either. 
I’ve tried getting some explanation from him on what has happened this spring. He just dismisses it.
It’s been 2 weeks now since he left. In this time he has done nothing but lie to me – everytime I ask him about something he makes up a new explanation. 
We’ve only communicated through email. 
Finally, he’s admitted now that he doesn’t recognize himself anymore. That he’s a different person. Sometimes he feels like he is out of his body and it’s a different person doing the things he’s doing. 
But at the same time he also feels like this is his life now. Africa. And that for the first time in his life he’s doing what is right for him.
I honestly don’t know what to think anymore. I don’t know if he has some sort of PTSD, if he’s just “snapped”, or if this is truly just who he is. 
I feel very weird about the whole project down there as well. 
He’s admitted that he thinks at least 3 of the people running the place are sociopaths. 
Amongst them it is widely accepted that you sleep with someone in order to get what you want. It’s accepted to cheat with budgets to get funding. Buying local prostitutes is just fine, and generally they look at themselves as ”white kings”. All of this is something the person I’ve known for the last 8 years could NEVER accept or engage in, but now… He is a complete stranger. 

He keeps saying that I still mean a lot to him and he hopes we can be friends. 
I don’t feel like I can do that after the way he’s treated me for the past 4 months. But I’m unsure if I should?
I’ve doubted my own intentions in this. After all, I am now the ex-girlfriend who got dumped for another. I don’t want to seem jealous or pitiful. But I am generally worried about what is happening. 
None of the leaders down there took care of anything when he was assaulted. And no one is taking care of anything now. As far as they are concerned he is doing just fine, and everything is well. 
He’s already committed to running a new project as well, meaning he has to go down there everytime he has a vacation etc., for the next couple of years. They are trying to convince him to take on a PhD project as well, meaning he should live there for at least 2 more years. And no one thinks he should get any help. 
From what I heard when I was down there they make a great deal of telling the students that they are special because they live there. That no one will understand them when they go home, and that it will be very hard and tiring once they move back home. This may be far stretched, but the thought of something in the lines of brainwashing did cross my mind a couple of times…
I feel the goal of the people involved in the project is to get even more included. When I was there they even tried to convince me to take a research year, so we could be a project-couple and dedicate our time to them. I refused, having that very bad feeling about something not being right. About the unhealthy attitude amongst them all.

So, I’ve questioned my interpretation of this for the last couple of weeks. Maybe it is just me? 
Maybe I am just jealous and should leave him be – living his life and being happy. 
No one in his family has mentioned anything. They’ve just been completely silent ever since we broke up. 
But then, yesterday, one of his good friends contacted me. 
He was worried. About me, and about my ex. 
He told me that their group of friends, who had all been to that party when he was home, were all extremely concerned. That he had acted somewhat crazy. Saying the same things; that he didn’t want to be in our country anymore. 
He had said, and I quote “Being in Africa is like being on heroin” and “he didn’t know what had happened, but suddenly from one day to the next, he went from hating the place to feeling like he could live his entire life down there and be happy”.
I also learned he had told them about this new girl he had slept with. Apparently they had a right to know before I did….
Generally they were all concerned. No one felt like they knew him anymore. That he had changed and it was scary. He also told me that the contact they’d had with him since he was last home was very, very limited. He didn’t speak to any of them anymore. And when confronted with this he had just bragged about how hadn’t spoken to his mom in 6 months either. 
Of the very limited contact they had had with him, it was when he had generously told them all about this article a local newspaper back home had written about him because he got a funding from UNICEF. This was just prior to his return, and I happen to know as one of the only ones, that it was actually himself and his supervisor who had contacted different newspapers to see if they could get anyone to write about his accomplishments. While he was back and we were at these weddings and stuff, this was about the only thing that would make him happy – when people commented on the article and his accomplishments. His eyes would become wild and he would smile like never before. 
Apparently this was something his friends had picked up on as well. How weird it was that he kept promoting himself in that way. And acting like everything was fine, that his life was great and he was so so happy, when they all felt something was off. 

His friend is contemplating about whether we should do something - and if so, what?
I’m unsure. On one hand I’m thinking something about him is completely off and want to help him. On the other hand I feel like he’s treated me so shitty for such a long time, that I shouldn’t be bothered with it anymore. That it’s not my responsibility. 
I’m also unsure what is actually wrong with him. Could this be pure PTSD or is it something else?
I worry that if I do try to help with anything and speak up about it to anyone other than his friend, I will come off as a jealous and crazy ex-girlfriend. 
Admittedly I am very hurt, and no, I don’t like the thought about this new girl. I am biased in this situation. But still..
Do you have any ideas/advice? 
Do you think maybe him getting home in August, being away from all the Africa craziness, will somehow make a difference? 
We’re all worried that he will not return – and that if he does he will immediately go back. 
I also happen to know that this new girl is a very prominent feature in the project. I am worried her influence will be in the direction of just cutting everyone else out of his life and moving down there permanently. As he’s already demonstrating the tendencies towards. 
No one except Africa people has any meaning in his life anymore. He simply doesn’t care. 

Should I just leave him be, and accept that he’s, apparently, finally happy?
Should I keep contact with him or just cut him off?
Do you think there is actually something wrong or is it just one of these things that happen? That people change…",31May2017,4

36,"I say envy because it's the closest way I can describe this. I have also posted this in /r/anxiety and /r/teenrelationships previously with little to no response, and I'm getting quite desperate here.

So last July my GF I started going out. We'd been best friends for a while beforehand though. This is not only my first relationship but also the first person I've ever had romantic feelings for but I can honestly say that we are really perfect for each other. Problem is, I often get ""envy"" where if she has something or is something, I will want to have that or be that. There isn't as much a thought as is a feeling, and honestly I would describe it as similar to sensory overload (which I get too). I can't concentrate on anything, I won't laugh at something I would laugh at or anything like that, the only thing going through my head is the ""envy"". It can be based on different things like the fact that she got a new piano or that she's going to Canada (I have plenty more examples that I can give if you need more description or whatever).

If I were to try and pinpoint the cause the only thing I could think of would be self-esteem problems which are probably due to the fact that I spent 75% of my childhood standing around on my own.

It should be noted as well that it's happened about other people before, but not as strong and never more than once so far. And a friend of mine has told me he has something quite similar though he doesn't know anything either.

Please, I'm really grasping for anything here, even just a name of a mental illness or one that it *could* be even. This is threatening to ruin my relationship and I really don't want that. I apologise if this is very vague as well, it's very difficult to describe.",31May2017,1
37,"I'm not one to diagnose myself and this is actually the first time I have ever posted anything personally on the internet despite having been using it for years. I’ve actually never discussed this sort of thing to anyone ever, but I feel compelled to get someone else’s opinion while I am anonymous. I heard about SPD recently and it peaked my interest as many of the symptoms seem to match my personality. But my family has a history of bi-polar depression and schizophrenia on my mom’s side, so it might be something else. 

I am in my mid-twenties and am female. I haven’t had friends since elementary school. Not because s I was bullied but I always found myself going off and eating my lunch behind the classroom buildings or in parking lots my parents never knew that and I’m sure they would have tried to get me to be sociable, which is probably why I never told them. They thought I had friends but that I just didn’t like sleepovers and stuff. I'm a bit of a nerd so I mostly just devoted myself to schoolwork and my own hobbies. I went college with my brother (who suffers from bi-polar depression) and we shared a small flat while we studied. I love my brother and my family (to an isolatory degree, they were my only friends) but from what I can recall, I have never had an intimate conversation with any of them. The living situation ended up being very bad for the both of us as he flunked out and was going through a lot of emotional stuff that I simply could not understand or reciprocate in any helpful way. I don't do well in understanding other's emotions or properly articulating mine in a way that would help others. I just again retreated into my own-self and finished school before moving universities with my brother. Now it's been a couple more years of university (I am studying bioinformatics) and I have found myself becoming more and more isolated. I found a way to spend most of my time off campus and working for my degree on my computer. I find that most of what I think about is finding ways to limit my time speaking to others. I HATE “chitchat” and never feel any interest in people I don’t know. In every social situation or gathering I have ever been in, I can only just think about wanting to leave. I feel like I do well with people I know acting interested and even being funny, but all I can think about is wanting to leave and be alone. When I act like I naturally feel like, people seem to think of me as depressed, indifferent and even “uppity”. Finally getting away from people is a huge relief to me that I think is probably not normal and not good.

 However for money, I spent some time working between semesters stocking groceries at night but I dreaded speaking with co-workers and the occasional customer. It got to the point where my boss asked me to work the register. I tried to last a week, but I had to quit after a few days. I hated trying to figure out what the normal way to greet someone is, what amount of ""chitchat"" was required, how to answer someone’s joke or comment. It did not interest me at all and it even gave me fear and dread that people would be looking at me an expecting something from me. I did not sleep at night because I KNEW that I would have to go and try to act like a sociable person the next day. This is just the reason why I have yet to talk to a professional. 

I’ve been on a downward trajectory since high school and do not feel any interest for the future or even the next day. I have trouble imaging myself in the future. I can’t conjure up a picture like I feel most others can to some degree. I am very messy and disheveled and do not care about my looks as much as I did in the past. I despise people touching me, even my own family, especially my face and head. I feel very little interest in any hobby where it requires more than, say, a couple hours where I used to have things I would devote myself to. It’s really affecting me now at the end stages of my degree in that it is hard for me to care about my work. I often find myself distracted from my work with circular thoughts and laying under the covers with the curtains drawn think similar things over and over to the point where it is sometimes scary. I really struggle with insomnia which is my prime motivation to go see a doctor. I have been having trouble for a while now finding myself something that brings me joy, I have found myself compulsively looking for something to interest me. I used to compose music, and I still get the random drive to write something but I will just sit and think about it without doing it. I don’t really mean depressed, but I have contemplated suicide numerous times and it is something I think about every time my head hits my pillow. If I did it, it would be more out of frustration than despair. I don’t drink alcohol until I hit points where I will drink to near lethal levels and then swear off it until next time. Whenever I do leave my current house and go to campus, I pass by an electrical station that has high voltage power cables and I eat lunch next to it every time. I probably won’t touch it but I can’t help thinking about it at night. 

So I am contemplating calling/emailing my GP and getting an appointment to see someone mostly about the insomnia, but I keep choosing to stay in my room than going. Something needs to change because I need to get and keep a job. I can’t tell if I really need to and if it’s just my normal introverted personality from growing up with no friends, or if it may be a real neurochemical problem that can be helped. I am already getting bored of writing this post, so many thanks to anyone that can give advice.",31May2017,2

Could someone please give me advice? 21 year old male,
I've always lived with depression on top of many other things, I believe. I've never been to a professional for help.
Lately it's been getting a lot worse; my head is loud, I havent eaten for about a week, I wake up in panic attacks so I cant really sleep much.
One person I've always confided in was my long term girlfriend, but she left me not too long ago and I'm sure that's something that triggered a lot of this because now I'm alone. But this isnt /r/relationshipadvice so I wont go too far into that.
I'm going back and forth between pacing back and forth and cleaning my apartment because if someone were to come here if I break I wouldnt want them to see how much of a mess it is.
I actually reached out to my mother, which I have NEVER done (again, never seeked help, Im a very closed-in person), and thats a sign to me that its serious.
I called off work, I know theyre going to fire me.
I feel like I may need to admit myself but Im scared. I feel like i should drink, but im scared. I'm terrified of myself and breaking down, I need direction. I thought I was stronger than this, but I need direction. Please help.",31May2017,1

42,"Hi, I need some advice on dealing with family member with some mental health issues.

My uncle (in his late 40s) is dealing with depression and anxiety and my grandfather (his dad) and myself don't know how to exactly help him. My grandmother (his mom) yells at him for complaining and doesn't see why he has these issues even after countless hours of me explaining to her that he needs our endless support. We are the only part of the family that he has reached out to and he doesn't really want anyone else involved (family wise). 

He has a therapist that he goes to a couple of times of week, but my grandfather and I don't think its enough. We have tried to convince him to go to his doctor to get a referral for a psychologist but he says he doesn't have the energy to go. He also tells us he is having trouble falling asleep at night as well. 

He lives alone, and my grandfather and I are visiting for the week but we are afraid to leave him alone. My grandfather lives in a different state and I am an undergraduate taking summer classes. I will try to visit him as often as I can but I don't have a car to get to his house nor do I have the money to pay for an Uber so I won't be able to see him as often as I could.

44,"SEXTING:
When I was 17 I sexted two girls over snapchat, one was 13, the other was 14, and both girls were extremely developed and flirty. They were friends, knew me on Instagram and I added them on snapchat. One thing led to another, hormones were going crazy and I just couldn't resist. I feel utter guilt now and it has only been recently that the guilt hit me in a wave of depression (I'm 18 now) and since then I've felt shame for what I did. I never saw them completely naked or anything like that, but I did try to get them to do it but thankfully they did not.
We all decided to stop when we realised it got weird and in good humour we said to pretend it never happened. I feel evil. Malevolent. I honestly hope that I did not damage them psychologically, I even prayed for them! (I'm not religious!) I'm losing my mind. And all this has been happening while I further become insecure about myself. 

PORN
A few months ago (while still being 18) I consciously typed in ""jailbait"" porn on pornhub's search engine and I shocked myself with what came up. I, with utter shame admit this, was looking for a girl who was around 16 (in the UK it is legal to have sex with a 16 year old) because I find girls around that age attractive, I also find 18 year olds attractive, and 40 year olds too, but there's a taboo around 16 year olds and I don't know what it is that compelled me to do so. Well, I found a video and there was no face but just the backend of a girl who looked fairly developed, she tweaked and fingered herself slightly. I masturbated and afterward looked back over the video and thought ""no way is she 18, or even 16"" so I reported the video multiple times for being underage and it is still there! No word, I told them to email me if it was and so far they haven't. I just feel so fucking ashamed of myself. Sometimes I think suicide would be the answer. I remember my mum once said once, ""the moment someone starts having those thoughts (she was referring to paedophiles on one of those US to catch a predator shows) they should kill themselves."" I took this to heart and now I feel like one of them, a peadophile, and I am at the lowest depths of pain and confusion. What do I do? Is what I did normal? Is any of this normal behaviour at all for an 18 year old virgin? I don't know anymore, I think I am irredeemable. 

EDIT: I suppose what scares me and makes me ashamed most is that if, for example, that 13 year old was in the same room as me and we were alone and she wanted to have sex, I don't think I'm strong enough to say no.",31May2017,7
45,"I've had social anxiety (undiagnosed) for as long as I can remember but I've never had anything I would consider a panic attack until recently. I've started having these weird episodes, usually it will start where something triggers some sort of memory either from a dream or some sort of deja vu. I then feel really weirdly out of it for between half an hour to an hour like I'm in a dream or I don't know what's real and what's not, if I try to do anything during this time I guess it seems like I'm really distracted because I do things wrong and forget things. This leads to panic attack symptoms where I feel sick, struggle to breathe properly and feel like I want to cry, I also start having some sort of extensial crisis where I just look at my life and my future and panic about it. I get really confused trying to work out things like what month it is and what I'm doing tomorrow. I stay like this for a while just being really confused and wondering what's real. When it starts wearing off I'm confused for a while by normal things, like I'll get a message from someone carrying on a conversation from earlier and I've almost forgotton I was talking to them and what about, I only remember when I read it back. I just generally feel really out of it. I've just come out of one now and I keep walking in to a room to do something and forgetting what it was, I feel like there's something I should be doing and I'm still stuck with some deja vu but it's like I can't even remember what it is I'm thinking of I just get these little flashes.

It might be worth mentioning that I've had insomnia my whole life, it kinda comes and goes but it's been really good lately. I also get sleep paralysis a few times a year but not for a while. I remember my dreams almost every night. 

I came home (to my parents house) from uni for the summer a few days ago and my dad came home early from work today, I think they might be contributing to me being confused.

47,"I've noticed that I kinda lack empathy. I live In the UK and there was a terrorist attack lately and while everyone else were crying and feeling bad. I just didn't feel anything no empathy, no sadness, just an empty feeling, felt detached In a way. I just didn't care. So I analysed myself and I noticed that I Manipulate/Deceive people for my own self interest without even realising It, everything I did was for an Ego boost/Confidence boost. I created a false self in a way, my personality would change depending on who I'm with and make everyone else around me like/relate to me I would analyse them and adapt towards them. All of this for an Ego boost. I have no real persona It changes on who I'm with. When my Ego becomes damaged and hurt I go into a downward spiral of depression until my Ego Is repaired. So what do you guys think, I'm not a bad person but it's scary knowing this. Thanks for any feedback guys.

48,"Writing this from a throwaway account for maximum anonymity. 

A little about me: 

I'm a 20 year old male from Europe (would rather not state country), currently questioning my very own existence, and on top that i'm dealing with loneliness. Had a normal upbringing, upper middle class. Though I have been bullied most of my school years (physical, verbal, cyber bullying, you name it). 

As the title indicate, I'm having an existential crisis, and it's getting bad. I feel like my life has no purpose. Right now i'm awaiting answer from a university that I applied to, I expect to be accepted. But even after graduating, what next? Working a 9-5 job for the rest of my life, while retaining the feeling of emptiness and meaningless. Just the thought of it makes me depressed. I'm undoubtedly at my lowest, and I feel like going insane to the point where I probably belong in a mental asylum. Every. Single. Day. 

Another thing. I've never had a girlfriend in my life, and while we're at it, I haven't had any friends since Elementary school. That just adds more fuel to the fire; Living a life with no meaning, and crushing loneliness. All alone with no one to talk with. It really fucks with my sanity, man. Reading books, watching anime, and watching Bob Ross painting videos are currently the only things that makes me not lose my mind. 

You might be asking, are you trying to do something about it? Yes. I'm trying to seek help from a therapist, but i'm currently lacking the funds. I'm trying to get a job so I afford therapy sessions, but in the meantime, this place is my best option for support and advice. 

So please, every piece of advice, help, support, cute cat gifs are appreciated. 

Thank you for reading, and I hope your day is going better than mine. 


EDIT: Thank you for all of your comments. I will be taking them all into consideration, and strive to overcome my personal issues. Your comments and cute cat gifs are (hopefully) going to help me, and maybe one day be able to personally thank you all for your help. ",31May2017,14

I think there was roughly six times today where killing myself seemed like an option. Six whole times I had to distract myself from these overwhelming, draining thoughts. I'm still here though, and I'll still be here tomorrow night, and he night after. 

I tried to call my closest friend to distract myself, laughters the best medicine and all that, but there was no answer, twice. So that was 2 of my 6 suicidal thoughts of the day. 

Can you imagine literally being sat at work concentrating then the next minute your daydreaming about various ways to end your life like it's normal? 

The reason I'm posting this here is none of the brilliant people around me can understand that. They struggle to understand the basics of depression and anxiety let alone the complex stuff. They'd assume I want to die and I don't. 

I have a great life, don't get me wrong it's not perfect but it's better than it has been and I wake up grateful every day. Just some days by lunchtime I forget the positives and there's always a negative to focus on.

I recently got a new one, so my psychologist doesn't know anything. Plus, I haven't told anyone everything yet. It is very long. Very. I'm talking about a lot of the major things that have happened in my life. I just want to get some help dealing with these issues. I just don't know if I'm capable of saying everything. Plus, I don't want to miss anything either. A letter seems like the safest way to go. However, can I just take it with me and ask my psychologist to read it as soon as I get in? It's very long, but I don't think I'm carpal of uttering these words. Although, maybe I could read the letter out loud. I'll have a script, so I know I won't miss anything. I'll probably cry a lot. But that shouldn't matter much to the psychologist.

I also have a bunch of emails that I've sent back and forth with someone. They have made a major impact on me. I want my psychologist to know everything. There are plenty of emails, and some of them are quite long.

I guess what I'm asking is this; how should I proceed? If anything, I can hand her the letter afterwards. Although I'd prefer that we talked about it during our first session. What about the emails though? I don't think it's realistic to ask her to read them during our session. They are quite long, and there are many. Plus, the letter is the most important.
