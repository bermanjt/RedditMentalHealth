0,"Hello, Im a 19 year old man from Canada and am in my second last year of college. The college that i attend is in my home city so im still living with my parents while i attend. At the start of this year i got my first part time job (little late i know) Ever since ive had horrible problems with spending money. Outside of normal food purchases anything i spend on i have extreme anxiety (sometimes panic attacks) about until i refund it. Now that its almost October i cant buy anything. Which is resulting in a boring Work/school lifestlye. I always have this thought when i try to buy something, ""Me in the future, homeless, thinking i could have used that money to prevent this"". It sounds so irrational but its crippling. Its gotten to the point where i cant sleep because i feel so guilty over the money that my parents must have spent raising me. 
I feel like i learnt the value of money too late, and now its destroying me,
Please offer some advice",28Sep2017,1
1,"Edit: I think my title got cut-off. It's supposed to finish with stigmatized work culture. 

I work in a really small-staffed kitchen full time. I'm wanting to see a therapist but most of them cut into my work time. To make things worse  my boss/job doesn't seem to take mental health seriously and I'm not on totally good terms with my boss. We're not enemies but not close. Two years ago another co-worker started taking leave for therapy. Management told people this and unbeknownst to her, she became known as the ""crazy"" girl in that place . Sometimes people in actual management made jokes/negative remarks about her mental state amongst themselves.

I don't know what to do. I need to tell them that I would like to leave work early once a week for this but I'm concerned that it may be used against me later if unrelated work concerns arise. Basically where things just silently get pinned on mental health by default and my fitness for the job and time reliability gets questioned(I don't know if  this would actually happen, just worried that it might based on work culture).

Has anyone been in this tye of situation? What's the best way you approached this issue? I don't have any  ideas other than telling them straight up and asking for a schedule change.

Thanks ",28Sep2017,1
2,"I can't think of any good qualities that I have, naturally or developed. I seem kind, but those who become close to me I always manage to infuriate and push away with my selfishness and self-entitlement. I seem confident, but inside I hold so many complexes and self hate. I seem responsible, but I constantly procrastinate to the point that it is pathetic. I can't even say that I'm relaxed or laid back, because the minute someone criticizes me, no matter how valid it is, I turn red-faced angry. 
I don't get it. I have to fight SO HARD in order for me to do anything that goes against my self-centered nature. I need help in so many areas in my life and I fight and piss off the people that try to help me or be kind to me. It seems what I do think of myself, is that I am a 19 year-old lazy college student who is self-conscious, selfish, and borderline abusive. 
I need answers as to where to start, because at this point, I don't think I'm worth a glance from anyone. ",28Sep2017,1

I'm currently on Prozac and it's been working fine for a month until recently when I had a palpitation which caused all my old symptoms to come back, panicking about heart related issues, chest pains, increased heart rate.

8,"So I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, but i think I have something else too. I don't know if posting on here will actually help but having somewhere to record it would be nice, because due to these problems, i have a hard time relaying it back to my therapist.

I act like someone I'm not, It's me but I'm lying about how I'm feeling or lying about what I think and acting like someone else but I don't even know I'm doing it. I say things just to make people happy and will genuinely believe what I'm saying, but I'll think back on it later and think ""Why the hell did I say that?""
I remember when I do it, clear as day, and I know it's me, but I'm always contradicting myself and changing myself and doing things just to get certain reactions and I don't even _know_ i'm doing it. It took someone telling me to finally figure it out.

And when my therapist asks me what's wrong, I don't know what to say, because I genuinely believe nothing. But so many things are wrong, so many things happen, all the time, yet for some reason for that specific hour I'll believe that I'm fine and forget everything I was meaning to tell her.

Feels like everything I do is to get a 'correct' response.

What is this? Is it normal? Is it just social anxiety? I do it even when I'm not anxious, it's something I don't even notice I'm doing. I'll be completely fine, not tense, not anxious, but I'll act completely like someone else and have all of that ""person's"" intentions and interests.

11,"So I have been suffering with depression since about the 7th grade (I'm a senior in hs right now) and have been in a constant downward spiral since the symptoms first manifested themselves. I have suicidal thoughts daily and need advice on who I can turn to. When I was in 8th grade I first told my parents about my suicidal thoughts and they stuck me in a mental hospital asap. Honestly I have no idea how anybody could recover in places like that, if anything, it made my feelings worse. I was discharged after 2 weeks and have played the part of the healthy kid since then. I usually suffer in silence but every so often I will have a pseudo-breakdown, sometimes from very mundane things. My only real outlets are writing in my journal and playing music. I can't sleep at night so my lack of sleep only makes everything worse. The only reason I haven't seen a doctor frequently about all of these problems is because my family is fairly poor and we can't afford raised premiums to insurance. Im paranoid, suffer from anxiety and depression, and although undiagnosed display bipolar tendencies.I suppose my real question is who can I turn to for advice in my relationships? I want to tell somebody, I really do, but as far as my family goes, I can't talk to my dad because honestly in more mature than him, I can't talk to my mom because I don't trust her because she acts first, thinks later.

This is something I've been debating a long while now. And by a long while, I mean several years. Friends of mine have been urging me all this time that I need therapy. Friends who have had therapy themselves and know the signs and symptoms of people who need help. After my years of stubbornness and denial, I finally felt like I reached a limit. I need help.

Unfortunately, I don't know where to go. And the friends who have had therapy do not live in the same area as me, so they aren't familiar with the resources around where I live. I live in the Houston, Texas area, so any suggestions for good therapists would be appreciated. I don't have any medical insurance in case that information is needed.",28Sep2017,2
13,"Ok i will try to make this quick.


I was seeing a therapist for about 2.5 years - from late 2013 to middle of 2016. I initially went because i was having some anxiety and issues with my boyfriend. While working with her a lot of stuff came up about my life and my family that I had never realized which obviously made me upset and exposed me to some emotions i had never had before. I stopped going because I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere with the therapy and it was just the same thing over and over so i thought taking a break would be good. There were a lot of times where I felt like the therapy made me feel worse. There were also times i felt a *tiny* bit like i couldn't totally talk openly with her.


Fast forward to present day - last week my boyfriend's younger brother died in a horrific car accident. He has been on an alcohol bender for the past 8 days. I have struggled with some of his drinking in the past. I am totally beside myself on what to do with this situation... I had dinner with my parents last night and opened up about his drinking (probably a bad idea as i would rather them not know about it), somehow the conversation took a turn for the worse - my mom started asking me all these questions about whether or not i'm happy with him, when we are going to get married, if i want kids or not, why i don't call her or visit her more often, and how she thinks i'm unhappy, etc, etc. A LOT of stuff came up that has been buried forever and a lot of stuff i had spoken to my therapist about. My mom also felt like the therapy was making me worse as well (which i guess makes sense since a lot of stuff about her came up during therapy).

So now i am at a loss and feel like i need someone to talk to - about how to help my boyfriend grieve the loss of his brother and how he is turning to alcohol to cope, and how to deal with my relationship with my mother since this stuff randomly came up out of nowhere.


So - Do i go back to my old therapist since she knows my history somewhat? or do i find a new one because i was feeling like therapy made me feel worse at times and didn't feel 100% comfortable with her?


also if anyone has any other suggestions or words of advice, i definitely need it right now, so please feel free to chime in.",28Sep2017,1

15,"My parents both are very critical people. I love them and we have a good relationship but they do criticize what seems like everything, I was raised around it. They are also the type of people to never admit fault or accept losing an argument. Before, my therapist gestured at the notion and asked if my parents were critical people but we brushed it off because I said no.

Now I think I am realizing how it is affecting me. I dwell on negatives in a situation, always needing an out if a situation doesn't go to plan. I'm terrified at furthering my career because I don't want to be stuck doing something I don't like. My relationship struggles sometimes because I'm always the person to say I need to drive, I need to book the tickets to make sure the times are right, I need to clean the house to make sure all of the mold in the shower is cleaned with the right kind of chemical because someone used hand soap before, etc.

Fortunately, being conscious has helped my relationship because I can identify the issues as they arise and apologize which works between my SO and me.

But what about other major things in life like my career? Is there advice for dealing with this? Can therapy help this kind of thing?",28Sep2017,2
16,"I don't really know what I'm asking for in all honesty. 

But basically my family has always been abusive, dysfunctional and such and both my parents are heavy drinkers. About two weeks ago my dad found out about my mom's affair and they constantly argue about it and the cops have been called literally five times since then. I really do wish I was making that number up but they go outside and scream at each other and my dad is hitting her and everything

I'm 16 and in four AP classes that require around 5 hours of homework a night and there's so much and I'm so behind and my GPA is already a 2.7 and my rank is the lower half of my class but I have so much work to do tonight that I can't process it all

Every day it seems like something new happens. My dad totaled my car so I can't drive anywhere and my mom got side swiped yesterday. My mom got kicked out of her medical program today because she broke her contract by leaving clinicals after my dad drained her bank account and she couldn't get food or gas or pay for parking. 

I have two younger siblings and my older sister wants me to just stay with them and take care of them and fund them because we both know my parents don't take care of them once they're divorced, and they won't even like fully separate until January. My dad is using us as leverage to spite my mom by turning us against her because of the affair but I'm not gonna just take his side because he's abusive to me and everyone else 

And I don't know what I'm asking for I just don't know what to do because nobody realizes I'm on this situation and I don't want to go to my counselor or drop any of my AP courses because I need to raise my GPA and rank and actually get good grades but this is all happening during my junior year which is critical to everything else and I'm expected to just take it all and everyone wants to drop me as the leader of my club at school because I haven't been doing much lately because I'm too caught up having to mediate between my mom and dad while I'm at home which forces me to do all my other work at school so I can't text anyone or communicated and I honestly can't understand how people actually enjoy these four years or have a normal family that actually cares about them and helps them do stuff because it's been like this for my whole life and before and it's just bad and earlier this month I kind of had a psychotic break and beat up two family members and attempted suicide and was arrested and brought to a mental.health facility but I couldn't get a psychiatrist because our insurance wasn't working and everyone has kind of forgot now but all of this is really recent and in the last two weeks where everything has gotten really bad and I'm starting to think bad thoughts again

17,"So I'm not here to try and complaint about how I think Im crazy or psychotic. I just have trouble functioning with other people and in this world. I will begin with laying down the structure of the problem and then going in to fill in the gaps with all the necessary bits. 
First off i have, in essence, two personalities  (not in the since of DID). The first one is energetic, charismatic, and can function. When I am here i wake up with energy, i'm motivated, and I do well in school. The second is the problem child. Here I struggle to communicate with people on the simplest levels. Im unmotivated for specific reasons(more on that). I have, what i believe to be, delusions (obviously i am not a mental health professional so i have no idea). 
So here is a more in depth veiw of the pair, as it is easier to compare and contrast than list specific qualities in sperate paragraphs. As i said its not DID, because i am the quintessential me in both cases not a completely separate being. I am aware of whats going on (to a degree for the second one) around me and can process the events and sort of remember them how i saw them when i was in that personality. I can almost be egocentric in the first one, like full of myself. I see it then but when I look back as the second i see that i was an ass. I believe i can do anything, even going as far to believe i was capable of joining the marines amd being an officer. I even told some people and nearly applied for the nrotc. Thank god i didnt. And now i have go to those people and do damage control. The second has a very low self-esteem. Hardly the only issue but is a major one. See when i am in second i think i am missing some fundamental aspect of life. Nothing i do is serious, because im just not in the (i guess i could say this) reality as everyone else. This is the reason for the lack of motivation. While in second i have been in this state in which i am nearly incapacitated. Ive only been in this state 2 or 3 times. Its very difficult to explain but ill do my best. I simply cant function i try but the more i try the worse i get. I am completely suicidal in the state. Luckly its only happened 2 or 3 times, but i fear if i get in that state while on a bridge or driving ill just jump or deliberately crash. I can say that the shortest time i every spent in this state was at school; i fell asleep fpr about a hour and woke up in first. To be clear second is not always like this but i never get in that state from first. Some of the things i find myself thinking and believing while in second is that people are stealing my personality. There is far more to this than people just being theives, but then this article would twice as long. I also have a need for a girlfriend or close companion while in second. But not in first, as i said i tend to be egocentric, so i dont think a girlfriend will help me because i am already great. But in second, a girlfriend is what i need, she will help me. I wouldnt rely on her for total support, but rather my good treatment of her would help me. But shouldnt get to into my ideas about relationships. There really is no reason for me to believe a girlfriend will help me, as i have never had one, but i just know that it will. 
The only reason im hear explaining all this to you today is that i am currently in the middle grpund between the two. Almost wrestling with my mind for control, i rapidly switch for first to second and second to first. For the most part i can function in school just fine (im a senior in high school). Like getting most of my  homework done and the such. I hope that who ever reads this can say something at least sort of encouging or some advise. But thanks for reading all the same. 

Jusy some extra info on me: i come from a standard nuclear family with no serious issues. I have not been diagnosed with any mental health issues. I have been diagnosed with ADD (if it does actually exist). I have been losing most of friends since freshman year, and now i can say i only have 2 close friends as opposed to about 14 in 8th grade.

19,"Bipolar Disorder is a Bitch

Please excuse bad format and grammatical errors. I'm running on very little sleep. 

In the beginning I had no idea what was happening to me. It took everything I had to ask for help. Though my pleas were unanswered (She only needs to talk. The first year of university is stressful. She just feels lost right now. There's nothing inherently wrong with my daughter; it's hard to venture out into the world alone!), it was already too late. 

Throughout the first year on campus, I was living high. I was invincible. Everything was glorious. The view of autumn leaves and cool breezes were almost orgasmic. I felt like I was an interesting, eclectic, beautiful person with brilliant ideas and looks to spare! Then something started happening that I couldn't understand. I lost chunks of time where I was so high on life that nothing mattered but what I was focused on in the moment, whether it be sex, art, knowledge, or anyone near enough to hear me sing or witness me dance in the streets.  Only when I came down, I knew there was a problem. After I exhausted any narcotics I could possibly get my hands on trying to achieve that high for life I once felt, I couldn't leave the bed. I either couldn't stop sleeping or wouldn't sleep at all. The mood swings I had weren't clear and wrapped in a pretty little bow. That's the first thing outsiders misunderstand about Bipolar Disorder. We are unable to realize the extent of problems we are having. We are incapable of diagnosing ourselves. We feel we have it made until we are depressed. Everyone I've known with Bipolar Disorder could only acknowledge the lowest of lows before becoming aware of the entirety of our disease. 

Our memories fail more often than not. I can't remember huge portions of my life. Even 5 medicated years later, I'm reminded of things that I've done, movies I've watched, conversations I've had that I do NOT in any way remember. 
 
My freshman year of college ended in one of many psychological breakdowns I've had throughout my life. These breakdowns included bizarre delusions that put myself and others in danger. 

The reason I am posting this on this sub is because you all understand the muck mentally ill people have to tread in. I am offended by ignorant people using Bipolar Disorder (or any other mental illness) as a joke to describe their pets' or acquaintances' behavior. It isn't funny, and I'm tired of it. I can't be the only one who notices this right?  I struggle every single day to have my illness become trivialized regularly along with other mental illnesses. 

I've had a bad day today. I feel guilt for the shit my SO puts up with. This is hard. One day I'll be looking at Facebook statuses and blow up on some random person calling their bf/gf Bipolar for suddenly changing their minds last minute or being hot-headed or posting about feeling unexplainably sad that day. 

Does this anger everyone dealing with a mental illness whether it is yourself or a loved one? Am I being a sensitive bitch for being offended?

28,"It's been about half a year now that my spouse has decided to take the leap to get off of Seroquel and Lamictal.


She has been prescribed 150mg Seroquel for many years and later on 200mg Lamictal during a difficult time in her life. From the moment I met her she told me she doesn't like what these meds, particularly the antipsychotic, do to herself. Obviously, the view through those glasses changes/scrambles your mental framework in quite mysterious ways  - so of course I fully backed her up in tapering off of these medications.


I've never been prescribed either of these meds, only took Seroquel once for helping to sleep (and to get a glimpse of it). Sleep is also the main reason why she was even still taking it when I met her. I believe her previous relationship left her in a pretty devastated frame of mind.


It took her around 2~3 months to fully get off the Lamictal, but the Seroquel has been a tougher one and we have moved down at a pace of like ~2mg per day, but the further we approach the day where she is free from all these psych meds, the worse our relationship becomes.

I just don't know how to deal with it anymore, I understand it's terrible, unbearable, and try to put myself in her shoes as much as humanly possible. It appears to me though that with the chemical changes, the mind also needs to adopt. I believe now she has put herself in deadlock, because between her full-time job, my full-time job and the rest of our obligations, there is hardly ever a time where we both feel alright and have the strength to make efforts to maintain our relationship.


She is emotionally dead by now, and I can't get my ass to be productive because I'm constantly sad, crying until I can't breathe anymore and on the verge of fainting on an almost daily basis. Sad that my partner in life might see life in a different light now, where I'm not of importance anymore; rather a utility to bring forth happiness, inspiration and a way to live.


If I wasn't so codependent, I could be what she needs right now, according to my own fragile state of mind. I'm not satisfied with anything anymore, and the stack of things that I need to do just keeps piling up.

As I slowly draw a piece of this Jenga tower each day.. only to find myself anxious again about what's going to happen this night.. I feel through her, I try to absorb her suffering, but maybe what's happening is just me making it worse.


I'm paranoid about her checking up on me how I'm failing again at whatever I attempt to deal with - the emotional outbursts are just *harsh*, don't think I'm just a wimp, I'm just trying to stop things from spiraling by trying to stay calm.

I can't deal with it anymore, I'm reaching my own limit of sanity, my mind starts to realize there is no solution to this puzzle. I have tried a million approaches, trying to keep up a good attitude but now we're just arguing almost every day.

32,"I have a question:

I am an extremely choleric person. If something - even if it is just a small little thing - doesn't work, like a interrupted YouTube video due to loading, I get really upset about it and start to use bad words. Same, when someone gets me on my nerves, then I'll insult him. I can't describe properly how angry I am then, its kind of like an old man being grumpy all the time, but in an extremely energetic form + all those countless bad words that are said by me.

I also act in an aggressive manner if I don't know how to do something I have never done before - like setting up a computer. Instead of staying cool and rationally looking at this, I am overwhelmed and eventually even start to cry because I am completely desperate.

Now the anxiety part: To be honest, this thing with setting up a computer (it's just an example - generally speaking it's about things I have never done before and having them to do for the first time) is a mix between anger and anxiety. The desperation I feel is the anxiety. If I don't know how to continue further on, the anxiety is literally making my bode shaking uncontrollably and I also can't calm myself down to speak understandably

I feel anxiety regards to the future. I lie every day in my bed thinking about my future. Especially about my studies at the university whose will start in 2 weeks. I simply can't relax, I am in constant anxiety 24/7 due to this. It's not only thinking about university, it's about thinking about the future. I also feel anxiety if I am about to hear an opinion from someone about my thoughts/decisions/etc.

I don't know if I need medication (I am polish, so if someone will recommend me something please something I can find in Poland). I don't know what to do and how to help myself, i don't like it

Remember that I am extremely choleric and irritable, too, so anxiety is not my only problem. I just don't know if these two things are linked together.

It's been quite a few months since I felt really sad, but that sense of hopelessness is something that I'm all too familiar with. The best way to describe my life is this: pure existence with a glimmer of hope. One that could easily be erased. Erase that hope and it becomes a mere existence without a purpose. This has happened before. On more than one occasion.

The few glimmers of hope that I currently have are almost a bit coincidental. Or at least one of them is. I met a girl online a few months ago. Maybe that'll lead somewhere? Probably not. And even if it does, it would probably only lead to a world full of problems. 

The other reason for my hopefulness is the thought of studying something I enjoy and that will lead to a job I'll enjoy. Will this be enough to erase all my problems? No, far from it. Sooner or later I'll end up in a deep pit of despair. I know this, and that's why it's only a matter of time before it gets to me again.

I fear my threshold is rather low. Take one of these out of the equation and I'll be one step closer to edge. Eventually I'll fall. This is inevitable. Or maybe it isn't? I long for answers I don't have. The biggest of them all is: will I ever be truly happy? I do not feel much sadness at this moment. These are just some of my everyday thoughts (happy thoughts, eh!?). The reasons I previously stated are pretty much the only reasons why a small part of me believes there's a chance that, at some point (maybe), I'll be truly happy (although the odds are stacked against me). Most likely though, and statistically (looking at my life so far), things will never change for the better. ",28Sep2017,1

44,"Am I the only one who starts to feel really, really, really depressed when I'm at parties or just events where everyone is happy?

Like I look around and everything looks picture perfect like a scene out of a movie and it just really saddens me. I see everyone so happy and having fun and I wonder why I can't be as chill as that, or I start to think about how they don't know half the shit that's going on in my head.

It's not jealousy, I don't feel the desire to be like them when this happens, but I just never seem to be able to enjoy myself at social events and gatherings. Like the party starts off fun, then by the time it's night, I'm just so mentally tired and I just want to cry for no reason at all. Like I've been through alot, yet those feelings I get at the end of parties and driving home are probably one of the worst things ever.

I haven't been to a party in ages because of this and I was invited to one tomorow night. I don't know if I should go. If anyone experiences similar feelings, please share your opinions or suggestions on how to make it suck less.",28Sep2017,5
45,"I have always felt very alone, but not really in a ""sad"" way. I just know I'm not the same as others.

I have always felt that people in general are just fools and I have always found it very easy to manipulate people to get what I want. I have never struggled to sway people to what I want them to do. 

I had a very normal upbringing, I think. I am 20 now and a college student, but I grew up in an upper middle class home with both parents present and two siblings. Never struggled for anything. I attended private school for K-12 and now I am at a university in the next state over. 

Emotion has always been a very difficult thing for me to show and understand, though I have learned how to fake it I think. But from my childhood continuing up to now, I am very destructive to other people. Sometimes I don't mean to be. Other times I do. Neither makes me feel bad. ""Romantic"" Relationships, if you want to call it that, are a prime example of this for me. I charm, lie, manipulate, and dump people out like trash when I'm done. Several ""serious"" girlfriends have gotten this treatment when I just decided I wanted something else instead.

I lie a lot to get what I want. I have no qualms about lying but I also sometimes tell the blunt truth to get what I want as well. Both hurt people. 

I recently discovered that there are names for psychological disorders other than the basic depression disorders, and I don't know if I really fall under any of these categories.

46,"Okay so this is so so stupid. I know it is but its actually scaring me to the point I cant relax and has moved me onto thinking (at my lowest) that the only way to stop is to end it.

Let me explain, lately stupid things on the tv, in the news etc have been frying my brain.

A couple of weeks ago, i was legit terrified in case i accidentally ever took heroin. Heart pumping, feeling sick - feeling like i need a knife to dig these thoughts out of my head. This happens with anything... news stories etc. I'm constantly petrified of ""What if i end up like that?"" I scare myself by going into so much detail how much it would effect my family and friends etc.

The one that is driving me insane right now is a man at my work - i didnt know him personally but said hello a few times. He seemed normal. It turned out he was pedo. It has sent my brain into over drive.

I can't understand how someone who seemed so normal can be so twisted. Now I get seriously panicked that I could turn out like that, the person next to me could turn out like that or someone i know really well could turn out like that... Its actually exhausting.

Theres more too, What if i accidentally kill someone. What if i get arrested for drug dealing. I AM NOT INVOLVED IN ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO ANY OF THIS STUFF. 

How do i calm myself down and stop being so silly? I'm immediately jumping to the worst case scenario of anything i see/hear. I know im doing it, i just cant stop it? 

I'm a 26 year old male. I have a great life. I'm just all of a sudden worried about absolutely everything. Im so tired, I just want to sit quietly and have an empty head without these unwanted thoughts or worries trying to break in and get me worked up.

Any advice would be ideal",28Sep2017,1

49,"All my life i have always thought stuff was normal in how i function but a few days ago one of my friends pointed a few things out to me, I never eat food from containers or that other people make, and i always use silverware i have seen and made sure no one did anything too. I always think people are lying to me and for a while thought my mom and brother were trying to frame me for something, and as much as i can wipe my fingerprints of of things. Whenever i get into my car alone, i always say ""Hey are you ready to go?"" to catch any potential people in the backseat off guard, and i often am looking behind me and watching people like i think they're going to attack. I feel like this all sounds super edgy but that's how i deal with stuff normally.

What pushed me over the edge to post this is i see a person more and more lately, taking pictures of me (who i usually ignore and walk away faster) just far enough to where i cant see his face and whenever i try to find out who it is he either disappears or walks behind something, not to be there when i look. I hate cameras, even in supermarkets i look away and look down and in most of my family photos i'm not looking at the camera or begrudgingly doing so as my mom commanded me to.

I sleepwalk a lot and my mom always says that i'm almost not sleepwalking and seem to be mostly conscious in my actions and i usually don't remember doing a lot of things that people say i do, which led me to think i have a slight memory problem but nothing too serious.

lastly i feel like i can see 1 out of ever 20 or so people looking at me as i walk by them but not just a quick glance more like a complete deadpan stare (walking outside or in the halls of my college) and i hear my name a lot in others conversations like if everything they say is in another language then out of nowhere they say my name.

Idk if this is normal but the guy who takes pictures thing is making me feel more and more worried. I always thought what i did normally was well, normal but lately I've been questioning that.  but nothing extremely traumatic has happened in my life that i feel could lead to this, so i was hoping to get a second opinion from people who may have dealt with this before.",28Sep2017,1

51,"- i feel like i'm a walking contradiction, and i complicate things to no end. my strongest desire in life is to experience true love, raw intimacy, and a deep connection with the love of my life - my soulmate... but i'm afraid to love too hard. i yearn for complete acceptance of who i am, but i hold back because i can't help feeling concerned about how others perceive me. i want to pour my heart out to the ones i love, but i end up pushing them away and building up walls because i suck at expressing my emotions. i struggle between wanting certain people to notice when i'm upset and wanting to hide behind a mask as if everything's fine. my self-esteem always fluctuates between feeling confident and insecure all the time. i fear abandonment, but constantly test my boyfriend by complicating things to see if he'll leave me. i work hard to gain my parents' love because i'm their least favorite child, but i also rebel against them and working hard is a struggle (i used to get terrible grades, i procrastinate hard, sleep little hours, and can't be punctual to save my life). i love alone time because i get to just do my own things, but i hate being alone because i'm clingy. i always want to be around my boyfriend and/or friends, but sometimes i feel suffocated. i'm careful with my words and actions because conflict stresses me out, but i'm petty and can't resist throwing shade / acting passive-aggressive when offended even if that means facing conflict because i'm also impulsive. my boyfriend makes me feel special, but i'm easily threatened by other girls whenever he speaks to or even look at them. i have high standards and expectations of others, but i also doubt them and am skeptical about their intentions. 


- i'm a worrier and i'm emotional. i often worry if my parents will be mad at me for things that i do, if my boyfriend's going to leave me, if i'm doing well in school, if people are judging me, if i look good enough, etc. i tend to envision things in my future and fantasize about how my life will be, but stop myself at some point because i'm afraid i'm getting my hopes up if they don't come true. i'm a pessimist and i beat myself up over the smallest things. my day could be ruined just because someone stepped on my white shoes. i'd spend the rest of my day worrying if people are going to notice the stain and judge me for having dirty shoes. it's irrational, i know. sometimes i get emotional to the point where i make decisions i later regret. i once almost changed my mind about attending my dream college with my best friends because i was so upset that my boyfriend wasn't going there too. i've tried to commit suicide more than once before. i can hardly go a week without crying and/or getting mad about something. i'm constantly envious. i constantly read into things and overthink. i cry at movies, books, songs, etc. i have frequent mood swings, too. i often feel like people are against me and i’m constantly worried about people judging me. 


- i blow up my money on beautiful things all the time even though i try to save up. i often miss school notes because i spend too much time making my notes look pretty. i write in all lowercase because it looks prettier to me. i'm considering plastic surgery in the future because i don’t feel attractive enough even though people everywhere always compliment me on my looks. i filter all of my instagram pictures a certain way and spend over half an hour choosing what i want to post. i refuse to post certain pictures on my instagram because they'll ruin the aesthetic i have going on. i spend a lot of time putting together my outfits, and i'm never not dressed up when i go out. appearance flaws stress me out like crazy; a wrinkle on my top has to be ironed, my shoelaces and jean cuffs must be identical, my makeup must perfect, my hair can't have any flyaways, etc. i starve myself whenever i gain even 1 pound even though i know it could just be water weight. my bmi claims i'm underweight, but i still feel fat sometimes and refuse to gain weight. 

- some people think i'm selfish, unpredictable, and snobby. i'm too focused on myself that i sometimes forget to consider other people's feelings. people call me unpredictable because one day i'd be laughing at a joke someone makes about me, but the next day i'd be offended by that same joke. 


- my dad has always been abusive to me; growing up, he made comments like, “you’re ugly you need to work on your appearance” and “no one will ever want to date you.” he also hits me sometimes even to this day. he’s kind of controlling sometimes; he hates my boyfriend because he thinks i’m “going to become a slut” and doesn’t approve of our relationship even though my boyfriend treats me so well. he gets mad if i come home late, and he expects too much from me. i go to school, am involved in sports afterschool, and work evenings until night pretty much every day, but he still doesn’t think i’m good enough. i spend a lot of time by myself when i’m at home and hardly even leave my room unless i have to eat. 


- when i was really young, i was super quiet and had no friends. i cried almost every day in school and gave up on a playground game (four square) because i sucked. i eventually met one of my best friends who i admired back then. she was what i wasn't; brave, confident, outgoing, competitive, outspoken, and sassy just to name a few. i realized one day that i was trying to be her - trying to emulate her qualities. as a preteen, i fooled myself into believing that i was exactly like her. once i got into high school, i realized that isn't who i actually am. i was simply trying to be her because i idolized her and wasn't satisfied with myself. now i know who i am, but i'm not comfortable being exactly who i am to everybody in public. i feel like i have an image to maintain and i hate it, but i can't abandon it. almost nobody knows what really goes on in my mind or how i'm actually feeling. most don't even know half of what i expressed just now besides my inner circle. they see what i want them to see even if i'm not that great at upholding my facade.

55,"First of all, I'm sorry if I chose the wrong subreddit to post this on, I'm new to Reddit and have mostly been browsing r/askreddit.

My problem is, my best friend seems to be going through an identity crisis. Now I'm not completely sure whether she is or not, since she hasn't bothered to see anyone about it and she honestly doesn't exactly know herself but at least to me it looks like an identity crisis. The things she's told me she struggles with are:

•Feeling dissociated(I'm not a native speaker, please correct me if I'm wrong)with her past self

•Not knowing who she is, what makes her herself etc (basically anything beyond what's factual e.g. she having periods etc, thus she's a girl)

•Not being able to name why she likes something 

•Thoughts just stop forming, as in, she just ends up completely blank

And so her solution was, I need some time for myself. In this case that meant completely removing herself from her friends' lives. Being unreachable via texting and avoiding almost everyone. Since she isn't sure why she'd like something, she's also unsure whether she actually likes her friends or not.

I want to do something about this because she's done so much for me in the past and doing nothing and leaving her alone really seems like I'm giving up on her. I understand why she thinks that distancing herself is a good idea, and honestly I don't have a better idea, but I just... I want to be able to do something, or at least know for sure that leaving her alone for now is the right thing to do. Having mental issues myself, I've taken her absence hard and I just want to know what a high school student could do to help out his best friend.

(Again, sorry if I'm on the wrong subreddit or even on the wrong site, I'm just unsure where to ask or what to do)

Edit: 
I should also note that I think she's overworking herself, she has a lot of schoolwork to do, has a part-time job and has a lot of hobbies and I'm afraid she literally has no time to simply unwind

56,"The U.S. culture is obsessed with race and sexuality. The right pisses me off because they think only a certain race are true Americans or own the place and yet people say race doesn't matter yet commercials for products like AncestryDNA and 23andme are everywhere on TV. The left pisses me off with its obsession with concepts like gender and the recent coverage popularity in transgender people. Then I get thinking that the two are related or one causes the other. I've recently discovered that I feel feminine when I insult the U.S. military or certain structures praised by the right, and when I bring up the concept of race to people on the left they are in denial yet love developing concepts dealing with gender which I think have a lot to do with race and ethnicity. Then I realize the only cure is to be a manual slave laborer like a migrant worker to keep one's mind off these things then I realize that these slave workers are people from countries that recently went through huge demographic shifts and lots of manipulation to keep said countries in order: Latin American countries. The only reason the Mexican flag now has an eagle which is based off an Aztec legend was so that the Spanish elites could please the growing mestizo population. Things like that. Then I realize the U.S. is doing the same thing with its obsession with race COUPLED with its obsession with sexuality. Just watch the Rick and Morty show or browse YouTube trending videos. It's everywhere now. Also, once you learn about these concepts it's impossible to go back to your ""primitive"" country without feeling like a thought criminal or radical, and due to the U.S.'s hate of bilingualism your other language is subpar and you'll never fit into your original country again. Then you realize the U.S. is a communist country for trying to keep you in. Or you realize that countries are the way the animalistic side of humans manifests itself in the world and that's what things like religion, e.x. Christianity, try to talk about which then makes you feel like an asshole (which bring about the disgusting feminine feelings) for debunking. Or that morals are subjective. Then when you realize you can take on the mindset of different races and ethnicities like some psychopathic computer programmer, taking on the mindset of the opposite sex is no longer an impossibility, but that route leads to homosexuality which further alienates one from the world AND makes them stand out (I don't want to stand out). The new Stephen Colberts of TV like Samanthe Bee now use Tumblr terminology (the main aspect that disturbs me is them saying sexuality is fluid and that there are no differences in male and female brains which then makes it possible for anyone to become a transvestite) and shows like Fox news are /pol/ (which are heavy on the race realism stuff). I have lots of uncles who were born in Mexico and came to the U.S. legally at a young age, but only one is gay and he is the only one that lives in the past by still only watching Spanish-language television, listening only to old music like this https://youtu.be/ywJt0b7GGT8 , only speaking Spanish, wanting to travel a lot to only Mexico, watching futbol instead of football or baseball, ... All the others are married, own their own home, and most served in the U.S. military. Also, thanks to products like AncestryDNA and 23andme, labels like ""Hispanic"" and ""Chicano"" don't mean anything. If a ""Chicano"" makes a video on YouTube the YouTube comments have comments like: ""she is a Gypsy, not a Mexican"", ""he looks Syrian, not Mexican"", ""he is Spanish, not Mexican"", ""she is Jewish, no Mexican"", ... basically labels used in monoethnic/monoracial countries because now the world is a lot smaller thanks to the internet which means Independence for countries in the new world no longer matter.

I wish I could take on the consciousness of another creature for which humans don't mind like a bird, that way I won't be subject to psychological warfare dealing with human racial/heritage pride or human sexual manipulation (I guess that's what drug addicts try to accomplish).

Since then I haven't been evaluated mentally at all.

Background: I'm in my late twenties and have a decent office based finance job. I go to the gym, play sports, eat well and have a lot of good friends to spend time with. I have had some history of anxiety; this has lead to short periods of isolation for fear of judgement. Nothing quite like this has happened, though.

I had the day off work on Monday but got up at 7am, as I normally do. I got ready for the day and headed out to do some errands. That didn't go according to plan. Having got to my first destination I sat in the car for some time and then just drove home. 

I can barely recall any of what happened between Monday morning and 15 minutes ago.

The entire week has passed me by in a blur. I didn't go into work the last three days, and I don't really know why. I've barely spoken to anyone and had hundreds of messages on my phone when I just checked. Though, I've been out of the house, I can't really remember when/where and I'm not sure if I've slept and even where, which is more than a little unnerving.

Has this ever happened to anyone? The last 15-20 minutes have been a complete head wreck, trying to make some sense of what happened. Maybe it's depression but I can't recall any negative thoughts and there aren't any lingering now. If someone's experienced this maybe they can give me some tips on what to say to work.
