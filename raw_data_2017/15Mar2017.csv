0,"Hi,

So I've had depression for a few years now. My Bf knew this before he asked me out so it was no surprise to him. I used to get upset and his own words I became emotionally dependent on him for happiness. He called me a 'burden' on him and told me he didn't love me. I later took him back although it was agreed I wouldn't mention my illness again to him.

The next few months there was only a few minor blips. Although he became more controlling advising me to take up hobbies, get out of bed earlier to stop me oversleeping, eat healthier and exercise. He went as far to say that he would find me more attractive if I were to lose weight (I'm 10.5 stone for those wondering). Comments also became focused on my clothes, make-up and general appearance. He began to show lack of respect in terms of disappearing off to other commitments such after I had an operation and mid way through my birthday meal for example.

I was wondering if it is possible my depression and dependence on him drove him to behave in this way? All I ever did was love him but I'm not sure why he even bothered to stay with me if this is how he felt. He even joked that he was my carer but we'd see each other a few hours a week normally at the most. At some points he banned texting during the day.

So the advice I'd really appreciate is what I can learn from this for future relationships? Do you think my depression made him treat me like this because he felt I was a burden? Should I hide my illness to future partners?

Thank you ",15Mar2017,2

2,"So I've been reading up on depersonalization because I feel as though I might have it. I go to therapy every couple weeks or so and I've been diagnosed with anxiety and I've read that's common with dprd.

Is it supposed to be triggered by nostalgia? Because whenever I go somewhere or remember a certain memory that happened in the past I go into this cloudy state of feeling like I'm living in a bubble in that moment and I feel very spaced out. This usually only lasts a few days (sometimes a week or so at most) and then it's gone. It's been coming back a lot lately though and I just get so panicky and touchy during this time until I snap back.

I've been doubtful because whenever I read about dprd I see symptoms that are super severe and it just happens here and there for me (it's still awful though I'm so lucky it's not a daily thing for me)

But I do sometimes just forget me, people around me and pretty much everything else exists for small amounts of time (this isn't too bad it's just kind of odd and I space out again)

I've been asking my other friends and a lot of them don't share similar feelings so I thought here would be a good place to hear other people's opinions who might have the same feelings.",15Mar2017,2

(This takes place a few months just after high school graduation)

I began to feel uneasy with the world around me- I constantly felt like nothing good was happening- or my life had gone completely stagnant. My parents said its because I've
been cooped up in this house so long that I've burned out on home life. They Might just be right- but things continue. I began to grow more and more stressed- constantly changing
my room to stupid layouts just because it was a change, I seemed to have developed a strong feeling- almost a fetish of getting furniture- some of it not even needing!


I was going insane! I started to fight with others- I even began to stop playing games some days- I am an avid gamer.
Some days I don't even bother to get out of bed. And worst of all the thought of completely giving up has crossed my mind. I don't mean suicide- I mean just stop functioning physically and
emotionally- If I die I die, too bad- that kind of thing. I'm often keeping these thoughts to myself mainly because my family would look at me like a complete wacko and would probably try to find me therapy or some crap.


I'm starting to get almost depressed when I finish a game with a story due to the fact that I feel that the world in there is much more suitable and exciting than the one out here. I WANT SOME CHANGE.


I feel like I would just die alone in a sad 1-bedroom apartment with a crappy 9-5 desk job with menial pay and crippling debt. HELP. I'm basically running off raw advice at this point. I'm hurting people. I want to be known on both the internet and irl. I don't want to retain my ""good boy"" reputation anymore. I want to be a rogue but still be a hero!",15Mar2017,1

8,"Okay, I am going to make this as short as possible. My mind is not normal, and I've been using my abnormalities to my advantage all my life. 

Essentially I constantly adopt emotions, and have never had personal emotions before. I look to others to adopt the most appropriate emotional state, if I overhear a discussion on depression I'm depressed for a long period of time, if I hear or read material on happiness I become overly happy.

Obviously this sounds ridiculous, but these are almost like triggers, alternating between periods of mania and depression upon exposure to emotions from others.

I've known about this mechanism for some time, and used it to study. Exposing myself to successful people increases my drive, makes me feel like I'm high on something. 

I don't know whether this is the result of priming, or something else. I've searched around but have found details on no similar symptoms. 

Obviously there is nothing ""wrong with me"" in the case that I am not going to commit suicide, but something tells me that I am still not normal, that I constantly look to others to create emotions, and without exposure am left hollow. 

Can anyone help. 

Thanks. ",16Mar2017,1

I'm not sure if this is my mental illness paired with my hormones but everyday is worse than the next. I'd like to believe I'm extremely creative, but my life on a day to day basis is so fucked up I can't even explain it. If I could pair it to a color I would mix grey with black, I can't keep living my life in such a fucking bubble of structure and rigidity. I think there are some days that are better than the rest but I wear a mask of happiness &amp; nonchalantness almost 365 days in public but at home I'm such a sad individual. I know everyone else is too, why is everyone hiding? I design clothes &amp; help direct film, I also smoke a ton of weed because if we're being honest- it keeps my mind idle, and I'm scared of what my mind will wander into when I'm not high. I have insanely creative and out of the box ideas but sometimes it feels like no one listens. I think every single day I stay stuck in this system I deteriorate a little more inside. I don't want you all to think I'm some hormonal teenager because I've felt a little different since I was 10 (back then everyone used to fuck with me and think I was this terrible kid), it honestly feels like I'm in a heightened state of consciousness 24/7 and the high makes me feel ""normal"" I guess *insert shrug*. I need a way out into the real world, I can't keep living like this. I think mental illness is in my genetic makeup, one of my parents suffers from Depression &amp; bipolar disorder and the other one is too detached. Basically I'm just writing this to tell myself there are other people like me because a couple weeks ago I forced myself to stop smoking everything started feeling too numb and now my mind is fucking me :(

29,"I will start off by saying that I am not really sure which sub to use for this question. Ever since I can remember, my mother has displayed some rather unusual behaviors. Often times, especially when she is stressed out, she will start whispering to her self followed by a chuckle and then more whispers. We have been on the phone at times and she has zoned out and began to do this (which as you can imagine can be quite disturbing). When she is in a good mood, she will just laugh for hours in her bedroom. She claims she is ""just thinking"" but will never have a specific funny event to share. In general, my mom is quite distant (in her own world). She has no problem having a long rant about her issues but it seems as soon as anyone else starts talking about themselves, she zones right out. At one point, the zoning got so bad that even if you snapped your fingers in front of her face she would not react. Once she threw herself on the floor and starting screaming at me while pounding her fists on the floor ""I want milk!!"". A few years ago, she stopped taking her anti-psychotics and she saw a person who was not there in the corner of our apartment. Is this associated with any personality disorder? I couldn't find anything similar on the internet.  The symptoms change from what seems like one condition to the next over the years. 



Background: My mother has been diagnosed over the years with everything under the sun. PTSD, Anxiety, Bi polar 2, Multiple personality disorder, borderline personality disorder (dissociative identity disorder), recently even ADD. She can not have all of these things. Any insight would be appreciated. I can go into further detail of her other symptoms if desired.",16Mar2017,2

Like what the hell are you supposed to even talk about with the therapist. All I can say pretty much is that ""I am thinking about how depressed I feel"" and I cannot pinpoint anything specific whatsoever making me feel that way. Then all they suggest is focusing on other things and exercise but thats pretty much all they suggest. No matter who I go to. It doesn't help at all and despite doing those things I still remain depressed or anxious. Then sometimes they suggest mindfulness but that doesn't help either--I still feel the same before and after and in fact most of the time I feel more agitated after.

Im so anxious about my problem going away that I cannot even do therapy.

Recap of my mental condition

 January 2016 I went to the hospital with the intention to be diagnosed and treated for ADD. I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, and anxiety. ( the long lived state of depression was at the time roughly 6 years long.) Starting when my parents split up at 10 years old, and me being 16 at that time. I've been on medication since, it's not completely helping right now but I'm working on that and have an appointment set with my doctor. I've never consider the possibility of me having separation anxiety before. But I never thought that I had anxiety until entering a relationship with someone who was able to educate me on the signs of anxiety. I now see that I do have struggles with anxiety especially over the past few months with them getting worse. My anxiety attacks have been coming on more commonly, thankfully I've recently learned a way to stop them before they take over.
(I was diagnosed with ADD one month ago Feb 2017)

Anxiety triggers, and other related info

•Fighting/ arguing with loved ones.

•Unexpected/ unplanned departure from loved ones

•Remembering the first point

•Sometimes I will just get really sad, at this point I don't want to live at the moment, and this triggers my anxiety because I really do want to live a long happy life

•I'm very attached to my girlfriend, and can get really jealous. (I usually don't let it show but it just dwells with me in my mind)

• I sometimes  feel like if I can't make a loved one happy then it is my fault for their current state of sadness. I'm aware I didn't induce it but I feel it's my obligation to see them happy.( Bringing joy, and laughter to people is one of the only things that bring me real happines)


My girlfriend of one year that I mention above has BPD, one of her symptoms include separation anxiety so I do have a first hand look on the condition.

45,"I just listened to a podcast with a psychologist who talks about the exercises he uses with patients. Example:

Exercise #1, Phobias: Break down the specific elements of the fear into several pieces and try to overcome each piece and create an A-Z journey.

Exercise #2, Regret: The psychologist describes regret as your soul being trapped in the past and how each memory that elicits a negative emotional response needs to be evaluated and learned from, much like a ""what doesn't kill us makes us stronger"", so you can move forward.

These are all just basic summaries of those examples, but I'm referencing them because I'm here in /r/MentalHealth, soliciting your help for a motivation exercise that would be similar. I really need it right now. I need a worksheet on motivation that I can fill-out for this problem I'm having.

--

Problem: I'm feeling unmotivated to go to Jiu Jitsu class, despite an absolute passion for it that I think about everyday 

I have a gym class membership in Minnesota. It's both expensive and the learning curve is noticeable. I mention those because, if I don't go, I regret wasting my money on it and also worry that my classmates, who were once novice level, are getting better than me. It's a martial art called Jiu Jitsu...

-I want to become a black belt in it, which takes a decade to achieve, which is another reason why it's time critical. I've wanted this for several years, but I'm not even 25% there. There is a lot of regret in waiting so long to pursue this, compounded by the days that I don't show up to class.

-I want to fight other people in Jiu Jitsu tournaments. But I'm afraid of losing, to the point where I don't like losing to classmates during practice, so it becomes this Catch 22 where I'm afraid of losing during practice but I'm not getting any better because I don't go to class.

-I want to become fitter and stronger from it. But over-exertion can severely damage my 38 year old body. It's common for people to take a break from or drop out of Jiu Jitsu due to injury, and I've had many chronic health problems from it, which I've healed via rest and which adds to the problem of not going to class (I might get hurt, nag an old injury, or maybe I should wait another day and rest up).

Those are three motivations I've listed, along with complimentary demotivations. Are there any exercise worksheets out there I could use to outline all those things I listed and more, so I can break down what it is I love and hate about Jiu Jitsu, in order to help me overcome my demotivation? I could really use it right now.

**Please note: I'm not really looking for comments that contain motivational advice, but thank you in advance.** A few motivational sentences will not purge this ghost that's haunting my House of Jiu Jitsu because I've tried all that before. What I really want is an exercise I can apply to my interest and disinterest to break it all down, look at what I love, look at what I hate, and draw out the ghost, so I can trap it or free it. Is there anything out there?

46,"So three weeks ago I sent [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/5vrt60/should_i_let_people_know_that_i_suffer_from/) in which I asked advice whether or not to let two groupmates of mine from college know that I suffer from a mental illness, depression and in particular an anxiety disorder that often makes mess up things a bit. Well, in the end, after reading carefully the replies and evaluating what to do, I didn't tell them. Two days ago I wasn't feeling well, due to a cardiac disturb - nothing serious or life-threatening, but quite debilitating -, but I did my part of the job anyway. I messed it up. One of them got angry and kicked me out of the group.  
I'll also add that it's *not* because I am not capable to do what we do,  one even said I may be the best out of the three. 

The absurd thing is, in general: If I say I'm having a heart problem - which as I said I often do -, everybody's like ""Oh, don't worry, take it easy, rest, get well soon..."" ... if it's because of anxiety or depression - which are, as we know, **illnesses** just the same, and actually rn I'm much more at risk of dying because of depression than due to my cardialogical problems - it's simply ""Snap out of it.""

I love gaming, and my favourite game right now is LoL, but as of late, no game cheers me up, nothing cheers me up actually. My friends invite me to go out with them, I accept usually, but I never really want to go. I spend hours on my computer doing nothing, because I don't know what to do. I don't feel anything. This has been happening for a while, but I didn't give it much thought until yesterday, when my crush said she wasn't interested in me, and I literally felt nothing. The whole situation was indifferent to me. I'm supposed to feel sad, heartbroken, something, not be like this and feel nothing. Are these signs of depression? I feel tired all the time, I don't have trouble sleeping and I haven't had suicidal thoughts yet. Any help?
