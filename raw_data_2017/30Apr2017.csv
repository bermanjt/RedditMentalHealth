1,"Hey, first time posting here.

I'm in the UK, but came from Lithuania. Basically, for pretty much my whole life I've had a thing that happened every so often where I jump from normal, or maybe even good mood into the absolute pit of despair and the only solution I see at the time is suicide. These urges and thoughts are extremely compeling and it's getting easier to control but a lot more frequent, so now I have it around every few days for about 30 mins. I've acted on these urges before but I'm still here. These feelings come about completely randomly and there does not need to be any cause to it. I don't take any sort of medication and am quite healthy overall. I know this isn't professional help, but I'm curious if anyone has anything similiar or has any idea if there may be any sort of underlying issue that is causing it. 

Feel free to ask any extra info if you feel like that would help you understand the situation better. ",30Apr2017,1
2,"Hey. I've been on Wellbutrin/Bupropion and Cipralex/Lexapro for about two years as otherwise I cannot control my depression. 

I feel like I have a strong brain fog and strong intense difficulty to concentrate. Psy prescribed me ritalin because I kept complaining about not being able to concentrate and failing in my studies which was affecting me even more in terms of being a failure etc. It was actually quite hard to get because I needed some sort of gov authorization, clearance and panel approval but basically i got after few months. (Im not in the usa)

I tried it for few weeks which happened to be a month before my exams and didn't feel any difference at all. I know that people get that stuff to help them with studying or get high in parties but I literally felt 0 difference while taking them. We initially tried concerta but it did nothing either. 

Since I still had some, I tried them again this week (pre-exam too) and again I felt no difference. 

How can it be possible ? 

Sometimes I wonder if my brain fog is so intense that I just feel nothing and I'm zombied/detached from my feelings? ",30Apr2017,1

Some days I'm totally fine, some days my husband can't touch me and I'll only wear loose clothes. At night my husband was trying to cuddle me and I told him to stop and took the blanket off too because I could feel it all too much.

19,"Hi everyone

I need a bit of help with a friend of mine. For context, we're in the UK. ""Fraser"" and I have been friends for 15 years. We're both in our early 30's. Been through quite a lot of crap together but we're both still standing.

Last September/October I started to notice something wasn't right. He was less and less available and eventually stopped returning all calls/emails etc. We have a mutual friend in common who would often report to me that Fraser was ""doing ok"" but I had no idea what that really meant.

Fast forward to yesterday. He finally gets in touch and we have a brief chat - he was admitted to a psychiatric unit a few days ago but was scarce on the details of why he's been admitted. He did say his anxiety is out of control.

I am going to visit him tomorrow but I am worried that I don't know what to say/do to help improve the situation. I asked him if he wanted anything brought to him. He said no, but then eventually asked if I could take him episodes of a TV show he likes (of course, no problem). 

Any advice you can offer would be GREATLY appreciated x

25,"I'm probably going to have a checkup sometime soon with my family doctor because of a new medication I'm on, and one of the symptoms of the medication is possible depression/mood changes so I'm probably going to be asked about my mental health even if its in passing.

The only thing I want to bring up and feel even slightly ok talking about would be depression and general stress, but I'm pretty sure I've been experiencing depression for the past 4 or 5 years. Which is going to be an awkward ""so why didn't you talk about this in the past 4 years at all.""

So I guess I'm just curious about other people's experience with bringing mental health shit up or know how the whole talking-about-mental-health thing goes down? Other than asking me questions about my feelings, which is a given. I've heard people say they've been given papers with questionnaires with really basic questions like ""have you been feeling tired/worthless/etc in the past two weeks?"" and told to fill them out, and then they received a dx.

I think I'd honestly just prefer a questionnaire because when it comes to my thought and feelings I clam up and feel like I literally can't talk sometimes and speaking out loud makes me so uncomfortable.

Can I be vague? Do I need a lot of details or examples? In addition to having extreme difficulty talking about this kind of thing to people I'm kind of forgetful..

Is there any risk of hospitalization if you admit to thinking about suicide even if its ideation and no plans or intent or anything? because I don't think I need to be hospitalized and that's not something I want to deal with if there's any risk. I'm leaning more towards just not mentioning it entirely, is there any particular reason to?

Beyond that I'm assuming the only solutions they will present are trying out basic meds or seeing a psychologist or therapist. Are gps able to prescribe meds for mental health problems without a psychiatrist? I'm not interested in seeing a psychiatrist, therapist, or anyone else right now. I'm in the USA, for reference.

And then the other half of my question: what do depression meds even feel like? I've been unhappy for a long time and people always talk about ""being able to be who I was before the depression"" but I was a child back then and I'm an adult now, and I definitely don't like who I used to be, so that gives me nothing/no idea of what being on them actually feels like. I can't imagine being a genuinely happy person or anything, especially because my depression is worsened by my current life circumstances, and I feel like feeling sad about them won't go away if they don't.

Also, is it important to mention anxiety/any other kinds of symptoms? As in, would it be dangerous in any way to be prescribed depression meds if I didn't bring them up? I know with some mental illness some kinds of meds for one can make the other one worse but I'm not sure if it applies in this instance.",01May2017,1
26,"A friend of mine (who I will refer to as E) and I are both users of reddit, and we both are aware of each others usernames. I browse her submissions, though I'm not sure if she browse mine.

They use Reddit in a way which reveals her inner thoughts and challenges with life, presumably as her username grants anonymity to them. But I know both the person in real life, and the person that behind the username

I have recently learned that they are dealing with depression to the extent that it is affecting her life in a major ways: grades are slipping; she is no longer enjoying hobbies like video games the way that she used to be, though she has mentioned that she still enjoys our nearly weekly D&amp;D session; and she has either been very close to self-harm or has actually gone through with it.

And I would have never guessed what she was going through if I hadn't read through her comments on /r/depression and the like, she has built a mask so convincing that when I told another friend of ours, he had no idea that E was depressed at all. Even with hindsight, the clues were few and far between and they were so very subtle that they were nearly imperceptible, so I am very grateful for knowing what her reddit account is.

I'm aware that I need to proceed carefully, as reddit is the main, if not the only, outlet for these feelings, and I would hate to make it so that she has to filter what she says. But I also know that inactivity is also not an option in this, as I am one of two people who know of the issue.

How do I help, how do I even offer it? How do I even approach the subject in conversation, do I mention that I've read her reddit comments, and now know of the problem? I have zero clue in how to do this :/

33,"hey to whoever's reading this, thanks for your time.

I've been struggling with life a lot as of late and in all honesty I'm totally lost on what I'm doing and it's putting a real strain on my already fragmented mental health.

I'm 19, I spend and have spent most of my teen years in my bedroom, playing video games, watching movies etc. I didn't go to school a lot, mainly because I spent so long feeling sorry for myself and my dad never really forced me to go to school after my mum died in 2012.

In those 5 years since her passing I've failed my GCSEs and A Levels, spunked £24k of inheritance on drugs, alcohol and video games. Somehow I've managed to get a car and a stable job and I'm trying my hardest to uphold them. Me and my dad have a very fragile relationship and so we don't talk much about anything, so a lot of these problems I deal with on my own. 

I'm at a point now where I can see where I want to be and I can see who I want to be, but taking that first step in bettering yourself and not failing after 2 days is tough. I've tried so many times to shake my addictions, my laziness and my general disdain for existence but one way or another they come back to bite me.

In all honesty I'm asking for guidance. I can't go a day without indulging myself in my bad habits and I feel like I'm waking up and doing the same damn thing day in day out, accomplishing nothing. I don't really have a lot of friends so I guess that's why I feel the need to rant on here.

Thanks guys",01May2017,2
34,"I used to think that mental health care for teens was a pretty rare thing because I could never in a million years imagine that my parents would ever get it for me and I figured most parents were the same. They always yell at me when I show any signs of being stressed out and say that I have no *real* reasons to get stressed because I'm not an adult (my mom also talks about how she has the easiest low stress job, so I'm supposed to be less stressed than her). But I know plenty of people my age that go to therapists and psychiatrists. Even people with downright abusive parents still have counselors. 

I had some extremely bad issues (depression and social anxiety) back in 5th grade and for the whole year I basically did no work, made no friends, developed terrible insomnia,  and procrastinated on everything and I pretty much just got yelled at to work, despite this being a complete turn around from how I was before. Looking back, the fact that I didn't get brought to see a counselor is completely bizarre and probably one of the biggest failures by literally every single adult in my life at the time. 

In middle school I continued the cycle of procrastination, but still got good grades in the end because turning in assignments late didn't have a penalty. Still, it should have been a red flag that I hadn't made a single friend for 2 entire years and despite being pretty smart for my age, wouldn't do the work. 

Between the summer between middle and high school I had a sudden increase in my mental state and stopped feeling completely hopeless about everything. The first part of my freshman year I got amazing grades and made a ton of new friends, and wanted to go to Stanford. 

The second half of the year I was under some stress from losing half my friends in some stupid drama and my grades dropped, but it still could have been worse. 

Sophomore year my grades continued to drop and I started having trouble focusing, especially in class. By the end of the year my grades were terrible, I'd lost most of my friends, was basically suicidal, and decided to leave the school because I thought I would be too lazy to handle the workload and because I thought that everyone hated me. 

My junior year has probably been the shittiest year of my life. I haven't made a single friend all year and I sit alone pretty much every day. My grades are worse than they've ever been. Throughout all of high-school my aspirations have gone from Stanford, to a less prestigious school, to maybe just an average in state school, to nothing, because I won't even be able to afford community college or get any scholarships with my terrible grades and lack of extra curricular activities. My mom doesn't even care what my grades are now and has just completely lost faith in me. 

It feels like my entire future has been thrown away, because literally nobody ever asked me if anything was wrong for 6 entire years. No matter how young I was or how out of character I was acting, nobody cared and everybody wanted to yell at me. 

I couldn't even ask to get help now because I'd never be allowed to. My dad would say mental illness doesn't exist and that it's just an excuse for ""the liberals"" to sell mind controlling addictive drugs that don't work. My mom would just yell at me and tell me I'd never be able to handle real life if I couldn't handle something as easy as school, because her (low stress) job is 1000x worse. The amount that I would get yelled at if I insisted I needed to wouldn't even make it worth it. 

It feels like both myself and my parents have completely failed me. I don't have a future with living, I don't have any hope of going to college like I thought I would for so long. I actually showed a lot of potential when I was younger and now I'll never be able to live up to any of it. ",01May2017,0
35,"My mom is an amazing person. She's funny, intelligent, kind, and understanding. A pretty good parent, seeing as I was an accident.
However, it's like sometimes she gets... replaced by someone else. A bitter human being who has no regard for anyone or anything in her path. Its like some days she wakes up and just hates me.

 Tells me horrible things about how ungrateful, selfish and inconsiderate I am, complains constantly about her life issues and makes me feel like they're my fault, swears and yells and makes me feel frankly like shit. 

I know she had a rough family life, but I didn't exactly have it easy either, with all the crazy stuff that's happened in my life- and yet she makes it sound like my life is easy, like I don't deserve anything I have, as if I should be guilty for my problems. 

Several times she's even gotten to the point of anger where she terrifies me- she starts speeding into traffic while cursing me, she locks me outside, she gets violent, and every time it's like the mom I know and love has been locked away somewhere.

 I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to make it sound like she's abusive because she's not, she just has episodes where it's like her temper turns her into a whole new person.

I suddenly had an experience that how come there is something and everything; how come we exist when there's nothing, no intelligence. Even if there's some intelligent being then how come they exist, how they came to be. 
I felt heat in my left hemisphere, I felt that if I don't this thought, this question let go I'll go insane. I even thought of leaving my parents a message that if I do go insane then just kill me.

38,"I am a US Army soldier currently deployed and I have been struggling for a while. I was raped multiple times a few months ago and I've been experiencing a lot of things that have been bothering me that I'm scared to talk about. 

I easily get startled. Someone was standing behind me in front of a mirror and I freaked out. I was sitting in a humvee in the middle of the night and I saw a silhouette, I ended up screaming and freaked the fuck out. Someone opened the door while I was in the humvee, I freaked out yet again.

I end up late out sitting in my car in a parking lot, alone with my thoughts and sit there for hours. I end up calling the Veterans Crisis Line with a blocked caller ID. I ended up getting tracked one time  by the person I spoke to and started freaking out that they would tell. Never heard from them ever again. The crisis center just made sure I would go home safely and call it a night.

A friend let me sleep over at his place a few days after the last incident, at first I was just laughing trying to make everything seem alright. When I just want to cry I try to laugh uncontrollably because I would rather laugh than cry. When I came over I couldn't sleep at my place and I was having a hard time even if I was given Percocet and a bunch of medications to fight off the pain and any risk of STD's. I finally fell asleep for a few hours and when I woke up I felt really sad and down, I couldn't speak a word for hours. My friend sat beside me the whole time trying to get me to talk, he would just tell me stories about random stuff. We didn't talk about the incident but he sat beside me and tried his very best to be there for me. He went out of the room to give me some alone time and I went out after a few minutes. He was watching cops and it was constantly showing people who just got sexually assaulted. I spoke for the first time screaming ""can we please fucking change the channel?"" He changed he channel asap. We went out after that. If he wasn't there I don't know what would've happened to me.

I wake up at night from a nightmare with my heart beating really fast, sweating. Usually the same dream. Every fucking time. It's been getting better gradually.

Every time I have to sit in a SHARP class, I try to pretend that it doesn't bother me and try to laugh along.

I usually find myself zoning out when something reminds me of the incidents. I feel like I'm reliving the moment again and I just end up staring at something for quite a bit. I eventually snap out of it and move on with my day.

Recently, I have been having the desire to smoke cigarettes again. I stopped wars ago because a person close to me died from lung cancer. I've been  desiring to drink as well but I can't drink while on deployment.

When authorities tracked me down again when they found out I went to the hospital late at night because I was raped yet again, when they speak to me I usually get nauseous but that morning it was the worst. I felt like throwing up and I thought I was going to faint. I felt like something was attacking me and I couldn't fight it off. I started crying and told them I just went to the hospital in the middle of the night to get a refill for my sleeping pills.

When I drive while I was in America, there were time I get really bad road rage. I got kind of scared with myself.

The perpetrator threatened to kill me if I tell anyone. I am not going to talk about what happened.

I have reported the incident but withheld some information from authorities. I've been checked out and been given medication. I've seen behavioral health but I feel like it was either pointless or I just didn't like the person I was speaking to.

I'm female, 26, US.

I've always been a very sexual person. I am very physically attracted to my boyfriend, I get off easily, and I'm just very sexual. 

I remember when I was little, I would get in trouble when I was caught ""rubbing"" against things. This continued to happen 7-9 when I did this.. eventually I got old enough, and understood masturbation, and began doing that even at a young age.

I never, EVER thought about it, and had completely forgotten about it pretty much, until today. But, I don't know what you would call it.. but when I was 7, one of the neighborhood kids, Alex, who was 13, would pull me aside when we all were playing and take me to his backyard into his sister's wooden playhouse, and we'd ""play doctor"".

He would take of my pants and shirt, and would touch me and look at me down there and on my chest too. 

He didn't ever have me touch him, but he always touched me. I remember I thought it felt good, so I would do things at home that made me feel those feelings.

I never recalled thinking it was wrong. 
We didn't do this for too long, because his family moved away shortly after he started doing this.

I wonder if this contributes to how sexual I am now, and why I enjoy masturbating so much?

I mean, now as an adult, thinking back on it, I can remember so many of the things he did to me. I feel sick to my stomach, and just feel weird about it. Like, I had completely forgotten about it until I was reading a reddit post about someone whose cousin ""played doctor"" with them when they were younger and it all came flooding back.

47,"I walked into another nightmare. The day felt leaden and dark, a day like the black days I’d seen before. Those countless days before. The cup of coffee I drank sparked some motivation and I used this to launch into my work, ignoring an old sensation creeping over me like a slow spill. Work filled the emptiness but in the back of  my mind the voices were mumbling. Not good enough. I focused on what I needed to do. Worthless. When my work was through the wave of despair hit like a tsunami. Isolated, alone, friendless, hapless, moron.
 
My body felt like a sandbag. I sat motionless, enduring the flood of negative thoughts, all the self-hate that ruled my mind for three decades had returned in a single day. I looked across the room at the time. It was now 2:00 pm. Did I take my meds? Guess not. I went for the familiar orange bottle, the big one, feeling a heaviness on me like a lead vest in the x-ray room. The anguish of sorrow and grief and loneliness weighed on me so deeply I knew that taking an anti-depressant at 2 pm wouldn’t do anything for me that day. Maybe I should go somewhere? Maybe I needed to get out? I did not know where.
 
I got a mile from my house and pulled off the road. I couldn’t go any further. The pain in me was just too much. The cars went slowly past as I sat there trying to figure out what I was doing, what I was going to do, where I was going. Everything seemed so meaningless. So bad. So cutting. I turned around and came back home.
 
It stinks to wake up feeling like I’m trapped in an Alice in Chains Song. The experience sent chills through me, not because of the despair itself but because that emotion followed so close behind me. I’d missed one, perhaps one and a half days. And the downward spiral was right there, following me like a shadow. The world snapped to black and everything distorted like it did before I sought help three years ago. Last Friday was like one day time travel back to 1992 or 2002 or 2012. It’s frightening how close those thoughts will follow me despite the years of therapy and medication and support groups and self care. It’s not over. It may never be over for me.
 
I could endure the pain knowing it wasn’t forever and I did so with the realization that I’d brought this upon myself. I wasn’t practicing self-care, the basics of doing what you need to do to be a functioning human being. Sometimes I feel guilty because from the outside self-care seems indulgent. Like I am loafing or something. But part of my self-care means being mindful of my medicine and taking it as regularly as I should. Other things I do are daily walks through the evergreens outside. Self-care is what keeps people like me alive. One or two days without being careful might lead me to my death and I want to get past that feeling of wanting to die.
 
I want to stay up all night to get lucky!
