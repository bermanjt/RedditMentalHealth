2,"Iâ€™m scared, every fiber of me is terrified. I've lost many people in my life. Friends, family. I had to deal with my own mortality at a young age. My parents are all I have. I am on disability, have no friends, am a social outcast, and deal with serious depression, and a whole array of other medical issues. 

Losing my parents, the thought of it, knowing its coming, inevitable, is more than I can bare. And the thought is constantly at the forefront of my mind. I think about it when I see the signs of my parents aging. White hair. The date. Everywhere I turn someone is saying something that reminds me of my own and my parents mortality. Most songs on the radio, nearly every TV show and movie, it's the one constant in everyone's life and it's everywhere.

Today I completely broke down. I told my Mom why I was having the panic attack and she dismissed it. As did my Dad. They don't understand. They tell me to think of something else. But I literally have nothing else in my life worth thinking about. Nothing to look forward to. No prospects. Nothing.

I don't know how to get past this. I don't know that I can. 

Help.

3,"I have been taking Seroquel XR for a few months now and it takes forever for me to wake up. I try running into the shower quickly, however even after showering I still go back to bed! And I can't drink coffee because I'm also on Wellbutrin XL and this medication and caffeine have a horrible horrible interaction. I also can't go on the regular Seroquel (I was on it before) because it does not calm down my mania enough. 
I also can't take the medication earlier in the evening because when I take it, I knock out in 30 minutes, and being in school I can't have myself sleeping at 8PM. 
I also do not want to go off the medication, since I have never been this stable in so many years. 

So I was wondering if anyone out there has any tips or tricks for waking up while on Seroquel XR or any way to take away the drowsiness in the morning please please let me know. Thanks for the help. ",31Mar2017,2
4,"Sometimes I wake up to take Sertraline and then go back to sleep for another few hours. After I wake up again, the medicine won't work in an hou, or won't work in 3 hours. 

If I take medicine and then go to work or somewhere, the effect and side effect medicine will kick in in an hour.

5,My BF doesn't like he's dad like that because he's been gone most of the time out he's life. So let's get to the story. He's dad came back a couple of months of ago then left again.my BF was like know need for him come back again. So he's mom calls him today and ask if he could take he's dad to fill out job applications. Then he just snap on he's mom saying he's gone beat her ass. I'm just like I can't let you beat your mom up. Trying make him calm down. Then he just decided to get a case of beer because he was mad. Then he was drinking them beers so fast black out. I guess it came back to him and he just snap. I had call 911 he want drive he's car but mom took he's keys and told him go to sleep. He listen to her and went to sleep.  But I already called the police. So the police show up and already know who he is. They want talk to him but he already went to sleep. The police said they were going just stay around the area to make sure he was ok. Should I worry about him really hitting he's mom? I tired to talk to he's mom but she was just crying so I just left her alone. He's bipolar and has serious anger issue ,31Mar2017,1
6,"I've tried googling it every which way, but nothing can really explain what I've been experiencing for the past 2 or 3 years. It's not like I'm experiencing the world like a dream, I get that too, but I know what that is. 

This is different. It's like, when I look around, I don't recognize where I am. I know that I know this place or these people, but I can't recognize it as a familiar sight or face. I know where I am, but it feels like it's not where I think I am. 

It kinda feels like I've walked into the wrong street that has all the same features as where I was, it's just not right. 

Idk, it's lead to a few panic attacks because of the confusion, and I just want an idea of what it is. ",01Apr2017,4
7,"I find myself getting very angry over things that have happened in the past or the stress involved with my present or uncertainty about my future. (I'm in the best situation I can be despite a bad one overall). Most emotions turn into anger pretty quickly. I cannot express anger in a healthy way but I can't just do nothing. So I break things, scream, slam doors, punch walls (until investing in a punching bag after an expensive repair job and hand the size of a basketball), throw things etc. Basically, I get physically violent and I've been lucky nobody has been in my firing line. But they almost have and it's scaring me because I tend to blank out a bit and become completely irrational during the episodes which end in crying for an hour or so. Has anybody else had this problem and how can I control or express my anger in a healthy way?

13,"I just experienced a night out (meeting at a bar downtown) with two of my girlfriend's college friends, all aged 23. They both exhibit textbook Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Easily the two most extreme cases I've encountered in my life. 

Needless to say it was a horrifying evening. Right now I feel as if my body has been bombarded with toxic energy. I feel physically ill.

What I'm in search of here are words of wisdom, experience, anecdotes, any sort of comfort you can offer if you've experienced these kinds of episodes before. I can get into specifics in replies but right now I'm in dire need of a virtual hug and some reassurance after hours of gas-lighting :(. Thank you in advance!!",01Apr2017,2
14,"Hey guys!:)

I've been on Lamotrogine since Nov 2015, and stayed at 100mg for the better part of a year. Now, she doubled that to 200mg and ever since, I can not wake up in the morning. 
I'm not great at taking them on a schedule, usually between 8pm-12am. Could this be affecting it?

Also, does anyone have hair loss with it? I've been losing my hair since early last year. ðŸ˜¶",01Apr2017,2
15,"Well this is gonna be a long story

It all started when I told a close friend that I liked her, but she didn't like me. The next day she revealed that she liked another friend of mine whom had told her he liked her many times, but before hand everyone those geht it was a joke. She told me that they were dating. 

The jealousy took over me, but since she was my close friend I told her about it. She was the most supportive and helpful person ever and helped so much on moving on, I later told the friend she was dating too and he even felt guilty for a bit because I was his friend. I knew that they are in love I am perfect fine with it, because
I'm happy that they are, I don't want to ruin their relationship because of me. This ended up making me trusting and respecting here more, and she had helped me with so many other problems that I don't know how to thank her, it brought us closer as friends and she is now my best friend.

But the thing is the jealousy is still there, and she has been trying her hardest to help me, and it has helped me a lot and I have gone a long way since then.

When they are kissing or doing things that couples do, the jealousy comes back even if I want them to be together. When it happens, the jealousy first comes over and I feel I'm dying inside of me, I try to distract myself and it works enough for me some times to forget about the jealousy and move on, but it sometime doesn't, then the guilt sets in. I used to bash myself for it and give myself a even lower self esteem, but she had helped me with that and it's mostly gone.

I have found that meditation stops the jealousy form coming up, and helps get rid of it after I feel jealous, but I want not feel jealous when I'm around them. I want to be happy for them and not feel depressed when I'm around them. I want to learn to accept that they like each other, that she doesn't like me and that I just need to move on and live my life. I just want to be happy with my friends.

I recently found out that she blames herself for hurting me, even though it is completely my fault for liking her in the first place. Me being in jealous is hurting her in return because she is running out of ideas to help me and I really don't want to hurt her because of my problems.",01Apr2017,1

19,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but unsure where to post. For obvious privacy reasons, I'm posting on a throwaway. 

My sister just texted me today saying she remembers some very strange things about my father that I know are untrue. She prefaced all this by promising to delete her messages after she sent them. After agreeing, she said she recalled repressed memories about his coaxing me to do cocaine at age 8, being a serial murderer, going to jail and needing to be bailed out by my aunt, etc. All of this is categorically untrue, and I was hoping it was an April Fool's joke. As many faults as he may have, he has been a loving father and worked hard to provide for our family while we were growing up. Besides, if any of that were true, he'd have failed every background check for the half dozen or so different jobs he held since then. Unfortunately, it is incredibly unlike her to pull a prank like that. 

Last I spoke to her, she said she was on her way to see a trauma therapist and I told her she should see a neurologist as well. I wasn't sure how to respond since to me it sounded like she was having a mental breakdown, and I was afraid any of my attempts at reason would exacerbate whatever was happening in her mind. I'm worried she could be suffering from depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, brain trauma, a brain growth, or something else I'm unaware of. She's 28, and I've seen schizophrenia at work before as one of my uncles suffers from it. She lives far from me (about 500+ miles), so it's not as easy as just driving out to her. 

Anyone here have advice on what else I should do? I'm currently waiting for her to call me after her appointment. I want her to get a CT scan, EKG, and even any other endocrinologic checks. ",01Apr2017,2

24,"I apologize if these kinds of posts are intended to be on a different subreddit, but I feel like this one would be helpful to ask any questions in. 

Essentially I'm wondering if anyone would know if I'm acting normally or if I should go see someone like a doctor or a psychiatrist.

I've been having very intense shifts in mental states, ranging from every few weeks to every few minutes. One state I'm often in is depression (from what I've read about it) where I would have incredibly low energy and self-esteem, I wouldn't find any joy in anything I usually love, and I feel really detached from everything. I feel like an observer to everything including myself. Although occasionally I would feel like myself, in fact maybe even too much like myself. Then I would randomly and without explanation go numb, stop feeling emotion, and detach from everything again. 

When I'm in a depressive state I'm often very irritable and prone to wanting to interact with the people I'm closest to constantly despite them not wanting to. I would overthink constantly and I would just hate myself more and more until I shifted states. I would resort to suicidal thoughts to calm myself down whenever something would happen (which is admittedly sort of ironic, but it works for me for some reason).

When I'm in the more emotionless state I would act more normally, I wouldn't be as clingy nor would I overthink or even think negatively about myself. Granted, I would perceive myself as an average human with nothing *too* special about him/myself. During this state I would have a lot more energy, in fact so much that I would constantly be fidgeting and I would have a lot of muscle spasms in my arms and neck.

Everything I just explained has been what's happening regularly for around a year, but for the past 2-3 weeks I've been shifting states very regularly (every few days at max, and even every 10 or 20 minutes. This isn't including normal mood swings that I have depending on the situation) and I've had no appetite for anything. I've lost weight and I've become more pale and dead-looking, plus the dark circles under my eyes have intensified. I've recently noticed myself wanting to sleep more since I can't bear being awake and feeling so horrible, so I would go to bed 3-4 hours earlier than I usually do. (AKA going to sleep at around 11 PM when I'd usually go to bed at roughly 2, 3, or even 4 AM.) I've been forcing myself to eat so I don't become too malnourished. This has all been accompanied by myself changing personalities without knowing it. Close friends of mine have stated that I act like different people depending on the day.

Any thoughts on what might be going on or what I might have?
I've heard people say that I have bipolar disorder, depersonalization-derealization disorder, major depression, borderline-personality disorder, and dissociative identity disorder.

27,"I can't trust myself. I'm starting to hate being told secrets but I also can't live without them. Each day I wake up and think about who I will have to talk to and what I can and can't say. Each day I wake up dreading having a conversation to someone, I constantly look around to see if people are looking at me. Each laugh each whisper, is it about me? When I meet up with friends I feel as if they are talking about me all the time. I'll say things to get them to change topic, I say things I shouldn't and then i regret it. I say things which ruins friendships and damages trust. I guess it's all starting to catch up with me now though. No longer damaging other people's relationships but also damaging mine. People know not to trust me, yet the people who still try to be friends with me are the people who I hurt the most. Even they are starting to give up on me, even they are now realising that I'm a poison not to be around and at some point I'll hurt them no matter how hard I try (even if it seems I'm not trying at all). No one quite knows what makes me click what causes me to lose my shit, yet everyone can see I am not the person I try to come across as, I'm hiding something yet even I don't know what. I use to help people's issues, now I just cause them, saying things that are not true just to take the attention of me. I guess when the school starts to think I have anxiety it might be true. I am finally starting to crack, each comment about around me pulls a little piece of my armour away even if it's not about me but how would I know there all laughing, maybe it is about me. I could say I'm sorry for what I say, for how I test people's friendships but what would be the point I find it fun to see what comes out the mess. Yet maybe at some point I'll see what I'm actually doing and see how badly I am effecting people yet I just can't I enjoy what I do. I know it's not right and I know I am slowly making choices which means I am loosing any trust anyone has in me but maybe that is for the best. 

I know this is not normal and I just wondered why I would feel like this, I'm 16 and male for other info.",01Apr2017,2
