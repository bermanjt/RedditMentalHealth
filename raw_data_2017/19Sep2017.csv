0,"I'm a psych nurse from Australia, currently working in a 15 bedded acute mental health ward. I'm very fortunate to work alongside an extremely empathic, kind and supportive team, where our focus is making sure our patients have the most therapeutic experience as possible. We generally get very positive feedback from patients, to the point where, if it comes to readmission, they elect to come back to us, even if they are out of area. I think a lot of it has to do with only being a small unit, meaning that we develop sincere connections with the people we nurse... this often means we can de-escalate verbally if a situation arises, rather than resort to medication straight away, which I think is much more therapeutic.

I've been following this thread for a while now, and I'm heartbroken to read how many people have had traumatic inpatient experiences. I understand that being locked up against your will would be traumatic for basically any of us, but it's so disheartening and horrifying to read about some of the conditions, and how the staff sometimes make an inpatient stay much much worse. 

Hence the reason for this post... has anyone come out of an inpatient stay being grateful for their time there? I'm interested to hear all kinds of perspectives. :)",19Sep2017,11

2,"We broke up like 2 years ago but have stayed as friends. It was a long distance relationship. But now I live closer to her and for some reason I just can't get over her even though I know she is basically over me. Heck, even if she wasn't over me, I know a relationship between us wouldn't have worked out because we have too many differences in personal preferences... and I am not talking about preferring different pizza toppings. 

So she has been developing a crush on a guy who is currently engaged, and sure enough I am the one who is trying to comfort her. The problem is that it comes across as me being jealous and controlling when I tell her it's probably a bad idea for her to continue to hangout with him. This has caused a big strain on our friendship. I don't know what to do. I want to be supportive but my actions and not being able to get over her is making me absolutely miserable. I can't even make it through a day without breaking down over it",19Sep2017,2
3,"I am a little lost. I'm 27. Ive been in and out of college for 9 years. When i started i was extremely sick and for the first 4-5 years of college i was in hospitals. I stopped for awhile, because i was still sick out of the hospital. For the longest time I wasn't med compliant and had serious issues. I almost got put in jail. Got back into it 2 years ago, this time online. Been kind of doing well, overall, not just in college but in life. Still have major hiccups from time to time, episodes I mean. But, i'm wanting to continue my whole bachelors online. I tried going to a 4 year university in person, and it was extremely hard. Not because of the academics (I consider myself pretty smart), but because of the commute. I was commuting in the morning for 3 hours a day, everyday. I had to stop going to that particular university. It's the medication. They make me extremely tired all day, everyday, and the commute seemed impossible. I really wanted this, because I love school. 

Now im wanting to continue my degree online in my major of choice. But, ive only found one school that has it. Arizona State University. Well...I live in Texas. I'm worried people will see that and think harshly of me, because it will be obvious it's an online degree. It's my last resort now though, since the meds are working to hold back most of my episodes, but make me too tired to actually go in person and focus.

Not sure what I should do. Should I pursue a degree there due to meds? I wasn't sure where to put this, but I feel this subreddit is appropriate.",19Sep2017,10

8,"Okay, apparently getting your PhD is supposed to give you anxiety. I'm a first year in a great program. I have a lot of support (unlike some): a great family, friends, and a mentor. Unfortunately, for most of my life up until now I've been the ""happy sunshine rainbow"" girl. I smiled, made everyone feel better. I used to sing in the shower. Throughout my undergrad and masters career, I'd known stress. Sure, healthy stress. But what I'm experiencing now... it's not stress. My head hurts all the time, I'm pulling back the skin around my fingers until it bleeds, I'm crying constantly, I find myself counting all the time, especially when driving, to help calm myself down. When I leave one of my classes (which are at night), I cry from my building to my car, and then have to try to calm down before I can drive. My mood, which as I said was happy, joyful, hopeful, has diminished. I try to keep being happy fun sunshine, but I can't. I told my SO, I keep telling him my thoughts my problems, but I can tell he a) doesn't care or b) doesn't want to deal with it. We're long distance. I don't blame him. The last time he saw me I was happy. Excited to start a new PhD program. The way this makes me feel, the way I'm falling apart, I feel like I've failed everyone. I failed my parents because they worked hard to give me everything I ever needed. I failed my mentor, who wrote me glowing letters of recommendation and now I feel like I'm smearing her name in the mud. And I feel like I have failed my SO, since I left him behind in another state to try and achieve a PhD. I'm not suicidal. I wouldn't kill myself. I wouldn't want to intentionally hurt anyone by ending my life. I guess.. long story short, I used to sing in the shower and smile when I had my polka dot umbrella out in the rain. And now I don't sing. I don't smile. And I push everything deep inside and pretend to be a happy sunshine girl.

However, if I feel a bump (mosquito bite, pimple, ingrown hair...) on my skin, I most likely start scratching it, sometimes a bit too much.

That includes scabs. If I have a part I scratched before and it made a scab, there's a very good chance I'll keep scratching that one until I don't feel the bump anymore, which causes bleeding, which causes a scab...

Behind my head, hidden by hair, I have a little bump I've been picking at for several years now, everytime picking the scab and repeating every now and again.

10,"Hi everyone, I’m almost 3 weeks into school now, and I’m having troubles in my English class. A lot of which we’re talking about or doing in class is talking about our feelings on certain subjects, most of which involves placing ourselves in the shoes of the author/character/person to have an understanding, and how we reflect or react to it.

I’m having problems with this, especially when we have to be placed in groups to talk with our classmates about it, because my contribution to the group or my thoughts on the subject is nothing, or it’s just completely weird. I can’t feel what the author/character wants us to understand. My teacher showed us a picture that supposed to make us feel anger or something emotional, but I couldn’t help but laugh when I first saw it. I still couldn’t get how people felt the way they did or have thoughts regarding it. I only understand it’s seriousness because the class described their feelings towards it and the teacher admitting that it’s supposed to make you feel angry or emotional. I only think it’s bad when everyone else thinks so because I can’t seem to grab the connection myself. And it’s not like I don’t wanna feel what they’re feeling, I just don’t feel it. I think I lack empathy, and I don’t know what it feels to have one.

I feel embarrassed and stupid when I can’t describe to my partners my opinion of this person were supposed to understand, I just don’t get it. And when I do, my partners give me an odd expression. I feel hopeless right now, I feel like I’m gonna fail when it comes down to exams and essays. I’m not sure if English is subjective.

I thought it was strange so I wanted to have a closer look but while I was adjusting the paper in my hand to look at it, it fell off the paper and presumably to the floor. I freaked out and used my phone torch to try and locate the piece of poop to clean it up, however much to my horror, I couldn't find it, I searched very very well but could not find it anywhere. My question is, if somehow a small piece of poop ended up on my body somehow do you think other people would be able to smell it?

Now, a few weeks ago, he came up with this new theory that the only reason my husband forced him to do football and go to competitions is becauase I did not have sex with him because my husband was not hot and this somehow provoked repressed frustration in my husband which caused him to terrorize the son to make my husband feel more masculine. He says I emasculated him by refusing sex. I think my husband mentioned to him the lack of sex between us when he was drunk once. I am in shock.

I don't know what I have. I'm too scared to talk to anyone about it. The one person/friend (who has talked about their mental problems) I did talk to it about told me that I don't understand it and I am self diagnosing myself. I was not. I only talked about what I may have or possibilities of what it may be. I don't have the confidence to talk to anyone about it.

I can't tell what I have. I seem to constantly change from believing I have something wrong to thinking that I am am idiot for believing myself. I can't convince myself that I have problems yet I am almost certain I do. I think I hallucinate and I become detached from reality. I play games to destruct myself so it doesn't happen often. When I sleep I hear things and feel and think terrible things.

I hate reality, and can't tell what's real yet I can. I don't know

30,"So several years ago I suffered from severe depression. I won't go into details here, I posted that story a while back (https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/6v9zoy/introductionmy_storyim_here/).

Since then, I'm about as recovered as I can ever hope to be. Obviously there's ups and downs, but generally i'm in a good place, and when things get bad I don't spiral anymore.

However, since that time, when I pretty much became cut off with the world, I find social situations incredibly hard. I'm absolutely fine with my friends, who I know and love and everything just feels natural.

The lingering problem, which I can't get away from, is that when meeting new people, or spending time with people I don't know that well (including colleagues, friends of friends etc) I find it so hard to make conversation. I go to a few conferences for my PhD, where most people don't know anyone else. Every time I find myself sat on my own with no one to talk to. When I do get introduced to someone, or somehow a conversation begins, I can't keep it going. The last one I attended, at a conference of 200 people, by day 3 I found myself dreading lunch/breaks, because while everyone was talking to each other, I didn't know what to do. I can honestly say I haven't made a new friend in about 4 years.

This never used to be a problem, people used to see me as the guy who could talk to anyone, would get me to start conversations for them. I never had any issues meeting people or socialising whatsoever.

I know I am the problem, not everyone else. I know it is probably a confidence thing. But I don't know what I can do to become less socially anxious. It feels like the problem is getting worse and worse. I'm 25, and as friends drift to far flung places for work etc, I'm concerned that I wont be able to make new friends, or that I won't do well in future jobs, because I won't be the guy anyone wants to promote. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this?
Has anyone found any effective methods for overcoming this?

Thanks a lot!

34,"So I've been going therapy for I think 5 sessions now.  I only procrastinated my entire adult life (I am almost 30 now and have struggled with ADD, anxiety and mild but very persistent depression since about age 9.)  I went to therapy as a child for severe school refusal, but it was never really effective because I was too embarrassed to be honest about my anxiety, so it was typically just a lecture session about why I should go to school.

Anyway, getting to the point.  I feel like I'm not telling my therapist whatever it is that she needs to know to help me.  We have been doing a very relaxed version of CBT, and I have been trying to notice the thoughts going through my head before I do things, but sometimes I feel like there really are no thoughts ... I just do things.  Or sometimes there may be flashes of thoughts (for example, when I don't get out of bed on time, I might think something like ""I can sleep for another half hour."")  But I feel like there is a whole lot more going on in my head than the short verbal thoughts.

Basically, even though I do have a ton of verbal thoughts, I think that I do a lot of my thinking without words.  Especially during times when I'm doing things I shouldn't do, or not doing things I should do.  When I told my therapist this, she said ""It seems to me like you are very experiential.""  So now she does a lot of visualization type exercises with me.  For example, she'll ask me to close my eyes and picture the way that I was feeling at a certain time, where in my body I felt anxiety, etc.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure that this is helping me much either.  Mostly, I just tense up because the exercise itself makes me extremely anxious, even though it's all about relaxation.

Now, I had Maladaptive Daydreaming since I knew myself. I never really had too close friends because I usually ended up having imaginary friends when none of my friends had it. I also had a pretty large imagination world (or I thought so). So long story short I had this severely since I was little.
 I am  quite talented in art (especially drawing), so I try to make my daydream characters more... real. Which leads me to get very creative at daydreaming and drawing while I am at school and supposed to be focused in my lessons. I noticed it made me dissociated with reality so I realized I don't enjoy things most people would die for. I realized this one when I had an extremely vivid night dream. Now to think about it, in my night dreams I never daydream, I get the most intense emotions ever, and I don't care who I am at all, I actually had fun being present more than I get happy from my daydreams. I don't like my life to be in the control of me, which happens when I daydream. I realized I can never get creative enough while I do it. But when life is an exciting adventure with people to talk with, it is just very enjoyable and I am less awkward like that. 
I was always a very slow and silent person. And I am too nice to people. I can't hate or get angry at people. If I try not to be too nice, I appear to be edgy/tryhard just like I seem like in this post. I
 know I wrote a wall of text here, but I don't really care now. You can just get to my questions if you want.

44,"I killed a kid once.

I don’t remember exactly how old he was, be he couldn’t have been more than 14 years old. Maybe slightly older, maybe slightly younger. Honestly, it’s all a blur to me.

I don’t know how to describe him. Stupid or slow might be my best way to describe him, though if he was alive today, I think he would have described himself as “innocent”. It’s bullshit though. If you touch a stove once, and get burned, it’s a learning experience. The second time you touch the stove, it’s already a little iffy. But the third time you touch that damn stove and get burned, you aren’t innocent, you’re just plain stupid. That’s how he was with people. He didn’t see the evil in them, even when they proved time and time again, that they wanted him no good. And with time, people realized that someone like that can be taken advantage off. Even then, he never learned his lesson. He got mad at them, of course, but it always faded, at the first sign or an apology. I wonder how many half-baked apologies he accepted, not even considering how they were obviously just waiting for another opportunity to abuse his goodwill.

He didn’t have many friends. Although he was very nice to people, there’s just very few that wants to hang out with the kid that gets bullied. He usually hung out with the other “outcasts”. The emo’s and the goth’s, anyone that would tolerate him. Most of the time he didn’t really enjoy being with them, but it was better than sitting alone.

I know I said that I killed that boy, but I don’t think the rest of the world sees it that way. I still believe with every fiber in my body, that I killed him, but perhaps it would be more fitting to say that I changed him.

After finishing Junior high and dropping out of school to pursue a career with one of his few skills, he thought that he would finally be free of bullying. Outside of school people would be adult enough to be nice towards each other, or at least leave each other alone, if they didn’t like each other. I told you he was stupid.

It took a few years, but one day I woke up, and realized that I had nothing in common with the boy who used to be. I’d finally started learning my lessons, probably a little too late. Maybe if I’d learned from them when I was still a child, I might have adapted better, but I didn’t.

I don’t have much feeling left in me anymore, I simply just stopped caring, like everyone around me. No one’s ever going to get away with bullying me again, but I’m also afraid to let people in close. It’s strange to put it on paper, but it’s the truth. Every time I’ve let someone close to me, it’s backfired. Not all of them wanted to hurt me, of course, but their good intentions doesn’t do much about the pain from that knife that’s stuck in my back.

When I finally do feel something, it’s usually remorse for what happened to that boy who used to live in this body, or fear, that whatever’s left of me, will die as I live, alone. Anger is a good feeling too. Not that I enjoy being angry, but it fuels me. I have to get up every morning, to show those assholes out there that they haven’t gotten me yet. If I weren’t so angry, I think I would have died long ago.

Is there a point to all of this?

I’m not sure, to be honest.

No one’s going to come and save you, no matter how much you need it or ask for it. Your parents won’t save you, your teaches don’t give a damn, and your friends will probably turn on you if someone else can offer them something interesting enough.

Finally, I have a favor to ask of you. If you come across one of those assholes in your life. Bitter and angry, and not above mocking everyone and everything. The type to throw out some smartass comment no matter if someone stubbed a toe or someone got murdered. Then please keep in mind, that even though they’re probably not redeemable anymore, one upon a time, there was a good person in there, and nobody cared.

Anti-Depressants work for a bit then wear off usually, or rather they never seem to work. Just realized, im Bipolar more than anything, cycling through highs and lows my whole life. The lows suck but the highs are what really hurts you. Is some of that cycling something EVERYONE goes through? Are our highs and lows just more extreme? I could swear I just had anxiety and depression, but I don't really see the difference between that and Bipolar (im type 2). I did have a while there when I switched meds, I would get extremely angry while driving, and also was not suicidal but in that area. Doc is taking me off my 20mg citalopram (used for depression, generic of Celexa)and putting me on 100mg of Seroquel (Quetiapine). Not sure what to expect, I just want these highs and lows to go away. I mean, everyone loves their highs. But ive gotten to the point where I am smart enough and seasoned enough in this that, the highs are bittersweet. I know exactly whats going to follow these highs, and the low feelings will be exacerbated by whatever frivolous spending/acting I do while im in my high mode. Is being bipolar something you can easily define? Maybe I just have some symptoms but am not Bipolar, or I cam Bipolar, i just dont know. ",20Sep2017,1

48,"I've always been troubled, and when I was younger I started seeing a psychologist. Mental health disorders rum in my family. I was diagnosed with some anxiety disorder and presecribed some pills to help it, but they never did, and eventually I just stopped going. I'm 18 now and for a while have just dealt with all of my issues. I was taking a psychology class, and I realized I don't think all I have is anxiety. I perfectly match all the descriptions of BPD, but I'm afraid to seek help, because I'm a man and I know it isn't common on men, and I'm afraid of bring misdiagnosed and spending money getting treatment that doesn't help me. What should I do? Is there some way to directly approach this? Thank you for any information you may have.",20Sep2017,1

50,"Has anyone experienced hallucinations on Lexapro? If so, did you have a past history of hallucinations?

I haven't had a hallucination in almost a year, and seemingly out of the blue, I had an auditory hallucination. I don't know why else it could've happened because it was the same thing as my past hallucinations.",20Sep2017,1
