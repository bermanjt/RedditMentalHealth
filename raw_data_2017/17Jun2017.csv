0,"I have a lot of different confusing issues rn but for some reason I won't let myself think about them. When ever I'm like okay I need to figure out what's going on I can't sort through my thoughts it's like I force myself into auto pilot or into a zoned out kinda thing. I feel like I go through most of the day with out actually thinking about anything that really matters or that I really need to work through. I know this probably feels different to everyone but it's sort of a feeling I've gotten before when high, like my mind can just blank and I stare at the wall or I stare at my phone and scroll through social media but not pay attention like I'm not really there. I don't even know how to say any of this and it probably doesn't make sense",17Jun2017,1
1,"I have what I would call a heart of stone have a hard time feeling and expressing love even to family. I am almost certain that love depresses me. To extend this if I see a loving couple on the street, I tend to get depressed and my day is usually ruined from then on. It doesn't just have to be a real couple it could be in a movie or some barely friend on social media. For some background, I am a male that has never so much as held hands with a girl, and I feel like I won't be able ever to do so I'm am not sure why I believe this but I can't get over the feeling. So my question is could this be depression and loneliness or is it something more?",17Jun2017,1
2,"Every time I start a goal I have a voice in my head telling me that I am stupid or that what I am doing is meaningless. For instance, I have started doing stained glass and have a goal that if I can get good enough maybe I can sell some.  The voice tells me that I am being a narcissist.  Stained glass is only art, no one really appreciates it and no one really cares about it.  I used to really love writing and magic, but with the writing the voice tells me I am a horrible writer, and that all the good stories have already been told and  no one really wants to read.   And with the magic it is you will never be as good as your dad so why bother.   Whenever I screw up or stumble I just start obsessing that I  am stupid.   Does this sound like narcissism?  There are other things I obsess over too, like climate change, bigotry, the meaning of life, death, fear of robots and no one having health care. ",17Jun2017,2

5,"So one passtime I thoroughly enjoy is DND, Dungeons and Dragons. And in my game, I am the Dungeon Master. For those who don't know, I run the entire game for 6 players. 

So recently​ I've been hit with a particularly hard depression that's just kinda been in the background of everything. And I'm fairly certain I've been developing some form of anxiety. 

Well my group plays every Saturday night. But lately, the past month or two, I've been almost dreading playing. Which is odd. I've always enjoyed using character voices and sound effects, all that. But those seem to be getting more and more difficult. Not to mention the fact that I love to DM. 

I just wanted to know if this is normal or if it has a name. I don't want whatever the fuck my brain is doing to get worse, as I've got enough going on up there anyway. 

Thanks",17Jun2017,2
6,"I'm an 18 year old female and I have mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, emetophobia, chronic insomnia, and psychosis. This has lead to physical health problems such as POSSIBLE epilepsy, migraines, GERD, IBS, and dyspepsia. I can't get a paid job due to my health but I volunteer at a couple places 2-3 times a week. Whenever I feel unwell I retire to my room to try and distract myself and just ride it out but my parents (especially dad) will always tell me to get up and do stuff like housework or exercise. Sometimes I'm in a state where I just can't and I wish they'd understand that. My mum used to be an occupational therapist and my dad studied psychology in the 80s and is now working in disability. They think they know more about what's right for me and it was okay at the start but I've had these things since I was 12 and now I know what's best for me.

7,"Within less than a year I have moved in with another family member from a bad situation, gained a support system that I had never had prior,gotten my license, graduated from a 2-year college, started a part-time job, gotten accepted to a four-year university, and recently lost my father to suicide. I have so many different emotions it is unbelievable. My father's suicide has left me feeling odd and depressed. I try my best to block it out and focus my attention on other things, when in reality I am still grieving his loss. It also makes it difficult because I did not have the best relationship with him before he passed. I'm also really nervous about going off to a university in the fall. I'm afraid of not pushing myself out of my comfort zone, as I am extremely  introverted, quiet, and have trouble making friends that get me. As of right now I can name only one person who I truly consider a friend and not an acquaintance. I have trouble in general with having relationships both non romantic, and romantic. I have one friend and have never had a boyfriend. I fear that I have too many emotional issues to have someone get to know me that deeply.I have also gained a great support system, two of my family members, who have helped me tremendouasly mentally and financially. I just found out that they are seriously considering moving back to where they lived originally because of a huge job opportunity. The problem is that it is 5  hours away from the university I will be attending. I wouldnt be able to go hpme on weekends, and if something happened I wouldnt have anyone that could help me. I would also see them wayyy less because it would take more time to get to one another. I feel like Im being kind of selfish in not wanting them to leave because of how I feel and things I'm going through, but would feel like I just lost the only support system I've ever had if they leave. Sorry if this is too long, but any advice would be gladly appreciated.

10,"Over the course of my 11 year relationship it has become apparent that I am extremely emotionally selfish. As an example, I used to cause relationship problems for the emotional catharsis because I didn't know how to process my feelings in a healthy way. We have discussed this in couples counseling and I don't go to this extreme anymore, but I am left to wonder if at the core, it's because I know I can't get away with it and not because I have actually changed my ways. 

I still very much struggle with my emotions. Lately I go through periods where I make any sort of mistake and it leads to me feeling anxious over the possibility of causing an issue in the relationship, which then leads me to spiral downward and cause an issue in the relationship. The more I fail the worse it becomes. I don't know how to break the cycle. 

I also don't know how to support my SO after I've hurt him, because I am caught up in my own guilt and pity party. I have such an inability to determine what he needs from me, and even when he tells me I will often disregard it because I'm so hung up on what I need to do to feel better. After a conflict that I've caused, I try to feel better by doing nice things for him (not for his sake, but because it helps me feel like a better person) or talking about my feelings when he is the injured party. 

My SO knows this about me and has for some time, but after this long of the same pattern he says this is now an issue I have to work out on my own. I'm at a loss. The dissonance of loving someone and yet having them constantly come second to myself is weighing me down. 

Thank you for reading. Any thoughts or advice is greatly appreciated.

13,"I'm an introvert male, 21 yrs. old. I don't usually speak much, I have almost no friends, and zero true friends. I despise people instinctively, yet I tolerate strangers. 

When someone opens up to me, I feel more and more confortable to release what's inside me, both good and bad things. Eventually I feel no remorse in letting people know how much they disgust me, even tho they've been kind and friendly, and start to subtly point out and state things otherwise I would be ashamed to even mutter about a completely stranger. Then a burst of blind rage comes out, and that's when I say the most horrible things. At first that rage is anesthetic, then It hurts me when I realize how bad I treated someone.
It seems I punish people for trying to be close to me, my wicked mind thinks everyone dislikes me, and I think that's what makes me to dislike them back. It's like an injured animal attacking a helping person out of shock.

14,"Obviously there is no way of you knowing for certain just based on this post but i do want to see what the general opinion is, I'll explain. I recently had a rather jarring experience where someone called me crazy, they didn't mean as an insult and were completely legitimately concerned. I do have a history of mental health issues in my family but have never considered this before as I was always somewhat distant from them. I tend to go through mood swings ranging from from euphoria to suicidal thoughts and generally feeling the world is meaningless. During this time I also have a tendency towards paranoia particularly paranoia that everything we think about the world is an illusion. I also during my euphoria will sometimes think that I might be the second coming of Christ, or even god himself.

16,"I don't wanna say I'm depressed. I still enjoy being around friends and interacting with other people but I'm never happy. Growing up, my parents taught me that I had to succeed and always prepare myself for the future.

I'm always tired and don't wanna do the applications but I know I need to in order to have a good life. Or at least, I was taught that. I talk to my parents about it and they say they support me in whatever I do but I know that the second I start slipping, they'll start bombarding me and telling me to focus on my future.

I just wanna be happy. Nothing is ever enough to me and I feel like this is the conditioning from my parents or me just having too high expectations for myself. The company I intern at is never enough or I won't get into my dream school are all thoughts that rush through my mind.

I just want to be able to sit down, relax, and smile and tell myself that I am where I need to be in life at that time. But I can't. I don't know what to do.

18,"I have no clue what to title this post. I have been having some problems with the way I've been feeling. 
Just some background: I have diagnosed BPD, Major Depression, PTSD, Social/Generalized Anxiety and I also sometimes have auditory hallucinations.
So, I work overnights. I have worked overnights before, and it wasn't really a problem like it is now. I have a wonderful man who is super supportive and helps anyway he can - truly a blessing. I feel like I'm letting him and everybody I know down by not being able to control myself when it comes to my mood swings, which are very frequent and sometimes can be intense. 
The reason I'm even making this post is because I'm dissociating. I'm losing grip of reality.
Lately I have been extremely depressed and overly anxious. I feel like I'm putting a lot of pressure on my boyfriend, which makes me feel bad, which in turn makes me more depressed and anxious. Tonight, my brain decided to put me in a sort of safe mode, I guess. 
I feel like I'm just going through the motions, not consciously doing anything. My muscle memory is getting me through the physical part, while my brain just shuts off and thinks about nothing. 
I wish there was a way for me to feel better... Or at least not feel like I'm a burden to my boyfriend. That really is the thing that bothers me the most. I want to be enough for him. I want to have him never worry about how I'm doing because I want to be better. I just don't see myself progressing in the near future.. I have had numourous hospital visits, medication changes, times where I got off my medication, behavioral therapy, DBT workbooks (because I hate going to see a shrink.) 
I just am at a loss. 

I feel like I'm just an absolute waste of a person. When my mood changes, which it does very quickly, I say things and do things that I wouldn't normally do. I'm a different person. I say hurtful things that I can't take back. 
I know that mental illnesses can be damaging to relationships. I've been abandoned by literally everybody that I've invited into my life. I don't feel worthy of anybody's love. Especially the man's I'm with now. Everything I do seems to turn out wrong. 
I have no friends. I just sit and work and do nothing. I often daydream about hurting myself. Ways to make it all just end. Sometimes it scares me how totally possible the ways are. Thinking about dying calms me down, and then I get sad that I'm still sitting here in this fucked up world that we've all made for ourselves. 
Why can't I just be normal. Why can't I just control my mood swings. Why can't I just do the right things.

I really feel like going to the hospital might be a good thing for me. I just really am afraid that I'd fuck everything up out in the real world. So what would be the point of going to get help when you'd come back to a mess that would land you right back in the ward... 
I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Idk what the responsible thing to do would be.

24,"Sorry if this is to;dr. I'm just so frustrated with my partner and not sure what to do. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice or possible diagnosis for this. My partner- male, middle aged- never seems to be content with anything. We have been together for 5 years and friends for 10, and while I did notice it here and there in the past, I never noticed how strongly it affects our lives before. 

A few examples... we recently signed a year long lease on a beautiful new home so we could save up money to buy our own home. We spent a lot of time looking for the perfect house for our budget... and the second we found one and signed the lease, he immediately started looking for the next house. We haven't even moved in to the rental yet! He sends me texts with addresses of *gems* he's found. I've questioned him before- why are you even looking right now?? That house will be gone in a week! And he says he just wants to get a feel for the area and the market. He even goes to open houses on his lunch break! He also says we could just ""break our lease"" if a really great house came alone... completely neglecting the fact that we're renting to SAVE money for the downpayment. 

Another example... we are buying furniture for the new house. We have a beautiful dining set that we have owned for the past 2 years that is in our current rental house. He thinks we should just buy a new one and sell the old one. Why?? There isn't an issue of moving it- we hired movers. And we love our dining set! He said ""just a thought, you don't have to be so negative."" Am I though? All I said was ""why would we need a new one when we have a perfectly wonderful one right here."" And even if I was being negative... It's hard to not be when things like this keep popping up. (The table is just ONE example of this very same issue. Replace table with most common furtnitre items. Bed, desk, dresser, BBQ grill... all things that are in absolutely perfect condition and practically brand new.)

Another example. We recently got a dog because our new home has a spacious backyard and we have always wanted a dog. He's apparently been looking around for a second dog. We've never even discussed getting a second dog. Ever. We've always just wanted ""a dog."" Not multiple dogs. Or other animals... just... ""a dog.""

It just seems like he can never sit still and just sit back and enjoy life. He's always looking for the next big thing. He has a job, he has hobbies (though maybe he needs more?) I just don't understand this. I was hoping that after 3 months of absolute hell of trying to find the perfect home for us within our budget that we could sit down with the dog we've always wanted and relax! And he is more like, okay- now that's out of the way, I need a new thing to focus on! He assures me that he is very happy with our life. Nothing is lacking for us romantically, physically, spiritually... like it's not as if we always wanted a child and suddenly were told we couldn't have one. And thinking back, he really always has been like this- the type who can't sit still and relax on a weekend and needs to just be out of the house or doing some sort of a chore- it's just really ramped up lately. Or maybe I'm just noticing it more this week because we have been so focused on finding this house that he hasn't had time to be fidgety. 

And not to mention, a lot of his desires cost money! Money that we should be saving for our home purchase and retirement. 

Of course, I have tried talking to him. He does a very good job of gaslighting. He turns it around and makes it an issue that I have or something about how I'm risk averse and resistant to change- which is true, but it doesn't make for a very easy conversation. We have had some couples therapy but this issue was never really resolved because he flat out refuses to admit he has any sort of problem. And maybe he doesn't! But the problem or non problem is driving me insane. It's gotten to the point lately where I don't like spending too much alone time with him because every time he opens his mouth, i tense up like he's about to say ""hey, I was just thinking... we should buy a boat! And since we will have a boat, I'll need to buy a truck to haul it... and when we're not using it, we can rent it out!!"" It takes every bit of strength for me to just nod my head and said ""yeah that could be cool."" Because if I ever react negatively... according to him... I'm being a jerk for not listening to this thing he's apparently been doing secret research on for weeks. With me, I don't know... I feel like all someone would have to say is ""Seriously?? Relax! We should be setting aside money for buying a house, which we should start looking at in about 8 months... and we should take some time to get to know our puppy before we jump into full time double dog ownership!"" And I'd snap right out of it and be like ""of course! I was being silly!!"" But he gets so bent out of shape and a lot of times, it ends up being a fight because I try to backtrack and be supportive without giving in... and it just never works.

25,"Starting with my mother, I have felt completely disconnected from everyone in my life. I don't feel love or compliments or positive regard from anyone, though I am quite sensitive to criticism and rejection. I get very pissed off when somewhat annoyed at the drop of a hat, but I very really feel any other emotion. The only person I was ever deeply attached to was my only serious ex gf, who was very beautiful, intelligent, and down to have sex literally whenever (and sometimes wherever), so there was a lot of lust involved (also considering I lost my virginity to her). Other girlfriends before her meant nothing to me and I dumped them over text. It's so bad that when my mother died when I was 6, I was only delighted to have a week off from school and in no way bummed out by her passing. In fact, I hardly thought of her. When my friend disappeared in 4th grade, I quickly dug through his stuff and asked if I could have them since he wouldn't need them wherever he was (I believe in an orphanage). 

That said, I also have had slight delusions since I about 10 or 11. These are definitely different from just childhood imagination. First, I remember believing I was God or a god and had psychokinetic powers. Then at about 12, I suddenly stopped what I was doing in a playground and had an idea pop into my head that I was a fallen angel reincarnated in human form. These passed for a few years (that I remember) until I started doing more psychedelics and was in the later stages of my relationship with my serious ex (a few months in) in my first semester of college. It started with just a belief that she was cheating on me or undressing people with her eyes. 

This passed and after I dumped her out of fear she was going to leave me or cheat on me, I wasn't really delusional for another several months until I stopped going to classes and started writing an actually really bad novel believing I was going to be the next big thing in literature. I shut myself in my room for a while in the process and started getting scared at shadows more and more. Then, I took a big LSD/pot brownie trip that sent me into a hellish spiral. After it ended I believed my dealer was an ISIS agent sent to brainwash me, or a part of some massive conspiracy to get me to change my course in life. Then, I started believing the world was ending that very day after I took the LSD, and drove home. A train blocked my way and I thought I missed the boat to spend the last moments with my family before the rapture. Well, the train of course passed but a thunderstorm came up overhead and I filled up gas seeing people in a panic. I thought the world really was ending and that I was about to be in for it.

Anyway, I got home and confessed everything to my parents and converted to christianity. I had nightmares and bad insomnia and paranoia for a couple months that ate me up before I found a job back in the town I was living in and moved up. The fear and suspicions cleared up mostly over the course of the next year and a half, but I'm still a little edgy (over a year and a half after the trip) and have some suspicions here and there. 

My grandma died 2 and a half weeks ago and her funeral was last week, and as I said I hardly felt anything. I have done countless hours of research trying to self diagnose as I am averse to psychiatrists ever since my stay in a psychiatric ward for suicidal ideation and my extensive history with outpatient care for anger issues.

Other things to note, I have some degree of empathy (some feeling for the emotions of others and good facial recognition), social anxiety, mild OCD (I can't be as bad as others because most of my emotions feel weak compared to how they seem to be in others), am extremely lazy and unmotivated, do not feel sad or depressed except on rare occasions (though I used to be obviously depressed), but am otherwise decently high-achieving in school (high GPA in high school with some volunteer hours and high GPA in college with no volunteer hours but an in 2 honor societies)

tl;dr why the fuck am I such a selfish, angry, detached, unfeeling psycho?",18Jun2017,3
26,"First I just want to say this absolutely sucks....

My father has been accusing my mother of cheating for as far back as 10 or 12 years old. I remember hearing numerous arguments growing up as a kid, I'm 28 years old now. My parents never separated although my mom did leave the home for about a month when I was 22, she eventually came back. 

Throughout this time period, I tried my best to make sense of the arguments but my parents speak in another language that I am not very fluent in. From the sound and body language, I could tell it was my father was accusing and yelling at my mother.

I've seen my mother respond mostly calmly or sometimes she gets frustrated and just uses sarcasm and laughter. 

Their are too many arguments for me to even go over so i won't bother although I will tell you of my most tramautic memory. I probably around 20 when I woke up from the sound of a large thump and my mother screaming and crying out for me right outside my door.

I woke up with a jolt and opened my bedroom door and saw my mother lying on the ground with my father staring at her menacingly. I pushed my father back and helped my mother up and did my best to neutralize the situation.

I have a little sister, luckily she was away at college when this happened. I've never told her about this day, but since then i've consistently had insomnia. Or the worse is waking up in a sweat thinking you heard your mother scream out your name for help only to realize it was a dream. i don't think this dream will ever leave me.

My father's not a bad man. My uncle recently described him as very kind and generous when i was speaking with him about this issue. He doesn't drink or smoke, goes to work on time, fixes things around the house, provides for us in many ways. He would have been a great role model if it wasn't for his illness.

His illness, I believe after an insane amount of research, is othello syndrome. 

This is when a person obsesses over their spouse and always thinks they are cheating or about to cheat with no evidence. If they bring up evidence, it is usually unsubstantiated and baseless. They use surveillance like recording phones or camera's outside the house. Calling up constantly to check up on the spouse to see if they are at work or not.

He has been accusing my mother of cheating for several years now. My uncle believes it stems from when he cheated on my mother one time a long time ago. He believes that my father is so scared to face the truth of being a cheater, that it is easier for him to make believe that my mother has cheated and therefore all blame attention should be on her. 

My poor mother has taken the brunt of this abuse for so many years. I am such a coward. I saw the abuse, and could not muster up the courage to really do anything. I used to tell myself it is because I can't speak the same language as my father, but I know very well that he understands me when i speak in english....

I am such a coward.

I feel my fathers behaviour may have rubbed off on me as well. Sometimes I get very angry at my mother over the dumbest things. I am the worst son.

After speaking with my uncle today he mentioned that my father may have some type of mental problem. My mother used to tell me that she thought the same thing, but when she told me I would slightly brush it off because i didn't think them fighting was because my father was actually mentally ill, i thought my mom was just calling him crazy the way i call my friends crazy sometimes (non-medically)

I'm such a shitty son for not listening to my mother. After my conversation with my uncle i googled and researched and read several forums. And everything points to this disease. I've printed out all the good articles and forum posts to show my mother tommarow. I plan to apologize and ask her what she wants to do.

My fathers current plan is to take my mother to go live with him on the opposite coast of the US. I don't even think he considered my sister or I into the accuation. 

Another thing that hurt me deeply and i found suprising was my uncles impression of how my father views my sister and I. 

Apperently my father does not care for us that much, and i do remeber when i was younger in a fight i tried stepping in and raising my hands to him to make him stop yelling and he yelled back at me and said you are not my son. But i thought it was just him lashing out in anger, i had actually forgotten the whole incident until my uncle mentioned this to me. Even though it my appear from the outside that he was a bad man, I always viewed him as good. He worked hard, put food on the plate, no drugs or alcohol, even excercised in the morning, eat healthy. But he was not very involved in my or my sisters lives that much. He was always around to pick us up or give us rides but he never trully cared about what we liked or disliked..


I feel like i am analayzing my father in a whole new light. and it makes me sick to my stomach.

Has anyone else dealt with this? Know a good forum or website to speak with people who have dealt with this?

30,"So before I post this. I must explain I've done a lot of research because of this, however I'm not close to getting the answers I want.

I come from Portugal, from a small city in coastal north. Well, I am saying this because I am pretty sure my problems come from generations of inbreeding. I guess my problems come from the part of my dad. Let me explain his parents are second degree cousins, with a long history of planned marriages because they descend from high nobility and kings. Well I cannot say for sure if I am a descendant of European kings like Charlemagne or Hugh Capet, but they are on my list of ancestors in the papers.

Long story short: I am a bit inbred through my father because he comes from ""good families"".

I am estranged from my paternal family, but through the years I heard some unsettling news about them. For instance, my aunt (which present my father to my mom) swallowed beetle poison and died agonizingly, other sister a few years ago swallowed some pills probably because she was unhappy with her marriage, she is also death, my father has yet another sister who married my grandparent's cousin, they both take medication in the last 20 years because they are depressive with death of their oldest son, they have grandsons now, but I don't know nothing about them, I have one aunt with severe schizophrenia and yet another uncle who was never diagnosed but I suspect that has a personality disorder, finally I have an uncle who is healthy, but his daughter had to stop her studies because she suffers from anorexia. 

In my side there's also trouble, I have been diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder with obsessive traces a few years ago, my mother is not related to my father but she ""sees"" and ""hears"" things and suffers from depression.

But I didn't come here because all of this, it is just that just yesterday I heard the most unsettling news, doctors suspect my father is in the initial stages of dementia probably caused by alcoholism (again not sure).

And I am quite worried I might develop something worst than SPD, I somehow heard that sometimes a Personality Disorder might be a signal of Alzheimer in the future.

I am helpless right now, I don't know what to do. I wanted to someday start a family, but I wouldn't be a responsible father knowing that I might pass my bad genes to a child. I would need information about that.

I would also to know what preventive measures I can take so that I can preserve my mental health the best.

Also any other information would be helpful. 

Thank you, and sorry for the long post.",18Jun2017,1

34,"Hello r/mentalhealth. 

Backstory:

Since last year I began seeing a psychologist after having a breakdown at my university. That past year I was working a 12 midnight to 8 AM shift, then I would head to school (full time) and come home and sleep. That same cycle on repeat. Sadly I could not finish the quarter and ended up withdrawing from the university by a medical leave. I was told during our sessions with the psychologist that the anxiety and depression was something that I had been feeling since my teens but I never felt it strongly enough to affect me until I had been put in a  very emotional and financially tough situation. Eventually I  made the choice (with the support of my boyfriend) to return to my hometown and work to save some money. 

On the return home I thought that the feelings that had plagued me would vanish since the stress would be 'gone.' However, I didn't feel different and at times I felt worse. I got easily irritated, angry and anxious when I shouldn't have. Now my boyfriend has pointed out that I sleep for hours and that I do less than I used to. The scary thing is that I didn't notice myself sleeping more or feeling worse. Now I realize that I don't feel okay. As stated above: feeling angry and irritated for no reason, sleeping for most of the day, and wanting to be alone and do nothing. I thought I was okay because I  I was going to work and  I doing everything I was expected of. I have not seen a psychologist since returning home and wondering if I should.

I love my boyfriend and want to do right by me and him by working on myself. I find myself scared and anxious to see a psychologist even though I know they are there to help.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated. ",18Jun2017,2
35,"I'm 18 years old. Before being medicated with Abilify, I would have awful hateful irrational thoughts that were repetitive and ruined my mood. They were things like all social people were against unsocial people, women were inferior by nature and bad, poor or traumatized people were inherently dangerous because they were in survival mode, etc. When angry, I would ruminate with extreme and violent thoughts. These must have been psychotic symptoms because they were alleviated by an antipsychotic.

Recently, something happened. My boyfriend was saying we were breaking up. I felt like my mind was going to snap, then I had someone named Stephen speaking through me. For a couple of weeks, I'd been aware of Stephen but nothing like this had happened. He was calm and calmed the situation down. During this episode, I saw a grayish haze and things kept distorting. At the worst of it, I saw my boyfriend's face turn into a cat's and I also saw him with a long beard and hair. This happened again without the haze and distortion at the mental health place I go to. There is also a female person. Her name is unique so I won't disclose it. Other than that, I can pull him and the female person to the front partly and I can communicate with them.

I find it hard to believe I have multiple consciousness in my brain, so what else could it be but a delusion? What's going on with me?

I'm​ an 18 year old trans man and have a history of autism and methamphetamine use. I was taking 20 mg of Abilify but as of last night, I am taking 10. I decided on this change because I could not enjoy doing anything because of the high dosage. I have had about 10 auditory hallucinations in my life, none of which were connected to staying up all night. What concerns me is the ruminative thoughts. My boyfriend is schizophrenic and he also experienced anger in the same way when he was younger.

I plan to talk to my psychiatrist about this, but I was wondering if anyone had any insight on this. ",18Jun2017,3

37,"When I was 12 my mum and dad divorced and she, my brother and I moved out into a private rented house leaving our old house to our dad to stay in because she ""just couldn't live with him anymore"", she had to leave. Worth mentioning that my dad failed to keep up with mortgage payments and the house I spent 12 years of my life in was repossessed and another family bought it (they're a lovely family I've met them once or twice). 

Because I was 12 I thought this was a great transition, new house, new area, new start and all that. I noticed however my mum did not feel the same way and she became very irritable and unpleasant to be around. I was very grateful when she started spending days upon days in bed because it meant I didn't have to interact with her as much. Of course I was really naive I thought she was just really tired. She'd only ever get up for food and when it came to my food she'd give me money and I'd go to the shop and buy easy stuff to make for myself and my brother. Sometimes there'd be whole days where I wouldn't see her or hear her. 

Because of this she didn't keep up with rent payment and we were evicted, this must've given her some kind of wake up call as she was able to find another private rented house in the local area for us to live. In the new house she was never usually asleep all day but she was still very irritable. It's probably worth noting now that my little brother has become very problematic in our lives. Drugs and disrespect and police coming to our door every now and then. Shouting matches between him and my mum were now daily occurrences. At this point I'm 16 and he's 15. We were at his house for 6 months before being evicted, and me and my brother went to life with my dad for a few months while my mum looked for a social housing alternative. 

This period of time at my dads was a very upsetting for me as he lives in a flat which wasn't really to the standard I was used to and the area was less than homely. Not that I was ungrateful it just took its toll emotionally as I thought I'd never have a normal life ever again. All I wanted was a house with a mum who I didn't resent and more importantly one that I didn't feel guilty about resenting.

My mum came through however and I moved from the suburbs into the city with a housing association and life is good and my mum was doing a lot better. I'm 17 now and she's working again and my brother is behaving better than before but there's still some issues that she's yet to come to terms with.

Any mention of my grandad, her dad, upsets her. He's alive but she feels like she can't see him and just the idea of going to his house is an extremely difficult concept for her. She was meant to be going to the pub with him today but she's been in bed all day and refuses to talk to anyone. She does this every now and again, she'll bury her head and stay in bed all day but it's never as bad as before. I never want it to get to that point again and I just want to know if there's anything I can do? I can't make her do anything like go to the doctors because she just won't do it.

I'm sorry if it's lengthy but I really want to help and I don't know how.",18Jun2017,1

39,"I have an issue which I can only describe as severe boredom/an inability to be satisfied, and I'm wondering how common this is, what it is from a mental health perspective, and if there's a way to fix it.  I think it's easiest to describe via some examples.

Small scale example:  If I go bowling, to play billiards, to a video arcade, play a board game, play a video game, etc.  I'm bored very quickly.  It probably takes me five to ten minutes in most cases for me to feel like doing something else.  It makes it very hard to have fun, as the fun is always extremely short-lived.

Medium-scale example: I get bored with my job very quickly.  This has actually been a good thing for my career, as switching jobs very often has led to a pretty unique skillset, but I've never been in one job for longer than 2 years.  I get bored after the first month or so, and begin plotting my next move.

Large-scale example:  In the past 8 years I've lived in four different countries, and in eleven different cities.  I get tired of where I'm living (even if it's perfectly adequate) and want to move, get tired of the country I'm living in and want to experience something new, then get tired of that and the cycle repeats itself.

Other example:  I get tired with inanimate objects I own.  For example, I always want to change my computer, always want to change my phone, always want to change my car, even when what I currently have is adequate, just because I want something different and am bored of things as they are.  As a result, in the past ten years, I've been through probably 15 cars, 35 mobile phones, 10 computers... It's a huge waste of money, but I'm often happy to have something new until I grow bored of it after a short while.  Right now, I know that I have the ideal phone, the ideal car, the ideal computer, the ideal bed, the ideal sofa, and so on for my needs, but still, there are thoughts in my mind about changing them.  Usually I focus on one thing I want to change, and change it, then focus on something else, but the cycle seems to repeat itself quite often.

Exceptions: I don't get bored of my relationships.  My family, my spouse, my children, etc.  I'm very satisfied with them and don't feel any kind of impulse or desire to abandon my family and choose a different one, for example.

I'd love to have a day where I wasn't obsessing over changing things, and instead thankful for the things I have, but my instinctive mindset just seems to be to shake things up, all the time.  I seem to get bored more and more easily as I get older, and it's really interfering with my ability to have fun.  Although I am able to depend on my intelligence to make enough money to live comfortably enough, I know I'm wasting tons of money on things I don't need, simply out of illogical boredom.  Anyone experience anything similar? Any advice?",18Jun2017,2

44,"Most people run on auto-pilot in their daily lives, not noticing what has become monotonous and mundane. Mindfulness is the act of noticing what is going on around and inside the mind and body. This has many benefits and is a boon to wellness and mental health.

For many people including myself, one of the first steps to successfully managing mental illness is incorporating mindfulness into the recovery plan. Being aware of what is going on in the mind enables you to better cope with and change it. The more information you have about a problem, the better equipped you are to solve it. Mindfulness is about noticing the problem and taking in all the information, while also distancing yourself from the problem. There are many reasons mindfulness is a key part of Dialectical Behavior Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy.
If you are mindful of positive experiences, you enjoy them more. You take in more information about your surroundings and events that happen if you experience them mindfully. The mindful mind is simply a more conscious mind. Everyone experiences negative emotions. Since a part of emotional mindfulness is distancing yourself from emotion, mindfulness helps take the edge off emotional pain. Even for someone mentally healthy, mindfulness is great for wellbeing and happiness.

I have and had a serious problem with anger and emotion regulation. Anger is overwhelming, and negative emotions feel like the end of the world. When angry, I do and say things, to the point of violence, that are unthinkable to the not-angry me. Mindfulness was the first step in recovery from this issue. If I am mindful of my experience of anger, I know that I am just feeling an emotion, and can recognize it’s time to take steps to lessen my anger. I am proud to say I fought off anger successfully last night due to mindfulness and other skills. Mindfulness may have saved me from prison.

In addition to this, life is just better if you are mindful than if you operate on auto-pilot. I like being as conscious as possible and noticing the intricacies of my life.

If you want to be more mindful, start by setting an intention to be more mindful. This means set a goal to notice what is going on in your mind and body more and more every day. Try meditating on your breath and body sensations. Meditation has many proven benefits in addition to promoting mindfulness. Notice your breath every so often. Notice your body contacting surfaces. Notice your emotions, and patterns of your thoughts. When you eat, notice the full flavor and texture of the food. Again, mindfulness = consciousness. To be more mindful, be more conscious of yourself and your environment. There is an app on Google Play called Conscious which gives you a daily mindfulness challenge. Try it out!

One thing to watch out for is that if you are using mindfulness to treat mental illness or to regulate emotion, mindfulness may not be enough. After you notice the thought pattern or emotion, you must use other skills to tackle it. I will cover other skills in further blogs. Regardless, mindfulness is a necessary first step to recovery.

But then I face the real World.  I am closed off - to EVERYONE in my life.  I feel these feelings of paranoia.  I can't express myself.  I feel like a child.  I feel like I'm in this constant state of fear, not truly a part of any social circle.

I've used binge drinking, partying and internet as a coping mechanism.

I've had lots of insight recently; that I've been this way for a long while.  

I'm not sure whether a spell of good living - working out, eating well, sleeping and meditation, whilst gradually expressing myself is the answer.  Is it just learned habits that have gradually seen me deteriorate?  

Or do I need professional help?

I don't seem to remember relevant anectodes at all.

Another example, some of my acquaintances started discussing the Tesla Model S. I read extensively about it several months ago but the only thing I remembered was the price. Why is this? Is there something wrong with the way I read or do I have a mental problem?
