1,"Sure we all have deeply rooted childhood issues.. my parents divorced decades ago, I was raised in conflicting homes, etc.. last year I was raped twice.. the second a result of self hatred from the first.. but we aren't here to discuss that.

The last 6months or so I've noticed I have different though patterns. One who is very emotionally invested inand supportive of and excited for my long term relationship... and the other who can switch emotions off and knows I want nothing more than to be a single and free and dominating in the workplace and in life, to be successful and claims ladders.  Since last year I deal with normal PTSD symptoms.. anxiety, depression, flashbacks, etc. Lately I've come to terms with the fact that I'm asexual and I don't want people seeing my body, but my other me? The non emotional one who LOVES logic and gets high off of having the upper hand would love to besdesired sexually, they love the power that comes from that. But normally I'm asexual. It's hard to explain...

I guess I'm torn because I decided to see a therapist and the secretary asked me what my chief complaint was,, ""stress? Anxiety? Relational?"" And I realized I would like to select all of the above and then add in ptsd and maybe dissociative? I'm not sure, I don't know what's wrong with me.",10Oct2017,3

3,"Hello, I am male in my early 20's, living in the UK. I've been experiencing this thing, I don't really know if I should call it a symptom or not. I've been searching around and I haven't been able to find anything about this, but maybe I'm just bad at searching, I don't know.

Anyway, I occasionally have been having this thing happen where my inner monologue goes a bit weird. Basically the thoughts that I'm thinking feel not like they're being thought normally, but like they're shouting at me. Like my own thoughts are shouting really loud. Also other sounds around feel really overwhelmingly loud, even though they don't actually sound loud. They are normal volume, they just feel 'shouted' in the same way my thoughts are. Worth noting that it doesn't feel like my thoughts are not me, and I'm not hearing any thoughts or voices that aren't 'my own'. This happens most often in relation to episodes of stress and/or anxiety.

Is this something I should see a doctor about? It's pretty disconcerting, but I don't know if it's actually impacting my life in a severely negative way. Has anyone heard of something like this before?",10Oct2017,1

What person do I see? I don't want to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist if I'm having problems with something that fits into another category of mental health.  
I've had treatment for depression and I don't really get properly depressed any more, that seemed to end with time. But I am having problems generally with invasive thoughts, obsessive thought patterns, not being able to deal with being around other people, etc.",10Oct2017,3
5,"After watching news in the USA from both political sides, I am angered and disgusted at the lack of professionalism in the media. The media perpetuates the myth or stereotype that people with mental illness are violent and cannot be trusted. Many are doing this because they are grasping at straws trying to find an explanation for this tragedy at the expense of all who suffer from mental illness.

First they speculate that he may have antisocial personality disorder. I won't get into the circular logic of this diagnosis, but I will say that it is not a true mental illness. Illnesses can be treated. Antisocial personality disorder cannot.

Next, they pretend to be clinicians. We cannot possibly know what, if any mental illness he had. He's dead. He cannot be examined by a professional psychiatrist.

They also go so far as to say that diazepam is a likely cause to his violence. The main side effects of this drug are drowsiness. That's what benzodiazipines do. There is a less common side affect of irritability and aggression. How many people experiencing those less common side effects kill 58 people?

What are the implications of these assertions made by the media and possibly law enforcement, politicians, etc.? First, anyone with mental illness will not be able to own guns. This includes those taking drugs like Paxil. One proposal by Democrats is to waive HIPAA, and share all your medical records with the Feds. 

You may not care about gun ownership or just not agree with it, but this is one more step to the mentally ill becoming second class citizens. A police officer can pull you over and learn on her computer that you took Prozac from 1/25/1999-4/23/2002. This is not right.

It's not right that someone taking an antidepressant could now get labeled a ""psychopath"" based on what someone saw on TV. My friend's mom took Paxil for two days. Will she now engage in mass violence? The stereotypes have been going on for awhile with all the mass shootings.

There needs to have a voice that protects those who suffer from mental illness, especially when incidents like these occur. I'm not calling for a group advocating for gun rights for the civil and responsible mentally ill. I'm calling for a voice to break stereotypes and give accurate information about mental health when these incidents occur. I watch Fox News a lot, and have yet to see coverage or interviews of psychiatrists or psychologists. NAMI is no where to be seen. 

How much more can be tolerated!?

7,"Throwaway. 

Part of this might actually be better posted in /r/relationships or whatever, but I have two things and they both may be related (somehow?) I don't know. 

First, I recently changed careers. Like, complete 180, not even the same industry. Before, I knew Literal Everything and was Super Confident in what I did and what I could do. Now (for money and not be in a dead-end, so-to-speak), I am in a field I know literal nothing about, with a sort of ""multiple hats"" role that would all be considered ""entry-level"" on their own, but they just stack in responsibilities, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed by it all. 

Haven't really had issues till the past two work days in which I finally got ""feedback"" from one of my bosses (long story). My immediate response was ""oh, good, now I have a direction."" Except as I progressed, the ""direction"" I was given turned out to be a lot more difficult for me to obtain consistently. No big deal, just work at it. Then today, just hit after hit of tiny little ""failures"" (I know none of it was actually my fault, and mostly was the fault or cause of an uncontrollable thing outside the sphere of my control) all lined up and just made me feel like I didn't matter. Driving home felt like I was being remote-controlled, or something. I don't remember any of my drive home. 

This just being part of the issue. 

Part two: I am in a relationship. The best relationship of my life. Literally. She's amazing, I love her to death, we're super compatible (so far) and have yet to find some ""argument"" or disagreement or negative reaction that we couldn't resolve and deal with then and there. We have an awesome sex life, we have a great rapport and we tell each other (almost) everything. Yeah, almost. That's where the issue comes in. 

Some background: I've never *not* cheated in a relationship. I had always assumed ""well, I guess it just wasn't meant to be."" Was even married (mistake) and thought it was different, but it wasn't. Go figure. Then I found my current girlfriend. Re-read the above first portion of that paragraph to get a feel for what I almost re-wrote here. Yeah. She's that amazing. 

But I still am tempted to cheat. My only thought is why? Is it self-sabotage? Is it fear that it's too good to be true? I will admit that, in this relationship, it has taken the *longest* amount of time for me to get to the point where I'm finally tempted (almost two years this time around). 

The reason I am first asking/posting here about this is that I want to try and rule out a mental health issue (recently diagnosed with ADD, too, so that may be part of it) before coming to the ""I'm a douchebag and should just not date people"" conclusion, or some semblance of that. 

All this being in my mind makes me want to go to a shrink about it. But that would mean admitting to the GF that I need to see one. What do I tell her when she asks what about? We share a bank, so I can't hide money to pay for it without her knowing, and she is currently not working, so is very well aware of when I am home and when I am not (NOT in a territorial or jealous or otherwise negative fashion, just incidentally). 

And then, what if we (me, her, therapist, bhudda, whoever ""we"" ends up being) determine that I can't really be a good fit for her? This leads me to another part. She isn't working (as stated above) and cannot support herself right now. It would be selfish of me to make her go live on her own, as I'm the primary reason she no longer has a job (helped her leave her old work in which her boss was a narcissistic misogynist who never told her anything positive, despite the many things she did to create an amazing atmosphere for those she was responsible for).  

It's been wreaking havoc in my brain, and I think alone either the first or second part would have been fine. But they are combining into a large conglomerate of issues in my brain that I just cannot comprehend, and I am not able to do anything about because my new career doesn't exactly offer benefits yet, and we can't afford to do much out of pocket (therapist-wise). 

Yeah. Idk.",10Oct2017,2

11,"I'm at a point right now where I really don't know what to do. Everything seems to be spiraling out of control, and I want to both gain a grip on the situation, work to resolve it, and turn my life around. I am seeing a mental health counselor on Wednesday. The following is the series of events that have led to my current situation and poor mental state.

### Background ###

I am a freshman, started college about 1.5 months ago. I started texting with a girl a few months back and things progressed extremely quickly once we got to college. She was my first everything after kissing. Over the first month of college, we were in some of a relationship. Things moved quickly, there were some issues early on that led us to take a break for one weekend. We were really really close, staying over at each other's place 4-6 times a week, sex almost every other day, and she occupied a significant amount of my free time. I became close with people on my floor in the kind of L shape of my hall that formed around my room (I am in the corner room). I have small groups of people I hang out with, but none that I am nearly as close with. They, school, the girl I was seeing, all occupied my time. It was the first time in a while that I had my shit together in life, and everything seemed like it was working out. There was a period of a few days where I had no worries, my first few grades were good, me and the girl were good, and I had a good group of close friends and some other friends, and I was sleeping pretty well too. My relationship with the girl was spotty, and somewhat unhealthy at times. It is good that things eventually ended, but it's hard to let go. 

### A little before the end ###
The girl and I had been going well with one problem, she had been getting rather close with another guy. During our short break (roughly 2.5 weeks in), she and this guy hung out a bit, and I saw another girl. Once we got back together, I broke everything else off, but she continued to hang with this guy in a non-sexual way. In the week or so leading to us ending things, she was pretty secretive about this guy, and assured me nothing was happening there. 

### Two weeks ago - the end ###
We sat down and had a much more serious talk about what was happening between me, her, and the other guy. She didn't want us to keep having problems. I posed her the question of staying with me, or going to the other guy (nothing physical had happened between them at this point). After a lot of talking, some crying, she decided she wanted to be with the other guy. *(I asked her then and more recently if I was doing anything wrong, and she insisted/insists that everything was fine on my end, she just had some weird feeling with this guy which attracted her to him.)* That was two weeks ago (Monday). As a result of the events on that Sunday and Monday, I ended up performing really poorly on my math quiz. I thought that the best way for me to cope would be to start having sex with someone else. And it helped. I saw this other girl multiple times over the past two weeks. During the weekend following the breakup, I danced with/kissed two other girls. I really thought that I was moving on then and things were going to start on the upward trend for me... then this past week happened.

### The past week ###
Sunday night: as I was falling asleep I started reminiscing on the past week, the break up, and how I felt towards the girl I was with for over the first month of college. I felt lonely, and my cycle of sleep deprivation began. I missed sleeping with someone else in the bed. I slept through my morning class. 

Monday: I made the decision to see/speak with her again, in person. In some ways this made things feel better, while making my nostalgia worse. 

Tuesday: my studying/cramming/preparing as much as possible for my math midterm Wednesday. More thoughts of the girl, and a significant amount of stress from the midterm. I end up being unable to fall asleep at a reasonable hour. The time keeps ticking on by and I realize that if I fall asleep (2~3AMish), I was going to miss my exam (8 AM). I pulled an all-nighter. 

Wednesday: the exam goes poorly. I can't sleep again, end up sleeping from 5-9:20AM. My sleep cycle is absolutely fucked at this point, I can't stop thinking about the girl and why she's with the other guy, and my math grade is now in a bad place. 

Thursday: I somehow end up in her room at 2AM watching Netflix. I really don't know what the fuck was happening, but we were just watching Netflix. Her drunk roommate comes in and starts trying to start shit with her. Talking about her new boyfriend and how we shouldn't be together at all. It was all fucked, I just sat there and left when I could. 

Friday: the girl has gone home for break, I'm in a really poor mental state, have barely gotten sleep. At least I had my friends, for now. At some point in the middle of the night, I was feeling really shitty. I went out to be with my friends but they were in a pissy mood. One thing led to another and we got in a big fight, and I snapped. No one in the L shape of my hall is speaking to me now. I've been back home since then, and haven't seen anyone. I suspect my relationship with them will be injured for at least 1-3 weeks... without getting into details it was a really really bad situation. 

### My mental state ###
I've just been feeling really shitty. Really shitty about the girl, my loss of my main friends, my grades, my sleep. I'm seeing a counselor when I get back Wednesday to talk about this more. I'm slowly working to piece my life back together. Sleep first, is slowly returning to normal times (23:30-7ish). I'm hoping to be back on my normal schedule by Wednesday. Next, friends, I'm in a position where I have decided to lay low for the time being from my hall neighbors. Not necessarily avoid interaction, but not make an initiative to interact. I have since apologized to them for what happened, and told them to approach me whenever they're ready. With that said, I now am in a position where I have very few friends and want to still remain social, or at least have people to talk to on a regular basis. It was easy to do during the first few weeks, but now it's harder to find a group of people I mesh with and are wanting to mesh with me. I'm going to be visiting my math professor's office hours, etc., I can fix school/grades on my own. My biggest problem is that I am very isolated now, and don't really know who to turn to or how to proceed. Do I just shelter myself in my room for the next few weeks while working on schoolwork all the time - probably not. I want things to return to a state of normalcy, be that with these friends, or another group. I want friends, I want to be with another girl, I'm just a fucking mess... 

### In closing ###

Any advice on how I should go on about my life would be appreciated. I know what I want, I just have no idea how to achieve or begin working towards resolving it. I yearn for the time a few weeks back when everything was perfect, because I feel like everything's all fucked up right now. 

tl;dr my life in college is a fucking mess because of friends, girl, school, sleep and I don't know how to proceed. ",10Oct2017,1

13,"I haven't had a romantic relationship with a woman in my life. The rare times that I have mustered the courage to try and get into a relationship with a girl have all failed. Most recently, yesterday I was rejected by this girl I really liked. She was sending me what I thought were a lot of strong signals over the span of several weeks, but when I asked she told me she already had a partner... I don't buy it but whatever.

I'm devastated...this is the 12th rejection or so in a row. I feel ugly, short, unattractive, destined to be alone. I'm tremendously insecure about my appearance and my only positive (intelligence) doesn't really seem to be appreciated in the ""dating scene"".

I don't even know what to do... I want to see a professional but I'm so busy with my PhD that I don't know if I'll have time. I have a few male friends, but no one really close. I have no one to share my feelings with. I'm incredibly lonely. Help me.",10Oct2017,2

16,"Hello, This is a throwaway account. I have been feeling very confused and sad lately, I really need some help. I don't know whether the things I've been feeling are normal teenage feelings or something else. I have a great family and life but I have a hard time opening up to people, So that's why I'm here. 

I feel very empty and numb most of the time. I'm not sure if I feel is actually empty or just how things are. I do a lot of things on auto pilot and feel like my head is just somewhere else.  I often catch myself doing this and try to make myself focus but it doesn't work. Everything just feels so empty and devoid of emotion. It feels like I'm being kept at arms length. Even the things I love are empty and distant.

It's not to say that I never feeling emotion, Because I do. I cry, get angry, laugh, get nervous, all that stuff. I rarely feel happy though. Someone close to me once suggested that perhaps I try to hard to find happiness. That I focus to much on trying to find happy instead of just being happy.  I do search for happiness in things but can you blame me? I just want to feel happy so desperately but I just can't and I'm so tired.

Why do things feel so empty? Are these feelings normal? Am I making something out of nothing?

17,"Hi there, 

I am moving soon to stay with someone who's helping me while I've had a difficult time living in Colorado these past few years. However as a requirement for my stay, I have to speak to a psychologist. Those close to me have seen plenty of potential symptoms with my actions and words. This is supposedly, as I feel I don't relate or do most of the characteristics for ASPD/Sociopathy. I know that doesn't help in saying I'm not affected by ASPD/Sociopathy.

Now my two main questions are:

In the Denver area (Close to Lakewood/Arvada/LoHi), are there any affordable psychologists that anyone could PM recommend me to?

And the second question, is while I feel I life a fairly normal lifestyle (outside of the 2 incidents that have lead to this psychology meeting). But what do I do if I am diagnosed with ASPD/Sociopathy? I feel normal, I don't go out of my way to lie or hurt people. but such a diagnosis I know will make most of my family fear me or lose trust in me due to the stigma and nature of the diagnosis. 

I'm just afraid to be told I'm affected by some illness that I cannot control and will ruin my life while I can't even actively stop it.

Thank you for your time to read this and I hope things are going well for all of you out there un/affected by any illness or disease.",10Oct2017,0
18,"Recently I’ve been doing everything I can to try to figure out who I am outside of my disabilities. I got a psychiatric service dog, I’m medicated, I’ve been doing everything I can to make myself feel good on the outside and inside.

The problem is that I’m falling apart still. Last night I was going to bed before my wife and I had a debilitating panic attack simply because I couldn’t find my night mask. It was so bad that I ended up seizing. 

Lately it’s everything I can do to keep up the facade. Only my wife knows what’s going on because everyone worries about my past suicide attempt; so telling people leads to panic which tends to make things worse for me. 

At this point I have been feeling suicidal again. I’m terrified of telling my therapist because I don’t want to be locked up again because of it. I just need some advice from people that have actually gone through this, I guess. ",10Oct2017,2
19,"these are things about him:

when he was around 5 he squeezed a frog to death for fun
he mightuv done other things to animals but i dont remember.
me and our sister are older than him and you could say we've always excluded him for being the younger child.   
I used to be very rude to him,  &amp; bully him.  a few times i threw anger fits directed toward him when i was about 11 and he was about 7.
he was a bed wetter up until about 6th grade ish
now he is 14,  he seems to not care much social friendships, he declines to go birthday parties and events,  he plays tons of minecraft and cant stop talking about how good he is at it,  he is sort of addicted,  he doesnt talk much to the family unless about minecraft.
he hates a lot of things/people just for their imperfections.  (i used to think this way at 14 also).
even though we all grew up in a christian home,  he is the least religious person i know, and its almost like he never questioned religion, he was just born not believing or not caring for it.  maybe this is because he doesnt understand the whole philosophy of loving one-another,  or jesus dying to save us.
lastly, Ive never seen him do anything out of compassion or kindness or caring for others.. and ive never seen him feel sorry/apologetic (although he is a bit of a goody two shoes).  
so what do you think?   2nd edit:  oh he also doesnt listen to any kind of music

20,"It's gotten so bad. I'm not depressed but I'm painfully anxious. Apparently ECT doesn't help with that and my doctor won't put me on a medication to treat it. For the past three weeks it's been constant nightmares and they keep getting worse. It started out I'd have a mild nightmare one night, then normal dreams for two nights, then another nightmare. Then the next week it was one nightmare, one good dream, and then another nightmare. Now it's every night. Every night they get a little scarier, too. The other night I had one so bad I cried for an hour after word at 3 am. I don't want to sleep anymore. I'm too scared. I've tried to stop watching the news because everything is terrifying, but everyone still talks about the terror going on in the world. I don't know if the anxiety is fuelling the nightmares or if it's the other way around but I need it to stop asap. My mom asks me what I'm anxious about so I can cut it out of my life, but she doesn't understand that I'm anxious about literally everything. I'm scared that world war three is coming. I'm scared that I'll be involved in a car crash. I'm scared my cat will get out and get hit by a car. I'm scared about everything and it all get mixed in with the nightmares and I just want to hide in a dark room where nothing bad can ever happen. You know what's worse than those dreams where you can't scream? Dreams where you *can*. Because then you can hear the terror in your voice. It's like mental torture and you can't wake up and make it stop. And I'm so anxious I can't sit still or focus on one thing. I don't want to tell my doctor half of this because all she ever does is pump me full of medication or send me to the hospital. I don't want more meds and I sure as hell don't want to go to the hospital because I just fucking got out after a month and a half long stay. This is almost physically painful. I don't know what the hell im supposed to do anymore. I've tried countless antipsychotics and antidepressants and mood stabilizers and I've had ECT but when one problem ends another begins.

23,"EDIT: I'm sorry for the long post but if you think you can help please please read all of it. I know you guys aren't able to diagnose me, but if someone with bpd or an extensive knowledge of the disorder tell me whether or not it's worth it to see a therapist over this that would be very helpful.


I'm not going to self diagnose and I'll try to fit therapy into my schedule but I don't think that's going to happen as I've been pretty busy lately with my new job and dealing with stress and depression.



I've been on the edge of self-diagnosing before and then I'll watch interviews with someone who has the disorder and I'll quickly change my mind and decide it was a mistake to even go down that road. I know how easy it is to self-diagnose, and also how inaccurate it is, but I seriously think I have bpd.


Besides self-harm, I have all the characteristics of someone with bpd. And it's a very loose term to begin with, so I don't think it's that extreme to think I have it. 


- I've been diagnosed with depression for a few years now, but I'm pretty sure I've had it since the 5th grade. 


- I grew up in an extremely unstable household with issues I don't even want to get into in this post.


- I want to say I'm trying my hardest not to engage in compulsive activities, but if I think about it for more than a few minutes I'm pretty emotionally driven. Not many people *want* to think this of themselves, but I don't have much self-control.


- I hate myself but that's kind of a given with depression, right?


- I have a bad habit of getting into fights with close friends and not speaking to them for days at a time, and it's always over something stupid that, in retrospect, doesn't even matter to me. At the time I think it matters but it's all just stupid outbursts and I think I need to continue not talking to them in order to justify to myself that what I said and did was right, even though I was in the wrong every time. That sounds stupid but I haven't done this in a while so I think I'm getting better at that.


I'm sorry if I sound uninformed or stupid because I know how annoying it is when people self diagnose but I seriously think I might have this. I thought I just had depression and anxiety but those can both fall under symptoms of bpd so I really have no idea anymore.

I do know for a fact there's some shit going on up there that I just want to avoid for as long as I can because most of it scares me, but I don't think that has anything to do with bpd. It could though, I have no idea, so if any of that would matter or if any more context is needed to what goes on in my head please feel free to ask. I'm honestly just dreading going to a therapist and I know I won't get clear answers on here since none of you know me in person but I just want an explanation to why the fuck I am what I am.

I've thought about killing people before, never done it but I know for sure I'm totally capable. I'm not a sociopath I'm a totally normal person (well not entirely, but I don't know the words to describe what's wrong with me) but I've wanted to kill someone for a good 3 years now. It's gotten horribly worse recently. I've thought about killing my best friend, my mom, my boss, the whole shebang. This isn't normal for me, the urges usually come in small amounts and I can get rid of them really quickly because I have a sense of morality and I know these thoughts are not okay.


Anyways, tonight has been a roller coaster. I half planned out how I would kill someone and then decided I didn't want to go to jail because I would totally be caught. Then I decided jail isn't so bad and whatever, then I decided that was crazy I would hate jail. I need to be watched I can't do this on my own it's just getting worse. I'm afraid I'll hurt someone, because if my family weren't on the other side of that door I would've by now.


I don't want them to know that I'm thinking this stuff, they don't even have the slightest clue and I don't want their perception of me to be destroyed. I have a good relationship with them besides my dad and sister. I don't want my future to be ruined by helping myself, because I don't want a record. But I don't know how long I'll last since it's only getting worse with each day someone please tell me what to do, I want to have a normal life I don't want to put myself on records and have my family think I'm a crazy person who's going to hurt them. I would never hurt my family because there's no getting out of that one.

And lately, loud sounds have made me really angry and irritable. I also get very irritated at my surroundings when I travel by bus or subway. I have never been that way before and I doesn't seem to recognize myself :(
I also cry quite easily and get sad and angry at my partner for the tiniest things. I feel like such a bitch and feel really guilty and mean after my angry/sad/irritated episodes have passed. It has gotten harder for me to get to school these few weeks and I get tons of anxiety and doesn't have the energy for either school or work, and because of that, I get more anxiety for not working or missing out in school.

32,"Ever since I got myself to a better state of mental wellness I feel like I have lost something, and it doesn't feel like it's something good.

When I was a bit crazy I almost identified with it and just road the wave of craziness and thought little of the consequences and can say that I was actually doing way more fun stuff with my life.  I feel like the energy that I once had was a double edged sword , in some ways it brang depression, addiction, over inflated ego and probably a few bad personality traits. However it also brought an immense passion/fire burning inside of me, spontaneity, fun seeking and a higher energy level in general. Now that I feel somewhere balanced between the two o feel like I have become boring, it's strange since I went to counselling I ended up losing a lot of people that I thought were my friends but they either got bored of the new me or I lost the crazy glasses and was able to see them more clearly.",10Oct2017,3

34,"Might be a stupid question, but most of the time, when there is something urgent, or scary, I fall into a state of relaxation. I once got robbed, and during said robbery I was surrounded, had my phone stolen, etc.. and I remember not feeling distressed until after the robbery, during the robbery, I felt emotionless, is this just how I cope? Another example, I was looking for a rat in my house, and there was what I thought to be a rat tail, and my mom ran away yelling, thinking it was also a rat tail, but during this search for the rat, instead of being scared, or freaked out, I just didnt feel a sense of urgency, when there definitely was. I'm 17 years old, and I also think that maybe its because teens sometimes think they are invincible? Maybe thats why I am not in a urgent mood when facing danger?

Is there a name for this?

I hate myself and I want to commit suicide.  

I hate myself to the core. Passionately. I feel like I am forever doomed to be stupid and slow without a chance of ever changing myself. I don't believe I can change, it's a feeling of total hopelessness and impossibility that I cannot manage to describe. I think I am naturally screwed up, that my very own nature, blood, DNA is failing me and keeping me behind. I don't want to become like my mother. Annoying and sort of stupid. I want to overcome my condition but I feel like it's beyond my control. There is nothing I could do. 

I'm obsessed over every freaking mistake I make during a day. A voice in my head is always telling me how worthless and stupid I am, how I should be shameful for it and just end it. My mother was very critical with me but it's not like she hadn't a reason to complain about me. But it seems that instead of making me want to be better, criticism is just depressing me and making me get numb and I get this feeling of paralysis. My ex boyfriend was an idealist too, had very high expectations of me, very critical over every little thing. All my friends said he most of the times got advantage over my kindness and was brainwashing me into thinking I was always to be blamed. But are they right? What if I'm trully annoying and stupid and people just don't get the patience to be with me? 

I don't respect myself, I feel like I can't stand for my own opinions because what if they are wrong? What if my truth and way of thinking is wrong, what if my mind is not rational and doesn't follow the very common sense of logic, ethics. I am very easily influenced and seem to not have a fixed value system because I am always thinking how everything is so relative in life and that maybe I can't even rely on myself, trust my judgement. I have 0 self esteem.

I feel like on paper I'm all good. I attented a music school in middle school. I have a beautiful voice but not well trained. I am in a choir but I feel like others are so much better than me. I played the violin, now I barely know to play something decent and worth listening to. I am at University, I study two languages besides english. But it's always almost. Almost ok. Never better. How am I becoming a linguist if I have anxiety attacks everytime I speak in my own language? I can't seem to articulate myself and I sound like a total dumbass when I open my mouth. At class we need to talk to exercise the languages we study but I don't have the courage and when I am forced, I always mess up because I'm afraid and think slower than the rest of my peers. I also do mindless things because I'm not able to concentrate, focus enough and I'm an airheaded.

The worst thing about all of these things is that I am considered by most people I know, a very beautiful girl. I'm always complimented on my physique. They say I should just be satisfied because others are ugly. I hate it so much and I want to throw up because now I'm becoming the famous pretty but dumb stereotype.

When I tell others about my dark thoughts many disagree with me and say that I am too obsessed with my flaws. That maybe I am airheaded but not stupid. And that I am talented and other qualities that I think are very exaggerated. I want to be praised for what I know for sure I achieved. Not for half things or almosts or beginnings. I don't believe them because I know some think of me as stupid. 
 
I am lazy too to make it even worse. 

My brain hurts and I just want to end it and to die. I don't want to live with myself anymore. I just can't describe enough this feeling of utter disgust toward myself.

Is there anybody like me in here? Should I get help? Is this solvable? Or should I just end it? I'm desperate and I need help.

Sorry for the possible flawed grammar. I'm not a native speaker of english and I'm stupid like that.

TL;DR: I'm a pretty considered girl but I hate myself passionately and I want to kill myself.",10Oct2017,8
42,"I frequently read the posts in this sub, r/aspergers, and r/bipolar and they have been a fantastic resource for me therapeutically.

I’ve been going through a really hard time for the past few years. It started with getting fired from a well-paying job I had in 2015. Looking back at that, I was actively suicidal and really needed help but I didn’t know how to get it.

I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom several times over the last few years and it really has been a struggle to see the light at the end of the tunnel and to figure out a way to climb out of this hole I’ve been in. 

I recently was put on Cymbalta for my bipolar depression and it really has made such a difference.  Depression can be so debilitating and it feels like I’m finally back to being myself again.

I’ve been volunteering with a local political organization on and off since 2011 with the hope of building my resume and getting a paying job in politics. The 7 years I’ve put in with them has finally paid off and I was just offered a full time paying position with them that starts in 2 weeks.

On top of that, because I got this new job, I also decided to put myself out there again and start dating again. I have a dinner date with someone tomorrow evening that I am really excited about.

43,"Please just hear me out. I know the first thing people say to someone who says they have a mental illness or emotional issues is to go see a therapistans try medication.

I have depression and PTSD. Was also diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but that was back in the 90s when every other kid was. I suffered through sexual abuse and emotional abuse for years, especially as a teenager.

I've been to a long list of doctors, therapists, and social workers ever since I was a kid. Some of them I did like and got to see for a long length of time. I tried a handful of depression medications, too. None of them I remember doing anything, except for one I was allergic to and another I just felt the side affects.

At every appointment I went to as an adult, I just felt like I was ripping away at old wounds. Which, I know is kind of the point, but I always walked away feeling shattered. I never walked away feeling like I had something constructive or helpful to go off of and help me cope. Even with the nicest and kindest professionals.

And I'll be honest, when I've gone periods of time without seeing a professional, that's when most of the healing happened. That's when I learned to be able to function and cope. I've done a lot of reading, taken college psychology classes, and have learned more about myself since I've been out on my own. One of the latest doctors I've seen, maybe a year or two ago, I explained all of this to. He actually said that I have apparently done very well without therapy. He said I definitely have PTSD, but I have the personality of someone who is very logical and rational. It's hard to say that about myself objectively, but I think that's why I've been able to cope better on my own. I believed all of my life that I'm worthless and would never succeed in life or be able to do the simplest things. I used to hate myself so much. But I've learned that's not true. I proved it to myself by actually being an adult and taking care of myself. Someone simply telling me in therapy I'm worthwhile and that it's not my fault never did anything for me.

Whenever I've tried to explain this to people, no one believes me. Because apparently therapy is the best and only solution to mental illness and emotional problems.",10Oct2017,1

My parents never gave me the legitimacy that kids need. They would always tell me I'm either being dramatic, or that I was over-reacting.  So that's what I've always thought, that there's nothing wrong with me.

My whole life, I have had almost Zero say in anything regarding me. Shit, even my last counselor was through my mom's recommendation. That one said I was completely fine, ""but we can put you on SSRIs"" that cause you to miss class due to ungodly illness.

The second and most recent counselor I've spoken to had me do a bunch of assessments, looked at them concerned, and I haven't heard back in almost a year. 

So here I am now, in my first trimester of a college for a career I never thought about doing ""because it's close to your brother, and it makes things easier for everyone"".

I didn't want to be here. I wanted to do either business or Archaeology, something so I could travel and have job security. Shit, I'm not even in the actual program yet, I'm in the Undergrad (after already being driven to get 2 associate's..)

But I've actually made friends and connections on my own, without my brother, and thanks to a spending spree, I don't have enough for next trimester.

When my mother was a teenager, her older sister commit suicide. I know my mum has never gotten over this, she has two older brothers too, but no one can replace your older sister really.

I never met my aunt but my mum has told me that I am her reincarnated basically, which makes me so sad for my mum because I cannot imagine ever losing my brother in such a tragic way, let alone have your child remind you of them. I want to do something for my mum and in honour of my aunt. This has trickled through the family and affected us all mentally, and I do believe mental illness runs throughout our family, it definitely affected my aunt.

51,"My brother (I'll call him ""A"") has had signs of mental problem for maybe a few years. Over time he has given up on pursuing any kind of meaningful work, traveled around and was ""homeless"" for a few nights, asks everyone for money, randomly sends rude/upsetting/scary text messages to family members, has physically assaulted someone at least once. 

""A"" has been staying at my aunt's rental home free... for 3+ years now. My aunt doesn't know how to get him out. He's become increasingly paranoid that my uncle is sneaking into the house when ""A"" is away. 

That brings us to this past weekend.

2am on Sunday morning ""A"" shows up at my other brother's (we'll call him ""B"") apartment and wants to spend the night. ""A"" says he can't stay at his house because he is not safe there. ""B"" lets ""A"" into the apartment and goes to bed. At 5am, ""B""'s girlfriend wakes up for work and ""A"" is sitting there staring at the wall, wide awake. She thinks ""A"" did not sleep at all.

I don't really know what happens the rest of the day until... 

Sometime on Sunday night, ""A"" goes to my aunt's house and steals her car. I am not clear if he had a car key or if he took a key from her house - but this is the same aunt that has let him live rent free for 3 years. 

""A"" takes the car, crashes into a median on the highway. Aunt and ""B"" drive to pick him up from the police station. They get him in the car and somewhere along the way he ""jumps out of the car"". My aunt and ""B"" try for 3 hours to get ""A"" back in the car. The sheriff comes. Eventually they leave him on the side of the road. 

During the day on Monday, ""B"" drives out to pick ""A"" up from the sheriff's office. I don't really know how he got there. While driving to the sheriff, ""B"" is informed that ""A"" has been transferred to the ER because he had told the sheriff that ""you are going to harvest my organs"".

Over the course of Monday, ""A"" gets a CT scan, blood, urine, and mental evaluation. In the end, they can't force him to go anywhere but he agrees to go to a 3 day stay at a psychiatric facility. Now it is nearly noon on Tuesday and they are ""still trying to place him in a facility"". 

I live out of town. Everyone is at a loss of what to do, so I am trying to organize and keep people in communication as much as possible.

Those suffering from mental health issues are at a much higher risk of suicide. People who commit suicide, 90% of the time have/had diagnoseable illnesses.

Today is National Mental Health Awareness day, which sounds like it might be pandering to ""snowflakes"", but Mental Illness isn't just a ""Millennial thing"". Mental illness affects all of us, either directly or indirectly.

The people I consider to be my close friends have mental health issues; from Traumatic Brain injuries, to Anorexia, PTSD, and Depression, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.

So instead of telling someone ""It's all in your head"" remember; it might be in their head, but they have little to no control over how it impacts them. And when you're upset because someone cancelled plans, or is ""boring"", think of how bad they feel. They know they affect those closest to them. But they don't do it it of spite. I know that, as I personally suffer from mental issues.

Hello, I just came on here to talk about me.

I find that often I just feel shit, just empty, fake, embarrassed for who I am. I have no reason for this, I'm a good academic, I'm smart, but bad at sports, this doesn't bother me though.

But I find around my friends I'm just so awkward, so frigid, I worry about everything, I count out scenarios of things going wrong in my life, I examine everything I do right and wrong but mostly wrong.

Like, I get a 'bad' mark, (I have overly high standards of myself in my school life and anything under 3/4 marks is a failure to me) and I'll immediately just go quiet, and think of how shit I am for not meeting my own standards, people will ask what I got and I'll just not say anything, go really awkward, and even if I tell them, they'll say I did well, when deep down I know I'm just a waste.

I also have really low self confidence, pride, etc, I find I'm rarely proud of myself for what I do and accomplish. I'm also I guess quite introverted normally and I prefer to work/be alone so that doesn't really help with the whole social awkwardness, I hate speaking, and I've felt recently like my emotions just drown me wherever I go, whatever I do. I'm also a cryer, even when I don't want to, I can just start crying over small things I legitimately don't care about and I'm usually picked on for over exaggerating what happens, even if I explain I can't help it, people just don't understand.

I feel like I was born in dirt. I wish I lived on a farm. My brain thinks like a nazi yet I have no people to be proud of and I am not white. I just finished watching a documentary about Spain and was intrigued that Spain has ethnic groups like the Basque, it's basically a ""nazi"" state where everyone in the state works to preserve their language and way of life or identity. Yet I look like a fat consumer slave like the people rioting for szechuan sauce because of watching a cartoon. I feel too smart or too controversial for my case workers and doctors (I wish I went to the one when I was under my dad's insurance instead of these free ones that suck). That's another thing, I was born to parents that got lucky by getting a city job that has set them up for life, so I don't have to worry about taking care of them. I have no responsibility, but we are not super rich (yet my situation is kind of like those people that win the lotto and end up unstable after a year). I feel like a sardine. I have no social skills, and acquiring them now seems impossible. I know too much about politics, how the world works, what motivates people subconsciously, ... it all makes me very depressed. I wish I was born in an era without the internet.

also, how can people write books like Dune (Kwisatz Haderach, Truth Trance, seeing both feminine and masculine avenues) and Don Quixote (bearded ladies) without taking my mindset to write those books yet the authors seem normal to me?

73,"TL;DR: Minor car accident happened and I checked myself into a psych ward. The nurses were bad, I didn't see my doctor and social worker for 5 days, and it sucked overall. Looking for others who understand this bullshit.

I was in a minor car accident a week ago and it triggered my PTSD so bad that I blacked out. I didn't even know it happened and I got back home. It was just mirrors bumping. The police knocked on my in-laws door and they found out about the accident before I really knew about it. Something felt off but I didn't know what.

When I found out I committed a hit and run, I got suicidal and started planning to kill myself. My fiance noticed this and took me to the ER that I was in last time when I was admitted for a psychosis caused by an allergic reaction.

We thought they would admit me because I had a plan and I was obviously not doing well. They literally told me to go home and to see my therapist in a week. I was about to kill myself and they sent me back home.

My fiance started calling my psychiatrist when we got home to figure out what to do. In that time, I blacked out again from PTSD. When I came back, I had flushed all of my pain meds and thyroid meds. I was immediately taken to another ER.

This other ER took me seriously and placed a security guard in my room. They refused to give me my pain meds though and I've been in pain management for 3 years. They eventually gave me 1/9 of my normal dose in a 12 hour release pill. It also took 16 hours to get a psych evaluation. 

I had a video chat with the doctor and they immediately decided I could be admitted. Apparently it wasn't a 72 hour hold but I didn't know this until 3 days later. It only took about 3 hours after my admittance to find me a bed. I got there and started the admittance process in the psych hospital.

I was told by the charge nurse to sit on this chair and wait until he was ready to admit me. He wouldn't allow me to attend group with these people, even though it was held 10 feet in front of me. I sat there for 3 hours, getting yelled at if I moved or asked him a question. He also took a 1 hour lunch before admitting me. 

He eventually admitted me and somehow got all of my information wrong. He didn't put my medications in correctly and it ended up fucking me over for the first 2 days. It took another 1.5 hours to admit me because he was bad with the computer. I arrived at 2 pm which was plenty of time for me to meet my doctor, social worker, and nurses for the day. It was Friday so it was important to meet my official doctor. One of my pharmacies is also only open Monday-Friday until 7pm. I get my Adderall and mood stabilizer there.

I was finally poorly admitted by 6 pm. He didn't put the meds in and when nighttime meds came around at 8 pm, I only got zyprexa, trazadone, and ativan. I was in opiate withdrawals and they weren't willing to call the on call doctor, claiming I had to meet a doctor in person. I got a tiny bit aggressive then because I reported it and the nurse and the ER promised me they would have it ready for me.

I slept until 2 pm on Saturday. I saw the weekend psychiatrist and she forced me to start abilify, something my personal psychiatrist and I had decided to not try. My current meds were fine, I just got suicidal from a high amount of stress. I just wanted to get new coping skills with a 72 hour hold. They usually help me a lot. 

She told me that if I didn't try it, she would make sure that I was held for 2 weeks. I was supposed to be able to not take a medication but she took that away from me with that threat. I took it for the next 5 days. Every single day, including today, I haven't been able to think right or count. My other meds got fixed other than the Adderall and my Ativan got scheduled.

I was voluntarily there so I thought I could leave once I felt good but nope. They said that I could leave against medical advice. They also said that if any of us chose to leave against medical advice, they would out a 72 hour hold on us. I had to just stay o ut until Monday. The doctor and weekend social worker told me I could leave then.

Monday comes around and no one in my wing saw a doctor until 8 pm. No one saw a social worker too. Keep in mind that in my state, you have a right to see your main doctor and main social worker within 24 hours. It had been 5 days at this point. I literally talked with my doctor for 2 minutes, requesting my benzo to be PRN and to let me leave that night. He said he would talk to the social worker and that I could probably leave in the morning.

By 8 am, I finally got the papers for my discharge. 6 days later. People with actual attempts got out sooner. There were 8 of us there 'voluntarily' and we were all held for 6 days. 

We nearly had to have legal action because I was being denied my rights as a patient, threatened by nurses, and just overall mistreated. I made a great group of friends and we somehow survived the 6 days of basically no structure. The nurses always 'forgot' they had to lead a group and meals were always 30-90 minutes late.

This psych ward was a nightmare. Anyone else have an experience like this?  I've left a ton out but that's the outline of it.",10Oct2017,3
74,"I've been going to my therapist for about 6 years now, for anxiety, ocd, some depressive episodes, and self-harm. Years past I would see her twice a month, but this past year it's been once a month. It's once a month because I was a ""maintenance patient,"" one who isn't actively in a crisis.

I would have one appointment on the books for months ahead, and her assistant would find a spot for me once a month until then. I started to get worried when a month and a week went by and I heard nothing. Then two months went by. Now it's less than a week away from being three months. And I found out she only works one day a week now.

She's booked up through the end of the year, and I've been having more and more mental health issues that are getting out of control. Is she retiring and didn't tell me? Am I getting cut from her schedule because I'm ""maintenance"" and this is how she's telling me? I'm nearing a crisis, but she'd never know because I haven't been able to get in.

Should I be patient and wait a bit longer to see if her office will call me? Or do I look for another therapist, which means starting from square one, all over again? I can't see her only 4 times year! Even the therapy I would get wouldn't be effective at that rate. ",10Oct2017,1
