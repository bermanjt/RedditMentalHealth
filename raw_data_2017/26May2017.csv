0,"So about a year and a half ago, I went through a period of psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, body dysphoria, lost time, the works) for no reason that I know of. I did not see any professionals and did not tell my parents because I thought they would not believe me. It was the worst time in my life, and my stress and anxiety were ridiculous. 

I went to school and couldn't really function because my heart was pounding so much it made me weak and unable to focus. I was in and out of the quiet rooms in the counselor's office almost every day. This went on for about six months (give or take - I don't know) until it just stopped one day. I don't know why it stopped anymore than I know why it started. 

But afterwards, I had trouble dealing with the memories of what happened and all the unanswered questions it came with. I was terrified it was going to come back and wouldn't ever go away this time. That was also when I developed some serious stomach problems. I felt so sick and nauseous **all the time** but I couldn't throw up. And my stomach was in this intense and sharp pain something like twice a day at least. I saw a doctor about it, and after rotating through *so many* medications that didn't work and then a scope, biopsy, and ultrasound that all came up empty, I'm wondering if it's just the result of my stress. 

It's gone down considerably over time - I'm finally almost normal - but I do notice that it's worse on days when my feelings of anxiety and despair are worse. I have these holes in my memory. I can't retrieve memories like I used to, and I can't store memories as well as I used to. I have an eye tic that was there before the psychosis, but only very occasionally. Now it's somewhat constant and irresistible. Can a lot of stress cause something like this long term? 

Tl;dr hallucinations came and went, freaked me the heck out. I devolved memory problems and chronic nausea after the fact. Can these long term problems be the effect of stress?",26May2017,3

3,"There's just been too much going on for me to cope with right now. I'm so tired all the time, and I keep screwing up my sleep cycle because I nap and then can't fall asleep or I'm too nervous to sleep and then I oversleep the next day. I can't get it right.

Sometimes I think I'm feeling a bit better because I don't feel crushingly sad but I really just feel numb. 

I was sexually abused by my brother when I was a little kid. It was never sexual violence but he would be very violent at other times so I was very scared of him. He made me do so many fucked up things. 
But anyway, that hole situation passed, social services came in and tried to sort out the mess but my mum was so angry at me for getting my brother in trouble that I thought it was best to lie to them. I made it seem like to abuse wasn't as bad as it was. They decided it would be best if we kept living together. He was due to move out after about two years anyway for university. He didn't move out until he was 23. I left when I was 18 to go to university. I guess over time I forgave him. And mum. 
Then I found some chat logs on my dad's computer. Really vile stuff. Talking about me, sharing holiday photos of me. Discussing incest and sexual abuse with others, like it's a fetish.

I only told my mum about that a few weeks ago. She's not going to leave him, I didn't think she would. He won't tell me the whole truth about it though. I can tell he's lying or hiding something still. I'm currently on my year abroad. I've been barely able to attend anything and I really don't like it here that much, but I don't want to go to my parents house either. 

And I broke up with my boyfriend, so I don't have his home as a refuge either. 

And I'm failing my classes and nothing feels real and I can't see my therapist because the company she worked for has stopped working with my county.

I can't afford to see a psychiatrist again. The last one was not a great help. I've been on the same medication for over a year now and it's not helping any more. I can't take a higher dose though because it gives me anxiety attacks. I take beta blockers three times a day but I still have anxiety. 

I have one friend here in Russia and I can't load all this on him all the time. He does enough as it is, cooking food for me and reminding me to take my medication and helping me with classes. I don't know why he puts up with me. I can't tell if I'm depressed or lazy. I'm just sad. Sad and empty and I feel like I'm running out of directions to go in. ",26May2017,2
4,"Some background info. I've never had an eating disorder. I've always been self conciouse about my looks. Growing up I was ""too skinny"", and in ninth grade I started in antidepressants and starting gaining weight. Now I weigh 250 lbs and I hate myself. 

I try so hard to lose weight. I want to get down to 180, because that's when I thought I looked decent. But it's so hard, not just because the meds make it hard, but because I have hypothyroidism and polycystic ovarian syndrome, which both cause weight gain. I diet and exercise and everything, but the weight stays the same. It gets so bad and I get so depressed that I just want to throw up until I'm thin. My boyfriend and my mom both tell me I'm beautiful the way I am, but I mean, it's pretty much their job to make me feel good about myself. 

A few months ago I entered a severe depression, and started starving myself. I ended up losing 20 lbs over two weeks, before my group home worker and my parents got worried about me and I ended up in the hospital. They decided that treating my psychotic symptoms (I have schizoaffective disorder) would treat the depression. It worked. I started feeling good about myself. Until I got home and weighed myself, and discovered I'd put on 40 lbs. 

I just want to be beautiful! Is that too much to ask? I want to feel comfortable in my own skin! I don't want to be ashamed to show myself in public anymore! What the hell is it going to take before I can love who I am?",26May2017,5
5,"I have been struggling with sleeping for a week
After smoking weed last week's Thursday I got something like a hypoglycemic attack of sorts thing is that really scared me, 2 days later I started to feel heavyness in my heart and chills so I went to the hospital they only checked my blood pressure and run a blood and urine test and told me I was fine, gave me so pills and that night I o most managed to sleep peacefully but after that I have been only sleeping for short periods and waking up cold sweat, the thing is whenever I try to sleep I start to feel chills and that feeling keeps me awake, It's been a like 5 days since I quit weed because the doctor said stimulants are bad for me, but at this point I'm really really losing it, I tried working out, getting really tired to no avail,  my problem seems entirely psychological but doesn't matter how much I tell myself everything is fine try to sleep whenever I close my eyes the chills and fear strike me again.
I'm not sure how long can I keep going like this, it seems that what I got after smoking weed that day scared me beyond my comprehension or I just don't know anymore...

I will be in the bathroom and laugh when someone comes in. I will laugh when the teacher yells at a student. I laugh when others are in pain.

9,"So one of my coworkers who became a close friend (or I thought he was) means too much to me. We got close cause of our shared interests and we would text a lot. Play video games, hangout at work, go out to eat, hangout etc.. 

A new kid started at work and we started hanging with him too. I was sorta getting jealous so when they left me out I got mad and upset with my friend. I kinda got replaced for a bit. When I got upset about it my friend seemed to be annoyed with me. Even though he seemed to care about me more than my other friends, it's hard to describe it's just different. 

Anyways I'd get mad and ask why I didn't get invited and stuff and he'd always have some excuse. I'm pretty sure it was cause the other new guy didn't want to hangout all three of us. I was fine hanging with each of them separately and we did just that sometimes but new guy only wanted to hang with my friend by himself. It hurt to seek them together and to see my seemingly best friend replace me. Maybe I thought more of him than he did of me. It just seemed different and I know I was one of his only friends he actually hung out with on a regular basis. 

During the prime of them leaving me out my friend went about a week of mostly ignoring me and it hurt pretty bad. He later said it was cause of our last argument he was upset. The arguments always start as something so trivial and mostly cause I was being left out. I don't know it's a hard friendship to describe. I'd get mad and ask why I didn't get invited and stuff and he'd always have some excuse. I'm pretty sure it was cause the other new guy didn't want to hangout all three. I was fine hanging with each of them separately but new guy only wanted to hang with my friend by himself. 

We were all friends for a few months and then me being replaced lasted a couple months. It was the most depressed I'd ever been. Flash forward a little and the new guy at work moved a couple hours away and at the same time my friend got a GF. 

Now he is always busy with her and never has time to hangout or anything. We still text/Snapchat probably once a day and talk at work but he doesn't have time for anything. He says stuff like ""oh we should do this"" or ""oh we should do that"" but when it comes down to it we rarely do cause he's always so busy. 

Pretty much I don't have too many close friends that I felt that close to and hung out with regularly, so he meant a lot to me. I felt like I had known him way longer than I did. We bonded on a different level than my other friends and I. We have literally all the same interest and hobbies and we just get each other, or at least I thought we did. I know work friends don't mean much but we have always been more than work friends it seems. He turned into a friend that I happened to work with, not a friend from work. 

It makes me so jealous and upset when he's with his GF or he is spending time with other people at work. I used to be his go to friend now I'm kinda pushed aside. It still seems like he cares about me. I'm not gay but it's like we have a special bond. We get each other( or I thought we did) Not just some friend that I only hangout with to do a specific hobby. It's hard to explain. 

Whenever he doesn't reply(started happening when he got a GF) I get so upset. I feel incomplete without him. Like when we are together it's awesome but when we're not I wish we were hanging out most of the time. I don't know why I'm so attached to them but it's hard to explain. 

We used to kinda have a bromance going on but now he's kinda not as close with me. I feel depressed without him. We used to text a lot. Always hang together at work. If we weren't at work we'd usually be hanging together. I thought maybe we were so close is because he doesn't have all that many close friends either. We have the same small little friend group as well. However all of us don't hang all that much it's hard to get everyone together. 

It just hurts not being asked to come over, to play PlayStation, to go grab fast food, to go do something. He felt different than all my other friends and I'm alone without him.

I know him and his GF are still in the honeymoon stage cause they just started dating but he doesn't make any time for anybody but her. I don't know how to cope without. I don't know why I'm so attached but part of happiness depends on them texting me and talking to me etc.



TL;DR
Friend always busy with GF. Had a bond with him that was special. Feel depressed without their companionship. No one can fill their place. ",27May2017,2
10,"So, I started taking Abilify about a week and a half ago because I was fighting a bad case of depression. Now though I feel really high, like I can do anything and am very restless and having trouble sitting still for long periods. It's very strange to go from the low to this high. I don't think I can describe it very well. I'm just worried that it will stop sometime soon, because I don't want to go through that darkness again.

11,"I really don't know were to post this, never browsed reddit.

I had a really hard month, Citalopram started kicking in, got prescribed Methylphenidate (Ritalin) for ADHD and Quetiapine as a sleep aid and anxiety

I had a really big shock knowing that my friend had sex with my brother (the story is way more fucked up than that, but is not the point), I took a lot of Methylphenidate that night and Quetiapine later to sleep and still couldn't. I was with my friend and then is when it started, we had a full conversation for ~2 hours. The hitch is that I didn't say a single word the whole time and she responded to me thinking, I could think out loud and she heard it, nothing was hidden, I couldn't lie (exept I was able to one time by convincing myself that what I said was true, as I am a good lyer I was able to).

I'm still not sure what the f- happened, as I can't scientifically explain what happened and I am starting to doubt if any of that was real. Witch I'm sure at 85% that did happen, I contacted her again asking if she could confirm and she said she didn't remember (but that could be because we were both in shock over the situation and all).

It would really help if someone could refer me to another thread or whatever, or if someone has similar experiences. Most of the things I found on the internet are either spiritual stuff (not my thing, I am very ""to the ground"") or schizoprenic people saying ""everybody could hear me"", not the case for me since it was one-on-one telepathy, one way only.

15,"Recently ive been having massive mood swings. One minute ill be completely depressed, thinking about how much of a failure i am, how everyone is dissapointed in me, how im probably gonna die alone due to my social anxiety. Next minute im completely pissed. Yesterday i lost 100 bucks because my job fucked up with my paycheck, I have 4 shirts and a single pair of fucking pants because all the money i get just dissapears into fucking dust because of fuckups like previously mentioned and bills and food. The next minute ill go into work and ill be all happy, ill make jokes and smile the entire 4-6 hours im there and as soon as i walk into the door of my house, ill just be hit with a wave of just exhaustion, its like the 6-hours i was working i put aside all my emotions and problems, let them build up and then bam, it all comes crashing back down. Ill lay down, fall asleep, wake up, look at the group chat of my 4 friends, 3 of which barely bother with me and ill just see how all of them are doing so great in life and ill feel extremely jealous, i have to work my ass off caring for my dad whose on deaths doorstep, working a job that barely gives me hours and pays bare minimum, and all the stress of home life, sometimes going to bed hungry or struggling to make ends meet i just dropped school entirely. I have all this shit in my life, constantly stessed out and work my ass off and here go these guys with barely any worries other than college and what theyre gonna do on the weekend, here they are getting a new car or a 700 dollar laptop paid for them without a second thought or how theyre girlfriend is coming from a different state to hang out with him. And then after thinking all this ill feel like an asshole for thinking this way, for being jealous over nothing and start thinking about how shitty of a person i am and the cycle will continue. Im 18 years old with no life, im a highschool dropout with no future, it feels like nobody cares and i cant talk to anybody and i feel like ive got no right to complain. Someone has it worse out there so why should i complain? Each day just blends in with eachother, the last year has been the same thing over and over and over.

17,"I do not know if here's the place to do such things. But I do know that personnal and professionnal help has only worsened things in sight. 

I have lost faith in life. I've been wondering if it's worth it. For every nice thing there's three rotten ones. People advice to cling to the positive but I can't help it. It seems every positivity is overpriced with negative stuff and this suffices to back me off. A reward is not sufficient to make me forget what I had to do to get it AND shut up about enduring stuff. Some tell me to engage in situations where the work itself is a reward.... i wish things were that simple. 

It seems like negativity is self generated. Death comes more naturally than life. You do nothing and the outcome is most likely degradation. In nature, there are those who prey and those who are hunted. It's not fair; one must die so the other lives and so on. You have to work against the natural state of nature to survive, improve or have fun. 

The bottom line is always to change your perception and so on. But perception is just as much influenced by its stimuli as the stimuli are by our perception. I do not want to submit to all this injustice I perceive because doing nothing about it would be a form of submission and agreement to a dark vision of life. Negativity and injustice would get away with murder just because of philiosophical B.S and my lack of confidence in my own beliefs due to the eternal doubt. Yeah I'm probably some fundamentalist. 

Now let's get to the personal drama (spoilers,it's not very dramatic). I've been struggling to find summer jobs because I am on tour and have many odd engagements this summer. At first I tried honesty but it didn't work. The employers didn't care about me being honest enough to explain the situation and show them what's going on. Nobody does that and it should have proven something. If not for reality for karma itself, goddammit! Then goes the other side of the fence telling you to understand their p.o.v. but i do. That's why i didn't want to bail them at the last second ""oops, i have to leave, goodbye and sent me the last paycheck!"". In the end, me being comprehensive of the situation and trying solutions gets me unemployed. It doesnt make sense. 

 I usually find myself trapped between two engagements and i absolutely hate that everytime, people blame me to fail them. They don't overdo it, but I can't forgive them for not seeing that i'm trying to compromise/am stuck with duality. I'm even madder that they don't want to know why I am struggling in the first place. 

I am heading towards failure as I study music. The point is already made here. Sucks because so far I told myself to keep going on since I was good at it (most aspects altogether). The more it goes, the more I realise being good isn't sufficient; being excellent at least is required. I don't have the energy at this moment to self-sacrifice everything for something that may or may not happen and be at the best enough to scrap a living. How can you live such kind of life when there's so much of the good stuff out there like movies and wonders of the world or society? But again, you gotta pay for it in money,time or energy. 

You can't enjoy things to the fullest. If you eat too much you get fat. If you love too much you scare people off and they hurt you. The fact that everything is about balance is torture. Why do you have to stop reaching for pleasure? It doesn't make sense. Hapiness IS hapiness, balance isn't and i believe is falsely thought so to make us forget the limits are for good things as well. There shouldn't be any barriers in life; there should only be lifebuoys. 

And there goes that arrogant smile they give you, this forsaken ""c'est la vie"" for those who have given up and merely adapted. But folks, it's not about what it is; it's about what It could/should be. 

And it's even more disgusting to say that since everyone's different, there ought to be some drawn line. If it were for me, there wouldn't be many directions to begin with, only morality and everyone's willingness to understand each other. Oh yeah, everyone's perception makes this ambiguous but some things speak up for themselves like this whole thing about personnal developpment and individualism being quoted in opposition to the search of approval/help from others. Just the fact thatI'm constantly double checking and criticising my own thoughts makes me confortable thinking of what people's values say of them. 

Yeah I know it's pretty vague and filled with contradictions.",27May2017,2

Apparently I am stupid because I am a nerd, but I don't care about being a nerd or standing out. I just enjoy being me. I'm 'childish' because I had no childhood. I had an abusive one, to the extent that I am amnesiac about it.

My parents blamed the anger on autism and had me sent to a school for dull people, where I was bullied even more severely, because I stuck out like a sore thumb. They also blamed my vegetarianism/aversion to meat on me being stupid, when it's really because I'm a Buddhist.

Anyone who has taken psychedelics can take this survey. Though this survey focuses on OCD, I am interested in mental health in larger terms as well.

The data from this survey will factor into my final deliverables: two books, which will 1. define OCD (working to dispel rampant misconceptions of the disorder) and 2. suggest mechanisms for coping with the disorder / mitigating its symptoms. Recent research in the field of psychedelic study has suggested that there is a correlation between [the consumption of psychedelics and the reduction of the symptoms of OCD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17196053?dopt=AbstractPlus). However, not everyone will have positive experiences with psychedelics, and this fact is particularly important when mental health is concerned. I am looking for case studies as well as survey participants. If you have OCD and have experience with psychedelics and are open to discussing this in greater detail, please send me a message!

To maintain privacy, I will not be collecting any data which would identify test takers, unless you choose to leave your contact information at the end of the survey.

I am conducting research and creating this project myself, for my final capstone project at the school of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning at the University of Cincinnati (That's a mouthful. It's usually just called DAAP).

Three and a half years ago, I dropped out of undergrad in my senior year due to debilitating anxiety and depression. When I dropped out I entered a Partial Hospitalization Program, received Electro-Convulsive Therapy, and then went inpatient.  Ever since I left the inpatient program, I have been in therapy.  
  
Recovery has not been linear. I have uncovered so many hard things to confront. I have experienced major setbacks like divorce, assault, and religious trauma. I went back to an Intensive Outpatient Program once, but for the most part, regular therapy and medication have sufficed.  
  
In this process of recovery, my strategy has been to continually look for the next rung on the ladder: the next flaw to improve. Maybe that's because I am a pessimist, I don't know. I keep finding things to fix.  
  
My withdrawal from college completely eradicated my confidence in terms of what I think I can handle. With my confidence went my ambition. Sure, I like myself now--a major difference from before.

32,"Hi,
A friend of mine has been struggling for about a year with her mental illness. She's had to move away and my only contact us via text and odd phone call. Much as I want to see her, she seems a little hesitant. 

So I'm doing my best to support her in the limited way I can. Texts and calls are infrequent, but when they do happen, I try to do my best to be normal, not to treat her differently because of the mental health issue. 

I may be reading too much into it, but I get the impression that asking ""How are you?"" Is a stupid question. There could be a million reasons she doesn't reply, but I wonder if me asking it is fairly tantamount to reminding her how bad a day it's been with panic, voices, etc. 

But I don't know what else to say. I can tell her about my day, but I want to know about her, how she's doing, what she has been up to, how she is coping. She had a meeting yesterday with various workers, and I've asked a few times how it went and had nothing. So I guess there are topics she doesn't want to discuss (whether it's just with me or with anyone). 

But I need the right sort of questions to poke at her to get a response. 

Thanks for any help.",27May2017,2
33,"I've never quite understood what anxiety is outside of general nervousness or apprehension and that everyone's anxiety is different. It's that I don't believe that it exists or that people are faking it; I just want to be able to fully sympathize with someone if they express that they have it. 
This leads to my second question:Do I have anxiety? I like to think of myself as an extroverted introvert who wants to go out and hang out with people but I've noticed within the past year or so that whenever I go out for longer than 2 hours, I just sort of shut down and don't really want to talk to people. I'll exclude myself from conversation, play on my phone (not if someone is speaking directly to me of course but when I'm in a car or a bust restaurant, etc.), and sometimes even get irritable. This happens even with my closest friends that I spend the most time with. Is this just my personality, or is anxiety or something else?
Thanks!",27May2017,1
