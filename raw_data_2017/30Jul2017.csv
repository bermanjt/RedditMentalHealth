1,"Smoking weed doesn't increase my appetite anymore. All food makes me want to be sick (and a lot of times I end up throwing it up anyway), so I try and at least fill my stomach up with crackers and green juice. Which is obviously not a great solution. I've lost about 20 pounds in the past few months and I've always been skinny, so this is alarming. Not to mention the weakness and dizzy spells that come along with it. Sometimes I manage one or two small meals a day, but other times I go days without remembering to eat which definitely comes at a physical price (and a monetary one, I got sent home from my serving job today because I looked too weak to work). To be clear: I am NOT anorexic or bulimic. At least not on purpose. I don't want this. I don't want to lose weight. But anxiety makes me throw up and eating does, too, unless I can lie down right after. 

So, please, if you've ever gone through this, I would love any advice you can give. Thank you.",30Jul2017,1,

8,"So I was dealing with a ton of health things at once and I ended up clogging my ear and cause myself to be potassium deficient in one week, this was extremely stressful because as I tend to be quite the hypochondriac (I am healthy now) I started experiencing some visual perception issues. I was stressing everyday extremely (to the point where i thought I wasn't going to wake up the next day.)  It started off as being hard to read because when I would look at a word, the half the word would tend to shit up and down. I went to the eye doctor and they said it would be more of a perception problem than an eye problem. So now I am curious, what types of things can cause visual perception issues? It's getting hard to read and things seem to get kinda almost washy and wavy (almost like a form of vertigo). Could ear blockage cause it? If its just stress, will this go away with time? I could use some direction and any knowledge I would appreciate.",30Jul2017,1,
9,"Hey, guys...I'm wondering if you could give me some advice. This is kind of long, so I apologize in advance.

I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend going on 4 years now. We both have some mental health issues (I suffer from a lot of trauma-related stuff, he has more general anxiety and depression) and, while he's able to help me when I'm not feeling my best, I've always found it hard to support him and help him in a way that actually works.

A recent example of this is that we both went to a wedding. Before we arrived, my boyfriend had a few ""I'm not really a wedding reception/party person"" comments, I didn't really think anything of them because he's not really too into dancing or drinking and I thought that was why. However, once the reception kicked off, I noticed he was increasingly looking more and more distant as the night went on until he just looked incredibly tired and sad. I tried to pull him aside a few times and check in with him, and he told me that for some reason, he felt anxious. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he said that ""there's nothing really to say about it."" I tried asking him if there's anything I could do to help, and he said no.

Further on in the night, he told me he felt like he had been having a few panic attacks, so I offered to walk with him to get away from the crowd and the noise. We did, and he was just dead silent and distant. He tends to really, really pull away when he's anxious, and I can't really do anything to snap him out of it. I try to: I goof around a little, smile, try to talk about other things, but eventually he goes back to being distant. I tried to talk to him about the situation and he became a bit impatient/standoffish, again saying he has nothing to say about it and my attempts at talking to him about things made him feel like I was treating him like a child. 

At this point, the wedding had been going on for around 5 hours, and I had seen my boyfriend pull more and more away. He'd been standoffish a few times earlier, I was sad and frustrated with myself for not being able to substantially help him, and I was hurt that he took my attempts to ground him as a way to infantilize him. I said (and immediately regretted) ""Maybe this is a sign that you should be on medication."" I felt like shit, but a part of me believes that medication will help him feel much better. I know I can't make him choose to take medication, though, so I apologized and didn't bring it up again.

We eventually talked things out on the drive home, but I still feel like I'm no better at being able to help him. He's always able to ground me and make me feel safe and I hate that I can't do it for him. I don't want to coddle him (or make him feel coddled), but I feel incredibly hurt when I see him hurting. I don't want to leave him by himself to have panic attacks while I try to dance and have fun. 

I'm so lost and I feel so heartbroken that I can't help the person I deeply, deeply love. Does anyone have any advice on helping loved ones with anxiety? ",30Jul2017,4,
10,"It happens every year at this time. She starts acting weird and saying things that don't make sense. It's getting worse every year. This year she keeps running away when we try to help her. She's been to countless psych hospitals and she always resists treatment. If you try to talk to her about it she cracks and has another episode. I do not know what to do she will not take medication or seek treatment or even admit that anything is wrong with her. She refuses evaluation, hospitals, medicatoon, and even talking about it. She flew to California and was roaming the streets of LA losing her mind. We are out of options she is a danger to herself but even if we took her to a psych hospital it wouldn't be useful because she would just stop taking the medication as soon as she is out. And I want to emphasise that trying to help her makes her worse. Me and my family do not know what to do anymore",30Jul2017,1,

But I also read that it has something to do with ones mother. Our mom was caring for most of our lives up until 2015 when she left my dad and began seeing her boyfriend. When that started, she would constantly leave us alone, go to work and from there to his house, and sometimes not even come home. She always says how she just wants to run away from us and always tells us shes tired of us. In a way I think my brother hates her for that. Is this misogyny??",30Jul2017,2,

22,"I live with my girlfriend and we've been together for a good while now, but I feel that every day I become more and more anxious because I'm going into therapy for anxiety and now I think I might have anger management issues. I feel very anxious because I'm afraid of my future because she also suffers from multiple mental disorders and thus she does not have the capacity to help me as much as she wants to.

I also feel this incredible guilt for having (or even thinking about having) mental health issues; that I somehow worsen her and her mental health (I would like to point out that she does not do this to me, it's me and only me that have this guilt). I'm also afraid of leaving her because of our mental health, because I think she might commit suicide (she've had several suicidal episodes in the past). I feel so much guilt for so many things and it feels like my therapy session (which is in Sept) is light years away. It also feels like I don't deserve help in any way, shape or form; I'm afraid that they'll say there's nothing wrong with me and that I have to live this way for the rest of my life.

I'm also afraid that they won't take me seriously because I'm not good at explaining what I mean and that I think I might be an hypochondriac. I feel like a failure at many places in life because I just can't understand what I want to understand and that tears very much at my mental health.

I say likely anger management issues because when I'm stressed and hear unnecassary sounds (our landlords children running upstairs etc), I can feel my blood boil. Or when someone disagrees with me or is stressed themselves, I feel the need to punch something (though I've never hurt anyone physically, only due to great constraint)

I feel a little lost, life didn't go the way I had planned for so many years and I feel guilt for wanting to study in another city/country (which I could never do because of guilt). I feel guilt just for hanging out with other people, because she is struggling with doing that because of her social anxiety and she seems very sad about it all.

Does anyone have any tips? Thanks",30Jul2017,1,
23,"Hi there,

I'm a 35 y/o male who has experienced being an ""outcast"" and being bullied for most of my life to some degree. It's still happening now in the job I've been at for more than 7 years. I'm working at turning my life around in other ways (addiction, mental health issues, debt, lots of bad habits in how I think, speak act) but this bullying stuff is one major impediment to progress. 

I am hyper sensitive and have very low self esteem. It's so easy for me to undermine myself and talk poorly of myself just as a reflex and this attitude and ""frequency"" is like blood in the water to bullies. Add to this the fact that I am often forgetful and depressed and seem to screw up and make a fool of myself even when I'm trying my hardest and just simply ""doing my best and not being bothered by the bullies"" is insanely difficult because I am giving fuel to the fire. Even good people react to my screw ups in ways that trigger my low self esteem and so I constantly feel wounded, on edge, not good enough, and as a result of my constantly frustrated efforts, very, very angry.

The main point of this post is that I want the bullying at my main job to stop. I can't leave because I'm trying to pay off debt and to leave this job in this economy would be the dumbest thing I could do. I'll only be there another year or so until I'm in a better financial situation, but still need to put up with the a**holes there in the meantime. 

I try to focus on my goals as much as possible when the bullying gets me down. I try to stand up for myself whenever possible as well. I've actually ""bared my teeth"" (figuratively speaking of course!) and gotten ""them"" off my back at times. But the thing is, my default state is kinda bumbling, people pleasing, timid, and loose lipped. I tend to get nervous around the bully types and lose control of my tongue and say stupid things. I know that this is no excuse and I'm trying to force myself to create a habit of always being mindful of what I say, and I would say I'm making some progress, but it's a tough nut to crack. 

The bullying comes from a few main people, one of whom is above me in terms of their authority and position, but the other two are in the same role as me. Their are a couple more but they are more like ""flying monkeys"" and don't bother me as much. 
But some of the bullying has given me PTSD symptoms. Whenever I think about the abuse, about specific incidents, my heart rate is jacked up, I get viciously angry and scared, and thoughts of how defective and weak and weird I am fill my head and a sense of hopelessness overcomes me about the world and my ability to thrive in it. It's insane how I can let a couple people who I have no respect for and who I know are really just sad, scared, ignorant d-bags affect me so much. I've been ""sick of it"" for years but never took action for some reason. But I've had enough. I'm uprooting the weeds in my life and this is one of them.

I recently told my direct supervisor about this because he is a good man and is good to me. He sounded very supportive and offered to talk to them each individually to make sure it stops.

I was hesitant to go this route because of the reaction it might provoke in the aggressors and because I figured that they would just continue their tactics but be more covert about it than usual. Also I've been hesitant because I don't want to rock the boat since I already feel like a burden for having utilized my companies support for addiction treatment and counselling twice.
Also, I have been hesitant to create this conflict because it means that I have to be 100% aware of how I comport myself around them at all times. No more thoughtless, self sabotaging ""nice guy"" reactions when I see them (even though they've hurt me deeply and I hate them, when I see them I revert back to my submissive, people pleasing role and act friendly to them, which usually gives them some kind of ammo.). I've really been working at being mindful of my reactions to them so that I don't give them ammo and so they know we are not friends, but it's so exhausting and difficult to always have to be ""on guard"" like this.

Luckily I don't have to see them for very long each day, and not even necessarily every day (except one who I see briefly almost every day).

Anyway, I am sick of being retraumatized by my own thoughts when I'm not at work, I'm sick of feeling unsafe and unwelcome at my job, I'm sick of giving up my power to people who are too stupid, too sick, too pathetic to see that they are really just jealous of me and uncomfortable with the thoughts and feelings that I inspire in them. They really are pathetic, sad little humans and it drives me nuts to think I validate their childish bullshit behavior.

33,"So just a little bit of background info. I have severe trauma because I was sexually abused/molested hundreds of times from early childhood to my sophomore year of high school. The vast majority of it occurred during 7-9th grade. 
I have abusive parents but it's not something I can get out of. Most of the abuse is emotional and any sort of physical abuse is rare, mild, and would be something that CPS would 100% gloss over. However, there is a fair deal of neglect. My family also enabled my sexual abuse to occur and refuses to allow me to report it which means that there are several sexual predators that are my age wandering around my town taking advantage of other girls. And I have 100% confirmation that they have sexually abused other girls. I've talked to several other victims. 
I regularly interact with the people who hurt me. Trust me, I wish this was as simple as reporting the sexual perpetrators and my parents but it is not. I've looked into it and I wish I could. 
Countless other issues have spawned out of this. So bad to the point where I am unable to recount even the least of it so I won't even try because it would be as long as a novel. Just know that it is terrifying to live the life I do. 
I don't have access to therapy, but after doing research, i can safely say that I AT THE VERY LEAST demonstrate symptoms (I'm not saying I have these disorders but my god if I don't at least have a few of them I would be shocked) of people with borderline personality disorder, ptsd, depression, panic disorder, paranoia, binge eating disorder. 
Ever since I found out that suicide and self harm existed in middle school, I wanted to take part in both of those behaviors. I didn't know why back then though. 
It wasn't until my sophomore year when I realized that I was being abused in and outside of the home.
I somehow survived high school and graduated this June, thank god. I am strong. I am a fighter. 
I turn 18 in October and I leave for college this August. I don't know if I want to go to college but it's a long story and I don't really have a choice. Trust me, I've explored alternative options but at the very least I'll be away from this town full of psychopaths and manipulators. But for now, I'm still here. And don't get me wrong, I have a few friends that care. Not every single person is evil in this town, but there's enough in my close social circle that it's overbearing and terrifying. As of last year, I found people who care for me and ever since then I am rich in companionship. But that can't fix everything. 
I haven't told anyone that after years of resisting the urge to self harm, I succumbed. I mean there's one friend that knows I get urges but I don't count that because she doesn't know how bad it actually is. 
Strangely, my life is the best it's ever been but for some reason my will power ran out and now, lashing out on myself is addicting, especially when I have no control over a situation. 
What I want to do is pull my hair out, bang my head against the wall really hard so it causes brain damage, and scratch my arms. Thankfully, I've stopped pulling my hair and banging my head. I know that scratching up your arms and legs is still horrible, but it is mild compared to other types of self harm. I have only broken skin twice, the most recent having been a few weeks ago and I think I'll have that scar for the rest of my life. And honestly, as horrible as this is to say, if scratching up my arms prevents me from banging my head and damaging my brain forever, I rather this option. That's not to say I'm settling for this, but it is saying it's much safer than banging my head and won't cause permanent damage. When I want to self harm, I lose control. I want to self harm and kill myself multiple times a day, nearly every day. Sometimes it doesn't go away for the entire day and it's almost all I think about. 
2 days ago, while hanging out with a new friend who is easily one of the most caring and considerate people I've ever had in my life, I had a sudden mood swing (ones that are like the one I have are common amongst people with borderline personality disorder) in mid conversation. Because he's so amazing, he brought me joy and laughter just by being himself 30 minutes after the depression hit.  He's an absolutely remarkable human being and I don't think anyone has ever been able to demonstrate this level of understanding and compassion in such a short time, or ever really. We have only been friends for two weeks and already he's changed me. I mentioned that I felt weird and he asked why with concern in his voice, but I wouldn't tell him the specifics. He doesn't know about my history with trauma and abuse yet. I'm not ready to tell him. He knows I have had a hard time and get scared and paranoid and anxious very often, but that's it. If he did know, he would not look at me different and he would actually know just what to say. He would not run away because he cares and I cannot stress how thankful I am to have someone like him in my life as well as other amazing people as well. But I'm not ready to talk to him about this. He respects my decision to be vague, which is wonderful. Anyway, this isn't about him, I digress. I'm just very thankful to have the life that I do.  
I've never told anybody about my self harm problem because it's likely that a well-intentioned friend will report it because they would fail to understand that if my family finds out about how horrible my mental state truly is, everything will get worse. As much as I have love for this friend of mine and my other friends, I'm not ready to tell him. And ever since that sudden mood change 2 days ago, i have had the urge to hurt and kill myself almost nonstop. The depression I'm feeling is unreal. I am struggling to combat this pain and though I have good friends, few of them live near me and most are unavailable. Ive looked it up, and severe depressive mood swings like this are very common in people with borderline personality disorder, and they last anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. I'm on day 3 of it now. 
I have resisted the urge to self harm all but one time aside from today. My parents were being horrible immediately after I woke up and I failed to resist the urge twice. And after I hurt myself both times, I didn't lose the urge to do it again and feel sad apologetic towards myself like I usually do. Usually, I cry a little bit and kiss the place I hurt and show myself love the best that I can. 
Instead, I just wanted to keep going. Since then, I went to an event with family friends who are also bad people. I mean, they are friends with my parents, so...
I am there currently and I have resisted the urge to hurt myself countless times but I've also given in about several times, not sure how many since I've lost count. It's not bad , my legs and arms are just a bit scratched up and sting but it is terrifying. I want to stop. I am doing my best to actively combat this problem but I'm struggling and I worry that I'm losing. I'm also emotionally eating and I'm finding it nearly impossible to stop doing it today and the last few days. My stomach feels bad but I'm still holding myself back from shoveling more potato chips in my mouth. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm going to make it through this dark period of my life. For crying out loud, the worst is over. I don't get physically and sexually assaulted on the regular and I somehow made it through high school without killing myself or getting killed. I am a lot better with binging than I've ever been and I'm 25 pounds down from my heaviest weight with the weight of the muscle I've gained added on in that time. Sometimes I go days without wanting to hurt or kill myself, and it feels like a dream. One time a while back, I went a whole 2 months. I want to get back to that point again. Or at least to the point where half of my day is not infested with me doing everything I can to prevent myself from ending my own life. 
I have the opportunity to pursue my passions so much more than I used to and because of this there are a few times a week where I do what I love and I forget about all of the pain and suffering for 1-2 hours. I have a job so I'm making money, albeit I'm making next to nothing but at least it's something. And Jesus fuck, I am performing at Madison square garden with some of my best friends in a few weeks. I'm so lucky!
If I survive this, a few years from now, I have big opportunities waiting for me that I don't want to delve into, maybe even bigger than the performance I have coming up at Madison square garden, and god knows how many more will pop up during the four years I'm away at college. I will never kill myself, no matter how much I want to. I've resisted the urge so many times where I had so much more of a reason to end my life than I do now. But that does not discount the fact that even though comparatively, life is good, my existence is still infested with pain and agony. 
I've experienced the highest highs and the lowest lows. One day I'm going to somehow get my life story out there, but in this moment, im still in the middle of it. 
This very second, I am trying to stop hurting myself and it's not working. I wish it would, but it's not. The only thing that has distracted me is taking the time to write this out. And it's actually helped a lot. 
Some friendly encouragement and advice would be appreciated. Even if it's just ""I believe in you!"" I'm not expecting you to completely fix everything through a comment. I just need some help tiding myself over until life gets more bearable. 
Maybe it will help me through the day, week, month, year, or even just the moment. 
Much love, and thank you for hearing my story. 
Edit: I just finished writing this post and it's kind of funny because one of the family's friends just walked in the room and began to rant to me about how selfish and cowardly people who kill themselves are. She doesn't know about my situation, but it's just a funny coincidence. Don't worry, it didn't hurt my feelings. I have a good sense of humor about this stuff.

38,"EDIT: Should probably add I'm in the UK.

I started (and ended) CBT some months ago. I was only allotted a block of 3 hours in total, split into 30 minute sessions.
I don't think either of these limits were helpful, as they added pressure and anxiety to the whole situation.

The therapist did a lot to let me take the lead and decide on my own treatment, and while I appreciated that, I was only there because I didn't know what to do. While I don't think he should have just dragged me where he thought was best, I would have appreciated a guiding hand (or at least a couple of fingers).

In particular, when asked to define what I considered to be my main problem, I simply spewed out every issue I could think of.
Depression, anxiety, insecurity, social ineptitude, low self-esteem and probably several things more. I didn't know, nor did I receive any indication, if this was a an appropriate problem-scope for only 3 hours of therapy. In hindsight, I can say with confidence that it was too much and too broad, and could well have been better had I been more specific.

In general, in fact, I found myself rambling a lot, I tried to make notes to help me but it was difficult to plan what to talk about before sessions.

The therapist gave me exercises to do, mostly written exercises and recording my thoughts and behaviours. I think a lot of these were good and some of them really helped (others didn't more on that shortly). What I thought less of was the stream of published self-help material that came my way. I tried that sort of thing before coming to therapy and it didn't do much, I got a therapist because I felt that doing things by myself wasn't helping.

The plurality (possibly even majority) of the 3 hours was given over to anxiety, and I saw a reasonable improvement in that area.
It was the anxiety related exercises that worked the best because we had time to practise them together and iterate (analyse my work and point out ways to improve in subsequent sessions). I think having more 1-1 time in general would have helped.

Being honest, though, I feel I could have tried harder with the exercises that we didn't have time to go through together (mostly focused on depression, low self-esteem and other delightful members of that family). I felt a little out of my depth, but I could have kept them up for longer even without feedback. I feel it is likely that I went to therapy for someone to talk to, rather than the exercises.

I feel I've focused a lot on the negative here, so I should also say that I feel it was helpful overall, especially with anxiety and that I do not regret going. I want to know, though, if these are typical experiences and if I can find better ones... or at least, a paradigm that suits me better.

Thanks if you got this far :)

TLDR: Went to CBT, felt there wasn't enough time and that I didn't get enough done. Also felt that there wasn't enough of a 1-1 process.",30Jul2017,3,
39,"I have been struggling with mental health for countless years, this is me wanting to reach out to others and show them that they are not alone. I may not be an expert in mental health, but do not be scared to reach out and have a talk with me I will always be here to talk. I have created a blog for others to read about my struggle, and would love others stories and issues. I would love to build a community where everyone feels open to talk.

40,"I need help. I need to find a family therapist, but my family's situation is very specific. Are there any search tools I can use to find therapists in my area based on certain specific criteria? Also, will we actually have to pay for a first session to get a sense of what each therapist is like, or is it possible to ask them a few questions (via email or over the phone) as a sort of vetting process beforehand? Like I said, I have a very specific type of clinician in mind that we need. ",30Jul2017,3,

42,"I posted something similar on r/sociopath (even phrased it as a discussion rather than advice post) but it got deleted.

I believe my ex is a sociopath. Yesterday he threatened me and then I threatened him back and he got very bad. He is now threatening the wellbeing of me and my family (primarily in the form of revenge porn, he believes it will ruin my life and disgrace them). 

My question is, do sociopaths usually follow up on their threats or is he just trying to scare me so I'll fuck off?

I'm reluctant to get authorities involved because I think any contact or intervention would just aggravate him more. ",30Jul2017,2,
43,"I'm really struggling lately. I can't tell if the voice in my head is just my self-talk or if it is ""voices"". It just gets really distracting and I can't focus on anything and it's exhausting. I feel like I have to constantly argue with it in my head. ""No, I'm not a terrible person,"" ""no, I don't suck at my job"" ""no, I don't actually wanna bash my head against a wall"" and on and on and on. It's relentless and I don't feel like I am in control of it any more.",30Jul2017,3,

45,"I have been living in a small house with my mom,dad,little brother. I am a 15 year old boy. Throughout our time living here me and my family have been noticing strange things. Our neighbors have been freaking us out to put it softly. The woman and man next door both live together it looks like but somethings off. Whenever their garage is open and the man is there all he does is stare and never says hi or anything. Meanwhile the woman has shown more ""aggresive signs"". The woman never says hi or anything as well. She just stares . Me and my little went to her house for halloween and she seemed fine. But she sometimes blasts her music at night for hours and its the same song over and over again. And just today I thought id ask for help. My parents came home from the grocery store and the lady came out from here garage and started recording my parents and their car. My parents would say ""hello"", ""hi"", ""what are you doing"" and she didnt respond. She went around the car and just recorded a video without saying anything and and then ran inside. I really need help and dont now what subreddit to put this on. This is freaking my family out and we fear that it may get worse. Please and thank you.",30Jul2017,1,

50,"(Trigger warning for sexual abuse) 
Hello all, so bear with me here

About 6 months ago I had a sexual innaporporiate intrusive thought involving my younger brother. I went into a panic and started obbsessing over it trying to remeber what really happened. 
A few days later I finally told my bf and stsrted sobbing/panicking again. I smoked some weed hoping it would help (now I realize it probably mad it worse) 

Now on the daily I think everything has to do with me touching or molesting my younger brother. Anything he does or says i find a way to relate. 

I feel conviced its part of some repressed memory, and that he may have some repressed memories too of it.  

Hes had issues going to the bathroom/soiling himself for a long time now and Im horrified its my fault. Although hes alwaus trying to hang out with me/os affectionate. 

My bf says theres no way I would of done anything bad or stupid like that when I was younger but I just dont know. 

Is this a delusion?? I also get anxious/paranoid that people are looking at me and it causes me to feeze up. 

Is this anxiety, delusions, could I really have done something innaporporiate  (it often feels like I did even though I have no clear memory) ",30Jul2017,2,
