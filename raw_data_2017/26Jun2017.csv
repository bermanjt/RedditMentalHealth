I think i have a lot of unresolved issues. I have a profound hatred for myself.I have an uneasy relationship with my father. I don't relate to any of my family and find it impossible to talk to them. I'm very bad at building relationships with new people and as a consequence I am a 20 year old with only about 2 friends and a very bad history with girls. I consistently push people away and im a failure academically. I'm so so lonely and I drink daily in order to cope, at the moment I stay without in RDA but i really think im in danger of becoming dependant on it. I really just want end it all but im too much of a spineless coward to do it

I know i need help but im too scared to go too the doctor to get help

1,"Hey, this is my first post on this subreddit.
I'm 18 [M] from England. I have been struggling with myself for the past 3 years but recently it's been worse. 

The reason why I came here is because I am very depressed and existential. I've tried counselling etc but I think it would be nicer to chat to people because they want to, not as a job. 

I know I'm young but every day I wake up thinking about what I'm gonna do and achieve. But I never feel like I achieve anything. I stay fit, eat well and go to the gym 4 times a week. I'm trying my best to make sure im fine. At college/high-school I had friends, a girlfriend and all was well. These past couple years it's been the opposite. She cheated on me and I have no friends. No one. I mean I have brothers who I love and treat as best mates but... I'm just a lonely depressed guy and I hate it. 

I suffer from social anxiety so I find it hard to interact, so I think trying to make friends is off the list. I just want to know why I'm alive on this earth. Why do you people work everyday just to one day die. I hate it. I don't want to be on this earth anymore. 

I want to be loved by a girl. I want a relationship, I need to feel the presence of someone who cares for me. Going to sleep next to someone who I know is meant for me would feel like a cure in itself. I don't even know what I'm saying. I'm not going to help myself like this am I. 

I guess this post is just getting stuff off my chest to people who also sit in front of technology typing their lives away. Sorry if I'm sounding disrespectful... I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm lost and I need someone :(

3,"Hello /r/mentalhealth,

I'm in an entirely new situation for me. I've been seeing a girl for a few weeks now and really like her, and she has what I'd consider above-average (in severity) depression. 

I've been involved in mental health counseling from a volunteer standpoint, but I find it difficult shifting from the role of ""counselor"" to the role of supportive partner, as well as navigating all the intricacies and nuances that come with dating someone with depression.

Chiefly, the issue so far has been a lack of interest in opening up to me about what's going on and how I can support her. I've been more than open about my willingness to understand and support but for the most part I've been shut down. 

I also never know what is her not wanting to do something, and what is her depression basically telling her not to go do something (I hope that makes sense). 

Is this something that takes time that I should just wait out? I like her a lot but nobody can wait forever. I'm really at an impasse because she doesn't seem open to discussing anything about it (I assume, from previous conversations with her, that she's afraid of scaring me off). 

I love you all and thank you for the help!",26Jun2017,1
4,"This is probably a very silly question. I've been having a very rough time for the past few months, and today I just kind of realized that I can't wait until school starts to see someone. Being home means that I have transportation and can therefore see someone who will give me a diagnosis. (I have gone to a semester of counseling at university and tried to figure it out there, but from my understanding, the only way I could see anyone who would diagnose me was to contact the school of psychology and ask to be a participant in a program where grad students take real people's symptoms and diagnose them. There's a long waiting list. I didn't do it.)

I don't know how long it takes to get a diagnosis or if one profession sees you sooner than another. I need this to happen before I go back to university so that I can get the disability card that I need.

Therapy itself isn't important to me. I've gone to counseling, when my problems were of present situations, and it didn't help.

Medication is more important to me. Anxiety and depression have been ruining my life for years, and I need at least the possibility of having some relief.

I also have to do everything pretty much on my own, as the only parent that is home has English as a second language and her only experience with the mental health profession was taking my brother to therapy for a few months 10-11 years ago. I have anxiety about this as well, because phone anxiety prevents me from picking up my phone when people call and, when I am on the phone, having an anxiety attack that I have to talk through.

In conclusion, the questions I'm asking are basically:

- I need a diagnosis, don't need therapy, would like medication. Should I see a psychiatrist directly? Is there another route that I should take that would be quicker? Or is this too short of a time period and I should give up?

- Are there any resources that could explain the process to me in more detail?",26Jun2017,1

7,"I've been on Lexapro (20mg) and Wellbutrin (159mg) for well over three years. I was recently diagnosed that I fall on the bipolar spectrum so I'm now on Lamotrigine (100mg) for about the past four months. It's helped some.

9,"I am a 19 year old college student and I am beginning to see clear signs of some sort of mental illness. Never really had problems when I was younger other than temper tantrums, and anger issues that my parents assumed were nothing out of the normal. As I have begun college, however, I have noticed numerous metal issues that have completely changed my life, and ruined countless relationships with people that I love. This is really hard to put into words but I'll try my best.
- I have trust issues that have caused me to abuse my girlfriends, and have only had relationships that have been toxic as a result
- I constantly think everyone is judging me. For example, if I see two people talking and I make eye contact, I assume they are talking about me in a negative way for some reason.
- I have had 3 episodes where I cut myself but I honestly don't know why. I was drunk during each occasion, felt sad, and for some reason felt like hurting myself. 
- I have really really bad short term memory loss and constantly lose things. Have lost my wallet 6 times this year. In previous years, I was always good about keeping track of my stuff. Now I will do things like set my phone down, walk away, then immediately forget where it was. 
- I'm socially awkward, and get incredibly nervous when talking to girls. Not sure if this is a sign of anything but it is an issue.
- I have noticed that it is very hard for me to keep eye contact when talking to someone.
- I have trouble sleeping, and can only really get a good night sleep when I drink, smoke weed, or take xanax before bed. 
- Feel like my mind is all over the place and have a hard time focusing on school work. This has not been an issue until college.

I am seeing a doctor tomorrow to get a real diagnosis tomorrow because something really bad happened last night. I took half of a bar of xanax, drank a lot at the pool and from then I blacked out. From what my friends told me is that I got dropped off, and for some reason got in a fight with my neighbor who proceeded to punch me after I approached him for whatever reason. I then went inside, took a shower, fell down in the shower and hit my head on the wall of the tile which made a hole. Then I came out of the shower and for some reason thought it was a good idea to go to my neighbor with a knife. Nothing happened, but they called the cops and then I ending up going back into my house, cutting my self with the knife, and took every drug that I had (.2 g of molly and 4 bars of xanax) in an attempt to kill my self because I was sad. I have never in my life acted like this before. Although I am socially awkward, I do have a lot of friends who can attest that I am not violent at all, and am an incredibly nice person as I always try to put others before myself. They will tell you I'm a perfectionist as I want to do the best at everything I do. But when I'm drunk or by myself I feel so lonely and sad. I know I am depressed, but my manic outbursts of anger make me think I am dealing with more than just depression. My family does have a history of depression, but I feel as if I have a much bigger issue. Can anyone relate to this at all, and maybe give me an idea of whats wrong with me?",26Jun2017,1

11,"So my neighbor has been acting pretty crazy lately. I'm sorry if that sounds offensive. But he has been. The guy was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. I think he was diagnosed like around 2 years ago, but i'm not totally sure. Either way he's been dealing with it for not a long time. About a year ago he came to my door and was telling all kinds of crazy things. He was accusing me of yelling into his window every morning, and yelling at him whenever he walked by my apartment etc. I don't even know or talk to this guy. My family and I have been living here for over 10 years but we were never friends with him or his family. Occasionally my mom would talk to his mom but nothing else. 

Basically for about a year he's been harassing us. It hasn't been constant , but every few months he starts with something new. Today I stepped outside for a minute. Literally. and he started yelling at me from across the hall. I let it go, but it's starting to bother me. This guy has targeted my family but mainly me over nothing. I don't want to call the police, but I feel if he does do something again I might. I just don't want to cause more problems with these people(his family). In all honesty they all don't seem right in their mind, if I felt more comfortable i'd walk over there and talk it over with them. In fact once I tried talking to him obviously it didn't help. This guy has done all kinds of stuff from yell at us, to even steal from us. He stuck his arm in once through a window and stole a camera. This guy is just mentally not right at all.

Some days he gets really agitated and angry other days hes kinda fine. Idk what his deal is. Flips for no reason  Ive tried taking him to a therapist for diagnostics and im told 
He has ptsd due to sexual abuse and depression. 

Ive tried yelling at him and that didnt work, so then i tried calming down and trying to talk him down from his hissy fits, asking him whats going on and trying to offer him valid solutions to help deal with his problems. He wants to smoke pot and have a good paying job. In my state you cant have both.

Im tired of dealing with him and being his mom. I put his clothes in a seperate laundry basket and ive quit doing his laundry dishes trash etc. I also dont really talk to him anymore because i dont want to set his crappy attitude off. Im always told whatever and go on somewhere. 

I also have add and bipolar 2 that is moderatly controlled through meds. But im still struggling to keep a house clean with 3 guys that dont pick up after themselves. My kids were actually put into kinship fostercare because im struggling so hard. I feel like a legimate failure.

Ive actually just started picking up my own trash doing my own dishes and laundry. I live the rest of it alone. They want to be nasty fine.

I utterly hate myself. I am ashamed of myself, and in the back of my mind I know something is inherently wrong with me and that I should always be ashamed of myself. I should hate myself. I should constantly want to be someone else.

I chronically push people away because I always hate myself/am miserable and depressed. I am left with very few friends, and I chronically avoid relationships because I know... I know I am not good enough. I hate myself why would anyone else ever love me? 

I think this is toxic shame. I think I am suffering from what is now being referred to as toxic shame. I was raised in a very hateful religious environment that fucking condemned my sexuality (straight male). By the time I hit puberty i was praying for forgiveness for being attracted to women. I've been depressed pretty much constantly ever since.

So I'm left alone and lonely suffering from this deep deep pain of self hatred and I can't seem to fix it. I've read book after book, I've done all the exercises. I've spent thousands of dollars and years of my life bouncing from Psychologist to psychologist and I am no closer to finding relief.

It doesn't help that I have this bad bad habit of trying to people please my therapists at any sign that they may be disappointed that for the 6th week in a row NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND I STILL HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT MYSELF.

I am currently trying to get into ""beach body"" shape which makes me feel a bit better, but part of me thinks this is unhealthy. I am pushing myself to such a high standard of physicality because I am nothing, I am worthless, etc. Maybe this will make me something more?

 So Im in yr 12 I have achieved nothing in my whole life so I decided to get more involved in extra curricular's this year (mainly volunteering) and I volunteered for this program called CARA camp so I go with a bunch of other people to the the bottom of Mount Remarkable for 4 days and help out and engage and interact and look after kids with disabilities (mental and physical) who wouldn't be able to go on a 'normal' camp and do activities, however Im very anxious about it and I keep worrying about not being able to sleep, there being spiders (I have panic attacks and have OCDish tendencies and obsessions about spiders, Im not allowed to take bug spray to camp and I sleep with a can of bug spray so i don't know what ill do) Im worried something will happen to one of the kids and its my fault, Im extremely health anxious (i'm never not health anxious) and im worried ill get sick or something will go wrong and ill die or the ambulance wont make it in time (it will take at least 20 min) or something similar, im also worried about the bus trip because its long and i get travel sick and i'm really scared and don't want to go but I fell bad for backing out. Also the next bit may be TMI - i have issues with my bowels and digestive system so I elevate my legs on a stool when I do a bowel movement but I cant take a stool with me so Im worried about that. I also have so much homework and so many assignments to do that i'll probably die and Im worried I wont get them done if I go on camp.

 I wanted to go it seemed like a good idea but now i'm really unsure, if I go im worried and stressed the whole time, but if I dont i feel like im disappointing everyone and that i'll regret not going. I have 2 days to decide, what do I do?",26Jun2017,1

27,"Edit- no idea why this posted as an announcement, I'm sorry.



I'm a person with myriad mental health problems including severe depression, generalised and social anxiety, PTSD, panic attacks, nightmares, insomnia, history of eating disorders and self harm, and suicidal ideation.




I've been through therapy for lots of issues including rape, self harm, depression and have been medicated for depression and anxiety. It's all helped a bit.



But I've been thinking lately (maybe the past year or so) about the underlying problems and my core beliefs and how these influence my mental health. I've had low self esteem/bad self image forever. 


I've never belonged. I've been an outsider for my whole life in one way or another, I moved around a lot as a kid, often the new kid, and moved countries too often to ever feel like I had a nationality or a homebase. Wherever I am people always view me as foreign, even now that I'm living in my birth country I am viewed as foreign because I have never lived here until recently and my accent, mannerisms and word choices reflect all of that. People are always surprised when I say I was born nearby.



The impact of that feeling as well as a lot of bullying is something I have never explored in therapy because it never really occurred to me and the focus was always on CBT and acute trauma rather than ambient 'trauma'.



When I was a kid I was often a target for bullying. I was physically abused (beaten with sticks) as a young child (I have no memories of it but am aware of it happening). From the age of 10 and up I think the bullying was at it's worst. I was called ugly and fat on a daily basis, teased and verbally harassed nearly constantly. Other kids would laugh and band together at my expense. I would go home gleeful if I went through a whole day without being called ugly/fat. I kept a journal for my whole life but I never wrote about the bullying, instead I hyper fixated on any act of kindness I experienced and tried my hardest to present and believe that I belonged. I remember consciously editing my own diary to exclude my own pain and suffering, thinking that when I was older I would have forgotten the pain. Literally the smallest act of kindness would make me feel so happy, and I wrote down minute conversations with others in detail and if someone complimented me I would record that obsessively as well. It was so rare and I just wanted to feel that I belonged and was accepted.




It wasn't one particular kid or group that picked on me, it was everyone in my year and even people from the year above me. The 'popular' kids would at times coordinate attacks. One day when I was 11 or 12 the kids drew a line in the snow in the middle of the field during recess. They called it the 'loser line' and said everyone on my side of it was a loser. They called over everyone who wasn't a 'loser' to stand with them in a group and the kids did. 30 kids stood on the other side of the line and laughed at me. I felt a rage and powerlessness that I've never been able to shake off.



Things got worse as I hit my teens, I was withdrawn and moody (suffering from deep depression, self harm, and an eating disorder as I desperately tried to make myself smaller). A group of boys would wait after school for me (I often left late because I got detentions for not completing homework, and was generally a terrible student etc.). They surrounded me in a circle and threw rocks/snowballs at me, laughing, calling me a witch/freak/fat. That powerlessness and rage filled me again. I had no escape. I tried to attack back, I managed to get to one boy and push him, I wanted to kick him, I wanted to murder him but I was overpowered. I went home that day crying hysterically, the first time I ever let them see me cry.



I was basically a source of cruel amusement for this huge group of people who got their jollies from tormenting me for 4-5 years. Tripping me in the hallways, insulting me, etc. I would sometimes lash out and fostered this deep anger and distrust of all people. My mental health suffered so severely and my avoidance of school activities/lessons was extreme. I had no interest or involvement with school. I would show up, but skip most classes. I didn't try to hide it. I would hand in blank test papers after having stared numbly at the page. My grades were awful (for context I was always at the top of my class and could easily score 90-100 in most things if I tried, but as I got older my anger and distrust of people made me resent the whole system). I presented as a very moody, angry and sullen girl. Teachers were concerned (though some participated in mild bullying/teasing themselves). I was nearly expelled at 14 following an incident and was told that the teachers were afraid of me. I was not aggressive, violent or trouble starting, I was merely detached and had a 'bad attitude'.



When we entered high school the torture sort of faded away and my life slowly improved but the residual impact of that bullying is still very present. Certainly I would describe some of the acute instances as 'traumatic'. They drastically impacted how I lived my life, how my personality developed, and shattered my sense of self and security. I grew up believing I am inherently flawed and rejected from larger society. I feel shaky at all times in social situations and have developed anxieties that seem disproportional to actual risk.




This has been a long story but I am sharing to start a discussion on this and to hear others experiences. And to ask the question- can you develop PTSD or other issues from bullying? I know this is something i should ask a professional but I would like to hear answers from anyone.




Tldr: was bullied constantly from a young age and wondering how this has shaped my self image and mental health problems. Looking for advice on whether bullying can lead to PTSD in some form. (already posted on PTSD subreddit)",26Jun2017,7

32,"About 6 months ago I was dating a really nice guy, and he asked me via text one day in (what I thought was) a very sweet way, about my eyebrows, which he noticed I penciled in. (This is due to a hair pulling compulsion/anxiety that I've been dealing with, also known as trichotillomania). He said that he remembered me saying how awful/traumatizing middle school was and asked if I had been filling in my eyebrows since then. He said that obviously he finds me very attractive but just wanted to understand. He ended by saying that if I didn't want to talk about it I should just forget he said anything. I told him I would tell him about it in person sometime.

Then a few weeks later we were out one night at a bar (more like a lounge - it was quiet), and he asked me if I wanted to talk about it. Knowing that I would probably get emotional and preferred to wait until we were in private I said I would tell him about it sometime. THEN the night he broke up with me we were having a nice dinner and I mentioned about my hospital visit last summer, which was caused by a horrible allergy to some antibiotics. I told him it took my body awhile to feel better and how weird of a reaction it was. He asked me if the reaction had anything to do with my eyebrows - as in, did the reaction cause my eyebrow loss. I told him no and again told him I would tell him sometime (ok, I know I should have just told him but whatever). That night after dinner I asked if he could come up to my apartment so I could talk to him about something, and asked if he wanted to keep seeing me. I just felt like he had been pulling away, and wanted to talk. He ended up shutting down and getting kind of emotional and I found out some pretty intense stuff from his past (emotionally abusive ex who he broke up with a month before me, still having financial connections to her that are hard on him, etc.). I couldn't believe it all just ended.

A week later I texted him a nice Whatsapp message - not long - saying that I was sorry that I didn't open up to him when he asked, and briefly explained, just so it was out in the open. SIXTEEN days later he responded, thanking me for my message, and saying ""not to give him too much credit"" because he was asking mainly for his own mental health because he ""has a problematic paranoia here, which partially derailed his last relationship."" He ended saying he hoped I was well. And that's that. We dated for 4 months.

Can someone please help me understand this?? I am so hurt because I feel like my face basically made him paranoid and drove him away and if that's the case....well that really sucks:-( Was he paranoid that I had mental health issues or something?

33,"A few months back there was a family disaster of sorts (not a death or anything of that kind).

Now it's a few months later and as long as I don't dwell on what happened for too long, I seem to be able to cope, more than that I am happy the majority of the time.

37,"I started having intrusive thoughts about 5 years ago.  They've been there my entire life,  but really surfaced 5 years ago.  

I'm now taking 600 mg (300mg 2x daily) of lithium and I'm noticing that they're resurfacing again and I'm starting to have dreams with harm in them now too, that one isn't common for me.  

My question,  how did your Pure O progress? 

 How bad did it get before it stopped getting bad? 

Mine has advanced from intrusive harm thoughts and obsessing about those, to forcing myself to think the thoughts (to soothe my anxiety), to wondering if I'm actually capable,  to wondering if I'll go so far as doing it,  to what prison will be like,  if I'll ever be sane again,  to feeling only anxiety when I'm with my sig other,  and now to dreaming about crazy things.  

What is there left to do?  I'm on meds,  but what is the next step when no shrinks who specialize in OCD are near or available?

38,"I live in Missouri. My cousin is an extreme bulimic, alcoholic and has severe anxiety. He has wasted away to skin and bones. He spends hours everyday binging water and purging then lying on the floor of his shower. At nights he drinks large amounts of vodka to pass out. He rarely eats and when he does it's usually a bottle of Ensure. He has been having delusions and pukes up blood. He carries a gun around even when drinking and he has talked about wanting to kill people multiple times while drunk. He will not go get help. He will not even go to the hospital. Is there anything legally I can do to force him into help?",26Jun2017,13

45,"Since I like to make people laugh I decided to try an improv comedy class this past weekend. And it was a blast! 
There are some basic ideas of improv that seem to go very well with what most folks deal with in therapy. Everyone fails, there's no such thing as failure, don't think too much, etc.

Doing some research later that night i found that drama therapy is actually a thing! I'm totally going to mention this to some people I know who deal with depression, anxiety, etc. ",26Jun2017,1

48,"[This was my original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/6i9llu/i_went_to_therapy_for_the_first_time_and_i_hated/)

So I ended up sending an email to the office and explaining what had happened to me, and the coordinator profusely apologized to me and told me that's not how therapy is supposed to go. They hooked me up with a different therapist to see right away, so I saw her on Friday and OH MAN was it completely different. It was so structured and organized and I finally felt in control of the situation. I read her the list of things I wanted to focus on in therapy sessions in the next few weeks which I didn't get the chance to do last time. She ended up being really nice and I feel like she's gonna be a really good fit for me.

I just wanna thank everyone for the advice in my original post and kind words because I felt really hopeless in that moment and wasn't sure what to do! I've had such bad experiences with all kinds of mental health workers, nurses, psychiatrists, etc. If anyone is ever having the same kind of problem where they feel they aren't getting the right kind of help, just be honest and tell somebody!!! That's the best thing you can do. Stand up for yourself and demand help, it's your right to have it and you deserve it. Thanks guys &lt;3",26Jun2017,55
49,"Hi redditors,

I couldn't take being in my own head anymore this morning on the way to work.

My body, mind and emotions felt so keyed up and taut; as if one more drop of tension, one more stressful moment might set off an internal implosion and a public breakdown of tears and panic.

I turned around in the opposite direction from work and went to the walk-in clinic. 
The doctor I saw spoke to me for a while, and suggested I increase and change my meds. :(  I also now have a 2-3 week sick leave.

My problem: I have sufferred from anxiety and depression since I was a young teenager. Since then, and since I started taking meds to deal with my terrifying and crippling emotions, I have had a hard time accepting my need to take these pills.

On one hand I need them to function; on the other, the meds are such a shameful secret of mine. I am terrified of divulging this secret to potential dating partners, potential close friends for fear they will negatively judge me.

Hell, I negatively judge myself. I feel deficient in some primal way, broken, defective, handicapped.
Fuck, I'm 35. I need to accept this as part of me. But I'm so scared I'm not loveable at my core because of it.

Please -- I need to hear your voices, people out there who have felt similarly, people who are working through the same thing, people who have come out the other side.

How does one accept this about oneself?

NB.  Please, no snarky comments. They are completely useless in situations like this. And yes, I see a therapist already.
What I'm looking for is connection and to share personal insights.

50,"I've been in therapy for about 8 years now, and am in the best health I have ever been. However, I still struggle with some aspects of self-care. I mainly struggle with finding the motivation to do the things I know I need to do for myself. If my friends need anything, I'd drop everything I was doing to help, however I can't say that I share the same urgency for my own wellbeing.

Today, in my therapy session, I mentioned how self-care can be stressful and exhausting. When asked to explain why, I wasn't able to find words to describe why. The best I can think of is ""it just is"", which isn't a sufficient answer.

Can anyone help me find the words to explain why caring for myself can be difficult? Thanks in advance!",26Jun2017,11
51,"Hi, I'm hoping to illicit some advice from some of you.

I've been dealing with depersonalization/derealization for over a decade now, and while I'm able to deal with it most of the time, it comes with a really aggravating side effect: constant mental blocks.

I'm generally unable to read, perform in any of my hobbies, or even find joy in most things, because of an odd and very strong mental block. It's sort of like my mind (or subconscious) is deliberately pulling my attention away and causing a noxious response to doing these things.

To be honest, I've been bored for years now and have no way to do anything about it because something won't let me. I used to and still do love to learn, but it's like my attention span is absolutely unwilling to yield.

I'm in my mid twenties, so I've lost a lot of my youth to dealing with this garbage.

I've had an MRI and there's nothing negative to speak of in the results, I'm on no medication, and I really am at a loss.

Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? If so, what helped?

Thanks.",26Jun2017,2

53,I only write about self deprecating stuff. I tried to stop recently. Think i lasted 2 days. The problem is im low on confidence and i get kinda depressed about it. I just get some relief for a short time. I self depracate loads to my family and will do it online on Reddit even more. It's the only thing i can talk about with a kind of enthusiasm. I dont know what else to talk about on Reddit.or what subreddits i could even get involved in. It's pretty sad. Is it common for someone to come on here primarily to shine? And not have much to contribute to any other topics?,26Jun2017,1

55,"So I've started taking sertraline (known as zoloft in the US) for a month, and I feel more depressed and my thoughts are very odd. Yesterday was a REALLY bad day. I was depressed and catatonic for an hour or two, I sort of snap out of it and all of a sudden I thought ""I'm dead and for some reason I can't decompose properly, that's why my life is like this"" to me it makes sense and I kind of believe it, but I know it's odd, but it felt like when you try to figure out a problem and feel so relieved when you get the correct answer. 

When I was trying to go to sleep I heard a whisper say ""They're going to kill you"", this of course freaked me out. A few minutes (fully awake and freaked out) later I heard someone laughing in my room.

Also there was an odd smell (I live in student flats) that smelt awful. Apparently it was fish from someones flat and had to get the cleaners in, but fish doesn't smell like that. I read that a dead body smells rotten and sweet, that's what it smelt like to me, so I kept thinking ""they're just not telling us about a dead body"".

I don't know what's going on. I know I have anxiety and depression, but I usually don't hear things or have strange thoughts (they can't be delusions because I know they're ridiculous ). I remember hearing things and thinking strange stuff as a kid (not being able to sleep because I thought people were filming me and watching it on TV), but just thought kids have an overactive imagination. Has sertraline done this for anyone else?",26Jun2017,2
56,"I have worked with a few psychiatrists in the past and have received a few different diagnosis but none of them have ever seemed to really hit the nail on the head, leading to less than effective treatment. 

I work in the technology industry so seeing science play some role in diagnosis rather than just answering some questions and trying to compare it to the DSM would be great. 

What are some new diagnostic tools that I should be asking for? A brain scan?

I want to get a very accurate diagnosis but have lost a lot of faith in the guesswork around what I have seen thus far. ",26Jun2017,1
57,"Yes.

We always argue, almost everything. They always tell me how i should be. Even about my appereance.

Yes, we always argue about beard and hair. I love growing beard but they always say that i should cut them off. Because its's not good for 'society' bla bla they say. (Sometimes i dont want to grow but i do in purpose. I am kinda stubborn.)

Fuck society, fuck everything. I  want to live how i want.

They even tell me what my job should be. They don't even fuckin care what i want. When i argue, they don't understand. 

I am really done. 

I graduated and have been living with them for 5 months.

I will leave them to work next month, will stay another city and looking forward to it.

I dont want to live and talk to them anymore. I really feel nothing towards them(or i want to?)

They dont support me about my job.
I always feed anixety for not to gain money or when i have some troubles in my job, i know they won't support me. They will say, you should't have do it. We've said you bla bla.

I know, they always want my happines like all families but they should understand and listen their children. I want my happines more than anyone.

Plus, i don't want to act like how they want me for their happies. They will accept me or i move away from them over time.

59,"So I know that it is normal to feel sadness when someone passes away. But basically i like to read, and I found these short stories online that I loved. I didn't know anything about the author at all I just liked her stories. I guess the author had her friend help her with some of the stories so hey shared an account. At the end of one of the stories her friend wrote Melissa (the main author) has passed away in a car accident and wrote this long thing about her, and she was also only 16. Now I wasn't so much sad because there wouldn't be anymore stories from her, but more so because she was so young. But the thing is I didn't know anything about her, I don't even know what she looks like, and I've only been reading her stories for a day, but I feel so sad about it, and I l started to cry as if I was super close with her. But I also have realized I get this way when hearing about something happening to someone on social media. I'm naturally an emotional person, but is this normal. And also the author passed away a few years ago so Im just confused why Im this sad about someone I don't know anything about, or don't even know what they look like ",26Jun2017,1
60,"Please no one judge me for this post. I am 19 years old I have my permit but not my license. I can get my license in the end of July. I barely passed my permit, I got lucky for the most part. I have started practicing driving with my dad but feel I am making no progress.
   I have a lot of anxiety in life in general I panic a lot and get stressed a lot..this means when driving I am so stressed and terrified. Driving to me there is so much to look at, so much to watch for that it's impossible to watch it all at once. I'm either watching one thing or the other I'm watching both things but then realize I'm going too fast or too slow.
   I keep trying to practice but my dad freaks out on me which makes me also freak out. He thinking driving is common sense when it's not like he's like oh I shouldn't have to tell you that and he keeps freaking out then yelling at me to not do that as if I know..like one thing I'll be far into their lane and he says I'm jerking the car too much to turn outta their lane and he says I'll flip the car over...him freaking out and yelling makes me freak out
   I also have other drivers honking at me cussing me out flicking me off and it's like I'm learning how else can I learn besides practice and experience?
   I HAVE to have my license by the end of July because college is already payed for for me to go to college in august and I'd have to drive myself
   Does it ever get better? I'm trying to practice and I feel like I'm not getting any better and I really am lost and don't know how to learn.",26Jun2017,1
