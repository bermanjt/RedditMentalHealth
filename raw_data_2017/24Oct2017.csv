0,"So i saw a psychologist for the first time today to discuss my symptoms of OCD and bipolar, plus intense derealization and delusions... and he was very patronizing and made way too many simplifications 

This has been two straight years now of sitting alone in my room, in the dark, obsessing over ""aligning"" my internal world correctly and finding symmetry in my thoughts, two years of feeling like I'm in a hazy dream, dealing with intense delusions - e.g. I think my cat is going to send me a message, a man is going to show up and give me 1 billion dollars spontaneously, googling random people I think are ""angels"" and contacting them asking for advice to get to heaven, etc 

It's also been 2 years of arbitrary mood shifts, feeling like I'm on morphine one minute, feeling ready to put a bullet in my brain the next. My daily life is a cycle of sitting in a dark room for hours, fantasizing endlessly, obsessing over ""symmetry"", extreme mood swings, feeling like I'm in a dream, oftentimes feeling ready to kill myself or someone else at a moment's notice (although I didn't tell him this)

I described all of my mental health symptoms to him and he totally downplayed it all, said I wasn't psychotic because I ""knew the delusions weren't real"", and said I probably just had a mild mood disorder with no OCD or anythijng serious, I'm just ""a little down!"", is this a fucking joke?

And as far as simplifications go, he said my delusions of cats speaking to me/strangers being ""angels"" were just me ""feeling sad and hoping for good things"", I mean what the fuck man? I literally think my cat is an angel sending me messages from God and that's the response I get?

I spend two years in a room obsessing over mental alignment and symmetry, feeling like I'm in a dream (thinking I'm the only conscious person alive), imagining people on TV have secrets to tell me, and this is the response I get when I speak up about it?

""Oh, you just seem like you have a mild mood disorder, you're just hoping for good things to happen, no big deal"" 

I mean what the fuck? My actual doctor was far more concerned than this guy so I'm a bit uncertain what to do here, I think he's simplifying my problems way too much and I'm kinda pissed off. Should I see someone else or am I going overboard here?",24Oct2017,0
1,"So...I just started a new job. I'm really excited because I have wanted this particular job for years. 
The only downside is that you basically leave when the job is done as opposed to at a set time. Therefore, I sometimes spend 9-10 hours at work. Because the times vary, it's difficult to schedule doctor's appointments. 

I've been seeing a therapist for years and I feel it's necessary for my sanity... but I know some coworkers wonder why I say I need to leave at a certain time one day every week. 

I don't want anyone to think I'm lying and just trying to get out of work, but I'm also too embarrassed to blurt out to gossipy strangers that I see a therapist. 

Any advice? ",24Oct2017,2
2,"i had an awesome therapist a couple years ago. she was actually a grad student but she changed my life. after she graduated they assigned me to another grad student (this was through uni). i had a major relapse when i was with the new one. i don't blame her, but i would dread our sessions and always came away feeling just as bad or worse. i finally stopped seeing her at the end of my senior year and i'm doing better now. i still miss the old one. i think there are laws or some kind of rules that say i'm not allowed to contact her, but i wish i could just say hello or let her know where i'm at now, which is a good place. and i still wonder if i'd be doing even better if she could have still been my therapist instead of getting assigned a new one. can anyone relate?",24Oct2017,4
3,"Stress, anxiety, and depression are things that I’ve struggled with for most of my life, from adolescence on. I have gone through countless days, in a state of tension, worry, stress, over-thinking, and self-loathing. The mechanisms, as I’ve come to learn, are quite simple. I have some deep, underlying fear; the fear of our trust in others will be broken, for example. This fear represents potential pain. The pain of being abandoned by a loved one, for example. In an effort to avoid ever feeling such an emotion, such a painful feeling, I fear it is going to overwhelm me and be too much for me to bear. It is this fear, not of the pain of the emotion itself, but of myself, the fear that I won’t be able to tolerate the overwhelming wave of feeling and emotion. 

So, what do I do to prevent myself from being open to experience this pain? I try to shut it out. I try my hardest to distract myself, to try and think of other things, to delude myself to believe something that will prevent me from coming face to face with what I fear most of all. My body tenses up because I am afraid to feel. This leads us away from what truly is, and we truly are, we shut ourselves out of ourselves, because we’re scared of experiencing ourselves.  So, what happens when we start to feel a swell of painful emotion when it is brought to our attention? We stifle it, smother it, do everything possible to not feel it. What happens next, is we panic, because our bodies and minds are so frightful as to what will happen if we just let our emotions be. We try to get a tight grip on how we feel, on what we’re thinking, anything to prevent the pain of experiencing an emotion. This is what causes the body to tense and for us to be stressed. 

Our survival instincts are activated and when we are in a deep panic, we start to use our minds much more conscientiously to try and figure a way out of our current predicament, to try to reason with ourselves to relax and calm down and find that place of joy and relaxation that we have all felt from time to time and eternally long for. However, using the mind to accomplish this is foolhardy, because the problem is not of mind but of body, of emotion and of our nervous system. (With the exception that you could possibly realize the way to happiness by thinking about the principles, and then applying them.) What happens next, is that you’re so tired from expending so much energy maintaining this rigidity in order to suppress your feelings that you are so afraid of experiencing. This becomes wearisome. Some are able to last longer than others, but this coping mechanism is unsustainable and will inevitably lead to breaking those who attempt to implement it, or at the least, leave them a life of stress and dissatisfaction. What happens next is that you become depressed, you get so upset with yourself that you are so weak as to unable to overcome a simple painful thought or feeling, how non-resilient you are because a simple wave of worry leaves you in a state of panic and stress, how you’re unable to get out of it through sheer will alone. You feel week, powerless, hopeless.  Worse yet, you’ve got a lifetime of social interactions to deal with and you’re still there, swimming around in your head searching for answers, in a state of panic, feeling like you have no agency and you’re useless, how fun! However, there is a simple way to overcome this dark, hopeless feeling. 

It is by seeking out the things that are making you feel pain. Whether it is the fear of being abandoned by our loved ones, the fear of having our trust broken by the ones we love most dearly. I believe that these are the only true fears, other than the ultimate fear, which is of our ability to experience these emotions and survive. Once you let go, once you steer into the discomfort, you let all of your emotions burn in your belly freely like there is a cauldron full of burning embers, with each moment of pain and fear being fed into it as we grow and experience, growing stronger with each passing feeling that gets fed into it as our resiliency grows and our fear subsides. After enough training, what is there left to be afraid of? The fire that we feel is our growth, by virtue of our ability to immerse ourselves in the wave of emotions and remain calm. In this way, we are slowly getting rid of something in the body and becoming more free as a result, we are losing our fear. This helps us remain calm and loving as it is fear, and the fear of fear, which is the primordial catalyst for harmful actions and uncompassionate thoughts. It is simply by not placing a lid on this cauldron, by allowing it to burn free and embrace the heat that is produced, that you will feel more free, more alive, more loving than you ever thought possible. You truly start to get in touch with your self, the energy that runs through all of us, that guides us into making the best decisions and a feeling of calm and peace that feels better than any emotion you have ever experienced, you are experiencing all of them.  This is what is meant by ‘being aware’ and ‘in the moment’. It is this constant feeling and the ease and satisfaction sensation one gets from releasing their emotions. This is possible within all of us, even the most neurotic, depressed, anxious, stressed amongst us, by yielding to the power of your self and your emotions, knowing you are strong enough to overcome whatever fire that is currently burning within you, by keeping the lid off the cauldron, so to speak, this is the secret to overcoming depression and to truly experience yourself and all of the wonderful possibilities of life.

5,"For the last seven years since my mom and dad got divorced (and likely prior to that), my mom's mental health has spiraled out of control. She has never been able to maintain friendships and has always been hypersensitive to criticism, but for the last seven years or so, she has become obsessed with how much time I spend with my dad instead of her when I visit my hometown (I live in another city). After many arguments and letters written where I explain what's wrong and she promises to change, she continues to obsess over this, and spends the vast majority of our time together complaining about how I spend more time with my dad, even when I split it evenly.

I've tried to communicate that this needs to change in order for us to have a relationship, and she refuses to admit she's done anything wrong, and I believe she legitimately sees nothing wrong with how she acts. She wrote me a letter recently where she said ""she wasn't sure who I had been talking to"" about getting these negative ideas in her head, implying that my dad (who's a very normal, non-malicious person) and I were out to get her. 

Since she won't get it herself, how do I begin to broach the subject of her getting treatment? She goes to a therapist (that I convinced her to see after years of arguing) but I don't believe she tells her the truth. She badly needs help but won't seek it out on her own and won't allow anyone to tell her she needs it. I was previously the last person on earth she trusted, and now I may have gone over to the ""dark side"" in her mind. 

Any suggestions for how I get her a diagnosis and treatment? Thanks reddit.",24Oct2017,1

7,"I was in an abusive relationship for one and a half years. I was regularly beaten and sexually abused by someone I thought I could fix, and was too afraid to leave. I have been out of this situation for about five months now, and I feel like I have completely disassociated myself from my experiences.


Sometimes I write about the things that happened to me, and sometimes I practice what I would tell someone if I ever felt comfortable enough to talk about it with another person. (I haven't told anyone about my experiences, even those closest to me. No one knows what happened to me while I was with that man.) When I am confronted with my own experiences and my own memories it feels like I am recounting a story that someone told me or something I watched on TV. It does not feel like these my my own personal experiences, it feels like it didn't happen to me at all


When I am exposed to things that should trigger me (for example, a scene in a movie I watched recently where a wife and her daughter are beaten by the father of the household) I don't feel any sadness or pain. Is this normal? The last time I was beaten was in May, so why have I already moved so far past it I can't connect emotionally to what happened to me anymore?


I can barely remember the past year and a half and it terrifies me. It was the end of my junior year of college and my entire senior year. My whole last year of college is a blur, I barely remember anything that happened to me, even the good times. The same goes for the end of my junior year and the summer in between. I can barely remember anything from those times, but I have vivid memories of my life before and after the relationship.


There have been instances where I have been triggered and I go into a manic state, where I cry a lot and I feel physical pain and it's hard to move and I can close my eyes and see horrible things happening to me. I feel like a scared child, I don't feel like me I feel like someone completely different. When I am in this state I can remember the last one and half years in a way I just can't when I'm not in this state. When the episode ends, its like waking up from a dream. Suddenly I can't remember my experiences anymore.


I know this is a lot, I don't want anyone reading this to feel sorry for me or pity me, because it will only make me pity myself and that is the last thing I need. (I don't even know if this is the right subreddit for this) I just need to know if this stuff is normal for someone who experienced what I did and I need help dealing with it. Thank you.",24Oct2017,2

9,"I (M20) just heard her talking to my sister (F30) on the phone, and she said ""Well keep doing it until he breaks down."" Earlier my sister had been complaining to my mom about her (my sister's) husband and how she's sick and doesn't want to do the chores. So my mom wants her to keep harassing him to help more until he ""breaks down"" even though he works for 60-70 hours a week. They both usually regularly shit talk her husband when they're together and I hear it in the kitchen. It's completely unnecessary and toxic. He doesn't take out the garbage and she talks like he's a satan born, war criminal and he's an asshole that doesn't do anything except go to work, even though he's the sole provider of all their income, which is also above average and they're financially stable (I know this because I used to work with him). How selfish of him! She says. My sister more and more speaks out about him like this at family gatherings also, and it's embarrassing for everyone.  He kind of laughs it off but I'm seeing how it's effecting him.  He used to be way more at ease and happy going. If it was me I would honestly just divorce my sister because of her entitlement and toxic fuel from my mother.  She has 2 kids with him now, one was unplanned and she begged him for a second child but now she bitches that he isn't involved enough with them.

My mom has this super passive aggressive attitude all the time when she doesn't get her way. Just now my dad didn't agree with her she just says snarkily ""That's great."" And storms off into her room. Once in a while she specifically gets my dad going and pushes him until he snaps then he get's pissed and yells and then she turns into a victim.

In the past I have been smacked in the mouth with braces on so my mouth would be full of blood, choked, punched, and paddled as a small child (3 years old) All by her. I also remember getting smacked in the face for crying numerous times.

About 5 years back my sister was fairly unstable mentally and she would call my mom pretty regularly at night and cry. My mom would usually in about 5 minutes yell her that nothing is wrong and scream at her saying that she's being selfish and to go to bed.

She has a master's degree and talks about it all the time and that she's overqualified for her job. But she never actually used it.

She will always says that she doesn't like attention but when she's out she'll yell and hoot and holler at friends or say something controversial and make a scene to be the centre of attention.

She used to be a part of 2 or 3 committees while also working and she'd just complain every day about how much she hates them even though they were 100% voluntarily.

She tells me I'm wrong all the time and mimics me in demeaning ways whenever I challenge something that she says. She called me retarded today because she didn't understand what I was saying and just kept mocking me by repeating me and interrupting.

She always has to have the last word and never admits she's wrong, ever. I remember her apologizing to me exactly twice in my entire life. Usually when she says sorry it's a ""WELL SOOOREEY FOR TRYING TO HELP"" when she fucks something up and people get mad.

Fun fact, when I was 12 I found out I was an unplanned pregnancy. So maybe it's all my fault for ruining my parent's perfect two child life I guess?

So what do you think? I'm thinking something to do with psychopathy/histrionic/narcissist/ possible borderline?

She has also taken a liking to kicking my door whenever she passes it to cause me anxiety because I think she's going to bust in and scream at me.  I spend most of the time when she's home alone isolated in my room.

Cherry on top she would say nothing when my brother called me a ""Useless piece of shit"",  on occasion.",24Oct2017,1

**Beware of triggers: Suicide, Substance Abuse, descriptions of mental health facilities**

*Story:*

I was suicidal, down, beaten by my own brain. I couldn’t touch a phone or leave my apartment due to shame and fear. No where to turn. I couldn’t get an appointment with a therapist that would take my insurance, and I couldn’t get seen by a psychiatrist without waiting over 6 weeks. I needed help badly and couldn’t figure out what way to turn. 

While I was planning to end my life, I decided to give myself one more chance to get help.  But, where do I go?

Hospitals do have mental health care for emergency situations, however, it’s geared towards people who have actively attempted suicide already and for those who are dying due to substance abuse or are a danger to themselves/others because of the severity of their mental illness. This is normally something like a person who stops taking their medicine for their schizophrenia, or people with untreated personality disorders, or those going through a dangerous substance abuse problem. 

In my experience, emergency rooms and hospitals just haven't been equipped to take care of people who are plagued with thoughts of suicide day in and day out, or those who are “functioning” substance abusers. 

These people are just as deserving of medical care, but if you can’t find a medical provider and you’d get turned away from the hospital…*where do you go?*

I did a last-ditch effort search on my computer for treatment facilities. I was about ready to throw away ten grand (yeah $10,000 or more) for one of those addiction treatment centers that celebrities go to, the ones advertised on television…even though substance abuse wasn’t an issue for me, I *just* wanted to die. 

**However, I was in luck when it came to treatment.** 

Colorado has revamped their emergency mental health and the results are pretty damn impressive.

I ended up walking a few miles to one of the 11 mental health Walk-In Crisis Service clinics, run by the Colorado Crisis Service. I was immediately greeted by friendly faces and people who were highly trained to help me find resources and medical care. I was seen by a nurse and then a therapist who decided that I should go to a 5 day program for mental health at a mental health facility that is associated with this program (PM me if you want the name of the specific place). 

**This program saved my life.**

I can't speak highly enough of this facility/program. This place saves lives by showing the patient how to live a healthier life, pulling them from a deep dark place or rock bottom. Everyone at the facility will go out of their way to make people safe, secure, and the therapists and counselors provide out of this world care to the patients.

The people who worked there care deeply and are highly trained in a wide range of mental health illnesses/issues, and if no one there has enough experience to help they do EVERYTHING in their power to find somewhere/someone for you to talk to. Seriously, I had a case manager spend hours calling and doing research just to help me get my medicine below a $50 co-pay.


The facility provided mental health stabilization (as well as providing a kick ass addiction treatment therapy/stabilization) where you can get 24/7 care (for up to 5 days at this time) by a ""perscriptionist"" (psychiatrist) and the therapists. It's like a mental retreat, nothing like a psych ward in the hospital and NOTHING like the stereotype of a mental health facility with straight-jackets and people wandering around muttering to themselves (though we did have a few folks that did that, but they were all super cool people so don't be too quick to judge).

Patients are given a structured schedule while “living” in a dormitory style building. Patients were fed, clothed (if necessary), given a bed to sleep in and a place to wash themselves. There are four separate hour-long group therapy sessions run by the unbelievably professional and talented therapists (as well as therapists in training, what great hands on experience!). The group therapy helps the patients get to know one another, bond with their struggles and find common ground among people from all walks of life, and most importantly they learn healthy coping mechanisms and are SHOWN how to apply them in a nearly classroom type setting. Each patient also gets seen by a therapist individually or at least one session per day, where you can really dive into the nitty gritty problems the patient faces and make breakthroughs about their thought process, lives, and emotional instabilities. 

One of the best parts of the program is you are totally kept away from social media. There is one computer that all the patients are free to use (for things aside from social media, those websites are blocked) and there are landline phones that connect to the outside world (that’s right, NO cellphones or Facebook for five whole days). 

The patients who go to this program are given a unique opportunity to really get to know themselves and understand their problems, while also learning how to face them in a healthy way. This may sound simple, but it is far from it. It’s a lot of work, but everyone who works here makes it all possible. The sky is the limit when you go through this program, but you can’t get it unless you put in the work…but you are never alone through any step of that process. 

Now, I’ve completed the program and I’m no longer feeling suicidal. I’m excited for the next stage of my life. 

Going through this program gave me the strength to come out as transgender to my family, which I was terrified to do. So terrified I wanted to die, but now I have the support I never ever thought I would have along with all the healthy life skills I learned at the Crisis Service and mental health facility. And if I ever feel unsafe with my own head or fall into something unhealthy, I know I can also call (or text, or chat online) the Colorado Crisis Service at 1-844-493-8255…or just go to any of the walk in centers listed on the [website](http://coloradocrisisservices.org/). 

How wonderful, to know you have the option to get help in the state of Colorado!

Anyway, that’s it. Thanks for reading and have a super great day!

13,"I'm so tired of feeling like shit. The only calm moment in my life is when I sleep. I wake up and then anexity hits me. I wake up and worry I'm not good enough. I lay in bed thinking about why I shouldn't  go to class because everyone hates me.

At this point the only reason I go to campus is for medical assistance but I'm another student in thier eyes.

I speak to my parents at least once a month so they know I'm somewhat alive, but I feel dead. I feel like I'm already gone. 

I just sit in my room,  laying on my bed unable to move for hours on end. I tell my roommates and family I'm depressed but yet I'm viewed as being dramatic.

On top of my server depression and anexity, in the beginning 2017 I was diagnosed with having myocarditis which resulted in two painful experiences with my heart. Couple months later I picked up Giardia from somewhere resulting in a 25 pound weight loss. I'm 24 and now weighing at 119 pounds.

I'm tired of feeling sick all the time. I'm sad I have no friends and I'm sad no family has seen me or shown any concern. I'm the oldest of two sisters and always been the black sheep of my family. My youngest sister at 20 is pregnant with her second child and my middle sister at the age of 23 is preparing for her wedding. I just want a little attention

I'm currently taking 20mg of Lexapro now and I don't know if it's helping. Sometimes I close my eyes and wish I'm somewhere else or another heart attack will take me. I cant even look at myself sometimes because of all the weight I lost. At least I'm finally getting treatment but I'm so tired.

I was recommended to take a medical withdrawal.

I'm tired of feeling like shit all the time. I'm tired of everything being a stuggle. I don't understand why everything around me all of a sudden turned to shit.

I expected making life long friends and great experiences during college but that's wasn't the case. I'm tired of being alone. 
At this point when I go to class, as I view everyone I feel a strong hatred towards everyone. It's not thier fault, it's me.

It bothers me how happy everyone is, how I hear conversations about thier plans for the tailgate or the next university event. How everyone is having a great college experience and I'm just suffering.

I know at this point I do have personal issues but I'm tired of feeling left out, sick and at this point wasting my twentys.

I joined an Overwatch team on campus and was completely ignored  me because of team popularity  ( plus they sucked)

I'm tired of everything. My health is shit, I try to make friends and feel left out  and at this point I moved on on online friendships because I'm so desperate for somewhat of a companionship.

I'm tired of being angry all the time.
I'm tired of being sleepy all the time.
I'm tired of not being happy.

Weekly I see a doctor for my heart and a therapist and a psychologist. Im just so drained.

Does anyone have any advice?",24Oct2017,1
14,"I used to be reasonably happy during early childhood in Croatia, but lost that after moving to Canada, probably due to a bad home situation plus bullying and lack of friends. For a long time I had forgotten what I lost.

Seems like one time I had a taste, when I got a lamp in my room which was similar to a lamp I had in Croatia. I cried for a while for a mostly inexplicable reason linked with some feeling associated with the lamp.

I first got a significant taste of the good state via a drug. The way I felt good reminded me of the way I felt during childhood. I had much more inner peace and a much more profound enjoyment of my surroundings.

Actual progress was being able to reach such states sober. At first I was confused. Why did Canada feel like Croatia? Later I understood the ""Canada feeling"" was the way life felt when I am anxious and depressed or something like that, and the ""Croatia feeling"" was the way life felt when relatively relaxed and happy.

Whenever I reached a level of happiness which was still very rare in my life in Canada, my surroundings would still feel like Croatia and remind me of experiences in Croatia. Seeing the very much better way of experiencing something in Canada could make me upset. I would be upset that I had lost that good way of experiencing reality, and upset at how much I experienced in a much, much worse way. So, a brief internal burst of anger and even hatred toward Canada or even the entire world could result, and throw me out of the good state. When I was able to experience the state more times, this would disappear, leaving me able to just be that way and appreciate it.

Other times, reminded of how something felt very good in the past, and thinking I couldn't find anything that good anymore, I would be upset in a different way, feeling intense pain and wanting suicide. Like the previous kind, these moments were very brief but intense, and not motivating me into any bad action. But, nevertheless their mere painful intensity is troubling.

It's weird how I never had negative flashbacks about all the terrible traumatic shit I experienced at home, and I have these good flashbacks I never read about.

I do have one kind of bad flashback type experience though, remembering social actions which seemed excessively awkward or otherwise wrong and feeling various painful feelings about those. These aren't as intense and deep as the positive flashbacks I mentioned.",24Oct2017,1
15,"My motivation will just drop through the floor into the negative, random times at work. I mean literally the negative, pushing against it pushes back like with anxiety barriers. Simple stuff I could do just fine, if I wasn't suddenly struck with an urge to just walk out of work and quit rather than put one more second in. It's not just  ""Don't want to"" but just suddenly would rather walk through hell itself and back again than continue whatever simple tasks I am perfectly capable of doing very easily.

It's not work, work is pretty chill. It's definitely me. I've always had issues with maintaining focus and motivation.

Generally speaking, I can't focus or be motivated for shit during the morning/earlyafternoon. After about 6-9 hours of being awake, I'll switch over to manic focus and motivation for no fucking reason at all. Without fail. It's not getting home or leaving work or any change of environment either. If I'm at work from 9 AM to 9 PM or later my most productive hours at work are ~5 PM until I literally pass out. Caffeine and other stimulants, full nights sleep, anxiety and SSRI meds, etc, I've tried switching things up but this just seems to be me. My coworkers joke about me being a cave troll, I've got the lights down low if it's just me and there's no one to complain. I'd almost think it's a distraction-issue, I work better in isolation when everybody and environmental stimuli fuck off. I could just start sleeping right when I get home, so I'm working in the second half of my waking-hours, but it would really fuck with my scheduling and interfacing at all in a 9-5 world. College I had the same issue, can't focus or work for shit but was a champion of late-night work benders cranking out more than regular students would in the same length of time earlier in the day.

16,"I've suffered from depression for a long time, and I have an opportunity to start counseling via the Employee Assistance Program at work. My issues have affected my job performance, but my supervisors are being very supportive. They want me to succeed, and they want me to get help. I'm trying now, which I haven't done in a long, long time.

I know at this point that I need help, because a few weeks ago I had thoughts that legitimately did frighten me. Not suicidal thoughts, or thoughts about how I should be dead, I'm used to those. This was a new low, a new level of self-loathing that I hadn't really encountered before.

So I made an appointment with a counselor, this isn't therapy, it's a precursor to that, but it's a start. I'm terrified. I'm so scared about going to that appointment tomorrow, but I have to do it.

25,"Hey everyone,

I've been in therapy on-off for about three years now and have made a lot of progress with CBT, especially by challenging my 'core beliefs'. 
At the moment I'm struggling with my self-esteem. I find that if people don't find me the most attractive person ever in the universe, then I must have no worth. Obviously, it's a unachievable goal so I often feel worthless. 
I'm looking to challenge this belief and shift the focus of my worth away from my looks, but I'm unsure what a 'healthy' self-worth would focus on.

Should I base it on success, amount of friends, overall happiness in life, etc.? I don't really think these things make up a person's worth, but I'm not really in position atm to say what does!

Has anyone dealt with similar issues?
Any help is appreciated, thank you so much!",24Oct2017,3

29,"I couldn’t resist asking about this. I’ve tried Google, and if this exists elsewhere, I don’t know the terminology to find it. Anyway, I intentionally blame seemingly unrelated things for bad circumstances. Sometimes I do mental gymnastics to connect the unrelated issues, but often I just accept it as the way things are.

Examples:

I wanted to run last weekend, but it was raining. I blamed the rain on the fact that I didn’t play football in high school.

The chef completely screwed up my dinner last night, and I’m pretty sure it’s because my neighbor is an alcoholic.

Just to clarify, there’s usually no divine intervention in my blame game. The rain isn’t God’s punishment for me not playing football, but the lack of football in my life set certain unintended scientific consequences into play, which many years later, caused rain in my geographic area at the time I wanted to go for a run.

In the “cook and alcoholic neighbor” example, the chef is my friend’s personal chef, 300 miles from where I live. The chef has no idea who my neighbor is, but my friend met him briefly once, for about 15 minutes.",24Oct2017,1

31,"(*A* cause, not *the* cause.)

I can realistically attribute abilities and personality traits to myself. But I don't have a feeling of who I am, and mostly I'm neither content or discontent with myself. It's like I don't relate to myself emotionally. 

I am confident in myself with regard to many things. I have accomplished things I have reason to be proud of. But I don't feel any pride. I don't secretly think less of these accomplishments. I just don't feel what I think.

I strongly believe in human dignity and I feel empathy for others. But I don't have a *feeling* of my own worth or lack thereof. I don't see what would be a valid basis for such a feeling.

I have experienced things while literally thinking 'This is fun,' or 'I'm enjoying myself right now.' I remember thinking that, but I can't recall the emotion, not even traces of it.

I know I'm important to others, I know they care deeply about me. I enjoy their company (except when I'm depressed and everything is exhausting). But reminding myself about how people care about me doesn't seem to have any emotional effect.

When I'm depressed, the loving attention I get from others feels unpleasant and exhausting. (I don't tell myself I don't deserve it or anything.) When I feel well and someone is nice to me, it is both pleasant and somehow makes me uncomfortable. I like to help people, also because I causes them to think well (or certainly not ill) of me. But the (completely normal) gratitude they express is unpleasant to me.

Dealing with low self-esteem is one thing. But it seems to me that this is something different.

44,"Hi! 
First of all, sorry my bad English, it's not my native language and I'll try my best to make myself clear. 
I write this because I've been struggling with something that might sound a bit stupid but wich I feel is more and more breaking me and I never found, in the writing of others, the precise description of my problem 
I'll try to be short.

For approximately 4 years now, I changed drastically my way of approaching life. I got dumped by my girlfriend after a pretty strong and intense relation because I was simply selfish and didn't care enough about us. I knew she might not be the love of my life but the break up hurt so bad because I knew it was all my fault. After few months of mourning, I decided to get my shit together and to change completely my way of approaching life. I decides that, for now, I'll just try to give my best at everything I do, never not to care anymore. I tried to force myself to become some kind of perfectionist. I never wanted to regret anything anymore. Of course, as stupid as this may sound, I knew that the goal was unrealistic but also agreed with myself to focus, as much as possible, only on the process, not the result. I didn't expect crazy change in my life or immediate result but just a global feeling of self satisfaction that, whatever I try (really anything. Work, relationship, hobbys but even every small thing I do, every move and thought) with maximum effort and discipline, I knew afterward that I did my best. 

Even I was failing to fulfil this commitment all the time and was ""breaking down"" every 2 to 6 hours from this ""mantra"", I managed to overall have some insanely good result. A lot of aspect of my life slowly got more successful over the year, particulary my work (I was just starting my career as the time I started this process). My career is now very promising and I feel like I could get very far (co-workers and superiors are all amazed at how much effort I do and how quickly I learn). 

But here's the problem. I feel like I'm slowly loosing touch of everything I truly like. The gigantic pressure I put on myself all the time oftenly makes me feel that I lost the sens of fun, and sometime passion. I feel I don't how to appreciate a lot of things anymore. 
I used to be super lazy, but I was passionate about a lot of things, even tough I wasn't the best person and my life wasn't going in the most successful direction.
I feel conflicted all the time, like trapped in this ""mantra"" I decided to adopt, constantly switching ON and OFF with this tought process. That might sound a bit crazy from the outside but this resume 99,9% of my life from the past 4 years. I'm struggling all the day to decide between ""Giving my best at everything and getting result and pleasing my peers and my loved ones"" or ""Doing whatever I want and go with the flow and being more natural and taking things as they come"". 
Obviously, I tought to myself that the answer was probably somewhere in the middle but I can't get to wrap my mind around this and I'm so used to just switch on and off. I had great times with both ""modes"". I'm afraid that stopping to put that much pressure on myself will risk my career and peroannalk relations with others. I'm afraid of discovering that, deeply, I don't care or like a lot of things I set myself into those past years.

I don't know how crazy or stupid all this might sound and I don't even know if I'm the right place th share all this (considering its nowhere near as bad as a lot of problem usually shared in this sub) but the fact that I feel it's killing me bit by bit and leading me to sometime suicidal toughts, I tought it could at least be a good idea to write it all down for me.  
Not sure what I'm expecting but I guess it was at least somewhat cathartic for me! 
Thanks for reading if you did!

45,"Interesting revelation from this past weekend... 

Background on me - I suffer from depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and a slew of other things. 

So at my friends house this weekend. A few weeks ago I admitted to her that I brokedown and had tried to kill myself (it's been a long time coming). She lost it and told her BF. He coached her on what to say to me. Then about two weeks later, he told her that he's been suicidal since he was a teen. So him knowing what to say to me thru her makes sense now. As does the type of person him and I are and how we act. Like, everything clicked. 

My friend has battled anxiety and depression since she was a teen. She's been on medication for it for longer than I have been. But she has NEVER even contemplated suicide. 

So, we have three people. All three are from three pretty different walks of life. All three are battling the same clinical diagnoses. Two out if the three not only aren't scared of death whatsoever but welcome it at times in the sense that it would be a way out... a way to leave all The B.S. behind and get out of the shit state of their lives. The third, in contrast, is terrified of death and can not even fathom how anyone could ever find it appealing or view it as a solution. 

Which leads me to the revelation .... isn't the human brain and how we are all wired differently absolutely fascinating? In theory, should all three of us have the same views/outlooks since we have the same clinical diagnosis and, in out adult lives, have come to be pretty similar? Yet the variation is vast. 

It's fascinating to me, really. Just thought I'd share...

54,"Hello community!

One year ago, I have been diagnosed professionally with ocd (obsessive/intrusive thoughts about my health), chronic depression and anxiety disorder. I have doing therapy with a psychologist and I am also taking ssri. I am not so stable. I have bad and good days. I don't remember exactly when my panic and anxiety attacks have started. I always remember myself being stressed out about everything. I find relaxing a very difficult activity for me. Unfortunately, I didn't seek for professional help earlier. But I think it's never too late. What triggered the situation that I will describe below is a misdiagnose by a doctor who wanted to perform surgery on me without doing ALL appropriate exams first and/or asking for my medical history. Eventually, I went to my personal doctor (and couple of other doctors as well), we did all the tests and repeated them for the appropriate amount of time and he told me that the original examination was a false positive, I definitely did not need surgery and I have nothing life-threatening. All of the tests came back negative. However, since I have the tendency to punish myself, I do not believe the doctors or the results. Fun fact: I am a scientist myself and I should know that should know where to draw the line regarding the validity of results.

Recently I came to realize that my compulsions are causing my most of my panic attacks. My compulsions consist on me checking a particular area of my body for possible disease signs. The area the stupid doctor wanted to perform surgery.  Here it how it works with my compulsions: If I give in, I either 1) get happy and satisfied for a short period (an hour at most) and then give in again. As a result, because I check myself extensively, I end up hurting myself unintentionally and I get pain that I get panicked cause I think that the pain is related to my imaginary diseases. or 2) I find a sign (pimple, scratch, cut, skin pore) that I think is not normal (always normal but cause I am not a doctor, I think it's not) and I have to run to the doctor or the hospital (if it's late at night). So basically my compulsion of checking myself leads me to either self harm and/or to more strong compulsions or both. 
If I don't give in to my compulsions, I get extremely panicked and anxious and I think that the world is going to end and I have infected everyone I love and now everybody hates me.

After talking with my therapist for over a year and given recent events, I decided I need to help myself get better. First I want to understand what are my mental problems. Second I want to change my way of life so I can reduce them. They affect my every day life and my relations with other people so much that I think I am getting crazy. 
So I am here asking for you for videos, audio and books that can help me understand and overcome my problems. 

More analytically:
1) Videos: videos explaining my mental problem and things to help me overcome it, guided meditation etc
2) Audio: playlists to listen during panic attacks, playlists for relaxation, guided meditation etc
3) Books: to understand my condition and how to get better.

Thank you in advance for your time.
Any recommendations will be much appreciated!

I don’t stick my chest out and chin up because I don’t want to have small talk, and I’m not interested in dominating a room with my presence.

65,"Hello,

I have been struggling with depression most of my life. I have had time periods, almost a full year, where everything was solid and right now not so much. So I felt my depression start to creep back in a couple of months ago. I went to my doc and asked him to put me on welbutrin xl 150mg, I was on this in college and it really helped.

But this time around is a completely different experience. My anxiety is totally through the roof. And throughout to say I am going from depressed to manic mode. Not to mention I can hardly concentrate for any period of time.

There is also nothing in my life currently that triggered the depression

I have an appointment with him in two days to get me the hell off this but I wanted to know if anyone else has made the move from welbutrin to another anti-depressant. What did you switch to? How long did you wait till you made the switch? Did you have to end up taking a second medication in the long run?

Overall, I need to not feel depressed, I have Xanax as needed, small 0.5mg dosage, and I need to be able to do generate at work, not have a dead sex drive and not eat everything in sight. Maybe I'm asking for too much?

68,"Title. Since about a few months I behave strangely when it comes to new items I get. Example: when I had a new watch, I doubted about how I should close the band, 'like this, or like that?' I kept telling myself. And when I finally made a decision about what way to close it, a few minutes later I would rethink it. It drove me crazy, even in bed I kept thinking wether I should do it like this or that, I couldn't stop it. After a week or 2, I let it go. Then I got some other item and the exact cycle happend again. I still have this with most  of the things, it really affects my daily life and it really drives me crazy. I appreciate serious answers about what this is and how to help it. Thanks alot.",24Oct2017,1

77,"I really have an issue shutting up. I always need to talk, say something funny or smart, something to grab people's attention. Yeah it works sometimes but a lot of the times I just end up sounding like a complete idiot. I never seem able to just shut up, I always need to know that other people think I'm funny smart etc. I don't like this, when I screw up it's embarrassing and the habit shows me that I have a dependence on the confirmation of other people. Any suggestions?",24Oct2017,1
78,"She hasn't eaten anything consecutively since 6th grade. I've been talking to her for a week or so about this, and this is what I've gathered:

- The last calories she had was chocolate milk.

- The last food she had was a ""bite of lasagna"" two Thursdays back.

- The last time her parents cooked (and she ate a full plate) was more than three weeks ago.

- She will not start eating ""until she gets skinny"" (She is skin and bone)

- She only eats meals when her parents cook, which is seldom. (Because her dad would threaten her if she didn't)

- She ""doesn't have a mental disorder"" (I didn't ask her directly. I said ""Now this happens to a lot of people all over the country and she said this)

- She is ""fine""

Today she passed out on the stairs. She's been woosy all week. She has been sleeping constantly and slacking in classes.



I'm concerned. Who can I go to? What should I tell her? The school counselors have pulled her in and then didn't even talk to her. I'm concerned for her well being but I don't want to be controlling.

Thank you.


By the way, I'm in Texas.",24Oct2017,5
