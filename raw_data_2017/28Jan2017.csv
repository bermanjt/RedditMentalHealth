I try to fit in but It just all feels forced and terrible, I freeze up, I retreat into myself where I dont even notice the time passing and then at my worst times I just want to scream and curl up Into a ball.
I have a history of anxiety and have taken things for it in the past but that never helped how I am around people.

I don't make friends easily and don't keep them very well either.

Is it possible that even though they checked themselves in they would get put in a ward anyway without the family being informed? Should I call?

What should I expect in general?

I really want to talk to someone about this in my friend circle, but I don't want to share this kind of sensitive info to people we know and I'm feeling super alone in general about this.",28Jan2017,3
2,"Hey guys :)

My mum has some serious problems in my opinion, not trying to make fun of her but I really want to help her. 

She didn't have the best childhood and after that some other traumas happened that seem to have affected her. 

She usually seems very detached and distant. Her two chronic diseases may be a reason for that as well, she is constantly afraid of causing pain with a motion. She has little to no self-confidence. Moreover, she recently told me she hears two people discussing with each other. I am not a professional but this doesn't sound healthy to me. Additionally, she is easily distracted and lacks concentration. She overeats and overspends, she has trouble setting boundaries. Most of the time it's impossible to have a proper conversation with her, she sometimes seems a bit childish (selfish, can't take on responsibility, talks about herself only,..). When I tell her she needs to get help as kindly as I possibly could, she nervously laughs it off, feels ashamed (of needing help? Being flawed? Idk) or at worst she starts crying. I could add more symptoms but I guess it isn't really necessary.

How can I make her actually want to go to therapy? I tried by saying she will be happy (have never seen her happy), she will lose weight, be able to afford nice vacations, become more concentrated, which really annoys her now. 

Thanks to everyone, having to see my mum suffer makes me feel kinda desperate",28Jan2017,0

I am already a fearful person,  but with the constant barrage of crises and bad news, well, I feel my mental health plunging. I feel myself stuck in this fear and blackness and I don't see hope. I am afraid and I am afraid for my mental health in a way that I haven't felt for a long time. I imagine I'm not the only one who feels this way. How are you caring for yourself at this time?

4,"Apologies, i don't know if this is the wrong sub to post in but, I don't know where else I could. As the title says, recently I've been struggling with the possibility that I may have Aspergers and was wanting to know how I would go about getting some answers. I was always considered the ""weird kid"" back in school and college, quite antisocial with only 2-3 friends, finding it impossible to even talk to anyone else. I've never really understood emotions all that well, I can't really grasp when people are happy or sad unless they ""spell it out"" for me, and I have trouble describing my own emotions and feelings, often I don't even know how or what I feel. Whenever someone is ""overly happy"", I can't help but analyse it, thinking what's the need to be that loud and ""in my face"" about it, when in reality there's nothing wrong with what the person is doing. Eye contact is especially difficult for me, I can't describe how it makes me feel just...uneasy and difficult. It's honestly infuriating that I find it so hard to look my girlfriend of 6 years in the eye, realistically it's not a hard thing to do but for me it's impossible. Noise is also a big issue for me, loud unexpected ones terrify me to the point of tears sometimes which sounds pathetic because it's ""just a noise"" but, I can't help it. At certain points in my life, I've just thought chalked it up to me being grumpy or just being a bad person.

How would I go about seeking answers or a diagnosis for this? UK based if that helps.",28Jan2017,0

9,"A little backstory first; Ok so I just had a miserable break with my girlfriend (LDR atm) almost a week ago. And I was planning my proposal and everything. I fucking love her. I believe shes *the* one. So I do truly love her and I could never muster my self up to hurting her. With words or physically. I'm super careful with my words. Or at least I like to think I am. So like I could not sleep without her. I had(had at the time, not anymore). And one night I went to bed early while she was playing games. I had woken up from a nightmare and was pretty distraught. But she didnt wanna help me. She wanted to help her friend with her friends issue. So I got upset, and went back to bed. Now here is where things get fuzzy. Reading back in our messages now I noticed I said awful and very aggressive and cruel things. Things I would never say. Even if we were bantering. And I have partial glimpse of her messages and stuff in my memory. but none of mine. none. I remember a picture she had sent me. That is the most vivid that I can remember getting. But throughout the argument I dont remember jack shit that I said. It was like I was not myself. Things were still relevant to my feelings for certain things. So they were not just random nonsense. I feel super guilty and basically like a hopeless dumbass because now im struggling to get her back. Another thing is, some of the messages that were sent from either of us, are like completely out of sync with my memory. Like I remember these messages from the morning. Like 8 or 9 am or something. But the time stamps on the messages are like 4 or 5pm. Can anyone give me some insight as to what could be happening? I cant let this happen again, as I'm sure it has happened before, but went unnoticed. 

TLDR: dont remember messages and the ones i do are out of sync with my memory and time. Can anyone help? ",28Jan2017,0

19,"I have an 8 year old daughter. Her father suffers from manic depression and bouts of paranoia and delusion. His delusions often lead to dangerous or violent behavior and result in him being incarcerated. He has been out of control and unable to see her for over a year now. Despite how long it's been she struggles regularly with his absence. I've been careful throughout her life not to expose her to his issues, so she has never seen him in anything but a positive light. Now that she is older she has noticed his absence and overheard things from other family members that have forced me to tell her the truth. I was also forced to file a restraining order and put her school on alert when he threatened to abduct her. Because of this I also had to have a conversation with her about her safety and not leaving with him if he approaches her. 

Unfortunately her grandmother also told her that her dad is fine and that I was ""making up stories."" Any time she has questioned her grandmother her grandmother has insisted that there is nothing wrong, told her she may be able to or should be able to see him, and otherwise undermined my efforts to help my daughter understand that he is unwell and unsafe. 

Now she is utterly confused and gets upset on a weekly basis for one reason or another. She keeps asking to write to him, though I have no idea where he is, how he is living, and have had numerous reports that he is manic and acting out in public. She also apparently brings him up in school regularly and writes about him for class assignments. She expressed an interest in writing about drug use with him as an example for a class speech in the near future, because her grandmother told her he had problems with drugs, which is true but not something I have ever or have ever wanted to discuss with her. 

I'm at a loss here. I don't know if I should be honest with her and explain exactly what I mean when I say he is ""unwell."" I don't know if I should be honest that he may very well be going to prison soon as a result of his last violent outburst (multiple felony charges including battery and false imprisonment). I don't know how to tell her that I am deliberately keeping her from her grandmother because the things she tells her are damaging and inappropriate. I don't know how to make her understand that standing up in front of her class and telling them her father has a drug problem is not a good idea, and that it's really not the issue, his mental health is. She's already in therapy to deal with this issue but it seems to be getting worse, not better. ",29Jan2017,1

21,"There's been numerous cases in the past where something will go wrong or I will have a misunderstanding with someone, and instead of directing anger at the other person or if I am upset with them, eventually all of that blame turns inwards, and everything was my fault.

Because almost everything is my fault, I could have acted better, predicted better, done one small thing better, but instead it is all my fault that things went wrong.

I wasn't strong enough, I'm not rational enough, I'm not mature enough, smart enough, successful enough, I'm just the fuck up.

Everyone else would have handled it better, everything must be my fault.

The decisions I made, inevitably made whatever happened my fault. Even if I couldn't predict them or if it was someone else's fault its mine for not reacting in a way that would have made them not faulting.

I can't control others or what they do, so if anything goes wrong it's my fault for not changing and adapting.

22,"I'm going to post something here that I posted yesterday in r/Anxiety 

I don't know what happened to me nor why I felt this way, and I thought I was over it today but I feel the same, I went outside and felt embarrassed of myself. 

Sorry for the long post.

Today I had a little fight with my mother. Today I felt like shit. Today I thought like I used to think a year ago. Today I went back to my insecure, January 2016 self who didn't feel worth it. Today I felt worthless.

I took a pill to help me sleep because I don't want to remember what I felt and thought. I felt to insecure because today my mother criticized everything I said and did. Everything was wrong.

I felt insecure, worthless, not good enough. I then saw myself in the mirror and saw what I saw last year, a huge beast who can't stop eating (even though I'm on my normal weight, and I KNOW that).

Last year I tried starving myself (and obviosuly failed because I'm such a shit-head) just to feel pretty, to feel like a person. I did lose weight, I haven't gained it back but for some reason my brain reactivated that horrifying side that kept saying ""everybody is looking at you, you're fat, hide yourself, go back to the gym you lazy shit, stop eating, don't be such a fucking whale"".

Even though this is very related to women (and I don't know why it is), it affects everybody. I'm a 19 year old guy who feels worthless but still keeps living and smiling because I remind myself everyday of how lucky I've been.

I don't know how to get rid of these thoughts, all I want to do is go to the gym and lose more and more weight, all I see is fat even though people tell me I'm skinny. What has my self worth become and WHY did this fight with my mother make me feel this way!!!

(I'm 179 cm and I weight 68 kg, I know I'm thin but I'm getting these horrible thoughts and right now I'm exhausted like I've never been and all I want to do is stay in bed forever).

23,"Hey everyone !

I just finished college. Those 3 past years were marked by apathy, living alone, missing classes and doing nothing else than playing video games, jerking off to porn and eating ice cream every day. I could beat depression and major illness on my own, and to still get my engineering degree. But it left me broken.

Fast forward 5 months (now), and I’ve healed physically, but I face major challenges. I have to get a job and get a job fast (engineering, Food Science) but…I can’t do it. I’ve sent 20 resumes in 5 months. I just don’t care. I don’t know what I want to do. I don’t know what I want to be. I spend my days on the computer, numbing myself from reality. I have no drive anymore and I have kind of accepted that I’m going to become homeless. During those three years in college I convinced myself I was a huge loser and developed a very negative self talk which convinced me I’m going to be homeless and die soon. So I spend my time thinking about it and preparing mentally, instead of working to get a job.

Overall, all I can say is I don’t care. I don’t care about finding a job. I don’t even care enough to do things that I would enjoy. I have no friends, I’ve been living alone for years now. It has been 3 years last week that I had sex and nobody had hold me or hugged me or told they liked me in those 3 years.

I have lost the intrinsic desire to move forward and to achieve things. I was once driven and motivated but I don’t see a point in anything now, and I have no clear vision of my future except homelessness and death (I tried to commit suicide in January 2015). I don’t even care about my hygiene or eating right or cleaning my room. I don’t do sports.

To put it in a nutshell: I know I should get a job but I don’t care about anything, and I don’t do anything with my time. Because I have no goal. I’m not driven. I have no reason to do anything. I know I don’t have much time left until my enumployment time gets too big to find a job but I don’t care. I go through life like a ghost, doing whatever presents itself to me. I lose myself in the internet and in my head. I do what people tell me to do but I don't do anything after deciding for it myself.",29Jan2017,1

26,"So here's the lowdown, I am on here because I have no family and no one to talk to in real life I have no friends and only one sister who has her own issues. I am having serious trouble with my wife, she said that I am a mean person and call her name's and all that which I will own up to it, I do. Now, however, she went online to talk to people and meet ""friends"" that now she has ""strong feelings for"" after only a week or two. She said he treats her the way that she wants to be treated and that he is a great guy. I caught a glimpse of what they were talking about and it got sexual and he sent her a pic of himself before he got into the shower. Really I am beyond stressed out, I am so heartbroken anxious and nervous to lose her, I dont want to lose her. She said if I act right I can get another shot with her. I have had so much heartbreak in my life from my mom dying at 14 to my dad leaving the house as I turned 16 and then I lived all alone in my house at 16 and at 19.5 yrs old I went to go to live with my aunt and uncle which they kicked me out because they accused me of drunk driving which I didn't, so at that point I still had two weeks until my ship date for marine corps boot camp so i was forced to sleep on park benches until I got into boot camp and finally succeeded in becoming a Marine. During the marine corps I did well got married and then the worst thing possible happened I got injured and gained weight like crazy because I couldn't run pt. So, because of this issue I was forced to get out after my 4 yrs after being ridiculed and single snout for being a piece of shit. And finally low and behold my shitty job where I make 32,000 a yr on an income supporting me and my wife where I get shit on daily, made fun of, harassed and really just downright embarrassed.

30,"I am 38 years old. Ever since I was a kid I have had Adhd with coexisting anxiety and depression. I was prescribed Adderall when I was 22 and severely abused it for 10 years, taking up to 14 tablets 3x per day monthly. I haven't taken any Adderall for the past 5 years but because of the consistent ongoing abuse my Adhd is still existing, and my anxiety and depression have gotten a lot worse. Symptoms are shakiness, tremors, panic attacks, fatigue, which I believe could very likely be adrenal insufficiency and neurological damage. As a result of all this I have been on disability for the last 7 years. I have been seeing a psychiatrist who I had prescribe Oxazepam for anxiety, which helps a lot but also slows me down. Also have been taking Zoloft for about 8 years and it is not helping at all. I have seen multiple psychiatrists for second opinions prior to the one I am seeing currently and they have no knowledge of the long term effects of stimulants or how to treat it, or they simply dismiss it and ask if I want to guess which antidepressant to try.

32,"I am in the legal profession so the use of and change to neutral uses of language has me really seeing terms in this area contextually feeding into stigma.  I also have bipolar disorder so I know that describing something as bipolar can contextually imply something totally different than the definition (i.e. bipolar ganglion) and can see the context of which it CAN be somewhat applicable socially.  And due to my situation



One example is persuasive and manipulative.  I find that I unknowingly get some rather defensive or confused responses to words I don't even specify intentions with.  I had to go through the gauntlet with this one person I know who, ironically manipulative in an unhealthy sense of the term.  But this occurs and I try to give examples and in the end say, see that was another example.  So I think maybe change that needs to happen needs to be on a different level.



I know narcissism in basic context is self-directed and has been described as healthy or unhealthy in context but is present in all of us.  I carelessly used it to described a couple traits we all have in some contexts that are very self directed and part of us wants to tell the other, yeah we know.  And my friend's sister and best friend went into warp speed smear campaign etc.  ""There's nothing worse a narcissist but when smile and admit it, it's the worst"".  I clarified it with most of them.  



I had to avoid a of those ""all of my ex boyfriends are sociopaths and narcissists"" types who were aggressively interested too.  Even though one didn't like a manic tirade of mine when said, ""birds of  a feather flock together.  So join reality and accept it and get a therapist"" and ranted and raved about people using that word like it's the modern Salem Witch Trials while sadistically sucking us into their misery.  And she ended up in therapy but I didn't how to handle it when that was the appeal.  (NOTE: I felt horrible later and that was on my part very inappropriate.  But sometimes these little things can be blessings in disguise)



And Narcissistic Personality Disorder doesn't even have to have behavioral narcissism associated with the obvious narcissism.  Martyrdom is very narcissistic and grandiose in the idea the extreme selflessness makes them better, stronger, society would fail without them.  I know a few and a lot of people feed into their denial but they are in much of the same way as insufferable as the more ""I'm the best"" types because they will often take the spotlight have that attitude"".  

But most people would probably feel bad about the gut feeling you get eventually until the ""I personally just need to be with more selfless, giving, charitable people"".  However, mention the idea of a world without the causes they take on, that callousness comes out.  Like Mother Theresa with the ""The Lords wants these people to be poor etc"" view.  I mean it's callous.  But she's not pops into your head.


So, sorry but these are things I see associated with this.   And the semantics can feed denial because my younger years were not the greatest.  But after rotten manic episodes, I immediately went into ""I refuse to apologize for a mental illness!! HOW DARE YOU??!!""  But that was short lived too as by the 3rd time, I realized I had to take some responsibility because it didn't feel completely okay unintentionally or intentionally harmful to others and not express more than ""well, I'm on meds"".  So it's to help a lot of us here too overall be be healthier.  Getting well overall sort of an overall thing",29Jan2017,3
33,"I am a very spontaneous and social person, not someone you would think has anxiety. I love people, have no trouble voicing my opinions or bonding with strangers. I do not consider having anxiety, since what I'm about to describe is more or less the only situation that gives me anxiety. That's why I am so lost about it.

Several times a day, I have flashbacks of things that I did/said that were maybe too spontaneous, or a bit outside the social norms. Like I said, I am very energetic, spontaneous, and maybe a bit weird, so I tend to say and do a lot of things on a daily basis haha.
It's rarely anything major ; My problem is not really that I behave in a way that's inappropriate. My problem is that I obsess over it afterwards.
When I think about those awkward things, I get physical reactions: shouting something, starting to scratch frenetically, having spasms in my arms/legs. 
I start mumbling, speaking to myself, having negative thoughts about myself, fearing how people reacted, what they think of me, etc..
It can be things that happened the same day, or years ago.

Is anyone suffering from the same thing? What do you think it is and what would you do?
I do not want to feel like I have to restrain myself...I don't want to become a transparent version of myself to avoid the flashbacks. I'd like to break free from them.

Yesterday, my SO of many years had a breakdown. I don't know what happened, but after dinner and TV, my SO wasn't making sense. Suddenly she was very scared, and that the world was going to end. I had to call the police for help, because I'm in new town trying to find work as a software engineer and don't know anyone. She is now admitted to the urgent mental health care, and being transferred to a hospital that can take her, because we don't have insurance. I'm not sure she is getting the care she needs. She didn't have any prior history of this, but she has been abused a long time ago that she seemed to have dealt with well.

She also has had a lot of stress due to medical school and if she was being accepted into residency. She has also a strong sense of wanting to help and even in her state of mania all she ask about is how can we make this world a better place, and what is stronger, love or hate. She calls me every few hours when she gets scared and asks these questions.

It hurts so much, and I don't know what to do. I really don't know what I am asking for either, but I do know that I need some help with my situation. I'm scared, because I don't want to loose her and I don't know what I can do for her either.

Update 2017/1/30: Hi everyone, and thank you for responding. I wasn't doing well yesterday, and it was overwhelming first time experiencing this with no warnings (visible to me). So it was extremely sudden, and to see her so frantic and confused is really hard. The feeling is that she isn't getting better, and that she isn't getting the care she needs is overwhelming. I did reach out, but they were closed. 

She is now transferred from urgent care to another place I feel is better. I'm hopefully she will get better, and I feel this is now manageable. I want to thank everyone for responding, and even though I didn't respond yesterday (as I was very sad), I did read it and it did make me feel better. So thank you to all of you!

Update 2 on 1/30/2017: I just visited her, and she is doing great. She is now aware, alert and even diagnosed her own condition. She is no longer confused, but will stay at the hospital for a little bit longer. We think it was severe lack of sleep inducing psychosis. Obviously we aren't sure yet, but either way we will manage.

Just for background, I am a fourth year media student who lives at home still, 23 years of age. I don't have a job or pay rent at home and my transport and college is covered by a grant. 

At home I have my mother and two siblings, and I usually babysit to make my mothers life easy, however lately that has become hard. I can't seem to keep my three year old sibling under control or stop temper tantrums so my mother has to constantly step in, making it difficult for her to relax or clean the house (its hard enough when I'm gone from 7 and back by 9 due to college hours and long distance with public transport. In addition to this, I am horrible with procrastination, I leave assignments to the last minute and never use my time wisely (I.e using free time for leisure instead of college work), and I scapegoat my siblings in my head, blaming them when its my fault, which results in me having some kind of angst when I should be more mature, which makes me feel awful when combined with my recent incompetence. 

At this point I don't know what to do to stop being stupid anymore. The best thing would be to use free time for doing work so the stress doesn't make me act like an idiot, which is doable and is a step that I should take rather than dwelling in self pity, but I still seem to ignore that idea and still cause problems for others and it makes me want to die because even though it would hurt people more, my selfish desires are more important I guess. 

But I want to stop this so I thought I'd make a post to ask how to deal with rampant procrastination and angst or how do I better followy own advice. If this is not appropriate here, then maybe down vote and ignore or the mods can remove it. Sorry if this doesn't fit here.",29Jan2017,3
