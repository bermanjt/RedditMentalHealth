Science hasn't even proven the cause of it yet, and I'm super terrified whenever I'm stressed out, because I heard that stress can cause it.",29Aug2017,1,

Can I trust these tests? I read that some disorders can be confused with others but I dont know if these are some of those. I did multiple tests on different sites but they all showed the same thing. I can relate to the anxiety disorder but Im not sure about the others.

7,"My mother suffers from alcoholism and is very verbally and (used to sometimes be) physically abusive.

For the past few years, my gay thoughts have come and gone. They usually come when I'm turned on. I have not done anything physical with a guy, but I have thought about trying some things (none that involve anything intimate because that sounds gross to me. Mostly things that involve rubbing penis or looking at penis.) I have catfished guys to get nudes (for myself, I don't share). I also only like guys that are female-like (skinny, no hair, no muscle, white).

Also, is it gay if I decide to act on it and have sex with one?
(penetrating me only)

I have a girlfriend too btw and have done things sexually with her besides sex yet.

More importantly, is it bad for my mental health if i decide to act on these thoughts?

Do these thoughts show any sign of mental damage?

 I used to really love to draw. I would crave it so much. And then something happened. I don't know what. I used to think it was just an art block that I'd get over. Buts its been so long and I still can't bear to draw. I have to force myself since I occasionally do commissions. Everything else feels about the same. 

I pretty much wasted this summer playing games. 

I'm going into university but feel nothing but apathy towards it. In fact I'm slightly annoyed with Uni starting soon. I haven't been excited about anything. 16th, 17th , 18th birthday. They all felt like just normal days. But when I was a kid I remember not being able to sleep because I was that excited for my birthday. 

I really was hoping it was just a phase but I've felt like this for just so long. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just wasting all my days but I can't see what I want to do anymore.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety for ten years. I have been treated for an eating disorder and that's under control. About a year ago I switched to effexor for depression and was added hydroxyzine as needed. 

The past few months I have been feeling progressively worse, culminating in a panic attack during my first grad school class. I hate my job. Everything seems pointless. I don't know what to do or where to go. Honestly, I want to stop existing because this is just so damn exhausting. 

I'm working two jobs to get myself through grad school. My dad went blind a year ago. I feel like I'm drowning. And I don't know how to get out.

19,"I have such a hard time connecting with people; even people that I have known for a long time.  When I'm with friends, I laugh and have fun and joke around and most people would say I'm a fun guy to be around. Always smiling and goofing around.  But the truth is, I'm just really good at putting on a show.  I've been dealing with depression for a while now.  It is worst when I'm alone.  I long for a real connection with people, but I just have a hard time finding/creating a good connection.  I'm 20 years old and I don't even think I've ever had a best friend. 

When I hang out with friends, I feel almost out of place. Like I don't feel any human connection.  Like I wander if they really care about me or if they just let me hang out with them.  I don't ever feel emotionally attached to people, I want to; but I just rarely do.  I mean I do love my family.  But sometimes I get inside my thoughts and start to convince myself I'm useless.  And that I'll never amount to anything. And that nobody will ever really want me around. It's like a weird floating feeling, like I'm just floating around in a big ocean and I'm getting closer and closer to drowning. 

I would love to have a girlfriend, but it's hard for me to put myself out there.  I see girls and I just think to myself, ''why would she want me?''.  My biggest dream in life is to get married and have kids one day, to have my own family; my biggest fear is that I'll never have that.  

I think that's really the root of my depression - not being able to connect with people.  I love making people laugh, it's my favorite thing in the hole world.  Making someone smile and feel good is the best feeling ever.  I just wish I could make myself feel good. 

It's almost gotten to the point where I've... ''accepted'' being alone.  I tend to spend most of my time by myself.  Occasionally going out once a week to have some bit of social activity, but it never really means anything.  

Maybe some of you can help me understand what's wrong; and help me fix it.  I'm drowning in it.

I don't want to go into too many details to protect his privacy but he worries about the future from a career standpoint and is convinced that he's never going to find a job and that he's not cut out for his field even though he has an amazing work ethic and is really good at what he does.

I'm doing my best as we're kind of long distance at the moment (I see him once a week, though I'm moving closer to him soon), but I feel like offering to call him and texting him and giving him space when he needs it isn't enough. He doesn't open up to me as much as he should, so when he does I know that he's really struggling. I'm so used to what helps me through a panic attack or a depressive spiral, and those things are different for him. I don't know if there's more I can do, or if I just need to support him while he works through things himself.

So guys, what can others do for you that help you when you're having a bad mental health day? How can I be a more supportive girlfriend?

23,"I haven't been in therapy for my anxiety and depression for at like 6 years now. I just started going again last week after waiting a month for Kaiser to find me a therapist. I was nervous, but really hopeful. She has been a therapist for 40 years and this might be the problem, but during our first session she was responding to texts and she took a phone call. Meanwhile I'm in the preliminary ""tell me as much as you can about why you're fucked up in the next 45 minutes"" phase and it really jarred me when she asked me to pause because she thought the cruise line she just booked a getaway with was calling. 

I keep a pretty standardized schedule with very little downtime because said downtime immediately allows me to get depressed. So, it's especially important that I can count on my therapy sessions to be reliable and pretty constant. Tonight my therapist texted me and said she needed to cancel our second session. 

I had a really horrible night last night. Painful sadness and bad thoughts, and having initiated this  therapy process has left me raw and open-ended and in the midst of revisiting all the terrible parts of my life. 

No one seems to see or care how delicate this is. 

Is this behavior something I should overlook out of desperation or should I fire her and request that Kaiser find me someone else?

I have literally no one to talk to about this. The girl I'm dating is on a trip and IDK if she just doesn't want to deal with it, or she is just really busy and can't focus on anything but what she's doing on her trip. And she has recovered from major depression over the last year and I don't want to put any of my sadness on her.

24,"I have a friend who is like family to me and lives with me. He is 19 and has lived with me since he was 17. I take care of him and am pretty much a cross between a parent/friend/older sibling. We are close enough that I was planning on doing an adult adoption in the coming months so we could be legally family. He doesn't have a close relationship with his father who is an alcoholic and his mother is deceased.

He recently started seeing a new therapist. Maybe for the past 6 weeks or so. For the past 4 weeks or so things have been getting really bad. He agreed I could come and see his therapist so we could discuss some sort of crisis plan however the appointment is not for another week and I have not met the guy yet. 

The last few days things have gotten very bad. I found out recently he has been hearing voices and has not told any of the ER doctors or his therapist. He has been threatening suicide to his girlfriend. He has bought rope and has been choking himself with it (I just found that out today). And then shit started getting really weird. And I haven't mentioned the half of it.

He refused to go to the hospital and he is not quite at the point where I can call the police and expect them to do anything. I get why he refuses to go to the hospital. He was there a month ago and my only description is Negligent. I'm in the middle of helping him file a complaint. 

I have zero idea what to do. I was thinking about writing an email to his therapist explaining what has been going on and asking him what I should do. Is this morally ok? I don't want to breach a line of trust you can't come back from.

I think everything is ok tonight now because apparently he passed out while on the phone with his girlfriend. He had been hysterically sobbing. I suspect he took a bunch of anxiety meds or sleeping pills and they all finally kicked in. His girlfriend called me and asked me to check on him because he just kind of drifted off.

41,"My mind's a master piece of consequences of actions I am forced to partake in. A canvas with the last stroke being painted only for the palm to smear the paint. It's like clocktower constantly ticking, greased with gasoline of  ridiculous assignments. Trying to explain rituals to someone without the disorder is like trying to telepathically explain sound to someone that cannot hear, or sight to someone with no vision. It's an controlling relationship with no escape. It's a series of misleading finish lines enticing you that the battle is almost over, only for deja vu to place you back at start. Chemicals can not restrain it, substances cannot force it into submission. 
It's like leaving a candle lit and leaving home, or placing a lit cigarette on the arm of your chair. You know exactly how to prevent disaster from happening with such simple tasks. OCD is a constant thought of following through with the relatively normal, or absurd preventative actions. Check the stove before your house burns down, lock the door, check it, check it again, and again. Tonight could be the night someone breaks in and kills your family. Climbing into a bed only to be bombarded with overpowering thoughts of rituals you need to complete to elude grave consequences. Your mind is a car hydroplaning through heavy downpour  with no brakes, only a steering wheel and gas pedal. Sure a chemical can force you into submission, but it only silences it along with every other thought and feeling. It only makes driving in the car less scary, you're still in it, except now you're the passenger trying to unfog the windshield with only your hands. The tasks, prevent bad from happening. Put the cigarette in an ash tray, blow the candle out. Don't let this be the day you attempt to become a survivor and overcome your  disorder, it could impact your life forever. Did you check on your kids before going to bed? Are you sure? Is the window locked? When you checked on them, did you make sure they were breathing? What if a blanket is obstructing their airway? What if they had a string, or necklace, or ribbon that gets caught and strangles them? What if they snuck food to bed and they choke to death. What if tonight's the night you decide to stop catering to the abuse your disorder has submitted you to, and then....it happens. The death, the fire, the choice you made not to check will have repercussions on you, and those who surround you forever. Are you really so selfish not to listen to your mind, to reconstruct fate to being positive, and safe? Stay hostage to your brain, it has capabilities beyond belief.

5 Facts Everyone Gets Wrong About Depression
By Mark Hill. January 21, 2014.

I was diagnosed with clinical depression about two years ago. Sadly, this didn't lead to me beginning a wacky romance with a free-spirited girl who taught me to embrace life and love myself for who I am. I just started taking prescription drugs, made a few lifestyle changes, and felt smugly justified about listening to Joy Division.

All the time I spent not Silver Linings Playbook-ing it up made me realize that a lot of what I thought I knew about depression was about as accurate as what elementary school children know about where babies come from. If you haven't experienced mental illness for yourself, there's a chance you believe ridiculous things like ...

5: Depressed People Are Constantly Miserable and Alone

Despite what we see in pop culture, depression is not a constant parade of doom and despair. That's one of the reasons people have so much trouble noticing that their friend is depressed -- how could Steve be depressed when he hosted such a smooth and bubbly orgy last week?

People will often feel at their best when they're socializing, because life's problems fade into the background when a stranger buries their face in your junk. But when you're alone, curled up in a ball of fear and panic like a kitten cuddling with the yarn ball of sadness, that's when depression fucks you over. Your friends aren't there to see it, and you don't want to talk to them about it because your brain is telling you that the shits they give will be precisely zero.

There will also be times when you feel fine on your own but miserable with friends. Your mood almost seems to be random, like your brain is playing roulette with your emotions and it's had too many comped drinks. That may explain the public nudity charges, but it doesn't really fly with a judge. Trust me on that one.

Even when you're being treated, you're not always going to be at 100 percent. I have days where I wake up and feel like I'm going to rip life a new Saturday, but on other days I lie in bed for hours because the only thing I think would be worth getting up for is throwing myself in front of a bus made out of swords. Then there are the days where I do nothing but eat Oreos and masturbate. That has nothing to do with the depression; I just really like eating Oreos and masturbating. I call it cookies and cream. I'm not apologizing for that joke.

The point is that when you're depressed, you're in a constant battle with your dumb brain for control of your life. You can win and turn those crappy days around, but you have to know the fight is happening. Don't assume the battle is won, or that there isn't even a battle going on. You may be fighting for the rest of your life. Depression is the Warhammer of illnesses, basically.

4: Depression Just Means Being Sad

When you hear that someone's depressed, you assume they're sad, because duh, it's right there in the name. It's not called happission. But while most depressed people do feel like they're having a week-long case of the goths, it punches everyone's crotch differently.

Some people end up with an anger trigger that the Hulk would consider extreme. That's because one way to feel better about yourself is to make other people feel like shit, so a nice bout of telling your neighbor's kid that his finger paintings look like they were done by a quadriplegic chimpanzee can be just the thing to pick you up. Sure, you're still depressed, but at least you're not a stupid idiot that can't even paint a simple kitty cat. This is especially problematic, because friends and family will be less enthusiastic about reaching out to someone who might bite their hand off.

Contradictory symptoms are part of what makes depression difficult to detect. You might have trouble falling asleep or you might oversleep, and either way you might not realize that it's part of a bigger problem. I was sleeping until noon on weekends for months before I started to wonder if it wasn't only because I was staying up late to alphabetize my pornography.

I also lost a lot of weight, because when I'm having a bad day, a couple handfuls of blueberries and Cheerios seems like a good meal. That's not a joke, that was literally my supper on several occasions. And I found myself fidgeting like I had spent the night in a hotel overrun by bedbugs, even on the days when I hadn't replaced my blood with heroin.

That's just me. Others might find themselves having trouble remembering things, or gaining weight, or having trouble remembering things, or listening to blues music and smoking cigarettes in the rain, or having trouble remembering things. And of course these all add up to create new problems -- for example, it's hard to get motivated to take care of all your mundane day-to-day tasks when you're sad, tired, and lacking nutrients from two-thirds of the food groups.

And then there's the reduced sex drive. I don't get laid, so I didn't really notice any difference, but sexual side effects do affect many depressed people. If you're in a relationship and can't make Mr. Smith visit the hat shop (is ... is that a sex metaphor? I'm really bad at sex, you guys), your partner might be unsatisfied or worried that you find them unattractive. And then you'll worry that you're making your partner unhappy, and then you'll be unhappy, and then you'll be even less in the mood to bring your horse to water.

Even your libido melting away like a Popsicle in the sun isn't a guaranteed side effect. One study found that some depressed women have more sex, because they're using the fun of orgasms to fight depression's other symptoms, which raises the obvious question of how I go about joining their support group.

Everyone's heard that antidepressants are a scam. And not just from Sunshine Flower, the hippie who runs the local food co-op, but from the mainstream media. Often it's accompanied by a scary statistic that says more people in America are on antidepressants than water, or a commentary about how in the good old days people didn't need Big Pharma shoving pills down their throats. You even see it in pop culture. Garden State is a movie about a man whose life improves after he stops taking his prescribed medications, and we all know that Hollywood would never lie to us.

First of all, depression rates are rising because we're getting better at diagnosing it. It's the same reason a lot more people were identified as mentally handicapped after people stopped assuming a donkey kicked them in the head as a child.

It's true that in some cases antidepressants are not effective. That's because the human brain is immensely complicated, and we don't know much more about it than the monkeys knew about the monolith in 2001. You're trying to fix a biological computer, not a tangled Slinky -- of course the same treatment isn't going to work for everyone. But for some people antidepressants absolutely do help, and it's irresponsible to claim otherwise. It's like saying that because cancer screening doesn't have a 100 percent effective rate there's no point in getting checked.

The science behind antidepressants is complicated, heavily debated, and poorly understood. I'm not going to get into it, in part because any medicine beyond a splint is basically wizardry to me. But the real issue is that people misunderstand what antidepressants are supposed to accomplish. They're not magical feel-good drugs that wipe away all your problems just in time for you to win the big game; they're one part of a multifaceted treatment process. A long and tedious part -- it can take months of experimentation to determine what drug or drugs in what dosages are appropriate for each person, because again, brains are hard.

People who are anti-antidepressants say things like half of all people who try them quit after four months because they're not getting results. Well, maybe that's because it can take six weeks just to figure out if they're working, never mind the time spent fiddling with the prescription to get it just right. If you're expecting to cure a major mental illness in less time than it takes to play an NFL season, you may be a different kind of crazy.

The point of antidepressants isn't to solve all of your problems; it's to keep you from feeling overwhelmed so you can solve them yourself.

2: Depressed People Just Need to Snap Out of It

People who argue that antidepressants don't work are also eager to tell you that mental illness is a hot new trend, like twerking, but somehow actually less sad. It's cool to be depressed, because you can act miserable all the time but get mad when people call you out on it. It's free rein to be an insufferable jerk. Wow, depression is awesome!

But if all that pretend illness is stressing you out, don't worry -- there's a solution. According to one of the scions of journalism at the Daily Mail, ""It's called self-empowerment and costs absolutely nothing."" Ignoring the fact that ""self-empowerment"" is often as meaningless as telling someone to synergize their paradigms, the author's what we'll generously call an argument is that people who are depressed just need to get over themselves and move on. Shit, so if I don't want to be depressed, I just need to stop being depressed? Why didn't I think of that?

Admittedly, the Daily Mail is such low-hanging fruit that it's practically a potato. But it's an attitude that's depressingly easy to find (see what I did there?). Here's an article from the Daily Caller that argues that depressed people should fight their woes with a stoic attitude and good old-fashioned prayer, instead of wasting valuable tax dollars on stupid things like ""treatment."" And here's the Daily Mail again, with an article that's basically the written equivalent of a ""Deal with it"" gif.

It's nice that these editorials are limited to sites read by people who think the president is a homosexual communist, but it's easy to find them on forums, or in comment sections, or coming out of the mouth of some mouth breather at a coffee shop. And not only are they wrong, they're dangerously wrong.

The message is ""Depression is fake, so if you have it, it's your own fault."" Because that's just what the mentally ill need to hear -- that the problem lowering their quality of life is imaginary and self-inflicted. That will make them feel better! Or it will damage their personal lives or careers, or contribute to suicide rates. You know, either/or.

Then you have people blaming America's mental health system for mass shootings. Well, there's a mixed message -- if you have depression, you're probably faking it, but if it's real, then you're a mass murderer waiting to happen. I'm not saying that the mental health system doesn't need improvement, but maybe not treating the mentally ill as either liars or ticking time bombs would help, too.

Most people, like the intelligent and no doubt incredibly attractive folks reading this, know better. But mental illnesses are heavily stigmatized, and it doesn't take much to put someone who's already feeling irrationally ashamed of himself in a bad place. So if you ever feel the urge to tell someone to just get over their depression, stop and imagine what would happen if you told that to a person with, say, a broken leg or a cartoonishly large, life-disrupting penis.

1: Only Women and Old People Get Depressed

Our friend from the Daily Mail mentions a fellow who argues that men face a stigma when it comes to admitting to mental health problems. But don't worry, guys -- we're only sad because many women are now making more money than us. And that's just karma for all the years we were keeping women down, so don't expect any pity! It takes a special kind of stupid to argue that a stigma doesn't exist by perpetuating it, but as Mark Twain once said, ""Nobody ever lost a dollar by underestimating the intelligence of the Internet.""

It's true that women are about twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression, but that's not because hack comedians were right all along about their brains working differently. The most common theory is that social factors discourage men from seeking help. Manly-man men aren't supposed to suffer from wimpy emotional problems like a stupid girl -- if they're feeling down, they should hike into the wilderness and shoot something. Men who talk about their feelings are basically giant pussies.

So while most women are getting treatment and support, men are prone to dealing with their problems through substance abuse, bouts of violence (remember how that's one of the symptoms?), and the medically unsound practice of suicide. It's quite possible that women are still more susceptible to depression -- the very nature of the problem makes it difficult to get accurate statistics, much like how the world has yet to produce an accurate study on the average penis size. But thinking that half of the population is immune to depression based on their genitalia is a little different from thinking that half the population is immune to prostate cancer.

Teenagers face their own problems when it comes to mental health, because when most people hear a teenager say they're depressed, they assume it's because that slut Steve from math class dumped them. While it's true that Steve is, like, the biggest whore, there can be more to the story than that. So while some teenage depression will sort itself out with a daily dose of two to three bad poems and five servings of Linkin Park, other cases are every bit as severe as what adults face.

But teens are hesitant to seek treatment, because they falsely assume there will be too many obstacles. Maybe they're worried they won't be taken seriously or that the Internet will call them emo, or maybe they don't want to tell their parents about it. Or maybe their brains are simply convincing them that it's not worth the effort. Remember, many of them are experiencing this for the first time in their lives. To them, this feeling is just another part of living, like dealing with their dad's insatiable desire to see the return of grunge.

The days when you're able to put your own brain in a headlock and punch the world itself into submission are awesome, but there will also be days where nothing can stop you from feeling like a pre-montage Rocky. Don't make it harder on yourself or your loved ones by believing any of this crap.

53,"As the title says, I want to know how to identify if I'm relapsing, and how to tell when it's not just ""going to pass""

I have been medicated for depression and anxiety for the last two years. I also take meds for sleep which were working wonders but currently aren't really helping at all. Before I started the meds, I also started therapy, which continued for just under a year.

The last few months, I have felt SO well I don't quite now how to describe it. I have been able to undertake things I wouldn't have managed a year ago; made positive steps to improve my life; took up hobbies again and became more social. It's been slow, but tangible progress. I started to think it was over.

For just over a week now I've felt significantly different. Small things nag at me in a way they haven't for a long time. If I sleep at all, it's tense and disturbed and full of bad dreams. I can't hold on to thoughts anymore - it's like there's background noise in my brain that stops me from doing so. I feel low and am scared of going lower. 

I'm terrified that I'm slipping back to the horrible place I was in before, but I think it's too soon to really tell. How long do I hold on to see?
I worry that I'm just overreacting to normal ""bumps in the road"", but something is different. I've had some tricky times during this period I've been well, but the way I reacted to them is not how I'm reacting now.

So where's the tipping point?  When do I tell someone I feel weird or go back to my GP? I feel like I don't have the ability to know anything other than that this isn't right....",29Aug2017,1,

 I've been dating this amazing girl for 5 days so far and she just recently told me she has ADHD  and bipolar.
 
I'm really hoping somebody could help educate me on the things that I should look out for, my biggest worry is if these illnesses cause people to lie or be unfaithful she is moving pretty fast we've only been dating for 5 days and on the first day I met her we made out and she said she loved me was it her illness that made her say this?

I can deal with things like anger or her being violent but I don't think I can forgive lying and cheating.

I know she used to go to therapy I don't know what for she stopped that when she moved here. She has diabetes and really bad anxiety but stopped taking medicine for that.

60,"I get intense motion sickness if I ride in a car or bus for more than an hour. Found out about dramamine and it's been incredibly helpful for that.

Recently I've been using it to treat nausea caused by hangovers. It does help (kind of depends on the hangover) but I noticed that I've been EXTREMELY depressed on those days. I do feel ""meh"" if hungover, maybe even a little depressed, but the dramamine hangovers were bad enough to make me want to cry and have absolutely no motivation to continue anything going on in my life anymore.

I've just noticed this today since I am somewhat hungover, feeling meh but certainly not depressed, assuming maybe it's because I didn't take dramamine this time. I'm avoiding it since the depression is actually way worse than the hangover itself.

Is this a side effect of dramamine, or something about it that reacts with the hangover somehow? It's been a while since I've taken it for actual motion sickness, so don't remember what my mood was during that time.",29Aug2017,1,

63,"My name is Matt. Like most people who advocate for / work to improve mental health resources, I'm no stranger to trauma. To preface this post: I am in therapy. I have good, loving people in my life. This is not a plea for help. 

The main reason that I'm writing this post is that I'm, well, terrified of social media. But, as an indie game developer, social media is critically important to getting word out about your games.  So this is an exercise in putting myself out there, and facing those fears. It's also an attempt to start a conversation. After all, issues of mental health will only remain taboo for as long as people remain unwilling to talk about them.

Seven years ago, I worked for Microsoft at the highest tier of customer service. It was a job that I was deeply proud of, as well. My team was handled the cases that no other rung of the customer service ladder could solve. We were given much more broad authority to solve these problems than anyone else in the company. 
 
Microsoft rolled out a security update for the XBox 360 that changed the whole function of my team. It incorrectly shut down a lot of people's online access by misidentifying them as pirates.  The issue effected ~30,000 consoles or so. 
 Somehow, this entire problem fell onto my team of 8 people. And for two months, the company ordered us to lie about it. To convince mothers, calling on behalf of their 3 and 5 year old kids, that those kids MUST have done something that broke the EULA. 
 I had to convince the elderly, who just used the thing to watch Netflix, that they had somehow broken the rules, and there was nothing I or anyone else at Microsoft would do for them.

Then, one of these customers found a most effective way to fight back. You see, my team used our real names. And we gave our customers direct access to us through phone numbers and email addresses. It turns out that this is more than enough for an angry customer to figure out... well, almost everything about you.
  On support websites where people were asking for help, he started posting my contact info - that I had gotten him back online, with no problems, and if they just called me, I'd do the same for them!
 And on gaming media sites, he posted attack posts, saying that I was the one behind the WHOLE thing. That I had personally banned 30,000+ consoles from online activity. If they wanted someone to blame, he was only too happy to provide my contact info to them, too. 

 It took less than two hours before things fell apart for me. My phone line and email address were automatically shut off by Microsoft's internal servers because of how much traffic was coming in. My cell phone was ringing constantly. My personal email addresses, my Facebook account, everywhere I had an online presence, I was suddenly completely under assault from all sides. 

 Two days after that, I remember getting home from work. I was a wreck. Already an insomniac since puberty, I hadn't slept since the whole thing started. I had no appetite. Work was hell, and I couldn't even talk with most of my friends or family, since my phone and emails had had to be deactivated. I only got word out to my sister, and asked her to tell the rest of my family what was up.

I got out of my car, that day, went to my mailbox, and found a handwritten letter sent to me. I was thrilled, actually. It wasn't a bill or spam mail, or anything like that. I assumed it was from family, or a friend. 

Inside was a note, handwritten as well. It read simply, ""We know where you live. Now you know.""

 It was the first of many. They started showing up at work, too, including a couple of mysterious boxes that were instantly turned over to the police. I never found out what, if anything, was inside. 

  I'm a pretty self aware guy. I tend to be very empathetic, and I've advocated, for most of my life, about the benefits of psychological research, and the need for a better understanding of the mind. I've been through a lot of other difficult times. 

 I've struggled with depression and anxiety at times. But I've also always been willing to seek help and be open with others about my experiences. 

 This issue, though, the terror I still feel, when I post something anywhere online, when I act as anything other than a digital ghost, is something I haven't dealt with for seven years. 

 For most of that time, I've been unemployed. And, around that, I've had some of the most terrible work experiences out there. And it's largely rooted to what happened to me, back in 2010. 

 The truth is that I'm terrified of having a job. I'm terrified of applying for jobs. I am, I think, terrified of being out in the world. Of feeling exposed.  

 And not for nothing. The police arrested two people, before the end of my experiences with Microsoft, who had personally come to my apartment to threaten me. I mean, let that sink in, if you will. Not once, but twice, both times in the middle of the night, I was awoken by someone attempting - unsuccessfully, thank all that's sacred - to force my apartment door open. 

 Why? Because they were angry enough, about not being able to play games online, that they believed a stupid rumor and decided to physically assault someone over it. 
 
 And you know what the real irony is? I was one of the key voices in getting Microsoft to admit fault. I risked my job, repeatedly, telling executives the ugly truths about the whole situation, that they did not want to hear. 
 I was the person, directly, who convinced Don Mattrick (the head of Xbox at the time) that nothing short of an apology and an attempt at reparations was going to make this go away. 

 In short, I was on their side, even as hundreds of them tried to scare me, intimidate me, and even invade my home. 

And, even now, writing this down, the thought of pressing the 'submit' button is both thrilling and terrifying. But I will. Because, at the end of the day, I want to work towards understanding why people would do such horrible things, and how we can work together to make sure those kinds of incidents don't happen to anyone else. 

 My name is Matt, and I'm terrified of social media. And I'm terrified of work. But I will not be a prisoner to those fears any longer. And I hope, if you've read this far, that you'll join me in stepping out from behind those fears, to talk about what frightens us.
