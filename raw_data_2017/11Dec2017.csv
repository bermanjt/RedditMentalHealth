0,"Okay so i've been dealing with alot of shit latley with my family and living situations and relationships with people I live with. I live with my father and two sisters. We tend to get along but our lives are different. They both work and have significant others and are usually not home and when they are they sleep or relax after a long day. I on the other hand am agoraphobia so I don't get out much, especially in the winter because my anxiety and depression seem to be 10x worse. Okay so anyways, my mother doesn't live here because she and my dad were not getting along and we all argued and told her to leave that it was toxic how she would emotianlly manipulate us. She left to go live with her parents August of 2016. When I was going though the motions of being first diagnosed with OCD at 7, depression and panic disorder at 12 and ect, my mom was my rock. I was always afraid if I wasn't with her she would die or get in a accident so I was attached to her alot. I hated going to school and being away from her incase something happened. My first panic attack and expierence with anxiety was rough too. I thought I was dying and every panic attack was rough until I realized how to realize that I was not going to die. Not having her here home was hard but I never said anything because i'm not the only one who lives here. Anyway, I had a bad bad bad panic attack on Thanksgiving and the depersolaziation was bad and I remember being on my bed saying ""I want my mom She knows how to make me feel better"" and its not like my dad or sisters don't but they tell me things like ""think about something else, get over it, or you'll be fine"" which DOES not help. I got stuck in this motion thinking that I will not survive any more panic attack or anxiety attacks without my mom back home. I think something snapped in me after 2 years of not saying anything about needing her. We texted back and forth and my anxiety was so damn high and I was asking my dad and sisters to let her come back and that I wouldn't get better without her here. They said well you can call her or visit her. I could not leave the house with this much anxiety. They didn't get it. That I needed her here. That was stuck in my head and I wanted my way. I didn't want to face another awful panic attack like that without her here. I kept doing things to convince them. I was losing it. I was convinced that maybe if they could see how bad I was they would let her come back. All I kept hearing was ""its not going to happen.I cannot live with her we don't get along."" ""No this is not about you think about how we feel"" I was just worried I'd get worse and she wouldn't be here to help. I kept trying to get their attention. I'd get mad. When they went to bed I would throw things at the wall so they'd wake up and see how I was suffering. I'd tell my dad I can't do this anymore. I told him that in his room then ran to my room and I cut myself (literally not even just scratches) because I needed them to see what I needed. My dad and sisters grabbed me and said ""WHY DID YOU DO THIS?!"" and I cried and said ""I want my mom!"" They all got mad and said ""Oh okay so throw us under the bus because we don't help you enough?!"" Which made it worse. I decided to go to the hospital. They have be .5 of Ativan and I told them about my anxiety and the family situation and obviosult they can't control what goes on at home but I told them about my thoughts and my OCD and how I need my mom but she's not home. I spoke to the crisis councleer all while my mom and dad were just arguing the whole time in the room with me while waiting and I kept trying to get them to figure it out so my mom could come home. They did the thing, said I was not a harm to myself (I wasn't. I was not suicidal I was just full of anxiety and I was mad) and I went home and to follow up with the crisis team. It didn't get better and nobody could see I needed my mom so I told my dad i'm running away. I couldn't stay in this house where nobody cares that im suffering and wont let my mom come home. I didn't run I just hid in a field a bit away from my house and when nobody took me seriously I went home. I was still mad and scared and anxious and just full of every emotion. I told everyone in this house to leave me alone. To not talk to me that i'll be out of this house soon and they don't have to care. (I'm hopefully getting an apartment with my mom soon) So they didn't. They didn't ask how I was, didn't check on me ect. I complained to my mom who bitched to my dad ect ect. It went like that for a week and I isolated myself. My mom came over to stay a night with me and I hated it because that's not how its supposed to be. She's supposed to be living here not visiting. She told me she was going to move her stuff back in and come back. The next morning my sisters found out and said ""HELL NO WE CANT HAVE YOUR MANIPULATIVE ASS BACK"" and all hell broke loose. I stopped talking and stared at the wall hoping they'd think that it was really bad and she could come back. My grandparents came to pick my mom up and my grandmother was yelling about how awful my sisters were treating my mother and how they were talking to her. Everyone started yelling and swearing and all while I was laying in my bed hoping this would go my way. I kept hearing my sister who I don't always get along with just talking crap to my mom and yelling in her face. I just got up and walked downstairs and I punched her in the face. I was pissed. She was making decisious for everyone about my mom coming back or not. We then pulled eachothers hair and fought and then I went back up to my room. I stopped talking to everyone and secluded myself in my room only to leave to get water , food (which was hard to even eat and has been for almost 2 months because my anxiety gets so bad I lose my appetite and dry heave) and to bathe when I had the energy. I was crying and just a anxious mess. Constant panic attacks and I felt like I could never talk to my family again. They told me that I told them to not talk to me and I did because I was mad but I thought they would realize how bad I was and try to help. They didn't. Okay so this brings me to the main point that has been bothering me. After the fight I started getting intrusive thoughts. I kept being scared that I would get so mad at my sister that I would snap and kill her. I would never hurt anyone. I saw something on tv about somebody who killed somebody and instantly thought ""oh my god me and my sister have been mad at eachother what if I could do that to her!?"" I then kept panicking on this thought over and over for days. I avoided her cause I was scared of the thoughts. I remember she was trying to talk to me and I was scared to talk to her or look at her because I was afraid if I was capable of being a harm to her. I associate my dad with the hosptial and feeling anxious and scared and now when I think of watching a movie with him or talking to him in the same room my anxiety spikes and I need him to leave so I can calm down. Did I form a adversion to my family? Did I fuck up my brain to feel like I did while trying to get them to let me have my mom home? I'm so scared. I was looking through my old snapchats perviously and saw one with me and my sister and INSTANT panic attack just seeing her on the phone. What the hell is that? I remember my dad saying that when i'm feeling up to it he would take me out for a drive to feel better and I got anxious because now I associate being anxious with him. I can't get past this and it's draining. What does it mean? Am I going crazy? I need answers.",11Dec2017,1
1,"Over the past year, I have had worse and worse mood swings. One minute I’ll be normal and relaxed, the next minute I’ll be breaking things in a fit of anger or feel very suicidal. Everyday something either makes me super angry, and then after I go crazy I hate myself for doing stupid shit.
About a month ago,  I was with my friends hanging out. One of my friends is a big partier, and so he wanted us to come to a party with him. I didn’t want to go so I told him no, but he kept bugging me to go. For some reason I snapped and cussed him out infront of all my friends. I barely even remember what I said to him, it was like I was a different person. After that, he has slowly stopped talking or hanging out with me, we used to be best friends.
Little things like forgetting where I put my wallet make me go ballistic,  punching walls and smashing things. I don’t know why I do it, and I always feel stupid afterwards. Earlier today I smacked my hand against the wall, causing a huge bruise on my hand. This really scared me cuz I really could of broke my hand doing that.
What’s the best way to approach a therapist? Do I just say that I might have anger issues?",11Dec2017,3

8,"I am disconnected from reality. It feels as if this body is no longer mine and I am being controlled that outside forces. Everything I see, I do, I think, I feel, I know, I think I know are not real. They just appear to be so to make me into thinking that I am actually in control while I am in fact not. I now know it already, I am enlightened.

Everything is an illusion. Including me typing here. They are not real. They never happen. They are just there to make you into thinking that you are real. I still have my memory of what I did just now, yesterday, two days ago, one week ago, one year ago, ten years ago but I don't feel like I actually did them. It is only like they are purposely set up that way for this particular moment only. I know there are things called 'people' but I don't feel like they are real. They are just another set up by 'somebody' to build up all this illusion on me. 

I might be schizophrenic.
I did some research. I *think* I did some research. Even I believe that those things that I read, I see on the internet were purposely put there for me to read and to contribute to this illusion.
Although I don't have hallucinations like the major indicator of schizophrenia, which I think is what makes schizophrenics indeed schiziophrenics.

**TL;DR**
1. I believe that I am enlightened, to know that life is an illusion. All this time, it has been a lie, has always been.
3. I feel I'm the 'real' one, as in everything else is fake and not really there. They are there just to accommodate for this 'illusion'. But I am stuck here. Until 'whoever' up there is done playing with me and decides to let me go. I feel so lonely and scared.
4. I seem to only exist in this very instant only. I have memories of what happened in the past, but they don't feel like actually 'happened', but instead just another illusion made for this particular moment.

How do I get out of this? If there is 'life' as what this 'memory' presents, how do I get it back?! If there are things called 'schizophrenic', do 'you' people that don't actually exist think I am one of them??!

Please help... I don't know what to do.

EDIT: If 'you' think that this is DP/DR, not it's not. I've had them all along, but this time is different. With DP/DR, I knew that something was not right, but here I am convinced that this is the 'real' life.",11Dec2017,1
9,Im 30 years old male. My mom had a boyfriend who helped raise me for 10 years. They split over 10 years ago. He and I had no contact afterwards. Ive tried reaching out twice when i was very drunk with no response. Is it normal to still be thinking about this after so much time has passed?,11Dec2017,1
10,"I've been intimate with my boyfriend, but without sexual intercourse for 8 years now. We call each other when we're at work, text all the time, and spend all the time we can with each other. All of our interests are the same, and we're pretty much like best friends. Our relationship is pretty different than typical, but I've come to the realization that we should be having sex. 


I've always been uncomfortable when we are intimate, but he enjoys it so I've tried to tell myself that the more experience I get the easier it will be. I've talked to him before about how I feel...and I guess that's what has led to us not having sexual intercourse for so many years. I'm not certain, but I started realizing this could be the case. I don't know what is wrong with me and why I feel the way that I do when we're intimate. I feel like I'm in fight or flight mode. I bite my tongue and try to enjoy things, but even when he's touching me I feel like I'm going to cry. 


Despite this, I finally talked to him and told him that I wanted to have actual intercourse, because I think it would bring us closer. I've been afraid to because I am always uncomfortable with intimacy, but I've realized that it's something we should do as adults and it's silly we've been together this long without it.


So, we decided on this but haven't had intercourse, and then the first time last night, I didn't feel like I was in fight or flight mode. After so many years, finally I actually felt completely in the moment and felt closer to him than I've ever felt. I don't know what changed, maybe it was because we had a romantic getaway, I really don't get it. He asked me during it if I would use my mouth on him. I've been having trouble touching him normally, but I do it each time we're intimate and I wait until he places my hand on him before I start making him feel good. This is always difficult for me and I feel paniced but like everything else I try to steady my breathing and bite my tongue, and do it because I want to. For some reason when he asked me that question about using my mouth, I felt scared and it's just not something I want to do. I've been having trouble doing intimate things and I've been trying to get better, and I just do not want to do this. He knew I was hesitant and he said he didn't need it, and not to worry about it but I told him everything was fine and I could do this for him. I tried to start getting intimate again, and he told me then that I could touch him while we're being intimate on and off instead of waiting for him to take my hand and place it on him.


After he said that, my body went into full fight or flight mode. I told him I needed a drink of water and went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and hated myself. I covered myself up with a towel and didn't want to go out into the room again. I know I sound dramatic, but I really do hate myself so much. When I went back to him he told me he didn't need anything ""extra"" and that just having my fingers running through his hair, and my body close to his was all he needed, but I want to give him what he needs.


I tried to get online and figure out what was wrong with me and I guess maybe I have sexual aversion, but I've never had any sort of sexual abuse. I'm on depression medication, and I've seen two therapists this year that I couldn't afford to help me deal with my dad's unexpected death. None of my post has anything to do with my anxiety of my dad...I've always been like this in our relationship before he passed away. I really can't afford to see a therapist about this since I couldn't afford the two I saw this year either, are there any tips that I can talk to my boyfriend about this? I don't want to tell him that all these years I've had trouble being intimate because I know it will hurt him so bad that I lied, how do I talk about it now? Do I just bite my tongue and try a little at a time and hope things will not make me feel like this? Try and touch him more even though I feel like this? I mean I know I have to, so that he can feel pleasure but how can I make it not hurt so bad? Please any help about what I can do to not be like this or how I should talk to my boyfriend about what's wrong with me.

  **tl;dr**: I feel like I'm having a panic attack anytime that I'm intimate with my BF. I finally decided I wanted to have intercourse instead of only ""touching"", but before we could when he asked me to touch him more and use my mouth I feel like I can't do this anymore.

11,"I have really bad social anxiety and have become agoraphobic because of these annoying obsessive thoughts I have on my body image. I spend ages fixing my hair and to no avail. I make a real effort to look presentable if I have to go out. I wear clothes that I like and that I think flatter me somewhat, I do what I can about my hair. But in the end nothing I do makes me feel better. I would never do plastic surgery because I know it wouldn't make me feel better.

12,i am {name}{age} years old latley ive been feeling weird ive had bad thoughts. sometimes its as if someone/something is telling to kill myself or hurt my loved one i know they are bad thopughts and i am 100 % against them but they i dont know why they keep popping into my head. when i get them i get like a small headache on the top-back-left side of my head/brain. i know its just the devil trying too get me to do bad stuff . i think what is leading me to think of this is me being afraid and not being able to admit it. what scared me in the first place is that i really like memes so i would just go through a lot of memes on my free time when i was on instagram but occasionally the instagram algorithum would show someone getting killed or tortured but in a horrible way. But me being a teen i was like oof at first but as they continued to pop up i would just watch them and just not be affected by it but now they keep popping into my head i hate it it scares me it makes me feel sad and scareed and alone. i told my mom and shes been watching me closely because my mom wants to make sure im ok and not having any of these thoughts anymore but i dont know i dont like opening up to people there is no specific reason i dont like opening up but i just dont like it. i would likw to talk to someone but that i dont know like anonomously because atleast that way you wont know who i am.,11Dec2017,1

Like, I don't think this can be narrowed down to just, ""I should transfer to a different college"" or ""I should move to another town or state"". There's another life that I should be living, and the one I'm living now isn't it. I feel so disconnected from myself and my surroundings. For years, I've lived in my head most of the time, just letting the world around me whiz by in some sort of mostly-cohesive blur. But now either nothing feels quite real, or it all feels out of place.

Sometimes I get an idea of where I should be, but I can never get a complete image. It's all just atmosphere and sensation. When I'm in this sort of mood I tend to put on my headphones, turn up some music, and let it all wash over me.

I've been sleeping longer lately. My dreams have become more vivid, and when I'm in them, even if I don't understand them, I feel more connected to my surroundings and what's going on. There will be times during the day where I have to think about whether something I'm remembering happened in a dream or in real life. I want to spend more time living in these dreams.

The idea of becoming a hikikomori is more appealing to me than it used to be. I know that it's not healthy, but I can't help it.

I don't know what's going on. Maybe it's another effect of depression or anxiety. Maybe it's because I'm trans and stuck in the closet at home because I don't have enough money saved up to move out yet. Maybe it's something else entirely. I don't know.

33,"A few months back [I posted my thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/70iwsr/portraying_ed_in_film/) about writing a horror short film about a girl with an eating disorder. I got some amazing input from you kind people. I am still writing, and am now playing around with the idea of giving her an actual physical monster portraying her eating disorder.  

Do you ever think about your eating disorder in that way? If it was a person, a monster, or - as I call it - a stowaway: What would you guys do together? How would it act? Would it be nice, evil, flirty, manipulative, sweet, ugly?
What would it tell you?
What would it look like, and what would its super powers and weak spots be?
How would you be able to conquer it (and would you WANT to conquer it)?
If you did decide to conquer it, what do you think would have to happen for you to want to break free from it (what would be or has been your WORST point together with it)? 
Would it always be present, or would it visit you at certain times? If so, when?
Would it be invisible to other people? Would you try hiding it for other people?

I’d love to tell you a bit more about my monster if you’d be interested!

I'm 25 years old, am in good athletic shape but seem to have serious memory problems. This has been going on for 2 or so years but it has become more noticeable within this year. It's getting to the point where a person could tell me something and should they bring it up a couple of minutes later, I wouldn't be able to remember. Whether it be names, people or events, if it's not mentioned repeatedly or if I don't interact with them on a frequent basis, I almost always forget them.

I've begun taking notes of how my day goes and I've noticed a couple of things

Mind head is seemingly always fuzzy and my cognitive skills have slowed down (when I talk, I seem to ramble on without getting to the point).

Initially, I chalked it up to my previously heavy drug use and alcohol abuse (started drinking at 19, started drugs at 22) but I haven't had used in 18 months but now I'm not so sure.

It is maybe a matter of me not getting enough sleep , or stress, or repercussions of substance abuse or could I be looking at some sort of mental issue?",11Dec2017,2

44,"So about 2 months ago, with a couple of friends i went to smoke weed after not being smoking for close to 14 months. At first i didn't feel anything but a couple of seconds later i started feeling my heart beat insanely fast and everything started seeming very bad. I felt like i fainted and had woken up with a horrible feeling of overwhelming negativity and fear. My friends helped me and tried to relax me but i didn't really help me. After about an hour or two things started relaxing and i started feeling better. After sleeping the night that day the following day i was completely fine. I thought this panic attack i had was as a result of the weed i smoked which seems to happen sometimes to some people so i decided to not keep smoking. Now the thing that started bother is that as a result of having that panic attack, i realized the symptoms of a panic attack, the rushing heart, the feeling of losing control and etc. A couple of days ago i went to party and drank some alcohol and smoked half a cigarette, and yet again i started feeling like im going to have another panic attack, i started feeling my heart is beating faster and like im going to lose control but it the end after a couple of seconds the feeling went away. What worries my though is that maybe because i experienced a panic attack, i know understand the signs its going to happen, so each time i feel like my heart starts beating fast i immediately start thinking im going to have a panic attack. Im scared that maybe i actually have a panic attack disorder or have developed one, i sometimes think that when im driving, what if now i had a panic attack, what if i lose control in the middle of driving or walking in the street. This constant fear of losing control and being paralyzed by it worries me. I haven't told any family members of it mainly because that would mean i would tell them i smoked weed and also maybe they would sent me to a doctor to see if i have some sort of condition which could prohibit me from doing some things such as driving and such. I don't actually feel like im going to go completely nuts and have a full scale panic attack when i feel my heart, but my brain makes an immediate correlation that the day i had one. Could you guys tell me what you think? is this something serious i should talk or get help ASAP or let some more time pass?",11Dec2017,1

48,"Friend 2 stopped being friends with Friend 1 a few months ago due to the two of them having a toxic friendship and various other issues. After this, Friend 1 was in a really bad mental state and started self harming, skipping classes, becoming suicidal ETC 

She hasn’t been doing that lately because her best friend told her not to (and she’s pretty possessive over her bestie) but her hatred for Friend 2 has been growing and consuming her as time passed on. She completely blames Friend 2 for her decreasing mental state and refuses to take any responsibility for what she’s become.

Lately, Friend 1 has told me she has plans to make Friend 2 go through what he made her go through, and maybe a little extra. She doesn’t care what she has to do so long as he notices her again and realises the ‘mistake’  he made in leaving her.

I’m worried she might end up hurting him or herself in the process. Any ideas for how to deal with this?

(We’re in the UK, Friend 1 lives a couple hours away from us, we all go to different schools)

49,"I just sat in the still water of my tub for a good 20 minutes, and all I want to do is get back into bed full knowing I’ll be happier at work. I’m putting this all out there for two reasons:‬

‪1) Writing it out makes it a little better — it helps my mind process the feelings

‪2) I want others who also deal with this to get the same advice I came to: accepting (rather than trying to hide, or run, from it) and communicating it will hasten the recovery‬.

‪On the ever-growing list of my faults and weaknesses, this one is the worst because it cripples everything else in my life. Fuck damn, I wish I wasn’t built this way. I wish I wasn’t a blustering blow-hard. I wish I wasn’t this emotional and could fade into the background so I didn’t feel so fucking lonely. I wish I didn’t want to be alone so people couldn’t leave, and ultimately hurt, me. I wish I wasn’t aware of my pain. I wish I didn’t think so much. I wish I didn’t know how to share everything with people so I could more easily hide the things about myself I find frightening — ”a deserter hiding in a battlefield” if my “Magnificent Seven” is correct. I wish I wasn’t so desperate to connect with people. I wish I didn’t self-sabotage and put others in positions where I’m testing them — I’d rather you left me now rather than later when I’m emotionally involved. I wish I wasn’t so good at covering my frailties up by keeping myself moving — work, cycling, my Ravens group, etc. I wish this was the only time I’ve ever written a declaration similar to this.‬ I wish this is the last time I’ll ever write something like this — it won’t.

‪I breathe, eat, and sleep; but derive no joy from it. It’s a quiet, cold Hell; and for someone that’s fueled by passion, I feel like all I’m doing is participating in a functional death.‬

I am thankful however that I’ve made it through these epidodes before. I’m thankful I understand how to process and progress though these feelings. I’m thankful I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel this way. I’m thankful that I’ve learned to be brave as a result. I’m thankful it’s taught me how to really see who people  are— to know them for their being and not an accumulation of cultivated facts about them. I’ll be 34 in February, and I will have survived this for two decades by then — I’m thankful for that. I’m always thankful I’m not in my late teens or early 20’s any more. I’m thankful for my family and the family I’ve made away from my relatives. I’m thankful for how great my legs make me look when I’m naked — I killed it on the bike this year! I’m thankful that it’s taught me how to love and continue to try to love. I’m thankful it’s taught me to help others (because after feeling this way yourself, you’ll never want others to feel anything but happiness and love).‬ I’m thankful I’m still alive. I’m thankful I’ve never, and will never, do something I can’t come back from when feeling this way. I might not be thankful to be awake right now, but I am thankful to be alive. I’m thankful for the courage to write this despite my lack of courage to face the world today. I’m thankful if this helps someone other than myself. I’m thankful that writing this is helping me feel 1% better. I’m thankful that after I get through this episode, and am aware I’m past it, I’ll feel amazing. I’m thankful you read this.",11Dec2017,2

52,"I know you're probably pissed at me for asking that. After all, depressive disorders are a huge problem for a large part of the world's population. And not everyone gets to get better from it. So how would I have the guts to ask if getting rid of that problem is good? Of course it is, right?

I've been depressed and suicidal for a very, very long time. But recently, that all stopped. I thought I'd give just about anything to be genuinely happy for even just a second. But now I wonder.

The thing that knocked my suicidal thought processes out of the window was lolis. Yes. Childlike anime girls. Don't ask me how it works, but do tell me what's wrong with me. Because if being a lolicon cures your depression, something, somewhere in your brain, is thoroughly fucked up.

So now I'm no longer suicidal and looking at a simple picture of a loli gives me an instant morale boost and euphoria, but I have to explain everyone, including myself, that I'm not a weird paedophile. And I'm not sure for how long I can keep believing that.

To be honest they seem to me as tho they are all about the money or trying to get me on some drugs....

I first noticed this strange sensitivity when I experienced one of the worst things in my life.

I didn't fall asleep that day, and in the morning my legs and arms were numb-like, especially my left hand and right foot.

59,"So far my experience has been: 

A professor in college suggested I see the school therapist. We had one session and then they never responded to my e-mails and avoided me in the halls. 

A few years later I see another one. They explain to me that I seem to be a well rounded individual with my life in order and good coping strategies. 

A few months after that I find another one. They at least give a go at seriously helping me out. But I can’t get a word in and they talk my head in circles. And avoids heavy topics. 

Another few months... I find one who is willing to listen and tries. But, they literally read out of the DSM and asks me if points sound familiar. I feel like they might actually be good at what they specialize in. Just didn’t seem to have experience with my specific issues. 

Today I try Talkspace and my therapist hasn’t responded yet and it’s been over 3 hours. 

I’m functional, I hold down a job, and I am generally ok unless something happens that is out of my control. I’m from a low income very evangelical family and one of my therapist suggested my mom might have narcissistic personality disorder. She once stabbed me in the hand with a pencil for asking for help with my math homework. She told me she understood and emphasized with why that lady who drowned her 5 kids in the bathtub did what she did in the 90s. There are many other fucked up instances.  

I work in an industry where nearly all my coworkers seem to come from normal loving homes. So I kind of have to fake it to avoid people asking more questions or feeling sorry for me. 

I’ve never really gotten the chance to navigate all that old baggage. I am generally fine and well adjusted. I can rally when I need to. I do have periods where I fantasize about dying. Those periods don’t always last very long.  But, I am afraid if too many hit in too short of time there will be one day I can’t snap out of it. Not being able to find a fitting therapist has really hit me pretty hard today.

Further... she's telling me to apply for a phd at UofT (a top tier university). I went to Ryerson (an average university) and got a cheap ass M.Eng degree after my B.Eng. The M.Eng is not worth much.

66,"TL:DR at the end

So I am a 30 year old male.  I have been living with my wife for 8 years now and we have a very happy, healthy family with two (soon to be 3) fur babies that we treat as if we gave birth to them.  Growing up I had several mental health issues that I did not get treatment for until 2014 and since then my life has fully changed for the better.  I still have issues in some areas of my life but I've come a long way.  (if you want to know more about my treatment/past, just ask)

So my issue today surrounds my mother.  My mother's mother passed away in 2000 which was her breaking point.  She has never been the same since.  While my parents were together we took her to a couple different psychiatrists and each time we went she would act completely normal and make my father and I look like the crazy ones.  Both doctors did not want to press the issue even though we explained exactly what is going on with her and that she clearly has many traits of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia.  Nothing was done.

After years of living with her illness and her only acting out when around my father and I, he took a transfer and started the divorce process.  The state said that given my age I could choose who to move with, and I chose to move with my dad.  The divorce went through, the house was sold, and my dad and I moved a couple hundred miles away.  

Fast forward a year.  She wanted me to fly up to visit her for Christmas.  I did and it was scheduled to be there from December 23rd until January 2nd.  On Christmas Eve she had an episode and literally kicked her 15 year old son out in the middle of a snow storm.  I walked two miles to a bus station and had to wait to take a Greyhound on a 24 hour long bus ride back to Georgia on Christmas Day.  

I refused to answer any of her calls or texts for 5 years until my dad started talking to her again.  She seemed fine, but I started talking to her again.  At one point she wanted to send me some stuff for Christmas and I gave her my address, which wasn't a big deal.  She would have her episodes on the phone and talk about the people that break into her house and steal the TV remote, re-arrange stuff, steam random stuff but not take the actually valuable stuff.  People are constantly breaking into her house and ""stealing"" from her.  I would always tell her that she needs to go and speak to a doctor about that and she always blows me off as if I need help.  

She has burnt every single bridge with family members other than one of her sisters.  EVERYONE else has gone on with their life and will not deal with her.  She has trespass orders against her with two family members.

So after years of staying away from her she lands a stable job working as a cleaner at a hospital.  She makes decent money and actually closed on a house earlier this year.  I told her about my upcoming marriage (July of this year) and that I would like it if she could come.  Things did not work out and she could not make it, but I sent her some pictures from our very simple backyard ceremony.  Her replies?  

""That's not my son.""  ""He wouldn't marry a fat girl like that.""  

Up until that point I had never felt the urge to punch someone so hard in my entire life.  Nothing she had said before had got me that angry, and I made it clear that if she wants to remain a part of my life that she better damn well respect my wife and our relationship.  She has not insulted my wife since.  

So in September she wanted to come down to visit sometime in October.  I told her no, mostly because her car is a total piece of shit and I don't expect it to last the rest of the year, let alone the 10 hour drive.  She postpones it until December.  

A week ago after seeing her outbursts through texts and with my wife noticing signs of me stressing out a lot faster than normal, we talked it out and decided that maybe it would be best that my mom not come down.  So I texted her, in short, that ""I'm sorry to wait until this soon, but I really don't want you to come down without you going to a doctor and getting on medication beforehand.""  She didn't like that and disregarded my feelings and said that she was coming down anyway.  I told her that I am not interested in her coming down and that she will waste her time and money coming down because I have to look out for my own mental health first and foremost.  

This past Saturday she texted me stating that she got her rental car.  I immediately told her to return it and that I am not going to meet with her if she drives down.  She says that everything is already paid for and that she is coming down anyway.  At this point my wife and I go to our local police.  

I work with the police (tow truck driver) so I know a few officers on a first name basis.  The officer who took my report was one that I have known for nearly a decade and we both agreed that no laws have been broken yet, I stated that if she comes to my door I will not open it and tell her multiple times that she needs to leave before I call the police.  If she doesn't leave, I call.  

So Sunday she actually drives down.  I texted her multiple times throughout the day telling her that I am not interested in meeting with her in her current state and that she is wasting her time.  My wife and I are on high alert right now until we confirm that she leaves.  

Today she came by my house while my wife and I were at work.  I texted her to not come onto my property again until she sees a professional.  

I haven't heard from her since.  I know she is still in town.  

I contacted my aunt for the first time in nearly a decade, she's making me out to be the bad guy.  My father initially sided with her until I reminded him that it's easy for him to have that mentality when he doesn't talk to her nor does she know where he lives.  (He has since remarried)

TL:DR My mom is undiagnosed, untreated and non-violent, but I do not want her near me at all unless she seeks professional help.  She just drove 10 hours to visit me after I told her for a week to cancel the trip.  I do not and will not meet with her.  Is it wrong of me to want her to get the same help I got?  Is it wrong of me to think about my health first before allowing someone into my life that causes me nothing but negative feelings simply because she is my mother?  I want to get her some help but she will not go willingly and since she is not a danger to herself or others I cannot compel her to go into treatment.   At this point if she does not willingly go to treatment I just want to cut all ties with her and move on with my life, because when we have kids I will not expose them to her unless she is under the care of a professional.",11Dec2017,3
