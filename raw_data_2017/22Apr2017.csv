2,"Hi there, I'm an 18 year old male currently in my final year of high school in the UK studying A-Levels (for anyone in America i think thats the equivalent to APs, unsure) which usually last two years, but due to my then-declining mental health, I had to resit the first year of A Levels to pull my grades up to withstand an opportunity to get into university (or college.) I now have a very realistic change of getting into University to study my chosen subject next year now, but I feel certain that my grades will dwindle this year.

I face a difficult time with depression and anxiety. I feel as if it cripples me and even if I do the simplest of activities during the week, I feel exhausted. Sometimes I would get an elated mood, but it would never last any longer than a few hours. During the week I attend school and have a part time job in Retail at the weekends, working a Friday night and Sunday. I find the job rather stressful, and it is unusual for me to come out of the job with a smile on my face at all. 

From whenever I was approximately 13 years old, I remember being normal and then whenever puberty hit me like a train, I began feeling down. I thought this was normal up until early 2015, whenever my Grandmother died to whomst I was very close to, as she lived with me and my Father in her final 3 years of life )I started realising that something wasn't right and my then-year head in school recognised that there was something up and referred me on to see the school counsellor. Whenever I went to the counsellor, which I got on amazing with, I recognised that I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and the thought of probably depression seriously upset me. I don't know why, but all I done was pre-occupied myself by entertaining myself with friends. I now would consider myself a distant person from everyone, feeling as if everyone considers me odd or rare. I don't know why, maybe it's the anxiety or because I would have a hugely outgoing personality anyway. 

When my Grandmother died, I was in a relationship with a girl who frequently mistreated me and often broke off the relationship as she ""never felt old enough to be in a serious relationship."" At the time, this used to break my heart, but looking back, I should've went when I could. In June of that same year, I had discovered for a month or so before we broke up, she had been seeing one of my best friends behind my back. This time, I delved into alcohol to suppress my feelings at the time to ensure that I could've numbed out the pain. After about 2 months of solid drinking, I realised that it was stupid drinking to the extent of which I was and that there was a bigger life out there than what I was currently experiencing.

My parents and I have a not-so-perfect relationship. My Mother, is a lovely lady and I stay with her 3 or 4 times a week and the other half with my Father, whose health is failing rather rapidly due to suspected cancer (which he is currently getting tested for) and COPD. When I was younger, my Father and I didn't have the best of relationships, leaving my Mother with me whenever I was 2 and my Mother stopped me from seeing him until I was 6 or 7. I feel as if this impacted me greatly in my development as a young man.

Fast forward to 2016. The worst year of my life. I had entered a new relationship with a girl who had BPD and had often attenpted suicide, sometimes coming very close. In the time of our relationship, we had some good times but our lack of strength sometimes showed and all we basically done was lay in the house most days. I still had my friends, but she had nobody only me. I had taken on a lot in that relationship and it definitely had an impact dealing with the stresses of her daily life to ensure she made it through okay whilst in my company as it pained me to see her. In August, after we finished due to an argument, she had fallen pregnant and after a week or so of being upset due to my future, which I had planned to carry on for the benefit of the child, was in ruins. However, we had found out that she had lost the child after 11 weeks which seriously upset me. This broke my heart and left me in bed crying on my own for 3 days, with no-one near me. And subsequently left my ex-girlfriend in a mental hospital for 3 weeks.

After this relationship had broken down, I had began to dabble with smoking pot and taking ecstasy tablets (always used pillreport) and felt like I was okay. After a month or two of using ecstasy 4 or 5 times, I had told myself I needed to stop for the sake of my mental health, and my studies. I still continue to use pot, but only at night after 9PM. I haven't smoked pot in a week and a half though and don't feel any need to use, and I wouldn't call myself an addict.

As for ecstasy use, I haven't used ecstasy since mid-February and before that, just before Christmas. I had a huge break from it as I had got rejected from a nightclub whilst using ecstasy and realising how it wrecks me and I know now that ecstasy is not a drug to use on a night out as it makes you look, and act, like a fool. In mid-February I took it with a friend who wanted to try and I, along with a friend who was sober, ensured that we were safely taking it and that if any warning signs show up, we can be safe on it and we can get required help.

I met my new girlfriend and I have to say she is the most supportive out of the 3 that I have met. She is so amazing although she doesn't understand the pain I'm going through mentally. I feel most days that life is no longer worth living and that there is nothing further to look forward to and I'm worried that this will cause the end of our relationship, as I really love this girl and her personality and everything about her to a serious extent and never regret meeting her. I feel as if she's scared to leave me also in the case of suicide, however this is something I have never discussed with her in the slightest.

Currently at the moment, I experience suicidal thoughts very frequently. I currently see a Psychiatrist about this but I feel as if getting everything out on the surface makes it hurt a lot more and I'm really scared to ever be alone and indepedent in the world because I may commit suicide. I feel as if I have no purpose and that I am a shadow of my former self with lots of mental health issues which I feel is a huge issue to discuss with others as it causes me great pain. I live in a rural area and the many people that talk to mental health professionals is much greater than what it previously was, but this has put me off wanting to talk for some reason, but I don't know why. I feel some days like shutting off from society and managing an entire week of school is near impossible at this rate. I face a hugely difficult task of getting out of bed in the morning to face the real world which will probably hit me in the face someday whilst I'm on my own. I don't like the thought of suicide one bit but I really don't feel as if talking helps one bit, but worsens the situation. I can't even remember the last time I was happy and it pains me to even think of happy times when I was younger as I realised that life as I knew it around 9 or 10 was the best I'll probably ever have, although it didn't even seem that good.

I don't know what to think of all of this or to what benefit this will provide posting it on the internet, but I'd like to get active and see how talking about this anonymously will help. I really don't have a clue what to expect on Reddit as this is my first time using it.

Ask away folks, please don't be afraid to comment on my situation. It is appreciated. ",22Apr2017,2
3,"I've heard of classic borderline before but I didn't have a very good understanding of it. Last night I watched a YouTube video of a mental health specialist going over the differences between classic and quiet BPD. Well I'm pretty sure I'm a quiet borderline. All of the symptoms for quiet BPD matched me to some degree. If I was, it would explain a lot. It would explain why I've never had a healthy romantic relationship. It would explain why I've always had trouble letting go of relationships that were clearly unhealthy. It would also explain why I have trouble keeping and making friends, and why I feel awkward getting close with people outside of a romantic setting. It would also explain the anxiety and depression I've experienced as a result of these issues.

But where do I go from here? Can this be treated? Would it be reasonable to go to a therapist and tell them that I think this is what's wrong with me? I don't even know if I'm ready to talk about this with anyone, but if there's some form of treatment then I would be open to it. ",22Apr2017,2
4,"So to start, I work in a local Chinese restaurant, and we have grease traps there that are cleaned once a week, and if we clean them, it's either 5-15 dollars depending on which one we do. Lately, I've been trying to make a bit extra cash, so I took the offer to do it tonight Halfway through I got really really nauseous, and by the end I was dizzy and on the verge of tears. I left work tonight crying to my boyfriend because I felt so depersonalized and sad and I couldn't calm down. I puked, too, which was mainly bile as I hadn't eaten since noon. I'm not able to stomach more than nibbles of saltines and chamomile tea. I just don't know what caused this. I am diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but I do not know if this correlates.

5,"Sometimes I feel like I can be deceitful to myself, like my ""mind A"" is determined to make me believe that I'm a terrible person not worthy of love and relationships/friendships or happiness of any sort, and my ""mind B"" knows I'm a good person and is struggling to work through whatever mental issue(s) I have, but ""mind A"" tries to confuse me about what symptoms I have so that I can't reach a diagnosis and get better. Is this normal? If not what could be wrong with me? Is this something that could get me sent to a psychiatric hospital? I want help, but I don't want to say something crazy and end up institutionalized. ",22Apr2017,1

9,"Today, for about two hours, I felt extremely strange. All words and sounds sounded very different to me, and everything around me seemed incredibly important. I don't know quite how to describe it, but there was a strange physical aspect to it as well. I used to experience this for a few minutes at a time as a kid, but today it was for hours. I know one other person who has described something similar. I'm wondering what this is. Also, I'm wondering what the word is for perceiving importance that isn't there. I'm sorry if none of this makes sense. Any help would be appreciated.

Edit 1: I'm fairly certain I've read about a technical term for the psychological phenomenon of perceiving incredible importance in everyday things, I just cannot for the life of me find it again. That's why I'm asking about the name.

13,"I have no idea what is wrong with me, I'm not feeling like me anymore. I've suffered from anxiety and depression for a few years and felt fairly well controlled. I was in therapy until I lost my insurance last July. I still felt like I was doing really well, but the last couple of months I have started to decline. This is much more than just anxiety and depression. I have huge outbursts of anger, I cry more than I ever have, I'll feel super in control and getting stuff done and then suddenly I've collapsed into a state of despair. 
I have accumulated a lot of big stresses and I know that that must have something to do with it. But I'm really up and down and all over the place and I'm picking fights with my s.o. because even though it is unintentionally he makes me feel worse about myself. I'm always apologizing for my feelings and I hate that I do it, but fear if I don't he'll boot me to the curb and I have no where to go. I went to the college counselor but 1 I don't like her and 2 she seems to just say motivational poster garbage that isn't really helpful. 
I've been suicidal for the last two months. Today I just wanted to hurt myself. I've noticed I'm starting to itch all the time especially on my face. I don't drink or use drugs, I have other health problems but because no insurance the only one I've been able to keep up on is my type 1 diabetes. I think I might be bi polar. But I'm not sure. All I know is that I hate this person I'm watching turn into an emotionally uncontrollable self destructive human being. I am trying to take the steps to get insurance again and remedy some of the stressors but I don't know if I can keep holding on while I'm waiting for the red tape. I feel so lost and broken.

So far I took them once during the morning and got nauseous (common) and had a strange panic attack (not like usual), and during the night last time as I'm scared of those side effects again. Will this ruin the effect through out the day if I keep taking them during the evening?

15,"So I have a few friends. I'll hang with them sometimes, but I really don't like to for more than an hour at a time. I'm not one of those people who is always with their friends. I love being around my boyfriend. We don't do much, he'll be on his computer and I'll be on the bed studying. Not much talking, and it's great. But when my friend calls me (I hate talking on the phone) and says she's about to come over to chill for the rest of the evening, I freak out. 

I like her, I just can't handle being with people without previous planning. She likes to hang out late and I want to scream and kick her out. (I don't ofc) when I'm in my boyfriends home town, we'll have hang outs all night with our other friends, but we always plan these out in advance so I'm cool with it, plus I'm around him and one of my closest friends who lives away from me.

Anyway, I basically only want to be around him. Dad always telling me to make friends when I don't want any, I feel like I have too many as is.",23Apr2017,5

18,"I am an almost 19 year old pale skin Latina, dark curly hair and dark eyes, petite and curvy. I am recovering from a breakup from a very serious relationship, my ex is a 20 year old white male with dark hair and pale blue eyes, fair skin. I do not know if he does it maliciously on purpose, but he will often talk about his new sex life, describe these girls in a lustful tone, etc. I don't know if it's to make me jealous, but it has not done that. More its made me extremely extremely hurt and insecure. 

Late at night I scrolled through my exs comment history on Reddit (he's a popular redditor I guess?) and I came across some alarming content. I don't know, but I discovered some truths. For example, he told me I was exactly his type when we first started dating, whereas I found out his type is actually blonde, thin and fit, Caucasian girls. (I do not fit in this category, obviously). My parents are physically and emotionally abusive and one of the things my mom constantly tells me since a young age is that I'm too fat, she was more beautiful and skinnier than me when she was my age, I have more native looking features (I look very Eurocentric in my opinion, but not enough to satisfy my mother. She's colorist if you couldn't tell). In high school the pressure to look more Eurocentric resulted in me spending hundreds of dollars in buying realistic blue colored contacts. 


I know every woman of color has gone through the insecurities of not feeling beautiful enough because they do not see themselves represented in media, I know I have. But I feel like this obsession to look more ""white"" has returned after I started embracing my ethnic features. I used to use lightening products in middle school, had highlights, sunscreen everyday so I wouldn't tan. The point being, I have developed this silly sick image that my then boyfriend lost interest in me (attraction wise, I fucked up as a gf) because I didn't look ""white enough""? Blonde, skinny and fit, light eyes. This unhealthy obsession has gotten to the point I scheduled a hair appointment to dye my hair blonde, and I am starting to restrict food portions / eat less to be skinnier. 


Maybe it was once the fact he once dissed how I looked like and from that moment on I feel so insecure. I look in the mirror, and my 115 pound ass, and I see myself like a whale? Like super overweight?? I am hungry all the time, i feel like this unhealthy obsession is going to turn into a body disorder, idk. I can't force myself to puke because nothing comes out. I will definitely talk to my therapist about it, but is this just stupid insecurities or am i noticing warning signs? It's making me physically and mentally  sick. ",23Apr2017,2

21,"I'm a 19m and have had trouble with my mental health for a few years now, most noticeably in the past year, though overall this has been the best 12 months of my life. My social life at university has been far better than before and I have an extremely healthy relationship with my girlfriend of just over a year and a half.
I have told my girlfriend and three of my closest friends about a period 5/6 years ago when bullying almost led to me wanting to kill myself, though only my girlfriend knows of how I've felt on and off this past year.
I've felt for a while that perhaps I have some kind of mental health problem but feel I'm in a dilemma. I feel if I am diagnosed with something that I'm weak and an attention seeker in society's eyes but if I don't then I feel like I'd be denying myself something I may desperately need sometime.

22,"Ok, here it goes...

When I bake, I have a personal tradition of eating at least something of what I make. Some months ago, I made cookies, but when I make cookies I taste them first when they are hot, and then again after they cooled down.

This particular batch, I only tasted after they are hot. Now, many months later, I keep trying to ""make up"" for them... I skip eating some of the things I make the day after they are made, or I try to have a small bite and let someone else finish them. Sometimes  I skip the food someone else makes altogether, to ""equate"" what I did with those cookies. But it never feels right and the thoughts just HAUNT me the entire day of how I can make things right.

I have some sort of obsession with symmetry or things being ""equal"", e.g If I bump my left elbow on something, I will bump the same object with my right elbow. If I started the day with an apple, I will likely end it with one. If I'm in a particular mood in the morning, I try to replicate it in the evening. I feel like the food issue is somehow linked to this.

Also, if I wait for someone to finish food and they don't, for example if the cake just stays in the fridge for days on end, I just binge on it and finish everything so it doesn't ""tempt"" me in the morning. I would do this regardless of whether I'm hungry or not. Then I feel guilty and just carry on eating because ""I ruined everything already, so might as well"". Or I fast for a long time, to somehow ""make up for it"".

These are just some of the things I can think of now off the top of my head. The cookie thing has been torturing me today because I made a cake yesterday and the whole day was trying to decide whether to just leave it or have some, or eat everything (spoiler: I had some, but it's not a ""cookie"" so it doesn't feel right. But I feel like it won't be right even if I try to replicate the cookies, because they are not going to be 100% the same as on *that* day).

For reference I'm Male, 19.

27,"This is a re-post from ask reddit. 
TL;DR at the end.

I've recently been diagnosed with Schizoid Personality Disorder and since I was given the diagnosis everything has finally made sense. Up until then I'd been diagnosed with manic depression and had been put on many different medications and nothing worked.

Here are the symptoms I've experienced/deal with on a daily basis:
1) I find no joy or pleasure in any sort of hobby whether it be writing, playing video games, talking to people close to me, or anything in general that could be considered an activity to derive fun or happiness from.

2) I have never had motivation to do anything and I've been this way for as long as I can remember. I do not feel pride when I am praised, and I do not feel upset when I am criticized. 

3) I have never felt close to anyone, even my own blood relatives. I've never felt comfort from a hug or anything like that from someone that I am close to or have known for a long time. I mean, even when my mom hugs/hugged me when something bad happens or even as a greeting I generally feel nothing.

4) I have a pretty black and white view on life as far as morals and ethics go. This combined with the fact I've never felt close to anyone has made it really easy to end friendships that are sometimes over a decade long. I feel no remorse when cutting someone out of my life—even if it’s over what someone else would consider small.

5) I have never really felt the 'appropriate' emotion for certain life events. The only time I really really felt sad was when my grandpa died. He was the only person, I suppose, I've ever felt close to at all.

6) I'm obsessive over anything I'm working on at the time being perfect. I also obsess and over analyze every social interaction I have with other people as well as what other people say or do to me.

7) Until I was fifteen I had a hard time with making eye contact with someone I'd be talking with at the time.

8) I tend to live in my head—I write a lot and most of it is fiction/fantasy based on entire worlds, with their own rules and mythos that I've created in my head.

9) My husband along with a few other 'close friends' have told me that I appear as if I don't care at all (I do care, but only about a select few people, mainly just my husband). They've also said they find it difficult to tell when I'm joking or being serious.

10) I have an almost non-existent sex drive.

I have been in 'talk therapy' on and off for ten years. It's only just now that I've been given the 'correct' diagnosis. I have been on many different antidepressants (at least I've been on/tried all of the popular ones). I just want to find life enjoyable at times like normal people, I mean it doesn't even have to be the majority of the time—I’d settle for enjoying like 30% of the time or even 20% as long as I could feel happiness, joy, and pleasure during those times. Hell, it'd even be refreshing to feel miserable and be able to compare it to when I felt good/great.

TL;DR – Find no enjoyment in anything ever. Don’t feel close to anyone at all except for my husband (even my own parents feel foreign to me). I have never had motivation—at least I’ve never felt motivation for as long as I can remember. I don’t like hugs or affection from anyone except for on occasion from my husband. I have a strict black and white view on the world and my personal relationships. I’ve been in ‘talk therapy’ for ten years and it’s only recently that my diagnosis was changed from manic depressive, OCD, and ADHD to Schizoid Personality Disorder (and when I studied the topic everything suddenly ‘clicked’ as far as explaining my life and the things going on within it). Do any of you recommend a medication that has had decent success in treating this disorder?

32,"I just wanted to throw this story out there. I understand it's a one-time experience with a particular hotline in my city, but i just wanted to share in case others had a similar experience and what to really do about it.
I reached out to the suicide hotline not exactly with a plan to commit suicide, but with the thoughts of ""I just want to give up,"" ""I wish I would die"", but also ""I don't know if I could go through with hurting myself, but I am an extremely low point that I wouldn't care if I somehow ended up dead."" And yes, perhaps I could've found a different source, but I've tried that ""Cups of Tea"" website where it's supposed to be online counseling and I've never gotten to talk to anyone on there, instead been on hold for hours.
So I called this hotline and I was in tears. The lady who picked up at the other end let it be clear that she was tired, and frankly a little peeved that I was calling and didn't really have suicidal actions. I told her my thought process, how I'd been dealing with depression, how I was losing motivation to do anything in life. She just sighed repeatedly (an annoyed sigh, not a pitiful one. I know the difference.) She kept saying I just needed to come down to this local health center in our city, and talk to a professional there. I was shocked. I felt as if I was talking to a robot who couldn't comprehend that I was upset. I'm not exaggerating when I say the tone of her voice sounded like a bored receptionist. She even went on to ask why I had called if I didn't want to kill myself. I tried to explain as best that I could that I was wishing to be dead, but I couldn't exactly picture myself carrying it out that far. She sighed for about the twentieth time and repeated again that I should just go down to the health center and there I'd be committed for three days. Yes, ""committed."" 
I finally just said, you know what, I think I'm done. I told her this hadn't been helpful at all and if anything made me feel just what I'd feared--that I was a burden for talking about my feelings. She said she could transfer me to a domestic violence hotline. I was again shocked. I hadn't even mentioned a single thing about domestic violence or abuse. I had spoken about my boyfriend and how I felt like he wasn't being understanding of my mental health. But that was it. I almost laughed and told her that wasn't necessary and then  said to her that I hoped (I'd gotten heated at this point) the next person who spoke to her wouldn't off themselves because she was so rude and helpful. I hung up.
Now...I realize what most likely happened was she was super exhausted, maybe over worked. Maybe not even qualified. But to sit there on the phone with anyone in a crisis like that and act like they're boring you to death or that you're just ""Not suicidal enough"" was so ridiculous to me. It took me so much courage to even pick up the phone and what I got was that. 
Anyone else had something like this happen or did I just pick the worst hotline to call?    ",23Apr2017,11

35,"Hey all.

I have been dating a girl for about 3 months now and things have not been going well lately. I've felt like she doesn't feel the same way about me as she used to and she doesn't really make me feel loved or cared about much anymore. We've had multiple talks about this and almost broken up multiple times, and she has always blamed the way she's behaving on something like a shitty job, her relationship with her dad, long days at work, etc. I have been doing everything I can to make her happy and feel loved, but I don't get the same in return. Every time that we've almost broken up (probably about 3 times now) I've told her in order for me to stay in this relationship I need her to show me she cares about me and loves me. She always says she will but then doesn't really follow through or change anything.

Well, after 2 weeks of feeling like she was ignoring me, I told her last night that I was officially done and didn't want to talk about it this time. I had texted her this (please don't criticize me for texting it to her, all the other times were in person and it definitely felt justified this time) and then 20 minutes later she showed up at my house. She told me she had been lying to me and herself and that she was depressed and didn't know what to do about it.

Here's the tough part...I had no idea about this and I have been through a similar situation myself. I was able to pull myself out of it by finding a sense of spirituality and utilizing meditation, visualization, gratitude, affirmations, mindfulness and a list of other things that fall more on the ""hocus pocus"" side of things (Reiki, tarot, etc.). All of these things had a huge impact on my life and I have talked to her about them before but she seemed to kind of brush them off.

Well, after she told me she was depressed I immediately wanted to help, because I see myself as a ""healer"" and I really care about her. After giving her a long hug and trying to think of what to say or do about the situation, I decided to tell her that the only condition I would stay was if she was willing to try some of the techniques and exercises that I've found to really help me. I told her that I think I can help her out of this and that I want to see her get better.

She told me that she didn't want to be a burden on me and that she didn't want me to sacrifice my happiness to try and make her feel better. I told her that if she would try the stuff I suggested that it would make me happy, and seeing her get better would make me extremely happy.

Now I'm having second thoughts...I did some research into how to help people with depression and I just don't know what to do because I think it really could continue to affect my happiness as it has been up to this point. At the same time, I don't want to just abandon her and tell her that I hope she gets better but I can't help her and can't keep talking to her. Do I tell her I'm always here for her but just as a friend? Do I stay in the relationship and then just bail if she continues to treat me poorly? I feel like if I break up with her it will just make things worse and I don't want her to hurt any more than she already is. I'm very torn and could really use some advice.",23Apr2017,2

39,"I suffered a lot of emotional abuse from my parents, and they constantly fought, but never had any physical or sexual abuse.

Yet here I am, depressed as hell and have seriously considered / planned suicide to relieve everyone else of the pain and disappointment I continue to provide those around me.

Does anyone else feel this way? I literally feel guilty for being depressed because I feel like I don't have valid enough reasons for being depressed.",23Apr2017,2

41,"I am very dependent on my therapist. When i told her I feel as though my life is going to shit and that I won't cope when therapy ends she told me that she'll keep in touch after therapy.

Her words were:
""You'll at least have me"" and ""I won't abandon you""

Fair enough I was happy, but i feel as though she is encouraging a dependency. I feel we are very close, but surely she's meant to be weaning me off of her support rather than enforcing a dependency when I've almost ended my therapy. What are you thoughts?",23Apr2017,1

44,"So the last 5 months, I spent a total of 72 days in a mental hospital in 3 stays. The last time I went, which I got discharged from on Friday, I left the same way I entered: suicidal. I am on the verge of self harming and keep putting myself into situations that are apart of my suicide plans. The  treatment they set me up with is a psychiatrist, no counseling, no outpatient, or any of that. I'm planning to talk to my guidance counselor tomorrow at school to see if she can help me know what resources I have in the area. The obvious goal is to not end my life but my suicidal ideations are strong, stronger than ever. I keep reaching out for help and unable to get what I am looking for. What have you guys done after being discharged from inpatient? All the research I've done says call 911 and go to the emergency room if you are experiencing suicidal thoughts but I did, and it's not working. I went to the same behavioral hospital 3 times maybe switch up? I don't know. But I do know that reddit isn't going to solve my problems, but I know a lot of people here have gone through the same thing that I am going through right now. Thank you.",23Apr2017,1

47,"I'm sitting here crying - M(44) - for the first time in a long time.

I feel so alone.

Yesterday my daughter (24) who co-owns the house and lives with me decided that she was leaving.
While I was gone to the store she took her cat and left.
I didn't know this was happening and we hadn't talked about it.

She said she didn't feel safe and that I was violent and emotionally abusive.

I admit I have my issues and we have gotten in huge arguments before. We've pushed and shoved but never hit each other.

I suffer from depression and stress related anxiety.
She is bipolar.

She has blocked me from Facebook and won't talk to me at all. I found out from a mutual friend that she is lighting the match and tossing it over her shoulder. 

Apparently she will have lawyers contact me to figure out what to do about the house.

I'm all alone. 
I've never really been alone.
I want my daughter back even if she doesn't live here.

I want to find funny things on Reddit and share them with her
I want to tell her I love her.

My ex wife committed suicide and I saw what that did to my daughter, but I'm really thinking about it as being the thing to do to take care of her.
If I'm gone then she gets my life insurance and I don't have to be alone anymore.

Not asking for help.
Potentially want a painless way to die.
Hope it wouldn't fuck her up too much more.

I'm so alone.
I have friends, they talk to me, but it isn't the same.
I've had my kid for the past 24 years, and 17 pf that I had her mom (until she divorced me).
This feels like the divorce all over again. 

I haven't dated, don't have the money, want to do my hobbies and shit, but don't want to be alone.

I'm so lonely.

I just want to tell her I love her.",23Apr2017,2

49,"Let me start by saying I had a great childhood, great family, always sociable. In my teens things were good I was with the ""cool kids"" at school, I had women attracted to me everything was great. My grades weren't the best when I got older but I'd take that life over mine now any day.

My problems only got triggered a few years after school although I can't remember the exact sequence of events. It went something like this; I planned an event with a friends and some of his friends. I paid for it in advanced but I never actually got to asking them for the money when it happened. I was 19 and it was about £800, in hindsight I could have gotten over it. At the time of the event I was in the process of getting my first girlfriend. I was doing very well in wooing her. Made her chuckle so much with cocky funny humour that I learnt to do for example. I'm not capable of that anymore though. Anyway when I gave away that money I felt a huge sinking feeling in my stomach like I was devastated I started linking losing the money to losing that girl aswell. I took a holiday to try and perk myself up again. It didn't work and when i got back i started acting oddly saying strange things and to that girl which scared her off. Talking gibberish gradually turnwd into me becoming a mute pretty much for around 6 months. After which I gradually started talking a bit more. I dont feel like I ever got my true personality back though. I feel comfortable talking but its like I'm a different person. A bit of a shy weird socially awkward person. It's hard to explain. I dont really know if this is a mental health thing in itself but I have seemed to be getting the weird episodes of saying strange things and acting a bit wild and often violent. As a result I've been recently diagnosed with bipolar. This might be true but I still feel conned because my personality has gone pretty much compared to 7 years ago. I feel so insecure and I always beat myself up or put myself down practically every day. I cant understand how something so small caused all this. The girl was a part of it but losing the money definitely played a part. Causes of bipolar usually dont involve small distressing events like this but rather traumatic things do. So is this normal? I hate how something so silly in hindsight has practically tucked up my life. Also what disorders can seriously effect your personality? Because I feel like this is what hurts the most",23Apr2017,2

52,"I have depersonalization and I'm working through all that very well, I just have no idea what I want to do or who I am. Regardless of that my happiness is rising.

I love being creative, I love making music and writing. My issue though is I have no idea what music I want to make, I have no idea what I want to write about, I have no idea what I want to tell the world.

I have my own opinions, i am not boring, i just don't feel the need to share it with anyone, and even when I do.. I dunno, I just don't have any edge to me. I'm a faceless cog, and I don't just mean in the corporate sense.

I wear plain dark clothes and I am quiet. I think this is because I had a few reallllllly shitty years and had a whole ""don't acknowledge my existence"" phase, but I'm over that and I'm not sure who I am or what I have to say.

I don't know where to begin in looking for a job, deciding what kind of a person I am. I have sooo many different aspects to me that I love. I can be evil, I can be kind, caring, generous, condescending, whatever. I love the balance I have of that but I feel like a website with no UI.",23Apr2017,4
