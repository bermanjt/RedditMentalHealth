3,It helped a bit but they weren't able to treat me at all due to the fact of me not having a serious mental illness. But after i explained my situation and what got me there it just didn't help. I came home today angrier than i had been in months almost 2 years. Why can't i just stop feeling like this.,25Jan2017,3

5,"sorry if that title makes no sense, i cant figure out how to word it. currently i have 4 diagnosis's that i take medication for and am/have recieved help for:

major depressive disorder- currently on 40mg lexapro, used to take zoloft and been in and out of therapy for ~10 years, currently not in therapy 

generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder: lexapro is mostly for this after my psychitrists decided anxiety was the main problem and not depression, which i don't agree with at all but whatever

adhd: take 30 mg adderall

im starting to think ive got a lot more than just these but im scared to actually go to try and get help again. i barely scratch the surface of my problems with my therapists because when i open up i just get sent to the psych ward for a few months and i hate it and it makes me want to die even more so thats why im on reddit i guess. anyway like i said i think i have a lot more problems than they think i have, ill try my best to explain what i think i have and why, and i appreciate any opinions. please know im trying my best to tell the truth and explain things from how they are in my mind, which is always really jumbled and never makes sense so sorry if you can't understand

borderline personality disorder: i think this might be a big one, my last therapist, i saw her for a year and she was probably the person i've been most honest with about anything in my life. unfortunately i lost that ability after she sent me to a hospital. but she said it really sounded like i might have bpd from some of the things i say. i feel empty a lot of the time, its always kind of like a sad empty. but not really sad, if that makes any sense. like i want to cry but i just feel like i dont have the ability to. and then when something happens, the emotion i get should be only a little bit, but since theres just something there to fill the emptiness i feel it a million times stronger than i should be feeling it. i also have been in love with the same woman for like 8 years, and i feel like she's the decider of my emotions. im so scared of losing her because shes everything to me, i dont have anything but her so what do i have if shes gone. shes tried leaving me in the past before and when she does i just cut the shit out of myself because i just forget i exist without her, the pain reminds me that im there. and yes i know thats like the edgiest cringiest thing but its really how i feel, shes been the majority of the reason of my suicide attempts too. ive felt like ive loved other women since ive loved her but i start getting these thoughts that i convinced myself to fall out of love with her temporarily or something because i dont want to love her? i cant really explain it, but basically my mind fucks me into believing i love her no matter if i love her or hate her or dont even give a shit and i know its my mind fucking with me but the possibility of it being the truth confuses me, i fucking hate it. i dont even know why i think i hate her sometimes becuase i have no reason to hate her but i never take out the anger on her because there's no reason to but im so angry anyway and i take it out on others by just screaming and smashing everything in my sight and sometimes hitting others, i fucking hate my rage episodes but i cant do anything about it. and i just get high off of weed whenever i can because it makes things bearable, ive been abusing my adderall so much that i dont even get high anymore unless i take an insane amount. i just hide so much of who i am because im so scared it will be the end of me. man i could max out like 10 reddit posts about why i think i have this disorder alone but i want to get on to the rest of this too so.

schizophrenia: this is one that i can't tell if i even have because i've been denying the chance that i have it for my whole life, but its been lingering in my mind for soooo long and this is the first i ever say about it to anyone other than my head. ive been denying it because, when you think of a fucking batshit crazy person, this is the type of disorder, and i want to believe that i'm not actually that crazy. but at this point i just kind of accept that i'm past being normal so whatever. so, i think i wrote a lot in my last paragraph that could fit just as well into this part, so im not gonna rewrite all of that. in addition to whatever seemed schizophrenic from the last thing, im just paranoid of so much more than just losing people. like im concerned 24/7 that people are thinking bad thoughts about me, like everyones just kind of watching my every move and taking note of it. even some random person walking down the street might be just noting what im doing. and i don't think they're giving that information to the government or anything like that schizophrnia stereotype, but who knows what they could be doing with the information? that just freaks me out. and its like there's a voice that just tells me when they're watching, when they're judging, what theyre saying. and i think im not supposed to believe it but i dont know what to believe. and then i get scared that people know what im thinking, thats the worst one. when im around people i just try to shut off my own mind because im scared they're gonna know but the voice just doesn't wanna stop. and im just paranoid that im being watched and judged over EVERYTHING, it makes doing anything so hard that i just avoid most things. im 18 years old and just starting driving too, and i hate it so much i want to cry every time im driving because im so scared other people are thinking im a bad driver and are going to call the police on me for reckless driving or something and i just have anxiety attacks every time i drive. also about the voice, i cant tell if theres multiple voices or not but there's been 1 distinct voice and its my own. i always thought it was just my conscience or something but its like i just talk to myself in my head about everything and try to convince myself what's happening isn't the truth. or maybe it's not actually me, i dont know. that's probably the biggest problem i just have to QUESTION everything that happens, like i can't tell whats real and whats my mind fucking with me or what's actually just not even happening at all. to be honest i doubt anyone is even reading at this point, and if they are i dont know why, maybe it's for a good reason but my mind is just trying to convince me that you're doing it to hurt me. and i know that is irrational but what if it's the truth. i see things sometimes too, i hear things a lot more than i see things. just random things, ill just imagine a guy walking buy or someone calling my name or saying things to me. it gets crazy when im high too, i know weed is a very mild psychedelic but i hallucinate and get paranoid more than anyone i've ever heard of on weed, like i get some shrooms type effects from small amounts of weed and im pretty sure that's not supposed to happen. i've also had this reccuring thought since i was really young, that im the only one who actually exists. like, there's no way for me to know if anything even existed before i did and that's so scary, because it means either i sort of am responsible for everything that happens, and maybe my mind just made up history and how people are and etc. and there's a lot of fucked up things in history so if i created all those things then i'm really fucked up. and when there are other people, theres no way to know if they're actually real and not just some emotionless thing there that i created. and then i start thinking, what does anything even matter because i made it all up anyway. but if i do something bad then i can go to jail or some other consequence, and thats stupid because i made the consequences, and i just get lost in my mind and i freak out. this is the kind of stuff that happens so often and i hate it I HATE IT SO FUCKING MUCH ITS LIKE LIVING IN HELL. I DONT WANT TO LIVE IN MENTAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE BUT THIS IS WHAT GOES ON IN MY HEAD EVERY DAY. THINKING ABOUT THIS MAKES ME THINK IM CRAZY AND I KNOW NO ONE IS GONNA READ THIS WITHOUT THINKING IM EITHER BULLSHITTING OR CRAZY OR FUCKING STUPID OR SOMETHING I DONT CARE I PROMISE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. AND NOW THAT I STARTED THINKING PEOPLE AREN""T GOING TO BELIEVE ME I CANT EVEN BELIEVE IF WHAT I WROTE WAS REALLY TRUE. PLEASE SOMEONE FUCKING HELP ME TELL ME THIS IS A REAL ILLNESS I DONT EVEN CARE IF ITS SCHIZOPHRENIA OR NOT ANYMORE JUST TELL ME THAT ITS MY MIND FUCKING WITH ME,  ",25Jan2017,2

11,"I don't really know where to put this. Was searching around and just stumbled upon this subreddit. So i myself study psychology, although i dont know everything i know the basics and some in in depth subjects. However its difficult to deal with your own problems even though you know what you ought do. 

Now i am not going to go in depth mainly because im on my phone and dont feel like sitting here for an hour writing the full story. Long story short, i experienced trauma from losing someone close. It wasn't the fact that i lost them but in the way that i lost them that bothered me the most. They were just gone with no explanation and the person was my therapy from a previous incident. Not having anyone to sort of keep me on track led into a downfall up until i basically took on an entire new personality. (Im not talking about DID here, just a change). I change into a psychopath who wants to cause pain to others. Not through physical means but as much emotional pain possible because that is the way i felt when the incident happened. It can be an instant flip in personality. When someone repeats the incident i just go into this state where i could basically kill my own family and have no remorse or emotion doing it or after. I am a very loving guy. I believe in peace, but i guess all those years of bottle up and displaced emotion created this alternate personality where one minute i can be completely fine and then the next have an episode. I just dont know how to resolve this problem. It only occurs when someone triggers it. No i dont have any therapist. Im good on that. Ive been to enough psychiatrists in my life. Im not a fan of them. ",25Jan2017,1

15,"I am realizing that a good portion of feeling like I am in a black hole of never getting better is due to one or more detrimental cycles.

Example: Feeling not good enough (with where I am in life) causes severe stress, binge eating to relieve stress, gaining weight from binge eating, lower self esteem from being the heaviest I have ever been, feeling even more not good enough.

It's not going to stop unless I make a concerted effort to eliminate or at the very least alleviate some of the sections of these cycles. I would feel accomplished even if I just slowed it down so it wouldn't be escalating as quickly.

26,"Hello redditors, I would appreciate your advises because I really don't know what to do anymore.

A little backstory

We are a family of 5 males and 1 female. I am the youngest of the family and most of the times I am the one on giving out advice to my brothers and sister. Of course being the youngest I am not always heard as I should. My siblings are around the age of 40-50 and I am 33.

One of my brothers has always been the misfit and everybody except me were judgemental to him. I always calmly tried to support him and advice him.

6 Years ago my brother had a huge accident with his bike and was in a coma for a month or so and had a long recovery extending to about two years. At that time my mom took him in helping him during the recovery process. At the same time his wife gave birth to their son.

The last 4-5 years I watched my brother withdrawing to him self and handling situations really badly. Eventually he ended up having misunderstandings with a lot of our relatives and his friends. At the same time he was telling stories of how this or that relative treat him badly. I din't have a way to find out who is right or wrong but again I was supportive telling him to remove this negative energy he was having.

This one last year the situation deteriorated badly. My brother claims that his wife treated him like shit and that she was sleeping around. Eventually they divorced but he has an obsession with her but instead of realising this obsession he says that all he does is for the sake of his son.

To make matters really worst he claims that our mom actually told her wife to divorce him so she hates her now.
Also my sister got into this by having my brother's ex to come over with their son so he can be with my sister's sons and play with them.

Now the situation is that he claims that my sister and his ex are into having sex with a lot of people and my sister's husband knows about that and actually endorse it.

I can't verify his claims but I am pretty sure that he is delusional, because a couple of times when I tried to verify his claims, the facts didn't add up. As an example, last Sunday he was out of his mind that his ex and my sister they were out in the morning fucking around. What they actually did is to take the kids to the cinema and because her ex did not answer her phone, this whole plot came to realisation in his mind.

One of his main claims is that he behaves like this because he worries for his son but 95% of his talking is how much of a slut his ex is. This got me to the conclusion that he actually has an obsession with his ex.

At the same time after the latest events my sister and brother-in-law felt threatened and considered taking actions against my brother...not good actions...to the point my sister told me if we (the male parts of the family) did not do anything about him she will hire someone to beat him up...not pretty stuff. So I asked her to give me some time to figure out what to do.

So I gathered all of my brothers and told them to stop being judgemental any more and consider their brother as a sick person who needs help. My brothers all agreed to that and I told them I would try to convince him to seek some help. I did tried several times (not just in the last month) to talk him into seeking help but never came to a result.

This last time we talked, I lost my patience and became really angry at his claims, we had a huge talk-fight over the situation and at that point I realised that I could't do anything anymore, because this whole thing started to affect me and how I react to his claims.
So I decided to cut the cord and told him that I don't want to listen to his problems anymore and he has to find some medical help immediately. This got him to respond really badly to me (This is the first time doing it to me), and told me he doesn't want to talk with me for a long time. So I sent him a message via messenger. I quote.

&gt;Yesterday I realised three things.
&gt;
&gt;1.	I can’t keep calm anymore dealing with any of your issues, so &gt;I choose to disengage. 
&gt;
&gt;2.	It’s been a long time that you’re asking me to choose sides. &gt;Moreover you’re asking me to stand against my own mother and &gt;sister. I hope you can respect the fact that I won’t do that and &gt;also that I won’t stand against you as I never did.
&gt; 
&gt;3.	I have been close to you this whole time after the accident as &gt;I watched you drag yourself in situations where everybody is to &gt;blame. I explained a million times that this blaming game won’t &gt;lead anywhere. And here we are now.
&gt;
&gt;Also let me tell how exactly your behaviour has been these last &gt;years. You fuck things up somehow blaming this and that for any &gt;reason. I am telling you that you need to relax and be calm, and &gt;you always tell me that I am somehow right and what you want is &gt;to get this money (from the house or the insurance or whatever) &gt;and be left alone and you won’t bug anyone anymore. And this &gt;endless cycle goes on and on.
&gt;
&gt;So I am telling you now…it’s all at your hand. Break the cycle or &gt;stay in it and be miserable. If you decide to continue as is then I &gt;can’t help anymore…if you decide to do something differently at &gt;any time, then I stand by you.
  
So, after connecting the dots of these last years I think my brother has some kind of psychosis and creates delusions in his mind. Moreover that accident must caused the psychosis to get worst.

I am not left with much choices really and the action I am yet willing to take is to gather again the brothers so we can figure out what to do.

I desperately need your help redditors...I am out of options.

Thanks

37,"My Mom lives in Michigan and is 60 years old.  She is suffering from depression and anxiety and I believe she is an undiagnosed Hypochondriac.  This is causing her to avoid social situations, travel (staying in hotels, eating out, flying planes), and effecting her work.  She has self-diagnosed multiple health problems over the past 10 years including serious food allergies, serious allergies to perfumes and other scents, hypersensitivity to touch, always feeling cold, and a muscle strain lasting the past 2 years which she claims has not improved from physical therapy or medication.  The scent allergies trigger panic attacks and have caused her to miss work or restrict her job duties.  

In addition to her mental health issues in the past 2 years she has:

* Lost her second husband to a brain tumor and fought with his family over the estate.

* Been the victim of a wire fraud Romance Scammer who took her for her entire savings and most of her retirement funds.

* Is on the brink of foreclosure and serious financial trouble.

While she is still capable of working it has affected her work performance (leaving early because of panic attacks, avoiding work duties that could trigger them) and she badly needs a new job with better pay and more hours.  At 60, I’m afraid she’ll face age discrimination and doubts about her ability to work as a nurse on a regular floor shift.  I’m afraid that she can’t pay for proper treatment, and her employability is pretty poor.  The short term problem for her is her financial situation and our family is in talks about helping her with that, but the long term help she needs is really mental health treatment.  If going on disability for mental health would provide the help she needs, I think it’s worth exploring.  

So here’s what I want to ask:

What generally qualifies someone for Disability Benefits for Mental Health?  

Does it have to be bad enough to be a condition that utterly doesn’t allow them to function in a job or supporting themselves?  Like Severe Schizophrenia, Bipolar, etc?

Am I thinking the requirements are too stringent here and there lesser mental health issues that would be allowed?

If lesser forms of mental illness qualify then what would other requirements be?  Risk of harm to self? Risk of harm to others?  Proof of being incapable of working?

Would it take being admitted to a treatment facility to start that application process?
How much do health insurance benefits typically cover for that?

Assuming she sought in patient treatment for a length of time and committed to therapy how long of a process would it typically be to qualify for benefits?

I can go into much more detail describing her issues and situation if it would help those commenting on this.

44,"This is the first time, and I guess a first step and attempt of uncovering what may be a very, very dark fragment of my past, or not. Over the past two years, and currently I've basically kept coming to the question: Is it possible that I have been sexually assaulted as a child?

In the last year I battled very heavy depression, and succeeded (yay!). It included taking a leave from my studies, searching and finally finding an appropriate therapist and even a voluntary stay at a sanatorium (a clinic that specialised in the treatment of depression through psychotherapy, their core concept was facing your traumata's and what caused the depression).
During that year I've realised and learned a lot. I learned that I had kept certain parts of me locked away because I couldn't face it. Overall, I can see within that last year and in that battle, I finally after nearly 15 ish years managed to find myself.

Before I even knew or realised that I was suffering under depression I was suffering, without a sense. I thought I was just too weak and that everyone would experience what I experienced. 
It was during this time where panic attacks started to form and in extreme cases a physical paralysis. It was also in this time where the thought for my question was sparked:

While at home, out of nowhere and without any context words formed in my mind: ""What if I had been sexually assaulted as a child?"" That moment was so strong, that it initiated the first panic attack and the first experience of that kind of paralysis. All I could feel was utter and complete terror, even just thinking IF such a possibility existed.
At this point I should mention that at the time, a vast majority of memories from my past were not accessible to me. It seemed like there were fragments, images here and there but not a coherent string of memories, most of them clouded in some kind of mist. 

The following night, I had a very terrifying nightmare. The thing abou this is, I usually don't have this. And it felt like a half-awake dream. Looking back at it, in a way it felt like my subcounscious opening up an allowing me in.
The dream was as followed:

I was a child in my home village, walking along the streets with a female friend (who in reality I met far later in my life than my dream age and who didn't live in the same village). It seemed we wanted to meet with other people and we were already late. My friend, taking the lead suggests a shortcut leading through a construction site. I can't really agree nor disagree because she just goes ahead, with me running after her. As she gets to the construction site (I can point to the place from my dream in reality), she jumps off a big pile of dirt, down onto a half finished terrace in construction and leaves through a door that's been built to then meet up with the others. I catch her just as she dissappears with her shouting after me to come. Then it's deadly silent and a strange tension (like in a video game just before a boss fight) sets in. I jump off the same dirt pile but land clumsily.
The moment I touch the ground the lamp on the wall with the door starts shining absurdly brightly striking complete terror into me.
From a dug hole just next to the wall with the door some kind of figure emerges, I think a man. All I can remember is that this figure as shining bright eyes with light coming out of them, just the same light as from the lamp. The figure or man approaches and all I know is that somehow, my counscious 'dreaming' self 'knows': That's when it happens. 'Now he's about to rape me'. And I wake up. 
I don't know, if this is indeed my subcounscious tying to tell me or if it's just a mechanism to shield from something else? That an assault never happened but if there's something else.
In any case, I'M confused and I know that this state makes me incapable of a meaningful relationship of trust, without any shields or protection, or in a sappy way: That it makes me incapable of love.

I don't know why I'm sharing this. I guess I'm looking for someone who can relate or sympathise. Who can share a similar experience or advice. I'm just reaching out I think. I don't want sympathy all I really want is....to know...could it be that it happened? And what am I to do with these enigmatic clues. And maybe I should say again: There are still parts/ years of my memory that still seem not to be present. Which is why, I can't exclude it not happening even though I have no memories of such a possibility.  

There have been other possible 'signs' but listing them might explode this already very long outreach so I will leave it at that. 
If anyone wants to answer or listen to reach out to me in return, please let me know.

I'm fine overall, as I said I came out of that battle better than ever and would consider myself pretty happy. Though maybe the fact that I overcame all that just means I can now look at the other things to tackle (like a new level).

In any case, thank you for reading and your time.
And I wish you (anonymous reader I don't know) all the best.

45,"TLDR is at the bottom. 

I'm 22 years old and a few months ago I had to temporarily move back in to my parent's house due to financial struggles. They're good parents. Not perfect, but nobody is. They love me very much and they help me out whenever I need it. They've always had my back. 

However, for whatever reason, I feel extremely uncomfortable around them. I've been diagnosed with major depression, general anxiety, and Borderline Personality Disorder. But, for the life of me I can't connect anything to why I feel so uneasy around my parents. I get major anxiety with the upset stomach and heavy chest. And my depression gets worse too. If they start talking about anything beyond work or chores, I shut down. 

This has progressively been getting worse. I've never had a super close relationship with them. But slowly, any relationship I did have is being dissolved. It's gotten to the point where I don't physically touch them at all, I avoid all eye contact, and I try to avoid almost any contact at all. I've tried to just push through it and develop a relationship again, but every time I just feel like I need to be anywhere else.

I don't know what's happening and it's scary. I love my parents, and I've tried to explain to them what is happening but they get understandably hurt. There's no major event or breakdown between us to explain this. So why is it happening?!? Even if I am upstairs in my room, the sound of them moving around will make my skin crawl. I stay petrified in my bed until I can't hear any trace of them. 

And I should specify that it is only them. I have normal anxiety around most people, but it's maintainable. For some reason, I just can't stand to be around my parents. 

Please help me if you can! If anybody has ever experienced this, or can help me understand why, I would greatly appreciate it. 

TL;DR: 22, living with good parents. For unknown reason I get major major anxiety around them. It's ruining our relationship and I'm at a complete loss. ",25Jan2017,1

48,"Hi,

Ive had on and off depression for quite some time now and have always had general anxiety. Recently the anxiety has been getting to the point where i feel nearly unable to function.

Ive been worrying about everything. When i say everything, i don't just mean the usual stuff (money, marital, arguments from 10 years ago), but ive been worrying about what the point in anything and everything is. Whats the point in going to work? Whats the point in paying taxes? Why is life the way it is, because, to be honest, everything fucking sucks.

I cant properly put it into words. I used to think when i was younger that ""there must be a reason why im me"" if you know what i mean. I can only see the world from my first person perspective. i thought i may be somehow special because of this. Now im beginning to realise that in the grand scheme of things, im fuck all. Everything we do doesnt matter. I go to work and have some dickhead tell me what to do, thats all i know so i do it. But why should i? Why does the world have to be that way? Money is just an illusion. It sucks. Politicians make decisions for us. They suck. Spend all my time working a job i hate because i have to. Its all fucking pointless. I feel like we are all wasting our lives on the illusion of life we have created ourselves.

I know im rambling and i dont know if it makes sense but i cant stop feeling this way. It gets me so down and so worried that we are all just wasting our lives. And the worst part is that it won't change. Thats how things are. Its shit.

Does anyone else feel this way or at least understand what i mean? Or does anybody know how to stop feeling this way?",25Jan2017,2

50,"My dog is an ESA dog as well as a service dog. Meaning, I have a housing/airline document from a licensed therapist for flying/living with an ESA dog. When the dog finished learning his complex cues, he became my service dog, although in all honesty we are still working on public manners, that might take an additional few months until he's done. He helps with a variety tasks. 

We are moving to a new place, the real estate agent is forcing a $500 fee just for the dog and said if we don't agree to it he will give the house to someone else. Nice.",25Jan2017,10
51,"A Letter to my Addiction.

No More
Written By R.K.

“Have you ever loved someone so much, you’d give an arm for? 
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her”
Eminem: “When I’m Gone”

Everyone has something or someone that directly relates to this quote in someway, shape, or form. The proverbial “her” in my case is referring to my family and close friends. My situation is unique as it does not begin the way a stereotypical addiction story begins. No broken homes or traumatic childhood experiences here, quite the opposite in fact. I come from a healthy household surrounded by loving family members inside the brick walls and an unsurpassed quality of friends outside of them, friends whom I first met over 20 years ago. I went to good grade schools, was considered a gifted child (believe it or not) and was doing school work a year ahead of my class. I didn’t realize it at the time, but my life was set. All I had to do was keep doing what I was doing and keep pushing forward. Everything was sunshine and rainbows, right up until I met a new “friend”. I didn’t know how I felt about this friend at first since I didn’t know anything about them. I must have been wearing sunglasses at the time considering I failed to see the dark cloud closely following that “friend”, not noticing how exponentially larger the shadow was compared to the figure casting it. Sunglasses on, I kept hanging out with said friend since it seemed kinda cool at the time, cool enough for me to want that friend to come around more often. This turned out to be a series unforeseen mistakes which ultimately paved the way to my demise.

At first, friend, you were pretty awesome. You came to hang out at parties, making the nights more eventful and exciting. Unfortunately this opened a set of floodgates thousands of miles away, floodgates similar to the ones Treebeard released on Isengard to help save Middle Earth. However, these destructive waters that were headed my way weren’t coming to save anyone, they weren’t coming to diminish any evil and they weren’t coming to water the plants or feed the crops. The only thing they were going to do was obliterate everything in their path while morphing things that took years to build into a rural wasteland, ultimately changing the way that people looked at that piece of land. Perhaps forever. Everything seemed fine in my apparently gifted mind, me having been mistaken would be an understatement. You, my friend, were deceiving me. You did not want to be my friend. You never wanted to be my friend. What I can see now is that was your elaborate cover up to start taking everything of mine. I must say, you masked your deception quite well. I was the King deep in slumber and while I was dreaming, you were taking my Pawns, my Bishop’s, my Knights and Rooks, and my Queen. 

At first you only wanted my free time, and I was ok with that. Then you got greedy, you wanted more. You wanted my money, you wanted my friends, you wanted the girls that I liked and the family that I loved. You “wanting” ultimately led to you taking. You took my personality, you took my laughter and you took my laid back attitude, you took all of it. That’s not even the worst part, the worst part is you somehow made me not care. You somehow made this former gifted child's mind into a slave, your slave.

“I Am Whatever You Say I Am”
Eminem: “The Way I Am”

	I used to be the guy in the first quote. Over the span of 10 years, you changed me into the guy in that last one. Luckily, I had something that you did not foresee, an ace up my sleeve if you will. An ace that unknowingly made its way up my sleeve over 20 years ago. Just as it seemed like you were winning the war, the sun rose on the 5th day at Helm’s Deep, reinforcements have arrived. And the reinforcements brought reinforcements, all of whom rode in on white horses. Ground support was abundant and helped me fight back, but it still wasn’t enough to slay the dragon. An investment in air support needed to be made. With ground and air support at my disposal I am now able to attack from all directions and defend against all flanks. Your time is up and the end is near, your reign of terror WILL come to an end.

Boots on the ground, wings in the air
To get rid of you there was no prayer.
You won many battles in the past
I refuse to be the one who finishes last. 
You will not be the one wins this war
I am whatever you say I am no more.

53,"I have a (probably) anxiety-related issue where my stomach/lungs/throat steadily starts churning, tightening, frothing, etc. This makes me first feel uncomfortable, then it gets painful then I feel nauseated. Finally I get extreme pain and throw up (which doesn't make it go away). 

The odd thing is the cure is simply lying down. As soon as I can lie down for a while all the symptoms go away. 

I had medical checks that found nothing so I got CBT for three years. I get it less often now but it still happens regularly and is easily the worst thing in my life. I hate it and feel I have almost no control over it. The best I can do is lie down in a park or on the train or wherever I can to avoid the symptoms when I'm away from my bed. 

If you've heard of anything similar or have any ideas for me I'd be very grateful to hear. It may be similar to some forms of IBS, but I don't think it's really connected to what I eat or drink. ",25Jan2017,3
