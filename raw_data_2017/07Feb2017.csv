If I quit, I will be able to sort things out, spend all my time practice English listening and do some freelancing work which can both keep food on the table and give me a sense of controlling my own life.

However, I may also end up rumination by being alone. My mental problems are mainly caused by over thinking ",07Feb2017,2

My mind has been my worse enemy for the entirety of my life. I have tried to die but I can't. I have self medicated but it didn't help. I have been on meds and been to counselling and it didn't help.


I am left with no concept of time, lack of human emotion, a deep darkness inside and an existential understanding that has left me in despair. A lot of relatives have commited suicide and nearly all the rest can't stand life. Where to go now seems unclear. Death is not an option but life is pain.",07Feb2017,2
4,"I'm really struggling right now and I don't know what to do. I use Reddit all the time so I thought I'd post up here to see if anyone has any advice.

My wife, son and I moved to Australia from a rural part of the UK in March of last year. Personally I had some family issues, my wife has mental health issues (depression and emetophobia - fear of vomiting) and we lived in a rural area which is commonly voted the worst in the UK to live.

I felt that coming to Australia would help my wife become more independent, stronger and maybe help her through some of her issues. I understand there is no ""cure"" for depression though - please don't pick me up wrong.

My wife's brother and family also live here who she is pretty close to so I felt that would be a good support for her.

My son is at the age where he needs to go into a nursery/kindergarten to mix with other kids, however with my wife's fear of illness and sickness she has held off putting him daycare because she can't deal with him when he's sick. Unfortunately in the time we've lived in Australia my son has had a couple of sickness bugs which hasn't meant I've had to take quite a bit of time off work to care for him as my wife simply can't.

One of the big draws to the UK for her is that her Mum is there full time to be on hand for support. When we lived in the UK and I was at work and my son was sick my mother-in-law would come over, take over and deal with everything. That's not necessarily a slight on my MIL it's just a symptom of my wife saying she can't cope with illness/sickness and passing it on to my MIL to deal with.

Sadly she has spent the whole time we are here pining for the UK and it has came to the point where she has given me the ultimatum - come home with me or I'm going home on my own (with my son).

I love my wife so much and she often calls us soulmates which I feel the same about. But right now we can barely talk and it is really affecting my feelings for her. It kills me inside seeing her mental health issues rule her life. The reality is we need to move back to the UK because I simply cannot be without my son. I can't live in a flat/apartment on my own whilst he lives with his mum and, one day, is brought up by some other guy. I know people say ""don't stay together because of the kids if you're unhappy""...but being apart from my son would make me so unhappy I don't know how I could get through the days. I feel I could probably fake everything else just to be with my son because he means more to me than anything else. The thought of only seeing him every other weekend makes me suicidal.

If I could paint a picture of where we were in the UK and where we are right now in Australia you would wonder why we'd ever consider going back, but that is the reality forced upon me and my son right now. I should point out that our Australian visa will be revoked after we leave Australia for 12 months. This essentially means my wife, son and I cannot live in Australia again - the door would be closed.

I am estranged from my brother and my relationship with my parents is ok but not fantastic and I can't face losing anyone else. But I fear that my life decisions are now coming back to bite me in the ass.

They say that ""not everyone gets to be happy"" - however when the penny drops that you're one of those people it's a bitter pill to swallow.",07Feb2017,3

I am a teenager and have been seeing a therapist for a few months now. She thinks I have depression and would like me to see a psychiatrist to get medicine for it. I agree with her, but unfortunately my mom doesn't. She would rather have me take assorted vitamins and try holistic 'medicine' rather than take any medication prescribed for me. She believes that the scientists at the FDA are paid off to lie about medicine and that they're corrupt. I've tried talking with her about taking medicine or going to see a psychiatrist to get the help I need but she won't even go to talk to a psychiatrist with me. Is there anything I can do in my situation?

13,"""Cutter""

Staring at the blood drops On my razor 

Thinking to myself ""there must be something greater

Than trading pain for a different kind of pain

In a desperate attempt to erase my stain""

My hands will shake like a junkie in withdrawal

Until I give into sickness and simply fall

Back into the habit I've had since thirteen

When everything felt too much and the kids were so mean

Keeping it hidden under my sweater

Please grant my wish and make it all better

I don't want to feel anymore

So I'll break the skin and settle the score

For that little moment of numb

I know you all think it's dumb

But I have no choice but to hurt myself

To escape my little personal hell

At least that's what the voice in my head is saying

That ""living's as useless as kneeling and praying""

So why do I listen, why can't I resist?

When I know that I'm loved and that I'll be missed?

The future doesn't matter when I'm hurting now

And of this habit I'm not proud

So the blood will keep on flowing

From a pain I'm not outgrowing

Despite all that I've been told

I'll be in agony until I'm old

14,"So, when I was little I was sexually abused on a couple different occasions and, when I was a little older, physically abused by my teacher. These experiences have left me with plenty of emotional issues, which I won't go in depth on. Here's the summary: Intense social anxiety (the kind that makes it hard to leave my house without panicking and often having full blown panic attacks), major depression, and I experience a lot of depersonalisation (the experience of feeling disconnected from your body, even though you know logically you are in your body.) I experience depersonalisation quite a lot, and usually very intense, but I don't quite meet the requirements for depersonalisation disorder. So basically, I thought I was beginning to move on from these issues. After attempting to take my life twice and undergoing extensive treatment, my anxiety was much lower and the depression almost not there at all. The depersonalisation was still very much there, but that's just one of those things that is probably not going away. But then it started to creep back. I've started digging around to try and find out more about my traumas in early childhood, and I know the digging is triggering a lot of these emotions for me, so the logical answer is to just stop digging. But the thing is, I've now gotten to a point where I can't not think about it. The trauma that I thought I had moved on from has now become something I'm immersed in. Flashbacks have been coming more regularly. All of this constant thinking about it makes me more anxious and upset, which just leads to more thinking about it, and I really don't know how to stop the cycle. I know I need to tell my therapist everything and ask for help, but I don't know how to talk to her. She's a relatively new therapist, and I am terrified of telling her about everything, even though she's not a scary person at all. I know this has gone on for a while, but does anyone have any suggestions of either how I can help myself or bring it up with my therapist?   ",08Feb2017,1

31,"Serious answers please
So me and my wife are at the vacation at the moment in Thailand. We invited her brother(28yo) and his girlfriend to join us for a few weeks and they did. Little that we know is that he seems to be going through some serious mental breakdown. Before the trip he seemed to be studying some kind of numerology books or something like that or maybe the fact that he's working in the military has something to do with it, anyway. Now every evening we see him very scared, he can't sleep through the night and is constantly making up stuff in his mind like if he falls a sleep we will all die or that all the native people here are dead or  that colors try to tell him something or just stuff like that. We are not sure on how to handle this since we still have a few weeks with him here and psychologist is definitely in line after this. When we talk with him he seems to understand that this is messed up but but his mind probably is not under his control and he always searches for 'signs' where it just not makes sense to us all.

35,"Hi r/mentalhealth!

Throwaway because my friends know my reddit username. I have been thinking about doing this post for a very long time, but I have been hesitant to do it as I am afraid to label whats actually going on in my head..

I have had a rough life when it comes to my mother, as she is an alcoholc, pill abusing and suicidal woman that has tried to kill herself several times (one of the times I was home alone with her as a little girl). I try to stay positive with my life, and I have some extremely happy moments and are blessed with having awesome people in my life. But sometimes it seems as the past and the whole situation with my mother just drags me down into a very sad, depressed state.

However, I don’t think I suffer of depression, as I love living, and all the happy moments in my life. But today, driving home from work (40 min drive) I cried the whole way thinking about how much I wanted my mother to jut be normal, and for us two to have a happy, normal mother/daughter realationship. I want her to be well so badly, but I feel totally helpless as I can’t seem to help her in any way=/ I have no control of when these moments happen or what triggers it, and I find it exhausting.. I can literally go from feeling like the happiest girl alive, to extremely depressed within seconds. Anyone know what this can be..? I’ve never talked to anyone about this, so I’ve never been “diagnosed” for anything..",08Feb2017,0

40,"I have a good friend whom is bi polar, has multi personality disorder, and is currently off medications. He hates pills and has been using marijuana for several years to keep himself stable. Unfortunately he has run out and does not have money for more. He is a video game addict, as in his mind video games is all he has in his life to keep him going.

We created a guild in a game we play and the other day he had a fit of rage and yelled at everyone, cursing some people out for no reason, and has caused a lot of anger, resentment, and frustration amongst the other players. I am one of his good friends but also an officer of the guild.

Our guild that we put a lot of work into building is ripping apart now over the incident, and the only way we can fix the situation is to remove my friend from the guild. As an officer I have to do whats best for the guild as a whole, but I worry about his mental health. How can I best approach him, to tell him he is being removed from the guild in the game, and cause as minimal stress and damage as possible?

I know he will flip out as he is a video game addict, but I need to find a way to minimize the affect this will have on his over all health.

She frequently wants to talk about her experiences but I'm not sure how to be supportive. My personal opinion is that the psychoanalyst forces her to aggressively confront her issues without offering solutions.

51,"I have no idea how to go about this. 

The background info; I [17 almost 18f] had a really difficult time growing up, fell into a cycle of self harm, self hatred and feeling depressed from the age of 13~15. Used to get extremely anxious about even simple things like going to buy milk or walking into class. Previously had some panic attacks when things got really bad. After this point in my life (leaving secondary school) I managed to pick myself back up and got a really positive mindset, stopped self harming and I didn't have anymore suicidal thoughts. Figured it was probably just my hormones or it was just down to me having zero confidence. Fast forward almost 3 years to now and I am absolutely lost. 

I am so stressed. I can't function. I am juggling a stressful job alongside college, a shit relationship, sleeping difficulty, issues with my appearance, my future,...The list just doesn't end and I'm feeling so overwhelmed. I just keep having meltdowns, even over things like missing the bus. It's causing me to skip whole weeks of college and leaves me emotionally paralysed for days, meaning I just sit there and can't think or do anything. Even something like trying to get dressed and get out of my house in the morning stresses me to the point that I can't move and then end up staying inside all day. It's leaving me so drained and I have put on weight, my grades are suffering and I am constantly on edge from the moment I wake up until I fall asleep.

At first I thought this was just normal stress? Everyone gets very stressed at some point in their lives right? I honestly don't know. I'm beginning to feel like maybe it's not natural and maybe there is something wrong with me. Should I go and see a doctor? A counsellor? I literally have no idea but it's just getting rapidly worse and worse and I'm really struggling. What the fuck do I do? Why does this absolutely paralyse me? Is this still me growing up or is something wrong with me?

Edit: forgot to mention early last year I went through like 7 months of having a hormone implant and being on the pill. It fucked my cycles up and made me super depressed so I came off of both. Could that have had an affect or caused this? ",08Feb2017,2
