0,"Hi I'm a 19yo male, and Honestly I came here in search of someone to talk to about, Well just alot of things, I've been through alot of life for someone my age. I've been told I have ADHD, Autism, anxiety disorder, depression, and that I could be a sociopath or psychopath... and many more. Have Not been to a doctor in about 6 years and Honestly don't want to go, can't either due to no money. But it'd be nice to have someone to talk to when things get tough or act up",19Nov2017,2
1,"Why am I afraid my friend is going to hate me, leave me, or be upset with me, if I don't reply to her messages immediately.  I used to feel really weird so I'd say ""I'm going to bed now"" or something along those lines to let her know I wouldn't reply. I had a lot of stuff to do today, and I haven't logged onto facebook because of that.  Why do I feel a compulsive need to make sure everything's okay? My psychiatrist, the first one, who knew me well, told me I might have OCD a long time ago (I kid you not).  When I think about it, maybe I do have this problem. I hoard things, for one. I don't like throwing things out. I'm obsessive about morality (though this could be due to a PD) and I don't like breaking rules.  So if something says DO NOT... I won't. Same with filling in forms, or applications, I double, triple, quadruple check stuff.  Same issue in school. I would obsess about minor things.  I don't think all of my OCD like behaviors have to do with things. I think a lot of them were social, and maybe she picked up on that.  I didn't believe her at the time, and when she gave me that pamphlet I tossed it away.",19Nov2017,1
2," Hi all, I've been going through a rough patch recently. I noticed a pattern that I act on impulse and allow my emotions control me. It has definitely impacted my relationships negatively. 

I started meditating, writing in gratitude journals, yet I need another method. I grew up in a rough background where my parents treated each other negatively (lots of arguments every day and stayed together for the kids). 

I need help. I want to feel better and be able to not let my emotions control me. Is there any method or way you've tried and worked?

Thank you!",19Nov2017,6
3,"Bit of a long post, so if you don’t want to read no worries. 

Right, for as long as I can remember I’ve struggled to concentrate on work / studying. It’s always felt as if there’s like a fog in my brain that stops me from focusing. Every time I sit down to work I can last anywhere from like 30 seconds to a few minutes, then it hits. My vision goes a little bit blurry – the best way I can describe it is if you were to cross your eyes slightly, everything goes slightly out of focus, and you feel like your perspective has been drawn back a bit – and I zone out completely. This happens literally all the time and I can never get through it. Really really has impacted on my studiying during my time at school and it seems to have gotten worse in recent years - in my final year of University at the moment. 

I really don’t understand what’s going on. Just hoping someone might know what it could be?

If anyone comments or suggests anything, thank you in advance :) ",19Nov2017,1

29,"I don’t want to get too personal and this is my throwaway accounts. My husband(26) and I(22) both live in the U.S and we’ve been married for 3 years dated for 4.

He google searched “suicide attempts”, “ how to kill your self with pills at home”, and a few other related searches. I dealt with severe depression and suicidal thoughts for a good 4 years of my life and it wasn’t until I met my husband and moved out of my toxic environment that things started to look up for me.  I should’ve know better than to confront him about it the way  I did but I panicked.  I woke him up from his sleep and asked why he searched those things and if he is going to kill himself.  He said he was bored and looked these things up because he was watching a Netflix show where the main character killed herself.

31,"TL;DR: I went to two different emergency rooms and a GP for help during a suicidal episode but it seemed like nobody took me seriously. I'm in QLD Australia, and I don't have private insurance.

Sorry, this post is long AF.
I have depression, anxiety, PTSD and the jury is still out on a bipolar II diagnosis (still testing medications for reactions, etc.) I normally deal with a kind of passive suicidal ideation, but for the last week I've been feeling actively suicidal. I made one attempt and was stopped by my loved ones (my two partners and my housemate, all of whom I love so much.) I declined to go to the ER as I had work the next day and couldn't handle the stress of calling my boss. I wasn't thinking rationally and I should have gone, but all I could think about was how frustrated I was that my attempt didn't work. 

Usually, after I make an attempt the feeling of actively wanting to die goes away but this time, it didn't. Two weeks went by and I started to feel more and more suicidal and unhinged, like I was actually losing my mind. I was still worried about missing work however, so I decided to schedule some annual leave in order to have my breakdown. (nuts, I know, but guys, my boss is seriously scary.)

In preparation for this,  I emailed a local acute mental health department and asked them for more information about inpatient procedures. Instead of replying to my email, they called me (how they got my number I don't know) and we organized an appointment for me to speak to someone on Friday morning. I asked my girlfriend if she would take me and she agreed that she would. The day beforehand the anticipation was too much and I planned another attempt during the day to go through with that evening, but my friends and partner found out about it and I promised I'd hold on until tomorrow.

Friday morning came (half an hour before my appointment time) and I get a text asking to reschedule my appointment. At this point I broke down into tears because Id been psyching myself up for this appointment for two days and resisted attempting again because I wanted help. So my girlfriend and housemate took me to the emergency room and I told them how i'd been feeling. Before I went in I was already worried that I wouldn't be taken seriously. When I'm in the midst of an attempt i'm a mess of tears and usually on the ground screaming, but when I've given up hope I get quiet and a little fidgety, which I suppose, for all intents and purposes, makes me look less suicidal than I actually am.

The man who assessed me (Steven. Ugh, seriously, effing Steven) seemed to have already made his mind up about my case before he'd even entered the room, telling me the best course of action was a GP visit and a mental healthcare plan before he'd even really asked me what the problem was. My girlfriend and housemate kept trying to give more information (that I was violent when I attempted, kicking/screaming/etc, that I didn't feel safe anymore, and i'd felt this way for weeks now) but he kept insisting that a psychologist appointment soon was a better option for me, despite my current active desire to attempt, and despite my not feeling safe. He compared my situation to that of another patient, he told me my life was good and that I had effectively nothing to be sad about, and that I should just look on the bright side. He said that he was positive that his supervising Doctor (he was a psych nurse) would say the same thing and so he didn't need to tell them about me or my case.

I had a panic attack and he left the room, irritated, saying my attack was ""behavioural"" (as if I was making it up to get attention? Maybe? I'm not sure what he meant by that) and that he'd come back when I'd calmed down. When he returned he repeated all the same things and at this point I just gave up because I didn't have the energy to protest/didn't want to be labelled uncooperative. I left feeling like I needed to try harder in my next attempt, which is obviously the opposite of what I needed from that consult.

In the car park, I had another panic attack as my girlfriend was calling nearby bulk billing general practices to see if they had availability. None of them did, and when she explained that her girlfriend was currently panicking in a hospital car park because she desperately wanted off the planet but nobody would listen, every single one of them said I needed to go to the ER. 

So after she wasn't able to find a doctor who could see me that day, my girlfriend called the hospital crisis line and asked how we should proceed. She was transferred BACK TO STEVEN who told her that I was being unreasonable (yeah, I'm not thinking rationally, I'm suicidal, it kind of goes with the territory) and that if I really wanted to, I could come back and wait to be seen by a registrar which would be a ""lengthy and emotionally taxing process"" and they would likely say the same thing he said. My girlfriend told him that the doctors she'd spoken to advised her to take me to the ER as I wasn't safe in my current state, and he said AND I QUOTE: ""Oh, GP's are too conservative."" It seemed like GPs over the phone who hadn't even met me were more concerned than Steven was.

We finally got an appointment with a GP for a few hours away and she was sympathetic. She said I needed a two pronged approach, one for immediate results and one for long term growth. She wrote me a mental health plan and psych referral, as well as a letter of recommendation for admission to hospital. She told my friends to ""plant their feet"" at the next ER and insist that I get put somewhere where I would be safe.

With this letter, we went to a different ER and I was taken to psych emergency, where they took my bag (which included my referral letter) and wouldn't let me have it to show the registrar. I was told by one nurse that I could have two visitors accompanying me, (which I did, my girlfriend and my housemate) and when my girlfriend had to leave, my other partner took her place. A few minutes later a different nurse came up and said I could now only have one visitor. It all began to feel like a conspiracy, like they knew I wasn't strong enough to protest being brushed off by myself. 

We waited for a few hours (a horrifying experience in and of itself, so many screaming, hurting, distressed people) before my name was called by a registrar. She refused to let my partner accompany me into the consult room (which made it feel like even more of a conspiracy) She told me bluntly that she'd been in contact with the first hospital and that I shouldn't have come to a second one, even though I'd been instructed to by a GP. She told me if I was ""unsatisfied with my care"" from the first hospital I should have told them that. I wanted to say ""Yes, I should have, but my anxiety disorder makes that a bit difficult sometimes."" What I did say was... nothing. I shut down again. I shut down and felt even more like the whole system was against me. It felt as if Steven had personally decided that I wasn't as distressed as I claimed, and had called another hospital to let them know I'd probably present there as well.
I went home and collapsed, exhausted.

They keep calling me to check up, despite them not seeming to care very much when I presented the first time. Yes, I realize that these hospitals have a lot of patients to care for and things are assessed on a scale, but I was extremely disheartened that someone presenting with a very real mental crisis could be dismissed like that. I've always been told to go to the ER when I feel like attempting suicide, but those two experiences have made me think twice about that.

Has anyone here had a similar experience? What did you do? Thanks for reading my gigantic post.

33,"Hi,

My biggest fear is confiding myself completely to a person. I've noticed in the last years something I  have been doing subconsciously. Whenever I feel like a person is worth talking to, I might confide once to them for about an hour. 

After confiding to a person, I don't see them the same way like I did before. I sort of lose trust in them, despite them doing nothing different. It doesn't matter to me how many times that person has confided to me before I did to them, things only change after I confide to them.

Nowadays, that's not the case anymore. It might sound like a weird, but I kind of confide to myself in my head, kind of like I'm having a conversation inside my mind and to me it feels very much like speaking to a real person. I suppose in other words you could say that I am observing my own thoughts, sometimes commenting/questioning them and other times letting thoughts flow in for what they are, without any judgment.

My question is, how important is it to have someone to talk to about your private thoughts for your mental health? 

Excuse me if anything in this post is vague. English is not my native language and on top of that I generally have a lot of trouble translating my thoughts into words.",19Nov2017,3
34,"Hello all,

My brother's work and personal life has been on a slight decline due to a plethora of issues: a mild video game addiction, lack of time management, inability to focus etc. 

Part of the issue is that I think he needs therapy, but the other issue is that he needs help with project/time managment with work. 

I'm wary of using the term ""life coach"" because I've often heard they're scams, but the idea of a life coach at least is something I think would be worthwhile. The other issue is that he lives in the middle of nowhere so he wouldn't be able to see someone in person.

35,"Me (M26) have a friend (M25) who is possibly battling with depression and I need tips on how to help him through this.

The things I've noticed/know:
*When 4-5 friends gather together, after some time he spaces off and stops communicating with us unless we communicate directly to him.
*He has become unsocial in the sense that he almost never replies in our group chat or answer our calls but when we chat up close or get together he is very responsive and funny (until he spaces off)
*He claims to have a severe stomach issue (some form of regression), he has wasted thousands on examinations and doctors have concluded that the problem is may not be caused by a physical factor. This stomach issue has caused him to lose extreme weight, he was already thin but now I'm pretty sure his physical health may be or will soon be at risk due to this weight loss.
*The possible causes of the above:
 -He is 25 years old and has never had any intimate contact with another girl. This may have nothing to do with it but the rest of us from our close circle of friends have all been in relationships numerous times but he on the other had has never formed any kind of relationship (he has never been intimate with anyone before)
 -He works at the hospital and a few months before this whole thing started he had an incident at work which lead him to believe that he may have contracted a very serious disease from a used needle (used on an ill patient) being injected in him by accident. The results took months to come out and it turned out he was healthy and nothing happened because of that incident, however he describes this period (waiting for the results to come out) as very dramatic/horrifying and the most possible cause of his current symptomps.
*I've lied to him that I have some stress issues from work which are seriously affecting me mentally and I am considering of seeking professional help. This caused him to open up and tell me that he visits a psychiatrist once a week to no apparent results so far (he has been visiting him for months now, not sure how many).
*I have found in his house 2 pill boxes (Zyprexa, one box which contains 10mg and one of 5mg), he doesnt know I've found them and he has only admitted that he takes pills for his stomach which from Googling I understand that these pills are used for treatment of depression (or other compulsive illnesses?). These pills have caused him to faint twice so far which made me try to make him stop which I think it was the wrong move on my behalf as these pills may be the only thing keeping him going even if I see him getting worse in the end.
*extremely long hours of sleep, I understand that this is another sign of depression, he always enjoyed sleeping for long hours but he now does it in a more unpredicted manner and takes event lengthier sleeps than before, for example last night he slept around 5 in the morning and woke up today at 18:00 and when I asked him if he is ok he replied with ""Dude WTF! I've been sleeping this whole time!"", even he was shocked from the amount hours he slept and didnt even realise it.
*besides two incidents he hasnt shown me he may be suicidal
 -the first incident was that I was cooking in his apartment and took the kitchen knife and directed it in his belly and pretended to stab himself. This may be nothing but I would like to mention it in case it is.
 -The second incident is caused by our other friends who at times are not being understanding or compassionate of his situation, they keep pushing him to go out (nightclubs and drinks etc) which he can no longer do at the same frequency he used to due to his stomach issues. This causes them to get frustrated and sometimes be mad at him and cause him to retaliate and his usual response is ""If you were in my position you would have killed yourselves by now, imagine having this strong of regression causing you to wait to get off work to eat because otherwise if you eat at lunch break you cant work afterwards and then when you eat in the afternoon it could take hours for your stomach regression to cool off. I am basically starving all day, I eat once and then I have to suffer"" (something along those lines). I usually talk to him privately when this happens and try to tell him that I get it and that they are only being like this because they want him there and that I am here for whatever he needs and his reaction to this whole situation is understandable, this usually calms him down.

Thank you all so much for reading this and sorry for the length, I am seriously hoping you can give me some tips on how to deal with this situation or direct me to someone who can?

37,"Lately I’ve had a hard time feeling content with where I am in life. I do well enough for myself - I’m a teacher, rent my own place, have great friends and a loving family. 

However, for the last few years I’ve felt pretty stuck. It started when my ex (dated 4 years) and I split. It was tough because we were sure we’d be together forever. The timing just wasn’t right for us. But since then, I almost feel like people just tell me what I want to hear, and aren’t truly genuine. 
I’ve dated since him, but the guys never worked out and frankly, left me feeling like I’m not worth anyone’s time. 

Work has been a roller coaster; I lost my job a couple years ago due to budget controversies. I wasn’t unemployed during the school year, though.  I found a job about an hour from my home, and it’s nice. But I don’t connect with anyone there because most of my coworkers are significantly older than me. My boss has done a lot to have me become a leader here. I feel like I’m treading water and not moving forward, and feel guilty about it. 

All of my close friends are married or in committed relationships. I am in no way resentful of this-trust me here. I’m also the only one in my family who is single. I have always been someone who enjoys commitment. But I don’t want my happiness to rely on being with another person. 

My friends and family suggest I find things to make me happy or to keep me busy. I don’t know where to start. I live right near Chicago, if anyone has suggestions. 

The worst thing is that I know what I should be doing or how I should feel, but I can’t quite get there. I wake up feeling down and I have to talk myself into a place to tell myself everything will ultimately get better. I don’t know what I can do to help myself.

39,"I just posted this in the psychiatry forum, but I realize now that this subreddit is probably a better fit. Sincere apologies if it's a little bit unclear or hard to follow:

I'm not sure if I'm in the right forum, but I'm searching for information about psychiatric drugs which cause the patient to talk to themself. Specifically Adderal, Modafinil, Methylphenidate and similar medications, which somehow disconnect speech centers from voluntary control. And I apologize if my question is unclear. It seems to me that if the speech centers alone are targeted or stimulated, that these sorts of stimulants lead to genuine madness, owing to the patient actually listening to their voices rather than controlling their speech. In other words, if some sort of reflex triggers uncontrollable muttering independent of conscious control, the patient's train of thought can become directed by these spasms or impulses. It's terrifying to think that a drug could deliberately target these areas of the brain with an extreme overload of energy, or some sort of hyper-caffeinated stimulation, while at the same time having little or no effect on any other area of the brain. This has happened to me personally with both Adderall and Modafinil, and it's a side-effect I haven't found mentioned in any of the studies I've been able to find through PubMed. I'm extremely curious whether any psychiatrists have heard of this happening. Can a drug stimulate only speech areas of the brain while doing precisely nothing to any other area of the brain? It's a terrifying experience, and I'm wondering whether this specific psychosis even has a name. I want to underline that I'm not seeking any kind of medical advice, but rather I'm wondering whether anyone has ever heard of this before? Thanks


And I'm also wondering if anyone knows how often psychiatrists personally sample the drugs they prescribe? For instance, in my opinion a longterm and open-ended prescription for Adderall *cannot possibly have a happy ending.* Surely psychiatrists must know this? Because the difference between me with a giant prescription bottle of pure amphetamine (aka Adderall) and a methhead talking to himself while sifting through a garbage can isn't necessarily that great. I don't have to mug people or go car-hopping in the middle of the night, so criminality-wise we're quite different, but we both share the experience of being high during our day-to-day lives. And actually, I'm likely taking *way more* than the average meth user. Yet somehow the term ""speed freak"" isn't generally used to describe functional people. Also, at this point, the drug seems to have fried my mind *at least* as much as any psycho roaming the streets, so these distinctions are becoming almost completely meaningless to me.....",19Nov2017,0

All started 2 years ago when some pretty messed up stuff happened with me and my now ex and some other bad shit also including an interesting hospital visit. 

Anyway I don't know whether I should go and see my doctor and get him to book me in for a psychiatrist. Basically this has been happening to me:


My moods fluctuate throughout the day, I go from being on top of the world to being at the bottom of hell. 


I hear (my) phone ring. But it's my old phone I always here (iphone) I have a samsung now.


I hear my friends shouting me when they're not 


I sometimes think that someone is going to jump me or mug me when I'm going to meet them.


I've had a couple accounts of looking at someone and seeing their face on the side of their head. (their ear takes the shape of their face)


My vision is always looking weird and kind of shifts around a bit


I always find meaning in numbers and random events throughout the day 


I feel like no one else around me is like me, like i'm a god sent to earth


I sometimes feel like people can hear my thoughts 


I sometimes feel like people can see through my eyes and can access my thoughts and emotions


I recently saw what looked like a shadow stood up in the dark, I put up my phone light and there was nothing. (felt like it was following me)


Mistook a piece of fabric on a lamppost in the distance as someone waving at me


All my emotions feel mixed up I don't really show emotion and when I do i'm sometimes blunt, awkward or sarcastic


I get really really agitated sometimes 


I feel so disconnected to everyone I always used to help people and empathize with them...now I'd just listen to them and feel emotionless. 


I'm tired and I don't know what to do anymore I just want to be normal again but everyday has it's own thing that wants to fuck with me. 


I'm disconnected from everything, from everyone, I don't know what's in my mind or what's even happening anymore.

45,"Hello guys. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a few years ago. Ever since, my life has had ups and downs but I can say I'm on the edge most of the time. Lately, I have been pretty down and I've felt constantly anxious. But there's something that worries me even more. I am a music junkie. I breathe music. Music has been my only friend when I had no one. I listen to a variety of music, even though I like rock/metal the most. For the past 3-4 months, I have been slowly losing my passion for music, and it kills me. Music used to be my medicine. Nowadays, simply seeing my playlist gives me anxiety. When I try to listen to a song, my anxiety goes crazy. Sometimes I'll force myself to listen to my favorite songs, but I always end up feeling like I'd rather not listen to music anymore. I thought the genre was an issue, so I started to search for different music. After weeks of trying out new music, the result was the same: no matter what band or music genre I try to listen to, all music makes me anxious, nervous, and I pretty much hate the way it makes me feel.

Also, there's something SUPER CREEPY happening to my brain when I listen to old songs. This doesn't happen with newly discovered music, it only happens with old songs. If I try to listen to a song that I really used to like, my brain basically acts like it doesn't recognize the song, which is IRONIC, because that particular song defined a whole era in my life. For instance, when I hear the intro, my brain doesn't associate it with something that I've previously heard, I get a feeling of NOT being familiar with the song (again, ironic, since I've basically listened to that song for about 500 times). Other times, I will listen to a song and somewhat like it, I can recognize the good parts of the song, I can recognize what I LIKE about the song, and I EVEN GET CHILLS of pleasure while listening to it. However, the emotion, the feeling is missing. There is no memory attached to the song, there's nothing that indicates to my brain that I used to like that song in the past as well. So, most of the time I can't enjoy music at all, sometimes I can even HATE the sound of it. Other times, I can recognize the quality of the music, but I don't have any memory of ever listening to it. For instance, when we listen to a song, our brain associates it with a certain feeling. When you listen to a slow, calm song, your brain might associate it with a feeling of melancholy or nostalgia. I used to have a certain feeling associated with EVERY song in my playlist. I used to have songs that made me feel happy, sad, excited, energetic, melancholic, angry, etc. Now all these feelings associated with the songs are gone. I can hear when a song feels good to my ears but I don't feel any kind of emotion attached to it. Sometimes I don't even remember anything about songs that used to be so familiar to me. When I listen to NEW songs, songs that I have never heard in my life, I get confused. I can listen to them for a hundred of times and I still won't know whether I like them or not. I have confusing feelings and I can't pinpoint whether I like a song or not, so I just leave it because of my indecision and never listen to it again.

Anyone else here who feels the same way? I am basically desperate, I am on the verge of crying. I am losing my biggest passion in life, my music. I don't know why I feel this way or what to do. I don't know whether this is anxiety-related or not but I suppose it is, that's what my intuition tells me. Any help guys? I really need advice. It's killing me.",19Nov2017,1
46,"Hello readers,

This gone March, I lost a girlfriend of about 6 months (give or take) to suicide. Drug overdose, to be specific. I have recently, as in the last few days fallen for someone else. By the looks of it, it's requited, and in all honesty, she is *way* more in my league than my girlfriend who passed away.

However, I seem to feel an overwhelming amount of sadness, and self-frustration. I've fallen in love with someone who is more or less perfect for me - people in the drama class (where we in fact met) have even started calling us Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum. Isn't this supposed to be a good thing?

Do you think this is a part of me grieving over the (rather dramatic) end to my last relationship?

I did get formally diagnosed with depression by the Tavistock and Portman (a major therapy centre in North London) when I was 12, so could it be part of that?

Is this common for people with depression, and/or people who have lost a partner? Please, do tell.

Thanks,
Carol.

PS - A little bit of sentimentality that I thought I might leave - me and my previous girlfriend's ""song"". It's Everything But The Girl's ""The Only Living Boy In New York"". I listened to this on repeat after her death. Absolutely wonderful cover of an already fantastic song.

47,"Hello.

So I'm not entirely sure what my purpose for creating this post is. I've just been grappling with a problem for some time now and I'm having a lot of trouble making a decision.

Real quick background info. I've been struggling with depression since I was eight (I'm 24F) and I saw therapists on and off throughout childhood and once or twice in my teens years (didn't trust or like therapists so I mostly refused to see them back then). I was put on Prozac a while ago during my teen years and it made things exponentially worse. Things had gone from barely manageable to 10x harder to deal with. I stay on them for only a short amount of time before I made the decision to stop them entirely.

Now, things are starting to get unbearable for me again. Everywhere I look it seems like my life is completely falling apart, and aside from a few years in my teenage days, this is probably the most hopeless and miserable I've felt in my life. My current therapist suggests that I try taking antidepressants again but I'm afraid to after the last time I took them. Things are so bad right now I'm certain that I just could not handle it if things got even slightly worse.

Beyond that, I'm afraid that if the Antidepressants _do_ work then I'll look at/use them as the solution to my problems rather than an intermediary step towards full recovery.

I'm sure my thinking is stupid, but I can't seem to convince myself otherwise. Of course, I think I just don't want to go down that road so badly that I'm not allowing myself to see the good side of this option.

Anyone have any thoughts/opinions or had a similar experience to me? I feel so damn stuck and I'm getting to the end of my rope here.",19Nov2017,1

While I love the cloud of depression being gone, and I can actually enjoy life again, I'm sitting on this couch being tortured by completely ridiculous thoughts that I can't shut off.  At least when I'm depressed, I'm free of that.  I'm not sure which I hate worse.",19Nov2017,0

I became a writer in college but... I feel like my emotional overreactions to things are the reason I have writers block because my feelings are so strong I push away creative projects that trigger my emotions. I literally won’t watch movies because they make me too sad or angry.

I wanted to watch Lady Bird this weekend but I said I couldn’t because it’s so powerful from the trailer I will feel this energy well up inside me and I’ll get so inspired and worried about my own life I won’t sleep for two days straight.
