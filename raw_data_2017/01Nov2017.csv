0,"I was groomed as a young child, it went on for many years due to this person being friends with my parents. 

I remember a lot about the grooming, and some 'minor' (innocent looking) things. 
I cant shake the feeling that something else happened. 
My mind takes me to a room and i dont know if i have made it up or not. 
It is just a room. It doesnt seem to go any further than being just that, but i dont understand why because i dont remember being in a room. 

I dont know if its a memory i have blocked, or if its just due to me thinking more happened. 

Someone has spoken to me today about grooming and its brought it all to the front of my mind again. 

Could i be blocking things? How do I unblock if i am? I am 31 now and it still all really gets to me. 

The last contact i had with this person was when i was 13. So it has been a long time",01Nov2017,1
1,"Hi can anyone give me any advice? I was having sex with my sex partner and the condom broke during climax. Not to sound vulgar, but she was basically filled and I really want to cry for several reasons. 

We ran out and bought the Plan B One Step pill and she took it two hours after. She had just gotten off her period 3 days ago and we had sex yesterday when this occurred. Everyone keeps saying things will be fine, but I really want to cry. 
We are both 18 and I can't imagine putting her through such a stressful situation when she already has home problems and stuff.

I know I can't do much, but I really just wanted to type this somewhere and have some company for the next 2-3 weeks until she hopefully (I really hope so) gets her period.

I'm so sad and stressed, but I appreciate you guys and have no one else to tell or go to. I had very bad anxiety two years ago and it's coming back at full force right now. I've already missed one day of classes because mentally I can't take it. I'm dying and I know it has 95% of working with her also just getting off her period the chances are very slim, but I'm dying right now. I can't do it.

2,"Hello, let me start off by saying something's wrong with head, let me explain. I've been planning on murdering someone like a random person, this will come into thought almost every second of the day. I guess it's hard to explain but sometimes with out knowing it I'll pack my bag with my axe or hachet or my knife and other things, or I'll have detailed plans on where to wait for someone to walk by. And the worst thing is that this is making sense to me more and more every day, what should I do? I'm getting a therapist, but I'm not planning shoot up a school, it's like ambushing type of murder I don't know what to do, I'm at a lost",01Nov2017,1
3,"This past month has been pretty stressful for me.  I’m in high school and all of the work during the day and homework the second I get home  is causing me great stress, little time for  relaxation, and a reoccurring feeling of mental exhaustion. Feeling good is  something I’ve been struggling with a lot lately.  Ive been feeling generally  happy during the day as I have a supportive and great friends  and  I feel pretty productive and on top of my work. However, when I get home I break down in tears and feel pretty bad. It either goes that way or I break down in school and are fine at home. I would be able to accept breaking down at home and not at school, but I’m tired of being sad around my family.  I feel like I’m happy during the day but then I become overwhelmed with sadness-it’s effecting me physically(I’ve lost my appetite and the desire to shower)? So anyways are you supposed to have certain times in a day that you feel sad, so it doesn’t build up and cause an overwhelming sense of sadness? Or is it possible to feel happy all of the time?",01Nov2017,3

5,"Long story short, self harm cut on my inner ankle, about 2 inches long about 4 days old.  Every time I've done this in my life, it has completely healed in a few days and scars fade fairly fast  (it's never too deep)

I did one about 4 days ago, and it's just gotten more and more painful every day.  It looks welted up and irritated along the entire thing but no puss or anything too gross looking.  I've been keeping a bandage over it, but even with that, just my pant leg brushing against it is causing horrible pain.

I don't want to go to the doctor, mostly just because it seems dumb to go for a small cut, but I don't know at what point I should be worried.  It doesn't look infected as far as what I'm seeing online, but it's SO painful.",01Nov2017,1

7,"I should mention over the summer, I got rejected from lots of colleges. I had above 3.5 (unweighted) GPA with only AP classes and a 1500/1600 on the SAT. I was smart but it took the whole summer for me to accept that I'm just an underdeveloped, boring person (from the viewpoint of an admission officer). Drank waaaay more than was healthy. Like 3 gallons over two months (6 ft, 220 lbs so I have a medium baseline tolerance). It wasn't that I was addicted to alcohol, but that I was using it to escape the feels that I sucked. Once I decided to get over that, stopping drinking was super easy. 

I'm now a freshman in college, week 6 or 7. Before high school ended, it felt like I was an active participant in my life and I had passions and goals. Friendships felt meaningful and life was vibrant and full of emotion. Nowadays, I feel like I don't care. I'm not sad, or even bummed that I don't care. I just kinda drift through time, and while I'm working hard to achieve my goals it doesn't feel important. When old friends (HS friends who go to college with me) come to me with legit problems, I give them the best advice I can and help them through it, but I honestly don't care. I would never block them out, but ifIi went a month without talking to them I probably wouldn't even notice. Overall, emotions are pretty flat and unimpactful to my life, and it's like someone wrapped a speaker with fabric (muted). I don't really feel connections to people anymore, there's just those close to me (physically) and those who aren't. Is this just hormones calming down from angsty teen years or should I do something?

TL;DR I feel emotionally disconnected in comparison to previous years. Not sad, just apathetic. Going through the motions. Is this adult life or bad vibes man?",01Nov2017,3

9,"I just moved across the country for my dream job in my dream town. I love my job even though its stressful, like today when it seemed like everything just fell on me at once. I've been on the job going on 3 weeks now. 

However, in order to take this job, I had to leave my child behind with my parents temporarily until I could find suitable housing for us both. The plan is to have a two bedroom apartment by Christmas. It doesn't help that my town is undergoing a housing crisis as well so finding a permanent place is difficult to say the least. Right now, I'm staying in a one bedroom apartment near work, which isn't bad.

However, I think my meds need to be readjusted, but my insurance hasn't kicked in yet. I also have spent the majority of the evening in a state of panic to the point of getting side stitches from shallow, rapid, breathing. Currently, I'm taking 5 pills a day to stay on an even keel.

I work with college students who have disabilities, many of whom have mental illness. There's a community mental health center, but this place is pretty small, so I feel like it's a fish bowl effect in a sense and I don't want my students seeing me at the mental health center because I don't want them getting the wrong idea.

With work, I have a couple of students that I'm really worried about and it's stressing me out. Especially one who is a difficult case because I have done everything I can to try and help them, but I feel like I'm in a corner because of an overly involved parent. 

It's been a rough day and I don't mean to carry on. I just don't feel right talking to my boss about this as I've just started and I don't want to be perceived as a weak link in the office. This has been my goal for years and I don't want anything to ruin it, especially my mental health issues. Maybe I'm just stressing for no reason and I just need to suck it up?

11,"I'm interested to hear peoples' perspectives on how they've approached life when they know their mental health is an issue but it's not clear cut as to what the issue is exactly. 

Long story short, I got diagnosed with ADHD last year after years of struggles with chronic procrastination to do with university. Initially this came as good news to me because now at least I had a reason for what was happening and a framework that I could work with to tackle the problems. Then the medication didn't really have much of an effect. Then I moved cities and went to see a new psychiatrist who was doubtful about the initial ADHD diagnosis. Some of my symptoms are indicative of depression which led my new psychiatrist to prescribe me anti-depressants which are also used to treat ADHD in some cases. These don't really seem to do much either. 

Another psychologist that I saw had another opinion again. I just get frustrated with not having a clear approach to address my own mental health. I read stuff about ADHD and it resonates... stuff about depression also resonates... stuff about simple behavioural conditioning and short-term gratification also makes sense. And it seems like all of these perspectives are relevant but none of them are 'acute' enough (e.g. I'm not suicidal, which I'm thankful for) to warrant a clear way forward - and yet the effect it has on my life seems to be significant. Anybody got any thoughts? 

Many thanks. Also I'm from Australia if that's relevant. ",01Nov2017,2
12,"Okay. So I'm new to this forum but I am officially desperate.
So I'll start with my symptoms to like... easily explain.

I have intense violent intrusive thoughts and have since the day my son Is born. I cry at least once a day and that's a good day. I tried to beg my husband to let me put my baby up for adoption. I planned and sorted a baby sitter so i could divorce my husband and give him the baby because I'm afraid I'm a bad mom. I had to cut all my hair off because I let it mat so bad all a hair dresser could do was shave it. I sleep two hours a night for fear of falling asleep feeding the baby during might feeds. I'm incredibly irritable to the point I yelled at a baby. I can't be alone I get horribly paranoid when I'm alone that someone will come harm the baby. I had to call the emergency line at my husband's work because I lost it so bad one night. I've been having mild hallucinations but I have delt with this in the past and was prescribed an antipsychotic for it that I quit because I gained a lot of weight on it.

So here is my issue. I told my ob like I was told to do in the hospital after giving birth. My ob said he didn't want me to do anything until I was a danger to my self or the baby.

Then I started getting real crazy and made an emergency appointment with a professional.

My mom told me to get a grip so canceled.

I tried to reschedule but they were booked until late December

So I found another location.

My appointment went very bad.

The woman told me to sleep more and to deal with my fear of sleep to ""Put baby in its bed. If you fall asleep with them you could kill them."" 

She told me the solution is to make more friends and get more sleep and these are things I try to do but struggle with

She started telling me breast feeding would help lose weight (i never said anything about worrying about my weight and I think I'm just fine) like guilting me after I told her I could not breast feed and am dealing with issues becaus3 of it. (I managed to convience convince myself my breast milk was poison after feeding vaby once so I just used a breast pump but threw the milk away every time. )

She started trying to push her religion on me when I told her I am firmly not religious.

And she pretty much told me to do all the things I struggle with like sleeping and leaving the house as if it's just perfectly easy to just do these things and mainly focused on me being shy being the problem.

She told me to deal with my violent intrusive thoughts by thinking  about cute stuff like puppies. No fucking joke.

And although her location can prescribe medications and I told her my ob refuses to allow me to get any help until it's serious she told me I should ask my ob for antidepressants.

I've been suicidal before I've been put away for it and I can feel things are escalating. Any suggestions? I'm taking supplements and I'm using essential oils and started keeping a journal and I've tried going out and I've tried doing my make up and dressing myself.

And I still spend entire days in bed sobbing because I'm a fuck up.

But I'm fearing that it is all in my head that it's just me being an attention seeker or a hypochondriac like maybe I'm just being dramatic. I had a professional tell me once long ago after my real mom died and my adopted dad died and a family member violently sexually assaulted me several times that I'm fine and I'm being over dramatic and like... is this normal? Am I normal and just a shit person? I'm just so confused and mad at doctors a d mad at myself and confused. I do love my baby but I just desperately want to be away from him so someone better can care fo4 him. Idk what I want. I just want help. Btw I'm in America ",01Nov2017,4

15,"I just hope someone reads this I've never given this information to anyone before.

I'm 23, I have no friends, I haven't had friends for almost 10 years and I haven't spoken to anyone outside work/family since high school. I spend all my free time alone listening to music I shouldn't like. I feel like I don't exist until I realize I do - then reality sets in. I'm alone. I'll always be alone. I've never so much as touched another girl never mind a relationship, and I've come to terms with the fact that I probably never will.

Any friendship I've ever had was forced. With someone I did not like (and in one case one that hurt me for years). I've never experienced a true friendship. 

It's always been just a fact of my life that I forgot about. Drown the reality in music... games... no matter what really, I just forgot. Didn't care. But recently the reality has set in and it is absolutely terrifying. 

I see people at school talking to friends... people... while I walk alone. 

The scariest part is knowing there is no path to success. There is nothing I can do to fix any of it. There is nothing I will do. I've felt this way for as long as I can remember. I am so afraid that I will grow old alone. With no friends, no love to ever speak of. Just me. and me alone. as it has always been. i fear it will happen because it is likely. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know that I'm asking for advice or for someone to just read this or maybe both i don't know I just needed to write this. i've never done anything like this before in my life.

16,"So I think my boyfriend is depressed.. he just doesn't seem like himself lately. I know he's gone through phases of depression before because he kind of mentioned them. I know how hard it can be and I know that it's hard to talk about and it seems like nobody notices so I want him to know that I notice and I care. 

Any advice on how to bring this up to him without sounding like I'm accusing him of something? We cuddle a lot and he'll lay on me while I pet his head so I was thinking maybe I should wait until that time and then just ask him ""Is everything okay with you lately?"" and I'm sure he's going to respond ""yes why"" and then I'll say something like ""you kind of just don't seem like yourself lately."" and if he asks how then I'll just tell him that I notice he never wants to go out and he doesn't eat healthy or exercise and he stays up all night and he always feels sick.. 

I don't know if this sounds like I'm accusing him of being lazy or something though. And if he does admit that he's depressed or something else then how should I respond to help him? I know I can't cure it and I can just be there for him, but should I suggest we start working out together or something like that? maybe that would be a start to him feeling better?",01Nov2017,6

25,"Eight years later, I'm not over it.

The police came to my door based on anonymous hearsay. I refused to answer their questions about whether I was suicidal, as I believed one has the right to remain silent in this country. They took my silence as evidence that I should be taken to the hospital and be evaluated for ""thought crime"". This did not meet the definition of probable cause and there was zero due process, but nobody cared but me.

I told them I wasn't going and that they had no evidence against me, and sat in a chair. A police officer, male and twice my size, came up to me while I was sitting in the chair, grabbed my arm, and attempted to drag me across the room by my arm. It took me years to realize that this was police brutality. There were no witnesses and no video, and nobody cared.

I punched him in the chest several times to try to get him off me, because I was a woman being grabbed roughly by the arm and dragged bodily by a man twice my size when I did nothing wrong, and he was hurting me. I was tackled onto a bed, had multiple men twice my size lying on top of me while handcuffing me, not caring while I told them I couldn't breathe (when I saw the video of Eric Garner being murdered it gave me flashbacks to that time). I tried to reposition myself so I could breathe. They shouted that they would tase me if I continued to move.

Then I was dragged out in handcuffs in front of all my dorm mates. I had not been charged with any crime or read my rights, yet I was handcuffed.

This is ""help.""

I was transported in an ambulance that they later charged me $900 for (good thing I had health insurance) even though I had not consented to medical treatment and there was no due process beyond a one-minute evaluation by an EMT to determine whether I deserved to have civil rights or not.

When I got to the hospital I was tied to a bed, because I was determined to be ""a danger to others"" based on the fact that I defended myself from an unprovoked physical assault from an armed man twice my size.

They decided to take a blood sample from me without my consent. I dislike needles. When I reacted with fear at the thought of having blood drawn, and started crying because I was so upset with the situation, I was screamed at and told that they would sedate me until I was unconscious without my consent if I didn't shut up. Since I was already tied to a bed and immobilized, clearly they were acting this way just to exert power over me and violate me even more, not because they actually had to.

I'm not sure you can understand how absolutely violating on every level it is to be immobilized and trapped, to be subjugated into a being with zero autonomy, a being who is screamed at and called ""insane"" and ""noncompliant"" (they literally use that word for it!) any time autonomy is expressed, when you know that you have done nothing but defend the civil rights you have always been told are inalienable, when you know that nothing remotely resembling due process has happened here, when you know that you did not raise your hand first here, when you know that no charges have been filed in a court of law, yet you're being treated like a violent and irredeemable criminal of the worst order. Even many murderers are allowed far more autonomy on their first day being arrested than I was allowed.

They told me that it would be a lot better for me if I signed the papers to be voluntarily committed, so I signed them even though I didn't want to. Later I found out that they had signed me in as ""involuntarily committed"" anyway because ""I was upset and crying when I signed the papers."" This means that I will never be able to own a gun (not that I want to, but still, it is a Constitutional right) or hold down certain jobs because an involuntary commitment is now on my record. This happened with zero due process or burden of proof.

As I was walked into the mental ward, I was crying, because of the complete loss of any dignity I had left along with being stripped of my civil rights in the matter of a couple of hours. A nurse told me that ""If you want any hope of getting out of here anytime soon, you'd better stop 'acting crazy' right now.""

This is ""help.""

I was told that if I wanted to be released, I had to convince the doctors and nurses that I was ""not a danger to myself or others."" This sounds good enough on the surface, except the rest of my stay revealed that they didn't care how I actually felt. What they cared about was compliance. I was told that if I wanted to be released, I had to demonstrate obedience by going to all the therapy sessions and doing all the activities. Despite the fact that such participation really had nothing to do with whether I was suicidal or not. I was also told that another way I could ""demonstrate compliance"" was by going on psychotropic medication. This I refused (the dangers of SSRIs are a whole other post) as I had seen enough of them even at that age to know they were dangerous. The nurses treated me like a cross between a murderer and a toddler the entire time, but I wasn't allowed to be annoyed by that either.

I was restricted to a couple of 5-minute calls a day and told that I could not have access to my cellphone to get anyone's number. Hey, don't people say that the support of loved ones is important to mental health and recovery? Why do YOU think phone calls to such people would be limited then? Forget about having any type of access at all to a lawyer. Mass murderers and child rapists have the right to an attorney after they are arrested and imprisoned, but did I? Nope!

Once a day, the ward psychiatrist came by. You could ask to get a 10-minute evaluation from him, after which he would determine how you were progressing and if you were allowed to be released. Yes, that's right. Patients were only evaluated by an actual doctor for up to ten minutes a day. The rest of the time, it was all nurses.

On the first day, I asked to see the psychiatrist. The appointment was made but he didn't actually show up until almost two hours later. That's how it always went in the mental ward. Whenever you had an appointment to do something, it always ended up being pushed back by 1-2 hours. Although I have no real proof for this, I always thought that this was a test to see if the patients would flip out or not, because if they did flip out, that was ""proof"" that they were ""crazy"" and would have to stay. I asked the other patients what they thought of it and they agreed.

So finally the psychiatrist showed up. I told him that I was not a danger to myself or others and that I would like to be released. He looked over the papers, talked to me for about one minute, and then said he wasn't going to release me today. I told him that I was disappointed, as I had been complying with all the orders to the letter for almost 24 hours, and asked him how he could possibly get any type of adequate assessment based on talking to me for literally one minute. He then said to me, and I quote, ""Your attitude sucks.""

I said something along the lines of, ""Wow. That's very professional of you. Would you make that type of statement to any patient other than a mental patient? Or do you think it's ok to act in a rude and unprofessional way to ""crazy"" people? Where did you get your MD, clown college?""

And he literally just got up and walked away without another word.
This is ""help.""

For the next day, I told EVERYONE, nurses, patients, literally anyone who I interacted with, what the doctor had said to me and how unprofessional he was. All of them, even the nurses, agreed that he was out of line. The next day, he actually asked to see me before all the other patients. His attitude had done a complete 180 and he seemed meek. He apologized, he told me he was sorry we had ""got off on the wrong foot"" the day before, and he said that he had decided to release me that day. Did he evaluate me to see if I actually was a danger to myself or others? No. Did he do any type of psychological assessment on me in the entire time there? No. Did he talk to me for any more than a grand total of two minutes the entire time? No. He decided to release me purely because I made him look bad in front of his patients and subordinates. A few hours later (of course, 1-2 hours later than the time they said it would happen) I was released, after having been in there less than two days.

But do you want to know the kicker?

I was actually MORE SUICIDAL WHEN I LEFT THAN WHEN I WENT IN. Yeah. Turns out that being physically and emotionally brutalized and stripped of every last bit of self-esteem and dignity from the very people who are supposed to help, while being imprisoned indefinitely in a bleak and depressing environment with other ""crazy"" people including people in active psychosis, tends to make people suicidal. But I sure as hell couldn't tell anyone! I still am not entirely sure how I survived the rest of the semester. I believe the only reason why I survived is because I was too much of a pussy to actually go through with killing myself (and again, that's yet another irony, that it's highly unlikely I ever would have killed myself anyway due to my lack of any sort of courage or determination).

This is ""help.""

My original plan was to kill myself as soon as I got out, but I was too much of a pussy to go through with it, especially if I got caught and imprisoned again. I made my best attempt to return to ""normal life"" despite the fact that my depression and anxiety were even worse than they had been. About a week later, the cops showed up at my door again. I knew it was them from the authoritative knock on the door. I didn't want to answer it, but I was afraid they would knock the door down and assault me again if I didn't, so I answered. They were charging me, thankfully not in an actual court of law but in the school's kangaroo court, with assault and disorderly conduct. I was being punished for fighting off an attack, for acting like I deserved to have basic civil rights, and of course, for ""thought crime"".

Over the next couple of months, I went through the BS ""legal process"" (BTW why the hell are colleges allowed to function as an independent legal system? WTF?) and they gave me good news: the school was so beneficent, they had decided they weren't going to suspend or expel me, but instead put me on ""disciplinary probation."" I was told that I should be happy about this, and that it was a second chance. Yay, a second chance to go to a corrupt school that I never wanted to go to in the first place, even before they condoned my assault and violation, and only went to because the alternative was being kicked out on the street with no money by my biological mother. I was told as a condition of my disciplinary probation that I had to go to one of the school's therapists. I actually tried to make the most of it and straight-up asked the therapist if she would help me find tangible solutions to any of the problems that I was facing that made me depressed in the first place, but she was more interested in trying to push psychotropic medication on me and trying to get me to believe that I was at fault for defending myself against the cop. At the end of the semester she retired and the school decided they didn't have the resources to give me another therapist.

This is ""help.""

For some reason (I will never understand this), instead of finding the courage to take control of my life, I put up with that BS for another three years, graduated, and made some attempt to move on with the shell that was left of me as a person. Before the violation, I had never been a huge fan of my school, but after it, I actively hated it. When there were several high-profile suicides on campus and the school's best response was to put up smiley faces all over campus with messages such as ""You are loved!""; when I learned that there were so many mentally ill students on campus that not only were all the school therapists booked, but so were all the therapists in town; basically any time in the past eight years when I have ever read anything referring to involuntary hospitalization, the dangers of SSRIs, or (the most enraging thing of all) seen someone tell someone else to ""get help""; I felt complete anger.

I realized almost eight years later how much this still affects me to this day. I live on the edges of other peoples' lives. I isolate myself for long periods of time and find it hard to make close relationships or trust people. Although I did have such tendencies even before this incident, I do feel that this incident cemented it. I spent much of the rest of my college career trying to stay off the radar and trying to have as little involvement with my school as possible. While I was a straight-A student for most of my academic career, I now find it hard to concentrate at all. People always ask me when I'm going to get a job and the truth is, I don't know. Unfortunately, I have come to realize that my brain has made a sort of Pavlovian association between working hard and being abused and mistreated. Furthermore, anytime I apply to a job, especially if it requires a background check, I feel an overwhelming anxiety at the thought that someone is going to find out that I was involuntarily hospitalized and I will never be hired again. This is definitely an irrational fear, but it's still there. Normally the response to such mental health concerns would be ""get therapy."" But who am I supposed to get therapy from, when the therapists are the ones that caused this?

This is ""help.""

People wonder why I support antipsychiatry. Why I never followed through with therapy successfully. I tried several times over the years, but always quit after several sessions. How can I ever trust one of them again when they're all complicit with a system that strips people of their civil rights without any due process, and violates them physically and emotionally, all under a guise of ""help"" that the rest of society readily agrees with? Any of them would allow me to be brutalized again and see absolutely nothing wrong with it. I was physically and emotionally abused for two decades by a family member, up to and including that person trying to kill me, and I still consider this to be the most traumatizing experience of my life.

Some people out there probably think I am insane, that I am overreacting, or even that I am lying. I myself thought that I might be overreacting, that maybe I had misremembered, until I looked it up recently and found many people with stories that were exactly the same. I found studies stating that the majority of people reported having had a traumatic experience when hospitalized for mental health concerns. The general public doesn't know about this and quite frankly doesn't give a fuck, because they think this is a necessary evil. They think this is a good thing in the long run. They call this ""getting help.""

This is ""help.""

Fuck Cayuga Medical Center, a pathetic excuse for a hospital that thinks hurting=treating.

Fuck Cornell University, a school that cares about nothing but money, that nods and smiles while students are brutalized and then wonders why there are so many cases of mental illness and suicide among their students (they do a lot more fucked up shit than that, but that's the topic of a whole other post).

Fuck my biological mother, whose response to me being hospitalized was to scream at me for ""causing drama"" and ""jeopardizing my education,"" then called me up screaming when the $900 ambulance bill came (even though insurance ended up covering it) and for months afterward referred to it as a ""stunt that I pulled for attention."" That's far from the only reason why I am estranged from her, but it's definitely on the top 10 of reasons why.

I will not stay silent anymore on what they did to me.

And the next time you or someone else tell someone who is struggling to ""get help,"" just remember:

This is ""help.""",01Nov2017,49
26,"I'm a woman in my early 20s and for last couple of years I found that I can be pretty emotionally volatile during PMS (which I see is a natural thing). However I started take more notice of my emotions and I realized I actually cry every month - usually within 7 days prior to getting my period. 

Like I said, I've been telling myself it's normal to feel anger and sadness easily during PMS, however it's the degree I feel them that concerns me. I am not sure if my level of emotions felt is more than average. 

Example:
I was on the bus with backpack and both hands full of groceries. I was getting off after 3 stops so I didn't want to move too far from the door. I was lazy to take off my backpack since both my hands were full from groceries. I pivoted my body so my backpack isn't in the way of ppl passing by but a lady told me to take off my backpack. Afterwards I kept feeling guilty about it, thinking I'm an awful person that I knew I should have took off my backpack but I didn't. I was shaken up a little and even shed a few tears - not actual crying though. I do have a passive death wish, so things like these make me think about I'm better dead since I'm not that great of a person. However I do not think about ways to end my own life or desire to do so... just wishing I was dead. 

Can I get some insight on this? Sometimes I suspect I might be depressed or anxious but I don't think I experience bad ones for over 2 weeks straight. I never got checked out by a professional because I feel like it's not serious enough for me to go on meds anyways and therapists aren't always helpful and can be expensive. I would like to hear what people have to say about how I internalize things easily, blaming myself for little things. I don't feel like this all the time, but more so during PMS or when life gets a bit overwhelming. ",01Nov2017,1

29,"**TLDR: I have an 8 sibling y/o that seems to be suffering from some sort of anxiety related to school. I need advice on the best form of treatment/therapy for him and how to find it.**

My brother was fine until September of this year. He was held back in 3rd grade, parents decided to enroll him an a private catholic school as a 4th grader. He has poor social skills to begin with as he rarely makes eye contact, behaves extremely timid outside of the house, and does not have many friends. 

Transitioning to a new school disturbed him mentally. He goes to the new school and complains of “headaches” to the teacher while in class the first day, gets sent to the nurse’s office where he starts crying. He seemed really depressed and dreaded the idea of going to school the next 3 days, making every excuse he could have to avoid school. 

In response, we decided to put him back in his old school as 3rd grader. We thought that bringing him back to a familiar environment would help him. But now, all of his old classmates are in the 4th grade and he must be feeling like the odd one out in his new class. The “headaches” continue and he bursts out crying in class one of the first days back. 

Now at home he complains about the headaches often. He says the are momentary and go away on their own. He will also say that his legs hurt, he feels like his heart is beating fast, he has a high temperature, he feels like throwing up, he arm feeling weird, etc. This has gone on for a few weeks now. He is now very anxious about everything. He seems more and more dreadful about school and it is heart breaking. 

We took him to a an outpatient clinic at our local hospital, Trinitas in Elizabeth, NJ. We detailed his situation to the social worker. She recommended a 12 week program of a Social skill group therapy. I was going through the hospitals pamphlets and that seemed to be the only option for treatment offered there unless it was a very severe case requiring one on one  psychiatric evaluation. 

I would like to explore other treatment options as my gut feeling is telling me that the social skills group sessions are not the right answer for him at this stage. We are in union county in north NJ. **Can the members of this Subreddit please guide me on options/offer advice. It will be greatly appreciated.**

35,"I saw a general care doctor in hopes that she would refer me to a psych, write me a letter for an esa(she did for my sister), and get me started on medication.

I paid $50 dollars to see a doctor who couldn't hear me. She mostly insisted I should be hospitalized, reluctantly prescribed me medicine that costs over $100 a month, told me I should ""think about my safety plan"", and refused to help me with the esa. 

I explained that I had waited a month to see her and that the only thing getting me through was that I thought I could get an esa. My work had approved me bringing it daily. My apartment gave me paperwork. 

Well, the psych unit won't see me for a month. 
The medication she gave me and insists I need to take, I can't afford. 

I called another behavioral health place, they won't take her referral and want me to go in and get one from them(50 dollars up front) to wait for at least a month to see a psych. And the lady was really rude on the phone, obviously annoyed by my questions and wouldn't give me straight answers the first time. 

I do not want to be hospitalized. 
I will likely lose my job and won't be able to pay for my apartment just by missing that much work alone. 
My last stay in a hospital taught me to lie to doctors to get out sooner.

I've been back to my GP twice, wrote letters explaining how terrible I feel, and calling them almost once a week because I'm becoming desperate. For background, I have not hospitalized/inpatient for my mental health, however, I was housebound under the local crisis team who visit every day and administer medicines and risk level. I was told this was to avoid being admitted and the social implications of such. I was considered at severe risk of self-harm and suicidal actions and they discharged me after about two weeks. I was given a change in my anti-depressant and sent on my way with a referral for psychology and literally nothing else. I've been waiting approximately 5 months to see a psych doctor and had very little else in terms of psychiatric support. I still fully believe I am currently going through a mental breakdown. I'm quite frankly sick and tired of waiting, I don't want to feel like this anymore however I am at a loss of what to do next. I can't afford private therapy sessions (£300 per session I was quoted) and I don't have private medical insurance.

46,"Hey. Posting this here because... well I don't have anywhere else to talk about this stuff.

I've been having trouble with my mental health for the best part of a decade now, starting in my second year of high school and with it drastically worsening my performance at school for the next 2 and a half years (it's a small miracle I didn't drop out; 37% attendance one year but somehow passed all my classes). It's been pretty much a constant in my life since then, I've never felt quite... 'right' again.

In the last few years it's started to get particularly bad. I've been feeling that my life is a complete waste, that I'm inferior to everyone I know, that I'm incapable of doing anything useful or having an enjoyable life, etc. And it's been causing disruption in my performance at college (yay it's almost like being 13/14 again!), so I decided I needed to finally get some help. I posted on here a while ago asking for help and advice and the helpful person who responded (/u/Little_adawg) suggested I do the burns test, in which I scored 70.

Anyway long story short, yesterday I had my doctor's appointment where I went to get some help. Nothing definite is happening yet but the doctor was nice and seemed pretty understanding, asked me some questions about my mental health and my family's mental health history. He didn't necessarily confirm that I have depression but spoke about the different types of treatments available, so... I guess he sort of indirectly confirmed it? He also gave me some documents to look at with links to various websites with information, help and support and stuff. I've been looking over it and... I don't think anything short of medication will work for me.

I'm going to see the doctor again in another 3 weeks, and I think I'm going to ask him if I can just start on medication. I don't want to put it off for much longer because I know that if it does work it'll take a few weeks to start working, and I'm already falling behind pretty badly at college. I really don't want to drop out and be a failure.

I've always struggled and have been in and out of inpatient facilities for the past few years, I've been out one year this past July. Working at my job I feel useful despite still feeling like a burden in everyday life. But lately I've had trouble sleeping and weird things are coming back to me about years I've spent moving around two different towns and different hospitals. Small moments with not-so-lovely people I feel are worming their way back into the front of my mind.

I think it started a few weeks ago when I could feel that something was going to go wrong despite being very productive and Theory day today. I started having more anxiety and more trouble sleeping but at least normal people don't sleep because stress, I've dealt with insomnia for years so after finally finding a sleeping Med this seems close to normal people. If I sleep for a long amount of time I end up having weird dreams that more than a few times have resulted in me waking up in a panic attack.

Also, some may believe they don't have a personality when they actually do have, but this is not the case I wish to discuss. 
My issue is very much real and yet dismissed so easily because most people don't understand how it can be. I've been having this issue for as long as I can remember myself. 
I don't like or hate things. While I claimed for some time, for example, that I like the color green, and then other times that I like black, I actually don't like any color at all. I also don't hate certain colors. I don't like or hate anything, actually. When I watch a movie, I never know whether I liked or hated it. It's just something to do to pass the time. I never really enjoy anything.
Also, I don't have a clear opinion on anything whatsoever. I could agree on something and then disagree instantly, but I would usually agree in order to avoid arguing. I could care less about being right or wrong. 
I don't care about a lot of things. I just pretend that I do. Pretend to be someone... When I'm actually... a nobody. I wasn't even influenced by my surroundings.

It was actually quite nice. I asked my crush out and she said yes, something I would never do.  The happiness only lasted like 2 days though.

Idk how to explain it but it was just crazy. I had trouble sleeping and then I was just about to fall sleep and I heard a voice call my name and that was weird. So I got like 4 and a half hours of sleep but I was still energized.

Then the next day I got super mad at my grandma because she moved my belt and I couldn't find it. It's just not like me to get mad at little things and i'm sitting there telling myself it doesn't matter, but it didn't change it.  

Then the actual bad thing happened. I had what I believe to be a panic attack. It was terrible. I thought I was going insane. I actually texted a few friends that something was wrong with me. Lasted about half an hour. I had a deflated mood after that and I felt tired. 

I had another panic attack today, it was a little better but still awful.

I'm back to normal now but I feel like something came into my body and took over, i'm kind of scared. 

Then last night I couldn't sleep either. I actually had to get up out of my bed. It felt like my thoughts were attacking me and I felt like I was going mad.

I don't want to be diagnosed with anything, what I want is that to never happen again. Cause if that becomes my life I don't want to live. 

This sounds like a rant and it sort of is but goddamn.

I have an appointment today with my psychologist and I plan on telling him most of this but I feel like he'll just think i'm crazy and say it's normal or some shit.

52,"   I cant' pinpoint exactly when it started but for the past number of years Ive been feeling very down.
when I was younger I used to be more social and outgoing and could easily make friends and hold a conversation, but after a prolonged period of loneliness (no idea what caused it) I became more and more isolated to the point where i never went out and lost a lot of friends.

   I'd estimate I missed out on about 3 years of developing social skills. I think it was about 3 years ago that I became aware that I couldn't make friends and even now I don't feel that I can hold a conversation very well.

   About a year ago by some miracle I became friends with people who I had wanted to be friends with since the start of this, but after almost a year I feel they only just tolerate my presence - when we hangout (and we do quite often) i'm usually the quiet one who hardly ever speaks &amp; i can't be my old outgoing self without alcohol for courage.


   For the most part I think we are friends (and there's nothing I want more!) but the smallest misstep and I feel I will lose them. The slightest negative action on their part(not really their fault), whether a few hangout without me or if they tag all the group in online posts except me, fuels this loneliness to the point where I feel worthless and not needed. I've never told any of them this for fear of being treated differently.

  In the past (2+ years ago) i've had days where I genuinely wanted to kill myself, but now I just have overwhelming feelings where I wish I was dead. It's not bad all of the time but there are days where I just feel totally unwanted or that i'm not good enough and that no one would miss me if I was gone, but no real plans to actively end my life.

 I've tried searching online for a possible solution as to whether my problems actually constitute any actual illness but the symptoms for depression, anxiety or personality disorders, I don't feel fit my problems and I don't know whether or not they warrant the need to see a doctor or if i'm just being stupid and need to 'Man up.'

Recently I’ve been eating much less, I’ve been isolating myself from others, which I have done before when I was stressed. I know talking to people would make me feel better yet something is keeping me from it. I’ve been much more irritable lately than I usually am.

Recently I just stare straight ahead instead of doing at my work. Staring at the computer screen or staring at the column in front of me instead of doing my work. 
I lack focus, and it’s not that I an sad or apathetic, it is just I find it increasingly hard to have the willpower to do anything.

I don't know what it would take to get me functioning in society, or if it's even possible. I feel like all they ever do it prescribe medicine and give you ""coping techniques"" then you're off on your own. Obviously, I can't make it on my own in the state I'm in now.

Again, I don't even know what I'm looking for exactly or if it even exists. Maybe I am just doomed.",01Nov2017,1
