0,"So we all know how young kids 'n stuff play pretend? Well, I was an only child who never really had other kids come over to my house. I've always been a creative person, always been very imaginative.

When I was younger, I'd basically single-player pretend that I was in one of the many fantasy universes I liked, and act as the characters.

I'm sixteen now, and I still do this, except I do it with the fictional universes that I create, and mostly do it for fun (only when I'm alone), and act as the characters that I'm creating in the events or stories that I'd like to tell.

I've never had trouble distinguishing that these are fantasies, that they aren't real, and whatnot. I'm just wondering if anyone else does this, if anyone else has had experience with this, or if anyone else knows what I'm talking about.

For more information, I do have a mental disorder--OCD. However these fantasies have never interacted with my disorder, such as something I created becoming an obsession compelling me into a ritual. This is probably because I don't generally think up shit that scares the Hell out of me (like Xenomorphs), and because I'm a very rational person (despite my OCD).

Please, help? Thank you!

1,"Hi everyone. I have struggled with anxiety, depression, and self esteem for many years. I'm finally starting to feel like I'm gaining the strength to deal with these issues. Through personal achievements and martial arts I have worked on developing my confidence. However, being burnt by bad friendships and being taken advantage of in situations has caused me to isolate and not put myself out there at all. I am very afraid of taking risks and getting what I want out of life. I'm so scared of being hurt again after so many times. Does anyone have any advice for slowly coming back from the darkness of mental illness? I would love a nice success story for a little inspiration :) many thanks.",27Jul2017,2

6,"EDIT: I'm not sure why this is tagged as announcement, twas not my intention. Mods, can you help me out?

My SO and I room together with a former coworker of SO. He's recovering from an alcohol addiction, and has been on-again off-again sober for a few months now, but the withdrawal seems to be kicking in hardcore. Lately he's been bouncing from completely shut down and emotionless to irritable, unpredictable and highly emotional, most of those emotions being negative and self loathing. 

My question mainly is what can I be doing in the here and now to help him cope while also keeping my SO and I safe, seeing as he has hit some emotional extremes in the past few days. I don't want to get too far into his history as I am posting this without his knowledge so I'm sorry if I can't give as much information as some would like. 

We are in Canada and I have advised him to get in touch with the Island Health Authority, as they are an awesome resource, but I don't think he'll do so on his own, and I'm largely trying to manage this on my own as SO is remaining relatively detached from the situation, be that for self-preservation reasons or otherwise. 

Any advice or resources to help him out would be greatly appreciated.

7,"My therapist made me sign a safety plan contract thing.. basically saying I won't consume alcohol/partake in illicit drugs, hurt myself, hurt anyone else, purposely put myself in risky situations, things of that nature.

The contract states that if I feel like doing any of the above I will contact an agreed upon list of people close to me (my parents and best friend), and if I am unable to contact them, I will contact my therapist. Or go to the ER, contact one of the mental health hospitals in my area, call the police, etc.

I was wondering if anyone knew what happens if a patient violates a part of a safety contract such as the one I described above. Would my therapist hate me or disown me if I cut myself and didn't contact someone before doing so? I don't want to be locked away in a hospital and I can't afford to do so or to go to an ER or something like that. To take care of yourself means spending lots of money.",27Jul2017,2

9,"This is going to be really long, and I apologize in advance. You definitely do not have to read it, and I don't expect many of you to, however there are some things that I feel as though I need to say. I don’t like to be super personal on here and I most certainly do not like to be emotionally open or vulnerable in any context. I know there are people on here who feel like they are alone and crazy and I just can’t let that go on any longer. This is going to be really tough to write, and I really never wanted to do anything like this, but I guess I'm committed now. 

For as far back as I can remember, I can not recall a single day in which I did not think about killing myself. I could be having the absolute, hands down, bar-none, greatest day of my entire existence and suicide will cross my mind at least a couple of times. I have lived like this for my entire life. 

My mom told me that when I was five I would talk about drowning myself in the bathtub. She said that I wasn’t really sad or angry or upset at all, I would just talk about what it might be like to drown myself in the bathtub. I have no recollection of this, but I do remember always being fascinated by the thought of my own death. 

I am not crazy. I haven’t made any attempts against my life in over a decade. I am of no danger to myself. I am suicidal. I have lived most of my life not knowing when it was that I was finally going to muster up the courage to kill myself, and I would like to provide you with some insight as to what it is like to live like that. 

I assume, and am grateful for the fact that most of you have never even entertained the thought of harming yourself in any manner. In lieu of numerous events that have taken place this year, I have seen a lot of insight and rhetoric from many different people on the subject of suicide, some starkly judgmental, some angry, some empathetic, some apathetic. I promised myself I would stay quite, but I really just can’t. 

I can’t believe that she was so selfish. He had six kids, how could he do such a thing? He was rich and famous, what could have been so bad about his life? Life is hard, suck it up. 

Suck it up. 

Suck it up. 

Suck it up. 

Suck it up. 

Lets talk about depression. Not “my girlfriend and I just broke up and I’m really sad about it,” not “oh man, my parents didn’t buy me the car I wanted and nothing is going my way,” depression. Not “I’ve had a crappy day and nothing is going my way I’m going to be bummed out for the rest of the week so don’t talk to me,” temporary sadness that one can most definitely “suck up,” We are going to get into depression. Real depression. 

Living with depression is living with two voices inside your head, two versions of yourself. There is, of course, you. Fun loving, life of the party, hilarious, smart, witty, talented, and so on, you, and then there’s the other you, and most of the time he has the louder voice. “You” you is the other you’s worst enemy. They live inside of the same body and the other you can’t stand it, and he wants “you” you out. 

Depression is laying in your bed with the lights off and the windows blacked out barely able to muster up the motivation or energy to walk to the kitchen to pour a glass of water. Depression is getting ten hours of sleep and waking up exhausted. Depression is getting out of bed and putting on the skin of a happy, normal person for an eight hour work day. Depression is forcing laughter, faking smiles, caking on layers and layers and layers of disingenuous, fabricated happiness just so that the people around you don’t label you as “sad,” or “negative,” or a “mood kill.” Depression is finally coming home, getting back into bed and staying up until 4 A.M. doing absolutely nothing except reminding yourself of how worthless your life is and how much better off the world and every single person in it will be if you weren’t in it. 

Depression is ignoring phone calls. Depression is ignoring text messages. Depression is isolating yourself from every person in your life. Depression is wanting nothing more in the world than for every person you've ever met to forget your name. You want to just disappear, and you want everyone to forget about you. You don’t want a funeral, you don’t want sad Facebook statuses or candlelight gatherings, you just want to go and you don’t want anyone to think about it ever again.

Depression is a disease and it’s a disease that you can not get away from because it is a disease that lives inside of your head. It is impossible for you to think about the future because it is impossible for you to imagine a future. There is no future. 

You are nothing. You are worthless. Your son will be better off without you. Do you really want him to grow up knowing that you’re his father? You really think that he could benefit at all from having you around? Stay alive just so you can fill his life with disappointment just like you’ve done to everyone else that has had to deal with you? The best thing you could possibly do for him is not forcing him to grow up with a father like you. The world will be better off without you. You are a nuisance. You are a dead weight dragging down every person that knows you and a cancer to every situation you involve yourself in. You can’t go on putting people through the suffering that is having to deal with you and your crap. You are doing the world a favor. Just do it. You will never be happy. Just do it. Why are you so scared? Just do it. Just end it. It’s not that hard. If you suffer you deserve it. You are worthless. Don’t you ever forget how worthless you are. Just do it. Everyone is going to be okay. You know that they are better off without you. Just do it. Just do it. Stop thinking about it and just do it already. 

This is the voice that lives inside of my head. On the way to work, at work, at church, at the grocery store, at the park with my son, opening presents with him on Christmas morning. Sometimes it's a very soft voice, sometimes it is screaming. Sometimes it’s relatively quiet, but it is always there, and it has always been there for over twenty years. 

Depression is a disease and diseases hurt. Sometimes the hurt is more than a person can handle. Sometimes the voice becomes so loud and so persistent and the pain so deep and overwhelming that all you want to do is shut it up and stop hurting. You just get tired. Really, really tired.

I have made attempts to end my life. I have spent time in a juvenile psychiatric ward sleeping on a foam mat in an open doorway without sheets or a pillowcase because I was on suicide watch. I still struggle with the same thoughts but I have thankfully learned to cope with them for the most part.  

I could go on, and there are many more points I would like to make and I may create another post if this is something people would like to talk more about, but I will end this one here. Depression is not sadness. Depression IS NOT weakness. Depression is a disease that you are physiologically predisposed to and have to live with. You can not simply “suck it up.” You don’t tell a person having an asthma attack to just suck it up and start breathing normally. You don’t tell a person with cancer to quit being such a crybaby and get out of bed. Mental illness is an illness. You can’t see it on an MRI or listen to it with a stethoscope, but it is real and it is killing people. 

Before you speak out against those that have lost their battle with depression, take a step back and try to be a little more sympathetic towards that person, their family, and their disease. I know it must be hard to imagine what it is like to want to die. I know that I probably sound crazy to most of you, but I know that some of you can relate to what I have said. I have kept these things extremely private for most of my life out of fear of being treated differently. I didn't want people to assume I was crazy, or act differently around me. This has been incredibly difficult to talk about, but if it helps even a single person then it is worth all of the discomfort I've experienced in writing this. 

My thoughts, prayers, respect, and love go out to every person that has gone to find their peace, the families, friends, and loved ones of those that have been touched by this terrible illness, and finally those of you that got out of bed today and lived your life in spite of your demons. 

You are not weak. You are not crazy. You are not alone. If you've got nobody to talk to, talk to me. I'd love to listen.

13,"All these years, I have felt so alone. Although I am a young girl, I have more mental issues than I should have. More secrets than I should have. A more fucked up daydream than I should have. 
I have so many issues like self harming, feeling all alone, suicidal thoughts that I know that I will never be able to act on because I am a wimp, insecurities, and so much more. There are so many dark depressing things that go on in my mind but again, there are so many light amazing things that happen. Things that make me feel better again when I am sad. Things that help pull me away from my blades. 
I have so many secrets like again self harming, the tooth that I once had when I was younger that I pulled out myself, the history I had with this one boy in school who now ignores me and I know judges me, the feeling of loneliness I get around my mother who hates me, my father who is in jail, my sister who hurt herself, and so much more. 
Now the daydreams is the most fucked up scariest thing about me. This certain daydream is what screams ""psycho"" and ""fucked up girl"" and even ""daddy issues!"". 
I daydream about my mother lying to me about who is my father. That my father was actually Casey Cott, who is 24. The only way to explain that he was my father is to say that he got raped, in my daydream, when he was just a kid. I know, truly fucked up. But then I would daydream about him loving me, cuddling me, and giving me the affection that I always needed. Giving the affection that I thought I deserved. The thing that makes me even worse is that I tried to make it true with subliminal affirmations, and wish pages, which isn't going to work but I keep trying.
I have done so much things in my past (sending nudes, stealing money from my mother, making a youtube video that exploited my sister's self harming and my past) that I regret and they were all from my childhood. What to do?

What do you think that says about my mental health? I am mostly curious about that. ",28Jul2017,2

15,"Basically for all my life, i have been building personas to fit the person im talking to. I always invented new ""characters"" to make the person im talking to kinda comfortable. 

(I believe that this is because i was mentally and physically abused by my brother for my whole childhood and i just didnt want people to be angry at me.)
My personality depends on the people im around because i shape a certain character for them. 

But as i keep on doing this, i'm less and less sure who the puppetmaster is. 

I don't know who the person really responsible for these characters is. I cant even write down who i truly believe to be me.

Whenever i feel safe and calm, i instinctively have an inner voice tell me that, who i am acting as isnt actually the real me. It ruins basically every interaction i have with other people.

I feel lost because i cant enjoy conversations with others anymore and even when i am only thinking, i still remind myself that who i am thinking as, at that time is not actually me. So i cant even fully enjoy thinking anymore

Come to think of it I have these high/low episodes in other situations in life. Like for a few days I can feel happy and ""high"" with my work and research and then I'll suffer what feels like a burnout for days after. The burnout is like a crash in mood.

That sounds a lot like Bipolar I know, but the last thing I want is to pester the doctor for yet another ""syndrome"". I don't think it is. I think this is the calm before a storm and what I'm actually experiencing is a ""meltdown"".

Ive tried cognitive behavioral therapy and its absolutely useless 

Recently tried Ketamine infusion therapy with a dr but I had a horrific reaction and got derealization which is still persisting. The dr who did it is unhelpful and claims its not related to the Ketamine when I *know* it is. 

WTF AM I SUPPOSED TO DO???? Therapy is useless especially since my problems seem to have started from neurochemistry and neurochemistry is a HUGE trigger for me.

Ketamine which is supposed to help so many people actually made me worse off than I was before. I wish I can return to the state pre ketamine.

Im constantly anxious about how I am feeling. My mood and feelings drive my negative cognitions 100%. Wtf do you do when this is the case??? 

I cannot ""sit"" with these feelings. I am seeking therapy but its completely worthless for this problem. Why do they say therapy is a treatment when all the say is modify your thoughts or learn to tolerate these feelings? Hell no--I want to get rid of this problem since I want to return to the 100% normal life I had before it started. I don't see any obvious cognitive distortions in my thoughts. And noting cognitive distortions doesnt even help my mood improve.

My mood is 100% the most important thing. For 21 years until this began I was pretty much *always* in a normal/good mood hence my goal is to get back to that normal state.

This problem has prevented me from achieving my dreams academically and also socially since I havent even had a GF or pursued one since this began. Fuck this problem. 

I want this gone.

I am constantly regretting trying the ketamine therapy bc of the derealization side effect and I cannot let go of it until that problem itself resolves. 

My mood is my justification for ALL my negative thoughts. Im not going to think positive unless my MOOD is positive. Because whenever I try to use CBT or whatever its totally useless when my mood is driving my thoughts.

What most people don't know is that for the past two and a half years I have been plagued with never quite feeling like myself. Having thoughts that are distressing invade my mind involuntarily, they don't feel like my thoughts and I can recognize that. 

I go through phases of feeling hopeless, tired, suicidal and anxious. I seem to slip between mild anxiety, a short fleeting day perhaps of feeling alright but not normal and then falling into depression. 
You know you're fucked up when depression is welcome because at least that was familiar before everything fell apart. 

I have been on medication for about two years and I can't remember what is was like to regulate my own emotions. 
Sometimes I say things to people that in my head seem reasonably normal but when they come out and I reflect on what I've said I realise it was perhaps a little odd. 

I hate my job but I don't actually really get why because I am good at it. Why hate it? 
Over time since I got really sick I have wanted less and less human interaction. I have slowly lost my belied that people are generally good and nice and now believe that basis of humanity is selfishness, animal tendencies and greed. Not to say that there isn't good but that if there is a sense of threat then these will come forth. 

Funny thing is though despite all this, a small part of me hasn't given up hope that a reasonable chunk of mental recovery is possible. That I can go back to a place of confidence, happiness, wild social enjoyment, success and peace. 

I don't know why I felt the need to write this. Thanks for your time
