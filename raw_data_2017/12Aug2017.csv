2,"I will be direct and to the point. I have a brother and father who both have untreated bi polar 1. My dad has decided that he will treat it with weed, which is 100% ineffective but he refuses to hear anything negative about it. He has even refused to go see his last two psychiatrists because they, like myself, are seeing that it's ineffective. My little brother spent 2 years under a 12 pack of bud ice a day to deal with his issues. He is now one month sober, which is wonderful, but he has been on meds before and hated it and doesn't want to go down that path either.. He is swinging back and forth into mania every 48 hours it feels like. I basically raised him, and any action I take is going to feel like I am abandoning him, but I am 32 and still live at home, I feel like if I leave I am leaving my mom to deal with all of it. I need to move on and move out, I have been doing this for half my life. It has led me to the point where I have no social life or friends. How in the hell do I get out of this rut.

3,"Does anyone else sometimes get feelings like their hands are way too large sometimes? But then when you pick something up, the object feels too large and your hand feels way too small, but also still too large at the same time? With other things too, tongue feeling too thick and too thin at the same time, time passing physically slowly (like you can almost physically feel it pushing past you) but rushing by quickly in your head at the same time, feeling heavy and light at the same time, feeling like you're floating and falling at the same time, sitting completely still and almost unable to move but simultaneously feeling like you're moving forwards really fast etc. I've had this ever since I was a little kid, and sometimes it gets really intense (like now) and freaks me out. I was just wondering if anyone else I know gets anything like this at all? I *think* it's a type of dissociation, but I'm really not sure. It gets hard to concentrate or think straight at all when things are like this!
I'd really appreciate hearing from anyone else who feels these things, or who knows about these things, as it really gets to me sometimes, feeling a little less alone/like a freak would be nice :/",12Aug2017,1
4,"My friend is an incredibly smart and sharp person. Unfortunately he's been suffering of depression and can be suicidal. But he doesn't let anyone approach him. Our social circle has experience with people with depression already, some have received mental health first aid training, some are even in the psychology field. We've pulled through with the people in trouble, and most are doing fine nowadays. But this guy is a whole different challenge. It's almost impossible to keep contact with him, or to get him out of his house and much less out of his mindsets. We've tried everything that appears in mental health resources. He has received counselling, but doesn't believe in them. He depends on medication, but even then he doesn't seem to improve. We just don't know what else to do. People are starting to give up. Everytime we chat to him, his responses are awfully complex and just shuts down anyone wanting to help him in anyway. It's just the way his brain works, his intelligence levels are incredibly high.

This is pretty much the hardest thing I’ve ever had to write. 

I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder January 23, 2017 at age 25. This was 13 days after my last suicide attempt, and the last time that I cut myself. I had already been self harming my body with razor blades and an eating disorder for about the last 17 years; something that I kept hidden from everyone. It was a secret, and a shameful one at that. I checked myself into therapy because I did not want to resist the overwhelming urge to kill myself; I think about suicide as if it’s my “Ace in the Hole”, I know I always have an out if I want it. I was running out of reasons to not slit my wrists and bleed out in a bathtub full of warm water. Mostly I didn’t because my tub in particular doesn’t seal very well so the water wouldn’t stay full and that wouldn’t work. By no means am I a mastermind, irrational or rational, but I knew way, way, way down, under all of the uncertainty and insecurity, I truly did want to be alive. I wanted it to be acceptable to the Universe that, I to, wanted to have something that I could love and hold on to, and it wouldn’t leave me.

If you don’t know about Borderline Personality Disorder: Congratulations. 

In essence, BPD is a mood dis-regulation disorder in which a person, mostly women, cycles through mood instability, impulsive tendencies, self-destructive behavior,  fleeting sense of self/self identity, and unstable interpersonal relationships. BPD is typically some kind of trauma-induced  mental illness where the person irrationally fears abandonment and will do most things to avoid it. No— That’s not true, I would literally do anything to avoid it and I have done things that I am not too proud of to avoid it. It is not quite like being Bi-Polar where a person might swing between manic episodes and periods of depression; I race through emotions at light speed through out the day, and honestly, it’s exhausting. There are no medications that truly alleviate symptoms and many mental health professionals dispute among themselves if it even really exists. It is notoriously difficult to diagnose and many professionals don’t even want to put the diagnosis out there because BPD patients are considered too difficult to treat because of their fluid inconsistency. You can count on a Borderline to be unpredictable and most people eventually do not have good experiences with Borderlines. Suicidal idealization, self harm habits, impulsive behavior and the mood swings seem dramatic and alarming to more normal, better coping people. Borderlines come off as willfully manipulative, attention seeking and self centered individuals, ultimately resulting in the abandonment and rejection we fear the most. In actuality, Borderlines are often creative, intelligent, entertaining, passionate and inquisitive people. We just can’t think and feel at the same time. We’re much more inclined to hurt ourselves than hurt others.

Being unstable is a mother fucker

If I’m not doing something somewhat stimulating at all times, my mind wanders to some dark places. My fear of not having a place where I fit in and serve a purpose has led me to some unkind places and I have erratically tried to belong somewhere that’s not meant for me. Right now I’m happily feeling pretty normal, later I could be irritated all day at nothing and ready to lose my marbles in a depression, self-loathing fueled rage in a second over something someone else considers a minor annoyance. Sometimes it feels like I’m walking around with no skin, nothing to protect myself with and everything hurts. My choice in relationships have not helped my sense of self identity, but the relationships I “didn’t” have a choice in haven’t done many positive things either. I have found myself in more relationships than I can count, some very fleeting and some that meant more than the world to me. There was one where he had joked he liked “crazy girls”, and I laughed along. It stung, but I felt so unbelievably lucky that I thought I found someone, anyone, who by even considering loving me, was doing me a favor. I was lucky to have anyone. When he actively seemed to press on my triggers and rile me up, I wondered why, but then quickly thought that I was over reacting. Obviously. When he gave me the silent treatment, I would apologize until he talked to me again. I didn’t have the BPD diagnosis then, but I still felt like my feelings weren’t real. My lens was broken, I thought, I was probably blowing it out of proportion. When it ended, I blamed myself. I felt as though my body were coming apart as I sobbed and asked why, why, why, why. I asked him “Why not me? I don’t understand”. I begged the Universe to fix this thing that was wrong with me that made me so awful and so ugly that I didn’t deserve to be loved. I just kept repeating that I was sorry, as if I had failed. I really didn’t know what I was apologizing for. Existing, probably, and I had the pain in my chest, in my heart, that would not stop telling me I was just destined to be alone. There wasn’t anyone out there who would ever love me. I didn’t even love me, so how in this world could I even ask or hope that someone would see me as anyone worth having. I had lived in this vicious cycle my entire trying-to-form-relationships-life, even strictly platonic or friendships. It is defeating, soul-crushing, overwhelming despair. It must be what Hell is like; eternal damnation and punishment for reaching out and asking to be loved, validated and wanted. Please give me a sign its okay for me to be alive. I feel like there isn’t one, if there is I can’t see it by myself. I don’t understand why I would be put here and made to want something I can never have. It’s a cruel joke, and I’m the punchline. 

Recovery has been the hardest thing I have undergone in my whole odd life

I’ll fully admit that I’ve walked this Earth for as long as I can remember believing that I was a broken person. I was defective because I wasn’t wired right. When I met with my psychotherapist for the first time and she told me I was Borderline, I really thought I had a special way to say “crazy”. BPD just sounds bad. It’s as if I’m on the verge of being a psychopath, I thought. I am in month 7 of weekly therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT skills). It’s fucking hard. I constantly would tell myself what a piece of shit I was because all of the bad, mean, or wrong things I have ever done that now I have an “excuse” for. I still did those things and hurt people along the way, I thought, and now I’m supposed to embrace the fact that I’ve been mentally ill this whole time and couldn’t help it. I’m just a hurricane waiting to strike at any given moment. I’ll hurt you but I can’t help it doesn’t sound great when you say it out loud. How I felt about myself leaked over into how other people viewed me, or in my mind judged me. I was a real party. Admitting that I have a problem I cannot solve myself, and then following through and consistently getting help for it, made me angry and embarrassed. I felt like I now had proof because my illness made me broken. It was as if I now had concrete evidence that I was a “cruel” person. That I was “too much”. That I was “crazy”. And most defeating that I was “unloveable”. I was just unbridled chaos waiting to strike.

I used to believe those things without hesitation. I hesitate now, and believe them less. I make a living amends for my destructive behavior by working on my recovery every day. It’s not to say that I’m completely better now or that I love myself. That’s still really hard. I did start dating again, and I am now dating someone who does not hurt me. No one is doing me any favors. I try not to rush, as rushing is another way of saying please don’t leave me. It’s not “I love you”, “I value you”, or “I see you”. That takes time and takes information, vulnerability and moving through fear. True partnership requires honesty, patience and risk. These things terrify me, but I try anyway.

This is how I know my recovery is working

On my own journey of recovery, I have found true freedom in exercise. I find that through the challenge of physically becoming a stronger and healthier person, I am beginning to be a mentally stronger and healthier person. On this road of picking my pieces back up, I am realizing I can become unbroken. There’s no rule anywhere that says I have to feel sorry for myself or that I can’t change. I can have anything if I’m willing to work. I’m ready to keep working. 

The truth about me is that I am a willful, strong and kind person who practices empathy where I can and when I hurt someone, I apologize. I talk way too much when I’m nervous and I know too much about otherwise useless, dorky things. I’d be a star on a quiz bowl team. I used to break doors and kick holes in walls when I was angry (which I do not recommend, btw, shits expensive) but now I find clarity and peace through Crossfit. I’m not perfect and I’m so beyond weird that it’s not funny. I make mistakes. I’m really afraid of hurting people. I love Disney and will never admit to being as much of a Basic Bitch as I secretly am. I follow 4 porn star accounts on Instagram. The road to where I am now has been hard fought, and I honestly didn’t think I’d make it. I haven’t come this far to just come this far. I have hope. I never thought that I would honestly be able to admit that. I also happen to have Borderline Personality Disorder.",12Aug2017,2
7,"A few weeks ago, I finally saw a psychiatric nurse practitioner after years of struggling with a multitude of symptoms, the biggest one being depression. The past couple of months, however, I've been sleeping 12-14 hours most days, and unable to sleep at all at times. I was motivated to go because I truly can't get up some days until 2 pm (thyroid and other blood work is fine). I explained this and some other symptoms with the NP (anixety, irritabily), and she decided to treat me for bipolar depression. I'm on Seroquel three times a day now, and so far all it's done is make me sleepy for a couple hours after I take it. I work in mental health and haven't heard the term bipolar depression without a bipolar 1/2 diagnosis. 

My question is, does this mean I am bipolar, or just that my depression is bipolar as opposed to unipolar depression? I will ask my provider the next time I see her, but I was a little flustered at the time. Any input would help, thanks.",12Aug2017,2
8,"So for as long as I can remember I've been emotionally numb, not in a negative way persay but just a flatness of emotion. When something good or bad happens I don't actually feel anything in reaction, good or bad. If I were to describe my emotional 'landscape' it would be the middle of the ocean, complete and utter calmness and silence. This has helped me be emotional calm and rational but socially I know I'm not the same as others. I can laugh, smile and generally be happy in a sense but it always feels like I'm reacting in a way that a normal person would, it's a conscious decision. Not to say I've never felt anything, rarely say when I see a genuinely funny comedian I'll have a smile on my face but there is nothing behind it. Any way to work on this or what it even is?

9,"Hi okay so I just realized that the way I hear sound is kind of really weird. 


I swear, I am not high. I am sober, and do not drink nor take any drugs.

I'm *extremely* sensitive to how sound feels. I can walk through my school hallway between classes, with my eyes closed, simply by hearing where everyone is as they walk by. I don't have a perfect ear, but I have taught myself four instruments. 


Slower, more ""heavy"" songs (perhaps songs that pull across you, like 1,000 years, or Say Something by Great Big World) feels like warm honey that encapsulates my very being. Or Magic by Coldplay, feels like what it would be like to walk with swagger. Believer by Imagine Dragons feels like pressure on my stomach. 

Not like a physical feeling, but not *not* a physical feeling.

Non-song sounds feel a lot like vibrations, and I can feel which direction they're coming from. 

This is incredibly overwhelming because I have an semi obsession over the tempo of daily life, and hearing something that goes against  the tempo upsets me. Like a clock that's ticking is a little off, or a toddler crying in a loud supermarket (the loud supermarket doesn't always stress me, but sometimes it does depending on if it's louder than what is normal, or the tempo of the conversation is too fast or high pitched).  Typewriters are literally the best sound though. 


Can anyone tell me what this is????
I looked up synaesthesia but I can't find anything on this. Or is this completely normal? I can be extremely mellow about life ~~except for the usually daily existential crisis~~. It can be completely enjoyable, especially listening to new sounds, words and music, but can absolutely overwhelming in normal human settings (despite being a natural extrovert). 


**TLDR:*** I hear weird. 


**add on:** perhaps unrelated, but I'm really good at learning languages. I'm trilingual and learning to code. Also, very sensitive to touch, and  sometimes, people around ""my bubble.""


Thank you!",13Aug2017,1
10,"Hello all, first time posting here. I have been recently diagnosed with ""unusual"" bipolar II (in which i do not have hypomanic episodes that last for hours or days). I am currently going through talking therapy. My previous psychiatrist kept messing up my refills, therefore i switched to a new one very recently. My parents are affording all the treatments and medications expenses, but they haven't been doing well financially. I am an international student in US and feel overwhelmed and stressed while researching and understanding how things work here (insurance, alternative treatments etc.). 
I've had my worse depressive and hypomanic episodes after a break up, but within the last few years, i've learned a lot about myself and my symptoms by constantly educating myself about my mental illnesses. This has led to less frequent and less severe episodes, especially after seeking out therapy. 
I am starting to meal prep and exercise and practice better sleep hygiene (i have the hardest time adjusting sleep and i just started on melatonin). I know i have to consult the professionals, but is it possible that i can just see my therapist weekly and forgo medications for now? I do dread about relapsing indeed, but those episodes were situational yet unpredictable/uncontrollable. Thank you for reading this and any input would be appreciated.

P.s. I still don't know my take on psychiatric medications. And i have been actively looking for cheaper options/resources while not being eligible for Medicaid.  ",13Aug2017,3

12,"Going to college this upcoming week for my freshman year. For about a year and a half (junior to senior year) I was friends with a guy. He was a good friend at first. We had stuff in common. He helped get me a job at the McDonald's he worked at. He had PTSD, and a rough upbringing from what he told me. My brother was also good friends with him, and I didn't even seriously suspect tjat he was a huge liar about a shit ton of stuff until my brothers then girlfriend said something to us. These are the things he told me that made a lot of sense would be a blatant lie- he told me he had shot and killed multiple people. Another time (heis a person of color) he said he was working the drive through window and the the person he was giving food to called him a beaner etc, and he said he punched the guys window and broke it. I do not know why I believed him I though anything could happen with how fucked up he told me his life was. He always liked coding and stuff like that and said he got a shit ton of scholarships and wanted to do business major, but a day or two after he went on a date with a friend of mine who is a CNA or something like that and a few days after he said he has a bunch of scholarships and is going to be a doctor.  Biggest lie that upset me the most- he said his parents kicked him out of the house, and being concerned I offered him to stay at my house. He refused and didnt want me to tell anyone, and so I told some of the guidance counselors at my high school and a cop I knew just to see if they could do anuthing. I was incredibly worried about him. He never got kicked out. His parents apparently just were getting annoyed that be wasn't doing what he was told and got into an argument with him. I talked to his brother and step sister about and and they both said he lies all the time, and I asked them if anything he said was true (there were a lot of other things he probably lied about) and they said no. So, I messaged him telling him my friends and I found out hes a pathological liar or whatever, and he started coming up with excuses and never denied or confirmed it, so I blocked all contact with him. Sorry if it sounds insensitive . Should I just blame the ptsd, or just blame him as a person? Thank you for reading

23,"Hi

This is a legit question, I'm wondering what my fault is, feels like I have one but can't quite figure out what it is.

A little about myself, I'm a male in my mid twenties currently treated for bipolar disorder, not sure if I have that but it's not unlikely so haven't ruled it out yet. When it comes to mental disorders I trust my own judgement more than any therapist.

I get very depressed in periods, suicidal ideation but also extented periods of total indifference to anything. I used to believe I had social anxiety, which I did but it's not that bad anymore, nowadays I just don't want to socialize since I get nothing out of it, I suspect everyone that gets close to me for plotting against me, plotting to hurt me, humiliate me or even murder me.

Another issue of mine is that I constantly lie to get by in life, I lie about pretty much everything to everyone and I easily get away with it too, I feel no remorse for it and many parts of my life is built on various webs of lies I constantly need to keep in mind, my life is incredibly seperated depending on which part of it I'm connected in, I kind of see it like different levels in a video game.

I also sometimes get homicidal ideation, the idea of killing someone would be a way for me to assert control but I don't believe I would do it, there's no way of knowing how I would feel about it before trying so I can't really say more about it.

When it comes to relationships and whatnot I mostly use it to feel better about myself, I usually get cold feets a few months or so into a relationship and start detaching, this has caused a lot of hurt on the second part but I really don't feel anything other than fear of revenge on their part.

Worth noticing that I have a history of drug abuse and often threaten suicide and self harm in relationships. I've also had psychotic symptoms a number of times, mostly hearing voices, once or twice seeing ""shadow people"". Thinking I'm being watched by the people shown on the TV, driving around the city for hours believing I'm being followed. (All this while sober, although those times when I have taken certain drugs I've gotten psychotic symptoms pretty much every time, mostly from stimulants and cannabis.)

So yeah, what's wrong with me? am I normal?",13Aug2017,5
24,"I was standing in the shower trying to wash away the panic and figure out what had triggered me. Then it dawned on me: I was afraid of men. A simple text, snapchat, or like on social media sends my heart racing, knees weakening, and waves of nausea coursing through my body. Anticipation. Pacing my house before a date, dry heaving, cancelling. This is my life. I was in a physically and emotionally abusive relationship for a few years. I realize this is also why I take so many showers, in an attempt to wash away the invisible scars. Sure, I can talk myself down from these episodes of panic but they have placed a barrier between me and other people. I want men to see me as a strong woman, not someone that's easy to take advantage of. This is why I'm not talking to any guys right now, why I'm not going out or on dates, I don't want anyone to see my scars, to see fear overwhelm my body. Anyone else feel this way?",13Aug2017,8

31,"Not sure if this is the best sub to ask this in. If there's a better place, please let me know and I'll post there.

No doctor or therapist has had any idea what I'm talking about the several times I've tried to explain this to them. I've tried Googling to no avail as well. This is probably because what I'm describing is super vague and abstract in nature. The only other person who has experienced something similar is my sister, although not quite the same. It might be hereditary.

So basically, this happens most often when I'm lying in bed with my eyes closed, trying to fall asleep. I start to get a thought, accompanied by sensations (for lack of a better term) of ""objects"" that have extreme physical properties, such as extremely dense (like an infinitely small point with infinitely large mass, capable of tearing through the fabric of space?), extremely thin, extremely heavy/massive, etc. This is almost always severely uncomfortable for me to experience, and I need to open my eyes and/or squirm to get rid of the feeling or ""idea"". It may come back when I close my eyes again, several times. Other times it's gone after one occurrence.

I know this is a really obscure concept so I'm not expecting many replies, but if you could point me to a subreddit that could possibly identify what this is, I'd be appreciative.

I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety when I was 12. Since then, my anxiety has shifted and spiralled to include panic disorder. I briefly tried anxiety meds several years ago but quickly got off due to the side effects making everything worse. I was in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship for four years, and since coming out of it, despite my life getting tremendously better and me actually being content, I've just felt like my mental health has plummeted. My anxiety is out of control, I have panic attacks almost daily, and the most startling of all is a reoccurring sensation of depersonalisation. I just don't feel present, like I'm dreaming. I can't feel anything. My body is numb, and in the height of these feelings, emotions seem out of reach as well. I've lost interest in all the things I loved before, and I have absolutely no motivation coupled with extreme self-loathing. I moved away from my home country (that I despise) seven months ago and haven't been able to work or make friends, and maybe that's contributing to it, as well, but when my family came to visit I just felt like they were strangers.

I'm not an angry or aggressive person, and I'm terrified of turning into my abusive ex.

I noticed that my tremors are worse, anxiety is heightened, some periods of feeling SOB (probably anxiety related), extreme fatigue, twitching while sleeping, sensitivity to sunlight, brain fog, head feels like it's not attached to my body. 

I'm not sure how much longer I can stand these withdraws. I have to work and I know it's going to be difficult for me to do this while working. I'm also PMS-ing which doesn't help anything. I feel miserable.",13Aug2017,4
