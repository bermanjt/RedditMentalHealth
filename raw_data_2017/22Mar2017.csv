3,"So, I have been in an amazing LDR for 6 and a half months now. Things have been great other than my mental health, but recently since she went back home from visiting over the holidays in December, my mental health has CRASHED.

The reason I'm here is I'm wondering.. can mental health for example, my mental illnesses are OCD, BPD, Bipolar, PTSD, depression and ROCD. Can these mental illnesses affect me feeling emotions or feelings for my fiancee? Can it make me question things? Can it make butterflies and daydreams diminish? I have been asking friends AND my fiancee, and they say it's normal, but I thought I would ask here.

I have been very numb, and the thoughts are causing me to question my wedding, when in January I had been very excited, and now I feel no emotion or excitement for it. Thank you in advance.",22Mar2017,2

5,"So recently my girlfriend has been living on campus and travelling back and forth to home, which is 20 mins away. 

She's been telling me she has been having night terrors since she was young, but they've gotten much much worse since she's come to university. Including one last night, which involved her getting held hostage with a knife (which is a common object used in the terrors) andgetting into a car crash.

Today is the worst part. She got super giddy and we were having a good time and when I went to shut off the lights (on her demand) and lay down she lost it, shreaked and held her face saying I was terrifying with no explanation. Then a few minutes later burst into laughter and couldn't even speak (kinda like she was possessed) and then stoped abruptly, asked to check her closet to make sure a man wasn't in there and then curled in bed repeating ""don't hurt me"".

I'm terrified. I imagine it's just stress but I'm at a loss for words. Like an open eye, cognitive nightmare.

Edit : she isn't taking anything, off birth control, she did unprescribed ritalin to get schoolwork done 4 days ago. She was completely normal before this incident and seemingly after too..

TL;dr gf is having night terrors and they're affecting her awake life (?)",22Mar2017,10

9,"I'm sorry if this question has been asked a lot before or if it's not suppose to be here. And I know that all psychiatric wards are different, but I just kind of want an idea of what it's like to be in a mental hospital in case I need to go. I live in the us. I have depression &amp; anxiety and I'm on medicine (Prozac 40mg) but it doesn't work for me and I've been taking Prozac for 3.5 months. I've been kind of suicidal but I think I'm fine for now. I'd just like to get an idea of what I'm getting into if in the near future I decide I need to go to the ER if I'm suicidal


Again, I know it depends from hospital to hospital and each area but..


If you go to the ER and say you're having suicidal thoughts or want to harm yourself, do they just keep you in the ER or do they take you straight away to the mental area? Or do they evaluate how you feel and either send you home or admit you if they see you as a threat to yourself?


When you're in the actual physiatrist ward, what it's like? Do they have psychological nurses (or whatever they're called) or just regular nurses (I don't know much about medical stuff so idk if all nurses are just the same or if some have a special focus in a certain area). Do they have therapists or psychiatrists or any specific mental health workers?     How long do they keep you there if they admit you? Can you leave if you feel better (and they think you're okay) or do you have to stay a certain amount of time? Do regular hospitals do any kind of treatment or do they just hold you and make sure you don't die? What's the actual ward like..like does it look like a regular hospital, do you have to stay in your room, is there like community areas? The mental stuff is on the top level of my hospital so I've never been there. What type of other patients are there? Again I know this all varies but overall/your experience. 


I've never even been admitted to the hospital or ER for anything. The only times I've been there is to visit people or to get blood work. Just walking into the hospital gives me anxiety. Any new experience I haven't gone through gives me anxiety. I know it's a lot of questions but I'm just curious and need to try to mentally prepare myself and know what I'm getting into in case I need to go. I'm not asking for exact answers, but if any of you guys have gone to the hospital for feeling suicidal, what was your experiences and what was it like for you? Thanks :)


Edit: extra things I thought of lol
Do you share a room typically or do you have your own? Also I assume if you're admitted to the hospital you have to wear the hospital gown thing, right? Or in the mental ward can you stay in your regular clothes? ",22Mar2017,1

11,"Hello fellow redditors, I am in need of some SERIOUS help. So i'll start off by saying that I started browsing the internet casually around the year of 2011. I used to get homeschool because I was socially awkward, this led to me into becoming a recluse.

I haven't left the house in over five years and all I would do is browse the internet 24/7. I eventually started joining forums and I discovered that one forum wasn't what I expected at all. The off topic section of that forum was supposed to be about random discussions like food,girls,life problems etc yet all of those guys would talk about is race and religion.

Now, like any sane human being who doesn't like negativity,  I should've left. Idk what it was but I just became extremely addicted to the site and I started to develop hateful views even though I'm one of the most open minded individuals out there.

I absolutely hate that site and what they've turn me into. I have anger outbursts, intrusive memories and much more. The thing is, those guys don't actually interact with the types of people they despise. All they do is sit around making up false stories based off of hearsay.

The problem is, I can't leave the site. It's like it's ingrained in my dna to go there even though it's screwing me up mentally.

What should I do?

17,"This is gonna seem stupid, but I have a real hard time taking out the trash. I just chuck the bag on the porch. When I have a chest high wall of garbage then I go fill up the apartment complexes trashcans in one fell swoop. I've even had professional help with this issue and no such luck. When I do take out the trash I feel like Patton rolling through the Sigfried Line.

Another one, TV addiction. I can waste my life on this thing. It's gotten to the point that I can't have a TV in the house or subscribe to any streaming services. Here's the trippy part, I hate TV. I hate the way it makes me feel when I watch it. I feel dirty, like I'm being pandered to. Yet, if TV is around that's all I do with my waking hours. By carefully controlling my environment I am able to manage this addiction. Everyday that I don't watch TV is a victory, the result of real struggle.

Tell me your struggles! We're all in this together.",22Mar2017,1

42,"I've been in a situation where seeing a particular person, or even thinking about them and some of their tendencies, cause a very strong response. My heart rate goes up, my thoughts will get negative and focused on envy and discomfort, I have an urge to leave that location and the recurring event where I see that person, and I imagine conversations with this person where I say things more rude and cutting than anything I would ever say out loud.

46,"I think I am a VERY passive, lazy, unmotivated person. I have been failing my studies because I can't find the strength to actually start doing something. I sit for hours and hours watching YouTube videos or reading stuff, even though know I am supposed to study. I feel superbly frustrated and stressed while procrastinating, yet I just can't force myself to do stuff.

And because I am like that, I get frustrated and unhappy with myself. Every evening I tell myself ""Tomorrow I'll be productive"" but I never am. I am postponing everything, I can't make myself exercise even though I want to.

I have changed courses and I think it was a great decision after failing miserably in the old university. I'm interested in my new course. After lectures, I feel really motivated to learn more about it, but as soon as I come home and sit down, I lose all interest.

There is SO much I would like to do and achieve, but I'm afraid I never will. It's as if I don't have any energy to do important things. For example, if I go to lectures and cook lunch afterwards, that's it for the day. The rest of the afternoon I'd spend watching TV or Youtube.

I am starting to wonder if I'm secretly depressed (I'm cheerful and not suicidal whatsoever), or if I'm so afraid of failure because of the old university, that I can't make myself try. 

I wonder if anyone here experiences the same thing. Any suggestions welcome!",22Mar2017,21
47,"I've been starting to realize that the people I've called my friends don't really care about my well being.

I'm not sure if this has any connection with my mental issues but I know these friend related problems aren't helping it lol. I keep hearing things about them making fun of me and talking trash about me behind my back but everyone seems to say it's not how it sounds. They've begun to flip the problem and get angry at me, when I try to put things into perspective all that happens is i get even more angry (I see that they use me for everything but never give anything). Am I the one at fault?

49,"To start with im a 17 y/o Male who lives in Turkey.
To make this post short Im just gonna list the problems i have!

1- Since my childhood i see peoples head much smaller and far away than they really are when there is distance(not much min.30-35cm) between us and i focus on their face it was just the head BUT i think (see the second problem) few weeks ago when i came home and i was pulling off my shoes my mom came and we started to talk about sth(i think it was exams) and when i look at her face it got like i lot more smaller immidieatly and when i looked at the tv(it was on) its frame (not the screen i was sure) started shrink then i stopped looking at it , i was used to heads shrinking for 20-30sec but this one lasted more than a minute plus nearly 30sec. Tv shrink.

2-i lost my sense , perception of time like literally. Not just knowing the day but for ex.: i think of a memory i have or someone tells me about it but i cant know if it was yesterday, last month or last  year sometimes it feels like a really old (definetly not important) ""memory"" happend last week (or vice versa) i literally dont have any perception of time (im having this problem for the last 2 max 3 years i think :/)

3-sometimes i feel like my hands are a lot smaller and mostly thinner like super thin it used to last for few seconds but the ones i had in the last few months(?) lasted for more than 30secs and way more effective than the others (no visual change but via touching them with each other(handception). (This is also a really old problem like the first one)

4-so sometimes i have this thing i call ""Mindfuck"" which fuck ups all of my perceptions , senses etc.(not the five main ,physical, senses) i dont really know a way to describe it all i can say is everything besides my five main physical senses explode like Oppenhemiers first baby (i know who i am and where i am but nothing else especially what fuck is going on) and these used to be nothing more than 10-15 secs but the last one i had in monday evening lasted more than 1,5 mins. It started like the ""ordinary"" ones but then it immideatly got sooo powerful it was like the Uber-Super Saiyan version of the previous ones it was literally the worst experience of my life

5-sometimes everything seems stranger to me including my own body!
for example ; i was walking down the stairs and i felt like the body im in is irrelevant,stranger,like an external case to be honest.

6-sometimes when i sit straight in my desk i feel like my body is moving (might be relevant to the one below) front and back but not moving like walking more like a very very stable shaking but im aware its not moving

7- when i lie down on my arm/s i can feel my pulse very very powerfully and clearly and sometimes i can feel it in my fingers and on the tip of my fingers (not lying down or touching them with other body parts) 

I dont know what to do , i know that first one is Alice in Wonderland syndrome/micropsi , i dont know what these are , i dont use drugs , i have never drinken alcohol, i wasnt dehydrated , hungry/starving, sleepy (i cant sleep idont feel need for it i can only sleep when im bored which is rare especially at night because idea,thought bombings to my concinous mind barely stop) or tired.
What should i do , what are these things , am i fucked?",22Mar2017,2

57,"First of hi everyone, this is a very long story. 
I feel the need to talk to someone but my mother won't let me. In 2014 I moved from Chicago (where I had been living in since I was two)to Washington. Most of my family is in Chicago and when I heard I was devastated, I didn't get to say goodbye to my friends and I bearly got to say goodbye to my family as my mom wouldn't let me. Ok fast forward to Washington and boy was I anxious, mostly because I was starting high school all alone and I was scared. That summer I spent it in my room. I had and iPod but we didn't have wifi so I couldn't talk to anyone. I felt alone and depressed I would cry myself to sleep sometimes, I really wanted to go home. When school started I threw up twice before going, the school was very small and everyone knew each other so I felt like an outsider. Then a couple of weeks later it changed I had friends I was doing way better. I still missed home but not as much. I was doing good in school and like I said I MADE FRIENDS!! We all became pretty close and I got comfortable there. End of that school year my parents separated and my mom, my sister and I moved to another small town an hour away. Starting school I was nervous but seeing as I made friends in my other I hoped it would be the same here(mind you I'm a very very shy person). It wasn't, nobody would talk to me, now I wasn't being bullied or anything but I just felt depressed again I missed my old friends and I missed Chicago. I started skipping school my mom worked in the mornings so I would just stay home, that school year I think I only went for like 1 full semester. I made a friend there just one but we had fun it felt sooo god to talk to someone else. In that school I got put in algebra again I had already taken algebra twice, in Chicago I was supposed to start taking advanced classes but when I moved I got stuck in algebra again learning things I had already learned. We moved from that town in the summer. And now I'm in a different high school I told my self I would try harder and not miss any school, but as I'm typing this I'm skipping school. I know I should go to school, I don't want to keep doing this to my mom (I think that they'd be better of with me dead). Staying home just seems much better then going to school. If I'm going to be alone I might as well me alone and comfortable at home. There's a lot more to the story but I just needed to put that out there. Thank you.  ",22Mar2017,20
