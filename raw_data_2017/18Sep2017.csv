3,"He's depressed. He has anxiety. He's angry. He's told me these things. But he's also wonderful to be around when his true self shines through. I've struggled with depression my entire life, and am still going through some substance abuse trials and tribulations.

I've started to notice that he would ""drink more than he meant to"". Or ""make a drink too strong"" on accident. He would budget his money by cutting back on food, but spend a ton of money on alcohol. We don't live together, so I don't know how often he actually drinks.

He likes to lie about his drunkenness. He will lie to me about how much he's had. He will lie about drinking at all. He will only admit to a little when I find out. He's had increasingly more blackout and brownout episodes than when we first met.

Alcoholism runs in his family and he's witnessed his dad battle it. I've talked to him about how I don't like him drinking. The issue is that we are in college, and there is a lot of socially acceptable drinking that goes on. I think somewhere deep down he knows that it's not good, but the people around him are encouraging it. It makes me sick.

He changes when he drinks. He treats me differently. He lies. He picks on me. His jokes become more vulgar. He won't listen to me and will keep talking over me. It's embarrassing - I'm a strong-willed woman and do not let people do these things to me. I also don't want to become his emotional punching bag.

I love him. We've talked about marriage. We've been through a lot together. My question to you is this: what should I do? When I get upset or prod, I think it's doing more harm than good. But I hate seeing him like that. What do I do?

Please help - I'll take any advice. Thank you.

5,"I am probably seeking mental help relatively soon, but I actually don't know what kind of background the professional should have since I don't actually know or understand what, if anything, is wrong with me. And I don't really know where to start, so here's a wall of text with a few things: 

I am 28, from the US (Midwest) and female. I have a job and a Ph.D., so none of this has really interfered with my life functioning, except relationship-wise. I suppose the biggest issue is anxiety. I compulsively make sure my door is locked. In grad school, every time I sat down to work, I'd get so anxious and jittery that I picked a scab on my head until it got weird and then I had to have it surgically removed. My dermatologist was the first person I admitted it to. My teeth were also clattering when I picked at that area.

I get overwhelmed easily. I cannot drive because I am not good at processing external information. My dad always made fun of me because once when I was learning (no license still) I cut a corner really fast and I just said ""I forgot to stop."" I don't know. I just feel foggy sometimes and have a delayed reaction to things. 

And today, I was nearly hit by a car because I was thinking about SO MANY THINGS and then I recognized the street, stopped at it.. but I guess I only looked one way? After the car going one way passed, I just went into the street and someone was going the other way. I didn't fully realize it until I got onto the bike path and someone said, ""Fuck you."" I don't really know what happened, either I have so many problems paying attention or I am not processing information right. I wasn't intentionally trying to be an asshole and would have gladly waited and not risked my life, but I honestly somehow managed to screw up. There are numerous other similar instances, and I am grateful I am still alive.

I feel depressed and sad sometimes. I'm not sure it's enough to qualify as bona-fide depression. I just get a little uninterested and don't want to do things occassionally. I am also a bit scatterbrained and foggy, as I already mentioned, I have problems staying focused. But, I don't think ADD is right because when I do focus on something I like doing, it's pretty hard for me to get distracted.

Lastly, I think personally (and I'm not a professional and do not have a background in psychology), autism would make the most sense. I am fucking terrible at reading faces, recognizing faces (face blindness), socially awkward, clumsy as sin. I'm pretty sure I've offended people without trying to be an asshole. I suspect I have minor sensory issues, but I don't have a frame of reference for it. Certain sounds like wrappers and people eating chips annoy me, although I suppose misophonia != autism. I also have issues wearing shirts because I don't like the feeling of cloth on my torso, so I generally wear loose fitting shirts. I cannot carry a conversation, either.

My question is, what am I supposed to do and who should I see when I don't know what the problem is? How does this work? Can I see someone more general who might help me and refer me to someone with X speciality if they believe it's X? I have the number for my health insurance's mental health coordination service, but I don't even know what to say when I call because it's too much and I honestly don't even know why I'm about to call. 

If you've read this wall of text, I greatly appreciate it! Thanks!

7,"Im not bipolar. I have depersonalization disorder. Mood stabilizers are the only class of drugs that i have yet to try. I've taken antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, etc. None of those have relieved my symptoms of Dissociation. I drank on my previous meds without any issues, is it safe to do that while taking Lamictal?",18Sep2017,0
8,"Ok, so about 8 months ago I went to see a school therapist for depression and anxiety, (mind you, my symptoms did not start out severe, it was more a general feeling of ""something's wrong"" and my mother is bipolar, so I wanted to get checked out), and she recommended that I see a clinical psychiatrist because she felt that I needed medication. My mom is on meds, and she did much better on them than off them, so I was open to it and agreed to see a psychiatrist. This psychiatrist was late to the first appointment. I mention this because she was late to every appointment with the excuse ""I have other patients"" every time. (I understand you have other patients, but can't you just schedule the appointments later if you know you're going to be half an hour late every session?)I disregarded it because I felt guilty that I was upset that she was late because I thought I was being selfish. After hearing my symptoms, she prescribed lamotrigine and lorazepam. The lamotrigine didn't take effect until months later, but when I was on the lorazepam, I became suicidal, so I asked to be taken off it until the lamotrigine took effect, but as we increased the dose of lamotrigine, I started getting very paranoid (it was so gradual I didn't notice), and I started questioning whether my friends were pretending to be my friends for the laughs (they would never do that to anyone), if they planned to ditch me, or if they just didn't have the courage to tell me to go away. I also started hallucinating. I would hear my name called out, music, at night I would see ""people"" watching me from my closet, which kept me from sleeping. As the paranoia got worse, the doctor prescribed me risperidone, which did nothing. I was also getting really worked up about it and started thinking that I was actually going crazy. Several times I called the psychiatrist to get help and she didn't respond until days later, once it was two weeks until I heard back. I thought she was testing me to make sure I was progressing. At one point I had a doctors appointment (a physical, where I expected to get my blood drawn and have to strip down, both of which I have fought doctors over), and I didn't think I'd be able to finish the appointment so I asked for lorazepam. She said she'd prescribe it to me at the next appointment (which was a week before the physical), but when the appointment time rolled around she never showed up. I called and didn't hear from her so I ended up getting Xanax from my primary care who knows how I am at physicals. I didn't feel comfortable continuing to take the meds without a prescriber. The psychiatrist had previously told me that she'd sanction me if I stopped taking my meds without consulting her, but I couldn't reach her, and if I told my primary care that I wasn't gonna take them I was afraid she would sanction me, so I kept it to myself while I gradually got off all meds. After I was off them, I started to feel less paranoid and a lot better (I still have lasting symptoms that I didn't have before the whole ordeal, but I figure that's what happens when you take antipsychotics). Obviously I was more depressed, but I was still depressed on the lamotrigine anyway so I was just happy to be able to sleep. Now, a couple months after I got off the meds, I'm less suicidal and paranoid than when I was on the meds, but my symptoms are getting worse. I am reluctant to see another psychiatrist because of what happened last time, but my mom and one of my professors are pressuring me to seek help again. I don't know what to do. I think I can learn to control it again (like I had before seeking help originally), but it's going to take a while and I'm afraid that if I get too comfortable I'd let it slip to my friends or my roommate that I got off the meds or that I'm depressed and they'd take me to a mental health center. That's my worst fear. I can't get sanctioned because I'm in college and it would've wasted my dad's money since he paid for tuition and I know my symptoms would get worse in a medical environment since I get anxious and paranoid in hospitals. Any advice? Should I get help again?",18Sep2017,1
9,"I don't think anyone understands that I find every interaction tiring. Putting on the ""I'm ok"" face. The ""I'm super fun"" face. The ""I really want to be here"" face. Inwardly I just wonder why the fuck they want to listen to me drone on about trivial stuff.

11,"So, while i have been away at college, i have noticed that my resentment has grown and has created dark idealizations. WARNING: MAY TRIGGER!

I tried to talk to my mom about sexuality and i was shot down. My mom didn't believe me when i had walking pneumonia. She has guilted me about weight, saying how i could get a heart attack, then giving me a candy bar after guilting me. When facing gender issues, i tried to talk to her about the situation and she tells me about the time she was molested. Also, she had me go in the backyard and had me explain everything about my issues to my dad and stepdad, who i didn't even talk to about my gender last summer. Then, before college begins, she points out everything i didnt do and how i do nothing. 

For my dad, he's always angry. When he doesn't eat, he bursts out in anger and puts me down. During vacation, i pushed the wrong buttons, and he opens the door, goes to my side, and starts yelling at me. For my weight, he always says how i used to look good, and has this image of me being muscley. He has an unrealistic goal for me to reach. 

The combo of these two has led to graphic, violent fantasies. Like one where i put a gun to my head and have my parents play true or false game and, if they got an answer wrong, i kill myself. And, i have thought of graphically killing my dad. Also, i have thought of harming myself just to prove a point, but never have.

I don't want to be this angry towards them, or even feel this way, but everytime i think of them, it fills me with this type of intense anger. Is there any way i can alleviate this anger? I dont want to think like this.

P.S., im not angry at the moment, but i get this angry just thinking of my parents. Also, i don't intend to commit self-harm or suicide.",18Sep2017,3

Doing a simple errand is an incredible effort. Grocery stores depress me, *everything* depresses me. The heat &amp; sun are blinding, even buildings are miles apart from each other.  Walking is stressful with traffic noise everywhere. Being a pedestrian, I feel like a tiny ant about to get run over. I have extreme noise sensitivity and get sensory overload.

17,"I only recently started noticing this because my husband pointed out that I can be very focused on the negative things in life. If I let my mind wander I usually find myself thinking about negative things, for example: past abusive relationships, times I have been bullied or mistreated, worrying about a social interaction I had and whether I made a bad impression, etc. Even my dreams I noticed are often nightmarish. 

I find that I dislike letting my mind wander because it is unpleasant for me. I have to fall asleep with my computer, surfing the internet, when I am cooking I have to have a video on, and I have to fiddle with my phone if I get stuck at a stop light.

Is this abnormal? I only started noticing it recently because I see the contrast with my very positive husband. Is it possible to change to a more positive outlook and to let go of this negative pattern?",18Sep2017,2

20,"Okay...  To start, I am an 18 year old female.  I have no friends in real life and only two online people who barely even talk to me anymore.  Never been able to have friends without them leaving me for something/one more interesting.  I don't feel I can connect with people beyond a superficial level.  They just don't care.

I was severely bullied in school.  When I was in 4th and 5th grade I would get punched and beaten constantly and they teacher could not have cared less.  I got death threats and was called an ugly bitch.  I never did anything provocative first.  I was just really fat, and I hit puberty when I was 9, so my face was a pimple landmine.  Also, my school was mainly black and Hispanic.  I was white and know 0 Spanish and the Hispanic kids really hated me for that.  In middle school people hated me from a distance.  Nothing physical or verbal anymore, but I could just feel the resentment when being around them.  I was put in honors classes and most of the kids wished I wasn't there.  I saw eyerolls and heard ""uuuuuugh.."" sometimes when I was around.

My family also isn't a big of me.  Mainly my sisters.  I have 2 older sisters who thrived on making themselves feeling better by making me feel as shitty as they could.  I have extreme anxiety issues, and back when I was little [5-9] I would be punished by them for showing any signs of depression or being anxious.  Slapping me, slamming toilet lid on my head, locking me in a pitch black rooms, telling me how I am scum, saying I shouldn't have existed, not letting me see friends... etc. My oldest sister's favorite was to make fun of my mental illness in front of her SOs.

I cut ties with both of my sisters, but that surprisingly did little to help me feel better.  I still have no one to relate to.  I feel like I deserve all the abuse that happened to me.  I often think that I should have been aborted.

The little friends I actually do have a connection with end up abandoning me nonetheless.  My first bff in real life completely ignored my existence when she had a boyfriend in her life.  She invited me for pizza and soda after school and one of he exes was there.  Needless to say, I was invisible to her.  The only good thing was her mom let me use her computer and I got all my homework done.  The bff cut me out of her life after that.  Now, my best long distance friend is starting to forget about me because of a boy.

I started to distance myself from my online bff because he has an SO and is focusing on college as well.  Again, I'm put on the backburner.  No matter how hard I try, I end up getting left in the dust.  Now he only texts me when he needs something.

I have gone days without talking to anybody and no one notices.  That's the thing about me I guess.  No one ever notices me.  Even people that used to talk to me on a daily basis really don't miss me when he don't/can't talk.  

I have only been in one relationship in my life.  It lasted for one year, but his love for me way before the year was through.  I know this because he was telling all this to my friends. my online bff relayed the info to me. I was a boring, uninteresting person.  He dumped me and, without any consideration, started to try and date my friends.  It still stabs me in the heart to know that he almost succeeded.  Oh yeah, my ex also treated me like absolute shit after leaving me.  He told me that I was a bitch and how boring I was.  He sent nudes to my closest friend. He started to talk about how lonely and without love he was right after leaving me.  He started cutting himself and attempted suicide.  I must have been the world's shittiest girlfriend... 

Whenever I try to talk about my problems or depression I get told to shut up or that I'm just a negative bitch.  Now I just sit in my room all day looking at Facebook memes.  I post statuses sometimes, but no one ever reads them.  I would try to go out, but I have no license to drive.  Also I wouldn't know where I would even be accepted.  

I also feel worthless because my online bff could go to an Ivy League school because of his 30 on his ACT and I'm going to a rinky dink community college.  He almost got into UChicago.  He was too far from Chicago and the class was already over-enrolled.  If he were closer and less people applied, he would have gotten in.

To recap, I feel like shit because I was abused and bulled severely as a kid and have no social status at all.  I have no friends at all.  The only thing bringing me joy is weed.",18Sep2017,7
21,"Kind of a long post. If you're taking the time to read, thank you. I just need someone else to see this. I love her so much, but shes been mentally abused before by other guys and it's had a lasting effect on her. 

So this week I have 2 classes I need to attend. I told my girlfriend about these classes, and I've told her multiple times before and she's been cool with it. But tonight she freaks out. She said that my university degree doesn't matter and that It will get me no where in life. 

She realises these classes are coincidentally on her days off. She accused me of lying about them, basically telling me I don't need to go, and that I am making things up. Problem is I need to go because I am unprepared for my final year of University and getting there early will help me. She didn't understand this because her university experience was much different to mine. She didn't attend her lectures or classes and I do.

She gets upset at me and literally just becomes the biggest bully ever, and I don't care if I sound wimpy. She'll mock me for being close to my parents and ask if I'm running home to 'mummy'. Before I really understood her BPD moods, we had a similar argument where she called me boring and hit me with a belt, that night I said I would go and buy roses for her. I just didn't go back to her. She said that really upset her and it was the worst thing I could have ever done.

She locks herself in a room. Eventually I decided to get keys and get access to the room because locking yourself away will not solve the situation. She basically tells me I'm dumped, that I'm useless, and she needs a man who has lots of money and can drive. Basically everything I don't have.

We had this ceramic skull and in anger she threw it at the wall. I picked up all the large sharp pieces because I knew she'd try and cut herself with one of them. So instead of that she picks up some extremely small shards of ceramic and swallows them. I'm left shocked and panicking because she's going to have possibly hurt herself internally.

I tried to walk out of the room. She gets up in my face and asks if she intimidates me, which I respond yes to, and then she clenches her right fist and raises it up a little... At that moment I thought she was going to hit me and all I wanted to do was stand away from her. 

At this point I panic, go to grab my phone, and dial for help. She wouldn't let me do that because she's afraid of hospitals. 
Her mind began to race after she saw my phone, she asks ""Who is she?"" (I've blocked out all the girls I was ever friends with..m I didn't understand this.) And ""I know what mind games you're playing... When I'm at work you don't text back for hours. You do it on purpose to make me upset and anxious."" (To which I don't. She'll give me tasks of cleaning up and it takes lots of my time, and honestly I'm just not glued to my phone all day long.)

I just felt it was really unfair of her to do that, to refuse professional help when she is clearly struggling. She just broke down into tears after this and cuddled up to me, everything had has calmed down 

We're okay now, and we acknowledged the BPD moods weren't actually her real self. I just need help so badly. After everything has calmed down I just feel really sad. If anyone has any kind of advise whatsoever, please it'd be appreciated.",18Sep2017,1

25,"I've been straining my gf of 6 yrs with accusations of cheating. They of course hurt her feelings, and frankly I'm not sure why I hadn't stopped. 

At about roughly the 2 or 3 year Mark our relationship took a bit of a dive with infrequent quality time due to school and being too focused on friends. I later came with a brash accusation she had been cheating on me with a friend, due to my insecurites and her prior comments of her just being unhappy with me. Later I went to Spain and broke up with her due to strains and perhaps for her to allow to see if I'm right for her. Prior to returning we decided that our lives were better together and got back before I returned to the states. 
Then for some reason I just could not believe she wanted to really be with me and instead found some manner to be polyamoirs but be happy with me. I reasoned her cheating is to make up for what I couldnt give her which was just a good time. We do get along well, but this is certainly a damper.
We went to sf with friends and I assumed she had feelings for a friend we just met that she would frequently talk to. I asked and she maintained that it was platonic and that the friend was also a fan of me. 

So when I was 12 my parents went through a nasty divorce which no detail was not spared to me. My step dad, whom my mom told me was my real dad at the time, would tell me about how my mother was a whore and had cheated on him. It was incredibly traumatic for me and stuck with me ever since. My stepdad was pretty abusive which cause my mom to do this I assume.

33,"I suffer from anxiety and recently it has been particularly difficult to the point where I feel like I am suffering constantly throughout the week. Thank you so much for reading and providing any feedback.

&amp;nbsp;

TL/DR: Background on my anxiety - work - and some specific instances of anxiety.

&amp;nbsp;

My anxiety comes from work. I am worried all the time that I'm not doing a good enough job. I joined this team almost a year ago last December. This is the most challenging job I've had since I've graduated (two jobs prior, same company). Although I don't looooove the job, I am really happy to be in this job; however, it is causing me so much anxiety!

&amp;nbsp;

My boss is a good guy, really smart, and when we aren't talking about work stuff, he's quite pleasant to be around. But at work when it comes to my projects, I can't help but feel like a dummy still. I know it has only been a little over 10 months, not quite new but not a year yet, and although my two direct colleagues and my boss have been there for at least a couple of years or more, I put so much pressure on myself for not knowing as much as they do.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm trying so hard, but stuff that gets me down are the little mistakes I make and the feedback I get from my boss. He gives direct feedback, he's not putting me down, but I just feel so dumb that I keep missing the mark on stuff. And I only get these little projects still and I feel like my boss just doesn't trust me and looks down on my abilities to bother even giving me bigger projects. My group's audience is so high level (C-level at times) that the nuance in everything we do is so challenging that I feel like I'm losing my confidence in myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also sometimes in meetings, when I am trying to kick things off, my boss will jump in, cut me off, and pretty much ""save me"" (not sure how else to describe it) because I may not be going in the right direction, or I might have a longer introduction to the topic, pretty much not giving me a chance. He keeps doing it and doing it. I tried to get feedback last week around this, and the feedback is good, but I wonder if he knows he knows how hard I'm trying to prepare ahead of time for f*cking everything and I keep getting cut off.

&amp;nbsp;

Last Friday has made me so paranoid all weekend. I made a mistake on a project that I feel like I shouldn't have made and feel like I've totally blown any confidence he has in me. I really feel so f*cking ashamed and have been suffering. As I type this I am getting emotional because I have to go to the office soon and face the day. What happened was I didn't follow up with all the salespeople about their clients and only a small group of them. When I initially spoke to my boss about the project, the way he laid it out seemed like we were only following up with a smaller group. And when he looked at me and said that we should've reached out to everyone and to go back and reach out, I was CRUSHED. Totally crushed. As I sat at my desk playing catch up, squeezing the life out of the stress ball at my desk, I couldn't help but feel like I am going to get fired eventually. That my days are numbered and it's just a matter of time he's going to get rid of me.

&amp;nbsp;

This fear of getting fired is amplified by my current financial state. I am paying off a credit card and don't have much ready access to cash. Although I should be done paying it off at the end of the month, this fear of getting fired is so present that I am so afraid that it's going to happen before I can start rebuilding my savings. This awful feeling often gets bunched in when I am suffering from anxiety at work in real time. I get physical paid in my legs on top of the emotional pain, it's really, really awful.

&amp;nbsp;

Often when I wake up in the mornings, like this morning, my mind immediately goes to work and anxiety. It is awful, from start to finish of my waking day I am suffering.

35,"I spent an hour trying to find the right title for this post but that was the best I could come up with. I'm going to go into very long specific detail so, sorry for the super long post. I don't really know how to TL;DR or summarize this.

throughout my life when I watch extremely graphic horrible things in the form of video or imagery I can turn my ability to feel anything off and not get effected by the graphic images/videos.

I'm going to go into some examples here so you get a better understanding of what I mean. If you get easily effected by someone going into detail about graphic things like gore, blood, stabbing, etc. I'd recommend not reading the rest of this post if you're easily effected by these things, please.

Let me give a pretty recent example of this. Some of my friends and I were watching http://runthegauntlet.org/ which if you don't know is pretty infamous for being a website that shows some of the most gorey, vile and bloody imagery on the internet. 

While my friends were watching the blood and gore and giving pretty genuine reactions to what was going on, I was pretty unaffected by what was being shown on screen. I was pretty cold to it all, allof the gore, blood the people on the screen dying by being hit by trains, etc. 

However, strangely there was this one video that got to me more than any of them combined. This happened maybe a year ago so my memory is sort of failing me probably, but I'm going to try into go into as much detail as I can.

There was a lady on screen getting stabbed by who I think was her boyfriend in the middle of broad daylight in the middle of a road. There were people around and nobody stopped to help her for a long time, they just stood there watching until after this lady had been stabbed maybe nine, ten even thirteen times a guy ran in and pulled the guy off of her.

This enraged me. How could nobody help her in broad daylight while people just stood there and watched? Seriously, I was so enraged I wanted to jump into my computer screen and stop the guy who was stabbing her. 

After the gauntlet ended, I asked my friends which video they thought was the worst. None of whom said the video I thought was the worst. They all talked about how the videos they thought were the worst were the ones with the most gore or death, or blood. But in those, nobody could help those people or there was a very limited window in doing so. But, nobody was trying to help that lady? It was burned into my mind for the rest of the day.

So in summation for this example, I was pretty infuriated that nobody helped that lady when she was being stabbed to death in that video. But I felt nothing/was cold/indifferent towards all of the other gored, bloodied and vile videos shown during the gauntlet.

and it's not like I don't exhibit emotions on a daily basis. I do, when my friends are in really bad trouble in their lives I console them and genuinely care for them. I'm a huge cry baby as well. I do exhibit emotions and care for others, It's just. I can turn my emotions off whenever I need too. 

What is wrong with me?

Some stuff about me too since I haven't really gone into what my living conditions are like or how old I am.

I'm nineteen, I live in Maryland in the USA and I'm pretty happy with my life currently. It hasn't always been that way, most of my life has been horrible but right now this is the best my life has been and the best version of myself I think I've been and I don't dwell on those bad times unless they're brought up in some way or another. My grades are great, I have a ton of hobbies that I'm really happy with doing. My relationship with my family is pretty good as well, although that has been only recently. 

Is there something wrong with me? If there is, what do you think it is and can I get help? Because I do want help if it is a problem.

Thanks for reading all of that if you did because it was long and I'm sure took a lot of time. 

also thanks for any advice/help anyone might give me in this thread.

edit: If there are grammatical errors and I'm sure there are a ton. I'm sorry, I'm really lazy and I didn't really think to format this properly when I wrote it.

42,"**BACKGROUND**

A couple of months ago, I was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital based on a single social media post. That post read:

&gt; If the police keep killing unarmed civilians, at some point there will be a violent uprising against the police. I can't say that they wouldn't deserve it.

An ex-friend of mine (who happens to be a campus police officer - who have all of the privileges of real cops) saw the post and had me 302'ed. 

The police came to my house on a Sunday evening, would not let me get dressed (I was only wearing boxer briefs) or put on shoes. They handcuffed me in front of my neighbors, pushed me into the back of a squad car, and took me to the nearest emergency room.

During the trip to the ER, the two police were cracking ""looney bin"" and ""nutcase"" jokes in the front seat.

**IMPORTANT STUFF**

I was admitted to a dingy, segregated portion of the ER for ""crazies."" I was told by ER staff that my 302 warrant was weak and that it would be overturned as soon as I spoke to a doctor.

That didn't happen. The ER staff left out the part about the doctor I needed to talk to being a psychiatrist. Guess who doesn't work on Sunday nights?

I was told that I'd be involuntarily committed for 72 hours. To a hospital three hours from my home and family. 

I don't deal well with being lied to. I lost my shit. I threw chairs, tried to escape, and hulk-smashed a janitor's cart. Hospital police (again, what the fuck is up with all of these different police forces?) ultimately calmed me down - at gunpoint. I was given a shot of ""the cocktail"" in the ass and don't really remember the next few hours.

**THE PROBLEM**

A couple of days ago, I found a painful lump behind my ear. Nothing massive or crippling... but certainly uncomfortable. 

In the days since it has grown from the size of a dime to about the size of a quarter. The pain has gone from a dull 2-3 to a screaming 7-8. My family is urging me to go to the emergency room.

I don't think I can. 

The embarrassment of being cuffed and dragged away in front of my neighbors in my underwear caused me to break a lease and move to a new town two hours away. I quit my job.

I can't even watch reruns of Scrubs or Grey's Anatomy without freezing up and flashing back to those cops pointing their guns at me while a nurse injected me with drugs against my will. 

So instead of dealing with this incredibly painful lump behind my ear, I'm swallowing painkillers and hoping that it'll go away.",18Sep2017,30
43,"How are you managing your energy for effectiveness at work? I'm on Lamictal, Sertaline, and Latuda to manage my BPD. I fall somewhere on the bipolar spectrum between I &amp; II.

I just feel generally fatigued all the time and want to naaaaaap.

50,"I always drive to therapy thinking through the things that have happened since last week and tend to not come up with much to talk about until I sit on the couch. Today it wasn't until the second half that we brought up assertiveness and my pattern of minimizing my own needs for others, blaming myself for situations where I wasn't in the wrong, or just not speaking my feelings. The trajectory will be practice conversations and situations so I can learn some of the assertive responses available to me in a variety of situations.

Here was today's problem: even talking about being assertive made me feel small and defensive. My helpful little brain heard ""Assertive"" and replied, ""Assertive? These are all the times your mom said you should be more assertive and you felt bad about not standing up to that bully/teacher/stranger. How about the time your theater teacher deliberately tried to criticize you in front of your whole class in order to get a rise out of you to fuel the anger you were supposed to have in that practice scene? Ooh, I know! Let's remember the self-defense classes where you had to yell at a stranger pretending to threaten you, and how you cried because it felt weirdly silly but then they kept making you do it over and over?""

All my therapist did was ask me how I felt about doing an exercise where we walked towards each other and I would say ""Stop"" when he got into my personal space. We didn't even do the exercise!

It makes me feel so sad/angry/small to think about all the times my mom would say, ""You should be more assertive,"" or even test me by coming up with brutal practice skits on the subject; however, she constantly judges others and makes assumptions (e.g. ""The depression is an attitude you can change! Just be more positive!""), which, ironically, is where I have learned that it's easier to just let people say and do what they want, without standing up for myself.

GRR! Mostly just wanted to vent about that. I'm not sure how to start practicing being assertive when I have all this anxiety built up around the word itself. I have known for years that it's something I need to work on and right now it feels like part of my identity is being a doormat/wallflower/pushover/any of those other names my mom has used to describe this behavior.",18Sep2017,2

55,"I've been friends with this girl since kindergarten, we've both just got out of high school. Since 6th grade, her mental health has been on a decline.

In 7th grade, she showed symptoms of anxiety and depression. I remember she would stay away from other people and mostly hang out with me and a few of my close friends.

In 9th grade she started having severe panic attacks and frequently had to walk out of class everyday. In grade 10 she couldn't take it anymore, so she went to an online school.

This past year she told me she's been having dissociation from reality. I can recall we would be hanging out, then all of a sudden she wouldn't recognize me anymore, she'd see me as a complete stranger and run away from me. Then today I find out she's had hallucinations in the dark, but now they happen during the day.

I found out she's written suicide notes for everyone she cares about, including me.

She's been in and out of the hospital more time than I can count on my hand. What she's telling me is she believes her counselors/whatever look at her like she's crazy.

57,"Hi

I was put on 20mg Fluxotine 2 months ago to help with my mild depression and anxiety. I also suffered from erectile issues that i'm sure was related to my overall mood.

It took no time at all before I was starting to feel a lot better - i'd say about a week in and I was feeling like my normal self - my sex drive was at its peak and the erectile issues were gone. I was able to get and maintain an erection until orgasm.

As time went on, my sex drive started to diminish to the point its basically non-existent at present. The ED is back in that I can get an erection, but it doesn't last long.

Since about a week in I was feeling great and everything was working, I figured that I should speak to the doctor and get my dosage reduced to 10mg. I took my last 20mg on Friday and didn't take anything until my first 10mg this morning. I did that because the half life of fluxotine is 3 to 6 days and I wanted my body to get to the 10mg level as soon as I could to hopefully see the benefits.

I'm not 100% sure what my exact question is, but do you think i'm correct in my thinking with the reduction in dosage to alleviate the sexual side effects?  I know everyone reacts differently to SSRIs and anti-depressants but does anyone have any advise?  I'm happy discussing alternative medicines with my doctor but she seems to prefer to stick to tried and tested tablets - i'm in the UK btw.  Note that i'm also aware of CBT and Mindfulness - will these help me with the sexual problems?

Happy to answer any questions anyone has...

Thanks",18Sep2017,2

59,"My previous doctor, who is a narcissistic idiot, had me diagnosed as bipolar 2 from age 10 onwards based solely on my manic reactions to SSRIs. That bitch blatantly ignored child abuse and a severely dsyfunctional home and school life and helped my parents brainwash me into believing I would never function without a cocktail of less than 5 strong medications.

I finally tried to commit suicide just to get away from my parents earlier this year and after a rather traumatic hospital stay was put in an intensive outpatient place that finally recognized the abuse I had suffered throughout my life. Because the abuse I suffer *now* is emotional/verbal/manipulation (dad is too smart to hit me now), the docs were limited in what they could do. They suggested I get a job and move out and diagnosed me with environment-induced general anxiety and major depression, with possible PTSD. Unfortunately, due to the abuse and gaslighting at home I was still suicidal and the last-ditch medication I was put on to prevent another hospital stay drastically increased my anxiety and made it impossible for me to work, let alone move out. 

Now I'm out of the treatment program and seeing yet another psychiatrist. She speak in riddles and questions and I can't get a straight answer out of her. For example, I want to go off all my meds because I believe the meds have always made me worse, not better, and all this time I've actually being ""treated"" for med side effects/withdrawals not actual mental illness. I also strongly believe I have PTSD from the abuse and want to start EMDR with my therapist, who is okay with the idea but wants me in a much better headspace since EMDR is intense. Her response is ""well, what if I disagree with you?"" and I'm like ""uh, I don't know? You're the doctor but I know I'm right. I don't want you to be mad at me, though."" And she says ""Well, toastedeggs, you're an adult now. All I can do is make recommendations. And my recommendation is that you go off the Lithium, then start Depakote, and then we'll go from there.""

I'm really scared that she doesn't believe me about the abuse and still thinks I'm just another crazy person who hates their parents. I *think*, based on what the outpatient doc told me about my meds, is that with my current med combo, Latuda and Lithium, Lithium is much easier to DC than Latuda, so to avoid hospitalization she's putting me on Depakote to offset going off the Latuda. I tried to ask her why she's putting me on Depakote and she just smiled and said ""it will help stabilize you."" I agreed to go on the Depakote but I'm so scared it will cause new problems and I'll be ""diagnosed"" based on those problems.

I just want someone other than my therapist to affirm what I know, that I'm an abuse victim who was gaslighted, drugged, hit, screamed at, and forced to watch her brother be abused in even worse ways. I wish my new psychiatrist didn't talk in riddles. It's so annoying, but if I piss off this doctor I'm not sure I can find another one. She also said that I'm *supposed* to tell her if I feel she's not on my side but what if she takes that as paranoia instead of my mother being a manipulative witch who has a 100% success rate of turning allies against me? There's a reason CPS never got involved: my mother manipulated mandated reporters into not believing me! I don't want to lose this doctor to the dark side...

Any ideas about what her motivations might be? I see her again week after next and start the Depakote tonight. I'm fucking terrified and I don't feel safe calling her.",18Sep2017,2
60,"I know that this is probably not the sort of post that people want to read on this sub but I feel like I really need an outside opinion on this matter. I know that the usual sort of thing to say to somebody who is concerned with their mental health is that they should seek professional help but I don't want to waste anybody's time/money since I'd be using the NHS so I'm going to ask people here if there is anything I should do before heading down that route.

I've been having concerns for the past several weeks in regards to my own mental health. I have prescribed mirtazapine in the past and I have been suffering from anxiety and depression since I was a young teen although I am now suffering from certain symptoms that I haven't been before.

I don't know how to describe this fully but in as concise terms as I can, there was a couple of weeks in which I was obsessed with certain things and it had a strong impact on my relations with my family in a very negative way. At the time I had a view of the world as being incredibly harsh and cruel and I thought that whenever I tried to point these cruelties out I was shunned because nobody wanted to listen to it. I mention this because this was an obsession for me for a couple of weeks and I can only look back at it now as an obsession.

Following that I smoked a joint, which was a big mistake because while I was high it was as if I was having a bad trip, basically. I was basically unable to function and I was just sitting there in the chair, my mind going at 100 mph although the most concerning part for me was that there was this ringing in my ear, which morphed into a tune over a few minutes. I wasn't just hearing this ""in my head"", I was actually hearing it as if it was being played out of a speaker. Then, moments later I started seeing figures out the corner of my eye which caused me to panic although they went away after I sobered up.

However these symptoms have returned since then and they are almost constant, especially when I am on my own and especially the figures in the corner of my eye. I have not smoked weed since then although that seems not to have mattered since the symptoms have continued regardless of that and I keep on seeing them, even right now, in the corner of my eye.

I am aware that they are not real but this does not make them any less terrifying and constant. I feel like I am thinking more clearly than I have in years but I cannot avoid these hallucinations, and I am deliberately doing everything I can to stay in tip top mental condition. Has anybody else experienced anything similar? I need somebody who can help me with this.",18Sep2017,2
