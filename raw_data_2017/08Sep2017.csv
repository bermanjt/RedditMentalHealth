2,"Hi! I've been on Zoloft for about 5 months and I've noticed a decrease in my anxiety (this could be due to the SSRIs or an improved outlook on life that has come with new hobbies/better sense of self). HOWEVER, my sexual abilities have been compromised I suspect. Also, I like to experiment with pyschedelics and ever since I started taking SSRIs, they have had barely any effect on me. Anyone have any other drugs they recommend to alleviate OCD/generalized anxiety disorder?

4,I was in a relationship shop for a decade where I was abused and raped. I believe the situation has given me PTSD and it is ruining my life. I've called every single mental health provider in my area and the soonest I can get a psych evaluation is 3 months from now. I can't wait. I really want to get an evaluation ASAP and at this point will pay whatever it costs. If anyone knows of any legit place online I could get an evaluation and get a diagnosis I would be beyond appreciative. Thank you!,08Sep2017,3

6,"Context:



Lately I've been having episodes where perhaps I should be reacting to stress or disappointment or frustration (college is a headache after all), but in my mind I'm at terms with everything and am totally calm about it. Just do a mental sigh and am all ready to move forward and continue and do whatever task I have lined up next.



But, it would seem that quite surprisingly my body has a different opinion that it isn't sharing with me.



In my head: Just fine. Totally at peace. Calm, collected, maybe a little bored? Just going about my day. 
Physically: Lump in my throat. Cracking voice. Face heavy and possibly about to cry. Even caught myself trembling one time.



This has happened 3 times in the last 2 weeks and I am at a loss for what is happening.



Again, I admit that when this happens there are excuses for why I'd have reason to become emotional, but the emotions are defiantly not there. There's legit no weird emotions to be making weird responses. But yet physically I'm reacting as though there were. 



I am entirely at a loss during these episodes because I don't know what is happening (it's a complete surprise) and am trying to play detective as it occurs. ""Oh, just now as you spoke, what did your voice just do? Ah, there again! Is that cracking? A tremble? *You* *almost* *just* *cried* *just* *now* *???* **Wtf!?!?""**""



So, I'm confused. Why are my mind and my body holding entirely different emotions, not telling each other, and leaving my trying to puzzle out what it's up too? Any ideas how that even works?

7,"Hello,

I have a general problem with poor boundaries, however it is not the same as codependency because I am not in a romantic relationship right now.  I tried reading some codependency books to help me with my boundaries problem, but they were all focused on people in intimate relationships and I am not in one so I don't relate.

My boundary problem is with everyone.  First, I get pulled down way too much by other people's bad moods. I tried reading books for ""highly sensitive people"" but again, I didn't relate, and the books were mostly about general information and life advice, whereas this is a very specific problem.

I am always trying to help people and play the rescuer, but I get too caught up in their drama. This happens with close friends, family, and less close friends. I get caught up in their problems and I also get too bummed out or stressed out by their problems - even when their problems are not my problems and have only to do with them.

I don't know how to stop being so dragged down by other people's moods or so overly emotionally involved in their lives. 

I'm in therapy already for issues; there's just not enough time in therapy to address all of my problems, plus my therapist said that this issue will just take time.

But what things can I do in the meantime of time, because this is really annoying me.  ",08Sep2017,6
8,"My mom has been really sick for about 8 months now and she even got medical help and they gave her medicine and she still didn't get better, she got even worse. She tells me people are talking to her in her head and I don't really understand what is going on. When my parents got divorced is when she got even worse, she started smacking herself saying it's not true, it's just a dream, shut up. It got to the point where she didn't go to sleep for a while and she past out so I called the ambulance and they gave her medicine at the emergencies. When I went to go pick her up from the emergencies the doctors told me her heart was 3 times faster than what she had after giving her the medicine. After a while, I told my dad the situation and he came back trying to help her get better. My dad tried to convince her to get help from psychologists or psychiatrists but she doesn't want to since she lost her trust in them, she also thinks that witch craft is the reason she is like that.

10,"So... A bit of a backstory: I have been taking Focalin for ADD and Lexapro for Depression since high school. After graduating from college, I decided to stop taking Focalin, thinking that I didn't need it post academia. Three years later, I discovered that I have struggled in life due to focus related problems. After consulting my Psychiatrist, I've decided to go back on Focalin to again treat my ADD. 

Since starting today, I was able to focus on tasks without being severely side tracked. Overall, things have been okay. It was only night came and all of a sudden I've felt...off... 

I don't know how to describe it, but it feels like I've entered something like depression, yet very minor. I'm not sure it this is just me adjusting to my meds, or the Focalin reacting to Lexapro. Does anyone have any advice about this kind of situation.

11,"I apologize for the melodramatic title. I also apologize for the length of this post, but I would appreciate if there is at least one person on this sub that can read it and offer me some sort of advice because I am so lost right now.

I will start with a little background info. I have had OCD for my entire life, but around age 15 (over 5 years ago) I fell into a depression and was diagnosed with OCD (officially), and depression. I began taking 10 mg of Prozac and never noticed a positive difference in my condition. At the most I took 20 mg of Prozac for a few months before stopping the drug completely at 17. I am now 20 and have been off of medication for over 3 years. From 2013 until now I would say I have been into see almost 10 different therapists, and never stuck with any of them long enough to see results. I dropped out of high school at age 17 and have tried community college to little success outside of completing 3 courses.

For years now I have coasted through life not doing anything with myself. I am a miserable pathetic human being and I am painfully self aware, yet it still isn't enough to motivate me to do anything. It is so much easier for me to just eat and sleep my life away without having to get better. My OCD makes me incredibly impulsive and indecisive to the point where anything that I feel good about is extremely short lived, and I find myself in a place where I can no longer get excited about things because I have no idea how I am going to feel about it the next day. 

I am living in a constant state where I want to be better, but don't want to do anything to help myself because that requires too much effort. I find so much shame in admitting this but it is getting to a point where my head is in constant turmoil and I can't focus on anything. 

One of my huge OCD triggers are drugs and medication, and the side effects related to taking medication. It was the reason I would not progress further than 20 mg while on Prozac, and is the reason I won't even entertain the thought of medicine today. It scares the shit out of me thinking the long term effects it could have on me to take a antidepressant. On the other side of this coin, I realize that in my condition I probably will not get better without taking some form of medication. I just feel so stuck right now.


This post is a mess and I have no idea what I am hoping to accomplish with this, but if there is anyone here that can help me in some form I would greatly appreciate it. I will elaborate on anything that I didn't explain clearly enough in this post. Thank you to anyone that made it this far :)

15,"Hey people. I made this throwaway because I lost some things that were important to me, and I don't know where else to go. It wasn't anything physical, my body, or anything that can be so easily replaced or heal on it's own. Long story short, I spent 18 months after the death of someone I was very close to, dedicated to trying to help others. Instead of dealing with my own grief, my own problems, I put it off, and over the course of months I grew angry and bitter at a world I no longer felt I belonged to, forced to live on this earth where there is nothing left that I wanted to do(I'm not suicidal though, for personal reasons). Eventually I finally exhausted myself, and stopped trying to help others. 

I sought my own help in the form of a professional, and he helped me deal with my apparent inability to let myself feel emotions. That was months ago. Now, most everything is as it should be, but how i feel about people. I remember being sensitive, caring deeply but unable to let it show, typical shy behavior, but now, I can't feel anything towards others. I don't get crushes, I have no reason to make friends or go out with others, or even small interactions do nothing for me anymore. I look at other people, and the only thing I can feel is this void. I know I can still feel though, I feel happy, sad, I love being around animals, especially dogs and cats, but I cant feel anything with or around others any more, being around a mannequin would be more real to me. I need something to work with, I want to be whole again, I just don't know how.

 If it helps, I have been tested and have no mental disorders, but I do have schizoid, which was diagnosed by the professional.

20," As I approach my early adult life I seem to be developing more and more this void between other people. When I'm alone I am active, inspired and emotionally stable. I rarely feel alone when actually alone. 

 This all changes when I am around others. I can handle being around a close friend or a close family member like my sister or father but only for short bursts. Every moment I spend with others just makes me feel more and more alone. I don't have social anxiety and am not anxious around others. I just get this overwhelming feeling of lonelyness as if no one actually knows me. 

It may sound pretentious as fuck but I have no one around me to discuss the subjects I am interested in at the level that I would find stimulating. I obsess over Film and deeply analyze every film I watch, I love Philosophy and am currently reading Descartes Meditations On First Philosophy and have Plato's The Republic to read after that, I love History and obsess over certain periods of time like the Roman Empire and French Revoloution and I am increasingly becoming more interested in Physics (at a low level so far). I have also been teaching myself Italian over the past few months with slow but good results. 

 I'm not sure if it is just the fact that I don't have anyone who shares my interests to talk with so my brain is stimulated or if I have just lost the ability to connect with others. I find myself increasingly unable to deal with peoples emotions. I have always and remain the type of person who will sit and discuss someones problems for their catharsism and maybe it is because of my lack of emotion or rather suppression of emotion. I have recently gotten into a fight at my frequent pub over basically a misunderstanding. I remained clear headed throughout and even when I was being punched they seemed taken a back by how I was still attempting to calm the situation instead of becoming aggressive. I have learned to suppress and ignore all negative emotions such as aggression, lust, selfishness and the hunt for a romantic partner and whenever I see these emotions in people now I just lose a little hope for humanity.

 Anyway I have rambled on enough and I apologise for that. I guess I just needed some catharsism too. Does anybody know what I am experiencing? I was beginning to think I was basically developing into a Psychopath with no emotion or empathy but I still have plenty of emotions and a more than average level of empathy. So please if anyone knows the condition I am suffering from or have any ideas as to how I should proceed please let me know.

I've had all the meds I think.  Currently on Vensir XL 150mg and Pregablin 450mg.  They take the edge of me wanting to break down entirly.  I went off them a year back and had all 5 emotions in the space of a second I think.

I have heard over and over things like ""I wish there was something I could do"" and ""You'll be fine, talk to me when your feeling better"".  These in my eyes infuriate me.  I want if anything people to be closer to me when I'm down.

I've a limited social life.  Sill live at home with my dad and Brother.  My mum died about 10 years ago, suddenly, which was pretty messed up.  Things happened to me in school that I don't like talking about.

Basically, once people get to know what a Whiney little bitch I am they turn funny and ignore me.

I've never been in a relationship, I'd love to be in one, but at the same time would they just be nice out of pity or are there genuine people still about out there?

I have alot of trust issues as well as Social Anxitey, oh and Insecure about myself.

I noticed a cycle going on for about 3 years now. I get really optimistic and confident, make new friends and on the third day I'm practically calling everyone my bestfriend and feel like I can do everything. This period lasts for a month or two and then I gradually start feeling down and having an identity crisis (feeling like I am not who I project myself as and feeling like i don't even know who i am). One day I can admire and love someone and the next I absolutely hate them without them doing anything wrong. Then the cycle repeats.

We're both in our mid-20s and have been together for just over half a year. In the beginning of our relationship we went out a lot and would come back to my place fairly late. There was drinking involved when we'd go out, but nothing excessive. Just enough to get a little drunk and have a good time. On about 4-5 of these occasions, sometimes during, and sometimes outside of intimate moments, my partner would begin a sentence that was relevant to what we were discussing. Suddenly, they would begin to say incredibly incoherent things. For example, they begin saying, ""I love you so much,"" and end at, ""tell me it's from the tribe."" That entire line of speech would be unbroken and without me interjecting. I would let them finish in order to properly understand what was happening. After the 4th or 5th incident I insisted they go see a doctor, and it took some convincing. They told me it's totally normal and it happens when they're tired or under the influence, but I've never seen that behavior before in either scenario they mentioned. They saw their family doctor and the doctor said not to worry. I personally don't trust a family doctor's word as fact because more often than not I've found them loosely invested in mental health. I told my S/O that if the doctor would clear them, I wouldn't bother them any longer. My S/O told me the doctor said they're fine and I moved on. After that visit to the doctor's my partner hasn't had one of those incidents again which also makes me wonder were those incidents intentional, they felt my reaction was too much and so they avoid doing that. Or do they have those ""episodes"" now and again and they'll have another one of those again.

For a bit of context, I was walking to work in a large Canadian city. A few minutes into my walk, I noticed that a woman was following me (walking right next to me) and talking to me. She was speaking at a normal volume, looked like any other commuter, and was angry. I wasn't able to hear everything she was saying (as I was wearing ear buds), but from what I did hear, they were things like ""I know what you did,"" ""how much silicone is in your brain? Fucking disgusting,"" ""I know you stole $250,000 from the Netherlands,"" and ""I will turn you to dust."" Needless to say, I have done nothing of the sort. It immediately clicked that she must be experiencing some sort of paranoid delusion. I felt increasingly threatened.

I completely ignored her and did not make eye contact. I don't know where she went, but I managed to lose her after a few blocks. Friends/family/coworkers have told me that I should have called the police, but 
a) I didn't know how she would have reacted if I had reached my hand into my purse to grab my phone.
b) I was a little worried for her own sake (i.e. I know how police can treat people with mental illnesses, especially those experiencing psychosis).

My question is- how should I have reacted/how should I react if this happens again? I know that with people with dementia, you should never try to force them into YOUR reality, as this can be extremely distressing and agitating to them. I felt that this probably also applies to people experiencing psychosis, but I also felt that if I had engaged with her in this way (e.g. said ""sorry I did this stuff, I'll turn myself in""), she may not have taken too kindly to it. She was acting far more unpredictably than anyone I've met with dementia.

46,"I've been on 100mg Pregabalin TDS for over a month now (Diagnosis: GAD &amp; Mixed Personality Disorder: BPD with obsessive traits) 

I have noticed some interesting mood changes: 
*Speaking more slowly. People have noticed. I used to talk really fast and sound quite over excitable, and now I talk a bit slower. However, sometimes I can't find the right words to say and struggle to remember the right word, which I have never experienced before commencing the medication. 

*Feeling calmer. Things no longer seem like the end of the world when things don't go to plan or I have a misunderstanding with someone. I simply stay calm and think through what I need to say. I've been learning to take a step back before I say something I don't mean. I've had good feedback from those closest to me that I appear more stable and calmer in myself, and when I communicate with them. 

*Sometimes I feel really flat. It's like my emotions have all been flattened. I'm no longer dancing on the ceiling in delight, and can't say I feel happy even though I tend to come across to people as extremely happy and bubbly at times, particularly at work. However, I don't feel like ending it all or using self harming behaviours for very long either. The feeling passes rather quickly. 

*Impulsivity. The need to do certain impulsive behaviours has increased, however so is my capacity to use logic/wise mind to decide whether or not they are a good idea or not. 

There is a slightly more sinister side though - when things are bad I do feel like jumping off a bridge ( but then I did feel like this before also so may just be me) I do feel quite depressed at times but it is sudden. I was up and down before which is my norm, but now it's like the drop is so steep it makes me feel a bit worried at times. However, I feel MUCH more stable though in general. Before my moods were unmanageable in many situations in my personal life.

*My sleep is much improved. I don't sleep enough (long term habit) however when I do I sleep like a baby, and I actually look forward to my bed. 

*I've noticed that I bite my bottom lip every day now, however I am able to notice it and stop it - it's not involuntary but I do feel a compulsion to do it. I didn't have this before I started this medication and I do seem to move my mouth more than I did before starting the medication which is a slight concern. 

Overall, I would say that it's been life changing for me. I couldn't go on the way I was before, and this medication has allowed me to participate in my DBT programme (which I am just finishing) and make better use of it. It's had no impact on my OCD symptoms, however I am now more aware that I do them than I was before.

I want to know if anyone else has been on Pregabalin, and hear about their experiences.

47,"Like, a website or place to find worksheets, articles, free book downloads? I'm unable to see a therapist or psychiatrist on a regular basis atm. 

Also, I really really hate myself for soooo many reasons. A part of me wants to talk about it, but most of me is too exhausted right now. Trying to use the little bit of energy I have left to keep me from tipping over the threshold between ""functional depression"" and ""I-can't-get-out-of-bed depression.""",08Sep2017,5

50,"Hello, a friend of mine has recently started showing some rather disturbing psychological symptoms. He for no apparent reason started suspecting, that all his friends and his girlfriend are just pretending to be actual friends and that in fact he is mentally challenged (which he is not, he is a bright guy) and demanded his girlfriend to tell him that their relationship is just an act, so he doesnt feel bad for being retarded. He also said he cant tell what is real anymore and that he is never going back to his new job he recently started (which he was really happy about just a couple days back).

This is two weeks after we smoked weed and he has described he felt this same way while being high. However at that time, once he was sober, he was just telling it as a ""whoa I had this really weird high"" kind of story, still seemingly well aware it had nothing to do with reality.

I know that he cannot be diagnosed with any mental disorder on an internet forum after briefly describing his behaviour, I just wanted to know, how worried should we be? Should we get him to a professional ASAP or should we wait couple days if he gets better? Should we watch out for something? Do we need to keep an eye on him at all times for now? How serious you think this is?

**EDIT: for some reason this has shown as an announcment rather than a standard post - i have no clue how or why, if anyone can help me change that, please do.**

**EDIT 2: I have now read the sidebar :-)**

thank you for your replies.
