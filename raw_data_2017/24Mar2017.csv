0,"I don't know what happening to me but when I'm laying in bed trying to fall asleep at night I all of a sudden become very conscious/focused on my breathing and can't stop thinking about it until it gets to the point that I feel as though I have to ""force"" my self to breathe or I will not actually breathe. This scares, panics and frustrates me and I am unable to sleep at all. I am also unsure whether this is all in my head or something is wrong with my body- I am a 17 year old female (5'5 and 121 pounds) who is not on any medication. When I tell my parents this they tell me to ""just close my eyes and fall asleep."" Every day this week I have come home exhausted and ready to sleep but I just can't and I start panicking and crying in bed. It honestly feels terrible and it has been happening for two years now, it will stop and then start up again every once in a while. Any ideas of how I can stop this?

1,"I'm at an age where I'm a little too old to get diagnosed. Health service has effectively abandoned me, trapping me in a wasteland of offering me appointments they know I can't take and taking months and months to get back to me every time. I've accepted that my probable multitude of conditions and such will probably never get diagnosed and therefore will only continue to be a problem in my life until such time as they are no longer able to be a problem or I am no longer able to be affected by them. This is disheartening. Everywhere I look online is a scam or a fucking jesus pit. I'm a spazz and I don't know where to go. I don't know why I'm posting this because I haven't got a diagnosis so the internet says I'm mentally healthy. I'm so angry at them and I'm not sure what to do.

2,"My issue is rather a bit peculiar to elucidate. I shall try my best however, firstly, I never congratulate myself on anything or even act a bit proud(positive connotation to avoid any ambiguity) of my accomplishments. I understand and acknowledge the significance of humility but this is downright overkill. I always yearn to try my hardest but after doing so, I involuntarily tell myself that everyone around me is better than I am somehow but they just aren't willing to exert their utmost effort to prove it. This ensues a period of apathy that I dread soon after. My unintentional self-defeating attitude is perniciously affecting my social life and academics(I'm merely a sophomore). The worst portion is that I can't seem to control any of this(as I've mentioned all of this is involuntary). 

Deep down, I am cognizant that I am an intelligent person but its as if my brain is endeavoring to elude this factor. I personally see this as a weakness as my peers have begun to treat me in an imperative manner(while some are plain belligerent). I am utterly confused on how to revert myself back to my previous jocular, benevolent, yet ASSERTIVE nature(perhaps with a tinge of arrogance) I implore all of you to provide advice if pertinent.

3,"OK, this is the first time I encountered a real problem. I stared experiencing sleep paralasys few months ago. I first started taking antidepressans and antipsychotcs 2 years ago. I omitted some taking them few times from the schedule. I don't know if the sleep paralysis is connected with the meds. I don't know if it's connected with stopping taking them.

The last one a had few minutes ago, and it was the worst until now. I don't think I'm will sleep any time soon. Maybe never again (you can probably guess what that means).

6,"**[Update at the bottom as well as additional TL;DR]**
(Newest TL;DR at very bottom)

So for some short background on myself, I'm currently 19, female, I'm from Utah (if that makes any difference) and I've had severe clinical depression and anxiety for 11 years. I've recently found out I have several other disorders, or whatever you wanna call them. One that might be worth mentioning is PTSD. **(Edit: This doesn't in  any way include everything I have; I'm only including what could be important.)** I was in the hospital twice last September, and while the first experience was alright looking back, the second one was absolutely horrible. Because of the last experience I swore to myself that no matter how bad things got I would NEVER go back to a hospital, of any kind, for ANY reason.
What I need help with is kind of weighing pros and cons I guess. In retrospect the past four months have been unusually hard, and I've become incredibly suicidal. I've always struggled with being suicidal. Tonight, actually, I almost went through with it. My outlook on the world has never been flowery, cheerful, or enjoyable. This has especially gotten worse within the last three months. I struggle to even get out of bed and do something before 5pm, and I usually don't go to sleep until 5 or so in the morning. I've become even more cynical, hateful, angry and ""bomb-like."" I don't see any good in the world and I'm sick of other people and being alive. I know I need help, but I've been like this for a very long time, and I know it will be incredibly difficult to change years of thinking, habits, and beliefs. I've never had good experiences with therapy, and I feel the profession is a joke. With that being said, I think what I need most is someone to talk to and help me sort out my feelings - a therapist.
Before I get too far from my original point... I don't really know if I trust myself, and I think going back to the hospital could be a good thing. Why I'm hesitant, and almost reluctant, is because I freak out when I feel like I'm trapped and that's basically what happens at the hospital. I can't leave or do what I want when I want. I don't want to feel like a trapped bird, and have people look down at me (the staff). Another thing I'm concerned about is that I frequently vape, and I'll get sick if I can't. I'm worried that I wouldn't be able to go outside and vape when I need to. I also hate the entrance process, the whole strip search/check thing and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable.
When I left the hospital the last time, I had gotten incredibly sick and left in a worse mental and physical state than I arrived in. The staff were beyond rude and negligent, and I never got the care I needed. I think going back (to a different hospital of course) could be very beneficial, but I'm too nervous about all of the unknowns. 
Oh and I don't currently have insurance, besides insurance from my parents that cover doctor visits. I don't have a job, money to pay for being hospitalized, or insurance that would cover that. That's another hesitation I have. I literally can't afford to go into debt right now; I barely have enough money to pay my rent.

I guess before I ramble on before much longer, with all of taken into consideration, do you guys think it could be good?

TL;DR: Been incredibly depressed and suicidal lately, and I'm considering being admitted to a hospital again. I'm hesitant though, because the last two times I was hospitalized, were HORRIBLE experiences. I left in worse condition then I went in. I don't have money or insurance to cover the visits. Could admitting myself be beneficial?

Edit: I have decided not to admit myself, and I'm glad I didn't. I'm just going to figure out how to deal with personality and mood disorders on my own and hope it works.
Thank you to the one person who attempted to answer the question.

**Edit:** If possible, I need to ask once again for help with my dilemma. I'm coming to believe I need to go back, but with my attitude towards the human race as a whole and hospitalization, I'm not very sure it would improve my situation. On the other hand, I have no routines, nothing I enjoy doing. It's become a task to be alive and get out of bed, and I'm getting sick of this burden. Again my biggest concern is that I don't have insurance, I hardly have any money, and I've had deplorable experiences in the past that make me never want to return to any hospital. They may be able to temporarily ease my struggle, my burden, but I know it won't do much to help me long term. I hate how you are treated in those places, the lack of respect, kindness, and general human empathy. They act as though you are a horrible, plagued monster and look down upon you with disgust. And again, I'm NOT looking for resources or what you think will help. I am ONLY looking for someone who can help weigh the pros against the cons.
**Extra Edit:** I'm not worried, or concerned, about diagnoses. Words attempting to describe how my mind functions don't concern me. What I'm preoccupied with is my ever growing hate for our species, and the darkness and emptiness I feel everyday. I don't take pleasure in anything anymore, I hardly eat, I only leave my apartment to get groceries occasionally, etc. I want to actually enjoy doing anything, or being alive for that matter. I've spent the entire life I can remember like this. There's no quality of life here, there's not even living. Just surviving. Honestly, I'm sick of it and either want to end it or enjoy life. Whichever approaches me sooner is the one I will choose. Small side note: I apologize for the fact that this probably sounds very bitter and angry, and anyone reading this should know it's not directed at said reader. I simply have a very strong dislike for most people, and that comes across in just about everything I do. Regardless, I do apologize for any hostilities or resentment felt.

**Extra TL;DR:** Problems have popped up again, thinking again I need to visit a hospital, although very cautious and hesitant. Staff I've dealt with are horrible, ignorant even. I don't have insurance and I barely have any money. Could it be beneficial? *Only looking for responses that can answer the question of: could hospitalization be a good thing?",24Mar2017,2
7,"Okay, so, I ruined my life financially with a 1 year Heroin addiction that I finally managed to kick 2-ish months ago. My depression was already bad during and before the Heroin use but got so bad I couldn't really function anymore. I got through the H detox, after week or two brain felt back to normal post Withdrawal Symptoms. Most things came back: I could cry again which was nice (Anhedonia tho), still severe depression and anxiety because the shame, no money, fear and self-hatred. 

Anyways, there was one Withdrawal symptoms (no Dopamine) that remained; I had absolutely no appetite and was even repulsed by food. I've 'detoxed' off Opioids in the past and never had lingering effects. So it's been 49 days or something since I lost appetite; had maybe 6-7k calories over this stretch. I'm going to end up in the Hospital anyway if this doesn't change so I'll probably go within a week.

I was on no other drugs after the Heroin detox so it's not symptoms from some other withdrawal. Mom, being worried about how bad my state was, got me in with a free Psychiatrist a month ago. He prescribed me, after a lot of my input, a SNRI, Wellbutrin, Mirtazapine. The Mirt was my idea since I needed any immediate help and Mirtazapine is essentially an Agonist rather then reuptake inhibitor. Went and got the meds from store, took them instantly, kinda surprisingly had no noticeable side effects but also didn't feel any better. Well, it's been a month on the Cymbalta and Wellbutrin at high doses, and I feel no better. I've never had success with antidepressants - tried most SSRIs with and without Wellbutrin, Effexor and Amitriptyline. Never helped much if at all, even during the best period of my life when I had some self-esteem, bought new car, saving money, stable. Still extremely introverted with rejection phobia, anxiety (mostly social), and wasn't able to feel/act like an average person unless drunk or on Opioids. Still no gf because I'm so terrified of interacting when them and that feel is hitting me especially hard lately, though I'm finaly trying to improve via meds and therapy. 

My thoughts/memory haven't been great the past week or so - still function well enough but can't write coherently and forget details. Anyway, this is all so f-ing bizarre and the only thing that's ever afflicted me, not knowing why or even how it happened. It's like withdrawal from a Dopamine Agonist type anti-appetite. No way in hell it's PAWS from 2+ months ago, this is WAY too severe for that. I've been trying to force myself to eat a little the past few days, but I can't and it's not nearly enough for sustenance. Hospital seems inevitable now; not sure what they could even DO, but this is very very not good. I've lost a lot of weight obviously, it's been nice cause I got fat on Heroin and am down to a healthy, attractive weight. 

I don't know why I'm posting this - maybe for similar experiences from you guys, thoughts on how/why this happened, etc. All I god damn want is to be 'normal' socially, able to have a career, not constantly worry and hate myself. I've felt totally hopeless like never before and I don't have the time to go through the ridiculous Med types and combos. I've been 100% committed mentally to treatment this time, and think I'll be a far happier, social person than I've ever been. It's probably important to mention I've been using (at times heavily) alcohol, opiods, whatever else that makes me feel 'normal-ish' since 14. If anyone reads this, thank you in advance and we're all gonna make it, brah.

13,"I'm nearly 27 now and still live at home with my parents. i'm lucky and very thankful I haven't been kicked out of the house because I struggle with anxiety and bipolar disorder, so it's hard for me to get out and apply for jobs. my bipolar disorder is a lot more in control now, definitely get depressed but no longer suicidal. 

anyways, now I find my anxiety to be a lot worse. i have both GAD and social anxiety. both suck, but social anxiety is the main thing that's completely fucking up my life. my anxiety is so bad that i completely avoid applying to jobs in person. it scares me way to much and i nearly have a panic attack every time i muster up the courage to do so. i mainly just apply to jobs online because of this, and we all know that's not a very good way to get a job.

just getting out and applying for jobs isn't the only part that's ruining things for me. Although it's not often that I apply or get interviews, I've had quite a few interviews now over time, but I get so damn nervous during them that I'm shaky, my voice quivers, and my minds going a mile a minute so I can't answer questions well, and i tend to fumble with my words or stutter even though i don't have a stutter. one time it got so bad that i spoke like have a sentence of gibberish. not real words and then I had to apologize. So as you can see, i'm awful at interviews as well because my anxiety, so i never land a job.

i'll take advice from you guys, but the main reason i'm hear is to see what kind of medication helped you guys out. i've taken SSRIs for anxiety which only seemed to help with anxiety talking on phones, but did nothing for the rest of my social anxiety. I'm just wondering if anyone out there has had a great experience with an anxiolytic that isn't a SSRI, barbiturate, or benzodiazepine. i know drugs work different with everyone, but it'd be nice to know of some medications that I may be able to mention to my doctor and see his opinion on it. SSRIs are the only thing that doctors seem to push, but I've had no luck with them. I've taken prozac, lexapro, zoloft, and effexor.",24Mar2017,2

23,"I was recently confronted with the prospect that I could have Asperger’s Syndrome, after it was expressed to me without much rhyme or reason, it had been suggested by my driving instructor as she had taught someone with it prior and felt I had similar traits (this was unspecified).

Although it was not brought up by my driving instructor, I can only assume the driving instructor had a hunch and decided to tip of my mum, who clearly unprepared for this inquired advice from the girl I had been volunteering for over the past weeks, who then I assume, told people from talent match, leading up to an odd and perplexing confrontation. They didn't specify any action that I perform that gave them the impression, nor did they take any time to explain what it is or why they think I might have it. This leads me to believe it was rushed and I don’t I think the appropriate research was equated before bringing it up in such a fashion, It could be paradoxically problematic that if I do have it, I would likely not be able to process the situation applicably anyway.
 
This interaction was immediately proceeded by a strange interview about career options, not really giving me any time to rest after receiving the news. The four people arched around, looking at me, as I was slowly becoming more self-conscious about my body language and start to fear that looking away or being completely dismissive would somehow constitute anti-social behaviour. 

I could only find myself trying to read their language in which to figure out how much had been told to them. When questioned about my hobbies, I often find myself choosing to say football and dance, because they are the most common and socially applicable of my interests. Towards the end I noticed that at times I was being pinned to the singular identity of ‘football fan’. I wondered whether it was because they knew a common symptom of Asperger’s is having ‘restricted and specific interests of which you know vast amounts.’ Or maybe they just like football.

The way they spoke gave occasional slip to the knowledge that they were making assumptions. Which I worry about when approaching people and deciding to tell them, it can be reliving to suddenly have a word that labels your behaviour and to find out there are other people like you. Though it can be dangerous when done incorrectly as many can be susceptible to The Illusory Truth Effect, in which something said enough times will eventually be construed as truth in your mind. 

I can’t help but be a little irritated that they chose to snake behind me instead of asking me straight on from the beginning, and I'm perfectly aware that I act strange at times, as if I equate the mannerisms akin to a robot that watches and attempts to replicate human behaviour. I have been asked on a couple of occasions if I had ADD but never thought to get checked as I've never felt that it impeded in my life in any way.

I was reminded of a time with my previous driving instructor where he was non-saliently asking whether I had ever been tested for anything, and especially now, although initially upsetting, I can appreciate the honesty. Although it makes me wonder, as apparently there is something about the way I drive that makes me seem anti-social, or maybe I just don’t talk much because I’m trying to concentrate on driving.

It seems like something small blown out of proportion by the fear and unknowing of aligning someone with the autistic spectrum. As autism comes in such a wide spectrum it is difficult to cultivate how to approach the subject, or how someone will react, yet alone get to the point of diagnosis. Having read up, and done some research, I couldn’t relate to any of the stories I read, or even to see any correlation whatsoever. The symptoms often associate with an ‘inability to understand social cues’ and empathy. 

When I was at university I took on the role of chairman in a society of over a hundred people and went out with them every other night. I specifically remember having a convocation with the previous chairman in which I had become closely acquainted, telling me I got the position because I was always trying to make friends with everyone, and being told something like that by somebody I respect was incredible to me. I’ve even written and directed my own short films, both of these I hold dear as trophies of my overcoming anxiety, but even attempting to list my achievements, I think maybe I could be being over defensive by trying to convince myself I don’t have anything.

I struggle to seek the value of money or material gain nor did I particularly want a degree at the time, it just seemed to be what everyone else did. I often lived by the philosophy that memories are the most important possession a person can have. Spending inordinate amounts and dropping any work I had to go out drinking out of fear I could miss out. Drinking had given me inflated confidence as I was suddenly able to approach strangers, talk to girls and giving me a strong feeling of euphoria and pride for something I once found difficult. Maybe I’m an alcoholic, or maybe that’s pretty common behaviour for a university student. 
Ever since I was inevitably kicked out of university for not doing much work, I don't really feel like myself anymore, I spend most of my time locked up in my room watching movies and reading philosophy books to distract myself with ethics and existential questions larger than myself. I can see why people would be worried about me as I have never been particularly open, though I have always been quite relaxed and able to look after myself. Maybe I don’t go out because I’m anti-social, or maybe I just have no friends here and nowhere to go.

Another common symptom of Aspergers is requiring clear structure which I am not particularly fond of, I would happily uproot my life and move to Iceland without blinking, given the opportunity. I much prefer not knowing what is ahead of me and approaching new situations as they develop.

I am extremely appreciative of the life that I have, so much so I frequently do my best not appear ungrateful and I regularly find myself attain the attributes of a wooden stave restricting my movement and giving answers as short as possible in which to prevent adding fuel to the fire of tautological information hurdling towards me. I am incredibly happy to have people around that care about me. But trying not to seem ungrateful has lead more and more to an Inability to complain and just watching as other people talk for me instead.

I’ve always been fascinated by the popular notion that the majority of great artists have mental illnesses of sorts, which gives them unique perspective to make interesting art, and being on an art course at university for few years, it seemed as if everybody, including the teachers, wore these ailments as if trophies comparable to trading cards, and I could just envision them bragging: “I’m a level 40 autist with mild depression and OCD boosters.” 

I took numerous tests online just to check, none of which even came close to a diagnosable range, at this point, I’m about 90% sure I don’t have Aspergers. Though it is still entirely possible that I have some other disorder, even so, it just seems like creating a problem where there isn’t one. Even if I do have a disorder, I have never particularly struggled with any aspect of my life, nor have I ever been faced with a challenge that eluded me to the point of feeling inept. By definition, disorders can only be diagnosable if you have numerus symptoms and if they are ‘ongoing, frustrating impairments’. 

When I’m alone, I find I am occasionally teaching myself seemingly arbitrary skills in which to make me seem more interesting. I once taught myself to say the words ‘I don’t know’ in numerous different languages just so that when somebody asked why, I could jokingly reply “je ne sais pas”. And it took me three days to teach myself to solve a Rubix cube. I also can’t help but be intrigued at the idea of being a Rain Man style savant, though I’m probably pushing it. I’ve never had a problem with learning but I still find myself switching between learning large amounts, and creating great proportions of work, in a short bursts, followed by seemingly doing nothing and letting the world move intrinsically around me for large quantities of time like I’m in a Beckett play. Switching between two ends of a spectrum. Maybe I’m bi-polar, or maybe I just rest sometimes when I’m tired. 

“There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn’t true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.” – Søren Kierkegaard

As not to let emotional proximity shroud my judgment, I always try to take some time to think before I can take on advice in which to approach it objectively, though it has only been a few days since it happened and I may have sounded a little passive-aggressive at times. So I apologise if anything slipped through. 

Do you think I could have something? Or maybe I’m just weird.

27,"So I've been on prozac since I was about fifteen after a suicide attempt, and after some tweaking it's always worked for me. On it I feel much more stable, more easily able to face my problems. Off it, I feel like I'm a pingpong ball being slapped between trying to 'take life one step at a time with a smile' and being happy and normal, and being incredibly anxious and depressed for vague, silly reasons, feeling unable to break away from those feelings.


Now I feel like I'm off it again. I missed a good few days between renewals, but I've done that before and always been okay after a few days of being back on them. Not this time. I feel emotional, wanting to cry at the drop of a hat, and constantly bouncing between trying to tell myself it'll be okay, distracting myself or being anxious, terrified or depressed about the future and my chances at 'success.' 


I feel like I've already fucked up too much, like I don't have the strength or willpower to fix it. I'm twenty-five and I have no idea what I want out of life. 


I have a job as a personal caretaker for people with disabilities that I enjoy, or at least tolerate on the bad days, and it's something I care about. It's enough to pay my rent and bills and groceries and let me save up a little bit at a time. Part of me would like to pick up more hours, but I'm scared off committing myself to something I ultimately can't see through, especially where I'm already usually beat at the end of my work week. How people manage 60 hour work weeks frequently I can't comprehend - I struggle with 36. 


I'm heavily overweight. This is one of my main sources of that feeling of 'too late, can't fix.' I packed on a massive amount in college and regretted it ever since. I look into exercises and eating better, but I can never stay committed. I lack willpower, and then I hate myself for that, and then I get depressed and anxious again.


I'm part of a big chat group of friends, have a smaller group of separate friends who I used to talk to frequently but do less now (which does have me a bit nervous, but I only have so much social energy) and since November I have a boyfriend from the former group. In many ways I guess he's my first 'real' boyfriend - I had one online who I'm still friends with and care for, and my best friend growing up and I dated a while, but this feels more real. We talk about the future, actually have plans to meet in person next month. I'm happy with him, but also terrified I'm not right for him, or he's not right for me, or of just royally fucking things up.


I guess all these issues, writing them down, come down to a lack of commitment. I'm scared of committing myself to something in case I can't handle it and fuck it up, and because everything ends at some point. Because I feel like I'm not strong enough to keep anything going long enough to make decent change. If I lack willpower and strength to just function on a 'normal' level, why shouldn't I give up? Why shouldn't I just withdraw and mope and curl up in bed and cower until I work up the nerve to at least make one final commitment, permanently?


That got a bit dramatic. tl;dr, I just hate this constant bouncing between 'it'll be okay, chin up!' and 'listing suicide methods in my head like I did when I was first depressed.' I don't know what to do or how to make positive changes in my life, where to start. I should go to my doctor, but he's a two-hour bus ride away and dealing with him is constantly frustrating. (One of the worst-rated doctors in the city, and it'll be months if not years before I can get another.)


I feel helpless, weak and stupid, and every little thing is frustrating me and making me teary. No idea what to do. I should be a goddamn grown-up and pick myself up by my bootstraps, but just that thought itself makes me want to curl back up in bed and ignore the fact that I exist for a while.

I've also been having some trouble breathing since starting (currently on day 2), but I've also been spring cleaning so it could just be dust in my home that's triggered my asthma. How common is the difficulty breathing side effect? Should I be concerned? 

The Trazodone confuses me since I was specifically given it to help with sleeping problems, but I can't see anything on the paperwork about it being used for that. Everything just says its anti-anxiety, with a side effect of difficulty sleeping so like... What. 

Buspirone HCL confuses me the most. I'm supposed to take it as needed whenever I'm anxious, up to 2x/day. But it also says to make sure I take it on a consistent basis, and not to miss a dose. How am I supposed to schedule a dosage of something that's supposed to only be taken when I specifically need it? I can't preemptively know when I'll have an anxiety attack. (Edit: just remembered after posting this- why can't you eat grapefruit while taking this? What would happen?)

If anyone has experience with these, could you clear up my confusions a bit? Also, if you've used any long term and could tell me what to expect, that'd be awesome. 

Thanks in advance! ",24Mar2017,1
31," I'm debating on leaving this world this evening. I've been at an alltime low for the past 2 years, I keep on getting more pills for my mental health. Not to long ago I started hearing voices, and everynight I stand by a bridge or the train track and thinking and I've had so many therapist and I've called so many suicide lines so I hope the community I love, can please save me in these dark times.... (I know I've done alot of shit posting in the past, but please help me)",24Mar2017,1
32,"Lately I've had this tendency to think that I'm very smart, and then be crushed when I make a stupid mistake at work, probably due to cockiness. I'm wondering if there is some type of thought exercise I could use whenever I notice myself being in my own head about my intelligence. I either think that I'm very smart or I think that I'm very stupid. I want to try to find balance. ",24Mar2017,1
