7,"I'm curious if someone can explain to me exactly what is happening in my brain/body. 

Prior to ever being prescribed medication for adhd, I was full of energy and never had any symptoms of depression/anxiety. I feel like the minute my doctor and I started ""playing around"" with medications and finding one that worked for my adhd is when other symptoms started to occur. I was in high school at the time, and she didn't really ween me off of one before we started another. Did this mess up my brain and cause other problems? 

I know ADHD is usually connected to depression/anxiety but I don't understand why.


Also, on days that I don't take my medication or if I run out, I could sleep ALL DAY. I'm completely out of it and incapable of doing even the simplest tasks. I was never like this before taking medication. Is this in my head because I'm comparing how I feel when I'm on it... or is there something that is actually causing me to ""crash"". 

When I bring up these things to my doctor she just kind of brushes it off and says its normal but I'd like to understand why.",07Mar2017,2

11,"Hi there,

I've known I've had a general anxiety disorder for four years now after my GP has diagnosed me. Three other doctors there agreed, and I visited a therapist who helped me learn skills and ways to manage anxiety as I refused medication from my GP. I've been offered medication six times now and I'm starting to wonder if I'm holding myself back from a full happy life. But that's not just it... I'm starting to wonder if there is more than anxiety holding me back.

I suffer terribly in college. I cannot work no matter how much I try. Study tends to be me struggling to focus on one topic and then procrastinating. I leave everything last minute and then get upset, disappointed in myself, stressed and angry. I hand in work that I know is not up to my standard / doesn't represent my intelligence. Most days I get ready for college, dressed, makeup, backpack packed, and then lie down on bed. i cannot make myself go in.

I don't know what is wrong with me. i don't feel particularly anxious anymore and have left therapy after six months. I feel calm to an extent, or sometimes full of dread, but I think my problem is attention. I cannot pay attention  or work. I just can't DO things. I don't understand why I can't DO college work when I LOVE reading and learning.

It's been fourish years since I've actually worked hard or well. I am starting to think I will fail to graduate college, and I'm just a first year. Could I have an attention problem? Is something wrong with me? I am unhappy often and feel terribly trapped.

WHO do I go to for some diagnose or help?
What could be wrong with me?

tl;dr: who or where do i go to to get help and a diagnose? ",07Mar2017,1
12,"I've recently begun counselling (in my third or fourth weekly session) after dropping out of university in May (due to resume elsewhere though) and being in my worst depressive state until about October, when I got a job and was prescribed some antidepressants (Mirtazapine, 10 or 15 mg/day) . I'm now working in the meantime until I begin university. What are peoples experience with counselling, did it work or did something else (in lessening the impact of your mental health on your life/ability to be a functioning member of society)?

It's been helpful in letting me clarify my thoughts about issues in my life and thoughts I have e.g. feeling anxious around my family due to internalising the feelings of being unfairly shouted at, and also not blaming myself entirely for something that happened that led to me change university. Something I also don't like is that I don't know where it's leading to. Also not sure if it's helping me. My anxiety and depression aren't rational so I'm not sure I can think myself out of irrational thoughts - I already know unhelpful thoughts are unhelpful but that doesn't make them go away

13,"I write a lot of fiction and I get invested in what I write, I usually try to capture the spirit of my life in my texts. The fact that I write so much kind of made me live inside a bubble with myself and my feelings and now that I got out of it for school and such, I feel empty, like I lost who I was. I feel like a shell of myself, I lost empathy for others, I lost motivation to do anything. I fell in a state of permanent carelessness. I still write, but my themes have been getting darker and darker. I tried writing comedy, watching happy stuff, going out with friends, but it's not the same as it was, it's like if I didn't feel anything. I'm not sad, I'm not happy, I'm not angry, I'm nothing. It really bothers me, I'm stuck in this kind of weird void. I always liked being sad, I think sadness is beautiful and poetic you know, but now I can't even be sad. I can't be anything. Anyone might know what this is ? I highly doubt that it's depression and I'm nowhere near being suicidal, I'm just empty.

15,"
I am looking for advice on how to maintain empathy for my mother. As long as I can remember, my mom has been both overtly mentally ill (severe anxiety, and impulse control issues, as well as occasional bouts of semi-suicidal depression and bizarre paranoia) and someone who assumes the physically sick role with gusto via a combination of true hypochondriasis and over-the-top complaining about real, but non-dangerous ailments. She's never been abusive but my childhood was characterized by emotional manipulation and since leaving home 17 years ago I've found I can only get along with her sometimes, though I do love her very much and wish she could be happy. Over the past many years, her overt behavioral issues have become a bit more muted, but in favor of severe somatization. There is always something making her feel sick but never anything obvious to me, my father (a doctor himself) or her doctors despite enormous workups. She constantly has a new symptom to report, and her newest thing is a horrible stomachache triggered by getting in the car to go somewhere, unless she is the one driving. She rarely will do anything fun with my dad or me when I am visiting because of these issues, though she is able to go on long road trips on her own to visit doctors with no problem. She talks about her physical issues nonstop, and wistfully says things like 'if only I could live in [beloved upscale resort town] then I would be well at last.' Though able bodied, she seems to depend on my father for almost everything (like, if my dad is home, she'll call him over to flip a light switch next to her or pour a glass of water) when he's around and most decisions seem dictated by her ailments. If you bring up anything related to illness or death, she becomes dramatically distraught at the idea that she has so little life left, what with her ailments, despite only being diagnosed with minor and typical age related diseases and aches all requiring minimal or no treatment. She's been like this all my life but has worsened so much recently. On one level I know she can't help it and she is suffering from this and likely truly does experience the symptoms she develops via somatization of her mental health issues; but it also seems like if she could magically be free of all 'illness' she would be completely bereft. I am fast losing my ability to maintain my empathy for my mother and find myself mostly just wishing she would get over herself and feeling anger (my favored coping method recently has been chewing on the insides of my cheeks when listening to her) and I know I am often short with her. I've known her long enough to know that she will never change; instead, please tell me how I can change my attitude before my relationship with her goes to hell completely.

19,"I have insurance through anthem (blue cross blue shield) and I'm trying to find a decent psychiatrist/therapist in the Portland area.

I'm trying to avoid naturopathic quacks and people who think medication is the devil, which seems to be commonplace around here. I was with a great doctor about 3 years back who worked with me and found a medication combination that got me employed, healthy, fit and functional, but after I lost that insurance I haven't had a doctor since that was willing to prescribe me the same medications.

Right now I'm seeing someone who is a little too syrupy and coddling and I don't feel like I can talk to them, so I am trying to see if anyone here has someone they really clicked well with who is willing to consider all treatment options. I have had several severe traumas in my life and am working to mitigate that along with severe anxiety and depression as well as an unknown (but diagnosed) sleep/brainwave disorder.

all of zoom care apparently is unable to prescribe any kind of benzodiazepines and a number of other medications, so I feel frustratingly trapped by lack of treatment options as I am being cycled through the same useless drugs over and over. I'm already practicing every behavioral changes/breathing exercises/etc. ad nauseum so I'm not looking for 'try yoga' or 'eat healthier' or anything like that because I've been through it all (but thanks).

I know this is long winded, I've just been going through this for so long that I'm giving up hope that i'll ever find a doctor like my previous one and would really love some recommendations as I dig through all these doctors. Thank you so much in advance.",08Mar2017,1

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression early 2016 I also have really bad self esteem and I got put on a mental health care plan but Iv havn't achieved anything with my psychologist I feel like every time i go im wasting my time, i feel uncomfortable, i dont connect with her, i only see her for 10 sessions a year which is very little as its on the plan and im 17 and cant afford to pay for therapy and I don't see the point, I had a session today and she said that i'm ""hard to read' and that I always seem so put together, she thinks i'm doing ok and that i wont need to see her much longer just a catch up hear and there but i'm honestly getting worse I have been so down and sad most of the time since school started I have cried at least 4 times in every class because I feel stupid and worthless and if I don't get 100% i'm not happy I got a B+ on my first biology test and I was so disgusted with myself and like I suck and everyone is better and Im a burden, the anxiety is doing my head in and Iv started self harming again for the first time in 3 years and I have no clue why I just want to do it (iv only been doing this for 2 weeks) but I told her I was fine and Im honestly so glad I don't have to go to therapy anymore I have always wanted to be a psychologist but now i'm starting to think therapy is a bunch bollocks and a waste so im really conflicted. I also don't know what the heck to do I wont tell my parents any of this I HATE them being involved in my life especially emotionally and I also am really depressed about how even if i need help 10 sessions a year wont do much and I need more to connect with someone and I cant afford the sessions and neither can my family it just isn't possible and the fact that my family is struggling with money and I don't have any stresses me out. I also have a lot of relationship issues with my step dad and dad so that causes lots of fighting. even my body issues are getting worse I honestly am disgusted by my reflection I cant look in the mirror in the school bathrooms because I look so fat and gross and weird looking.

24,"My mother has had some anxiety related issues in the past, as well as some other physical issues. Our family is politically divided (dad and I are conservative/libertarian, mom is liberal) but we've always had relatively civil political discussions in the past. However, after the recent election, any slight reference or joke about politics (specifically regarding President Trump) triggers a full blown anxiety attack in my mother. I first dismissed this as an overreaction to her candidate losing, but have come to see these anxiety attacks as resulting from larger unresolved issues. What would be the best way to deal with these problems? Should we just avoid talking about politics, or should I try to get psychiatric  help for her? We live in the US btw.",08Mar2017,2

38,"I am generally a happy person. I don't have depression, I joke and laugh a lot.

That being said, I have a tendency to get angry and frustrated over trivial things. My parents are the same way, they get mad if something doesn't work, if someone doesn't understand something and so on. 

I am trying really hard to figure out where does my anger come from but I genuinely don't know. If I would I could solve what bothers me and fix it but I am happy with my life and I wouldn't change a thing. 

If I don't get upset about something trivial (something breaks, I loose something) then I get upset with the system or injustice  (in general, not towards me speficially), things which are beyond my control. And I am aware that world does not own me anything and it is the way it is but it still bothers me.

What might be potential causes of anger and how can I fix it? I always remember being this way, even as a child, I was sweet in public but very angry in private life. 

I tried to change my perspective into 'looking at the positive side of things' for years but I would be lying to myself if I would say that I truly believe that. I tried meditation, yoga and so on but nothing works.

Something stupid set off my anxiety attack last night, then I thought about what set it off last time and made my current attack worse
Sometime I have urges to do stupid things or hurt myself or others.
When we got a new mini pony home the end of last summer, i had the intrusive thought of killing him by stabbing a knife into his heart. How easy it would be and how I could just go to the barn at night and do it. This thought plagued me for a weekI love this pony more than anything
And would never hurt a hair on his body. I have spent along time gaining his trust and just sitting with him petting him. He is one of my best friends. I feel anxity and guilt that I had theise thought. And the fact that most of my urdges last less than an hour usually less than 30 min but this one lasted a week. I could never in 19999999999 years bring myself to act upon any of these urges. Sometimes the urge could be hitting someone with a hammer or screening profanities during church or breaking a new phone. They are utterly the most repulsive weird and fucked up things I can think of.  I have had urges with the other horses, but none of the lasted as long as the ones about the pony, this makes me sick.  I reached out about this before after I had a massive anxity attack from the guilt. I learned I'm not alone, why they happen, and how to deal with them. Apparently they are a survival mechanism leftover from ancient times so woman don't kill their baby's and communities don't destroy each other. It is like the brains checks and balances. A repulsive idea arises, the brain is discussed by it, and the action is not carried out. Basically a natural sanity check. I also learned a lot of people have these thoughts, albeit some people not as strong as others. I heard the best way to deal with them is not to pay them any mind and let them pass because they feed on anxiety. I still feel like a fucked up person who deserves to be punished. What's wrong with me.

44,"So as the title says I got out of a shitty marriage 2 years ago.

I was with her for 10 years and in that time she cheated on me multiple times, threw things at me (the largest being a laptop which she then demanded I repair), took money from me, refused to work or do housework, bullied me into an open marriage, belittled me in front of my friends, told me I was shit and hit me when her temper flared. She also was pregnant and miscarried and led me to believe for 4 years that the baby was mine which absolutely destroyed me because I was under the impression that I'd lost a child.

Somehow she would always convince me it was my fault and I'd come crawling back to her.

Anyway long story short, I managed to get away. It's been 2 years, 2 months and 3 days and I still see her in my mind every day. It doesn't help that every two weeks she has supervised visits with my son that I have to attend.

I've been in a happy relationship with a great woman for about a year and a half. Lately though I've been getting a lot of old feelings popping up that shouldn't logically be there.

My girlfriend hasn't changed. She's very nice, doesn't cheat, doesn't hurt me, barely ever raised her voice. But lately any time I suspect that she's not having a good day or when her monthly visit from Aunt Irma happens I can't help but flinch.

I keep worrying that I'm going to wake up from a blissful dream and find myself in the same nightmare as before. I don't want to wake up. I'm speaking to mental health services and they seem to think I am doing fine and that I have terrific emotional armour but it doesn't help me sleep at night.

Sorry if this seems confusing. I'm very confused myself. I'm very happy in my situation but it just feels like my past keeps nipping at me. Reminding me that it's still there and never letting me forget.

There's been a few guys lately coming out of a situation similar to mine who have been looking to me for advice on how I got out relatively unscathed. I want to help but I don't feel like I recovered as much of myself as everyone seems to think.

And before anyone asks. No, I'm not thinking about suicide or self harm. I just want to be able to move on with my life, sleep well and enjoy what I've accomplished without constant thoughts of what I used to live with.
