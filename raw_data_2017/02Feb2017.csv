0,"OK so this all happened between 6pm yesterday, and about 1am this morning. This is not made up, this is what happened to me.
I began feeling tingly and strange around 6pm, I got tingly and it felt like something was pushing on different parts of my body. I ""realized"" after a while that I was possessed by a demon. It's hard to explain how I got to this line of thinking, I'm sober in recovery and take psychiatric meds. But anyway, it was as real as anything. It started getting worse, some examples:
-I began trying to get on my phone but the keypad only let me type 666. no other number worked. 
-There was a strong pull on different parts of my body, when I asked a question, my head would feel heavy and nod or shake. 
-I saw a phone move across a table away from me
-I began to think that the only way to get help was to recite prayers, hail Mary's and our father's and the serenity prayer. I'm not religious, never have been. I began gooogling exorcism prayers.
-this whole time I'm in a house with a few other people, but I didn't let anybody see cause I didn't want to get locked up in the mental ward. I new all this was crazy, but I couldn't dismiss the evidence I was seeing.
-there were too many instances to count, a Buddhist statue waisted it's hands to me. lights turned red, the fan light flickered, papers moves, all this was as real as this phone at the timw.

I acted normal and went to an AA meeting, and for the entire house I was battling this demon in my head sitting perfectly still except when I'd twitch from the mental strain. Long story short, I talked myself into realizing none of this was real. I was seeing demons on the floor and in the air near me. I'd describe them as things HP Lovecraft would dream up. But sanity prevaled. I had strong strong hallucinations till I fell asleep, small monsters on my body, spiders in the window. I just focused on my phone screen till I passed out. I was fatigued but fine this morning. I don't know what happened to me. please help.",02Feb2017,3,

3,"I have a history (since I was a kid) of anxiety and depression. I've been told by a couple of medical practitioners to look into therapy after they commented that I have a lack of affect. 

The problem is that I also have a history with therapy, and it's... unpleasant. I wrote something stupid for class that got me landed in therapy that I never felt I needed. I was resentful and paranoid that the therapist was reporting everything I said to my parents. Also, when driving my home, my dad would ask, ""What did you talk about today?"" which just furthered my suspicions.

Eventually, I was allowed to stop going, but after that if I misbehaved it was like a threat: ""Do we need to send you back to therapy?"" Usually the misbehavior came from my frustrations that they weren't understanding me, so I felt that they were the ones at fault, so when they sent me to another therapist- and put me on antidepressants at 11- I interpreted this as a punishment.

Now, I have some of the same issues following me around, but I find the idea of going to therapy traumatic. It's like admitting I'm not acting right for society, and I have to go get myself fixed. Objectively, I know I'm not okay- I'm anxious, I feel vaguely guilty over nothing specific, I have difficulty getting excited, I don't sleep well,  and I have difficulty motivating myself to do things. I just don't know how to get over this roadblock.",02Feb2017,2,

9,"So lately I've been depressed. This is a recurring thing from 2014, from when it vanished and came back in earlier 2016. 
All I do is sleep, eat junk, and think about dying all the time. I know I have a problem.

But the problem is I hate psychiatrists. They always seemed so condescending to me, like bad listeners, and like they just see you as a paycheck. I never saw one that didn't treat me like my problems were trivial and/or didn't just say ""mhm"" every fifteen minutes without offering any insight or help. 
Not only that, but I don't want to be that guy who was so weak they just couldn't handle their poor feelings so much.

Is there any place I can go for help that isn't a psychologist or loaded gun?",02Feb2017,6,

13,"Hi there, I'm not 100% sure how to start but I tend to ramble so I'll try my hardest to keep things short 

I feel like a constant disappointment. I have high expectations of myself and so do my parents since I'm an only child and they're such hard workers. Neither of them have dealt with mental health issues in the past (their words not my judgement) and so when I was diagnosed (after along time of invalidation) they were very confused. In my childhood things were very strict and I was constantly walking on eggshells around them, juggling keeping my dad happy (which has made a lot of weird behaviour for me now) and getting good grades. 
One abusive relationship later and leaving school and 5 years of suicidal thoughts and attempts later; I am an escapist, constantly making up lies as to why I can't do certain things so I can stay at home and be cool and do errands from here.
I have depression, anxiety, ptsd and mildly autistic
I feel like I'm a terrible person, particularly because of my escapist behaviour (I've stayed at my boyfriends house for a month and visited my parents twice just because it's so tense being there sometimes even though things have calmed down) and often want to self harm (but have promised not too due to partner) 
I am not financially independent, despite trying my absolute hardest to get a job, and every time I see my parents that's the topic of conversation for at least an hour and, despite also pursuing higher education 
When I go over there they say how much they miss me and both want constant affection and I feel very overwhelmed and tired much faster than I do for normal social interactions, probably because of how tense my childhood was (my dad would stare at me angrily from the couch if I walked into the kitchen and quietly got myself a glass of water because I was being too loud) 
This breaks my mums heart and I don't want to do that, I don't like that I feel so tense and can get snappy just from feeling so much more exhausted than I do with any other social interaction

I just way to be left alone and not feel like even if I walk into the house and talk proudly about what I'm doing with education and looking for work, they'll bring up something I haven't seen or haven't thought about and by the end I'll feel like a failure who hasn't even been trying. 

Despite currently getting ready for school, mum wants me to get a full time job since the reason she thinks I'm not getting hired 
This is despite me telling her at my last full time job (while in abusive relationship may I add) I constantly wanted to die and on multiple occasions considered overdosing at my desk. 

They help me financially currently, well my mum and it's in secret, for me cleaning the house. I don't want this situation any more and need to be more independent

I just I feel like a bad person and my brain is so sick with constant chatter and terrible self esteem and body image ranging from stuff in childhood to how (dad saying he could see my cellulite in my shorts at 11 and mum often having car talks with me on the way home from school calling me fat)

My partner helps all he can but I don't want to worry him with all that's going on in my brain, even though he's the one person I've been the most honest with. 

I am even considering smoking at 2pm just because I had a long and intense session of dreams (I don't usually sleep through the night but have 3 hours of sleep and awakeness) where I usually woke up completely emotionally drained and shaken from a horribly tense situation happening in dreams for 6 hours where I was unable to wake. This happens sometimes and it can cause panic attacks and for me to not want to get out of bed until late. But today I was okay but my back feels an old type of tense that it needs something to calm it down more and my coping mechanisms haven't helped.

I just
Idk why I'm here
My brain is constantly chattering and I smoke weed to calm it down 
It doesn't make any sense and everyone has said that
I need a job but I've been unable to get one
I've been working as hard as I can and no one will believe me
None of my friends want to talk to me anymore and none of them even want to help me fundraiser the worlds greatest shave by even giving two dollars
My favourite thing is staying inside with Juna high meanjng I can enjoy the simplest things in life without worry 
I just need some kind of help
I've gotten into disordered eating again where I won't eat unless I'm high usually 
I just feel like I'm cracking and don't know what to do even though I'm trying my best 
Help?

14,"  I know many look back at their highschool years as less than smooth but damn mine would make a lot of people feel better about their own. My self esteem/respect was absolutely non existent and was walked over like crazy. The type of kid that didn't defend themselves at all in bullying situations. Somebody wanted chips in the cafeteria? I bought them because I was to nervous to say no and then was usually emotionally battered by said person after, but all I could do was laugh. There was actually a time in class where a girl, younger than me btw, had to stand up for me because I couldn't work up the courage to do it myself. I also went through an awkward streetwear phase which looking back made me lool even more ridiculous. After I graduated and got further away from the school and certain kids I became a lot more aware of the shit I was put through. I think this mostly has to do with going to college and being treated with a grain of respect from people that never met me. I have a level of self respect now and can and have told people off when they insult me now, But damn looking back at the person I used to be makes me angry. Almost like another form took my body over from 6-12th grade and I slowly watched as my life crumbled into an awkward mess. Should I consult a therapist about this anger? Is it normal to actually hate one's past self? I'm not suicidal about it or anything but I almost want to beat the shit out of my old self for essentially ruining the best era of my life.

15,"Not sure if this is the right place but I figured I would post. I hope that I get feedback.

First, I'm bipolar. 

Second, okay...I will explain the best I can.

I was walking my dog today. I could hear a car behind me slowly approaching so, like always, I moved towards my right (with my dog). It was a cop car. But it was all black and no signs on the car. I know that cop cars can have faded logos but this one had no logos at all and the license plate said 'exempt'. I saw the backseat of the car (were you couldnt get to the front if you wanted to, like a fence). But I also did not see a shotgun (like there should be one). Also the 2 male passangers were both white but I cannot remember their faces. Anyway.....I was walking my dog and they veered around the corner, and when they went around the corner with my dog they were gone. And there is no way they could have just went bye-bye. Also, before they turned the corner there was a loose dog that they slowed down for and the owner (female) called for it and the dog ran towards her.

Am i going crazy? Was the cop car there? Cop cars have to show they are a cop car but this car didn't show that. Was the dog and lady real? I'm so confused. I'm coherent and in a right state of mind but I don't think the car existed. An all black cop car with no markings on it but everything else was there....can this happen? can a person literally make this up ? ",02Feb2017,1,

19,"Hi,

I am a regular person in mid-twenties, working a job, ambitious.

I've been living with anxiety, or recognized anxiety, for 6-7 years now. For a very long time, me, my friends and family believed I'm just a person who gets angry easily.

Took everyone some time to understand that my anger stems from anxiety.

In fact, a lot of my personality stems from anxiety. Over years, I've been able to channel my anxiety into being productive and felt very proud of doing the same, until I realized I was simply living with high functioning anxiety. 

Well, better than low functioning, right? 

I'm seen as a slightly bossy, dominating person. Most people who don't know me well enough thing I am an extremely strong person, who always has things figured out. 

Well, in some things, I am. Professional things mostly. In personal life, I'm pretty far away. Quite the opposite actually. 

I know some people in professional settings who think I'm too ""chill"" to get angry. Real angry. Dominating is different. I'm the ""chilled out"" dominant. 

But they haven't seen me. There are only two times I've had a fit of rage in public, (kudos?) mostly misdirected, caused by my own issues, taken out on something or someone else. 

I've lost people each time. Even some people I was particularly close to. They could never understand because it wasn't easy to understand. Because on the face of it, I was a strong, independent, fierce, sorted person. What I was actually was just a high functioning anxious little hypocrite who lived the opposite way of what I depicted and propagated. 

After losing people, I get guilty. Guilty enough to hate myself. Guilty enough to cause myself more anxiety.

""What if they hate me forever? What if I do this to everyone I love? What if I lose everyone? Does anyone really get me?""

I have nightmares, seeing similar things happening. Me getting aggravated and angry, even in the dream I wanted to control myself but couldn't. I woken up crying and feeling more guilty. 

I've frantically told people what happened and how guilty I was to seek their forgiveness and approval. I needed an approval to be happy, to calm down.

I write this as I was recently told my behavior is some form of PTSD. Post traumatic stress disorder, for the uninitiated. The trauma of causing a spectacle of oneself, of not being in control of yourself and of losing a friend. The stress of doing the same all over again and losing more, or all, of the people in my life. 

I never thought it was PTSD, because to me, PTSD is something that affects war veterans. But apparently, a trauma is a trauma. 

I write this today to probably help anyone understand their guilt and anxiety. To help a person understand a friend who is behaving weirdly. 

And to see if I am the only one here. To feel better with the hope that more people like me who are living their lives. It will sound like an approval to carry on. Afterall, us anxious ones love an approval, don't we? :)",02Feb2017,4,
20,"I'm turning 27 in about a month and within the past six months it's become blatantly obvious to me that most of my friends and coworkers have some sort of mental illness or at least a mental health problem of some kind. I don't just have one friendship group, I have a bunch of different circles of friends that are all unrelated to each other, and some who are overseas. But an alarming number of them are suffering from depression and/or anxiety, PTSD, bipolar and personality disorders, which I'm aware some would argue is not a mental illness. I think it might be something to do with the age I'm now at. It seems like my peers and I are reaching an age where things are solidified, like personality traits and bad habits and tendencies etc. I know everyone has their battles and demons and stuff, I know I certainly do and that I have my own mental health issues, but things just look really bleak from here. I'm wondering if anyone else has ever thought the same thing about their own peer groups? How did you feel about it and how did you handle it?",02Feb2017,5,

26,"When I don't talk or get my mind occupied, I ruminate. Is there any medical term for this bad habit if it is considered disease in itself? If there is, I will do a research and see what I can do.  

I ask this question because rumination exacerbates my low self-esteem, and has caused depression. A lot of people feel insecure in one way or another, but they don't get depressed because they don't think about them a lot. It happens to me to some degree as well. If I can keep talking in a casual way most of the day, I would think my disadvantage is not a big deal. 

So I think I should work on rumination first.  ""Distraction"", as prescribed by psychologist, can work to some degree but cannot uproot it. Looking for something that can totally change me. ",02Feb2017,2,

40,"I had a girlfriend of 5 years that I loved very much. We often had issues because she was not very expressive which her, her friends, and family would admit to. She's an amazing girl she lacks communication and connection skills but maybe that's my fault? And I feel did a lot of narcissistic things without realizing. i never have been able to put my finger on if me having an issue with it is on me or her but Im realizing especially after my two quick and short relationships after that I have narcissistic tendencies. I do have a fragile ego and one thing I learned after the first was that I needed to remove my ego but once I was loved by the next girl all that went out the window and in being afraid these might not work I did have backup plans. I would say Girls do like me and in these two last relationships I found myself boasting a bit about other girls liking me (which I realize could be just me trying to reassure that I am desirable after feeling so rejected by my long relationship failing after so long). 

This last girl, I realize I went at a super slow pace and didnt consider her time or feelings at all. I truly didn't mean to do this. I do like her alot. I also loved my 5 year girlfriend. And I screwed it up and I see myself not able to progress internally as long as I have this black cloud over me of hurting everything I touch without even realizing. I lack empathy and my thought is often ""my actions can't really hurt them"" And I do treat them nice but is that for my own benefit? Something I do to get love? I do want them to be happy I just don't ever feel from their perspective.

I can go on about this but I don't want this to go on. I want to maybe never date again. I don't want to hurt anyone or myself ever.
I feel my intentions are good but I know NEED to change my mindset. I can't live with myself like this I hate it :l I feel like i've felt these are normal behaviors. This society praises bad men and I hate being one. I want to feel secure in a relationship. Without fear of ending up alone for committing. 

Does a narcissist ever feel remorse? Is the remorse I feel real? I often think I'd be better off dead but then part of me feels I can be the best lover and am super curious about success and a happy life of helping others. Would a narcissist feel extremely bad after realizing he is one? I feel terrible and I want the people I care about to know I love them.

(Sidenote - The first I can remember narcissistic behavior was When I was 11,  and with the terrorism going on in my country (USA) I had trouble understanding got a lot of anxiety, became distant and lost all my hair. I was bullied and depressed because I was a completely bald 5th grader. The only thing that saved me was standing up for myself and being a huge rebel and being SUPER confident/ cocky about myself. I found that I still became popular and attracted the girls in my class even with this condition and that made me feel normal.)",02Feb2017,2,
41,"Hello, 

I'm sorry for not putting this somewhere more specific but I don't know if there is already a DSM diagnosis for this.

Essentially when I'm really upset or stressed I can essentially just stop feeling. Like a switch I flip mentally, no more anger, the stressor is still there but it doesn't matter. If I was feeling sad then that's done too. The typical downside is that it seems to be an all or nothing thing until I come out of it. I won't feel happy or excited for about a day either. I've tried to be happy again but it just doesn't come.  The switch analogy falls here because I can't seem to turn it on. For most of my life I'd say my (socially) positive emotions have been on the weak side while my negative ones are strong. That is to say I'm quick to anger and slow to joy. 

 I'm not sure if this is normal or not. I've had a few sessions with a therapist, but the first couple were getting to know each other and we didn't get to this before my insurance stopped covering them.

I'm not expecting professional advice, just an ear (or an eye I suppose). It is hard to admit these things to people close to me, so anonymity on the internet it is. Thanks for taking the time to read this, even just putting words to it is a relief.",02Feb2017,1,
