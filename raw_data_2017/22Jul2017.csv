0,"We are recruiting for ​a research study on daily emotion awareness and stress! Increase your emotional intelligence and reduce stress by participating in the EmoTrak World Tour study.

It’s simple: the primary mechanism for stress reduction is the moment-to-moment observation and reflection of our emotional episodes.

EmoTrak, a smartphone delivered, evidence-based mindfulness intervention for stress reduction, was developed by researchers at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine who have collaborated directly with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, to help increase participant’s resilience to emotion amid their busy schedule.  The researchers behind Emotrak recognize that common mindfulness interventions require many weeks of intensive training and practice, a commitment that is simply not possible for an overwhelming majority of the population.  

There remains a critical need for the translation of mindfulness practices into easy-to-implement, technology-assisted interventions.  Drawing upon the wisdom of East in conjunction with Western science, Emotrak provides both training and assessment that can fit within the limited pedagogical time available for our busy lives. 

 
You may Qualify if you: 
 
·  Are at least 18 years old and English Speaking 
·  Have an IPhone 
·  Can commit to responding to texts twice a day for two weeks. 
 
As a Participant, you would: 
·  Receive an Emotion Tracking App developed at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine. 
·  Take short surveys before and after you track your emotions on stress, resilience and wellbeing. 
·  Receive a report of your daily and weekly emotional experiences. 
 
Please email emotrak@ucsf.edu for more information about the study. ​

i have really bad paranoia (especially at night), but my therapist says its caused by my anxiety. 

i'll definitely bring this up with my therapist next time i see her, i just want to see if this is normal or not.",22Jul2017,3
2,"Hey friends,

I could use some help.

I'm in a very committed relationship with a man that I am pretty sure is my soulmate. He is the *best* thing that's happened to me; he encourages my work, my curiosity, inspires me to explore the world around me, has introduced me to deep political, psychological, and, I guess existential (? for lack of better word) conversation. We click on so many levels it's basically disgusting.

He comes from a broken family, has suffered abuse, and struggles with generalized anxiety disorder and suicidal thoughts - and I have no idea how to handle this.

I wouldn't change a thing about him, and I'm not looking to ""fix"" him - he isn't broken. But coming from a very close-knit family and having dealt with no such things myself, I have a very hard time understanding what it's like to be in his shoes - and I feel like this makes me a liability to his own mental health. My anxieties are superficial, but hinge on losing loved ones. The idea of walking this planet without him by my side is insufferable, and so when he's in the midst of an attack I'm so sure I make it worse. I'm either overbearing and breathing down his neck, or I'm trying to stay calm and I think this makes me come off as aloof.

And.... for the record, I know it's *so* not about me, he's the one in crisis, as it were.

I talk to him about it (when he's out of crisis) often, and bless every ounce of him he's always so willing to answer my questions. And I know that I can't help him, that he has to help himself, but I'm sure you guys have some advice for the helpers in your life. Anything - literally anything, it does not matter how small - that people do that help you get through the day, please share.

With the caveat that we are a long distance relationship, and so being in his physical vicinity is often an impossibility.

He is not a burden. I love him to the ends of the Earth and back. We have plans - really good plans - for our future, and we're serious about them, and good days are *good* days... but the bad days are bad, and you guys, please, anything that can help me understand his headspace and help make the bad days less bad would be so very appreciated.

Thanks, reddit.",22Jul2017,41

4,"For around a year now, I've had about 4 short instances when my personality has changed from my usual self to someone that enjoys violence. I've written things and then looked back and been frightened because it was like a different person was talking and when I switch back or whatever I have this weird feeling like something was swiped away or lifted out of my head. When I am emotionally distressed or sometimes at random points in the day, I will hear a thought that isn't me saying things and it's like a different person but the same one each time and it's been with me for a couple of years now. My current theory is that it's that voice or whatever taking more control at random intervals and changing my mindset so that when I'm typing and messaging things I'm basically a different person and like things like violence that I wouldn't normally.

I have anxiety. I lose sleep. I create mental scripts so Im not as often surprised... I obsess over past moments. I am especially sensitive to overhearing gossip or even productive talk about other people.

Im seeing a psychologist, but I havent developed helpful self talk yet. I also think I need to be on a daily anti-anxiety rx, not just Lorazepam in certain cases (I get too spacy and forgetful).

How do I cope? I feel like I embarrass myself for every cringe worthy, or awkward, or not ideal moments.

Unfortunately in time I realized I lacked two of those traits, and now I realize I have none of those traits. I also wanted to date very beautiful girls, but now that goal is also a distant dream to me. So in order to keep myself going, I need to think very aggressive blood thirsty thoughts, or lose myself to a   self-induced adrenaline rush. In these moments I feel spontaneous and that anything could happen, that maybe I can attract a beautiful girl's attention, or that maybe I can finally some-how attain the intellect or strength I wanted. However in the end I realize that all of this is a fading illusion, I will never accomplish any of it however I still feel joy, a joy that I get from imagining myself dead and everyone abandoning me it's like some sort of fuck-you to myself and life, me for being stupid enough to try and be a good person, and never attain anything I want, and to life for lying to me and telling me I can get all the things I wanted.",22Jul2017,1

11,"Bullies (Walk a Mile)

I take all the shit they throw in my face 

I'll fake a smile and stand firmly in place

Pretend everything's okay and I'm happy

Because no one bothers to stand up for me

I'll wait 'till I'm alone to break down and cry

So no one can say that I don't try

I'll put on a brave face, say everything's fine

But I'm bleeding out inside

And no one sees the pain I'm in

And when I break down they said I let it win

They don't see the constant internal fighting

They don't see how hard I'm trying

No one can see the struggle that goes on within

The horror, the ache, the confusion

The argument between the voices in my head

And you all wonder why I wish I were dead

It's so easy to look down and criticize 

When you can't see the world through my eyes

So how about you put on my shoes and walk a mile

And then see how easy it is to smile

The very first step will break your toes

And every other bone with constant worries and woes

And when your gasping for breath on your knees

You'll look up and finally see

And understand the demons inside my mind 

All the hurt I've felt you will find

And you'll take the shoes off and look up at me

And realize your insults were not free

But rather came at an enormous cost

The cost of covering my heart in frost 

But will you ever apologize?

Will you ever amend the lies?

The hurtful words spewed from your lips

Poisoned my soul like a toxic kiss

And as the tears stream on down my cheeks

You'll look away to find your peace

In the ignorance that says no one's in pain

The ignorance that no one can go insane

That says your words have no lasting power

On the people you shun as cowards

But you are the ones who live in fear

Holding those desperate thoughts near

That you could never cause someone to end their life

That your words truly cut like a knife 

And refuse to accept what's obvious and true

That the world is bigger than you

12,"Does anyone else get this? What do I do? 

I face mental illnesses and their complications - then to add on, I've done many things, lost many people I care about, driven many away with my behavior, gotten into severe depression and ruined my education, ruined my job with autism, and then I face the guilt of it that worsens my mental illnesses. Cycle over and over. I miss people so much, and it is my fault. Any good thing I try in life is stopped by OCD, autism, depression, you name it. 

Thousands of times, I've committed harm or have had severe thoughts of just ending it, no point in going on and gaining more pain. But the thing that truly stops me is the need, the obsession to see how my life turns out and what it all comes to as I age, who I end up with, what I end up doing, etc. But then, with all that has happened to me, my paranoia and anxiety and shame kicks in and reminds me that this is not a movie... and there is a chance that I will never make it out of my stupid hometown, get a good career with the shitty job and schooling I just barely passed through, or find someone who actually cares about me and isn't using me/playing games and is not turned off by me.",22Jul2017,2

1. I really love cloudy, foggy and rainy days. They are awesome! I really love the night, too. What I really hate is sunshine. I don't know why, but it makes me feel depressed. And I have no clue why! This feeling I get is low motivation and general feelings of sadness, because I think about certain situations too much (for example me missing my childhood). So, does anyone had this problem already and how to combat it?

2. I have OCD since 2 years, but what I saw is that every time I take Ibuprofen my OCD reduces by 90%. But because I don't want to take Ibuprofen too often (and thus I don't want to get used to it), what could I do instead of it (to gain the same anti-inflammatory effect which i would get from Ibuprofen)?

3. Also since 2 years, my concentration and memory gets lower. Nowadays it's sometimes hard to read something correctly because I can't concentrate enough on the letters. Also I don't or hardly remember what was yesterday for lunch e.g., its like something is wrong. Another example for low concentration is that i don't see that i should make space in a full bus because some persons want to get in, i have to be told to do so. 

4. I also have a very light sleep, I need something to put into my ears and a sleep mask to sleep somehow, but it is not enough because it is still too bright for me or because I can smell something from the kitchen

I hope someone can help me at least a little bit

 The reason I'm posting here (and not in a relationship sub) is nearly a year later I keep thinking about him.  I wake up and go to bed with the same horrible feeling of regret.  Intellectually I know we weren't right for eachorher and I should move on but I can't shake these thoughts.


 Haven't exactly dealt with this breakup well.  Relapsed into some drug use (under control now) and depressive symptoms.  Between that and the inability to focus (obsessive thoughts) my career has really suffered.  Been demoted to night shift which doesn't help with the depression..  Its all I can do to get myself to/from work, otherwise I'm pretty much just laying at home crying.


  Long term history of depression/anxiety and substance abuse.  Things had been going well for years until this breakup and now I feel stuck.  CBT has been helpful in the past but not now.

24,"Hello, I hope you are all doing well! Maybe you can help me.
A sum-up: My Mom is diagnosed with depression and has been in therapy for a while, she's doing well and is in good, professional, hands but it's still a constant balance act for her to feel good about herself. - Just for context.

My Dad is easily stressed out and angered, always reacts overly annoyed and agressive to things my mom or anyone does. His Day consist of: Working, going home, watching TV and eating crap.
Anything else than just laying on the couch is stress to him. He doesn't cook like he used to, he doesn't clean the house, he let's the garden overgrow, he is agressively angry at the cat for being sick and puking all over the place but avoids taking her to the doctor for 5 month straight because he ""has to just relax sometimes"". Everytime I ask him how his day was, what he did or what he has planned he says ""just hanging out."" and then, without any input from me as I really didn't judge that or think about it until recently when I was home for a longer period and saw the dimensions of his way of life, he starts apologizing for not doing anything - saying things like ""Sometimes you just have to relax you know."" . ""You know I work 10 hour days, I'm drained after that"" and so on. He get's so angry when he has to do anything besides laying around. Last time I visited home it was planned for months that he would pick me up at the train station. When he did he started on a rant about how he worked all day, barely got to change clothes and now has to pick me up - lowkey blaming me for having him pick me up.

It's a sunny day, no stress, good mood and we park second row to load a couch up - didn't find a parking spot - and there he goes out of nowhere ""This is all bullshit again, fucking bullshit"" - ""What? There's Room to pass us, it'll be fine"" I said. ""anyway, we are right here, i'll just move the car if something happens"" - we walk away from the car and ""fucking shit, always this shit"" &lt;- Seriously now that i write it down it's even scarier to me. He really isn't happy! 

Also he started working two years ago, was a househusband the 8 years before that. When he has holiday he smokes weed from 9am till 1am which is scary because he is a dry alcoholic and it's really aching to abuse now with the weed. He always smoked, hell I smoke sometimes, but he's overdoing it to a point where Mom and I wonder why he does it, what he's trying to cope with. We're never passive agressive towards him though, when something comes up we all talk about it freely.

It's not that we think he should stop being lazy or that he should take care of the house or whatever. It's never been that way in our family. I just really think that he has a mental problem and is unhappy.

Also my parents are very much socially isolated - when I talked to my father about this he said ""I see enough people at work everyday"". He is a very intelligent man, he understood that this probably is the definiton of being socially isolated but he doesn't care to admit it. 
What can I do to help him? Am I overstepping boundaries if I tell him what concerns me? Anytime I tried he got angry so I didn't push it. 

tl;dr - Mom is depressive but she's getting help. My Dad is always angry, socially isolated, easily stressed out and agressive but doesn't realize it- What can I do to help?

Gosh I'm sorry for the long post and I'm afraid I sound like a demanding asshole ranting about his lazy dad but that was not my intention. 

Any help would be appreciated, even if it's just sending me to a ""help center""or something.

Have a good day everyone!",22Jul2017,2

I think because in the past I've been really hurt by her

She would be dismissive about my feelings, judge me, invalidate, etc. 

And if I'd share that, she would just defend herself and not always apologize, or continue to do the same thing

It's hard though because you can't just ignore someone when you're living with them and depending on them. And being unhappy is like being ungrateful. I've been given so much materially. But material things are all going to pass away.

But I physically hurt when I share things with her
My body is telling me something. I need to keep things to myself. But my mom is useful. She helps me, she gives me money, etc. Without parents to fall back on, I wonder if I can survive. But I don't want to have relationships with people who don't give a crap about how I feel.

And yet, as much as I want to end it, my fear of death stops me. Even though I find breathing everyday to be a constant chore, there's nothing I can do. My life is nothing special to me. Nothing would happen if I were to die. Time continues to flow forward. I have made no impacts.

I know that these all interact with each other, but my main focus for this post is on her anxiety.

Here's more you should probably know in order to help me. She is also super introverted and thoroughly enjoys not having plans or doing anything. For example, on days that she works at 2pm, she absolutely loathes the thought of waking up any earlier than she has to in order to get ready for work. She'll avoid scheduling appointments and other things for even like, 11am, because that means she'll have to wake up earlier than she absolutely needs to. I think this is related to her anxiety and depression. She's told me that even getting out of bed sometimes is one of the hardest things to do.

Her anxiety causes her to almost immediately think the worst of any situation. She's been cheated on many times before, and she says she trusts me, but any mention of a girl or me interacting with a girl drives her anxiety through the roof. I would never cheat on her, of course, but telling her that doesn't do much of anything because that's what previous boyfriends (who have cheated on her) have told her. She knows me and trusts me, and even if she knows or is friends with the girl, in her mind she thinks that it *can* happen simply because it's happened before. Is this the anxiety running rampant? Or has she simply learned from bad previous experiences? How do I reassure her? How do I ease the anxiety? How do I help her?",22Jul2017,1
