0,"Hey guys so I recently got into a car accident and that sparked my anxiety to come back pretty hard. Although I haven't had a panic attack in a week or so, I am noticing myself thinking about myself I a coffin ? I am suffering with derealization it seems, and this all doesn't seem real to me, although I am ""functioning"" on a daily basis. I catch myself impulsively thinking about whether I'm here or not, it doesn't matter because this all isn't real. I feel almost emotionless towards everything. I don't know if I'm making sense but I'm trying to understand why I'm thinking this way and how to stop these impulsive thoughts. They seem to get worse and worse and I don't know what to do with myself. 
I'm thinking it could be depression. I just need help on how to move forward from these terrible, terrible thoughts ",02Aug2017,1

2,"Hey, I recently moved to a new state where I don't know anyone to escape a physically abusive relationship. Not even a month after moving, one of my very best friends killed herself with an exit bag. I drove down (18hrs away) for the funeral where my ex was attending. We slept together. I'm worried I will never do better. 
I am living in a studio apartment that I can barely afford and now my car is giving me trouble. I used my HSA to buy food, which I think is technically fraud. I never feel like leaving the house. I can't afford an AC. I've gotten fat.

I hate myself. I hate my life. I don't want to exist anymore. I will never be out of debt. I've been depressed for so long, I don't even remember who I am anymore. 

Tell me it gets better or that you feel the same. I'm not asking for advice. I think I just wanted to tell people semi-anonymously, so no one can get alarmed or judge me. Thanks.",02Aug2017,1

14,"My wife seems to have a fair amount of verbal abuse from her recently diseased step father.  She was used as a laborer, probably talked down to a lot and had to be brave at a young age.  This has made her a brave, strong woman with a solid work ethic.  Her go to emotion is anger, it is her defense mechanism.  If she is hurt, sad, uncertain she just displays it as anger.  I can see through this and it doesn't affect me but it affects her.  

The big thing is that she devalues her self. If she told me something in passing for example and I asked her what did she say she would quickly come back with 'no one listens to me' or 'what I say isn't important' this sort of thing never stops.  We have tried for a second child 'because I am broken' she will say. 

This goes on all day every day, never a positive word about herself.  Is this a problem? How can I help?

17,"hey hey so just as a disclaimer thing im fully aware that ppl on here cant diagnose me. im just looking for some opinions

im an 18 year old girl and i think i might have OCD?? or at least i feel like something is up with me. I have taken many OCD screening quizzes and they advised me to ""seek professional help immediately""

I DEFINITELY know that i have really bad intrusive thoughts. They range anywhere from violence to religious to sexual related and i have pretty much no control over them at all. Once i have the thought in my head I can't make it go away and it just keeps repeating itself over and over again. that definitely means i have the ""obsession"" part in the OCD im pretty sure

the thing is im not sure if I actually have compulsions?? whenever i read accounts of OCD the person usually has some repetitive actions that they take because of some very distinct fear they have. With me though, I don't feel like I really do that? I definitely exhibit ""evening up"" behaviors like for example if i step on a crack with one foot i have to step on a crack with the other foot in the same place or else i feel wrong. its more than just that though, if i notice something brush up against me on one side i have to touch the other side of my body to feel right again.

i have this thing i do in car rides where i tap the window every time we drive past a sign. i dont know why i do this but i do it all the time. when i was little i was convinced i was going to die young. i wanted to go to the doctor and have them test me for everything just to be safe. Im not a huge germaphobe i feel like but i cant touch anything in bathrooms. Even when i pull off a sheet of toilet paper to use, i throw out the first couple sheets because the last person touched them. 

whenever i'm eating food, i don't eat anything that looks slightly different? I know its stupid but i always feel like someone is trying to poison me (a chip with a mark in it or a darker piece of cereal for example). when i get my intrusive thoughts, i get paranoid that the people around me can hear them. i thought (and still lowkey kind of do) feel like im a little psychic? i have thoughts pop into my head and a lot of the time someone nearby will say that exact wording out loud, no matter how obscure the thought was. once again, i know this is stupid but i cant shake the feeling

i get irrationally afraid of people in my family dying while doing kind of normal activities. there have been a few (rare) instances where i've been so scared i felt like my heart seized up and it got hard to breathe for a bit just thinking about it

Also on the topic of thoughts, when i have those intrusive thoughts i feel like i can physically feel them on my head. my head feels itchy and i have to brush at that part of my head so that no one else can ""hear"" the thought that was on my mind

when i was 12, i had a friend tell me that devil worshipers have ""666"" carved into the back of their hands. my family is super religious which i think has contributed to my religious intrusive thoughts but now whenever anyone mentions anything related to demons or the devil or anything, the backs of my hands feel kinda itchy and like theyre burning. 

i just dont really know what to do?? im sure theres more than this that i cant even think of right now because to me it feels normal. a few years ago, i went to a therapist to ask about OCD but i have a really hard time opening up to people and im very self conscious abt all this. i just ended up immediately crying and talking about other things in my life (not OCD at all). she ended up telling me she thought i might have depression and anxiety (but she couldnt officially diagnose me bc shes a therapist). i never went back to see her again bc its was so so expensive.

basically!!! i think i have some ocd tendencies but some of the paranoia stuff kinda reminds me of schizophrenia?? or something im not sure, i just wanted to hear someone elses thoughts

--I posted all of this above stuff on a different forum earlier and ""schizophrenia"" was tossed around a lot in the replies so I thought I would add on a bit more relating to that. 

I took some quizzes which all told me I have ""moderate"" symptoms that could be an early sign of schizophrenia. I'm just definitely paranoid. Some other things I remembered are that my memory feels like it's been getting worse, my attention span is getting worse, I don't take the best care of myself all the time and I don't really like going out much at all. 

I'm leaving for college in 2 weeks and so I had to set up a bank account. My moms name is on the bank account and for some reason I'm paranoid she's going to take all my money. I have no reason to think this really but she's aware that I'm kind of nervous and I'm pretty sure it's hurting her :((

also when reading about schizophrenia I came up with the idea that schizophrenic people are all the ""aware"" ones and the diagnoses and medications are just trying to control them and hold them back. I'm pretty sure this is a big red flag when it comes to schizophrenia ahahhhhh the thing is that I KNOW it's completely irrational but I just still feel like it could be true!!

He's focused entirely on my anxiety, and instead of trying to help me with my self harm, gave me an alternative that has just allowed me to hurt myself in multiple different ways now.

I don't see him again until next week, and I'm just in such a bad place that I don't even care that I only ate one meal in 24 hours, or that my thighs are burning.

21,"My husband was just checked in to an inpatient psychiatric unit.

He has bipolar disorder. Over the last couple of years he has been becoming less and less stable on his long term medication. 

In March he began experiencing overwhelming suicidal ideation and took a leave of absence from work on his psychiatrist's recommendation.  He has already exhausted a long list of medication options, so he received electroconvulsive therapy from the beginning of April until a couple of weeks ago. It helped for a while, but if he went more than a couple days without a treatment the suicidal thoughts would return, and the cognitive side effects were severe and distressing for him.

He is terrified of inpatient treatment, and I am on online student so I'm always home, so he has been home with me through this whole thing. He's never alone for long, and I have any medications he could use to overdose locked up.

But today he got worse. He was having mixed mania symptoms. He was impulsive, agitated, and his thoughts were racing. Most of those thoughts were about how to kill himself without me being able to stop him.

He communicates his mental state with me really well, so we were able to talk about whether he would be safe at home with me. We agreed that he probably would not be in his current state, so I took him to the emergency room.

After 9 hours he was transferred to an inpatient bed.

Now I am home, alone, and afraid that I made a mistake. 

I don't know what to do or how to help him.",03Aug2017,3
22,"Hi! My name is Ethan, and I'm writing a show that I'm going to direct at my high school next school year (2018-2019). 

A brief summary: The main character is a high school student who (still looking for names) has an imaginary friend from hell. This imaginary friend showed up when she was in kindergarten and has stuck around since. She basically brings her to the point of wanting to end her life. She is about to do it when her best friend barges into her room and he stops her. This is when the MC starts having flashbacks about her life with this imaginary friend (imaginary enemy I guess) and how she screwed up her life. 

Now, here's one of my problems: I can't pinpoint which mental health condition my MC has, if this is even a real one at all. At first, I was leaning towards Schizophrenia but after doing some research I'm not entirely sure. 

This is where you guys come in. I want this show to be as consistent and as close to life as possible with the problems that my MC faces. If anybody could help me figure out which mental health condition to diagnose my MC with that would be great. Also, if anybody has said condition and would like to contribute any personal experiences that I could use or draw inspiration from for scenes in this performance, I would really appreciate it. 

Thank you for your time. ",03Aug2017,1
23,"Last year I saw a psychiatrist and she gave me some antidepressants and a mild antipsychotic. One antidepressant gave me trouble peeing, the other two had potential side effects that prevented me from taking them. You know how the feeling of restlessness and discomfort? The AP made that feeling worse to the point of being painful and torturing.
Then I went for an ADHD screening and I got every diagnosis except ADHD.
I showed the letter to my psychiatrist, she looked at it, and said I need to see someone with more experience than herself. Probably for heavier medication. She gave me a referral. That's it. I slowly stopped medication and stopped visiting any professionals. I did try another AD but it made me puke and made my pulse go through the roof.

I'm not sure what to do. I am functioning enough and I don't have the courage to suicide. There is nothing to worry too much about except that I feel terrible about being alive most of the time. Not sure if that's reason enough to play around with serious medication with side effects.",03Aug2017,1

28,"Hey guys. Does anyone know if there are any tests that can see if your brain is fucked up in any way shape or form?

6 years ago, I was indulging myself in heavy marijuana use...after one evening of smoking a blunt (could have been mixed with something else for all I know), I had a huge wave of negativity pass over me, and I felt as if literally ""broke my brain"". My emotional centers were fucked, I couldn't smile or laugh, and my anxiety towards just about everything was at an all time high....

Anyways I've been pretty much clean since, but it's been an upward battle of trying to reinvent my brain. I think I've done an amazing job up until now, but I'm starting to go through some tough times mentally , and I'm starting to doubt myself. Even though I've done alot of work, and I'm proud of myself for doing so, it still has been incredibly hard rewiring my brain to happiness and a state of feeling good. Even now I can admit that life is definitely a lot harder than it should be.... So combine that fact with who I used to be and how easy life was prior to this ""accident"", to who I am now, constantly fighting and working to fix myself, and I'm starting to wonder if there is legitimatelly something wrong with my brain that can be medically treated. It's super tough to rewire your brain, and if there's something physically noticable about my brain that can be treated if identified, it could possibly make my progress a little more successful and easier..

I don't know if doctors can even see what's wrong though. I did some research and it seems as if my frontal lobe and limbic system is what took a hit. I guess my question, is can a CT scan, or any other brain imaging for that matter, show if there is actually something physically off with my brain that resulted from drug use (mainly marijuana)? If it can, and it's not purely psychological, what can I do, or who should I talk to to see what's up? Sorry if this doesn't make any sense. I've felt off for the past 2 weeks, and I'm just curious if anybody has any insight about this situation.

I am a high school junior in the US, and am looking for some words of wisdom about medical leaves from high school. Some background info is that during the third trimester of my sophomore year I had to take a modified class load(completing some classes as pass fail, and incomplete on others, some unaffected) because of mental health issues(legally disabled by them). Throughout the process my schools counselors assured me that this would not be viewed negatively by colleges. However I have began to worry that despite what the schools counselors said, that colleges will view this poorly and put me at a disadvantage compared others. So my question is am I crazy for thinking that I am now severely disadvantaged in the college application process, or are my counselors right?

I would love responses from people who have had to withdrawal  from highschool then later applied to college. Or from those who have an idea of how the US college system works.

Feeling trapped and overly stressed I decided for the sake of myself and my family it would be good to talk to someone. At this point I was having panic attacks daily and feeling worthless so I an appointment with the first person I could find. Big mistake.
My first visit was fine, because I did most of the talking and we were just getting to know each other. Second visit red flags started coming up right away. He did ALL of the talking. I barely said anything...not on my own accord. He would ask a question here and there but it was mostly to agree with what he said. Told me a few life stories. But here is what disturbed me the most. He said if I wanted my son to be raised to be a good person I can raise him Catholic, but if I wanted him to be a successful person I should raise him as a Protestant. First of all...I was NOT there for religious advice. Second of all, what brought the subject up was that my husbands mother gave him ""catholic guilt"" which was an issue in our marriage in the past. That's it. Through past experiences we actually have issue with organized religion. I told him this on our first session. Not atheists by any means, but not interested in joining a church either. So I had 1 or 2 more sessions after that. He repeated the same stories/advice each time. I brought my son on the last visit as I didn't have a sitter. Well, this brought up his parenting preaching. Then the same tag line came out of his mouth about Catholics and Protestants. That was it. I was done with this guy. I wasn't getting anywhere and frankly felt betrade. How I don't know but it made me feel uncomfortable, and I'm not a confrontational person especially at the time. I had made one more appointment, but after stewing for the week decided I wasn't going to go. I cancelled that day, letting him know that I didn't think that he was the right fit for me.  So he charged me the $50 session fee...that I still haven't paid...not even calling me back to find out why or if I was okay and found a new therapist, which yes I did. So now 2 months later I still can't get his actions out of my head...between not listening to my thoughts and giving me the same advice and telling the same stories over and over, to the religious comment.

55,"Don't know if it is the right place to ask, but I just had some tests because I have serious problems mostly with concentration and inability to notice things (errors at work, surroundings, etc.)

Psychologist that was carrying out tests for me concluded that I also have below average mental activity.

Does anyone know what that means and what I can do to improve my condition?",03Aug2017,3
56,"My name is Courtney Otto. Would it be possible for the government to prevent people from telling me the truth about certain things, through enacting strict penalties like death or life in prison? I feel like, even with these penalties, someone would tell me the truth, so such conspiracies are impossible. I have believed them in the past, though. ",03Aug2017,1

58,"Okay, so to start off, if this is in the wrong subreddit. I'm sorry but this seemed the best place for it. if it breaks rules, ill move it. 

im a 20 year old guy and lately i just haven't felt anything romantic or sexual for anyone at all for about 2 years now. and its bothering me. i feel like i should feel these things. also just as another detail, i have severe depression and anxiety. back in middle school and high school I definitely felt these things and asked out every girl i had even a slight chance with (yeah i was that guy) but then in like sophomore year i realized i had to stop that and i did and slowed down for a while. still had crushes but rarely acted on them. then i had a girlfriend. we went to senior prom together, had sex and then a month later she moved to the other side of the country and we broke up the day she moved because we didn't want to try to do a long distance thing. but since then i just haven't felt anything at all. at first i thought it was just heartbreak but it didn't go away. I'm over the girl. but i still don't feel attraction to anyone. I'm a photographer and a in life drawing classes to get my fine art degree so I've had beautiful naked people in front of me and i just felt nothing (even though i shouldn't anyway because its unprofessional) i even briefly considered that i might be gay. I'm not. 

i asked some friends about this and they don't seem to know either. they don't think that my sexuality would just shut off out of nowhere, another thought that back in my ""ask every girl out"" days, i was just subconsciously overcompensating. and i really don't think a breakup with a girl would just shut down my entire attraction to the human race.

so what I'm asking here is for any advice. or help anyone can provide. or if i should go to a therapist or psychologist or something to get professional answers. thank you for reading this and thank you for any help or advice anyone can provide.

TL;DR: i used to have attraction but i don't anymore i think. i don't know. plz help",03Aug2017,1
59,"Guys, I've beginning to feel it. Physically. No longer mentally or emotionally, but yesterday as I was driving my kids around I can almost feel my skull caving in two. I just wanted to stop everything I was doing and cry or let out a barbaric yawp or something. It didn't help that we're in the middle of a heatwave and i lost it on my kids when they refused to get out of the car as I was standing in a 105 degree blacktop.

I don't know what to do. I've last been gainfully full-time employed in 2009. Since that time, I completed graduate school, my wife & I adopted our niece with attachment issues and had another child, completed an AmeriCorps service, purchased the home we were renting (didn't qualify for conventional loans, so we're paying through the nose with private insurance).... I feel like I've done everything I'm supposed to and just gotten in a huge pile of debt and failure and disappointment and there's just no way to claw out. I read things on line about how people never thought their six-month unemployment would eve end until they finally got hired, and I seriously freak out.

I was seeing a counselor, for a few years. We both were seeing a couples counselor as well. Not currently seeing either as had to drop them due to ever-changing schedules or lacking health insurance. I did get a refill on my Sertraline last winter before my most recent insurance was cancelled, and I doubled my morning dosage today (without discussing with anyone.) I'm calmer than I was yesterday but I still feel something--not really a pain, just something--in the middle of my forehead and I just want to disappear and ignore everything I need to do in the world, because clearly I just can't.

Last night my oldest daughter was upset and screamed that she wasn't good at anything. That upset me, as I've felt the same way for decades. There's nothing I'm good at. I don't have friends. I submit resumes & letters to people who know me--who I've worked on projects in the past together, and who I thought got along with well--and don't get any response. I used to get thoughtful, considerate responses after rejected letters or interviews that went nowhere-I don't get those anymore. I just don't know what to do.

I can't remember what the time is 3 seconds after i checked it, i can't remember what i was going to type here, and i wasn't joking about that i literley just forgot.",03Aug2017,3

66,"Trying to be brief...

I'm around 30 and have had zero issues until this point in life.  My mid 20's were exceptionally pretty awesome, even if I was dirt poor.  I am currently in a position of fairly considerable power at work and have a lot of experience being in a position of authority and kind of guiding the ship (college baseball coach previously).

However....last year I went through an experience where I voluntarily kind of put myself in a position where other people knew absolutely nothing about me and had almost complete control over my day to day activities.  Lots of rules.  Can't go anywhere, can't do this, have to do that a specific way, have to live in this building...things like that.  I'm not sure how to explain it....but apparently at some point I went from taking it in stride and having a firm grip on the situation to feeling a bit overwhelmed?  I guess?  As in I felt like one would as a second grader who got in a lot of trouble and is trying to hide his crime, or is waiting for dad to get home and punish him....that sort of feeling.  Which is absurd because outside of this setting I had a professional resume and would have been equal to if not leading the people who were now somehow causing these feelings of inferiority/submission.

That stuff is over and done with, but I find myself on more than one occasion recalling events, as one does, and those same feelings of submission and quasi fear creep back in and kind of shift the gears in my mind again and it kind of shakes me up.  Gets in my head....derails me for a bit...if that makes sense.  

So just want to type out my thoughts as a sort of therapy measure and see if maybe anyone has some good feedback?  Does that make sense to anybody?  Is there anything I can do to move on from all this ridiculousness?",03Aug2017,2
