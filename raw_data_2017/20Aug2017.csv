0,"Been lurking here for a while, usually only really see posts and topics concerning the above mentioned, and without that being an issue (far from it), I always wondered where to go for mental issues less mood altering. 

For instance I have pretty bad psychosomatic/imagined breathing issues and hypochondria (like, I can't read about an illness without immediately starting to reason as to why I also have that illness and have to actively stop my mind from going on a crazy tangent),  and I was wondering if there were other people like me here?

3,"Ok so I know that I have depression, GAD, OCD and bulimia. So I'm not sure exactly what this symptom is part of. But I'm going through some rough times, just got in and promptly out of my second relationship where I coincidentally got USED lmao, and for a few weeks, I was really paranoid and sad. But the last other week has been my emotions fluctuating an EXTREME AMOUNT. Now though, a lot of the sad and angry are gone. I'm still having suicidal thoughts, but now I'm just laughing at everything. All of it's funny. I just got insulted by that guy I was talking about over snapchat. It is the most hilarious thing ever. I was just degrated and compared to ""garbage,"" but I thought it was hilarious and I could not stop laughing about it. That shit is funny. It's all a joke. My life. Sounds like I'm sad. But I'm not! Or I just am and have developed some sort of tic? But either way, it's hilarious and I LEGITIMATELY think it's funny. Take this entire paragraph in the most literal sense, because that IS what I mean. It makes no difference whether I am sober, drunk, or high, and I AM sober most of the time. I can't stop laughing at how bad everything is. Even thinking about suicide makes me laugh. This only started happening in the past few weeks, and I'm kind of worried.  Wtf is happening to me? Is this some sort of mental illness or symptom I don't know about?",20Aug2017,9

5,"For a little less than a year now, my overall mood has been sliding downward. I'm not sure whether or not to label it as depression or if I'm just dramaticizing the issue. I feel tired and low on energy constantly, rarely do I have any motivation for even things that I ""enjoy"" or at least used to. Sometimes I find myself in a haze or dreamlike fog if you will. Nothing seems real for short periods of time and nothing particularily matters too much to me. I've never seriously considered suicide, but it enters my thoughts almost daily. Nothing seems to truly make me happy anymore. It feels as though I've lost that light in my eyes. College seems pointless though I continue to attend. I just feel meaningless in the grand scale of humanity. My mood used to vary more on a daily basis but over the last month it has need very consistently melancholy/apathetic.

10,"Hello Reddit,

I'm going to keep this as 'brief' and abrupt as I can, before I write you all a book (I love writing). So long story short, had a twisted turn of events unfold during early adolescence, attempted suicide and ended up being diagnosed with depression, paranoia and anxiety after being sent to therapy - however dropped out due to severely not ready and couldn't bare the scenario - some weeks prior to this I had began hearing what seemed to be a demon follow me around. 

I had never taken any form of drug at the time, maybe a few sips of alcohol and that was all. The voice was very loud and intrusive, often commanding in a very negative way. Life had its ups and down, and with the up became the lack of appearance of this voice.

Just over 2 years on, I am still plagued with auditory hallucinations but in a different way. I now often hear intrusive thoughts - like sentences being placed directly within my thoughts, as if they are my own but much darker and twisted, often petrifying. 

There is also a constant race of thoughts when not intrusive, often muddled and hard to hear - much like a crowd of people all chatting among themselves. This can be very tiring and painful at times, often heightened at night.

I am being referred to certain doctors as we speak, however only recently have I come to grips with what has been going on. I have often just been left frightened, confused, scared and suffering - half thinking either this was just normal for everyone or that I was insane.

I have spent most part of the last 18mo smoking weed as a form of sedative, clouding my mind of a lot of these thoughts. There has been no worsening of the effects with this, however they are still not near quiet enough to make daily life enjoyable.

Not sure what I'm really getting to hear, bit of a vent, bit of a realisation, bit of a 'someone help me i'm fucking scared' post as well. Any response will be most likely be responded upon and appreciated gracefully.",21Aug2017,1

12,"I fit the whole ""gifted but troubled"" mold. When I was younger, it was more depression and social anxiety. I've also been eccentric and the ""weird one"" in any group. I've heard voices and had weird fantasies, like thinking about suicide and having intrusive thoughts about things like making out with someone nearby I thought was unattractive. Sometimes I'd get the energy to do some projects. Once while doing this I lost part of a finger. I found alcohol and fell in love. I finished high school, and moved on to college with a full scholarship. Here, there wasn't even a group to be weird in. Totally alone for 2 years until I started grad school, save for a few people I met once who never wanted to talk to me again. The stress of it turned me more towards the bottle and smoking, but I kept a 4.0. Still constant depressive thoughts. Sometimes got energy and kept making partially finished video games. I got opportunities for summer research and great letters of reccomendation. I finished and got my master's, and developed such a bad drinking problem I got withdrawals and all that.

I accepted an offer for an assistantship for a PhD program. I was able to quit alcohol and smoking and stabilized myself. I was enthusiastic at first, and weird feelings and stress crept up on me. Started drinking some again. Did reckless things like driving home from a party without telling anyone over terrible anxiety and paranoia. I eventually hit a break where I was feeling actively suicidal. I remembered an old bottle of oxy and took some. That started a whole path that even involved heroin that I still can't get off, just doing kratom now. I still crave oxy and h all the time. During that time, I missed a lot of class. I don't know how but I still got A's. Along with that, I started abusing basically everything that has a name. Speed, acid, pcp, coke, xans, etc. I've managed bouts of getting clean. I feel a bit more psychotic after it all though, with some odd thoughts. I'll sometimes have a rambling internal monologue. I managed to start dating a girl, still am. I go back and forth between thinking she is the best and hating her. Recently, I was happy. Too happy to study, there were bigger things. I got really in to economics and trade and read a lot and did work and invested money and things were looking good. Future gonna be bright. Suddenly, crash. Nothing matters, I want to die. No energy. Who cares if I fail? Patterns like that stopped me from studying for qualifiers that I am now bound to fail.

I kept trying to fix symptoms with drugs, and I am almost sure it is making it worse. Right now I'm tapering usage and trying to quit. Then I can better get to the core of the problem. Even before drugs I had lots of issues that were really clear to me. I think bipolar is the most major possible issue, especially since I have relatives with it. My girlfriend's mom, who used to be a special ed director, also mentioned aspergers to her which makes sense. Do therapy and medications help? I live in pain a lot but I have extreme doctor phobia. I am absolutely afraid to go to one, even when I told myself I would. I just want a semblance of normalcy back, my life has been emotional hell.",21Aug2017,1
13,"For the past week, I've been having sleep hallucinations every. Single. Night. Every time I try to go back to sleep, another one decides to come up. I have gotten less than 15 hours of sleep in 4 days. I've been living off energy drinks during my work shifts and naps. 

For a bit of an explanation, the hallucinations are most commonly spiders. Now, I used to be nervous around spiders before, but I was still able to dispose of them with a napkin. Now, the years of spider hallucinations have caused me to develop a very strong fear of them. I know it's pathetic, but I can't help it. 

Recently, there's been a spider problem in my house. I've been finding them around a lot. I don't know where they are coming from and I've been trying to take steps to prevent them. But they still come around and like to hang out in my room and around the hallway. I've been battling this one spider for the past 4 days now. My father killed it tonight, but before that, it's been causing me trouble along with the other hallucinations. 

I'm hearing voices and hearing noises now. Three nights ago I first heard these two unfamiliar male voices talking outside my door. They were speaking unintelligible things at the same time. Two nights ago, one voice said something that terrified me.  I heard the sound of something heavy falling in the bathroom next to me room and then this-

""Bang! The spider is back."" I don't remember exactly what it said since I was in full panic mode, but it definitely said either ""bang"" or ""boom"" and something about the spider being back and maybe something about it being on the ceiling. When I opened my eyes and turned on the lights, the same spider I had been trying to kill for days was above my head on the ceiling. I lost it once more and I had to have my boyfriend come get me. 

At this point I was exhausted, very tightly wound and horribly skittish. My chest was burning and my heart was pounding from exhaustion. I was on the verge of tears. I knew I was going crazy and I had just woken my boyfriend up at 3 in the morning in a terror filled state. I still feel guilty about it... 

Tonight he made it clear that I either needed to get help or he couldn't be with me anymore. We've been together for almost 5 years now and along with the hallucinations, I have other mental illnesses. I've tried to get help many times, but it isn't working out. I'm waiting for morning so I can call the doctor about the hallucinations... I know I need at least antidepressants and antipsychotics. 

Tonight, my boyfriend asked if I was high because of my obsession with this spider that had been terrorizing me. He made it clear that it was ridiculous and he got upset with me because he got a flat tire running over a nail in his driveway. He was coming to get rid of the spider once and for all even though I told him I was going to take care of it with a vacuum. He admitted to waiting to long to fill his tires with air and that contributing to his tire troubles, but he still came off as blaming me for it.
I offered to pay for his new set of tires, but he declined saying he would break up with me if I left him money. He said he was fed up and he would deal with it himself. 

Should I be feeling guilty for my mental health problems causing so much trouble? I definitely feel guilty, but I also feel confused with his outburst at me... he said that it was okay up until today.. I even apologized... I know this fear is irrational, but I've had hallucinations of spiders crawling all over me for a while now and I'm just so terrified of them now... ",21Aug2017,1

16,"I get these demonic hallucinations,  weird moments where everything is slowed and blurred. I'll see something like my cats running, but my boyfriend tells me they're not in the room. Movements in the dark make me feel like someone's watching me. Sometimes I go days thinking I'm dead from a suicide attempt or a freak accident, still not fully convinced I'm not. I only go out about 3 times a year, but when I do I am worrying about my getting there and being killed and sacrificed by my friends. If something pops in my mind it's not leaving until whatever it is is taken care of. If I go to sleep before my thoughts are completely cleared I'll have vivid nightmares about whatever I was worrying about. I am always very irritable and when I get so mad I get extremely suicidal. I talk clearly without even knowing I'm talking. I'm always waiting for something to jump out at me. I am constantly pulling my hair to where I have bald spots. In relationships I struggle with complete trust. Can never drop the feeling that I'm going to be left for someone less difficult. Sometimes I feel like I should go more in depth with a doctor about what goes on, already diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but that's not even the surface of my mind process. On the other hand I feel like this is normal and I'm just overreacting, or someone's going to say I'm just trying to be edgy. ",21Aug2017,2

I constantly have that feeling of doom in the pit of my stomach, and I can't concentrate on anything. The depression is better though, which makes me think lamictal and zoloft are working well together.



So obviously my issue is the anxiety. The klonopin is 1 mg as needed, but technically the anxiety is every day, and I'm only given 15 pills. Not to mention I don't feel different whatsoever on 1 - 2 mg of klonopin. I've always had a higher tolerance for medicine, but I'm afraid of going into my appt and saying that. 


I'm basically hoping that someone here has found a combination that helps them, and if anyone has an alternative for the klonopin that might be stronger, anything other than xanax, that I can discuss with my psychiatrist.

20,"My name is Elicia Boulton and I am a student at UWE undertaking my Professional Doctorate in Counselling Psychology. As part of this course I am undertaking research into the experience of sex in women who have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The aim of the current project is to listen to women’s voices and understand their experiences of sexuality and sexual practices when they have been diagnosed with and/or undergone therapy for OCD. This research is supervised by Victoria Clarke (Victoria.Clarke@uwe.ac.uk).

This research is open to women aged 18 or older who have a formal diagnosis of OCD and/or have received treatment for this condition (including women who have recovered and are willing to write about their past experiences). The research is open to all women so please feel free to share the details of the research widely. I hope to hear from women with a wide range of sexual experiences and identities (including women who identify their sexuality as heterosexual/straight, lesbian, bisexual, queer, and trans and cisgender women).

Participating in the study involves completing an online open-ended survey - you'll be asked to provide some basic information about yourself (nothing that will identify you). The personal information collected in this research project (i.e. the interviews and the demographic data) will be processed by the University in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 1998 Data Protection Act. We will hold your data securely and not make it available to any third party unless permitted or required to do so by law. The survey involves answering a series of open questions about your experiences of sexuality and OCD; you respond in your own words (this is not a click box style survey). The survey will take around 20-30 minutes to complete depending on how detailed your answers are.

Please use the following link to access the survey if it is something you are interested in or would like to share, and many thanks in advance for taking the time to read this: -https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7Ptf1L1YvxWhivj

21,"tl;dr: My boyfriend broke up with me because I've hurt him repeatedly due to my BPD, depression and anxiety

Let me start by saying I am a 21F with a now ex boyfriend who is 20. We both study and work full time. I apologise if some of this will be rambling but I have to get it out, I don't even care if he reads this. We were together for almost a year with our anniversary in one weeks time but two days ago he broke up with me. I have depression, anxiety, OCD and borderline, all of which are very severe and I see a psychologist and psychiatrist twice a week for therapy and medications. Over the year we have been together I have gradually gotten more unstable which has led to me threatening suicide or hurting myself or saying I would sleep with other guys to annoy him or upset him. I am a disgusting human being for doing this. I have issues controlling my anger and temper and cry over the most little things. He also has his fair share of issues including depression, anxiety and ADHD. He also takes medication but is a lot more stable than I am I believe. I have said things like 'we're over' in the heat of the moment and immediately regretted it after. Every time he has taken me back until now. I am so ashamed of my feelings and lack of ability to gain insight into the consequences of my actions and things I say. I hate myself for being the way I am. What caused him to finally break it off for good was that I chose to bring up the topic of me feeling neglected sexually just as he was leaving to see a friend. I had extremely poor judgement and blurted it out and couldn't believe I'd been so stupid immediately. Idk why I do these things to the person I love. For some reason I hope he comes across and reads this. Right now I sit here in tears hating myself and not wanting to go on. I know life could be so amazing for me but my depression is so severe I often dissociate from the real world and feel like I'm in a terrible dream. He has been my rock for almost a year and all I've done is hurt him for fear he will cheat on me or leave me like my past boyfriends have and I've lost the only person I've ever truely wanted in 21 years and the only person who has loved me unconditionally.
I understand he can't deal with me, but he still tells me he is in love with me and loves me like he always has. I just want him back and I want another chance to prove to him I can get better. He said we will never get back together as I've hurt him to much. He got so angry he punched a hole in his bedroom wall and screamed at me to stop crying. I was so distraught and ashamed and disgusted with myself I wanted to kill myself. I called three mental health/suicide hotlines last night when he was at uni just to speak to someone who could possibly understand. They were all of little help so I lay on our bed and listened to one of our favourite songs reading a card he had written me while crying and he got home at that time and said I'd probably set it up to make him feel bad which is absolutely not true. He then packed my bags for me and threatened to drag me out of his house while I was naked cause he said he didn't want to look at me anymore. He doesn't believe a word of what I say anymore and doesn't trust me. He thinks everything I do is to get at him or manipulate him. This is fair enough. I just want him back, I feel so abandoned and as if he believes I'm a lost cause. I was doing so well for a week until I decided to let my thoughts get the better of me and blurted out how I felt neglected which was so so so stupid. I feel I have lost this person who I had this amazing physical and emotional connection with. We saw eye to eye with everything, we helped each other through some truely terrible personal times, we had amazing sex every day and the same goals in life. He was perfect and I fucked it up.


Reddit, oh my god have I fucked it all up. I don't know what to do, my friends have no idea how I feel right now. They're supportive but no one truely gets my lack of control and my guilt I feel after I make a stupid decision. I just want the person who loves me and who I love to come back. He said there's nothing I can do, the damage is already done. That is fair enough but I'm so desperate to not let go of him. Reddit, I am a terrible person. And baby, you will always be my first true love, I am so sorry I've done what I have. I will never forgive myself for ruining us. I just need to get this off my chest. I am so shitty and I took you for granted. I am so so sorry. What can I do Reddit?

I've struggled with hallucinations, both visual and hearing ones since I was a child, but no diagnosis for it, as it seems I'm not taken seriously. Probably because it's not all the time, but in periods. This winter they put me on Zyprexa, which was wonderful for the issues I have, but it made me so hungry. I had hunger pains 24/7, and my metabolism completely shut down. Already being overweight that wasn't a good combo at all. I talked my way out of using that antipsychotic medicine, but was forced to promise to start up again if my hallucinations came back. 
Well, now things are going downhill and I find myself too scared to say anything about it, as I've currently got my already existing eating-problem somewhat under control, and I've lost some weight. 
I live in a care facility, so there's staff around me at all times. The main problem is that it's a small town, so qualified people are far and few between. The only one I somewhat trust is my primary contact, but I found out yesterday she's quitting the job so she can get another one without late night shifts. 
This place is depressing. Nobody understands my issues, let alone how to deal with them. I don't even know what's wrong with me, because the therapists can't seem to figure it out either, or they're not even bothered. The one I have now isn't even a licensed therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist. I feel like no one cares and I'm all alone. I want to move far away from this place. Different country, even (I live in Europe). I'm sorry I'm dumping so much here, but I genuinely have no idea what to do.

28,"My mum has had a bit of a hard time in life. Her first husband (my birth father) was pretty deplorable. Lots of horrible physical and mental abuse. She looked into psychopathy at the time of divorce and came to her own conclusions about how he was a psychopath. This gave her a lot of comfort and relief. It does fit, he does have a lot of the signs, but I don't know for sure whether he is or isn't a psychopath. That's not really the problem, the problem is that my mum survived her abuse by learning tonnes about psychopaths in an attempt to protect herself and in the process, she became too obsessed with psychopaths in my opinion. So now as a result, everyone who mistreats her is a psychopath apparently and she just constantly accuses people of being a psychopath. Even me, at one point which was just frustrating because I know I'm not a psychopath and nobody else has ever though that I might be one.  She's just hurting and suffering and trying to protect herself by being paranoid. 


I'm really bored of talking about psychopaths. When we talk, she spends literally hours lecturing me about psychopaths and how to deal with them and how to be prepared for them if I ever come across one. I've tried asking her to tone it down, but she's incredibly defensive so if you ever appear to be 'criticising her' (or just even suggesting something), she flies off the handle and it makes everything worse, so I've just started sitting there going ""mmm"" ""yeah"" ""interesting"" for like 2 hours while she goes on and on, and she doesn't even notice the fact that I'm not listening because she's so immersed in her speech. 


I don't really judge her for this and it doesn't make me angry because I know how much she's been through. I'm just getting tired of it and I feel sorry for her, because in being so obsessed with psychopaths she's cutting a lot of people out and her paranoia is not serving her very well right now. I can see from an outside perspective that it's hurting her.

So a bit of background: I've been selfharming intermittently since early highschool. No one would normally pick it.. I have lots of friends and a bf and have such a lucky blessed life with beautiful family and people. During highschool it was always very controlled cutting. I was fine and (basically) cut free from aged 17 until 20. It has generally always been anxiety related until the last year and a bit where it has become a form of punishment/ due to self loathing. 

I am trying so hard - I have a safety plan in place and am seeing a psychologist. I'm on meds to help my anxiety. I want to be the best person I can be for my bf and for me (and my dog lol).. but as soon as I have a bad week then try and catch up with girlfriends, or if bf goes out to the pub and I want to join, I'll get intoxicated and then if he's not there when I get home, I will cut myself. Quite aggressively and uncontrollably because my inhibitions are loosened. 

I love and adore my boyfriend so much and I know he loves me too (sorry for soppiness), but this is really hurting him and he has told me he finds the cuts disgusting and he doesn't know how much longer he can do this. I know what I need to change (less/no drinking among other things) but I just feel like I've gone too far this time and that he mightn't be able to see a future with me any more.

I just feel so alone when normally I know he can be there to support me... 

What do I do? How do I show him that I am sorry for what I've done? Please give me any words of support or advice.. I've tried talking to him but I can just tell it upsets him and now I just feel alone. And that's not a good thing for me to feel. 

Hope this all makes sense.. please help!

Tldr: I cut again. My boyfriend is hurt and disgusted. I feel so alone. How do I talk to him about it? Any words of support or advice are welcome.

36,"I'm from Canada 

I want to specify that this problem that I've been having is likely drug induced. I am stopping all drug use aside from weed/kratom for a long while due to it, but the thoughts I have penetrating my mind seem to persist for a week+ after psychedelic or mdma use. I am currently experiencing these thoughts 2 days after what should have been an incredible forest party full of love and psychedelia. 

I am also aware that the problems I am about to describe sound extremely selfish, self centered, and unappreciative of what I have. That contributes to how I feel about the situation as a whole, because I feel like I am truly fucking over everyone in my life by thinking so poorly of them. 

So the problem: I have slowly developed a friend group which is extremely close. Most if not all of us wouldn't bat an eyelash when stating that our love for each other runs deeper even than any blood ties to real family. But over the past couple of months, any time I do the heavier drugs with them (other than ketamine for some reason), I eventually dive into a hole where I believe that they are all conspiring against me. I cannot deduce the reason that I believe this, but the most effective trigger for it is when I am told directly, one on one, about how ""amazing and lovable"" I am. (Again, fucked up, selfish, unappreciative. Seriously my biggest problem is that people tell me they love me? What nerve do I even have to be asking this question here among those with real problems. I digress). I end up basically catatonic, analyzing every single word that is spoken, not even to me, just around me. I bury my head in my hands and think about how it all must be connected. How they all must be bull shitting me because there is simply no way I'm worth constantly being praised. They must be trying to build my ego so they can eventually rip themselves away from me and leave me completely alone. I've even gotten to the point where I believe my coworkers and my own mother are in on this conspiracy to ruin me. All because I'm praised. I don't understand why I can't escape these thoughts and I don't know what else to do so I came here looking for advice on where to look next to get over this bull shit. 

If all you can say is to get my head out of ass, please do, because maybe that's my only hope. But I really just want to know if I should consider professional help for something like this. ",21Aug2017,1
37,"Something odd happens to me several times a day. Periodically I will start thinking about devisive issues (politics or whatever the current social argument is.) and will start to ""debate."" I was on the debate team in HS and learned to try to anticipate the other side's arguments. Also I have a politically diverse group of FB friends so I regularly get to see many sides of the arguments. The problem is that whenever the ""debate"" gets heated, ie I start thinking about the worst of the worst arguments I beat or clap my hands together. Once I get started it will go for about 30 seconds if I'm in public up to an hour if I'm at home (no pretending I'm in public doesn't seem to help.)

Obviously, I need to get checked out by a professional but financially that's not an option right now. I'm just trying to get an idea of what the fuck this is. ",21Aug2017,1

40,"Please don't judge me or post nasty comments. This is a community where we seek help. 

I can openly admit that I get jealous and insecure because my boyfriend does things and doesn't invite me. He's in a sports league and travels a lot, and never invites me to go out of state with him, but all of the other guys invite their girlfriends. It's causing me to obsess and lurk on his facebook and Instagram friends and ask him who is with and what he's doing constantly. It's healthy to do things separately...but sometimes I feel like he likes to be away from me a lot. 

He's honestly a great guy, and if I would just calm down and stop worrying and freaking out on him, things would be so great between us. 

I know in my mind I don't need to worry, but sometimes he makes me feel very unwanted and unloved. I've expressed these emotions to him and he says he will work on making things better. I don't know how to calm myself down. I feel like my depression and anxiety is going to push us apart. I'm very conflicted. I don't want to nag him constantly and be annoying, but I also don't want to sit and suffer in silence. I need to find a healthy medium. He comes home in a few hours (I haven't seen him in over a week) and I feel very strange about seeing him. I'm not even really excited. I'm more mad that I wasn't invited... I'm mad that he even plays that stupid sport. 

2 years ago he posted a picture of him and his GF at the time and gave her a shout out for being so supportive. He won't let me be supportive. So I'm also getting anxious at the fact that if he's going to post something about it, if I'm not tagged, it's going to cause a HUGE fight. 

I told him next season that I'm going to every single practice, tournament &amp; championship. Invited or not. I told him next year it's a WE thing, so he might as well buy me a jersey too. ",21Aug2017,3

43,"I don't know if this is an actual mental health issue, I haven't managed to find anything online about people experiencing similar things.  I'm not sure where to start, but basically for about 10 years now, I seem to be having cycles of experiencing extreme religious feelings for a few weeks or months at a time, which then go away, only to return months or years later.  Some of the religious episodes have been centred around New Age stuff, but for most of that time, they've involved Christianity.

So what happens is that for a few weeks or months at a time, I feel intensely strongly that Christianity is true.  I feel really fundamentalist about it, throw away all of my blasphemous heavy metal CDs, go to church and confession, even confess to things that could get me in trouble, because I feel so strongly that Christianity is the truth and I'll go to hell otherwise.  I decide to totally devote my life to Jesus, the full works.  I feel partially terrified that I'll go to hell if I don't get it right, and partially peaceful because now none of my earthly problems matter in the great scheme of things.  But then I go back to normal, for months or years (months usually, it seems to be a few weeks or months on, then a few weeks or months off.)  Then I think ""What the fuck was I thinking?"" and feel angry about all the stupid things I did while feeling religious, throwing away hundreds of pounds worth of CDs and DVDs, giving money to charity that I can't afford, confessing to past sins and crimes that could get me in trouble, etc.  

It's like I can't trust my own mind.  I've just come out of one of these phases in the past few days, in which I stupidly confessed to something that I wish I hadn't now.  Right now, I think ""that was stupid, how could I do that,"" but I know that the hyper-religiosity will come over me again and I'll probably do more stupid stuff.  Is this a medical condition?  Has anyone here ever heard of something like this?  I do normally have severe, chronic, clinical depression, if that's relevant.",21Aug2017,2

47,"I have a question about Seasonal Affective Disorder. I had read a bit about it but I am in no way a social science person and I don't understand a lot of what I am reading. I went with a friend to an open lecture about Psychology and in part of it the lecturer mentioned that they had a patient who developed Season Affective Disorder after they broke their leg and spent months indoors, unable to go outside. They raised the question of whether this was determined by their genetics and a biological predisposition to seasonal depression, or a 'behavioural' learned response to associating being stuck indoors and associating this with their pain and isolation, so essentially they got depressed at the same time as a 'neutral' stimuli and ended up associating them. (Not sure I am getting this all correct.)


I thought that things like depression were *always* brought on by your brain physically not making enough dopamine or serotonin. And then if something happens to trigger it, your body gets pushed off balance. So if someone with a brain predisposed to depression would get it if they were widowed for example and someone with a 'healthy' brain wouldn't. But it seemed like she was saying you can '*aquire*' a seasonal depression due to tricking your mind into it and then it never goes away?


Can someone clarify it for me or maybe point me to a subreddit that can?


One reason I am interested is that I think my fianceé has it and I think she got it from being sick often as a child and having to spend summers indoors and her bedroom didn't have any windows and that might be one reason she insists on a home being full of windows and light while we are house shopping.",21Aug2017,3

Since coming out a few years ago, I have been extremely depressed. My family has cut ties with me. I have lost a lot of friends. In addition to being a sad motherfucker all the time, I have lost the ability to retain information. I don't have the mental capacity to do tasks that require a lot of remembering and concentration. It's affecting my professional life, and my friendships. My friends think I'm boring and quite dull, since I do things which aren't adventurous and require very little effort. I am losing my mind. I tried therapy but it's useless and quite expensive. I tried to find help groups but sadly those don't exist in India.

I've noticed during my time in the clinic and browsing various forums including Reddit that anhedonia seems to not only be one of the more debilitating symptoms of mental illness, but also the least responsive to any treatment. It is rampant - and anecdotally seems to have many sub-types that I am not sure why it's not recognized as its own illness as most consider it just a symptom. But if you go try to find information on the topic in scientific journals and databases the information is scarce and there seems to be little hope for the people that suffer from anhedonia.

I've been on Effexor XR 37.5mg for over 6 months.  At first it was working well, but now I'm starting to feel like garbage again.  I take it responsibly except for one time a few month ago when I ran out and the pharmacy was slow for like 3-4 days.  So 3-4 days without it left me a mess because of withdrawal.  Anxious, crying spells for no reason, uncontrollably feeling of loneliness.  Once I started taking it regularly again, I felt normal and not depressed.

Now even when taking it regularly, I feel depressed and anxious.  It's like before I went on antidepressants. I'm wondering if I should go the next dose up or my doctor was thinking Wellbutrin.
 
I was an Paxil 10mg up to 30 before and that helped me.  This went on for roughly a year and a half. Then an outside psyche put me on Prozac 20 mg and Trazodone 50mg which FUCKED ME UP!  I was hearing and imagining crazy shit.  And screaming at voices stop. So I had psyche meds fucking me up, and at the same time my dad decided to switch into uncaring dick mode and treating me like shit despite how near my breaking point I was.  It was a fucking mad house...

Anyway...  I kind of want to try my Paxil again since stuff has calmed down immensely and I didn't gain weight.  I'm so sorry that this is a jumbled mess.  If you need any explaining or more info, just ask please.  But what would you people recommend?",21Aug2017,1

61,"[17M] Lately, I've wanted to test to see if I have an attention-linked disorder of some sort. However, it would seem really foolish to spend $300+ for a test that I think will most likely result as negative. I'm still very curious though as I've had trouble paying attention my whole life. I'm so sorry if this seems like a self-diagnosis, but I don't want to go to my doctor without a valid reason to be tested (as judged by the commenters, preferably commenters that have a attention disorder). I've made a list of characteristics that may or may not be the reason I might have an attention linked disorder. 

Characteristics that imply an attention-linked disorder:
- I got bad grades in elementary school, and my teachers suggested remedial classes as I seemed to not catch on to my studies. 
- At the age of 4, my mother put me in martial arts classes because she thought I was too hyperactive (I would run around too much, try to imitate action movies I saw at the time)
- When I was put into private piano lessons from my grandparents at the age of 6, I was already playing college-level pieces at the age of 9, but at the time didn't even know how to read sheet music or could recall basic music theory as I never payed attention to what my piano teacher said to me.
- I am very sensitive. I cried on the second day of kindergarten because I didn't know how to write my name. I cried during martial arts whenever I was scolded for misbehaving. I cried during piano lessons after my teacher scolded me for not practicing or knowing basic music literature. I cried last month because my French teacher was leaving the school, and I was the only boy who cried. 
- I never pay attention in class. I cannot recall a single lesson where I paid attention throughout middle school or high school. I just daydream about other stuff I'm interested in. 
- I spend all of my personal free time in my bedroom or bathroom. I pace around in circles listening to music or creating imaginary conversations with myself. This can go on for hours until I'm tired. 
- I used to have horrible insomnia. At it's worst point in 7th grade (around the time of my growth spurt), I would stay up for at least 2-3 days straight without even feeling tired. I just felt so energetic, that I would pretend to be an action movie star in my kitchen and jump around. Little fun fact, I wanted to be a stuntman when I was in second grade. Embarrassingly enough, I still do that even though I'm a high school junior...
- I never do my work on time. I'm always turning in something late because I just can't focus on any of my work. 
- I am very disorganized. I have plenty of folders and binders to use at home, but I decide to throw my work in my backpack all disheveled throughout the whole school year. I have been doing this since the 7th grade. 
- I am distracted very easily. For example, if I am doing a task, a song in my head can ruin the flow of my work ethic, and will drift off completely from what I was planning to do originally. 
- I feel like a million thoughts race through my head at once when I'm thinking (although that is a very generic assumption).
- I am very impulsive. For example, I punched my best friend in the back as hard as I could during 8th grade recess, because I was curious to see what would happen. Angrily, he asked why I did it, and I genuinely don't know why I did it, but I felt horrible after doing it. I still do stupid stuff like this, but it's too embarrassing to talk about.
- I am often called out for not paying attention to what my family members or friends are saying to me.
- I also get called out for staring at people without even noticing. Another embarrassing story incoming, I got called a  creep by one of my classmates in my first week of school for accidentally staring at her while daydreaming , and while I laughed when she called me that I wanted to cry. 
- Even the smallest negative comments can ruin my day (like someone saying my joke isn't funny, or that I'm jokingly autistic according to my friends). 
- Whenever I read, I blank out and read without knowing what the text actually means. I also skim through long excerpts as I'm very impatient. This impatience is also reoccurring when I watch movies or do homework. 
- I usually throw violent tantrums in private. Recently my friend didn't respond to my texts when we both planned to go see a movie on that day, and I ended up banging my head furiously onto my pillow, or facepalming repetitively in an aggressive manner until I got tired. This still happens, but the tantrums come from reminiscing repressed memories. 
- I heard that liking dangerous activities is a sign of ADHD, but I'm not sure. I love breakdancing, extreme martial arts, skateboarding, and fantasize about getting into Indiana Jones/Jackie Chan style fights and adventures. I love when my adrenaline is pumping, but it can lead me into doing reckless things. 
- Along with breakdancing, I fidget with my hands a lot in finger tutting (making patterns and shapes with your fingers). But I get called out by my mom in public for doing it too much, thinking I'm throwing up gang signs. 
- I have heavy mood swings (this is another generic remark, but it's a common complaint coming from my family members).
- I am very forgetful. In fact, I legitimately forgot what I was going to write next so I replaced it with this bullet point.

There are a million more things I can think of, but this portion is going off topic. So, I'm going to write a list of the things that imply I don't have an attention-linked disorder:

- I have a high GPA, and take all IB and AP classes despite struggling with focusing on my studies. However, I do all of my work last minute the morning  it's due. I figure that many ADD/ADHD students would have low grades without the use of medication ( although that may be a poor assumption from my POV).
- I am not talkative. I barely talk actually, as I used to be criticized for being annoying or blurt out anything I was thinking of until the 6th grade. Because of the embarrassment from those remarks made to me, I decided to control what I'd say. 
- No one in my family has any attention linked disorders. My dad has Asperger's, and my mom has severe OCD. My sister tested for ADHD, because she thought it was the reason for her bad grades and lack of focus, but she was diagnosed with depression instead. She says I don't have it, which is most likely true. Yet, I have a completely different personality and mindset from hers. 
- Because of my classes, I am usually exhausted by the end of the day and do not have insomnia anymore. 
- I can sit still, but to be honest it does feel very liberating and relieving to burst out of my seat and just move freely around. 

That is all I can think of for now. Sorry about the long post. Tell me what you think I should do. Should I see a doctor? Again, I'm so sorry if it seems as if I'm self-diagnosing. I just need some consoling before seeing a mental health professional. Thanks for putting up with 10 page essay if you got to this point.",21Aug2017,3

 He has had two 5150's called on him and his current treatment plan seems to be mandated by a judge and seems to more try and  sedate him then actually treat his condition (he only sees an actual doctor for 15 minutes and majority of his medications are sedatives).

He really can't think straight for too long to be able to seek help himself (in fact he doesn't believe he needs mental illness help).

I found amitryptiline back in 2014 by accident, they told me it was a pain reliever, but I found it made me have the most vivid dreams, made me sleep so soundly I'd feel like I'd had a bunch of energy drinks by noon, and killed the ferocious mood swings. I also look different, I don't look 'ill' and my hair grew thick and dark because depression/stress was making it thin and fall out. 

I take it intermittently, and it's 20 mg. I'm very sensitive to drugs and very tiny, so 20 mg will send me to sleep within an hour. 

I have a heart deformity where there's too many electrical pathways - basically heart epilepsy, and during that my blood pressure can fall dangerously low to high. Up to 250 BPM at times, causing lack of oxygen/unconsciousness, and there's a risk of VF even at resting. 

I read online that someone was taking Ami for a year and began having heart problems which has me scared. But at the same time, I don't want to go back to 'old' me. 'Old' me was constantly entertaining my PTSD 24/7, got enraged by tiny things, and saw negatives in everything. My GP said all the stress would damage my heart further.

'New' me is a little duller (which is a side effect of Ami) but even when people give me passive aggression I just get that dumb oblivious feeling and keep going on like I'm on top of the world. Heck people even say I'm smiling and I'm not even trying. 

Yet heart problems are a massive fear of mine, I take verapamil to calm my heart but the doctor told me the Amitryptiline may interact with it.
