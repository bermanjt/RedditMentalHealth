0,"So this is really messing around with my head and has started since I left School last month. Basically I would have memories of doing something such as going to my local town centre or talking to someone and I would say that was about a month ago however it would turn out  to be a week or two ago when this particular event occurred.

Something like this

1. When I think it happened 2. When it actually happened

1. 3 days ago 2. A day ago

1. A week ago 2. 3 days ago

1. A month ago 2. 1-2 weeks ago

Another example is that I have memories of leaving school around late June ( almost 2 months now) but I think it's been longer than that. I recently went to Thorpe Park, this happened I don't know maybe Friday and it feels like it has been weeks. It seems I'm losing sense of time. 

Another case is last Friday I went out for the day with my friends, this feels like it was a week or two ago.
It's just weird. Anyone ever experienced this?",01Aug2017,1,

4,"Hi, I go to a university where there are a lot of clubs that advocate for mental health and such. I've been to a few of these meetings, but I can't help but feel a sense of ""otherness"" when I'm at them. They talk about people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness as if they're not in the crowd, or part of the student body that attends meetings. I would like to start a club where people who have been diagnosed with mental illnesses can join, as a space for student-discussions and support. 


I guess I'm having trouble figuring out if this would be an appropriate club to start? A lot of people don't talk about what they have been diagnosed with and keep it private, unlike me (which is a strange side effect of Venlafaxine, its made me really, really talkative). I do know that a lot of people at my school take SSRIs - something the nurse shared with me while I was picking up my prescription, not sure if she's allowed to share that kind of information.


I asked my boyfriend about it - he said, ""there's a club for most ethnic groups at school, there are clubs for only women dedicated to their causes, so there's nothing wrong with wanting a club with just mentally ill people"". 

Something about it just feels off, like I'd be doing something wrong. Please let me know if you have any tips or advice.",01Aug2017,1,
5,"I've allowed my mental health to get out of hand very badly. I'm not one to be very open. Is there any near Michigan who might run free clinic opportunities? I have no health insurance and can't afford to see one. 

I'll pay down the road if I have to. I'm not looking for drugs but my brother who is a medical professional often recommends that I should be on them and when I was younger I had therapy and meds. 

I'm highly against them, I'm a very quiet man. You wouldn't be able to tell something was wrong with me in person. ",01Aug2017,1,

I hope she is at peace. I hope she never feels pain again. You could see the deep sadness in her eyes. An overwhelming darkness that consumed her soul. It's so terribly sad. You never expect it to happen and then it does...just like that. She is gone. Gone gone...never coming back gone. I wonder what she was thinking...how long did she feel this way? Did she tell someone? Did she call or text or anything? Fuck. ",01Aug2017,12,
7,"If anyone knows a better subreddit for this be sure to let me know and I'll remove this post.

But anyways, I think I might have a mental illness. Please, hear me out. I just have this intense desire to have the greatest reputation or for people to pity me in anyway. I'll lie, cheat and steal to make any of that happen. I don't nessesarily want attention, I just want people to look at me and think that I'm a god or something or I just want people to worry about me.

Like, I've been thinking about lying about certain things that I can control. Maybe faking living in a wheelchair or pretending to have a broken arm or being deaf or something along those lines. I also have these fantasies of taking in homeless people and making them amazed at all the things I've given them. While watching native tribal people I wished that I could come and show them stuff to make them think I was a higher being. 

I don't lie all the time, I only lie when I know I can get away with it. I've been thinking about moving to a whole other state or even country to fake things about me.

Another thing I forgot to point out is that I like it when other people get hurt and I see everyone commenting on how they feel bad for them, wishing them a good life, sending out their prayers, etc,. 

Do you think this is a mental illness or I'm just weird? ",01Aug2017,6,

9,"So I actually have a LOT of friends and a great social life. This summer I traveled all around the world and did things and met people I never thought I would. Now I have a decent paying job and I'm accepted into a top 10 masters program for my major (comp sci). So my life isn't bad.

The problem is I'm always trying so hard to keep myself occupied. Last semester, I did school, worked two jobs (interned 20 hours per week and head TA-ed a class), worked in clubs (student radio, student newspaper), went to over 10 concerts, and did a bunch of various cool things ranging from a road trip to a cabin retreat to a renaissance fair and so on, while looking for a job.

I don't know how I manage it but I do. I like being so busy. If I'm not busy all the time, I get really sad and depressed right away when I have nothing to do. No one to be with. It's especially hard in summer with most of my friends out of town until school starts again. And I miss a girl a lot who always makes me happy but that's a different story I guess.

But this always happens. I had work today 9-5 and I was fine, I enjoyed being with my colleagues. Today I didn't have plans after work like I sometimes do, and immediately I'm so sad and lonely and it doesn't go away.

What's wrong with me? If I'm not busy or with people, I immediately get sad. Even though I have lots of things to look forward to soon, like music festivals and comiccon I'm just impatient. But I can't help it.

20,"Hello all!

You've probably clicked on this link and are thinking ""oh great, another mindless plea for our hard earned dollars"". Well, you're half right. This is a plea, but not a mindless one I can assure you.

My name is Alice, and I live in Perth (Western Australia) with my Psychiatric Assistance Dog Astro. **Together, we are trying to raise as many funds as we can for Lifeline Australia - a suicide prevention and mental health crisis telephone hotline.** You can learn more about what they do here: https://www.lifeline.org.au/about-lifeline/about-lifeline-overview

Somewhere in Australia there is a new call to Lifeline every 32 seconds. **Many of those calls over the years have been from myself, and without a doubt had the Lifeline service not existed I would not be here today.**

I have battled severe mental illness since childhood and in fact, I am typing this post from a psychiatric hospital bed. The road to recovery is not easy nor is it quick, but I can credit Lifeline with the fact I even have a second chance at life.

I want other Australians to have that same chance. I want those who are struggling and feel they have nowhere else to turn, to be able to pick up a phone, call Lifeline, and find even the smallest spark of hope to carry them through to the next day.

**Please check out my fundraising page (link at the bottom of the post).** If you have any spare change to donate, please consider doing so. **Every little bit helps.** You can even help by sharing the link to my fundraising page with your mates, work colleagues etc - increased visibility not only increases the chances of more fundraising, but it raises vital awareness of Lifeline and the services they provide.

If you have any questions or would like to know any more about all of this, please feel free to ask!

Many thanks,
Alice and Astro

21,"Not sure where to post this, but here seems good enough as any...

Anyway, for as long as I can remember I've had violent thoughts. ""Punch him"" ""Break that"" ""Burn this"". I've never acted on such thoughts, but they've been so loud in my head at times to where I have to isolate myself before I lose control.

Now recently, they've gotten much worse. And the reason I'm here today is because I had these thoughts about my girlfriend and my 2 year old son. I hate myself for these thoughts and I wish I could un-think them. I never want to ever think of my son that way again. 

Just as well, as I was walking up the stairs to my apartment the other day, I was thinking about killing. Not necessarily a human, but killing in general. And it scared me once I realized what was going on. I don't want to kill. Not even an animal.

25,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering if you could help me with feedback on my mental health app.  

Moodimo is a mood tracker to overcome anxiety and depression. It helps you to take stock of your emotions and to feel happier. It finds your triggers and recognises individual factors affecting your moods. There’s also an option to connect with a psychologist or chat with the community to ask for advice.

Website:  http://moodimo.com

1) What do you think of the flow of the app?  Is that that something that could get you excited to record your feelings?

2) Would this journaling help you to analyse the state of your mind. Why do you feel sad or happy these days, has anything triggered it? (see analytics about the most used names and locations that are recently on your mind)

3) Would you like to shout out some of your moments to the community to vent off?  Would you be interested to read what they feel about a particular hashtag?

4) Would you find it useful to have an opportunity to connect with a local psychologist via in-app messages, who can read your diary and the progress you're making?


Many Thanks for your feedback,

I'm a film student based in London and I'm making a documentary on male mental health.

I'm looking to find men who have suffered or are suffering from mental health issues, be it depression, eating disorders, extreme stress or anything in between. I'd love to talk to you about what you're going through, any help you've sought and received (if any) and gauge your opinions on the efforts of the NHS and other public bodies in tackling this monumental problem. 

I'm based in London and will happily travel to you, or I'll gladly pay for your travel/food/misc expenses if you'd like to come down instead. 

Please PM me if you'd like to contribute. As of 2012 men are committing suicide at 3x the rate women are, and I honestly believe we won't make any real headway if we continue to suffer in silence. ",01Aug2017,0,

33,"Hi everyone

For the last 10 years, I have struggled to tell myself that I'm gay.   I've tried lots of things. I have gay friends, I've dated guys (after dating girls and realising they weren't for me). I talk about it in therapy (I've been in therapy for 2 years).  I went through a phase a few years ago of being trans (or thinking I was) but I don't think that was who I really was, I was just trying to deny being gay. 

Anyway, what's strange is that I have all the acceptance of my family, friends, therapists, doctors and colleagues, but I still can't come out to myself.  It's like everyone else is OK with it, except me. This isn't like a situation where I have anything to be afraid of by coming out. 

I've dated men but even while doing that I was scared for anyone outside my family or friends that is, and even when I spoke to my family and friends, I felt awful admitting that I was gay. So this isn't a ""closet"" issue or a ""bravery"" issue.  I wish it were because they seem easier to solve.

When I'm at the LGBT choir, I feel like an outsider because i'm unable to admit to myself that I'm 'one of them'.  I pretend to be one of them and for all intents and purposes I am, but I lie to myself.  And when I'm around my gay friends, I find myself thinking ""ugh these guys are disgusting"" in the back of my mind, the ugly base part of my mind. I never say anything, because I know it's not what I really feel, but it's just so strong. 

I've also stopped having relationships with guys because men scare me a lot, that's a related but separate issue which I'm working on in therapy. 

From the very beginning when I was 18, I told myself ""I must not be gay"". It's been almost ten years now and I'm dying here mentally. I'm so trapped inside myself.  It's like this bullshit aggressive mega-bully thought process that basically says, you must not want what you want.   It's like I was fighting myself for no reason other than to make myself miserable. The thought goes like ""being gay makes me happy, therefore I must not do it"". It's like there a sub belief that, If I am gay, i will be unhappy and the world will end. I know logically this is not true, but the moment I try and say ""I'm gay out loud"" I get this huge tightness in my lungs and chest and i have a miniature panic attack and my brain goes numb and I can't cope. It's awful to live like this and therapy isn't really helping on this issue.  I think about this every minute of every day, and it holds me back from being happy. 

Does anyone have any thoughts? I would be SO grateful for anyone's advice.   I find regular people are far more helpful than therapist sometimes.

I want to write about experiences other than mine, so if you’re Disabled and comfortable talking about it, please reply with your experiences regarding ableism (especially saneism, seeing as I'm posting in a mental health Reddit) in academia, as well as the name you’d want used for you in the blog entry or if you’d prefer to be anonymous. I'm especially interested in students (and teachers, and other professionals) of the sciences, since I write a science blog, but Disabled people from other fields are welcome to reply.

Examples of ableism in academia, if it's at all helpful:

1) Disabled students being denied accommodations
2) Disability services being willing to help physically Disabled but not psychiatrically/developmentally Disabled students (happened to me) (or the reverse)
3) Campus buildings not being accessible
4) Disabled students being forced into medical leaves and not allowed to come back
5) Disabled students being encouraged to transfer to a community college and not allowed to transfer back
6) Psychiatrically Disabled students being forcibly admitted to psychiatric units of the hospital (happened to me)
7) Disabled students being forced to leave academic programs through unfair contracts after disclosing that they were disabled (happened to me)
8) Accommodations not being sufficient
9) Accommodations being nominally given but professors not complying
10) Professors or institutions being against trigger warnings and safe spaces
11) Attendance being part of a grade
