0,"I have a troubling issue in my life that I've been struggling with for years. The more i hope it goes away, the worse it gets.

I have an unquenchable desire to rape. I haven't, but it's all i think about.

I hate the feeling... I used to drink to drown the ideas out. I ended up an alcoholic and kicked out of the army... Still didn't slow down. I kept drinking, then i found it really hard to resist my urges. So i had to quit all together, though the thoughts persist.

I am a pretty self-aware individual; so i have been trying to figure out what is causing this. The best i can come up with is as follows:

As a child i was very awkward, both physical appearance and personality. Add that to my father only allowing me to wear skin tight jeans or short, shorts to school and it's no surprise that going through my adolescents and puberty i was no only undesirable, but mocked. That's when the fantasies of typical relationships warped in my head. The only way i could rationalize someone wanting to be with me was against their will.
However, it was never in a rape-like situation. That didn't help until i hit about 18 and moved to a new city where no one new me. I was actually able to get in consensual relationships with people i like. However, the first few girls i was with were huge into bondage and rape role play. This accelerated my problems. Every time I'd become single again my mind would instantly revert back to non-consensual thoughts, only now in revenge.
Now, though, as i get older the thoughts don't stop. I am in a relationship with someone i love and adore whole-hearted-ly. But whenever she isn't around me for more than an hour or two, my mind wanders hard. Whenever I'm at work i fantasize about tying up and having my way with every woman i see and wonder if they would enjoy it. Normal sex is completely unappealing to me. Even when my girlfriend and i have sex, i have to fantasize that I'm forcing myself on her and she doesn't know. 
Like i said. I love her with all my heart, but i can't stop these thoughts. I thought maybe finding a woman whom wanted to live out the fantasy too might be healthy, but a) i don't want to cheat on my girlfriend, b) it's not exactly easy to find a girl willing to be raped for satisfaction and c) I'm afraid it will just cause me to further escalate into needing an authentic rape.

I need help... How can i be normal?

5,"Hello everyone! 
Lately, I've started back up with going to therapy for various reasons, one of which being that I had trouble regulating how I feel in my ""off-time"". I go to school full time and I work two part time positions, so I don't have a ton of free time (which I'm fine with, I don't have many hobbies or interests). Anyway, the issue crops up whenever I have more than 1-2 days where my structure is gone. I get very emotional, going from being visibly angry (usually in reaction to something and way over the top) to being somewhat fine a few hours later, to having a crying fit for a half an hour. I've relayed this to my psychologist and we've agreed that I tend to treat myself like a robot and try and stifle what I'm feeling for as long as I can. As a result, she wants me to try and ""get in touch more"" with how I'm feeling throughout the week. I was just wondering if anyone else had any similar experiences and how they dealt with it, frankly this is kind of new to me.

6,"I think I have some kind of emotional problems but Google isn't really helping as it's quite hard to explain.

I go about my day to day life in a kind of haze, nothing really effects me on an emotional level, decisions I make are through logic and generally I function quite well although have been on/off with depression since my early teens.

Sometimes something sets me off and I feel an emotion really really strongly. This time it was a song, Small Bump by Ed Sheeran. When I first heard the end lyrics I felt what can only be described as devastation. It's been on my mind constantly about this little baby dying and I don't understand why I'm getting this connection to it from. I've never been closely involved with anyone who's had a miscarriage. 

That's just a recent example but I'd like to try and understand why I can go 90% of my life numb and then it feels like everything catches up with Mr ü§ê",24Feb2017,2

8,"I have been suffering from depressive symptoms (Diagnosed as Mild-depressive disorder) and extreme anxiety, mostly in social situations (Diagnosed as General Anxiety Disorder) for the past 6 years. These feelings came about after I lost a good friend through suicide, and broke up a long-term relationship on which I had become heavily dependant on my girlfriend at the time for social engagement - these events triggered the beginning of substantial alcohol and marijuana abuse which lasted around 2 years after which I began experiencing these symptoms.

Today I experienced a visual hallucination, star like lights shined brightly all across my field of vision for around a minute. This was the first time I experienced such an event - to my knowledge, having been on new medication for the past 8 days (Pristiq).

Is it likely that I have been misdiagnosed? Is it possibly Scizophrenia? From what I have read outside of being totally delusional the disease seems to fit my symptoms fairly well. The lack of clear thought processes, disorganisation, lack of motivation, inability to experience pleasure, little emotion etc.

I had accepted my initial diagnosis but today's events have me considerably worried.

A little advice/help would be appreciated.",24Feb2017,2
9,"Ever since I was a child, my parents wanted me to be a superstar and I learned that my value is based upon me performing. I'm a millenial by the way (26 years old). I have deceived myself into thinking that I am smarter or better than other people and I have gotten my self-worth from working in lab positions and around academia to have titles like grad student or research assistant in order to feel important. I tried to go to medical school because other people (family) wanted me to and I committed to a phd program but never went so that I could feel okay with myself. I just feel completely full of shit, and I'm coming out of the closet on this. I don't want to have to feel better or to derive my self worth from achieving in school. 

I am so vain and feel quite pathetic, that I have been so addicted to getting As in school that I will drop out of school and be distressed if I got a B. (I dropped out several times) .  I feel like the most pathetic person to say that I have been addicted to getting good grades in school so much that I will drop out of school if I am not going to get good grades. I have intense anxiety where I can't sleep or sit still for days and then leave school. My life is unstable and I am still dependent because of this. I got my Bachelor's, but I am still struggling.  I would never kill myself, but I understand why people do. I am just so frustrated with myself, I feel like a broken person. My anxiety is just a way for me to avoid accepting the fact that I am average or may struggle from time to time, and that I am no genius.

I've spent so much time obsessing about grades and using that to create my self-worth that I feel empty now that I am coming clean. This is a step in the right direction. I want to shake this feeling, but I don' t know how I can do it.  I am depressed because I haven't been able to create value for myself in this manner.

11,"Hey, rough stuff has been happening around me with peoples emotions flaring and fists swinging, along with choices being made purely by devotion to the family vs what should really be the choices made.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As in this case:
A is the mother of B, and sudo-wife of C(17 years together), but B causes all the trouble in the world along with about 100k in debt caused, and now B attacks C in his own house over social tension since A insists that B stays there for a while.

A and C now have great tension because of this. A wants to be a devoted mother and NEVER let B go, as a saint-mother cliche would. C wants A to realize the truth of how worthless B truly is after literally his whole life not learning a god damn thing, and using everyone for everything they have, including them.

Then there is D. That would be me. I grew up mentally older than my age, and was still treated as a child regardless, never taken seriously, even a little bit. Rage took over in such cases and eventually I was forced to join a ""GROW"" school during my late grade school years, until High School when I joined a high end school and passed with average grades.

During the ""GROW"" school, for trouble making individuals in schools(my ""unreasonable anger""), they constantly treated me similarly, looking down on people and not believing a word of it. Always with the stance of ""If someone was involved in any issue, both are punished"" rules, causing serious issues for more honest individuals like myself trying to get by in an adult-liberal fueled world, where crime realistically does pay in the long run as long as it's not life sentence worthy, and social issues always work out for the real bad character involved.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This created a split between my mind and my emotions. Ever since my second year in that school, I have normal rational thoughts, and emotional thoughts/urges at the same time, but the rational mind doesn't allow emotions through unless it is willingly, and contemplates on the emotions, which hardly matter in my head at this point. Not to say I do not have fun, or have interests, but that at any time I can decide to completely ignore them if I want to. 

Now-a-days it would be impossible to upset me. I feel rage and hatred for individuals just like anyone else, but I can very easily and with no issues talk and do things with them. I would rather NOT be anywhere around them, so the negativity in my head isn't even an option, but my rational mind over-rides all else, and emotions are only fuel if they are wanted to be used by myself, willingly. 

This is far different than most people from what I've experienced, and has inevitably lead to few friends(not that I mind) and a wise individual. I feel I can know the correct choices in my life or for others, both emotional choices and rational, for anyone I meet, while at the same time see what every emotion inside of me wants to do about things around me. 

I am extremely good at picking up what others would do and feel about any action or words said around them, from any individuals I know. I took Drafting in my High School courses, and my unique mental state thus far has allowed me to imagine what any object or person looks like from an angle, including from internally, which helped a lot in Drafting. Kinda like Xray.

Is there a word for this state of mind? It's not split personality, as I don't have randomly different personas, and it's not Bipolar, flip flopping between egos, it's more of an arbiter/bystander state of mind. I just don't know any terminology for it, and wonder what others think about this.

As an example of what I think about at a random time:
&gt;A square object with a square hole through it
&gt;Every angle of that object, included with dashed lines, to show internal shapes of the hole.
&gt;Rational thoughts about measurements and dimensions of the object.
&gt;What each of my emotions thinks about the object, and what they think about my other points of views.
&gt;Another rational mind thinking about my thinking process, and about what the views mean.

TL:DR Strange mental state developed from dumb societal problems/views. Multi-layered thinking, hyper sensitive capabilities for determining other peoples views and emotions instantly, among other things.

So what are your thoughts? Any terms you would use to describe this state of mind? How about questions? Knock yourself out thinking about it haha.",24Feb2017,1
12,"Hello,

Recently, I am being ""plagued"" by paranoid thoughts. I have always been a rather anxious and distrusting person by nature, but I am getting the impression that these thoughts became more intrusive recently.

Some of these thoughts probably stem from bad or ""traumatic"" experiences. For example; seeing a police car makes me imagine they are coming to get me to send me to a mental hospital. When someone gets off the same bus stop and keeps following me, I cannot stop thinking that the person wants to harass me.

These things are no fun, but actually happened before, which probably explains the fear. But other than that, I have also some thoughts which seem very irrational, as if they appear out of nowhere;

* Recently I was just sitting in a car, and could not stop thinking that, any moment, a van from the opposite direction with a long, sharp-shaped load on top would hit the side of our car, and the load would slide into the window the car I was in, impaling my head. I was truly afraid, even though I kind of realized it made no sense. Obviously, that did not happen.
* If someone calls me, and I do not recognize the phone number, I am unable to pick up the phone. I immediately think it will be some sort of malicious phone call, for example of someone stalking me, almost giving me a panic attack.
* I get an uncanny feeling when dressing and undressing, even when all curtains are closed. As if someone is possibly watching me. Even though that is impossible. At times I even think someone hid a camera or microphone in one of my rooms.
* One time I woke up and heard someone ringing my doorbell. I got up and checked but nobody was there. Kept hearing this multiple times that same night.
* Heard someone breaking down the lock of my door. I heard burglars talking in the hallway. Nobody was there or had been, lock was just intact.

Summing the experiences up like this makes it sound pretty bad, but it is not as if I am continuously completely crippled by fear, thinking everyone wants to cause me bad, spy or me, and so on. Nor am I specifically afraid of dying, or anything like that. These are just thoughts that occasionally pop up, even though at that time they feel pretty intense to me and I am truly anxious. But it passes, and afterwards I recognize that these experiences were not based on true events. I am not exactly sure what triggers these events exactly. However, feeling bad, stressed and anxious probably makes me much more prone to it.

Have you guys ever experienced something similar? Is this still considered to be normal? It this likely to go away on its own once my mental health improves, or should I discuss this with my therapist? I am not sure whether these are just some random harmless paranoid thoughts, or whether I am slowly becoming a bit schizo? I have already been on some different types of antipsychotic medication for a couple of years now, and still take an antipsychotic as of today.

Any advice would be appreciated!",24Feb2017,1

I was diagnosed with Bipolar II about 6 years ago. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8. I'm now 32 years old, and I take Lamictal and Some other stuff. 

Today, my psychiatrist mentioned that she thought I had OCD but she wanted to make sure it wasn't due to manic stages of Bipolar. I am hoping to get some insight to the disorder as I've always had an inaccurate opinion on it. I had foolishly thought that it only pertained to someone who must have things clean or organized a certain way. Apparently, I was very mistaken. Here's some of the issues that I have and I wanted to see if anyone can relate or if they think it's OCD as well. 

Every 3 months, I get obsessed with something to purchase. I get extremely anxious to the point where I cannot sleep. I'll purchase the item with little to no finances, but it relieves the symptom. I often return the items and buy something else multiple times. I went through 8 Mac computers in 2 months doing this. 

I become obsessed with hobbies such as gaming. I cannot limit myself and tend do focus on it constantly putting important things aside. I also get really anxious when this happens. I'll typically ditch the hobby a few weeks in and move onto something else then rinse and repeat. 

I triple check locks, my wallet, scratches on phone, smudges on screens, etc. 

I lose things regularly, lose track of conversations, get paranoid in public, and get bored easily. 

I have a tendency to develop bad habits like using tobacco, drinking, overeating,Undereating, then I quit, rinse and repeat. 

Here's the kicker, I'm not a neat or cleanly person by any means. Actually, things get pretty messy because I focus on other things that drain all my energy. 

Thank you for reading. I know it's a lot to help a random person on the internet, but I really would appreciate some clarity or your opinions. Does this sound like OCD? I do have obsessive thoughts that I don't want like lack of trust. Always second guessing myself and thinking people don't like me. I don't know. Some of the symptoms seem to match and others don't. 

I also have a history of self harm, and I'm tired of fighting this battle constantly. I see a new therapist next week to start focusing on treatment along with my Meds. Anybody in the same boat?",24Feb2017,2
15,"I'm 19 years old and my friend is 26, She struggles with everything from cutting to suicidal thoughts and even one attempt.  I only managed to stop the attempt because I had these same problems starting at 15 and recognized the subtle, signs the person was going to end their life over a phone call. After several attempts of getting her to talk to her parents in the middle of the night, I had no choice but to call 911( This happened last year). She was to scared to tell anyone and I couldn't leave her alone during the night because she confessed she might kill herself.  While I'm confident I did the right thing, she still blames me for calling 911 and still occasionally thinks about ways to get revenge on me.  I know that these thoughts are the mental illness talking and that she knows the reasons behind what I did, however, I also suffer from depression and anxiety so hearing that isn't always easy.  I know she is trying to forgive me, and that's good to know however there are more problems.  A lot of times she wants me to be her therapist because she has severe trust issues with the actual therapist and would rather just have me help and diagnose her instead. As a 19 year old with no actual credentials or training in mental health besides what I read on the internet, it is a lot to handle.   I tell her to talk the therapist about this because I'm not qualified but my lack of qualifications does not seem to concern her in the least.   In all honestly I'm really uncertain what to do about all this. I've suggested for her to get a job so she can go out and talk to people but she doesn't really want one right now and would prefer to just go on facebook and run a blog. (The blog is another concern of mine as I feel she is oversharing way to much to strangers on the internet but hell, I can't really stop her so.) Anyway I really need help. Having a job has definitely helped my depression and increased my confidence, but even then I'm not really sure if I'm strong enough to keep taking care of her, especially when I'm trying to get better to.

First of all i'd like to apologise for my english, i have yet still lot to learn.

 It's very hard to describe my feelings and thoughts but i will try to do my best, because i need small advice. I always had problems with human contact, never had many friends... well, actually in my entire life there was only one person i could call my real friend. I always lacked common sense and knowledge regarding social behaviors. Because of that my conversations with others were very awkward and kind of forced. It made me a person that wastes time on the computer playing video games for most part of my life. Fear of being rejected or laughed at was always around when i was going somewhere or speaking with someone. Hell, for very long time i was scared of eating in public but it kind of faded. All of those things look just like i'm awkward or maybe have social anxiety.But what bothers me is, last year because of moving out of my parents i was forced to have more interaction with others. It showed me how clueless I am when it comes to conversation. I made many mistakes and hurt many people completely unconsciously. 

Very often i feel like i am caged inside my body, there are thoughts and feelings inside of me which i can't or don't know how to express. I feel like a fkn rock, motionless and emotionless, pushing away everyone who wants to help me. For good chunk of my life i had those ""fantasies"", I still have few of those that have the same stupid,laughable ""plot"" since my childhood. I thought that it's normal, but they started to be more and more annoying. Before I mostly had them while i was going to sleep and sometimes mid-day. Now I am all the time day-dreaming in public which, trust me, is very embarassing and scary. My friend suggested that i may have schizoid personality. I know that self diagnosis is wrong and should be avoided but it just fits my behaviour so well :&lt; . The worst thing is im continuously switching between states of complete despair of whining and self-pity and state of not giving a fuck about anything in which i just can't force myself to do anything. It scares me, because when the ""void"" comes i dont know whether im making this up or not. This is why ive never really talked to anyone about that. When im miserable i cant force myself to talk to anyone about that and when it fades i feel like im doing this only for attention. The funniest thing is i know that many of you will think that im just an attention seeker who only wants compassion. But it's not true, i really want to figure this out, whats going on in me. Is it normal or I am just broken? I have an appointment  on 15th of march with psychiatrist. But I am scared that he/she will tell me that there is nothing wrong with me, or worse i wont be able to express my concerns.

Anyway, I'm trying to choose who to go to and am running into some roadblocks. How do you decide who to go to? 

Sorry if this has been asked before. I've been using https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/ and there are lots of descriptions of their qualifications outside of psychiatrist/psychologist (eg: counselor, licensed professional counselor, licensed clinical professional counselor, licensed clinical social worker, and more). It also lists how many years they've been practicing. 

I've also been putting a chart together with the issues I think I'd need to discuss and trying to find people who cover most, if not all of my issues.

So, what's important to look for? Their titles, the number of years they have practiced, or the number of my assumed issues that they list as having experience with? Most of the people I have looked at are not listed as a psychologist or a psychiatrist, so that would really narrow my search. Thanks for the help.",24Feb2017,1

46,"the nightmare started when i was 16 and tried to kill myself. i was hospitalised and it was one of the worst and most painful experiences of my life. i was diagnosed depression, anxiety and agorafobia. i couldnt go to school because of social anxiety and panic attacks. my mother and therapist help me to finish school even i consider quit it million times. i learned at home so i didnt have to socialise with anyone. i tried to study at university, but because of my anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia i couldnt go to lectures. finally it got even worse. i had another nervious breakdown and thought that i will go insane. i was hospitalised again. now i was diagnosed borderline personality disorder ( although doctor said it was more like mixed personality disorder)  i dont think that diagnosis fit me. so i made a pause at my studies. i tried voluntiering but it just didnt worked for me. everybody keep tellin me that i should get a job but im very anxious about it. also im afraid that this would lead to another mental breakdown. but if i stay at home things could get worse either. im 18 living with my mother and sister. i really would like to be independent but dont know how to do it. still i searchin job even im feelin really miserable and desperate. i really dont know what to do with my life everyday seems like hell. im thinkin about suicide but it also seems pointless to me. im tired everybody keep tellin me that it will pass but thats nonsense. i tired always bein high on meds and of endless therapies. it seems that  i just cant go on with living

47,"I'd be a douch to say that I am humble and not a bad person. However I know for a fact that I get angry / upset and make rash decisions on minor matters. 

I am a project manager. I absolutely hate it when people don't do their simplest of jobs and be arrogant about it. Not just coworkers, same is the case when I see bank / cable company not following up on a service ticket. 

The reaction to above situations might seem normal to most but I really believe I can improve on my temperament and be more calm and collected.

How can I learn to ""sometimes just let go""..?

Thank you in advance.",24Feb2017,3
48,"Now i dont know if im sabotaging my life or if I'm trying to get better. I'm very depressed and I know the alcohol isn't helping, but I think it's more of a symptom not a cause. I walked out on my girlfriend a week ago over not much of anything besides I don't feel like we're very compatible anymore. I knew this was the case before i stopped taking wellbutrin but once I did it got a lot harder to stand feeling like I was living a lie. I miss her like crazy now but I'm lonely and I dont really have a home anymore so maybe that's why I miss her so much. I'm not sure where to go from this point and I'm barely functioning at work. I do have a place to stay with a friend but I don't really like it. I feel like wellbutrin will help me feel more in control again but I think it makes me complacent.

I don't know what to do. I don't have any joy in my life anymore. I need a direction.",24Feb2017,2

50,"Ok so I have a family member who has been spiking everyday food items in the house with really strong sleeping tablets. I'm trying really hard to rationalise it but I cannot figure out why someone would do that?

This is a house where young children often visit and could easily ingest the drugs. The person doing it won't admit it and seems surprised at the accusations. It's like this person has lost touch with reality. There has to be some underlying mental disorder. But which disorder would it be along the lines of ?

I really can't get my head around this !",24Feb2017,3
51,"I was doing really really well since the last time I posted, I was feeling happy, optimistic, energetic. Now I am starting to spiral down again, my husband and I had a problem last night and it's really messing with me. 

Basically he said something that made me feel bad, I left the room and he came over to apologize but he was not really apologizing, he was yelling ""I'M SORRY GET BACK OUT HERE, I SAID I AM SORRY!!!! COME ON, I AM SORRY, LET'S GO."" I told him that he wasn't actually apologizing and to stop yelling at me because it wasn't making me feel any better, he stormed out. I told him after that ""You should really say sorry for yelling at me, that's not cool"" which he followed up with ""I'm not giving you shit!""

Why would you be such an asshole to someone unless you don't love them?

He's not going to admit he was in the wrong. I feel unworthy of love right now. It's really awful. ",24Feb2017,1
52,"I'm in a class this semester in which I need to blog about research that I've done via social media. One of my topics is mental health, and one of the blog posts I want to do is about the negative stigmas that have been tied to having mental illnesses.
I would appreciate it a bunch if some of you could list the following:
- Your mental illness(es)
- The negative stigma(s) you've heard about your illness(es)
- Literally ALL of the positive qualities about yourself that you can think of. This includes your character, your outer appearance, even little things you do here and there that you're proud of!
Everyone will remain anonymous, to assure comfortability.

Thanks y'all.",24Feb2017,2

55,"I have recently had a lot of troubles with my girlfriend who is diagnosed BPD. We have been through many rough patches and she only seems to be getting worse.  Her self harming has increased and she has lied to me about the frequency of her drug use. For a while I was putting up with it due to the fact she had started an argument a few months back that ended in her turning it into a physical altercation, so I felt nothing else could happen that would really effect me. 

Today I had a breakdown at work because she had snapped at me in the morning over nothing, which was me getting paid. I have had a history of depression since 13 (now 20) and have had suicidal thoughts for months, before and after the altercation previously mentioned. I left work early and was admitted to the emergency care at my local GP, where I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

During the doctors visit she asked me questions about my mental health and voices, checking windows etc. Where I realised these questions she was asking me, I had an answer for them. This worries me greatly. I've previously tried to talk to my girlfriend about my problems however she doesn't believe me. She is in denial that I have anything wrong with me. I gave up eventually because I didn't want to get her down with the problems I'm having. 

She rang me today shouting at me because I was 'ignoring' her calls when I was at the doctors. When I tried to ring her back ( I had hung up because she started shouting accusing me of lying about my problems) she just ignored me rejecting the calls. I can't take it any more, yet I don't want to face the consequences of her flipping if I cut her out of my life, which she has done before. I'm not new to people with BPD so I know how they act, I just feel I am on the breaking point.",24Feb2017,2
