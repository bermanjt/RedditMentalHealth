2,"On 150mg Wellbutrin/Bupropion and 5mg Cipralex/Lexapro

&amp;nbsp;

I noticed that when I don't take my antidepressants I see life much more realistically, I'm more ambitious and studious. However my lethargy, sadness, emptiness and loneliness starts to grow more and more and I fall again in that hole of depression.

I have exams starting in ONE WEEK, last year of university and in a top ranked institution yet I procrastinate on a regular basis, always tell myself I'll do it later or tomorrow and I've been 3 weeks on study-holidays now and haven't done barely anything.


I need to take them as they help me not be sad but they turn me into a lazy careless being.

Some people mentioned it's lexapro, can I take wellbutrin on it's own ?

Told Dr, but all he said is exams are not everything in life and to chill. Mental health is more important etc etc etc
Yeah sure, easy to say when it's not your 2nd year failing and all the costs that come with it.

3,"Ever since I was really young, I've been known as the ""crazy"" guy by my various friends and most of the time I was just a playful thing. However, I think now I actually do have some kind of mental issues for a few reasons. The most prominent thing is that I frequently fantasize about hurting people. I'm in good enough control of myself that I can't see myself doing anything violent, but the fact that I wish I could is definitely not healthy. I don't get angry very often, but when I do, I get absolutely furious to the point where I've broken things, yelled at people I care about, and generally act in a way that has genuinely scared people. Despite this, this anger goes away within literal seconds. I also tend to have a very narcissistic view of myself, feeling like I'm better than nearly everyone around me, although sometimes I'll briefly start to reflect on all of this and feel like I'm one of the worst people I know. Generally I'm a happy person, but these issues are always lurking in the background of my mind. I really just want to know why I'm like this. ",24Apr2017,1

7,"I'll put the TLDR at the beginning: Her anxiety issues at work are ruining most aspects of our lives and our future. She can't/won't take strides needed to fix it. I'm considering last ditch attempts to save this before leaving. WTF do I do?

Been together 4+ years. We've been engaged for about two of those years. Yes, when I proposed I knew she had mental health issues (at the time it was a bipolar diagnosis, but since then that diagnosis has been changed to PTSD I guess? Might be anxiety. We're too poor to get her consistent treatment and the affordable mental health services around here suck, plus she refuses to take most medications the doctors recommend at this point because all the stuff they experimented with before made her physically ill). 

Anyway, she's trying to get back into school, but it's tough because she has to work as well. The job she's at now is abusing the fuck out of her, not respecting the hours that they originally agreed upon, and so she's waking up at 4:15 in the morning 6 days a week. Granted, she's only working until maybe 10:00, but she needs a mental break from time to time in order to get her school work done and also get a break from the people. She avoids confrontation and won't stand up for herself and demand the original hours agreed upon, or even the 10 minute break she's entitled to (or the lunch break she's entitled to when she works the occasional 8 hour shift). She won't look for a new job because she insists that any job she gets will just pull this same shit so there's no point in bothering to find another one (she worked for a call center that DID pull similar shit). So at least once or twice a week we spend an entire evening after I get home from work dealing with a panic attack about how she's failing at school, failing at life, and how she's ruining our relationship and I'm growing to resent her. 

The unfortunate thing is that she's actually right about the last part. All I want is for her to be able to buck up, talk to her boss like an adult about this, or quit. I know that's not realistic, but it's crippling every aspect of our lives. I'm close to issuing an ultimatum (which I fucking hate), saying if she doesn't do something about this, then she's going to lose me.

I thought I knew what I was getting into when I proposed, but she was on the path to recovery at the time and making great strides. Things have gone backwards since then. I feel like an asshole for doing/feeling this way. I'll probably come across as an asshole for writing all this here and I'm really sorry. But I love this woman and I don't want to lose her, so please withhold judgement and lectures, and offer me genuine advice on how to save my relationship. 

Sorry for how long this turned out.",24Apr2017,1

9,"Hello.

My girlfriend has this thing where she wants to knock herself out so that she has a ""good excuse"" for not being able do the insane amount of work that she has. She already pulled an all-nighter last night. It's looking like yet another night of little sleep. She took 2 caffeine pills and considered taking more to knock herself out. And she even hit her head against a chair a couple times but couldn't do it any harder. She's been having a breakdown all day. We are several states away and I can only text/call/Skype her. 

She just confessed to me about how she hit her head against the chair several times (and about the caffeine pills). I have no idea what to say. Can someone help please? What can I say to her that supports her? Obviously I want her to not hurt herself. I just don't know what to say. I feel like so many things that I think might be a good thing to say would actually make it worse. ""Please don't take anymore pills"" or something might make it worse.

13,"First off, I am aware that any advice given to me through this sub-reddit doesn't substitute for professional help and am just here for other people's ideas for what could possibly be going on or what I could ask a psychiatrist about her situation. 

We have had our dog for about 2 months now and it has been going well. She is my girlfriend's emotional support animal and she has been helping immensely with her general happiness and stress relief as a whole. The dog is a rescue and is having minor difficulties with obedience, but overall it is going well through training. That being said, there have been three separate occasions within the last week where my girlfriend experienced the same psychiatric (edit: psychotic?) experience. 

The first time was when she was in the other room with the dog while I was preoccupied with homework in the bedroom. The second time was the next morning when she had dropped me off on campus and she took care of the dog in their morning routine. She told me about the two scenarios later that afternoon and we scheduled an appointment with her psychiatrist to hopefully get some answers. The third time happened just earlier tonight when I left them alone for a mere couple of minutes to pour a bowl of cereal and I came back in to her crying saying she did it again.

She does not consider herself suicidal and says that she doesn't want to die because she has many things to live for, but after choking our dog twice she had thoughts of what if she swallowed her whole pill bottle or crashed my car on the way to class. She also cut her arms a few times as a way of her ""making things right"" for choking our dog. 

She says that she has no idea how long the episodes last and isn't aware of what is going on at the time of it happening and it is as if something is taking over her. She retrospectively can tell me that before it happens her jaw locks and she starts petting the dog more and more aggressively and grabbing her skin until she finally is choking her. She then snaps out of it after an amount of time she does not know of choking the dog. She told me tonight after it had just happened that after she stopped choking the dog she still felt this irrational anger to choke the dog. I asked if she felt that aggression towards me or other animals and she said just the dog. Just so it is clear, we both very much love our dog and she is a huge blessing in our life and we take very good care of her and we show her an immense amount of love. This phenomenon is very recent and very abnormal and almost certainly related to her mental illness. 

Sorry for the length of the description, but I feel the situation is more clear now. Does anyone know of any mental illness or anything at all that could possibly explain what is going on if not just for my sake as trying to figure out how to keep my girlfriend and my dog safe? Any advice on how to tell my girlfriend that she can't be alone with her ESA dog until we know what is going on? She also broke out in a rash of red bumps throughout her body tonight around the same time as the incident and I'm sure its coincidence but would not like to rule out a possible physiological explanation for her aggressive episodes. Thank you in advance.

Edit: my girlfriend is diagnosed with depression and anxiety by her psychiatrist.",25Apr2017,2

29,I've battled OCD for a while and fortunately it doesn't have the same impact on me as it used to. I used to worry call day every day for the course of a year that I was one day to murderer someone or hurt someone despite never acctually planning to or wanting to. It lasted a long time but only took a few days of CBT to remove the viscous thought cycle from my mind - plus I did it all myself. I saw a therapist once and I felt that I didn't really need him as we both agreed that I understand how to combat OCD. But getting back to normal life has been hard over the last few months. It's only just dawned on me that I went from panicking every minute of every day for a year to having minimal panic. But I feel like I've been left with some kind of trauma from it. I doubt it's PTSD and the only thing I am relate it to is derealisation. I feel really off and not normal. The world seems bland and scary. I get really uncomfortable thoughts on money and growing up. It's just really weird. Some days I feel I'm developing psychotic symptoms and going mad. I remeber on holiday when the symptoms first arrived being so scared and out of it I didn't know what was going on. I still have some OCD but this thing is just so unusual.

31,"As far as I can remember, my childhood was spent worrying about things that children shouldn’t worry about.  I can remember at the age of 13, Easter morning, standing outside at my aunt’s house with my cousins, playing basketball.  My dad left early from the Easter festivities because a pharmacy about 15 miles away was open and was having a deal on an item.  At this time, I cannot remember what the item was but it doesn’t matter.  Anyway, we were standing there shooting the basketball around the hoop, and suddenly sirens filled the air.  Ambulances and firetrucks roared and raced down the main road.  The sirens wouldn’t stop.  Anytime they would shut off, they would start right back up again within seconds.  My heart began to race.  My first thought went straight to my dad being in a car accident and that’s why the sirens were blaring.  I tried to shoot the ball, I tried to busy my mind with thoughts of playing with peers, with thoughts that a child should have.  The sirens became louder and louder.  More and more firetrucks and ambulances raced by.  I began to start sweating, shaking, and eventually broke down and began crying.  
	I remember this moment as being my first ever panic attack.  As I was crying, a grandmother of my cousin came to me and asked me what was wrong.  After all, what could be wrong?  We were just standing around shooting basketball and playing in the driveway.  I explained to this woman my concerns of my dad being in a car accident.  She looked at me puzzled and walked me in to the house.  When we got in to the house, the rest of the family was having a good time.  I remember laughter and conversation happening in the upstairs of the split-level entry home.  I went straight in to the downstairs where I found myself alone.  I sat down on the couch and looked out the window, hoping to see my dad pull in the driveway soon.  As I was sitting there peering out the window, I had overheard the grandmother explain to my mom that I was downstairs crying because I thought my dad was in a car accident. 
	Moments later, my mother would come downstairs to find me crying.  She talked to me with an annoyed tone in her voice.  “What’s your problem?” she asked me as the sirens finally started to dissipate.  I told her what my problem was, I told her why I was worried.  I hoped so much in my mind that she would understand.  But of course, she did not.  I was called a baby and was told that I needed to grow up and act my age.  She asked me why I thought these thoughts just because I heard sirens.  I told her the truth.  “I don’t know.”
	Not much longer after this event, my dad would come pulling down the street.  I was still downstairs.  I felt a sense of relief.  My dad came in to the house and went upstairs.  I overheard my mom telling him that I was downstairs crying, worried about him, in a mocking manner.  He didn’t say anything.  He didn’t come to ask me what was wrong.  They didn’t take my anxiety towards the sirens as an actual issue of mine.  Soon after, we would leave my aunt’s house where I would be ridiculed in the car by my mother for crying and “putting on a show”.  I wasn’t putting on a show.  I was having a panic attack.  It wasn’t dealt with properly.  I wasn’t talked to about why I was having the feelings I was having or why these thoughts were in my head.  I was merely told to “grow up” and “act my age”.
	We went home and the story was never brought up again.  It was swept under the rug.  I was an embarrassment to them.  My anxiety was not something they were willing to deal with.  I would soon get worse.",25Apr2017,2

34,"I think that I have been struggling with alcohol and drug abuse for a few years now, but never realized it until a year ago. I blacked out in front of my girlfriend and her best friends and incoherently cursed at them. Nothing overly dramatic or violent at all, but I was beyond embarrassed. This sent me spiraling into a depression and I stopped drinking for a time. But after the sudden death of 3 friends, I fell back off the wagon and started drinking heavily again. It was different this time as I drank less frequently but, when I did, I would go way too far with it and black out way too often. This sent my anxiety and depression skyrocketing as I would have panic attacks every time I would drink too much and wonder what happened to me (I had an irrational fear every time that I had somehow contacted HIV), and I would compound my depression by staying inside for days at a time because of embarrassment. My girlfriend was also addicted to drugs and alcohol during this time and made everything ten times harder for me as she definitely instigated me and did the opposite of helping me get my act together by being abusive and lazy. This finally boiled over one night when I got drunk and suicidal and basically just drank and took drugs until I almost OD'd. I finally woke up and saw that I was killing myself with my addiction. I broke up with my girlfriend soon after and was on the path to getting better until I found out that she was sleeping with a good friend of mine (we dated 5 years, so that hurt). This sent me spiraling again and I started abusing coke and alcohol for another month straight until I decided to just take a month off and go home to see my parents and friends and get my mind right. That was all fine and dandy until I decided to go visit one of my bartender friends from college and of course I ended up on another 2 days coke and alcohol bender where I blacked out both nights and gave myself panic attacks because I dont know how I got home each night.

Now I sitting here 3 days later and my depression and anxiety are unbearable. And I know I need help for that and for my drug problems. I cant stop wondering what happened when I was black out and keep calling myself a piece of shit, even though I know I took an uber home both nights. But what do I do? I think Im losing it and Im too poor for therapy. Im a pretty good looking and charming guy with a decent job so absolutely no one can actually tell that Im going through some major shit. Most of my guy friends just want to take me drinking or get me high. And most of my girlfriends are so engrossed in their own relationships that I can tell that theyre just waiting for me to stop talking so that they can start venting about their respective boyfriends. I feel trapped. And maybe I was on the right path and I just relapsed once and need to just really take control of my life and understand that I am killing myself every time I drink, but part of me knows I need help.

What should I do and what are my options?

A couple weeks back he started claiming some ridiculous things, stuff about a friend ""gas lighting"" him and psychologically manipulating him. Some stuff went down and he ended up admitting himself to an ER and spending a week in a psych ward. 

Fast forward to now, he's been diagnosed with bipolar and seemed to be doing fine with the meds they gave him, realizing what he had been saying was delusion etc. But he just recently called me trying to explain how he really was being ""psychologically manipulated"" by this other guy, and that its really true. He's a smart kid, and I really want to believe him but he talks in very vague terms and other mutual friends tell me he's been saying some sketchy stuff recently again too. I don't really know what to do to help him, the psych ward sounded like a prison that did absolutely nothing for him, and it doesn't seem like the meds are working either.

I came across this app called Mood Triggers that can help your regulate emotions. And I thought I would mention it in case it could help someone. The app helps you identify the triggers of their anxious and depressed moods in order to better understand what is triggering them so you can break the cycle. It was developed by a team of researchers in the psych department at Penn State University so it's pretty legit. It's free with no ads which is a plus.

""Sometimes I think people are aliens or like, creatures in disguise as people trying to take over the world, and sometimes I think my family was replaced by them.  Other times I think people are actively working together to make me kill myself or to drive me crazy, or that they'll hurt me, even if they would never hurt actually hurt me.  Sometimes I'm scared to look at the sky because there are cameras and UFOs and if I look at them and they see me, they'll kill me because they know that I know they're there.  Sometimes I think street signs are messages to me, like stop signs are telling me to stop looking for signs of the creatures or stop talking about them.  Sometimes I hear whispering or crying, or barking or screaming when nothing is happening.  When this kind of stuff happens, I do irrational things like try to train my dog to attack people on command because I think they're trying to hurt me when they're not, or I boobytrap my house in case they're sneaking in.

Recently I thought my mom, her mom, her dad and my sister were conspiring, together, to make me think I was crazy and having false memories and trying to convince me to kill myself.  They weren't, none of that is true, but I cut all of them out of my life for a while until it just kind of stopped and I came to my senses.  When I was a kid I thought I had powers and that I could see end of the world, that I was vampire sort of thing, and I *might* have actually like, fabricated memories to support those powers being true.  Like predicting my friend's death before she died, I remember doing that but it's not really possible that it happened, right?  I don't know what's wrong with me, but that's what happens and if I don't get help I'm going to end up hurting someone or killing myself so I don't.  My family doesn't take me seriously, I can say outright that I'm having hallucinations and tell them why I'm too scared to go outside or look at the sky, and they just don't care, I guess, or they don't think it's a big deal, but someone will get hurt if I stay like this.""

49,"I've been thinking a lot recently about sharing what I've experienced with my own mental health. In the past few weeks I've seen friends form IOPs (intensive outpatient programs) that I've been to posting positive posts about mental health, have seen new stories about campaigns that other countries are launching and what other states are doing as well. I hope this isn't long winded - like I said, it's kind of something that's been on my mind for a while. 

I always remember being the problem child, the kid that got picked on in school - didn't matter if it was grammar school, high school or college, I was the target. It was as if I had a target on my back - I didn't always realize something was off but I think other kids my age could sense that I was different. This isn't about bullying...this is about realizing later on why I always let myself roll over onto my back and take it. 

My mood changed a lot as I got older. It wasn't just being a bitchy, immature teenage girl. I'd go into rages, feel my heart pounding in my chest. I'd have panic attacks, cry for no reason etc. I would go from being a good student to failing classes. Everything was just so inconsistent. I never really thought anything of it. When college came around in 2007 it was a complete disaster. To add insult to the injury that my social anxiety already gave me, I was almost sexually assaulted by a classmate. My world came crashing down around me and I started losing focus of who I was and sometimes didn't know where I was, didn't have a good concept of time. Again, I still didn't have a light bulb moment where I thought something could be wrong. I saw a psychiatrist while I was away but he thought it was just depression. 

Fast forward to 2012 where things never really changed and doctors that I saw still only suggested depression and anxiety. I was prescribed Prozac and Remeron simultaneously and I felt zonked all the time - I even dissociated. My legs and arms didn't feel as if they were my own. Next med up was Wellbutrin and I had a full blown manic episode. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and tried many other medications including Latuda and Seroquel. I only finally got on a regimen that worked a year ago and it's holding strong. I was hospitalized two years ago and I haven't had any symptoms that devastating since then but it is a constant struggle. 

It's hard never knowing how I'm going to feel. I can be happy and depressed in the same day. I've gained weight and can't get it off. It's very hard to focus and I don't have a great memory. At the same time I know that there are millions of people who have it worse. I am blessed to have my mental illness under control. I think it's heart breaking to think of people worse off than I am. I want stigma to end. I think there still needs to be improvement. 

TLDR: I've suffered from bi polar disorder and anxiety my whole life. I've been inspired lately to share my story. I'm lucky enough to have help when I need it but I know that there are so many people that aren't and I want to do more to help. I want other people to feel comfortable too to maybe share their experiences.

50,"Shortly after graduation, I was in a not so good place mentally speaking. I was suffering from depression that fluctuated between mild and moderate symptoms. I was still contacting my friends and talking to them however because they went off to college as well they got a huge boost in self esteem because of the new environment, new opportunities, etc. They changed their style and as a result their appearance got a 1 up. Some got into relationships, others got prestigious internships and raised their ""social standing"" so to speak. When we met a year after college, the dynamic totally changed. Everyone was latently ""sizing each other up"" based on their accomplishments. I was by far the least accomplished in their measure. I was disheveled in appearance and did not do much in college. Almost immediately after this, they stopped inviting me to meet up again. Soon the calls stopped coming and they stopped answering. No birthday wishes. No responses to my birthday wishes. From what a true and honest friend told me, they ended up deciding that I was ""unchanged"" and ""excommunicated me from the group"".
A year later, something really turned in my favor for once. Turns out I was a late bloomer and in the matter of a year my appearance went from looking like a high schooler to developing more masculine features and filling in substantially. My depression had lifted and I ended up winning an election and was appointed to a position 1 step below the student body president. I don't know how the information spread to them but apparently they caught wind that I had changed a lot. Then came the texts and the facebook messages asking me if I'd like to hang out with them, etc. What fucking shameless idiots. They thought they were hot shit and deliberately cut all contact with me and now that I got things in order they come back.
I wanna get some closure and send a final message before I stop communicating with them explaining how shameless it is of them to come crawling back to me after all this.",25Apr2017,14
