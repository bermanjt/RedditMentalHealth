0,"I can't think of a time in my life when someone actually came through for me when I really needed them to.  My fiance backed out of our engagement because in a matter of ten days she didn't want the life we'd been planning for the last three years.  After a year of struggling to make rent, I broke down and started searching for a roommate.  She gave me her deposit, I wrote the rent check, and today, 36 hours before she was due to move in (and after I've already cleared out the room and arranged all the paperwork) she texts me and says that she's not going to move in after all.

I've heard of Murphy's law, but even THAT speaks only of chances- ""if"" something ""can"" go wrong, it will.

The pitfalls and setbacks in my life don't seem like random chance to me.  They seem like insurmountable barricades into which I am steered, one (lack of) choice at a time, by some kind of sentient, sadistic all-seeing force of nature.  And then there's the people in my life that refuse to honor their commitments, adding yet another punch in the gut when I'm already reeling like i'm in one of those gyroscope rides where you never know which direction is which from one moment to the next.

For more than a year my life has been setback after setback- shitty temporary jobs, dwindling finances, people not following through on their promises, and things that would be minor inconveniences were my situation anything other than what it is cascading into full-on life-redirecting disasters.

I can't handle anymore of this shit.  I can't *afford* any more of this shit.  I've lost my health, my strength, my discipline, my passions, my loves, the bits of my life worth living.",03Nov2017,1,

5,"My brother is in a very bad psychological state. He is in his last semester of college, and in what appears to be a bipolar episode, has decided he wants to drop out, break up with his gf, and move home (mind you, he has great grades and job offers waiting after graduation).
He left school, and is now home with my parents. It is clear he needs regular therapy and likely some form of medication. No one if my family has a stigma about treatment. I have undergone these treatments. He was not raised in an overly masculine household where that would be holding him back. Still, he is disinterested in therapy and shrugs off the advice or concerns of others.

My parents repeatedly suggest therapy and medication to him but he shrugs it off. He is a legal adult, so there is nothing my parents can make him do, but he clearly needs help. What are strategies that can help him understand he needs to take these steps to get better? I don't think it is a matter of ""waiting for him to come around"" --his friends wanted to put him on suicide watch before he left school, and he is spending all day moping and playing video games. Things needs to change now.

I suggested a formal intervention to my parents, but they are worried this will make him angry and do something drastic. I am not sure what my options are. How to help someone who NEEDS help but is turning it away??

I'm from UK, college (high school for the usa) grade E graduated student from predicted A-Bs. I'm 24 now and this has been eating me for 8 years even though it should be no big deal.    
I see it as a failure and people around me who knows me all agreed it's no big deal and I'll be fine doing something else.    
It's less about the grades and more about how people around me took it.    
The fact that none of them recognise how it's important to me and I was not fine with it is equivalent to heartbreak.    
I understand this is a normal reaction but coming from a background of emotional neglect, this feels threatening. It build up from ""it's ok, life isn't defined by grades"" to ""As long as I am useful"".    
I've distanced myself from friends and families. I have no one to speak to without feeling even partially myself (the last thing you want is to breakdown on someone you're not even on first name basis).     
Every time I speak to someone, it takes a lot in me to put up a face and just be normal (not even smiling) but I don't feel normal at all.    
I know I have some sort of trouble with speaking because I forget words ""hey put that (table mat) *pause for more than 10s* thing away"".    
I feel empty and void more than depressed. I tried 2 jobs but failed to my decline physical and mental health plus finance (travel expenses). I have one now and my priority is to keep it but I'm struggling to simply physically get my ass into doing actual work (long term commissions). My boss having a crush on me is the only reason why I still have it I guess.    
    
My plan next year is to retake A levels to get the grades I need for the uni course I want (Philosophy) hopefully for September entry but I've been saying that for 7 years now but without a solid motivation, which I do now.    
To do that I need money for daily expenses and exam fees, amongst other important things (I have £50 to my name right now with few 100s debt I need to pay asap, living expenses atm is additional accumulating debt).    
I started this plan two months ago. Good progress mentally but no progress physically.
    
What I have been doing is denying that these people hurt me and I should confront it or move on, but just to have deny all this allowed this to manifest into many years. And knowing how people react ""just get up on your arse already!"" is damaging more than helping.    
    
I don't care how little you say because anything will help right now. It hasn't been a great past few days.    
Anything about sources I can look to, internet cookies, virtual hugs, I'd immensely appreciate it.",03Nov2017,1,

9,"I don't know what's happening to me. 

I'm constantly angry and bitter. I'm nervous and shaking all the time. The smallest things set me off. I pace around my room yelling and hitting/biting myself. Sometimes my mind goes back to highschool and I can just see them all laughing at me and gossiping about me, and I just know they're still doing it. I can't prove it, but i just know they are. The people at my work do it too. You can sit down and reason with me that they aren't. But something in me just knows they all do. 

I'm so anxious in every day life. I can't hold a conversation. I don't know how to read people, but they all read me so easily. I'm also constantly thinking about shooting myself. I play out a scenario in my mind where I go to buy a gun and shoot myself in front of all the people who I know are talking about me, and I get some sick thrill out of it. 

I think obsessively about why people are the way that they are. And it really starts to burn me up inside that I can't make any sort of peace with the world. I start to demand clear answers as if someone owes them to me. 

I have intense, and deep conversations with myself when im alone. I'll hear something really neat, or I'll have some idea i think is amazing and then i imagine explaining it to someone I know. I'l say it again and again and again, and I get a lot of entertainment out of it.

I feel so lonely in the world, and it makes life unbearable. But then its painful to have any sort of interaction with others. it all feels mechanical and scripted on my part. I stumble over my words because whatever is in my head just can't get to my mouth. 

I feel it has been getting worse day by day. I've done a lot of harm to myself from all the hitting and biting. I'm worried, but at the same time I'm not worried, because i often can manage to just laugh it all off. 

Is it possible I can just sit back for a while and try to figure this all out or should I see a therapist?",03Nov2017,1,

So me and my girlfriend bonded over opinions like white pride, and things related to it, we planned our future around moving to a mainly white town, and it all seemed pretty concrete. Last night we went to a church concert, and they started talking about sponsoring under privileged kids in 3rd world countries, so she started crying (i think) and took a pamphlet to sponsor a 5 year old in Uganda, which I thought was a really sweet thing to do. I guess that changed her mind on white pride and all that shit though, because now she doesn't like white pride, and it has changed our future, instead of the concrete plan we had set up, all we have is ""I don't know"". I can't stand that uncertainty and this rapid change, this might sound like bullshit, but it means I have to replan my entire future, and I don't know how to. I haven't had a change this big since my mom got heart failure and I had to miss school to take care of my little brother. I mean yea im depressed that she doesn't like white pride anymore, that's what we bonded over, and we could talk non stop about it, but the change is what I just can't cope with, I'm OCD and things have to be a certain way, I just get overwhelmed by rapid change like this.",03Nov2017,1,

13,"I graduated law school about 7 months ago. Passed my states bar exam with ease and got a nice job at a law firm that works me 60 hours a week. I’m only 24 years old and I feel like I have no life. I make comfortably over 6 digits and have a girlfriend but I never have time to spend money or see her.

At the end of a long work day which is 6 days a week I feel too exhausted to cope with even small things going wrong. For instance after having to explain to my client that they should pay a multi million dollar fine I just feel exhausted. Little things just set me off after that. My phone screen broke which is maybe $150 repair and it bothers me to a point where I don’t even want to continue my day. Thats just one example but it all adds up to depression. How do other professionals cope with the stress and do you feel like a high paying job is really worth it? I know I have regrets about choosing this path in life.

Recently I was admitted to hospital with psychotic depression for my 4th time. I have truly been through hell and lived to tell the tale. The delusions and paranoia I've had throughout my life have been horrific, and the suicidial ideation compulsive.

But through the help of my devoted family, friends, psychiatrist, psychologists and a mental health hospital I'm starting to see the light at the end of tunnel. I no longer regret not killing myself, and I feel pleasure in my life.

Mind you my life isn't perfect, I need to quit smoking, and I'm overweight and single, but things are good. I just want to help give hope to anyone struggling and wish you all good luck on your journeys. It's tough but I have faith you'll pull through.

17,"I'm going through some emotional stuff and wanted to write it down and perhaps get some thoughts and support and feedback. 

It was now 5 weeks ago that my husband and I broke up (after being married for 1 year). I essentially left him because I was feeling trapped and depressed and even though I couldn't figure out why, I knew I had to get out (you can see my previous post for more details on this part if you'd like). 

Now, over the past 5 weeks I've been going to therapy and had a lot of time to myself, and I've been working through all my issues - of which I have a lot, having been fighting my own feelings for so many years, through so many events. I've become more conscious of the things my husband did that weren't good for me, but also keenly aware that I need to learn to put myself first and take care of myself in a relationship. Now that I'm doing better, I feel like we could have worked things out, and probably still could. We could go to couples therapy and when I think about it, I honestly think it would likely all work out, and we might go on to have a happy marriage. 

I miss him. I didn't the first couple weeks, I was just so in shock, and then optimistic about the opportunities that being free and single proffer. Then I was realizing all the bad things about him, like how he would get angry, or how he wouldn't have fun when we went out and make me feel bad about it. But now I've started really missing him, remembering how it felt to be with him in all the good ways, like how he would hold me and smile and laugh with me and whatever, and how he really cared about me and was completely devoted and loyal to me. 

I guess it's just part of the grieving process. But now I'm in this state of doubt, thinking that maybe I can salvage things before it's too late, that maybe (though it's not at all sure) he'll take me back and we'll work things out together. But I don't want to initiate it unless I'm sure I want to, and I don't know that I'll ever be sure... I should probably just let it go, say goodbye for good, but I miss him, and so much of me wants to pick up the phone and bring him back and hug him. 

I know this is so classic, how do you ever get over it? How do you not have a lifetime of regret? ",03Nov2017,1,
18,"I posted this in another subreddit but I wanna post it here also. Someone please help me out.
A year ago I met a psychic and most of what she said was bullshit but she said she thinks I was sexually abused when I was younger and I was like what?? But all of a sudden my anxiety is bad and that's coming back to haunt me and I'm terrified I have repressed memories of childhood abuse now and it's taking over my life, I can't sleep or anything, I'm just analyzing my childhood now. I feel like I'm so worried about it I started making up fake memories in my head that definitely aren't real. I looked up signs of having repressed memories of abuse and I definitely have some, like I was afraid of the dark and stuff and I have body dysmorphic disorder. But I always figured I had body dysmorphic disorder because I was bullied ruthlessly for my looks my whole childhood and my mom always made me cut my hair short like a boy and people thought I was a boy. Anyway how do I stop worrying about this??? I keep remembering how I was interested in sex and stuff as a kid and made my dolls have sex, and other things I don't even wanna get into. 
There's only one person who could have possibly abused me, and I wasn't afraid of that person. If I had repressed memories of it, would I have been afraid of them or something, even if I didn't remember what they did??
Is it possible all the weird stuff I did as a little kid (looking up stuff about sex online etc) was just normal weird kid stuff that nobody talks about?? 

Another thing that made me scared is because I have health anxiety, and someone told me the reason people have health anxiety is because of sexual abuse. I always thought it was because many people in my family had cancer and I watched someone I loved die of it when I was a kid. 

If I do have repressed memories, I don't WANT to go delving into them, I'd rather just focus on the present and get on with my life. Can somebody please help me convince myself I'm fine??? I was supposed to see a therapist before but now I'm afraid if I see one they'll make me remember something I don't want to remember. 

I never found stuff in media about child abuse triggering or anything either. Like I could watch shows like Law and Order SVU and read news stories about things and not feel triggered or upset. Seeing bad stuff on the internet never brought up any memories. so am I overreacting and should stop listening to psychics??? I'm ruining my own life worrying about this.",03Nov2017,1,

The CO2 detector in my house would go off if we left the heater on for too long, so I'm wondering if long term exposure could have caused the hallucinations.

My feet felt like they had cracks in them, my joints were always on fire, and my back felt like it was going to break at any time.

24,"Hi all, 

I'm a 20 y/o female that has been struggling with crippling anxiety and major depression for the majority of my life. Over the last few years, it has gotten to the point where I contemplate suicide on almost a daily basis. I have panic attacks about every other day, despite being on Lexapro and Xanax. I just can't take it anymore. I'm exhausted.

My biggest trigger is the passage of time, thinking about the future, thinking about the minuteness of my own life, and most of all thinking about my friends and family dying. I used to be a practicing non-denominational Christian, but I've been working through a lot of doubt in my faith. I would never self identify as an atheist or a nihilist, but at this point I feel like that is essentially what I am. I need to believe in something. I don't think everything ever has all happened for no reason, so certainly there is a catalyst for creation, but whether or not It can still work in our lives is my question. 

Anyway, I'm wondering what religious practices, spiritual beliefs, or philosophies have helped you get through anxiety/depression/life. As I mentioned before, nihilism is kind of my trigger, so none of that please. Anything and everything else is welcome and helpful.

We both want a dog again, but have been putting it off because we’ve been saying we don’t have time for one. To be honest, we have plenty of time. There’s the 8-9 hours a day that we’re at work, but the rest of the time we don’t do anything. We have plenty of people to watch the dog if we go on vacation, and I think it would be a great excuse for both of us to get out and exercise with the dog every day. I think it would help both of us mentally, as we are both stressed with work (and with my depression rearing it’s ugly head again, I’m stressing him out more).

42,"ok so im naturally paranoid and have pretty bad anxiety to the point where if im having a conversation and get anxious i can start to stutter or just not make sense, if i start to not make sense people tend to stop paying attention which makes things even worse and i could swear at the same i here a voice saying things like ""your an idiot that didnt make sense"" or shit like ""thats it you fucked that up now he/she thinks your your an idiot but i brush it off telling myself its anxiety and its my thoughts racing but sometime i cant tell if it my voice im hearing or not.  ok now to what made me think i need to talk to someone, i could swear im being followed for the last couple days maybe a week i been seeing people that just stand out to me let me just say im good at remembering small things others wont notice. the first one was a guy wearing a wig which usually wouldnt make me think any thing unusual but THE GUYS STOMACH WAS 100% fake some costume type shit! day later spotted a guy in his car on his phone but it was angled straight at me being so paranoid i wrote the number plate down then started paying close attention to my surroundings walk for a while dont see to much unusual then happen to glance out the corner of my eye this guy drives past basically staring at me until turn my head and look at him he nearly snaped his neck looking away again get the number plate and WTF its nearly identical to the guy that took a picture of me, think about it over night.. next time i go out nothing unusual happens till the afternoon im driving with someone (they're driving) im casual checking every couple of plates completely convinced im being followed now and i see this car didnt take much notice until i realized he was in front of us a while ago and we were in the middle of a residential area so we were taking lefts rights constantly to get to to main roads wouldnt have thought anything of it but he stayed in front of us all the way to our destination which was about an hour away and slightly remote compared to were we came from. it didnt make sense for him to be in front of us all that time especially from where we came from to where we were going not to mention two other cars passing and droping back with nearly identical plates again! one of those cars had 2 men in black looking cats in it normal cloths but they looked so stiff with the same glasses on! at this point im straight up thinking im f**ed and they're gonna get me and i need to get ready DO SOMETING F**K.. i finish up what im doing an head to where im going ive just realized the last week or so when ever i catch a train two cats get on at certain stop but always get on the same car as me and sit near me no matter where on the train i am, they usually get off a certain stop today they were on the train till i got off and then it really got weird i didnt stick to my usual routine i went to visit someone was there all night when ever i was out front cars would drive past slowly usualy everyone speed on that street and then a van drives past slow as shit i dont say anything but the person standing with me does and the conversation changes, then later a completely different person says something about that same van i get all paranoid telling them to watch out for anything else an hour or so passes and we jump in the car leave the persons house i was visiting, i spot i car still running sitting in a football field car park i say something he doesn't say anything and we leave and go the opposite way go around the block because i was getting droped off at the station he drops me off theres already a car there that stands out to me driver just sitting there i look once and go about my biz thinking he's just waiting for someone to get off the train continue calling a cab and go into the bar to wait, the bar made me feel weird i leave before my cab is there to wait outside, cars still there go down the street a lil bit to wait for my cab takes about 30 min like a minute before my cab pulls in he pulls out and a suv pulls in that suv ends up driving past when i get out the cab(cant be sure didnt see plates) so i walk a different way that suv drives past and i go right and WTF another suv is coming up signaling to go down the alley i was bout to walk down so i stop and wait it drives down the alley so i walk down towards where i was going notice the suv has slowed down so i slow down it drives off slow as shit like its trying to see where im about to go (he speed into that alley like he was confident of where he was going so i asume it slowed down for other reasons) it turns i blitz threw a spot i know double back then blitzed to my destination SO at this point im not even sure WTF is going on im telling myself im actually being followed because if i was mentally unstable or ill wouldnt i be denying it or not even not notice somethings wrong.. am i wrong?  PLEASE any input would really help right now im sketched out as shit not even sure if im safe anymore ",03Nov2017,1,

45,"Constantly have this feel in my stomach that is hard to explain it’s almost like a sick feeling but not, 
Also when I am on public Transport I have difficulty breathing and feel everyone is watching me.

At night I get tired and lay my head on my pillow and all of a sudden my brain starts racing with bad thoughts and the worst outcomes of stuff, when this happens I find it very difficult to sleep. ",03Nov2017,5,

Later on I continue to do work but always end up being light headed, very unmotivated, face turns red and hot to the touch.  Is this normal? if so, will I get used to it? ",03Nov2017,2,
47,"hey everyone
i began smoking cannabis roughly a year ago (im 21 and f btw) and i had a very bad trip about 3 months ago. basically i thought i'm going to kill myself or someone else is going to kill me and that im being watched etc. i behaved very bizarrely according to my bf...
(my bf was ok, we smoked the same) it was just horrible and i also had panic attacks i believe? after that night nothing was the same anymore, i began getting these bad trips more often when smoking pot (but not as bad as the first time) and i stopped smoking altogether. and a few weeks ago i started getting these panic attacks as i call them without even smoking anything. its just scary and i got one today as well. it happened after i ate something, i was casually browsing the internet on my phone when my surroundings became wobbly and all the colors got distorted i felt like i was watching myself from a big distance ? its hard to describe but my field of view was also very distorted it looked like my phone was 5 meters away from me even though i was holding my phone in my hands...
the sounds from my tv were suddenly so loud i thought my ears are going to explode and im going to die.
all this came very suddenly and i ran into the bathroom and just sat on the toilet until everything slowly went away. also i started behaving weirdly according to my parents, i mean i was a pretty weird girl all my life but i get aggressive very easily and my memory got sooooo damn bad. my short and long term memory. i cant understand whats being said to me like i always hear something else e.g. when my mother talk to me. 
yeah i would just like to hear your guys opinion on this, if i should go to a doc, or just wait how everything develops. and im sorry if i made some mistakes, english is not my native language
cheers",03Nov2017,1,

49,"Hi, I just started Celexa this week. So far so good. I just feel like I've had 2 cups of coffee and someone swept the old cobwebs out of the happy part of my brain and switched on the light. Motivated as hell, and steady good mood. However, I wish could feel a bit more cozy and tired at night. I used to get sleepy/tired easily and even for no reason.

Any suggestions for getting that cozy feeling at night? Should I exercise during the day to wear myself out? Should I drink Sleepytime tea?turn up the heat?  I prefer any natural way to get tired. Thanks for your advice.",03Nov2017,0,
50,"It wasn't until recently that I recognised that I'm a compulsive shopper, it makes me feel good, especially when I'm broke because that makes me feel like I'm not broke lol. I also have this need to fill up spaces, needless to say I've built up quite the collection of vintage and antique items that I've developed unnecessary emotional attachments to.  I'm moving cross country next summer and I need to start downsizing now,

57,Hey all. I need people to talk to who have gotten through severe depression. Please message me if u can,03Nov2017,7,
58,"I switched psychiatrists recently because I am on new insurance. I was diagnosed with ADHD in kindergarten (my father and brother also have it) and OCD in second grade. Once, maybe in high school, a psychiatrist suggested that I may actually have mild autism (which might also explain my social awkwardness) that manifests similarly to ADHD and OCD, but that the important thing was to treat the symptoms, not name it, so my diagnosis stayed the same. I am now 27 and still have symptoms. I pick at my skin, I have trouble controlling the volume of my voice, I have poor social skills, I can't focus or I hyperfocus, I reread sentences because I didn't read it ""right"", I can't let go of details, I talk too much, etc... This new doctor thinks I don't have ADHD. She thinks it's symptoms of my OCD, and wants me retested for the ADHD. She also seems to think it likely that autism is the correct diagnosis. I've only met with her twice, and she only barely skimmed over my extremely thorough psychological testing from when I was 17, which said I had, OCD, ADHD, and dysgraphia. Within the first 20 minutes of meeting her she was suggesting I don't have ADHD. I have a huge number of the symptoms, and honestly considering I was around 5 when I was diagnosed it is part of my identity, along with the OCD. Immediately she was saying I'm on the wrong medications and wanted to change my prescriptions. I agreed to go up 10 mg on my Prozac (I was on 50) and keep my Ritalin LA as it was. I accidentally ended up taking only 40 instead of the increased dose, and noticed that I was basically useless at work, always distracted online. I was picking more at my skin too.

Today when I met her, we talked about this change in my symptoms. Now she wants me on 80 mg Prozac, to only take Ritalin LA once a day (it wears off for me in the afternoon, making it difficult for me to work) and prescribed me something called Ativan, saying it would make me relax. I just looked up Ativan, and I am concerned. It is only recommended to take it for a few weeks because it's addictive and you can build a tolerance, it looks like people occasionally take it for panic attacks from OCD but I haven't seen anything about someone with OCD taking it long term. It can make you drowsy, which is bad for me because it is only the Ritalin keeping me awake in the morning, despite getting 6-7 hours of sleep (I realized when I didn't take it I kept almost falling asleep at the wheel on my way to work). The doctor said that since I would only be taking .5 mg twice a day I shouldn't be concerned about side effects. She has also said she currently thinks I'm overmedicated. She might have a point, considering my Ritalin LA makes my OCD worse. She wants me to take the first Ativan dose tonight. Should I go pick it up?

Another thing that concerns me is that when I was hesitant to agree to a new medication I had never heard of before, she said if I disagreed I could see someone else. Is that a normal thing to say?",03Nov2017,1,
59,"So this started exactly a week ago today. I went to sleep, turned off the lights and went to bed. I rolled over and in front of me I saw a giant face with giant eyes and a smiling mouth (like the mask from the music video for ""I took a pill in Ibiza"" (Mike Posner)) staring right back at me, at about 10 cm from my face. I jumped out of my bed and realized it was just a pillow, but I was already so terrified that after that I started seeing eyes, shadows and faces all around my room. I tried my best to ignoring it but then I started hearing a really loud ringing in my ear. At this point, I told myself ""I'm done"", turned on the lights and wasn't able to sleep that night. Ever since then it has happened every night. Although I do end up sleeping, I have to do it with the lights on, because as soon as I turn them off, any shadow turns into an ominous figure, every shape turns into a face or an eye or a terrifying smile. Of course, because I leave my lights on, I wake up in the middle of the night and it takes me ages to go back to sleep. Not only that, because of the lack of sleep, I can't concentrate during the day, I get startled really easily and I am constantly tired. I can't take it for much longer; it is almost bed time here and I am so scared of going back to sleep. I've tried to talk this out with my housemates but they don't seem to realize the gravity of the situation as much as I do. I've tried looking it up on the internet and all I get is stuff about demons and sleep paralysis and apparitions from the other side, so not helpful at all. 

I'm currently in my third undergrad year (doing Physics) and although I am not actively conscious about it, I am under a lot of stress, not only because of my degree but because I am supposed to figure out what I'm going to do after my degree ends; I am also currently under an identity crisis because I hate my course more and more and I am also going through a bit of a crisis because I turned 20 last week (this might seem stupid but its very real). Could this have anything to do with these hallucinations? ",03Nov2017,5,

61,"I never really thought about it, but it was pointed out to me that I have no empathy for people, and come to think of it, it is true.... I have zero empathy for humans, even friends and family members. as I was thinking about this, it goes back to my childhood as well. all four of my grandparents have been dead for quite a while and as each one died when I was little, I felt no sadness or anything like that at all. my mother recently went through cancer and I did not feel sad at all; she was actually quite upset with me for not showing more emotion and condolences. whenever acts of terrorism or mass shootings happen and a bunch of innocent people die, I feel no remorse. whenever I see a bad car accident, no remorse.... however, I do feel bad for animals. I care alot about my cat and whether or not she is comfortable, happy, etc. Is this normal?

66,"Hi everyone, i have a question if anyone could help me make the following situation sound as clear as possible (basically explaining some personal feelings)

I am a 20m, who has been previously diagnosed with Aspergers.

I have been struggling for the last 6 years with my mental health going in and out of depression. I do my best to keep up, but nothing ever works out, or remains even though i try. I have no confidence in the future, and this will likely not change. 
I did everything in my power to enable myself to have a better life, but to no avail.
I dont believe there is anymore i can do more. 

I feel the compulsive need to do what matches the situation, even when the situation does not call for that/requires me to adapt/replan and am thus stuck in a constant loop. My head is working against me, out of compulsive need. I need help taking action, because i will not take action, even when its necessary/ wise for me to do.

Let me know what you think, thanks",03Nov2017,1,
67,"I hate this feeling so much, after talking to people these days I feel like a fool and t eats away at me for days. I lose energy because of it and need days to recover. I want to cry because I feel so stupid. Even eye contact now has become so difficult for me which was something I used to be proud of but now all I feel is stress and as if they're judging me with how I listen and talk. I feel so foolish. I feel like such a joke. Why can't I tell stories anymore either. I panic when someone asks me to say something and I clam up and lose breath and talk so fast and stutter. I'm so afraid of telling things to people and describing them. I'm afraid of them losing interest and nobody ever reacts the way I want or expect them to and it's so defeating. 

Lately I've also been having moments of pure emptiness and numbness and I often stare off into space and lose all care and feeling and motor functions(?). I don't know how I'm going to maintain a job or two to pay my bills if I constantly feel this way. I don't see the purpose of working, or life, I can't smile I can't move and I can't feel. I just give up on everything I'm doing and I don't know what to do. Or why this is happening.

I've also stopped caring about communication and lost the value in it as well, maybe due to the first paragraph. I don't talk to my friends anymore or my family. I feel there's no purpose in telling anyone about my day or hearing theirs. I just feel exhausted as if I'm putting on a show to be normal and pretending life even has meaning. My words will be forgotten and people won't care so why waste the energy pretending. So I can just go back home feeling exhausted and dirty? 

I haven't lost all hope in life thankfully, my boyfriend has given me purpose as well as my interests and dream s to be a video game designer but sometimes... it's not enough. I sit on our couch staring into space or playing games all day scrapping for the feelings of content. But I'm often feeling just so exhausted and numb and I hate it so much. I can't take it anymore. I can't take feeling like this anymore. I don't know how or why it got so bad.
