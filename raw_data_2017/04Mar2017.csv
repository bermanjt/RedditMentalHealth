1,"I will give a little background, i am a grown man, with a good family, i love animals and i always try to be a good person.

  Since i was 7 years old my mother and my father divorced,  i took it lightly but since that age i started having anger issues, i shouted to my mom and my grandma, i fought in school and things like that, in high school i took the rebel kid attitude but never got involved in drugs, alcohol or any of that stuff, i was stupid and shitty with people but was not stupid regarding my own health, i was in good shape and did a lot of sports.

  Everything changed when my mom met another dude, at first he was the man every woman dreamed of, he had good buisnesses, he gave us everything, life was changing a little bit to good, i got a little brother and i love him, a few years latter, i had a second brother, but my mom developed cancer, that year was a tough one, i knew my mom could die at any moment, and she had to travel a lot to get her treatment in another city, fortunately she defeated cancer, but things just got a little worse from there, this man, my step-dad was starting to show his real face, he stopped giving us basic things like food or paying the bills (he told my mom to stop working) and i started to develop a lot of anger and hate towards this man, we then knew that he cheated and that he had like 2 other families, at this time i just wanted to kill the guy, but i was not  stupid so i just kept my head low and recived everything life threw at me my grandma died in front of me, i really loved her since she was there from the day i was born, and at the end we moved to another city because my step-dad wanted to, me, and my mom have had a strange relationship towards this guy, i hate him with my soul but we just keep our heads low because he sometimes give us money, by the way my mom started working again so we dont depend on this guy anymore, but things are still rough to this day.

  So here is my main issue in my life right now, and the reason to this post, a few months back we got a little cat, i loved him so much, but the thing is i have always felt some kind of anger when i see cats do stuff, i said yes to have one cause i wanted to change that, i thought that since i have a ""great"" will power i could handle it, i was so wrong, when petting him, he obviously started rubbing his head against me and purring, but i felt something triggering in my head, like some kind of anger and hate vent realising, and i started choking him, to the point he was just having a straight look and he almost passed out, i felt like the shittiest human being ever existed, the weight of that to me was huge, but i could not stop, i had the cat for a week until i killed him, i broke one of his ribs, after doing that i was shocked, i ran him to the vet and they gave him something to numb the pain, he was at home the same day, and i could not stop crying, the same night he just died, i have the images printed on my mind and i gave him a nice goodbye, i felt like shit an entire month, no one in my family knows that i was the one taht broke his rib, just me and this is the first time i say it to anyone, i still have the weigh of it in my mind.

  And recently one of my girlfriends cats had 2 little kittens, i always played nice to them when i went to her home, but i was afraid she wanted to give me one, and she did, i evaded the thing for like 2 months, but then she told my mom about it and she said yes to her, now we have another cat, i just cant avoid doing bad stuff to him, i love him and i have contained myself in doing him the things i did to the other one, but this one now always run from me and that triggers me even more, i have tried laying down with him so i rub him but when he can he just tries to run away and shit happens, i handle myself better now, but i just dont want this cat, i told my mom that he is having issues since he is just in the house and he was used to being able to get out, i know i may go to hell and get the worst of the punishments, heck i just want to go to the french foreing legion so i can start my life again and maybe get killed in middle east, but my mother needs me to maintain this family, and i love my girlfriend so much to do that.

I will aprecciate any advise since i cant go to a psychiatrist due to money problems, i am planning in doing so, but i just needed to get this off my chest, maybe it will help.",04Mar2017,1

4,"It seems everyone's first suggestion for anxiety coping skills is deep breathing. I know it effective for many, but it does not calm me. I have tried a variety of techniques for extended periods of time, but a lot of times it only makes my anxiety worse. Anyone else find deep breathing ineffective?",04Mar2017,10
5,"I can't sleep. I thought things were going to get better. But I feel so bad and worried about things going on with me right now. Doctors said I have anxiety, but I think it's caused by the inability to think, and the inability is caused by something else.

Idf know what to do. I called some number my mom gave me, and they told me I have some probably psychological thing going on. But I don't trust anyone right now, because people are just shit and don't care about me, they're just trying to tell me to sit until something really bad happens and then to go like ""oh oops"".

i cant call a doctor, i want to sleep in a hospital hooked up to calming thingies please. how do i fix this. i already took 2x relaxen and 1x spitomin (to restart on the pills)

i haven't been on pills for more than 6 months and I was okay.

Edit: people are telling me i should just sleep it off, but i have no fking clue iof that's okay or what to do, i want to kill myself right now, but i dont want to die

Edit 2: I can't fall asleep, but im very tired.",04Mar2017,7
6,"My sister moved to the other side of the country for a few years, could not hold a job, and now she's come back and is living with me. She's been telling me what she experienced over there, and she is displaying downright delusional symptoms. I'm wondering if I should be fearing for my physical health since we live in the same place.

background: she was bullied a lot during high school and by our mom. she has no friends at all. she is arrogant. she does not handle criticism well. she is smart and does work hard, but seems to think her knowledge should override her social deficiencies. she is also fiercely anti-technology.

- her biggest insistence is that she feels like she's being persecuted by rich people/corporations. When she worked at a grocery store chain, she was bullied and eventually fired. She thinks this chain is now hacking her emails and phone. She worked in the restaurant business for a rich family over on the other side of the country, and she was also treated poorly and eventually fired. She also think this rich family is hacking her emails and phone, and is trying to drive her to commit suicide. When I ask her why she thinks this, she claims this family is obsessed with her.

- When she went to school, she left early because she thought the other students put a camera in her room. She now thinks this rich family is making deals with the landlords of wherever she lives to let them install cameras wherever she lives, to make her relive her school days. She also thinks all of her neighbors have access to these cameras. Today she wrapped tin foil around all the light fixtures in her room to block the view of these alleged cameras.

- She said she fears for her life. She thinks stalkers and serial killers have access to these cameras. If an ugly man pays attention to her, she either thinks he is a pervert or someone paid to harass her.

- She moved in with me a week ago, and now she's claiming that there is a camera in my apartment, all my neighbors are watching us through it, and that my landlord has been bought by this rich family. When I ask her what proof she has that the neighbors are watching her on camera, she says things like this: ""I once ate a large serving of meat last night, and then when I woke up this morning, someone outside my window was coughing and retching in the streets. He was sending a message to me that he had watched me eat the meat."" 

- She wants to go to the police with her story. I'm pretty sure she already knows the police is not going to believe her, because she is already claiming that, if they don't believe her story, it's because they've been bought by the rich family who lives on the other side of the country.

- She is extremely angry with the world. She rants and raves about what a vile bitch her previous landlord is because she believes her previous landlord put the camera in her room. She also refuses to pay the rent she owes to her previous landlord because of this alleged violation of her privacy. She says she hates all her previous neighbors for watching her on camera.

- I can't stress enough how socially inept she is. She hasn't had a friend since high school, and she doesn't keep in contact with anyone other than me. She also thinks people don't like her because, quote, ""I no longer own a car and I don't behave with the humility that a poor person should behave with"". Never mind that she owned a car during her stint with the grocery chain, and she was unable to make friends with anyone there either.

You get the idea. My concern is that, although my sister and I are on as good terms as we can be right now (I'm her only friend and family in the world), I am afraid that if she starts thinking I have somehow become one of her enemies, she will become violent. She is extremely timid and meek, though, so I think if she is going physically harm anyone, it will most likely be herself, which I also do not want.

I've heard that schizos can take meds to help their symptoms. Will meds be enough for a person with the depth of these symptoms? She says that this has been going on for years now, with the grocery store chain and the rich family. So this is not a new thing. She's been housing these thoughts and delusions for years now.",04Mar2017,9
7,"so, long story short I'm active duty, I got hurt and have been trying to get surgery and on top of all that crap I've also recently had some issues with some abuse I suffered from my mother when I was a kid. anyway so I work like 8-12 hour days and it's a relatively high tempo job (naval aviation working an active flight line) and like, for example earlier today I was filling out some paperwork and all of a sudden my mind just started like poking into the corner I stuff all the crap I don't want to think about in, and I don't know my chest just felt really tight, I kinda started to feel like I was panicking and like I was almost having trouble feeling (similar to drowning almost) I even started to tear up a bit but gladly only one other person was in the room and she was too busy to notice, I composed myself for what I could and kinda roamed around a bit till I ended up in an empty shop space, started feeling really worried and anxious and almost like the room was spinning till I slammed my elbow (which is the part that's injured and awaiting surgery) into a desk really hard, biting pain kinda snapped me back and I was able to calm down enough to get back to work. That's not the only time something like that has happened either, but I can usually calm myself down by pretty much the same way, physical pain to help ignore whatever it is.

so my dumb question is actually two possibly dumb questions, 1. what the hell is that? should I seek medical about it? 2. does that part about hurting myself to snap out of it, does that count as self harm? I'm not doing it because I want to hurt myself I'm doing it to stop myself from having some kind of freak out, so I can maintain some form of control over it.

sorry for the dumb questions and thanks in advance.",04Mar2017,8
8,"short version: I've lost the confidence I used to have and also feel like i'm losing my personality 

i finished highschool in 2015, at the end of it I was a very happy and confident person I felt so secure in who I was and it felt amazing but since I started uni in 2016 things took a decline. my highschool was tight nit, and i had a great group of friends. At uni i pretty much had only 1 friend who was very toxic and i broke off the friendship after 2 months. Since then i have made no real uni friends. I have friends who i see in classes etc but I dont have a group of friends i would hang with. I don't know if what im feeling would be classed as anxiety because i'm not sure how extreme it is. Basically my lack of confidence makes me feel uncomfortable and self conscious especially at uni like the other day i felt really anxious after a class and so i left the university and went home because i could deal with it. I'm introverted in the sense that i don't like partying or going out heaps but i love talking to other people in small groups etc and I hate going to uni because i literally go there and i am silent the whole time cos i have no one to speak to. I don't think I'm depressed because I'm genuinely happy with my life i just wish i had the confidence I used to have. Do you guys have any tips or advice for how i can regain my confidence? Also do you guys know any natural oils or herbs you can use for when you feel anxious, i have heard kava is good. ",04Mar2017,1
9,"I was in a pretty normal setting. I was at a college party and I was drinking and smoking weed but nothing else. Done this plenty of times with no issues. Shortly after I smoked was when my episode began. I felt pretty off so I started self-care: drinking water, getting some fresh air, etc, but it still got worse.

Basically I started to have a very difficult time distinguishing reality from my imagination. I started to panic and my heart began to race, and my thoughts raced too. Very early on I was convinced I was dying. I somehow started thinking that there was some deeper significance to what I was feeling-- that my deep seated feelings of dread and doom were a sign that these were the last seconds of my life. I was overwhelmed with despair about dying and I thought that my existential thoughts of death were going to break my hold on existing, that everything was about to end or change, that the illusion of life was breaking, something like that.

On another simultaneous level, a more rational but still paranoid part of me was worrying that my episode and racing heart beat was going to kill me through high blood pressure, and on a less rational level, a brain aneurysm.

I had a lot more thoughts during the whole drawn out episode. I thought I had to go to the hospital or I would absolutely die. When the emergency responders showed up and started questioning me for info, other paranoid thoughts came up in my head. One was (and it sounds so stupid now) that the responders were government agents coming to get me. I was going to be imprisoned for anti-government sentiments or something and nobody was ever going to see me again. Everything felt real, every thought I had felt real, I couldn't tell what was and wasn't and it was hard to ground myself. 

Other thoughts I had were: while hearing beeping in the hospital I imagined the beeping was a life support system and that on another level of existence I was a dying or comatose patient and that my entire life was actually just the dream of another person, who's life was ending and thus my universe/reality was ending.

I was convinced that my boyfriend was working with the police to interrogate me and trick me into revealing where I got the weed from for a minute when he came to see me. I shared the thought with him and that helped calmed my fears because he could assure me that wasn't real. 

Reality stayed blurred all night but I at least got past the false reality that I was dying or ceasing to exist. 


Now if I could only pin this on drugs that would be nice, but out of the four or five episodes I've had over my life, a few have been while sober.

And even when I'm not in full panic mode, I still struggle a little bit with reality things. Its easy to convince myself things, like that nothing around me is real, or that people can read my thoughts, that the government watches me, or that the dollar bill I picked up off the sidewalk was covered in anthrax. There's all this imagined false significance, and fears that things and patterns are actually supposed to mean something specific to me, like a message. Most of the time its really manageable and I have no problem grounding myself to reality. But rarely it just gets out of hand for me. This was the first episode that I've had in a year, and this was the worst one by far. ",04Mar2017,2

11,"Been this way since I was 10–11, I loved crimewatch even though it gave me nightmares. I also watched documentaries about serial killers and the Jeffery Dahmer one being my favorite. When I heard Dylan Roof was going to be executed I got excited. I also watched whatever court video I could find.

I also get angry at people who oppose the DP or call for 'humane' DP.",04Mar2017,2

13,"Background: 22y/o male, previously diagnosed with anxiety and depression which I'm in therapy for but no medication. Follow a vegan diet and haven't been taking Vit b12, vit d, or iron tablets for a few months now. Previously had a head injury.

Since my accident I have started to become very restless when I sleep: shouting, sleepwalking, attempting to climb out the window etc
This has been going on for at least 5 years now

Question: 
Previously after smoking too much weed, I felt like I was in a dream like state after I woke up yet didn't have any issues before then. Recovered from that.

A few days ago, I vaped  a very small amount (0.05g) as I'm extremely careful with my dosages now and only consume based upon my tolerance.

After this I felt the usual confusion and anxiety but it wasn't that bad.

Day after, felt a bit groggy but nothing really unusual. Had some caffeine and felt fine.

Now today, when I woke up, I felt like I was in a dream world, took a while to adjust to the room, ate some food and drank some water, felt better. Came into work and now I feel like I can't focus, like I'm extremely tired, struggling to hold a conversation at times because I keep zoning out.

What could possibly be causing this?

I hope I've covered as much background information as necessary, I've basically highlighted things that I believe could be possible contributing factors.

TL;DR: Can't focus, feel exhausted etc, what's causing it? ",04Mar2017,5

I don't believe there's any hope for me in finding a life partner.  
And I fear being nothing but a burden on the people I love only to still end in tragedy.  

I manage to enjoy in my day to day life regularly which is actually something I manage to live for now.

For additional mental health background,
I've also been diagnosed with ADD and take dexamphetamine which I've found has greatly increased my quality of life.

Found Ritalin ineffective in assisting with ADD.

I also occassionally suffer from fainting spells when standing too quickly.  I am concerned but hesitant to pursue this in fear it's related to my dexamphetamine prescription

I've tried a number of antidepressant medications and found none of them really worked for me at all.  The only one I can recall by name is lexapro

Although I have been diagnosed depressive I suspect I may be bipolar. 

Had some success with cognitive behaviour therapy.

Really struggle finding the willpower or discipline to do anything sometimes. 

How do I change?

What has worked for you?

Any advice you can give me will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.",04Mar2017,6
20,"Hi all.

I don't know if this is the right sub, or why I am typing this. 

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression 2 years ago now. It cleared up for a while but it came back worse than before last November, only to disappear again at the end of Jan, when I started to take an SSRI. Within 1 week I had stopped taking it, but since then I have been feeling literally the best I have felt for maybe 4 years. 

It's like just existing is euphoric. I see some illegible graffiti and get overwhelmed by love and warmth. I swear my friends are the best people in the world. I still get get low moods for no reason, but nothing like the depression I was in. I sometimes get the social anxiety again, but I can just tell myself it's all a matter of perspective and do whatever I wanted to. 

I have been getting in touch with old friends, having more fun, actually engaging in my degree slightly more. It's a cliche, but I am a new person. Let's make the most of it while it's here.

25,"Hi Reddit, I'm 23 and have almost no interpersonal skills. 

This is not a mental illness, per se, but it causes me to have no friends, which then leads to depression. 

How should I work on these interpersonal skills?

I was thinking speech therapist or occupational therapist, but I'm not sure if they're the right thing. For example, two local establishments are called ""Pathways to Speech"" and ""Total Education Solutions"", which sound like they're for children. Would they laugh their ass off if I, a 23 year-old, walked in to get therapy for myself?

Alternatively, I actually have a list of ideas for how to work on these skills, but I would need a facilitator to give me feedback and keep me on track. If I can't get professional help, I was thinking of finding someone on Craigslist or Reddit and paying them like $50 a week for a bit of facilitating. I feel like someone who studied communications in school and is kinda underemployed might be perfect for this. Does this sound like a good idea?",04Mar2017,3
