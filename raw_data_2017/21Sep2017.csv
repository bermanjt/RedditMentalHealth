2,"Hey, I'm sending this out into the ether and hoping that someone may either relate, or else just offer some black and white advice. I'm 24 years old and I'm having a bit of a hard time. Since as long as I can remember (early childhood) I've had issues with getting/staying motivated.  I did have a pretty rough childhood, emotionally abusive mother, physically and emotionally abusive father, both Eastern European so different world, different ideas of raising kids...both of them were a bit all over the place and didn't seem to be too concerned with the kids, Mom was very belittling, Dad was to be respected with no questions asked or else, etc...you get it...born and raised in the capital of Canada so this created a divide in me (eg. way I was with friends/way it was at home) I started skipping school in grade 7, dropped out gr. 9 and spent a lot of my teenage years getting drunk, smoking weed and doing whatever I pleased (age 12-20) never really learned self discipline.. sorry for the rant, just trying to give some background I guess. It's hard to pinpoint this feeling, but if I had to describe it, it's like I will get an idea, I'll get excited about it, I'll start making plans and having fantasies about the end result, but once I actually sit down to get going, I get this paralyzing feeling in my chest and all I can think about is how I can't do this, I can't do this, and then I just want to drink or give up. It sounds really melodramatic, it FEELS melodramatic, but I'm trying to express the way it happens. Even writing this seems really idiotic, and somehow feels like I'm screwing it up. Which is kind of absurd since it's an anonymous post on reddit. There's so much more to it that I can't possibly describe in full, in words, here. It's kept me from jobs, relationships, all kinds of potential opportunities. I'm a house cleaner now. I make my own schedule and I work alone. It's dirty work, but it lets me avoid facing the aforementioned issues. I'm a social person, I like to write (all though I haven't been writing much, nor reading, and my vocabulary and ability to communicate my thoughts with any real depth reveals this) and I have a million dreams. I'm a creative person but I just lie around and scroll on my phone avoiding doing anything. I can't afford therapy so I'm writing here, in hopes that someone may relate and offer me some advice. Even if it's the kind of advice that should be obvious, anything really. I'm just tired of hearing solely my own dialogue about this issue coursing through my mind, I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I know I need to make a step in some direction, but I feel completely paralyzed. It's like the solution is inches from my reach, but for some reason I can't break through the force field. Thanks for reading, and sorry for the mega rant. It felt nice to just write it, even if it doesn't totally make sense.",21Sep2017,2

4,"I have depression/anxiety and some could argue that I have PTSD from abuse as a kid.  Anywho....I'm in therapy and I have meds that I take for depression and anxiety and they work....I guess.  They don't turn me into the woman in the sound of music, but they make life a bit more tolerable sometimes.

Then there's days like today where I just get in a mood and I don't want anyone to talk to me, see me, even things that don't normally bother me tend to set me off.  

The meds I'm on are the only meds I can really take due to gastric sleeve surgery and type 2 diabetes, so what I take is what I take, basically.

12,"Hey guys, I've been thinking recently and I'm hoping to begin a podcast where each podcast involves someone telling their story of overcoming a mental health issue such as depression, anxiety, etc. It would begin with a basic introduction (no real names need to be used) after which I would ask a few questions (still working on what those questions would be) and then the main speaker would tell their story with the occasional question from me. The podcast would ideally end with the speaker giving tips or examples of their coping mechanisms that they believe have helped them. It seems like society is able to speak openly about a variety of topics but still remains largely silent when it comes to mental health. My reason behind getting people to tell their stories is to help those that are struggling with their mental health gain hope that things do get better. That there is hope and that there is no need to be silent about things. That their feelings are valid and they are not alone. If anyone has any suggestions or would be interested in helping me make this come to fruition I would greatly appreciate it, feel free to get in touch!",21Sep2017,3
13,"I can barely sleep, I'm having panic attacks for the first time in my life, I'm having night terrors, migraines, I've lost close to 15 pounds in a month and I have a bald spot from hair loss. I'm working with a therapist and a psychologist and they are considering putting me on meds but I'm afraid of what they'll do to me, especially if this is all concussion related. I don't know what to do and I need help because I can't live like this. I'm normally able to cognitively remind myself that I'm feeling extra panicky or anxious because of head trauma and it's my brain tricking me but sometimes it's just too much. Has anyone else experienced this? What else should I be doing? Should I be on meds? I'm just so concerned that if I do go on meds, I won't succeed in this last semester and I need to get good grades. I keep telling myself I just need to suffer until December but I don't think I'll be able to sustain this for two more months (not in a ""kill myself"" way, but there's no way I can maintain good grades like this for months).

18,"Hi and I hope this is allowed. I'm a grown woman and can't explain why I feel this way. I know **1** time when i was 14 years old I found my dad deep asleep next to me in my bed, which freaked me out since I was only wearing a tshirt+underwear. My mom said it was because he was very worried about me (i had chicken pox and at one point was so sick I passed out). Other than that my mom was one of the types who dumped everything on me about my dad since childhood, including telling me he liked porn too much (I found a pic of a naked lady on the computer once as a very sheltered 13 year old). I was NEVER molested to my knowledge. If anything he was a bit apathetic/disconnected at times, and it still seems like I do all the asking when it comes to having him spend time with us. Should i listen to my gut or am I just being paranoid? I was raised by a paranoid woman so it could just be me right? He's scheduled to babysit tomorrow, and i realized that my son will be at school and got very uncomfortable thinking about it. If he's there, I don't feel worried- my son is a very talkative/ assertive 6 year old who already knows bodily rules, and talks back to ANY adult he even thinks is teasing or yelling at his sis (including his own parents). I do not know why, because other than the crap my mom told me +that he wasn't super connected, he was a great father- a gentleman, the type who always helps others and shows/teaches respect.",21Sep2017,1

23,"I'm a seventeen year old senior in high school and I suffer from type one bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Despite being an A-B student, when I missed days of school due to my severe mood episodes, I was considered ""truant"" by the state of Pennsylvania. Although school and health care professionals were mostly sympathetic, their main concern always seemed to be that I was absent from school. It seemed the only way to get my absences excused was to attend an inpatient or outpatient program, which costs approximately two hundred dollars a day. Now, I want to ask, ""what am I supposed to do?"" I am currently trying to apply to colleges- trying to put the past behind me- and what keeps coming back to haunt me? The 30+ unexcused absences from junior year. The only ones I was able to excuse were those that occurred when I was hospitalized. I am told it was my choice not to go to school, that I have to accept the consequences for my actions. I was apparently expected to go to school after having stayed up all night hallucinating and cutting. What appalls me the most is that my release papers from one of the partial programs I attended clearly state that, following my diagnosis, I was expected to be completely incapacitated for a period of up to five months. The school district, however, refused to accept the statement as a justification for absence from school because it did not have specific dates on it. Despite the school district sending me all over the county, trying to find a school that offered sufficient emotional support to meet my needs (all requiring me to take a 3 hour bus ride every morning to go to a school that wasn't challenging enough academically or that only had violent students) after many months, I ended up cyber schooled (which is what I had been asking for since my release from the hospital and which the school district had been fighting against) and, in cyber school, I was able to complete my junior year with mastery courses. So, to be completely frank, I am far more grateful towards myself than I am to the school district. I find it shocking that my absences were treated as more of an issue than my mental health. The most important thing was to get marked present, even if I spent the day at my desk in a semi-comatose state or in the guidance office begging to be allowed to go home. Every morning I was faced with the same two options: ask my mom to let me stay home, and get into a draining argument with her until she finally gave up and left for work, or drag myself to school with my arms wrapped in gauze and my hair tangled and dirty. School went from being a necessary evil to the most horrible place on Earth. One of the things that I quickly got tired of hearing was that other kids also had mental illness and they went to school anyway. So I'm wondering, is anybody in a similar situation and does anyone have any advice for how I can get those absences recognized as having been due to illness and not just to me refusing to go to school?",22Sep2017,6

25,"Hello, to start I am going to say that I am aware that it is very normal for humans to have desires for killing, we are animals after all. However, I think my case might be different. And I also feel like I have many reasons for this desires. One of them is rage. I have accumulated so much rage in recent years from many things (I'm almost 100% sure I have rage issues) and no way to release it.

A contributing factor to this is my hatred for people has grown and for many reasons, too many to list really. I think there is still good in this world and there are some respectable, caring people but the ones that need to die outweigh the ones who don't. I know this is normal, many people kill out of rage and grief, but so is hating people but then there's more.

The pure desire of it. The morbidity of taking somebody's life away, to be in power, to have all their memories and achievements fade away in a second. To watch their horror and denial as they are about to die, and their naiiveness and innocence just moments before. I'm pretty sure this is normal too, but this is not the end yet

The art of death. I believe that death can beautiful, maybe not exactly art but it can come close. I have always been a fan of gore, and I am really fond of the idea of creating my own. I love gruesomeness, I love watching the perfectly crafted human (or any animal really) body come to pieces. All its progress over the course of time come to pieces in a bloody mess. Maybe it's some sort of fetish, so I will assume this is a normal reaction too.

That is most of it really very quickly summarized, like I said I'm sure most of these thoughts are normal in the human species, however some just choose to hide it, disgusted by themselves for desiring such a thing, others will in fact brag about it in an attempt to be edgy and get attention. Others will just have them in a minor scale and brush them off or not even be aware of them. I however, have come to accept and embrace them. I don't feel disgust, or horror for it. I'm fact, I am fascinated by it. Remnants of our savagery, proof we are not as refined as we think we are.

So, so far this entire post has been completely pointless and has brought nothing new to the table, so what is it doing here then? Am I ironically just being edgy and looking for attention like I said earlier? No, I just want to know more about this subject in general. I want to know more explanations about this, more causes, like I said I am fascinated by this, and I desire to know more about it. Another thing is the people that choose to control it and how exactly they do it.

Just to clarify I have never killed anyone or anything, so don't call the police just yet. But yeah, that's about it, I want to know your thoughts and ways to control your own impulses, other than the obvious not wanting to be arrested one.",22Sep2017,2

30,"Yo. Well this is embarrassing, and a long read (sorry!) but:

I play a lot of video games. Ever so often, a game will get frustrating (usually in a online multiplayer game)...then MORE frustrating, stacked on top more frustration, then I go into a stupid rage where I am bashing myself in the head. Like, hard. WHY. Anger just gets to a point where I can't control myself I guess. Sadly, this has been going on for a long time (15 years maybe), only, I used to bash things like my computer desk, or punch a hole in the wall (oof...embarrassing). I think I started bashing myself in the head because it doesn't make a huge loud noise like bashing my desk/wall used to...so I can rage in quiet while no one else in the house is the wiser. They might pick up on it once in a while and be like ""did you hear some noises?"" and I'm all, ""nope!"". Then the rest of the night I'm super depressed, like, ""I can't believe I did that, again...got SO worked up over something that doesn't matter at all, again.

ugh. I already have enough problems in my life without these anger spurts that happen once a month or so. And my Brain has probably taken some lasting damage- well, maybe not, I don't know. Repeated forceful impacts to the head are not a good thing, that's for sure.

and I'm not in a bad mood going into the game, I just want to have some fun. Like yesterday, had a great day, got plenty of exercise and had fun. Day is happy and fine. Then I have some free leisure time so I fire up a video game...and circumstances are so that it's just one failure after another, and it mounts into a rage quickly. I don't take it out an anyone else, or project my anger on anyone but just myself...which is something positive, I guess. It just happens so fast, one minute I'll be fine and the next I'm smashing my head. Also seems like I'm hardly breathing at all (been trying to focus on my breathing, too often my heart is racing while playing the game).

Easy answer is to stop playing the game! Not a bad option, but I have given up games in the past, and always end up on something else. I think the problem is way more ME than any video game, and it's me that I'm trying to fix. I have plenty of gaming sessions where I can play the game and be fine, even if losing and I play and be happy and enjoy the game, but every once in a while, I get that horrible quick-onset rage.

Sometimes other players are hideously mean, too, of course, but when that happens it usually that just makes me really depressed, not angry. The anger is all my doing.

So I do all the usual positive mental health stuff, sleeping well, exercising every single day, eating smart, and that all helps for sure, but I still have my problems. I certainly hope it wont be like this for the rest of my life. I guess I'm looking for advice on how to overcome my issues.",22Sep2017,1

33,"This is getting ridiculous now... I have made a post about this before, but I would like to bring it back up again, as no improvements have been made.

Basically, since I started playing CSGO again, at the start of this year, I told myself I wanted to get really good and as I already have 2k hours, I wanted to get back into it and get really good.

I have never had any problems before or ever, but ever since I started playing again, I became really paranoid about a lot of things. For example it started off with how much of my arm was on the desk, then how do I sit, as I have been getting upper back pain, which still kinda exists to this day, but I am trying to work on it.

But my main problem and concern is that ever since I got back into CSGO, I did buy a new mouse, the EC2-A, whereas I used to use the FK2. I began to really try and grip the mouse ""right"" by pushing the mouse right to the back of my hand and kinda squeezing it inbetween my hand to get a grip of it. This really did not work, I was not precise and it was very uncomfortable, but its just what I was doing for some reason. I switched between the 2 mouse for quite a while, until I decided it was the mice that were the problem and ended up buying a shit tonne of mice -_-. Only to send them all back and to find myself is the problem.

To be honest, I have looked at pro mouse grips, tried all different mouse grips, tried different mice. Nothing works, I messed up my muscle memory so bad, so I do not have any muscle memory at all, its just all gamesense when I am playing, and little muscle memory. All of them thousands of hours of FPS games I have played on PC, all that skill built up, gone.

It sounds really dumb and some of you probably may laugh, I tried googling it, pretty much no one else has this problem, except me. And its not a just keep playing thing, as every mouse grip either feels uncomfortable, or it feels painful, so I just really don't know what to do.

I embharess myself when I am playing whereas I used to be really confident. And this is not just when I am playing CSGO, its when I am playing every single game, even just browsing the internet or on the computers at college.

I am wanting to do a job with computers in the future, but currently, whenever I am on a computer, all I can think of is how I grip the mouse and I just can't find a firm mouse grip, that is comfortable and works. And its really off putting, as I have put thousands of hours into CSGO and other games, and then boom this just happens.

It probably gradually happened over time, but I really don't know what causes it as I never had these problems ever before, but since I got back into CSGO, a lot of problems sprung up, and now its really ridiculous and stupid.

If anyone has any advice or has had this same problem before, please let me know what I can do to fix it, as I don't think its just a try a different mouse or keep playing sort of problem, as I have hammered it into my brain, and now its kinda messed up.

Thanks for reading and sorry if this was so long, but I really had to get my story out there. As stupid as it sounds, its true, and you don't realise how frustrating and bad it is, until its you. And its mad that such a simple thing as holding something can cause so many problems. The other problems I listed earlier, I can sort out more myself, if not I could see a doctor. But is this a mental problem, because I don't think saying I can't hold a mouse is good enough to go to the doctors for :/

Seeing all these new people improving and doing good, just makes me want to get better, I have the mentality, I know I can get better, but my mouse grip is my big barrier, just stopping me.

But seriously thanks for reading, I really hope you guys can help me somehow or give some advice, as I think I will need to do something long term to sort this out, as it defiantly wont be a quick fix.

Pictures of current mouse grip: (I kinda hold the mouse at a funny angle for some reason too, idk...)

41,"I'm beginning to think my ex has BPD. She's had a horrible life - her parents are horrible - she was outed to them by a psychiatrist at 14 after having suicidal thoughts, and they abandoned her to live with her half sister while they went back to their home country. She has been abused multiple times. Ostracized by her family, etc etc... I won't write out all the horrible things that have happened but no one deserves the life she's had.  

Anyway, i was with her for 4 years and during this time she was completely unstable. She must have broken up with me at least 4 times. She always had something she was mad at me about - she always perceived that i was hurting her and then she would try to hurt me back (even though i had absolutely no idea i had done anything to begin with).  She would say horrible things to me that cut right down to my deepest insecurities, to purposefully hurt me. I felt like I was always walking on eggshells around her - never knowing what would set her off.  At the same time she completely idolized me - thought the best things about me - like rally extreme swings back and forth.  She never let me have alone time - I think I eventually became a shell of my former self.  

Now that i have some distance from her for almost a year I'm left wondering if being with her for so long has affected my mental health.

Back to the question. For example, if I say you are insufferable. They say ""I'll show you how insufferable I am""

&amp;nbsp;

Or if I say you just give the same generic response to everything. They ""I'm going to be real generic, you just watch"".

I feel like the person that is doing this to me does this whenever I use a word they don't know and they are angry at me. Perhaps they are coping with their insecurity about not having the knowledge to be able to understand what I'm saying by just using it in sentences that aren't really coherent at all to fill their insecurity and appear less stupid.

My depression peaked my freshman year of college, and reached a point to where I was contemplating suicide, cutting, had zero self-worth, and failing classes. My depression was induced due to lack of self-esteem and my friend group at the time was extremely toxic. I made friendship changes and things slowly got better. I started counselling and continued to get better. I was put on Celexa 40 mg and have been taking that for ~3 years now. My entire mindset, aside from anxiety problems, has since shifted for the better and I have been slowly coming off of celexa since. I started reducing my doses in 10 mg intervals over the course of 4 months, and now I'm happy to say that I haven't had it in 5 days. With me being off of celexa, please don't say that I should go back on it. I'm not depressed, and haven't been in 2 years. It doesn't help with my anxiety at all and I'm done with the side effects. In addition to anxiety and depression, I'm also dealing with an undiagnosed eating disorder and have since I was in 6th grade. Ever since then I've been thinking about food 24/7 and restricting, counting calories, looking up diets, over exercising, or binging. It has always been something, but it really got worse when I was depressed my freshman year of college. In less than 6 months, I binged so much, that I gained 40 pounds. That led to me overly restricting calories and over exercising, I lost all the weight and then some over 5 months. My therapist still doesn't have a clue about my ED. 

This brings me to the present. I have a B.A. in Biology and I'm currently attending pharmacy school. I'm a first year professional student and up until Wednesday, things were relatively okay. I passed all my first exams and managed my stress well. I've been in a relationship for ~2 years, ever since I fully got through my depression. It's been my first real relationship. Everything in the past  with potential significant others has been a shit show. Always starting with me liking someone, talking to them, and then feeling like shit because I never felt good enough. It wasn't even just feeling good enough, it was feeling like I was nothing. During these times, my ED would also get triggered. It was really hard, and I just didn't understand my feelings. With counselling, I've been able to break down my thoughts and feelings and constructively analyze them so I could improve my depression-invoking negative self thoughts to be more positive. This alone has improved my life tremendously. It's allowed me to have a healthy romantic relationship. That's why after I met my current boyfriend, I didn't feel bad. I didn't hate myself or dwell on attributes that I didn't like myself. I just didn't address them or act like the existed. My ED wasn't triggered. I channeled the energy that I would've spent on that on making him as happy as he made me, and honestly when I think back to that time it was like we were having a ""who can make the other person happier"" competition. It was normal.

I have since studied abroad since we got together and we have lived together for just over a year now. A few short months after us living together, major changes started to happen in our relationship. Going on dates stopped, giving each other small gifts stopped, he didn't try to celebrate any of my accomplisments (graduation, white coat ceremony, and getting into one of the top pharmacy schools) compliments stopped, there were times we would have sex less than 1/week when it was ~3 times/week before (I had to try to initiate it, I never stopped but he just started to turn me down constantly), he expected me to continue to pay for all my things when we ate out even though I couldn't afford it and he knew that (before we lived together, I rarely ate out). The lack of affection and interactions with me really hurt, espeically when I continued on my side. All I wanted were things to go back to normal. I knew something was off, so I encouraged him to go to a therpist himself.  He went through some major life changes, i.e. graduating from college, landing his first major job, dietary, social, and lifestyle changes. It just appeared to me that he was forcing himself to do so much, and I was worried. He didn't make any friends in college, and never really went out, thus he doesn't really have anyone but me and some online friends he games with. I have since found out that his therapist doesn't think he's emotionally ready for a relationship. She's more so encouraging us to break up because it will be harder for him to try and improve himself while in a relationship. In the meantime, I've been frustrated because even though I expressed concerns about him needing to be more considerate, he still hasn't been. This has been going on for a year now and he's been in counselling for 9 months without major improvement and he hasn't been actively trying to get better since counselling. He's told me numerous times that he just doesn't think it's going to be worth it so he just shouldn't try.

 I just feel like a roommate to him, and it hurts. I guess more than I realized and I think I know why now, which I'll get to in a second.  We've been argueing a lot, and I've been angry more times than I should. Every argument starts the same- me being upset or ""too sensitive"", me trying to talk through it leading with anger but eventually trying to be more constructive, and then him feeling like shit because he can't do anything right. We argue at least twice a month, sometimes more frequently, but I've been working on that. 

Well, I didn't realize how much I've internalized all these arguements  and the lack of affection. I knew I had self-esteem problems but they've never been a problem because I never had to address it. I had friends, a boyfriend, and I was doing well academically so why would I consider it and let it be a problem by dwelling on it. I knew that my self-esteem was related to depression in the past, so I didn't want to repeat it. 

Since pharmacy school has started, I have met a lot of people. One of those being a guy that I think it one of the best people I've ever met. I'm going to call him Chad. We have since become pretty close. We are both in less than optimal relationships, his being a lot worse and actually abusive. We've been leaning on each other a lot for emotional support, and I can sense myself developing feelings. I've never overstepped my boundaries and I've tried to get him to meet other girls. I'm just trying to develop our friendship to the point where I can't think of him being more than just a friend. It has been working up until Wednesday, and honestly I still feel odd by the thought of us dating. Before anyone says stop being friends. I literally need him in my life. I have no one else. literally. My two best friends moved away, and I haven't had a solid friendship for over a year, hence why I want us to be good friends. I have noticed now that he makes the pain I'm experiencing, less. I don't know what I'd do without him. 

Now to the point that catalyzed all of this. My boyfriend and I got into another fight Wednesday. He was trying to break up with me, and me being me, had to fix everything and make it better. This led again to me getting angry at him for not being considerate and not trying to improve and trying to constructively fix things after. That day we setted on integral things we need to improve about ourselves. He needs to take at least 30 minutes a day to work on himself, and he agreed to that and I need to work on my patience and anger. Well, that night I planned to go out with Chad and a good portion of our pharmacy class to pre-game and go to the bars after. Considering, I don't know very many people I hung out mostly with Chad. I was probably the least drunk one in the group and decided to chug a pitcher of beer because I was sick of kinda feeling awkward. I guess this is the part I should mention that I hold myself to extremely high standards. I've always come off as cold and unaffectionate. I've only become more affectionate since counselling and the only person I'm affectionate towards is my boyfriend, and it's probably more affection than a gf usually gives their bf. So, by the time I was chugging the pitcher I was probably as relaxed as a normal person is sober (losely using the term normal. I'm just crazy high-strung). Well, I drank the entire thing in less than &lt;20 minutes and after that everything went down hill. I was all over Chad. Thinking about telling him how I felt (not that it would go anywhere, but I chose differently because I want to be friends more than anything) and giving him more affection than I should, like resting my arm on his lower back or leaning my head against his shoulder. We switched bars, and had to hold eachother up while walking to the other location. Honestly, I have little doubt that it looked like we were friends. Chad during this time started freaking out about my boyfriend and how he would feel, during this time I grabbed his face and I told him not to worry about it. If my boyfriend would care, I would handle it. Then he just kept saying how much of a great guy my boyfriend is and how nice he was to him (they met earlier in the day) and that he felt bad. I think this was mostly due to the fact that I mentioned to Chad that my boyfriend could potentially be jealous weeks prior, which my boyfriend swears he isn't because he trusts me. Anyhow, while we were at the other bar, I told Chad to talk to his crush (which he is crushing on without actually knowing her at all, which considering his relationship past I'm concerned about). Chad is breaking up with his girlfriend soon, and I'm so happy for him. During this time, I had a hard time dealing with my emotions. I'm assuming it's because of my potential feelings for Chad, the status of my relationship, my lack of friends, and zero self-esteem because following me leaving Chad to talk to this girl he bailed on me and went to the bar we were previously at. I regrouped with him a few minutes later, but while I was by myself I wrote a message to myself about how I was nothing and that no one liked me or cared. So you know, I could remind myself when I'm sober? I swear I'm a fucking idiot. As soon as I met back up with Chad, I asked my boyfriend to get me and he did. I kissed chad on the cheek (wtf? why? I wouldn't ever normally do that) said bye and left. My boyfriend has since told me that when I got into the car he knew something was wrong and he had to get me to admit that it bothered me that Chad dragged me around to look for a girl. Apparently that's all I could focus on. As soon as we got home, I collapsed on the ground and started to cry. Like sobb, for 3 hours straight. I was inconsolable. All I could think about was how bad and guilty I felt. For having feelings for Chad and holding his face and kissing him on the cheek (he actually saw me kiss Chad on the cheek and didn't think anything of it, but I still feel so bad). I sobbed that he can't blame me for trying to get another man's affections (I admited to liking Chad), that I just wanted to get drunk enough to cheat on him but I can't because my morals are too high, then I just started saying that no one cared about me and that he, my boyfriend, didn't either. How much I hated myself for making him feel bad during our arguements and how I blamed myself for not being good enough for anyone. How I blammed myself for everything bad in our relationship and how much I wanted to kill myself. I just kept saying all of that repeatedly. My boyfriend then took care of me and made sure I was okay. The last two days, my feelings have remained the same. I still feel guilty, worse now because I didn't realize that I said those things about trying to get drunk enough to cheat on my boyfriend. The thing is, is that I wasn't, and my boyfriend knows I wasn't because I didn't plan on consuming a lot of alcohol. I also haven't sought out his affection or any man's affection. I've always set boundaries between Chad and I that my boyfriend knows about, I rarely text or talk to him first, etc. I never let that be an intention. I always talked to Chad about trying to make my relationship work, not the opposite. I've even told him these things when I'm drunk. Everything I say about my boyfriend is never negative, it's just about situations that happen. The fact that I said those things makes me so mad and feel worse, because it hurt him worse and it wasn't even true. I think I just said it because when other people show me affection, compliment me, etc. It's a way of me validating my self-worth. Because I've experienced little to no affection and support in the last year, I think I just internalized it instead of addressing my actual emotions. It manifested in anger towards my boyfriend for not giving me any, but he didn't understand why it was such a huge deal to me. Which with me yelling at him about it, probably only made him want to distance himself more. 

This finally leads me to the actual point of the post. I definitely have a problem with self esteem. It's nothing new, but I thought I was past this. Yeah, I knew I sucked, but I was at least somewhat accepting of myself so it was whatever. By not worrying about it, it's  manifested into a lot of guilt. Since I was drunk, and said all of the things I did, I can't ignore it. I didn't even know it was there. I knew I needed friends, but I didn't realize how much I relied on them for validating my self-worth. Since then I realized I have unhealthy guilt. It's really bad, and I don't know how to get past this. It's all I can think about. I have to stop myself from crying 25+ times a day, and sometimes I still cry. I've just worked to hard to this to bring me back down. If I knew this was a problem I wouldn't have let it get to this point. All I can think about is how much a dislike myself, how much I suck, and how much I don't deserve anyone. I'm mostly suffering alone and my boyfriend knows, but I don't know if he realizes how bad it is. I don't want anyone to see me like this, but I can't just not go to my social and academic obligations. That would only make it worse. I think a good part of my guilt is that I feel like I'm inadequate. I'm not perfect, and it's bothering me. I don't need shit on ""no one's perfect"", I know that, but I have to be the best I can be and while I know that might not be perfection, I know that I can get close to it. I just don't know what to do, and I can't continue to deal with these intense feelings. ",22Sep2017,2

51,"Hi, all! I don't really know what's up with me or how to deal with it, but it's getting overwhelming. I've recently discovered that hormonal birth control really screws with me, and I've since had my Mirena removed (though I understand that it will take some time for me to get back to normal).

Basically, I feel guilty about everything. Using today as an example:

I went to lunch with a friend. My SO, whom I love very much and is always very supportive and caring, forgot that I went to lunch and came home to have lunch with me. Thankfully, I returned in time for us to still have a few minutes, but he mentioned that he wished he hadn't forgotten my lunch date because then he wouldn't have come home and instead would have gone to lunch with his boss (which is a big deal, since he's trying to push himself into prime position to take his boss's place and thus could use all the lunch dates he can get). Despite my SO in no way blaming me and saying it was his own fault he forgot that I went to lunch (I reminded him this morning), I felt crushing guilt. What if the person his boss went out with (one of his two main competitors for the position) gets the job because she went instead of him? I should have reminded him again. Or maybe it's my fault because he comes home to have lunch with me. Somehow it's my fault and I feel guilt, even though none of that makes sense.

So he goes back to work, and I'm a little deflated. I feel guilty for not smiling at him as he leaves (I always walk with him to the car). He sends me a message from work with a virtual hug saying that it's really okay, he could tell I was a bit off and that he definitely wasn't blaming me. I feel guilty that he feels bad for me. I feel guilty that he has to pay such attention to my constantly waffling state of mind. That's not his responsibility. It's a very sweet thing to do, but I feel guilty that he does it. I feel guilty, like I'm burdening him.

I bring up that not knowing if he's going to get this position is stressing me out admittedly more than I realized. We chat about it. I feel guilty for giving him a suggestion on how I would approach the situation, even though his way is likely right because he's worked in that field and I haven't so I don't know how it goes. I feel guilty that I may have made him feel like I think he's entitled, even though that's not what I meant. I feel guilty that I have to clarify and that my poor phrasing might have spoiled his good mood.

I feel guilty about taking time out of his busy work day to have this entire conversation.

He reminded me that I really don't have to be so worried about offending him all the time. I feel guilty that he so patiently repeats this and soothes me OVER and OVER again without getting mad. 

I'm SO SICK of feeling guilty about everything. In my mind, I can rationally realize that there's no reason to feel that way and that it makes no sense, but I still get bogged down by the physical feeling. I want it to go away, but I don't know what it is. Anxiety? Depression? 

Anybody have any idea?

EDIT: Forgot to mention that I at least have a hunch where this comes from: my dad, to whom I could never do anything right. I grew up getting yelled at and hiding in my room so he wouldn't yell or make fun of me, and then when I'd come out he'd yell about me hiding in my room. So I suspect I just assume others hold the worst opinion of me. Doesn't help me know how to get over it, though.",22Sep2017,1

However, I'm coming across a problem in that my spouse will soon lose his healthcare that gets therapists, psychiatrists, and necessary medication to stem off mental disorder.

I'm fortunate, the VA will continue to prescribe me my Anti-Depressants but he seems to be given a middle finger.

My question is, if I have to get private healthcare/government healthcare which is the best to use? Is there other relatively cheap sources we can pursue to ensure he stays on medication and gets the treatment he needs?

57,"""Senioritis"" is just a term describing the decline in effort, attendance, procrastination, etc of high school seniors who are tired of high school and choose to spend their senior year being lazy, taking easy classes and partying every weekend (in some cases). But anyway, a lot of seniors relate to this or go through this phase of ""YOLO"" basically and it's kind of something joked about. Just doing the bare minimum to get by. The thing is that I also have no motivation, energy, effort, attention, etc either. But it's bc I'm not loving this whole existence thing. Just not for me lol. 

People say ""I don't care"" about school bc they want to have fun and not stress, but I don't care about anything bc I literally don't give a shit about myself and seriously cannot force myself to try at all. I'm so absent minded ALL the time but I don't do anything about it bc I don't care. I don't care if I fail my senior year (I'm usually an A's student), I don't care if I'm clean (too depressed to shower), I don't care if I eat or drink and I lost my debit card earlier this week and I don't care. Like I haven't done anything about it. Ok end of rant sorry idk where I was even going w this but I don't give a fuck about anything in my life and I don't see any point of all this.

58,"Hi all! I'll be upfront, I'm plugging my own subreddit here. Please delete if inappropriate.

After years of struggling I recently had my first manic episode, followed in quick succession by a number of increasingly worse ones until I ended up hospitalised for my own safety.

This is not a bad thing. I know everyone's mind works differently, but for me, I have *just known* since, well, forever that I had some form of Bipolar Affective Disorder. It may have taken a fortnight of the worst possible scenario to get a proper diagnosis but now that I've got it, it's (touch wood) plain sailing from here. My whole life leading to this point has been one long lesson in coping mechanisms.

Which leads me to the point of this post. I work in the Arts, with a particular focus on comedy and comedy writing. If you'll indulge my ego for a moment, I like to think that all this combined makes me just like my idol - Robin Williams. What a wonderful man, but what a tragic end.

It also reminds me of an old joke, made famous by Watchmen:  

&gt; Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, ""Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up."" Man bursts into tears. Says, ""But doctor...I am Pagliacci.  
  
Which has led me to this: r/barefootcobblers

I want to build a community, similar to this one but for people across all areas of personality disorders, who are either comics, clowns, jesters and funnymen, or who just agree with the adage that 'laughter is the best medicine'.

The 'sad clown' is a fairly famous archetype, but I think naming it after Pagliacci might be a little too 'niche'. I instead chose to focus on the old saying 'The Cobblers Children go Barefoot'. I.e. Those with specific skills (making people laugh) are the one who benefit the least from them. 

This isn't necessarily an advertisement for the sub, rather it's me, fairly new to the 'online mental health community', looking for hints, tips and advice for what sort of things people are after when they're looking for these things; help, support, and a good laugh to get through it all with a smile. 

Ideally, id love to end up with a sub that is a mixture of this one, with it's hints, tips and cathartic confessions, combined with r/funny and a (much more careful) version of r/2meirl4meirl.
