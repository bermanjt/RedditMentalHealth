0,"Hiya! So I Day dream a lot when I'm listening to music and kind of have this alternative world in my head. It's all cool, doesn't effect my day to day life but sometimes if I'm in my own little world- say I'm in a house or something I'll start to think their is something scary in that house. Like, say I'm with friends and I want to go to another room but a scary like ""demon"" may be hiding in the room and then all I can concentrate is that- and it ruins the Day dream. I do this when I'm at work too. I work at a grocery store and it gets kinda slow so I have to stand in front of my register waiting for customers but then I think ""what if a clown started slowly running down the isle"" and I picture it and it's so weird. I sleep with my dog in my room and at night if she makes a little noise I have to turn on the light to make sure it's really her. Sometimes when I would be home alone I even locked my door, part of me was like ""come on, nothing's ever gonna happen"" but part of me is always anticipating seeing a ghost or something I shouldn't. I'm a very creative person, I've seen a lot of movies and I incorporate a lot of that into my imagination and I'm very open to all the peculiar things that could happen in the world yet seem obscure. 


My question Is, is there a world for the little scary things my mind creeps into my thoughts? Is or paranoia or something else?",07May2017,1

2,"I have this problem where I'm too conscious of my feelings, and where they come from. I had what might have been mild depression one or two years ago, and it largely feels like it has passed, but this particular problem still exists and might be related. Whenever I'm feeling a particular kind of positive emotion, if I notice it happening it goes away. For example, I might absent-mindedly look at a pleasant view and enjoy doing so. When I notice what I'm doing, and focus my attention more fully on what I'm looking at, the feeling disappears. It's similar when I have some kind of revelation that brings on an emotion - when I think, 'oh, I'm getting a feeling from this', it's like I'm suddenly focusing on that fact instead, making the original feeling go away. I also go weirdly focused on the precise details of where an emotion or pleasure comes from. Going back to the example of looking at a view, I think about whether the feeling is only there if I focus on a particular part of the view, or from a particular angle. It's incredibly frustrating and makes me feel like I'm going insane, as if I'm irrevocably divorced from reality in some way. It's like I can't actually have experiences in a normal way anymore. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this, and whether there's some kind of label that can be put on it. Looking online I've been unable to find almost any other cases like this, and its kind of terrifying feeling like I'm the only one in the world this is happening to.",07May2017,1
3,"I have paranoid schizophrenia. When I'm around my dad I'm bipolar. but I can control that. I'm having my partner help me write this post. They control themselves.

4,"Hey everyone, I have a good friend who is planning on taking medication for bipolar disorder for the first time next week. She's been reading a lot about how a lot of people feel like shit for the first couple days or so and I'd like to create a care plan for her so that she won't feel so scared to start out.

So, people who have taken bipolar medication--what helps? Is it nice to have people around or better if they just stop by with food &amp; entertainment then dip out? Did you like it when people were cheery and optimistic or would you rather them not be quite so extra? Let me know!!",07May2017,1
5,"My thoughts more often than not go so fast that I legitimately cannot discern them one from the other, and my emotions recently are some horrific misery where my thoughts, though they go fast, manage to focus on just one thing: the end of the world.

I feel as if I know much about what will happen. And it doesn't end well for anyone.

An unintentional coping mechanism I have developed to deal with this is spinning such horrific violence and chaos into something good.  ""It's progress"", I reason, ""it's evolution.  The liars and cheaters will die.  All will be forced to face reality, and we will learn who is man and who is mouse.  We will all be taught that we are not so invincible as we seem to think we are.""  And so on and so forth.  This little mechanism works so effectively that I have begun to look forward to it.  Whenever I become stressed (which is often, sudden, and for little to no reason) I simply imagine fire out my windows and gunfire, and all becomes well.

This is *constant*.  What little thoughts I can discern from the mess are questions about the nature of consciousness and being and God and death and infinity and other philosophical things.

Deep down inside, I have accepted that I am going mad.  Because it most certainly feels like it.",07May2017,1
6,"Dear depression,

You're an asshole. But you will never realize that. You just looooove to get in my personal space and tell me everything that's wrong with me. Yeah, yeah, I get it, I'm a self pitying bitch, I binge eat to feel better, and I drink to take the pain away. But even when I'm doing well, you'll find something wrong with me and point it out. You neurotic perfectionist you. 

I've tried to break up with you but you say we're still together. I've even cheated on you with love, enthusiasm and happiness but you let them know I was yours and yours only so they backed off. You always say ""quit blaming your past, this is all your fault, everything is your fault"". Yeah, it's true, but why must you remind me of this every hour of everyday. 

Every morning I wake up and try to get my day going but you pull me in with your smooth ways...""come on love, let's just hangout, you and me, we can watch movies all day, eat, maybe try some new drugs, it'll be a grand time"" but in the end, it's all for you. But guess what? One day, you'll be gone. It could be today, it could be tomorrow. It could be a year, or maybe even the day I die. 

This is a toxic and abusive relationship we have. I have to let you go my dear. I HAVE to let you go eventually. I've met somebody else....myself. I know you're going to try to stick around but you're going to have to give up. I'm getting stronger each day and realizing how unhealthy you are for my mental health. Good bye for now, depression....

You're truly.",07May2017,3

My jokes aren’t funny because I’m saying them. My personality isn’t desirable because its me. People see the worst in me when they first meet me. I see the worst in people because I see the worst in myself. My outlook on life is that the entire world is against me. People I don’t know don’t like me without even saying a word. People who love me are faking it because its impossible for someone to love me when I don’t love myself.
People don’t want to meet me. I have nothing interesting to say. 
But rather than work on it just want to Cawl up in a ball and do noting. i don’t fight for what I want, I let people tell me what to do rather than think for my self. I try and shut down my brain whenever I can because I know Im wrong  all the time, even when I’m right. I don’t work hard. I procrastinate because Id rather indulge in little pleasures than focus on my goals because I feel like I would never achieve them anyways.

12,"I've posted here before explaining issues that were only mild. Lots of people told me to get help, and I promised I'd tell someone about it, but here I am, two months later, and I'm losing it. Everything is getting worse, I'm isolating myself from all of my friends (the few I have left). It's like trying to climb a tree but the branches keep breaking under you when you try to go up. For about a half a year, I've suspected there was something wrong with me. Desperate to know what it was, I turned to (groan) self diagnosing myself. Through those crappy quizzes, all the information, led me to anxiety and mild depression. 
I thought now that I knew, everything was fine.
It wasn't fine. 
Or at lease it was fine for a while. It went from nervousness in some situations to panic attacks in months. 
I told my parents about it two weeks ago because I had a major presentation coming up in one of my classes, and all they said was ""oh you're fine"". 
I need the strength to tell someone. I have a check up coming up soon, should I bring it up then?

14,"8 years ago my toddler son died in a household accident. I was wrongfully charged with child abuse resulting in death. It took a year for the charges to be dropped, I lost my job as a defense contractor because my clearance was suspended during the investigation. My clearance also expired since I was due for a reinvestigation at the time. 

I was 30 years old with ten years of my life invested in my career as a signals intelligence analyst. Virtually nothing from that career translates to the civilian world. 

My wife, 4 kids, and myself moved back to Illinois to be with family and grieve our loss. I went back to school but was hit with major depression. I have since been in and out of the hospital, no treatment seems to work. I am effectively disabled by depression. 

I am better than I used to be, at one point I was catatonic for a period of 30 days. Then incapable of getting out of bed. Then I underwent electroconvulsive therapy and got some normalcy back in my life.

Now, I just take care of the kids and the house while my wife works. The days go by like minutes and blur together. I feel like I'm living at the Hotel California and I can never leave. 

I'm not originally from this part of Illinois, my wife is and I hate it. It's everything I joined the military to get away from. A dead end small town with small minds. 

I've pleaded with my wife to move, but she won't. My kids are my only reason for living and I have no friends here.

16,"I get jealous of someone I'm not with and over the stupidest, littlest things that make no sense logically. Like I'll fixate in a person but still look for others because idk. I want love but Its almost like I can't decide, or don't want to. I don't know what to do but I feel a hole and I want to fill it with anyone and everyone and I can't and it doesn't help. 

The more I want someone the less I'm able because I freak out and worry and get jealous because I dont know why. But I do. And it always feels terrible. And I can never tell anyone because if I do I look crazy and stupid because I'm overreacting. I get that. Logically I get that. But it's like I don't believe it, or canto or just won't because it doesn't matter what makes logical sense, I'm not worth it to this person. There has to be someone else or something bad going on, I can't trust anyone and the more I like someone the more anxious and worried I get. Paranoid. 

I have a hard time being around them and functioning. I'm stressed. I can't be friendly with them, normal conversation doesn't flow. I'm so highstrung that I feel like I'm acting unnaturally, like I don't know the person. In the rare times I'm not consumed by worry, paranoia, or jealousy, it feels great. But even that's terrible...i feel  so attached that I just want to do everything with them. I want to do intimate things for intimacies sake, not just for lust. If I wanted that I could but I'm too afraid to do that even. I don't know what to do. I just want to be happy. And I wish I felt like I don't need someone else but I feel like I do. I feel so alone but then I end up being the problem. I cause the issues. I mean things up. I get so used to it that I preemptively end relationships (romantic or not). I'll call out that I know how this is going to end. Because it ""always ends like this."" 

I'm a mess and I'm not good enough for anyone and I hate myself. I hate how this feels, I just want to be loved and cared for and feel important to someone and to feel the same for them. I want it to be natural and not so attached as I feel I don't know.

Sexual side-effects are also common with SSRIs, such as loss of sexual drive, failure to reach orgasm, and erectile dysfunction. Although usually reversible, these sexual side-effects can, in some cases, last for months or years after the drug has been completely withdrawn. 

I was lied to! I was told it wasn't possible there could be lingering side effects. 

In a study of 1022 outpatients, overall sexual dysfunction with all antidepressants averaged 59.1%. 

I was again lied to. I was told side effects are extremely rare.

28,"I'm 21 years old and i don't think i'm an emotionaly stable adult. 
So a quick background info about me: I have always been an introvert and have suffered from moderate-high social anxiety all my life. I don't know where it stemmed from , but i think it's because of two reasons: The frist being that I was bullid in primary school. When i was in kinder garden i guess, my teacher shouted ""Go wash your hand and take your finger out from you nose!"" And the entire class laughed, and ever since then i was the kid all the other kids made fun off, refused to touch and be friends with. It stuck until middle school, when eventually we grew up a little and i was friends with the entire class. I didn't talk to anyone about this ever and would cry in school/home frequently when no one was looking. I think since then i have always censored myself A LOT for the fear of being judged and made fun of. I've never been comfortable with people. But i have tried to overcome it every single day of my life, trying to speak up, trying to be normal and happy and carefree like others. I never gave up. I can't recall a single day when life was chill and i wans't anxious and dissapointed in myself. But i always went to bed thinking i will do better tomorrow and not give up. And it has paid up to a certain extent. I                  improved a little in high school and after moving away for college the first year was horryfying and depressing, though i think that's were most of my growth came from. I am not fairly comfortable in social situations and confident about mydelf(Well, compartively).
Also, the other reason i might have social anxiety is my Mother. I love my mother, but she has always had low confidence and competence compared to the rest of the world and also suffers from a high degree of social anxiety. Both my siblings and me have social anxiety. The bullying case was unique for me , but looking at my siblings i think my mother ia also a factor.

So, coming back to the present, there is a long list of things that are wrong with me . Here Goes: 1) I need a LOT of alone time and though i enjoy being with friends/family,but i always need to go somewhere alone and think (well, overthink.)
2) I have never been in a relationship because whenever someone shows interest i convince myself he is lying and trying to play me and i don't wan't to be one of those foolish girls who fell for a lie. I have sabotaged too many promising relationships i swear.
3)Focus. I cant focus when even the tiniest thing goes wrong or is unexpected. I am doing very well academically and am a hardworking and motivated individual. But it comes at a price. I cut myself off entirely from the workd when i need to focus. I HAVE TO. Someitmes for MONTHS. When i try to maintain a healthy balance, even the stupidest thing by the stupidest person leads to a lot of exitement/Overthinking on my part for no good reason and i just can't focus. So the only options left is to cut myself odd so that my work is not affected. If my morning routine does not go as planned, my entire day goes to a waste.
4)I constantly think about the cringeworthy things i did in the past. Every beautiful memory is ruined by something i did/said which i am sure was deeply humiliating. All the memories and experiences that make me the person i am are ruines because i try my best to not think about them. 
5) I can't forgive people. If i get the tiniest of hints that a pperson does not respect me or is doing wrong and taking me for granted/i don't mean shit to them, i cut them out entirely from my life. No amount of begging/explaining helps. I just can't be with them anymore. As every person screws up once in a while including me, screw up's do happen and i leave those people behind. That leaves the longest list of people who are confused/oblivious and hurt because of me.

umm so that's all i can think of now. OH,Also, i think the reason i work so hard is because i dread becoming like my mother -incompetent and unsmart. Don't get me wrong, she is also the kindest and most innocent person i have ever seen. 

So i think what i'm trying to say is, i'm continuously anxious, paranoid and confused. Also, exhausted because of my issues.

43,"My mother started taking in stray cats about 25 yrs ago soon after my brother and I graduated high school and moved away.  Mom was filling a void I believe, to buffer the empty nest.  She always took good care of us when we were living at home and she sure has spoiled her cats over the years although she fussed at them a lot.  It reminded me of how she fussed about my dad all the time (but never to his face).

Now that mom is older, at 70 yrs, she still loves on her cats,  feeds them and waters them but the healthcare is virtually non existant.  That leads me to what inspired this post.

One cat named ""Salem"" began show signs of a worm infestation.  I assumed she was taking care of it but the next visit I noticed the cat looked worse.  I offered to buy the worm medicine.  She declined the offer saying ""I will pick it up, you don't need to do that.""  Before the next visit we talk on the phone and I asked her if she got the medicine to which she replied ""they were out of the right medicine.""  So next visit or the cat was so bad off it was hard to even look at him. I found medicine that she had had this whole time underneath the sink and one of her bathrooms I put it on the counter where she could see it and before we left I told her where it was. Before the next visit the cat had gotten really bad and passed away the day we came for another visit.

47,"ever since i developed ocd ive lost my life. I've been literally trapped in my own mind if that makes sense. i never had hand washing ocd, for me it was pure-o and intrusive thoughts. it wasn't that bad at first, just having random memories flash by but eventually it got to the point to where I couldn't focus on what I was doing because I was always thinking about other things. then I started to not be able to sleep cause the thoughts increased. then I couldn't work and started calling in all the time. got fired from jobs because I was so preoccupied with the thoughts. I started isolating myself. I would just sit in my room all day and do nothingy. there was one point in my life where I didn't talk to my roommate for a year and a half. I couldn't be around people because the thoughts were just so distracting. then the thoughts started getting really fucked up and ive been so scared to talk about it but i need to let it out

the intrusive thoughts got more and more intense and my mind was racing constantly 24 hours a day. then it began to turn into this unquenchable obsession with religion and philosophy. I would literally read about it for hours a day. just lie in my bed and read Wikipedia article after Wikipedia article I couldn't stop. read reddit politics thread after reddit politics thread. it was like I was being controlled. and then something happened that changed me forever

I was at my parents house and I got this image of having sex with baby brother..I started crying and threw up. then I couldn't get it out of my fucking head. I wasn't sure if I was a pedophile, like if I was a rapist or wanted to have incest or something. like I'm not a fucking pedophile IVE NEVER WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH MY BABY BROTHER LIKE WHAT THE FUCK and ever since that day I've never been the same. it fucking sucks because your own mind thinks of it so it's hard to distinguish between if it's the OCD or if it's really you. after that day that image was burned in my mind. I couldn't stop thinking about it. every day I thought back to having that thought. I started having panic attacks daily, probably about 10 a day. I couldn't believe myself I was so disgusted. I started to hurt myself because I was so angry that I could actually have thoughts like that. I didn't cut myself or anything but I started punching walls until my hands would bleed. like i wanted to punish myself. but then it got worse and when I would walk by random people the thoughts would come back again

then id walk by fucking children and my mind would make me think of it. so I started avoiding places even more. I wouldn't go out or do anything unless it involved something I had to do like going to work. straight up it was torture. for almost a year I couldn't sleep because I wasn't sure if I was a pedophile or not. most of that year I was just crying in my bed wishing I was dead. but the thoughts wouldn't fucking stop

I tried medication but they just made it worse. so I decided if all my life is gonna be these thoughts I'd rather be dead so that was when I tried to kill my self but it didn't work so I took that as I guess I'm supposed to be alive. i began to start meditating and slowly I began to kind of take the stress off myself, like sure i may have these thoughts but it's not me, it's the OCD

I've never really been able to fix it. every day I still wake up with these thoughts being the first thing in my mind and being reminded about them constantly throughout the day but I just try to ignore them. to be honest I would rather be dead at this point but thinking about killing myself again is mentally exhausting. it just sucks because i can never go back to a normal life now. I cry every day. I mean every damn day I have to remind myself it's not me but there's always this lingering voice in the back of my head that tells me that i really enjoy it...that's the worst part

I can never convince myself. once you've had those thoughts it's like there's no going back. most of my day is spent waking up, reliving the memories of these thoughts, having a panic attack realizing I thought these thoughts, convincing myself that it's not me it's the OCD, go to sleep, repeat. the scariest thing for me is its like ive lost my innocence. before this illness i struggled with mental illness, but you know i could still have a life. but now the thoughts just torment me constantly, and i will have to live my life forever knowing that these thoughts happened. im sorry for the long winded thread but i just had to vent. thanks for reading, and my condolences to everyone else struggling with mental illness

You can include the amount of detail you feel comfortable with. Thank you so much in advance.",07May2017,1
49,"This will be long winded. But, I'm about at my wits end.  Also, this is a throwaway log in if that matters.

I've been married to my wife for almost 18 years.  When we first got together I knew that she had a history of mental illness.  Here symptoms are that she tries to identify with marginalized groups For example:

1. She has extremely mild, unnoticeable cerebral palsy. She self identified as being disabled and associated with severely handicapped people.  This was before we met.  But, I get the impression from here mother that she was not really accepted by those folks.

2. She then self identified as an immigrant.  While technically true, as she was born a US citizen in Canada (Dad is US citizen / mom is Canadian).  In this case she didn't quite fit in / get full acceptance from the conventional immigrant community.

3. Then, she decided to embrace her Hispanic ethnicity (One of her parents is adopted and was assumed to be Hispanic).  This came to an end when a DNA test showed no such connection.

4. She is now taking up LGBTQ / Trans issues. She has told her family she is ""queer"".  But, seems more interested in saving that community than participating.  As a side note, her mother and I think she has chosen this group because she her membership cannot be disproved).

Other history includes her being sexually abused by a non-parent relative as a child.  And, being in an abusive sexual relationship with a former teacher.

 - She has difficulty with employers.   She has had the perception at most of her jobs that her boss was after her in some way.  She is in her late 30's and has only had one job last more than 4 years.

- Over the past few years, her immediate family has told me that she has flip flopped from telling them she wants to divorce me to telling them how great I am.

- She has seen a few therapists over the years. She seems to go until they say something she doesn't like,and then stops going.  One Psychiatrist told her she likely had BPD.  She never went back.

- She has been on anti-depressants for over 20 years that were prescribed by her GP.  Her meds have not been re-evaluated in all that time.

- This past summer she stopped taking the pill as she felt it was affecting her mood. For about a month it was like she was a new person.  She was happy, the sex was great, it looked like life had changed for the better.  Then, she pretty much walked away from her career level job for a temp position that paid about half as much.  She started shutting down. She then said she wanted a divorce early last fall. It didn't seem like she was 100% certain about this.  It's now may and the topic has only come up once more.

At this point her life involves sleeping, going to work, and getting lost in Facebook. She does the barest minimum around the house and seems more interested in escaping the house.  

Her family has assured me that this is not all my imagination and that they are also concerned.  I'm just not sure what to do at this point.",07May2017,1
50,"So I wasn't sure whether to put this in r/relationships or here, but ended up deciding it was ultimately a problem of mental health. 

I feel like I'm being victimized by my mind. I'm struggling to come to terms with my girlfriend's sexual ""past""—she's far more experienced than myself. ""Struggling"" is an understatement. I think it's ruining my life. 

If five minutes go by that I don't think about it, it's a blessing. It's the first thing I think about when I wake up. I especially cannot put it out of mind when I'm with her, which is horrible. She's literally perfect, and I feel terrible that her past (which I concede from an intellectual standpoint doesn't really matter) is interfering with my ability to love her, or to treat her how she deserves to be. 

But I'm more concerned about myself. I feel paralyzed. We were friends before we started dating, and so she told me basically her entire past. It didn't bother me then, of course, but it does now. I can't forget what she's told me, and it drives me crazy to go to parts of town where I know she's been with other men in promiscuous circumstances. I can hardly stand it. Entire neighborhoods are now out of the question. 

Worse than that are the ""images"" that float through my mind. It's like I have to see those scenes she told me about over and over again. Never has my mind been such a source of torture to me. 

I really am not the kind of person to bitch about mental problems on the internet. Otherwise I'm put together—social life, good grades in college, generally on the right track. I've struggled with depression before, but this is something else. It's worse. 

I wouldn't be posting here if I weren't desperate for help. What should I do? See a therapist? Meditate? Is there something wrong with me? 

If anyone could even tell me that they've experienced something similar—or to point me in the direction of a tentative psychological ""diagnosis""—it would be greatly appreciated. Miscellaneous advice would be appreciated as well. 

I'll be glad to fill in any missing blanks upon request. 

Thanks in advance.  ",07May2017,0
51,"I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years, her and I used to be pretty intimate a lot. Except within the past 6 months or maybe a year I began to hate being touched and the sexual intimacy isn't there, I have no desire to want it. It honestly has nothing to do with her, our lives are pretty great at the moment except my no touching issue.

Need help, I just want to know what's wrong and how to fix it or live with it",07May2017,1

54,"Hey guys, this is my first reddit post so im very sorry if i posted this in the wrong section or community or however this works. Okay so i was thinking about how the dopamine theory is heavily supported for the cause of schizophrenia, and maintenance of its symptoms, but is still not completely understood. I have recently heard however that Lamictal (an anticonvulsant) a mood stabilizer used to treat epilepsy to anxiety, works as a mild antipsychotic in higher dosages. This is baffling as it does not have effects at any dopamine receptor. It is also known that many antipsychotics have loads of nasty side effects. I was just wondering if anyone else has information on this topic and whether they believe that some new medications should focus on glutamate regulation rather than purely dopamine. ",07May2017,2

56,"Wtf am I doing wrong such that therapy is not improving my low motivation and low mood?

I go to class, get out of bed, exercise, eat, hang out with friends and socialize the best I can. I do thought logs but very often there is no thought making me feel depressed and it just is. Meditation/mindfulness makes me very agitated while CBT just doesn't have any effect

I have HPA axis issues and thought therapy would bring them back into balance. Why doesn't it do so?

I have tried a total of 4 different therapists.

Am I doing something wrong? 

Today I tried applying mindfulness and ended up getting so agitated that I broke my phone since it had no effect on my low mood. The only time
My low mood gets better is at night.

But therapy does ABSOLUTELY SQUAT when I need my mood to be boosted in acute situations such as when exams are coming in school. The low mood and low motivation themselves cause me so much stress due to their impact on my studying habits. On the actual test not so much but they directly impede my studying and prior to me getting depressed I did very very well at school. So I want to get back to that point.

😭😭😭😡
