0,"I'm 17 and for years now I've been struggling with social anxiety, shyness, self-loathing, and confidence. These issues have been culminating for a while now and I believe they are getting worse, despite me becoming arguably an all-around better person. I just thought that it was simply just being awkward and just gave it time to get better, and later just came to terms with it. But it's just been getting worse and worse and I can't see the logic behind the anxiety and self-consciousness, and yet its still very prevalent in my behavior. I care WAY too much about what people think of me, sometimes modelling my own personality because of it, and planning out conversations beforehand, in certain social scenarios I simply can't function, and I choke and murmur on my own words, and nothing I think ever comes out how I want it too. I've looked into subreddits like these and seen people with way more isolated and unfortunate childhoods like mine and they seem to be doing much better socially than me, even the ""weird"" kids at school are better at socializing than me.

Just recently, I've been suspecting that this may be way more than  just shyness and awkwardness, and looked into mental illness. It seems highly probable that I have Social Anxiety Disorder, as I fit most of the major symptoms, but I don't want to fully rely on a self diagnosis. My parents thought will not let me see a therapist and they think it's just a teenager phase and won't pay a lot of money on something like that, but nobody else seems to have these issues to the extent that I do. All the friends I've talked to with this have urged me to get a real evaluation, but I have no idea how I can with my circumstances. 

Anyone have any ideas?

Edit: I really don't want to use any medication as I don't trust any of that stuff",03May2017,1

2,"My story first. Enjoy the block of text.
I've had depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder of some sort for over 7 years (when I started college), maybe closer to 10 if I think back to high school. It got progressively worse, until I reached out for help 3 years ago (I was 21, in college), mainly because of my increasing self-harm. I started trying to find a medication winter of 2013, with my GP then a psychiatrist. First, Prozac, a higher dose, then Cymbalta, no change. Then Wellbutrin, until I started hallucinating (that was a fun panic attack). Then Paxil, then higher, then higher, then higher and Abilify. I thought I was getting better then, but my self-harm​ peaked in fall 2014, and I withdrew from college and checked myself into an outpatient program. I thought I need more help after 5 days, so I checked into the inpatient program where I was for 7 days. I changed meds again, Lexapro this time, and went back to college in the spring. Lexapro wasn't working, a higher dose. Didn't work, so moved to Effexor. At this point, I'd like to add that noone has been told about my eating disorder yet (mostly bulimia, some starving, issues off and on but usually on), so I tell my psychiatrist and counselor in 2015. After a year of being on increasing dosages of Effexor, the latest and highest dose sent me into a hypomanic episode (yaaay). Thinking I may actually have bipolar disorder, we added Lamictal. I stopped taking it after a couple weeks because my mood is really inconsistent. Now, it's just Effexor 150mg.
Finally, my question. Text block course two, yum.
I'm fucking tired of pills. Should I just give up on them? After 7 years, I'm finally graduating college (yay, took me long enough), and my situational circumstances have changed a lot in that time. I stopped cutting in late 2015, haven't purged since mid/late 2016. Mom got and survived cancer 2016-17, just lost an eye to her recovery (fungal infection), by she's okay now. I can finally see I'm heading to a real life now... But I'm still not stable. My moods are more unstable now than in the past, now that my Effexor is higher and I've been so up and down since my hypomanic episode. I feel constantly weird/off. My ups and downs aren't seemingly triggered by events, they just happen because. With graduation in 2 weeks, summer will be a good time to wean myself off my meds (fuck you Effexor and your​ horrid withdrawal). My most stable mindset happens right after and the day after I run (I started last summer and have been sporadic since), so could that just be my new Rx? Just running and healthy eating? I just want to live my life. Leave this shit behind. Bury it at my college and never come back.",03May2017,6

5,"i constantly feel like i need to do the opposite of others. this happens everywhere. as an example, when i'm in group settings i never want to laugh at a joke someone makes (if other people laugh at it) and i never want to talk to people if other people are talking. even around friends, i never want to share the same interests or music tastes as them, and i never want to ""be apart of"" the thing that everyone is enjoying. this literally spans across everything, from school to work to activities. it's gotten to the point where, if a few students have figured out the answer to a problem in class, i will literally take the chance of getting the problem wrong rather than go over and partake in the group. but even worse, i don't want any sort of relationship because i feel like that's what everyone else wants and i don't want my desires to align with theirs. it's just a constant sense that i can't and won't partake in what other people are partaking in. 

is this a condition? is it linked to something else? idk, i just know it's really bothersome. any responses are welcomed, thank you ",03May2017,3

7,"Hey everyone,

I have a close friend, hes been a close friend for probably about 15 years.  In the last year he has come to me often about suicidal thoughts, extreme depression, stuff like that.  I really want to help him but I just do not know how.  Sometime I just let him talk at me to see if getting it off his chest helps, but it seems to just get really dark, to the point where I am telling him that suicide is not an option.  I can't relate to his feelings, so I don't know what to say, and just listening doesn't seem to help.  

This is the most recent thing he said to me:

""I just wanna not have to force myself to live... I am so fucking done. For all I try it just gets worse. I don't even care about a positive outlook anymore. I want to feel things again. Its been years and I hit a point where trying to feel/let people get to know me literally causes me physical pain. I am fucking trying I promise. Uugh rant over. Sorry.""

That just came out of no where, we hadn't talked about this stuff in months, and he just randomly sent that to me a few minutes ago.  I don't know what to do, we both live in Colorado if that helps.

Anyways,I've been trying to deal with my explosive behavior, sometimes I practise mindfullness, and it kinda works, but whenever I get a blame for something that's not even my fault, I flip, like when I see the stupidest thing happen or people getting triggered(angrily) by the stupidest thing, I flip.

Sometimes I don't relate with a joke,or something meant to be a joke but it's a nerve hitter,this has even taken a toll on my GF(I always apologize thou I understand it's still not right) and usually consider breaking up with her in my mind, even thou she makes small mistakes,and loves me really much(no, i've never done any physical harm or verbal i just shout that's it, but not her fault on anything) I get triggered, even if its a joke.I've tried almost evreything, even pot, trying to act cool, nope, always end up a douche, I'm considering therapy, because I think I'm gonna need it, and since I can't quit my job, cause...well it's a good job, I'm gonna have to deal with it for a while.

14,"Thank you for reading, I just feel I need someone to listen to me besides her. I can't talk to my friends about stuff like this. I will give a little context first. Anyway here we go-

I'm 23 years old, and I live with just my mom. It used to be me, my sister, my mom, and my dad living together. My dad left when I was 14, and me and my mom got closer. We leaned on each other emotionally very much. My sister was still there, but she was very rebellious, and often times emotionally abusive, so obviously my mom turned to me (and I to her). My sister died from a drug overdose about 4 years ago. She was 18 years old, and it was devastating to both of us (even though I described my sister as abusive, she had a loving side and we always tried to help her turn her life around). And we got even closer, and from then on it's just been me and her. We are about as close as two people could possibly be, and we love each other about as much as two people could possibly love each other. We both feel, at this point, that we are the only ones that have ever understood each other, and the only ones we have ever really connected with.

My concern:

I'm afraid I might be eroticizing maternal love. It's the only love from a woman I've ever really known, and I think my mind is taking the next logical step in love (sex) without me realizing it. I watch pornography on occasion like most other people in the world, but for the past year or so I've noticed that I find myself watching videos of mother and son role-play more and more often. I've always shrugged it off as just a silly fantasy with no basis in reality, but given my home situation, I'm starting to think it's not a coincidence. And I'm having a hard time coming to terms with what this means.

Also, the reason I've decided to post this now is because of a completely unrelated issue and it has kind of scared me into writing this. I'll keep it quick- Since I was little I occasionally had violent thoughts (like anyone else), but they are becoming harder and harder to keep out of my head. I'm basically home alone all day (I'm a self-funding independent filmmaker) and left to my own devices while my mom is at work. And whenever I see a girl walking down the street from my window, I feel like her life is so precious. But another thought always creeps in, and I genuinely want to take her in the house and drain the life out of her eyes (if that sounds oddly specific, it's because that's ALWAYS exactly what the thought and urge is). I am afraid of all of these things that I've written about in this post, and I feel like it's coming to a head all at once. 

I know if I go to therapy they will tell me to put some space between me and my mom, but I really don't want to do that because we need each other so much. It's hard to explain, but if I was away from her I would feel incomplete, like the rest of me was still with her waiting for me to come back and be whole again.

Thanks for listening.

22,"Hi everyone, 

As many as 4% of people may have Trichorillomania (TTM), according to the National Institue of Health, and the condition is 4 times more common among women. For those who do not know what Truchorillomania is, it's a disorder that involves recurrent, irresistible urges to pull out body hair. Over the past few years my TTM has completely spiraled out of control. I'm not entirely sure how it all started nor do I understand why it seems impossible to break this horrible disorder. During a typical session, I twirl my hair until their is a significant knot that appears and I then proceed to un-knot the strands (during the process of the ""un-knotting"" period is when the abundance of hair loss occurs). At this point of my disorder I no longer realize that I am even pulling my hair due to the fact that it has become an every day occurrence. I'm constantly asking myself, ""why the hell is this happening and why the hell cant I stop?"".There are strong evidence that TTM can be a genetic condition. Studies conducted at Duke Universitt Medical Center showed some correlation between gene mutation and Truchorillomania; two mutations in the SKITKR1 gene were shown to be shared by people suffering from the condition, though only a small percentage of the patients shared these mutations. Still, the existence of shared gene mutations among many of the TTM cases gives credit to the theory that there is biological factors involved in the conditions. So is it genetic influence or is due to comorbidity with other mental condition? We often see our hair as a reflection of our identity because it's both personal and public. Hair is one of the first character traits that can be noticed when approaching someone. Many women feel that a bad hair day equals a bad day. TTM creates the feeling of a bad hair day everyday and it becomes an obsession on its own. Not only can TTM enhance low self-esteem issues, there is also an extreme social stigma behind it. When I told my parents that I have been pulled my hair they responded, ""oh are you cutting yourself too?"" and they passed it off as a joke. They didn't understand why I did this nor did they comprehend that it was a problem. I've tried telling people and they just don't understand why it's a problem at all. TTM controls my entire life but I am constantly told by the people I confide in that ""it's just a phase"", ""just buy a fidget gadget"" or ""you should talk to someone about that"". A phase don't last a decade, a gadget doesn't stop the urge and talking to someone doesn't make it stop. It's disheartening to open up to someone about your biggest insecurity after years of poor self-image and have it brushed off. I have pulled enough of my hair, had enough bald spots and had enough infections to know this isn't something just to be brushed off. One day I may be able to leave TTM behind, but as of right now it's only possible to take it one strand at a time. 

I don't expect anyone to read this but it was really liberating to write this and express my story dealing with TTM. Anyone who would like to share your story feel free too, I would love to hear from other coping with TTM. This is a safe environment and all are welcome to write. ",03May2017,3

25,"There is nothing wrong with my physically (other than my brain aha). I'm diagnosed with HFASD but when I am 're-evaluated I will be pushing to be assessed for Borderline PD if that gives you an idea of my mental state, without going into too much detail. 18 and male.

I weighed myself earlier I was 52.1kg a month ago I was almost 56kg! A big achievement for me.  I used to have CFS/ME (Psychosomatic possible it was debated) when I was younger and obviously I couldn't eat all that much. I also had PTSD and ""emotional issues"" according to doctors notes so I never really ate that much to busy fighting off CFS/ME while getting the shit beat out of me or whatever they called me. I was/am severely underweight my entire life. And I love food! I mean I will eat it if someone gives it to me, I eat loads and loads when it is around. I mean I was like well below 5ft and malnourished probably at around 11/12 lol I was being beaten up constantly around that time.... Oh better stop before I start talking about homicidal ideation again! 

So I have existed like this forever! And I want to change it now, I really don't want to die 30 years younger, when I can avoid it. Right now I am bone and muscle, pretty toned muscle at that haha. I do a lot of moving around, with my volunteering, excercise too, but not cardio that would reduce my weight and I don't want to do that. I mean I can move around people 5 times my size or more with ease so? Also should I mention my psychopathically low heart rate which only elevates if the porn is sadistic enough? haha funny Major adrenaline junky I am.

Anyway I have a problem with fixing this right now, I live at home with my parents as I am on my gap year before I study... Psychology aha. My mum has coeliac's and is extremely sensitive, no eating out, no gluten food other than the McCoy's crisps I just ate and put in the bin outside while washing my hands before and after. My point is I am praticularly living off salt and air right now, and obviously I don't have much options to change my diet because I can't compromise my mum's health. 

So what do I do to avoid any further deterioration in my weight, I mean there Isn't much because no one eats much of anything in my family. That sounds callous, but I mean I need a full like cooked meal probably everyday twice a day. I mean I am 5'11 energetic 18yo male so like I literally need it, and I mean I could ask permission to start cooking, I like cooking. 

This brings me on to my next point because of how chaotic my emotions are I find it very difficult to do anything other than basic self-care for myself. I mean I do stuff for other people, but I don't/can't ever find ways to help myself. 

The only time I really become animated is at night time, promise not a vampire, it is because of my Psychosomatic pain problems when I was younger, I felt I could relax at night and it made me feel better so I am conditioned to become more animated at night.

27,"Hey, all. I'm doing as much research as I possibly can on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, TMS or rTMS, mainly due to the $2,500 fee I'll be paying after my insurance does their share. Getting it done may also keep me from leaving a state I no longer want to live in, though, I don't see much success until I deal with my dysthymia and ahedonia.

I've tried about 10-15 medications in the past 6 years and I felt nothing from them, good or bad, besides the last medication. The generic ritalin worked for about 1 to 2 hours at first but then started working less and less. Now I'm lucky if it helps for an hour.

I'm at the point where TMS is doable with as soon as next week but, after what I'm seeing online and hearing from the Doctor, this is simply a gamble whether or not it will work. I know all treatments are, but they haven't cost me $2,500 and had these many variables.

**TL;DR**

Is TMS a worthy chance to take for helping with depression at this point? Is it worth the cost (I'd have to pay $2,500) and time? I know every varies and nothing is guaranteed. I'm more looking for insight on how the treatment is doing in general for those with depression. Thanks.",03May2017,2

How often are we told to trust our gut? Trusting our gut is nothing more than intuition, and although many of the best ideas have come from someone trusting their gut, intuition is incredibly misunderstood.  Anyone who has struggled with an addiction can tell you that sometimes, our gut is just not all that reliable. While I was in early recovery I was very stubborn. I was twenty years old when I came home from treatment and I believed that I knew everything. Looking back now I can see just how many mistakes I have made in my recovery, mistakes that I could have avoided had I asked for help. So, what makes the difference between those times where intuition has been correct, and when it has gone completely wrong? The answer is experience. 
	

Intuition is the sense that we know the answer to a problem, or the right action to take without fully understanding why, or where this information is coming from. While actively using substances as someone with a substance abuse disorder, many of our decisions are made from fear, masked as intuition. We will tell ourselves that we know what we are doing, or we can wean ourselves off. We convince ourselves that we do not need any help, or we should not find support.  When we get an intuitive feeling, it does not come from a mystical universe to tell us what we should be doing. That sense that we know what to do comes from the brain, specifically the more primitive subconscious parts of our brain, and they come from experience. 
Intuition is much like driving a car. When we first learn to drive, we feel a little uncomfortable and we make mistakes. If we are not paying attention we cannot trust ourselves to drive safely and often we have a lapse in judgement. However, the longer we continue to drive the more comfortable we feel behind the wheel. Many times, we could be driving long distances thinking about what we will eat for dinner, or the conversation we just had with a friend and not even remember driving home, yet we get home safely. With experience our subconscious minds begin to learn the rules of driving, we learn what to look out for and if another car almost hits us we suddenly act and avoid the accident. This is not done with any forethought, we react intuitively, and it is because we have this experience behind the wheel.
	

When in early recovery our experience with rebuilding our lives is limited, and therefore we do not know what to in tricky situations. When times get tough, or we experience a craving we may feel tempted to try and handle our problems on our own, but we do so with limited knowledge about ourselves and about recovery. Many times, in early recovery I let my gut put me in some dangerous situations, all because I was not willing to ask for advice. The reason I could move forward in my recovery was because I was not willing to stop trying; my problem was that I did not ask for advice when I needed it. My intuition led me to believe things like having a girlfriend, or going out with friends would be the key to my happiness. Sometimes my intuition would lead me into bad financial decisions, like taking out a loan I was not sure I could pay. Sometimes my intuition would lead me to make poor choices in how to handle situations with my family and friends which caused stress or drama. The fact of the matter was that I did not have the experience in life to know the right moves to make.
	

A problem that is common for many people, especially people recovering from a substance abuse problem is the desire for instant gratification. Although it would be nice to go to treatment and be completely changed into the person we desire to be, it is our desire for instant gratification that holds us back from growing at all. True learning is something that takes time, repetition and patients. Much like a toddler learning how to walk, we are very unbalanced when we first begin.  We may only be able to stand up at first, but after falling many times, we learn to take our first steps. As we continue to improve, we will still fall and make mistakes, however, each day brings more improvement until we learn how to run. Much like walking, recovery must become something we do not have to think about with effort, it is something that must become a part of who we are. With time and practice we can then take these improvements to any level we wish. Even if we wish to become marathon runners, or sprinters, we have learned the process of growth and development to obtain any level of success. However, much like world class athletes, having a mentor is a terrific way to improve at a much faster and safer rate.  
	

It was only after years in my recovery that I gained the experience that allowed me to develop habits and insights that led me in positive direction. I had to take time to learn about myself, I had to learn about the ways I had become conditioned to react to life, just like it takes time to learn how to react to a car swerving into your lane. When I became aware of my habits and my automatic responses to life I was given a power I had never experienced; I was given a choice. I can now understand who I am, where my behaviors come from and how I react to events in life; with that understanding comes the ability to change. I had to decide what I wanted and found others who have already obtained those desires, so that I may learn from them. With that knowledge and experience, I have come to trust my intuition. With practice, my intuition has brought me to places I once thought to be impossible for myself. I now trust myself, and even find that I can mentor others to do the same, this all came from practice.
	

There are always going to be mistakes in recovery, in fact, there will always be mistakes in life. These mistakes are not failures, these mistakes are learning experiences. Sometimes in our recovery, we may even use, or what some call a relapse, however, a relapse is only a failure if we give up and stop trying. Most people who enter recovery do so because they had spent years living a destructive life fueled by addiction, so it is only natural that recovery takes time, and it takes consistent learning. It is ok to make mistakes, it is ok to have a setback, because if we are learning from our mistakes we are always growing in the right direction. If you are a person in early recovery understand you are going to make mistakes, and that is why it is important to ask for help and learn from those who have come before you. Once you teach your mind how you want it to react in life, following your gut suddenly becomes the best thing to do.

34,"Context: I am a 25yo male, and I have a girlfriend which I currently live with.

Sorry if this post rambles on, I have had a lot of suppressed feelings which I need to get out and any advice would be incredible as I feel lost. 

From a young age possibly due to being raised in a house full of women with no real father figure (or maybe it's just a part of me) I have always felt inadequate as a man. My sisters used to play dress up and find it fun putting me in dresses when I was little which I think is pretty normal? However from a young age once they grew out of it I started to dress up myself in private. However once the excitement wore of I would become ashamed and disgusted with myself. When I became old enough to discover porn I descended further down the wormhole to the point that the only way I became aroused was when I fantasised about being made into a masters sissy slave. Now I have been told that I am a quite attractive man so have always had women come on to me and have had many girlfriends which I loved greatly, but could never become sexual with so it would always end.  Hence I am now a 25 year old virgin, with a understanding but confused gf.

This is where I feel like my personality is split. I work as a manual labourer now, I have a muscular body and  pretty head strong. I find myself quite naturally assertive as well. I love my girlfriend and find the thought of kissing a man a real turn off. BUT there is another part of me that has just gotten more and more deprived, in moments of arousal I still dress up in lingeries and have even started exploring anally. Part of me just yearns to be dominated and just owned by a master. 

I don't mean to put people off there cereal with the nasty details and I understand we all have fetishes and that's normal enough. But the strong male me (which i am like 90% of the time) yearns to be able to have a normal relationship with my gf (of 2 years!) and just lead a happy 'normal' life. The other part of me feels disgusted at the thought of being with a woman and wants to just go down the rabbit hole so to speak. This has led me to feel like I live a fake life pretending to be normal, caused me severe depression and anxiety. Basically I just find no joy in life as I don't feel like me? 

I have no clue who I am and what to do. I don't know whether the strange fetish aspect of me was created from my feelings of shame, I don't know if I find sex with a female a turn off because I am scared or because I am gay I suppose?!? I can't tell anyone I know as no one would believe me, I am known as the 'stud' of the group.


Please help??

Tl:dr I have a split personality that clash, causing me depression and a feeling of fakeness.

Edit: My gf doesn't know any of this, it blew my friends minds when I had to tell them I was depressed as I couldn't hide it at uni and the normal response was ""what no way you are the life of the party!""

Edit2: Incase it is relevant, which I feel it is. I also have always been embarrassed by my penis size, it is very small flaccid however when erect is pretty average I am starting to realise. But it still plagues me too this day the feeling of embarrassment. ",03May2017,2

Long story short, I hate my job. It leaves me stressed and tired and I can't do it anymore. Unfortunately this is the same thing I've felt with other retail and hospitality jobs. It takes a toll on my mental health and I'm not sure what jobs would be better for me. Dealing with so many people in a day leaves me drained.

I'd love to know what you think are depression friendly jobs, how to get them etc... 
Advice and help is appreciated. ",03May2017,13

45,"So I don't know if I'm just socially awkward or what, but most of the time I just don't feel like talking. 

I'm completely fine with texting and whatever else but when it comes to verbal communication, it becomes a chore to me and I have to physically force myself to do so most of the time. 

Another thing is that when people are engaging​ in conversation with me, I can't help but reply with weak answers (one or a few words). It's as though my mind goes completely blank and I don't know what to say. I'm noticing this more and more and I feel like an idiot. It doesn't even just happen with people that I'm not really acquainted with, it happens with close family members also (Mum, Dad, Siblings) as well as my boyfriend. 

I prefer to be in my own headspace (is the excuse I give) but I do wish this problem could be resolved and I could talk to people normally. What can I do to resolve this? ",03May2017,3
46,"My cousin, who has psychosis, told me yesterday that he has vivid delusions and he perceives time different sometimes. It's like time distortion and it happens when something triggers it. This is an example he told me: Once our granny was coming over to his house so he hid because he just didn't want to talk to her, he heard the car pull up the driveway but nobody answered the door for a minute or so, so he looked out the window and saw the car just pulling up, this was the trigger, he suddenly had delusions of this happening many times and that time was looped and distorted in his mind.

I know psychosis can cause people to have delusions beyond reality but can they be this vivid? Thanks for reading this and I hope someone here would be able to tell me if this is a common or a rare to psychosis symptom.",03May2017,1
47,"I'm pretty sure I'm going to be fired, I've called in sick to work for 2 days in a row and now I'm panicking and am about to call in for a 3rd day, none of my calming exercises are working.

I'm inbetween primary care providers atm, out of xanax, my depression is at an all time low, I know for a fact if I go into work today it'd mess me up.

I don't know what to do anymore, with all of my health problems holding a job has been impossible, if I can't work like a normal person does that just mean I become homeless and just die like nobody cares about me?",03May2017,1

49,"Hi guys, new to this sub. Anyway my friend is dealing with depression and occasional anxiety. She already went to the doctor and his getting help. What I wanted to know is how can I help her cope with it when she is feeling extra down. We are close so I check on her everyday and ask her if she wants to unwind and let of steam. But some days she really can't do mutch, today she wasn't even able to leave the house and because of that she ends of feeling useless. In these situations the only help that I can seem to provide is loving words but that sometimes isn't enough. So I wanted to ask if there are any other ways to be a support system to my friend?",03May2017,2

52,"I have always been a little bit socially awkward but I have always had friends and a wonderful family and upbringing. However now when I am an adult ( 33M ) and I am getting further in my career and relations with other people are a bit more complicated I can see some problems. When I think back the problems have always been there but they are much more obvious and cause bigger problems now when I am an adult.

I am having problems concentrating, I think my hearing is fine but I constantly have to ask people ""What"" and ""Come again"" because what they say do not register. This happens with everybody, including people I am comfortable with like my girlfriend. I also get socially anxious around people that I do not think mean we well. I do not believe I am unintelligent but a good example is when a certain co-worker that does not like me ask me a question, I just freeze I can barely manage to give the answer to 1+1, its like everything just shuts down. Along people I am comfortable with I am however very self-confident and feel like I can take on the world. 

My mind is always wandering, constantly and it makes it hard for me to fall asleep. I have some sort of memory issue and I do not know if this is connected to the sleep. But I can ask somebody what they did for the weekend and five minutes later I will forget about it and ask the same question again. Most days I get around 7 hours of sleep but 1-2 days a week I get 3-4 hours. Managing my office job really drains me because it requires such a high level of concentration for me.

I do not feel depressed, I would describe myself as a happy person but it is hard for me to activate myself. If I could get away with, like if my girlfriend would go away for a month I would lay in bed every single day to read and play games.

Could it just be that I am absent minded and a bit on the lazy side or could there be something else going on? Writing this is hard for me since it is extremely hard for me to pursue this subject and I would really appreciate any input.",03May2017,1
53,"I'm currently working on a project that will use machine learning to help make you happier. I've been spending the past few months surrounding by white boards and now I want to test out the first attempt at, what I'm calling, my theory of happiness. If any of you have any experience with machine learning you'll know that the most important thing is having the data. That's were you come in. It'd be great if you could help me by tracking your happiness over time along with several other things. If you'd like to help out then please drop me a message. Thanks!

57,"Okay, so I'm not going to pretend I'm some expert writer or anything like that because I'm far from it. What I am is a 30 something guy from England who just wanted to say out loud what of a lot of men my age won't admit.
I just want to tell you that you are not alone and that I feel your pain so share it. Get it off your chest. Let the world understand that just because it's invisible doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.
I'm talking about depression and anxiety.
A little background about myself. Ive had problems with depression and anxiety for about 16 years now. Ive probably suffered from it since my teens in all honesty but back in the 90's you were seen as weak if you had depression but to be fair I didnt even know what it was back then because no one really spoke about it. You were seen as a mental case. My worse time came about 7 years ago where I decided to try and kill myself on 3 separate occassions. All 3 were unsuccessful. You maybe sitying there reading this and saying to yourself, ""3 times! He didnt want to do it really!""and you know you could be right but i can honestly say that atvthe time all I wanted to do was end my life, wholeheartedly. Maybe subconsciously maybe I didnt and it was a cry for help or maybe I'm just very bad at getting the job done. I honestly dont know but I do know how I felt at the time. I was then sectioned for a few months for my own safety. Over the last year and a half I have fallen in and out of severe depression and contentment. I cant say though that at anytime over the last 18 months I was trully happy.
A little about me. I'm British, I'm in my thirties, I'm single, I have a good job, fantastic friends, a good and supportive family but.....
I AM ALONE!
That's right, I have what the content person would call a good life. However to me, it never feels that way. I know I do but it's like I can't comprehend the fact I do. I feel constantly alone. I can be in a crowd of people, my best friends, my family and yet I will still feel alone. The best way I can describe it to people is being trapped inside a bubble with water slowly rising and being unable to escape.
I wake up in the morning and for a split second it's bright and beautiful, then reality creeps up and the bubble starts filling again. I try to find the self believe to claw at this unbreakable bubble. I sit there and try to forget. I drag myself up and try to occupy myself away from this feeling but still the bubble fills. Then comes the moment I have to leave the house. I pull my body and mind up, which is getting heavier and heavier as the minutes of the day tick on. I go to put my clothes on, trying to fight the urge to cancel what ever I'm meant to being doing, whether that be going to work or seeing friends or family. 80% of the time I manage to drag myself out just so people dont suspect that there is anything wrong me because I don't like worrying people. It's also probably worth noting to I dress my bubble up really nice before I go anywhere as that's my daily disguise. I then drag myself around in this bubble all day fighting this feeling of impending doom that hits me again and again and again. By the time I'm on my way home, all I can think about is whether I can do this same thing everyday and whether I should just keep on driving to the nearest cliff and go over.
However the good news for me is I live with my 2 friends so they get home and I come back down to earth, until the morning where the routine happens all over again.
I'm lucky because I have that support there atvthe moment but there are people who don't. People who hard it better than me. What I can say is that there are signs. The smile which disappears when they think your not looking. The person who would come out all the time and now hardly at all. Yes those are examples of big signs but it's these changes you need to look out for. 
Even the smallest change in personality could be the indication of a bigger problem. 
Don't ignore it if it is unusual. 
Don't fob it off as a one of occasion. 
Don't take 'I'm fine' as a final answer. 
Don't believe it's not a real problem just because you can't see it. 
Don't tell them to grow up or snap out of it.

Offer a hand.
Offer a hug.
Offer a ear.
Offer a hand.
Offer them help.

Just let them know your there if they need you.

You could save someone's life.
