The only medication that ever caused them before was buspiron and I stopped taking that 2 months ago and the zaps almost immediately stopped.

5,"I've done inpatient stays twice in my life (once voluntary, once involuntary) for suicidal thoughts. 

Over the last two or three days, those thoughts have been returning, including some specific plans of suicide by cop.

I'm thinking the meds I'm on are out of whack.  

I'm not comfortable going back into inpatient for a med adjustment, as I feel like I'm treated like a prisoner. I guess what I'm asking is do inpatient care wards exist where I'd be allowed proper writing utensils and not flexible safety pens? A place where I'd be allowed to have my phone or iPad and real shoes with laces?

Someone with multiple lifelong serious mental health issues that other people would look at and say 'what must have happened to them?'.

7,"I don't have health insurance or a job, and I have anxiety and depression that doesn't let me function normally. I live in the US (oregon). Several years ago my doctor prescribed me xanax which led me to quit my job and drop out of college. Ever since then I've been working shitty jobs. I've had issues with addiction since. I went to therapy twice and they wanted to take me off the meds and put me on anti-depressants but I'm scared of the meds since they already fucked me over once. I also find it extremely difficult to be open with anyone, much less share anything truthful with a therapist (if I ever have money to see one). I feel like anything I say will be used against me to profit them, not to help me, even if they are delusioned to thinking they are helping. But I am considering anti-depressants. I live in sort of a hippie town now so I can probably find alternative treatments but I'm also afraid and broke. I'm currently not ""on my feet"", and I need to get back up somehow. It's really affecting my relationship with my partner..... she's starting to get tired of helping me and seeing me struggle, not to mention she has her own problems too.

My depression is heavily rooted in the way society functions, being a minority... and... well I dont even know what else, but I know it's a chemical imbalance cause there are rare days when I feel normal and can function. It's also very nihilistic and existential. I wake up not wanting to exist. I dread the day. I look forward to sleep.

Please point me in the right direction with something that is potentially free. Please don't recommend supplements I can't afford, I seriously can't right now.

9,"Throwaway account. And I want to preface this with I am not a threat to myself or others. 

Generally speaking I'm not a happy person, but I'm not really depressed either. I'd say most of them time my mood is probably between a 4-7 (out of 10). But when I go to sleep, or attempt to go to sleep I become severely depressed. I constantly think about how much I hate my life and my self, and fantasize about dying and occasionally say to myself why not just kill myself (again I've never attempted nor actually considered doing it but the thought has crossed my mind thousands of times ). 

It's something that's been going on with me for at LEAST 15 years (into my childhood, I'm now in my 30s). I don't understand it at all, and why I do this or how to remedy it.

13,"Hi, i am a male, 16 years. Don't want to make this long so I'll do my best to keep it short. First of all, I live with a single mother, who has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and I've always been emotionally distant from her ever since I knew she wasnt healthy to be around. Screaming one minute, trying to kiss me the next. Pretty much scared the shit out of me as a younger child. So that is a major cause right there. Next, I was lucky enough to be involved with a girl who was Bipolar, and extremely clingy, and considering I was already lacking emotional needs, this was like a high for me, until after 2 years she broke my heart by getting with my best friend. I was too stupid to realize teenage love isn't actually that promising. Now to the present. It's been a year since all of that, and i was intelligent enough to stop and look at myself. Instead of becoming a cold hearted fuck boy, and not caring about girls emotions, I somehow convinced myself that i just needed to search for another girl and all my pain would be over once I found ""the one"" and blah blah blah. I was literally creating fantasies in my head, keep in mind I'm only 16 and a guy, hahaha. I have talked to girls in the past and had a few things since that breakup, but none were too interesting for me. I was very depressed and still am a bit now, but much better. I've realized that there's something obsessive going on in my head, and instead of enjoying my life and then having relationships on the side, I am making women and relationships my WHOLE life. It's so unhealthy how needy I am of their emotional support. I think about girls and women all the time, just wishing I could find the right girl but also have a distant attachment to them. Meaning that I want them extremely bad, but when one actually gets close, I have bad anxiety and wonder wtf am I doing. I should be living right now and hanging out with friends and going out, not obsessively trying to fill an emotional void I have. thank you for all replies and if I posted this in the wrong place, feel free to move it as I am new here.

17,"My father is in his mid 50s and was diagnosed bipolar in his early 40s. His diagnosis has stayed the same over the years as he continues to see the same psychiatrist who gave him the original diagnosis. He has been taking Lamictal to treat his condition. That being said I do not believe he is bipolar, I believe his Ivy League psychiatrist isn't worth shit considering the meetings I've had with him to discuss my own well being and my fathers (and also asking for advice on how to cope with my father). 

Mania:

My father is an angry individual. He snaps at the most microscopic details in his daily life and he takes out this anger on himself and his family. As a child and even in his 20s he has been described as a very high energy person. I see this in myself, more so when I was younger (I am currently 24). Despite being a high energy person I do NOT see this as the same thing as being in a Manic phase. He has never had a drinking/ drug problem, he has never cheated on my mother, he never isolated himself from his children, he does not become obsessed with small or large project.

Depression: 

My father has definitely shown a loss if interest in life and this becomes more apparent as he gets older. He did go through a mid life crisis in his 40s and this is the time of his life when he started seeing a bunch of psychiatrist. These assholes were perscribing him medications from Klonopin to SSRI's to Lithium. As stated before the only medication he takes today is Lamictal. So it seems he became severely depressed at one point in his life and came out with a bipolar diagnosis. I do not believe he is Bipolar.

His Condition:

He definitely has some OCD tendacies. For example he could be fixing a door in the house and the door would have to be absolutely perfect and it would drive him nuts until it was fixed to perfection. He has a hard time expressing himself verbally, he tends to stutter a lot and cannot complete full sentences with conveying his message. This next part I explain is where I believe his psychiatrist gave him the wrong diagnosis: he could wake up and have a normal day and everything could be going his way, his favorite football team winning, he could have his favorite breakfast meal, the weather outside could be beautiful and he could convincingly be in a great mood. Then as mentioned before something miniscule could happen and it sets him off to be in a shit mood for the next couple hours. This bad mood consist of anger aggression and high temper. He says things that don't make any sense when he's angry and I believe he does not realize the things he is saying when he's angry. He does not go through manic and depressive episodes.

I would love for anyone's advice on this, I have a horrible relationship with my father I cannot speak with him about normal things or serious things. I live in the same house as him and I honestly cannot wait to move away from him. There's no one else in this world that makes me feel more uncomfortable.

Thanks.

I always thought traveling would bring me happiness, but I went abroad for the first time, I actually spiraled further into depression, and have absolutely no will to live at this point. I've struggled with depression all my life. I thought maybe traveling would help, and it was a dream I clutched onto tightly. I always thought, maybe I wasn't the problem. Maybe it was my environment. I feel absolutely disappointed and hopeless about this situation. It finally hit me that I won't be happy no matter where I am - that I am the problem, and traveling won't help me escape my mind. I have tried everything there is. I go to therapy, take medication, the whole jist - everything they say that helps. I so badly want to be cured. I hate feeling this way. I hate it so much. What can I do to feel at least feel a little bit alive? Has anyone else suffered this?

Sometimes, it's hard to forget that things won't feel this way forever. It's helpful to know I'm not alone. It pops that bubble of isolation and loneliness.

20,"Ok so first off if you haven't heard of 'High-Functioning Depression' (HFD) then just google it or pop over here:
https://www.fisherwallace.com/blogs/mental-health-topics/do-i-have-high-functioning-depression
There is a pretty quick and concise summery of it all.

Alternatively the wiki on this subject i'm also including to further clarify what i'm referring to in a more broad sense, here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia

Ok so supposedly HFD candidates are perfectly capable of living and functioning through life just like most other forms of depression or conditions like Asperges and even Autism . However what uniquely denotes the HFD subset is apparently a long term depressive state - be it frequent or intermittent - which is persistent regardless of the **presence** or **lack of presence** of traditional associative factors known to cause depression.


So a HFD can be very outgoing extrovert and successful, but still internally exist in a persistent depressive state - and of course they can be introvert, anxious and coast through life - but again also with the same persistent internal depressive state. Or indeed be anywhere along the proverbial spectrum between the two. Again, the defining factor is the persistent depressive state which is **non-relational** to any form of stimulus know to cause said depressive states, be they clinical or otherwise.


Now my question is this, does a HFD at the top end of that spectrum, ever have a valid case to make when they sight their perspective of the world and the nature of the limiting factors uniquely attribute to themselves as a logically valid rational for self euthanasia ?

Or is the law &amp; societal convention as well as the moral viewpoint that preservation of life above all else, even above quality of life, means that steps to preserve the life of the individual should never be rescinded - no matter what. Even if logical and rational explanations can be given for the argument for self euthanasia. Or possibly will there even be a time when this societal &amp; moral imperative will be more subjective so to speak, and be open to compromise ?


Because as far as I can see, basically in modern psychiatry and psychotherapy even after everything has been tried, every treatment and every drug has been tried, but the patient still is plagued by their medically and socially condemned perspective on life - the only recourse the profession and society seem willing to accept under those circumstances is permanent incarceration. And to force the individual to exist just for existing sake. Simply because they can't have it on their moral consonance that they 'allowed' a individual to die.


Now I should state I am referring to a hypothetical scenario consisting of **only** the mental and physiological factors described above. This scenario **does not** include self euthanasia in cases with patients suffering from terminal diseases and disability conditions.

So what are your thoughts ? Is there ever a case where you would allow someone to euthanize them self given the factors described ?

Ps, I Just want to add that the purpose of this post is **not** meant to be inflammatory, it is just purely a look at a currently socially taboo concept, done in a hypothetical context, in order to make it easier &amp; safer to discuss.

I fucked all that off as soon as I walked past the building and saw a group of 20+ applicants, I just carried on walking. I was looking forward to this for a week or 2 as I've had several interviews in the last month that have gone well I personally feel. The part I feel the worst about is the fact I've let down family who were happy to see me excited about something, and now I'm either going to have to let them down yet again or just outright lie to their face and just say I didn't get it. Along with family there is also a person I've been seeing who after hearing this I seem to think she will think much less of me, even though she knows about my anxiety etc. I don't think I've told her the full extent.

25,"I know, ultimately, that seeing a doctor to discuss this sort of stuff should be my ""go to"" but Reddit always seems to hear/help me out a little better. I struggle with depression (wooo surprise!) 
 The standard run of things with me is some emotional flatlining here, some lack of interest there and a whole lot of sleeping. I never really have a change in diet and my depressive episodes are relatively never changing over all. At this point, I'd like to think I'm pretty jaded to it and know what to expect but this time around has definitely taken me down more pegs than I have to climb. I've been feeling insanely guilty about not completing tasks. My mind is all over the place at all times but my body WILL NOT move in response to it. I'm smart enough to know what this sounds like (depression) but it just feels a whole lot different than the usual run of the mill. The problem here isn't the guilt. The problem is that this has turned into a lack of sleep. I spend my entire day feeling guilty about doing anything outside of my responsibilities and so I, in turn, lay in bed doing nothing. I don't really know why but (depriving myself of rewards or saving myself from guilt... one of the two) either way, I keep doing this HOPING that it'll force me to finish tasks and allow me to move on and enjoy things but it's a faulty method. Now I'm just glued to the confines of my room. Eventually, night rolls around and, mind you, I am DEFINITELY tired. However, once night rolls around, the guilt dissipates and then I refuse to sleep because it feels like I didn't get to enjoy the things I regularly enjoy. So, I stay up tackling every hobby I have until It's all a mindless mess. I absolutely can't sleep because the feeling that I didn't enjoy the day enough WILL NOT subside. I fight the sleep and drive myself to insanity trying to cram drawing, reading, painting, gaming and binging all in to one collective situation. The result is a tired, miserable time where only half of me is functioning well enough to understand that I'm moving. Finally, about 4 AM I'll crash, wake up a few hours later and repeat this whole process again. I've always had a hard time completing tasks as well as a separate but equally hard time with guilt over all but lack of sleep has NEVER been a problem. I'm approaching the one week mark of this routine and I've never felt so out of it in my life. I feel quite literally insane and don't know what I'm hoping to gain from this post. Help? I think that's the word. Tips, knowledge to shed light I may be in the dark about? anything please. As always, and in advance, thanks Reddit for being cool.

He stole he security badge (I work in a secure facility) and took off, using the badge to get off the unit and into the connecting hallway. 

He then got lost, and I watched on the security cameras while helping my co-worker off the ground and called security. He ended up on another until like the one he had come from, a dead end. As he turned to escape again, security showed up and had to use their tasers to get him to stand down.

 All 4 security officers took shots at him, the first hit him and he stumbled, but kept trying to run past them. The second two missed, and the 4th finally connected and subdued him.

I just can't maintain friendships. They're so much fucking work. I never got invited to a party in high school and ever since then.

45,"I am a 29 year old female from Argentina. In less than a year I should be graduating medical school, live with my father, and teach English and translate for money.

The mental health issues began as early as four years old. The workers at the kindergarden I was attending noticed ""behaviours"" and advised my parents to take me to a specialised psychologist. I never got specific information about which behaviours these were and why they merited help, but fast forward to sixteen: I'd already been treated by four different psychologists. In my country the mental health field is regrettably cornered by psychoanalysis (which is nowadays evidenced to be a dangerous form of pseudotherapy) so I am not shocked these treatments with these psychoanalysts never helped me and made me swear off ever consulting with a therapist again. Around that time (16) I had a nervous collapse one early morning and was rushed to the emergency services where a doctor finally had the common sense to indicate psychiatric treatment. In the beginning I was put on medication but wasn't very compliant because of the side effects and overall previously acquired mistrust of mental health professionals. Some two years after the collapse incident the overall state of my person had deteriorated to a point I'm not even going to try and describe, also because many of you know of these conditions - ""better off dead by all accounts"". I was around 18. My mother (who had been a more or less decent mother up until that point) sat me down and explained that she couldn't live like that anymore and that I needed to move out. I had nowhere to go (I had very recently finished secondary school), so I simply stayed in my house. Her response to that was packing up, having my father pay for a luxury home in a very expensive side of town for her, moving out with my two underage siblings never to be heard from again. Our extended family is very numerous and this move needed some sort of justification so she went out of her way to let every last family member know that she feared for everyone's physical safety if we remained under the same roof and other unspeakable accusations which permanently ruined my family's image of me (it wasn't hard getting her to admit in private she'd lied). The whole ordeal was justified as (literal quotation) ""if couples can divorce, parents can divorce their children"". Now. Here is something about parental abandonment most people who don't suffer it never get to know. When your mother/father dies the news get out, people expect you to be sad and upset, they offer their condolences and support and sometimes even empathise and feel bad for you. A parent openly rejecting you hurts a thousand times over. It should be obvious why, but in case it isn't, the one person who has the obligation to be with you for life considered that you were no longer worth anything to them anymore, moved on, enjoys luxury trips and rests in a luxury home and is an overallsatisfied person who has continually expressed relief that they no longer have you in their lives. Them dying would imply none of this. A parent dying also doesn't say anything about you as a person, whereas a parent publicly manifesting not loving you or having any type of concern will automatically and permanently convince you that you are worthless. If your own mother couldn't bring herself to love you, nobody else will.

So after she fled I've been on medication but have had my moments of collapse as well. Around the age of 27 I was almost hospitalised for alcoholism (thankfully I don't have that problem anymore). I tried to take my own life twice. Finally during the alcoholism era I landed at the office of a psychologist who was not a psychoanalyst but a cognitive behavioural therapist and was given the tools to work on myself in such a way that everyday life was more tolerable, to the point of going from chronic mental patient to only having to see her every 2 weeks. I was doing great.

Because I am at my final year of medical school I go to class/study/work for very long hours. I neglected getting more medication and ran out by the end of last week.

Don't. Do. This.

I'm confident I can get my doctor to give me new prescriptions in a few hours but the insane amounts of denial about my past I need every day in order to get on with life vanish when not on medication and honestly after about 2 years of forgetting for a while about wishing to die I'm thinking about those things again.

I only wanted to warn you to take your medication and not go off of it",10Jul2017,7
46,"Sometimes I go to sleep and ill wake up really late at night like 2-4am and my mind will be straight up 115% overdrive thinking. The migraine is hot and hurts quite badly, but the worst part is the thinking. I have to consciously fight through my own thoughts to force myself to stop thinking. Ill just ramble/rant through anything making up stories and shit about literally anything, or Ill go through the same couple of words over and over and over and over as my brain is like throbbing in pain. I have to force myself to wake up completely. I have to get up and put water in my face and hair and look at myself in the mirror and try to bring myself back to reality and out of my own head. Just any external stimulus. It's like sleep paralysis of the brain, except with a shitload of pain.

I wonder what this is. I remember 4-5 instances of this happening. There is a wonderful catharsis as I finally settle down to sleep. ",10Jul2017,1
47,"I didn't have the gut feeling that I even meant that. I don't think it is depression because I don't feel sad or suicidal. I just feel flat I guess. I still gain pleasure in mindless activities that I can do while being ""spaced out"" like video games. I went to university and flunked out within my first year. Felt stressed, but eventually became complacent at community college. Nothing improved in community college. I feel stressed about telling people about this not about my situation. I don't feel the consequence of my situation. Life is kind of a blur, days fly by where I don't remember exactly what I am doing but it usually is mindless browsing, playing games sitting at my desk or at the library at college when I should be doing work. I see deadlines but eventually I tell myself skipping assignments is OK and I fail midterms and tell myself it is OK and so on. In my personal life ... well whatever is left of it, I lost contact with all my college friends and high school friends. It bothers me but it doesn't ... hard to explain. I just don't FEEL it. I stopped contacting pretty much of them, I don't really feel it anymore. For example if my friend's birthday was coming up I would remind myself to wish him and then the day passes by and I don't do it. Even the laziest people get the work done, but I don't. I don't feel guilty even though I am burdening my parents with expenses. If they were to stop paying, I would probably end up not improving. I would feel the stress for a day but then feel numb again. I was diagnosed with ADHD, maybe it was a misdiagnosis? Perhaps depression. The only reason I posted this is because I am feeling that short lasting stress, my grades came in and I failed two courses after my second attempt at them. Any ideas what it could be? ",10Jul2017,3
48,"I've been with her 4 Years and her mother comes from time to time in our conversations. Her mother started changing when they moved from Poland to this country(also in Europe). She was 13, mother got sick, she went after 2 years back to Poland so the grandpa could take care of her. Parents got divorced and it has been like that since then. Sometimes they will visit her once a year or so but that is it. How should someone deal with it? Should she go to psychologist? She says they are too expensive, but in my opinion it is the best way as is a serious and not common situation. She will of course get sad about it, and sometimes  about how the family deals with her (sometimes is she in a mental hospital sometimes back to the grandpa but everything is expensive and her family doesn't want to.contribute) .

At first I freaked out as I thought to myself that I definitely turned it off, but now that I think of it, I can't really remember turning it off, hence I said it's a 'hazy memory'.

51,"Sorry this is a bit long and complicated but I will try my my best to summarize.

Maternal grandmother had brief relationship with a man, which produced my mother (I have my mom's birth certificate with his name and his parents name on it.) This man then married and adopted a son. My mom has only had brief contact with this man. I have tried to contact him a few times with no response. I  am assuming he wants nothing to do with us since it would upset his new family. Understandable. 
Really, I am looking for answers into the health history of this man and his family. My mother presents with severe mental issues (since childhood and progressively getting worse). I have dealt and am dealing with my own issues as well. Mom's  side of family has no known mental health issues. That leaves my mother's paternal side.
Since I cannot reach this man. I found his adopted son on social media.
Last thing I want is to shatter this guys world, especially if he knows nothing of me and my mother.  But I just want to know if there is a family history of mental health issues, what they are, if any or if it was just the luck of the draw.
Or, is there another way to find my family history.

Note: this man's family is from Spain and Mexico so not sure if there is access to DNA ancestry reg.",10Jul2017,3

53,"So I have a friend from ages back, we used to smoke pot together. He has always been pretty ""out there"", but lately things have taken a pretty dark turn. He is now convinced that he is being stalked as preparation to be used in a satanic sacrificial ritual. Everything that happens to him is validation that people are conspiring against him. His neighbours have been paid to make loud noises at night, his barber gave him a bad hair cut to intentionally mess with his mind. His flat has been broken into, drugs have been planted. He thinks microwaves are being beamed at him to mess with his hormones. His food is being spiked with cocaine.

Everyone who tells him he is delusional is just a part of the conspiracy and are out to get him. He does have the mental health team on his case and I think they are keeping an eye on him, but as far as he is concerned they are just a part of the enemy and are just making everyone believe he is insane so they can take him away to sacrifice him.

There is a lot more. He can talk for hours about all the coincidences that point to a global conspiracy against him.

Normally he is the most peaceful, loving person I know, but lately he told me how he took a blade into the hospital because he thought he was having a heart attack. When the doctors refused to treat him he pulled the blade out and threatened to slash his wrists. This is the first violent act I have ever seen from him and it makes me think things are going to another level.

He has also started talking about suicide.

Normally I am just a friendly ear to listen to his problems. The other day I mentioned to him about another mutual friend who had some mental issues and she had to be watched closely because she was trying to set fire to her curtains. That night apparently someone built a fire outside his front door. He thinks this was more than a coincidence. He keeps mentioning this to me. I don't know if he thinks I tried to set fire to his house or what, but I am really feeling uncomfortable with his tone.

I really don't know what to do. I love the guy and I am really worried about him. I am also now worried about my safety and my daughters safety. I don't know where to turn. I don't know how I can help him. I don't know how I can keep my family safe, if indeed they are in any danger.

This is all just pretty confusing..",10Jul2017,1

55,"Am I just a selfish prick or a downright sociopath?

Empathy, Sympathy, I feel it all. I just don't really care. Not trying to sound edgy or anything, I just find it hard to care. I know how bad embarrassment is, I know how bad rejection is. I just don't really care.

I'm pretty sure it's not sociopathy (because they don't feel or understand empathy) but I don't know what else it could be. I love attention if that helps and I love my brothers and sisters (I genuinely care for them).

But anyone else, even my best friend, I don't really care for. If they were to die I would only care for myself (i.e, I no longer have a friend to go out and drink with). 

Is this just being a selfish cunt? I feel kind of weird for being like this but I'm curious as to how common it might actually be. I know i'm not a sociopath/psychopath because I understand empathy, I feel empathetic towards my family and I don't want to kill people.

What the fuck am I exactly? I feel so weird because I don't want to come across as some ""AM I A SOCIOPATH GUISE"" edgy teenager, I just want to be directed into the right direction as to what I might actually be. Be it normal or be it a weird selfish cunt.",10Jul2017,1

59,"I feel like I'm starting to stagnate a little. I used to be more active and exciting, always had something to offer in the conversations. Now I just feel dull and like I am not learning anything new, not experiencing anything new. I used to love reading and educating myself, motivated to do all sorts of things such as photography and drawing, playing music, sewing, dancing, exercising. Past few years I've been working a lot so it seems like I am just too tired to do any of this anymore, and end up just laying down at home to watch some dumb tv shows until I pass out. Also due to this, I don't get to see any of my friends, although I crave human interactions. Whenever I do go out though, I just feel out of place because I am not used to feeling comfortable around people anymore. I just feel exhausted and dumbed down to only focus on how to pay my bills. I don't know how to motivate myself to do things and regain that youthful curiousness, I don't even know what things would make me happy anymore. But I know that I hate the way things are now.

64,"This is just something I noticed and wanted to point out. 

We have all heard the cliche sayings, such as ""never judge a book by its cover"", to explain that people aren't always what they seem. But it is usually applied in such a way that we shouldn't judge somebody in a negative light based on a few factors. 

But the opposite holds just as much weight. Those who seem happy, levelheaded and successful may be fighting a battle greater than most could imagine. 

This was brought to my attention when my boss at work mentioned to my friend and I that it's clear neither of us have any ""baggage"". She said ""You're 22. What could have possibly happened to you to cause any emotional baggage? There's no way."" Mentally, I started listing thing after thing after thing. Sexual abuse, emotional abuse, mental health struggles, suicide attempts, etc. 

Essentially, I suppose it is somewhat of a compliment to know that I can hide those pieces of my life from the outside world when I want to. But at the same time, I felt jibbed. These are my battle scars. I have been through hell and back to mold myself into the person I am, and continue to become. To be written off because of my age seemed unjust. This ""emotional baggage"" isn't just a negative hurdle people in life are forced to cross. It's experience that has given me insight into the world that others might not have. It's wisdom, strength, and endurance. 

I felt, possibly, that others who are fighting this invisible battle with life and mental illness would be able to relate to this lack of validation from the outside world. ",10Jul2017,8
65,"Recently I've noticed strange moving spider-like hallucinations in complete darkness whilst in bed. At first, I freaked out a little as I thought they were real but realized that they're not.

Even now that I expect it, they can be convincing enough to give me doubts whether or not they are actually there. They are like clusters of darkness with a defined torso and legs that crawl up and down the wall and bed. It's not as clear like seeing a spider in reality but could be confused with a real one in darkness.

67,"I was always a fast paced kind of guy. I called myself a mover and shaker, someone who goes balls deep in every form of pushing myself (aside from physically, I love being slightly overweight). I was diagnosed with ADD when I was very young, and have always seen my rapid thinking as a strength, more than a debilitant. I have a decently high IQ, so I always assumed I would figure my shit out and make a big impact on our world.

In the past 8 years though, I've failed to acquire my driver's license repeatedly, I've lost more jobs than I can count (although my current employment is pretty fruitful[almost 3 years!]), I failed to finish school (in part due to finances, but I was half-assing it anyways), I've had 3 bands fail, I've never been able to actually even record a single album, I've had nothing but dangerously co-dependent relationships which end in me being cheated on or abandoned, I've planned my own suicide at least 3 times (excluding all of the times I've pulled blades away from my arms and neck during freakouts), went too far and attempted during a fit of rage, and now am having weekly anxiety attacks, lasting bouts of depression, fits of explosive rage, sleep problems, near constant suicidal ideation, panic attacks, periods of ""spacing out"" and becoming more or less despondent, sudden mood changes, general irritability, anti-social tendencies and more shit.

I used to be so happy, am I just a late bloomer for severe depression? Is this just part of life? Is my ADD becoming something worse?

I don't want to die. I don't want to think about dying. All the time though my every urge tells me I deserve to. I've never done anything worth-while, anything worth noting. I hate who I've become, I hate how old I'm getting. I hate my race, resent myself for my sexuality, and worry I'm not smart enough to decide what my faith is.

68,"So I have been with my job now for about 4.5 months. It is a job in my field, pays very well with benefits for an underpaid field, my voice is more valued in this position, and I relocated to a beautiful part of the united states that is one of ""the best places to live"". On paper everything is amazing and everyone is super proud of me. 

But then my depression and anxiety kicked it into high gear about two months ago. It is something that I have struggled with my entire life but every now and again I get a really bad flare up and have been hospitalized in the past. I immediately reached out to my PCP and got back on meds (which I probably should have been taking all the while). I am also trying to sort out a therapist but many in this area aren't taking new clients. Also while I am doing my best to love my job, it isn't everything that I would hoped that it would be: it is way more formal and the work that we are producing is mediocre in the broad spectrum of what is happening in the field.

Back to the job: About a month ago, I really got slammed with a bunch of projects. To be honest I probably should have said no somewhere along the way. But I didn't and now I am behind on multiple projects. I made a brief mention with my boss in one of our one-on-ones that I was going to be starting a new medication and may be dealing with some side effects. What I didn't mentioned was that I dealing with a well-documented illness and that I may need additional support. Now everything is due and nothing is done because I keep making the decision to tackle low-stress low-urgency projects instead of the more pressing tasks. 

Now I am terrified of my next one-on-one tomorrow. I haven't gotten out of bed all day and feel disgusting and ashamed. I can't tell if I am miserable at work because of the environment or if it is my stupid brain that doesn't process emotions correctly. 

* Has anyone dealt with ""coming out"" to their job about their mental illness?
* Does anyone have recommendations for dealing with late work?
* What are people's on-the-job coping skills?

TL;DR: I have hidden my mental illness and it has impacted my work and now I have to confront it with my boss.",10Jul2017,3
