0,"These last few years I've noticed that, especially online, people are talking much more openly about having anxiety. That's great. But I've also noticed that suddenly everything is anxiety. If you feel socially awkward, it must be social anxiety. If some girl was crying on the phone, she must have been having a panic attack. If you feel nervous when doing a presentation in class, it must be anxiety. A lot of these people may very well be officially diagnosed with anxiety, but I've followed discussion threads etc. several times where it turned out the person was ""self-diagnosed.""


Don't self-diagnose. 
For every person who's diagnosed themselves, ten officially diagnosed people lose their credibility to the rest of the world. Well, not exactly, of course, but you get what I'm saying. 
Being concerned about a possible diagnosis is completely fine, but unless you seek professional help and get treated, you're going to seem like an attention whore who sees mental illness as an edgy accessory. At least to me. And as someone who's struggled with some severe issues for over ten years, I don't need a bunch of tumblr-teenagers who deal with regular teen-issues to label themselves with diagnoses of anxiety or other illnesses and proclaim it left and right.
Okay, that was a bit harsh.


I'm aware that society today is becoming more and more demanding of the individual. There is a growing mentality, that if you struggle in life, with your job or whatever, you need to look inwards and find out what's wrong with YOU that you can fix. I personally hate that sentiment, and I think that there definitely are tendencies in (western) society that cause a lot of people to be stressed and anxious in the medical sense, more so than in the old days. At the same time we are more aware of mental health today than ever, so more people will be diagnosed, who would previously have had a much sadder fate.


I just don't think that anyone gains anything by people being overly dramatic. It's okay to be socially awkward, you're human. It doesn't need a fancy name and seem like a handicap. It's okay to break down in tears when things in life are shitty. That's not a panick attack, that's a normal emotional response.
Again, **I'm only talking about those who self-diagnose** and throw serious labels left and right when humans are acting in ordinary human ways.


I honestly think this is some sort of backlash from those years (i want to say mid 90s to 2005-10-ish specifically, but I don't even know, it's 2 AM here) where there was a more pronounced pressure to be perfect in every way. People aren't perfect, but instead of finding peace in that, the new trend has become to put a medical label on it, because then it's valid. It's not as valid that you're just not the type of person to work a full time job and still work out every day.
But it is valid, of course.


Basically, I think a lot of people seem to see anxiety as an acceptable reason to not be perfect, when instead they would be much happier if they accepted their humanity and limitations. At the same time it reflects badly on mental health issues to use anxiety that way.


Am I being a bitch for thinking like this? Are people not actually talking much about anxiety, is it just in my head?
I would love to have this discussion, maybe someone can change my mind completely. 
Or maybe I'll delete this when I wake up tomorrow because it's a product of my ""I should've been sleeping 4 hours ago""-brain.",31Aug2017,8
1,"Im diagnosed with bipolar mania. I recently got off dope and also dealing with a breakup, job loss, loss of friends and respect and having to move back with my parents at 31. I threw my life away. I spent the last year doing nothing but getting high with other fuckups, because I was out of normal society for so long, I wasn't able to function when I tried to go back right after stopping drugs. I was once funny and made friends easily, now I'm extremely paranoid and because of my low self esteem, my mind tells myself ""you're a 31 year old junkie loser who has nothing now. Your not a man, you are worthless."". I'm constantly trembling, shaky, anxious and so uncomfortable in my own skin. I can't even go get a haircut bcus I'm so messed up, I couldn't hold a conversation with the barber who knows me well, I was acting weird and looking around. My eyes feel
Heavy, I feel like I'm numb, I just sit around in a fog thinking of nothing but anxiety. This was never this serious. I feel like I'm too far gone. I can't do this anymore. At my age, nobody cares, my parents are old and miserable with problems of their own. 

Everywhere I go, I think ppl are closely watching me, watching my movements, if I'm walking funny, if I look crazy, I think people are laughing at me and my life, I think the whole world sees me as inferior... I feel inferior. I've never dealt with paranoia this bad. I used to be engaged, traveled the world and have a pretty good job...I was witty but caring , and always tried to make ppl who looked uncomfortable , comfortable , because I know how it feels to deal with Anxiety. Now I can't even help myself...I won't even leave my house now. I think I can see myself from outside my body when I talk and it makes social interaction very awkward(not holding eye contact, trembling, loss of words)

This is my situation. I'm not functioning at all.",31Aug2017,2

6,"It goes for movies and shows too. My case is just youtube. I'd watch a video I like and rewind the funny/ enjoyable parts of it a million times. I'd watch it so much that the clip isn't funny anymore. But I'll keep rewinding the same few seconds of a video. Once I can move on, I'll do it with another clip. and often I'll just start the whole video over and repeat the nasty cycle. Getting stuck at the same clips. It takes me forever to watch even a 15 minute video. It'll take more than double the actual time. I don't think I can help it. Or its hard anyway. 

Anyone else do the same or similar? How do you deal with it?",31Aug2017,7
7,"I'm not sure many people will ever read this, but life is short (sometimes) so what the hell , here goes. Like a diary entry one might stumble upon.

Prepare for a pity party but this is where im at mentally, truthfully, and have turned to the interweb because maybe out there somewhere I'll find some hopeful word, and reddit has made me laugh and feel connected to people, when I'm otherwise isolated :

I feel like I'm just waiting to die. Let me make it clear: I would never EVER end my own life- I made a firm decision awhile ago that when I die is up to God/the Universe/whatever title for that higher power out there. No matter how bad things are, it's up to Him/Her/It. But the daily pain and loneliness that consumes me a majority of the time, feels never-ending.

And here is why, it starts with this: my mom died when I was 12. My first 11 1/2 years of life were bliss, pure heaven. Then in the span of 2 months she was diagnosed with cancer and was gone. It's hard to explain to anyone just how much, but she was an amazing person beyond words. My best friend. I haven't moved on and never will. Yes I'm in therapy. Yes I'm on medication. Yes ive gone to rehab and stopped drinking or using after no pill or drink or drug would numb anymore and my health was in danger. Yes ive tried AA and NA meetings and worked all the steps the best I could many a time with many a sponsor and many a surrenders etc. To the best of my ability. Yes i pray. Constantly. Asking only for God's will in my life and the power to carry it out. For God to help me fulfill His/Her/It/etc 's purpose for me in this life. Yes i meditate. Yes ive been to synagogue. And church. Yes I've tried greif groups and counseling and eating disorder rehab and drug rehabs etc etc etc. Trust me ive tried it all. And heard a lot of different feedback from many a therapist and counselor and sponsor and what-have-you.


But I feel like living without my Mom here, really here, is a lifelong sentence of imprisonment from happiness that I have to face every day until finally I can RIP and not have to carry this deep down soul pain any longer, that no therapy session or pill or rehab or any other ""mental health support"" or person or thing can change. Reality is she's gone and never coming back.  

When it comes to other people in my life...my dad and I are very different, he's not very emotionally in tune and not at all spiritual or emotional or artistic like i tend to be, moreso. And he has moved on and remarried. My brother was 18 when my mom died and managed to graduate ivy league is making tons of money married with a child and a second on the way. Building a mansion on the beach in Florida, no joke. He and I are polar opposites. Everyone else in my family has moved on. They have their lives. I used drugs for a long time and have stopped , but I caused family a lot of pain and sorrow and was just a burden for awhile, still am most likely. I'm a constant worry for them ""will she lose her grip again?"" I've caused them burden and fear and sadness. That they'll probably always carry now, always wondering if I'll plunge off the deep end. What a great asset I am!(sarcasm).


There's not a single woman figure in my life either to guide me. No close female friend or female figure to look up to.

 After my mom died my brother peaced out geographically, my dad checked out mentally,  and there was no one around for awhile. My dad worked and was gone most of the time and I was pretty much alone in a house making my own food etc etc doing the housework fending for myself in an empty house . No lie. I'd bus to school and home. Sometimes a friend from school would come over. But I was pretty much just dwelling alone in a house that once was a home.

And that's sort of how I've been since. Literally and figuratively. Inside and out.

 I wonder why my mom and dad couldn't have just had my brother. Why I had to come along too, if I was to be sentenced to a life of loneliness wherein no matter who I'm surrounded by this hole where my mom should be in my life, forever remains. 

Again: ill keep on trucking. No matter what im here til God decides my time has come to go. But I see no purpose in being here. I know my family would be sad if I was gone, despite all the sorrow I've caused them . But they'd be okay they have people they connect with and they have their lives to live. They'd no longer have to worry about me.
I have nobody. I have acquaintances.  I have an ex who I talk with and we are friends but at a distance as that brings baggage. The old friends i used to have have drifted away and moved on and married etc. Especially as i was in and out of rehabs and running amuck. 

My cat is my only other friend. I'm serious. She's pretty awesome, actually. The bright spot in my life.

But as I said, my family and I are different people operating on different levels completely. And I'm on my own. And a large part of me has been alone for so long that I've pretty much shut myself off from the world and all others in it. I've caged myself in and built a wall which you can't cross. And it's become comfortable that way, so in a sense I've made my bed and it's mine to sleep in. It's how it is. I can't seem to escape my own trap that once was safety and now is suffocating. 

------

I have prayed and prayed and begged God/a Higher Power to help me find my reason for being here or else please let me RIP with Him/Her/It. 

On top of it all when it comes to finding someone to be with- a life partner- I've come to realize that I'm into girls not guys and my family would freak if they ever knew I'm not straight. They'd be devastated.  And I don't know how to meet girls and I have a specific ""type"" that just seems unrealistic and unlikely to find. Its a recent reality that ive come to realize because i used to reject my truth as just me wanting a woman in my life since i didnt have a mom. But my therapist gave me the insight that we are born the way we are and trauma doesnt determine a persons sexuality. Believe what you want to believe - point us, I'm not straight. But I dont see myself being able to put myself out there or find the type of girl im attracted to -Super girly, feminine - like me. All the girls ive ever found attractive are straight and often have boyfriends! I told my best friend in high school I had feelings for her and that did not bode well. I'm probably selling myself short. But it's just too rough for me to try and tackle yet another confusion and I especially with the family rejection and disappointment- if I did find someone and they were to know - on top of what I've already out them through...and if I were to just keep it a secret ...ive had enough with the lies and deception it takes a toll when you've done it for years due to drugs mental illness and other problems. So a future in the whole romance department seems bleak both because of my own issues and my family's views.

And to be honest, I'm too afraid to try and reach out to anybody or make new friends now that I'm in my 20's. I feel like my depression and loneliness is contagious and no one wants to be around that. Even if that's only my perception, not reality, years of rehab and ""issues"" have left me without a friend group and feeling socially awkward and inept due to so much time in isolation from true connection.

I know there's a lot in my life I should be grateful for. So many peopke have it so,so much worse. At leadt i have family! I have a roof over my head! Food on my plate! Relatively good physical health (emphasis on the physical, rather than mental). All this in itself fuels the guilt I have for feeling the way I feel: Like I'm just waiting to die. 

 I've been miserable since age 11 and it's getting really old. 

Even when I try to pick up my guitar and make music again - that used to be the one thing I could say ""okay at least I have this"". Never shared it with anyone, give or take a couple of people, because im not very good at it, but I had it to keep me going and it was a therapy and made me feel worth something. I can't find any chords to strum or lyrics to write or tunes to sing anymore. The sounds of silence fill me when I hold my guitar. Just, nothing comes to me. At all. It's like I've lost that one last thing I clinged to as who I was and what made me feel like I have worth. My music was when I felt connected to a higher power, when I felt my soul awaken, my spirit light up again, life force. And that's just, gone, somehow.

Anyway, that's it. Just spilled out some real feelings and thoughts onto this blank virtual page. 

Late night musings. 

If you find this, and actually read it, well - thank you! I feel like I should've just gone and written this in a journal somewhere , but it's all typed out here now and it's 1:15am so I'm gonna hit the submit button and listen to a guided sleep meditation so my brain shuts up for awhile. 

Here goes nothing...

Sincerely,
Me.",31Aug2017,2

9,"I'm a 22-year-old male living in the US. I have had issues with feeling depressed (I won't call it depression because it was undiagnosed) starting in my early teen years, peaking around 17-19. It came in periods of days (rarely), weeks (usually) and months (occasionally). Otherwise I'm generally a normal intelligent introvert, I don't maintain a lot of friendships but the ones I have last a long time. I've been in a relationship for a year, and it has been the best year of my life. When we met I was in one of my blue periods and she snapped me out of it, and I've been good since. We lived together for most of our relationship, and recently became long distance (~4 hours) because I graduated from the university she still attends.  
I recently started a pretty stressful academic endeavor and I've been feeling good and prepared and not really stressing about it but tonight I think some stress I hadn't realized I was feeling, combined with some anger and frustration at my girlfriend for going out tonight unexpectedly when she and I have plans tomorrow night to do the same when I'm driving up to see her and I was fixated in the idea that she wouldn't want to do that with me tomorrow night since she just did it tonight. This spiraled into darker and darker thoughts and increasing anger and frustration which wasn't helped by her very sporadic responses to my pleas for reassurance and calming words. Eventually I couldn't stand it anymore, I threatened not to come see her, and grabbed my pocket knife and did something I promised her I'd never do again. I cut myself, like I used to off and on for years (it's superficial, mostly just so I can see the cut and feel it but not intended to do any real damage, on my left side along my ribs where my scars are). I immediately felt the anger slip away as I realized what I'd done and that she's going to be very upset with me when she finds out, which she will one way or another when I visit. I immediately apologized and cried on my bed for a few minutes and now I'm waiting for her to get home from the bar, at which point she'll call me to talk. I'm going to tell her what I did and that I'm not going to do it again, but I really don't know what it was that drove me into that spiral and overall episode.  
I'm mostly writing this to talk through it with myself and understand it. If anyone sees this and has any comments that's cool, but if not that's cool too.",31Aug2017,1

14,"So, a few months ago I went to go get evaluated for depression. They asked me questions; had I been sleeping enough, eating enough (both no, I’m 16 and get 3-4 hours a night, 6 ft. and I weighed 118 lbs). When I was done they didn’t really give me a clear answer so I went home still not completely at peace with what was wrong with me. Until yesterday. 

I know self diagnosing is frowned upon, but when no one is really helping with finding you an answer it’s all you can do. There’s this thing called [Avoidant Personality Disorder ](https://psychcentral.com/disorders/avoidant-personality-disorder-symptoms/). I went through the symptoms and traits, and everything sounds exactly like what I’ve been dealing with for years, and it turns out that depression is just one of the symptoms. I hate socializing with people, even my own family. I stay locked away in my room the majority of every day. My self esteem has been horribly low since I was in middle school; I feel like everything is my fault even when people say I haven’t done anything wrong. I’m overall really socially inept. I feel like I should go back to the psychiatrist to get properly diagnosed but I feel like it’ll just be a waste of time again. 

Any advice would be appreciated because I’m tired of feeling lost and not knowing what’s going on with me. Many people will probably say “You’re just a teenager experiencing life! Get over it!” Trust me, if it was that, I wouldn’t be on here. If it were “just hormones” I would know. I’m not one of those teens who thinks the entire world is against them. 

I don’t know if anyone will read this entire thing but if anyone does, thank you so very much for listening. ",31Aug2017,1
15,"**tldr;** 

For the past 6 years (since I was 19), I have been living alone and in a different country to work. During this time, particularly in the past 2 years, my mental health has suffered. Last year, I was diagnosed with severe major depression and GAD. 

Last year, I also decided to return to college and get my degree. I'm now 25 and about to go into my second year of a 3-year course. However, I'm thinking of moving home to be with my family and find my feet again. I don't really have a support network (besides my family who live in my home country), and I think I really need one. 

Unfortunately, the colleges in my home country do not allow for transfers so I would have to repeat year one of my degree. 

Either I carry on in my current situation (living alone, no support network, but only 2 years until graduation) OR I move home, live with my family but I won't graduate until I'm 27. Despite how much I have suffered living alone... I feel that I'm also aware of being the ""old"" person in the classroom. ",31Aug2017,1
16,"Mental health has two aspects that are generally one. Being healthy individual means you have no mental health issues. Living a healthy lifestyle encourages this. The second aspect is, some people have Actual problems that need therapy/medication.

Are you getting my point here? Healthy lifestyle is a relative term, that means ensuring the person has a happy life. If this means medication so be it. If this means meditation yes, or exercise, or cold shock therapy.


So how many of you are using any of the following (scientifically proven, and most of them very popular) methods to ensure you have a better tomorrow:

Meditation
Wim hof method or other breathing exercises
Saunas
Regular exercise
Low sugary diet (or maybe ketogenic diet)
Proper sleep
Hydration
Nutritient and adaptogens
Fasting and intermittent fasting

These are physical activities, that helped me get through drug related mental health issues.

A week ago, I posted about going inpatient and how long it was taking.  I thought it was an ill omen of my stay.  It really wasn't.  I had a great time, as much as you can being inpatient in a psych hospital. If you're in the Dallas-ft Worth area, I recommend going to Carrolton Springs.

First the people there were either there for depression/anxiety or substance abuse.  I made a lot of inpatient friends, and we helped each other out with our issues.  You get to go outside four times a day.   Staff was relatively nice and friendly,  as long as you go to groups.  Speaking of,  you had options of what groups to go to.  There's even a faith based curriculum,  which I participated in.  It made me find faith again.  Also they have pet therapy. 

My psychiatrist was very good, but heard rumbles about the medical doctor.

Overall, one of the best hospital stays and I feel refreshed and so much better, and confident in my abilities to cope. I also figured out my goal in life- I'm going to grad school to get my PhD.

20,"Almost every day, often when I go to sleep or when I wake up at night I get these flashbacks of memories of stupid stuff I have made before. Usually, it is about stuff I said (lying or saying stupid stuff to someone) or did (using drugs and interacted with sober people) that probably no one else even remembers if they did it is probably just really vaguely.

These flashbacks are coming more often lately. And they give me these really anxious feelings, and also they also give me these really stupid tics (like breathing out heavily, blinking really fast etc) when they come up. 

I really don't know what to do to make them go away. When I talk to someone else about it they just shrug and think it's not that bad. What has happened has happened. 

But for me, they make me really depressed, anxious and make me feel tired. I did meet a therapist for a few occasions. It made these feelings and flashbacks go away, but only for a while. But they keep coming back.

I really don't know what I should think about this, if these flashbacks (memories) will go away in time or if they will make me feel worse.

21,"When I say I have generalized anxiety disorder, I feel the need to justify myself. As if this anxiety isn't enough to make me physically ill. Sure, add depression to that too. These two illnesses together are dynamite. Days where they double team me are days that I'd feel better dead. I've been on a few different medications, and I'm still physically unable to get out of bed most days. My family and I had finally decided to put me on full homebound. My doctor and my therapist signed the forms without a second thought, the school did not. They said they needed a return date for anything to happen. A return date. We have no clue when I will return, and since it's for something like the heavily stigmatized illness of anxiety, they don't accept that. My anxiety and depression do not have an end date. A day that I will magically get out of bed &amp; be ready to go to school. And if that day comes, I will openly be lonely. My anxiety shares a bed with me, shares my body and shares everything else that is mine. They are an unwanted guest but I can't put them in a guest room. depression cuddles with anxiety in front of me to make me feel even more alone even when my bed is taken up by these thoughts. I do have good days. Days that aren't ruined by migraines or a panic attack that I always think is a heart attack. There are days I can get out of bed, shower and brush my hair. See, doing things like that is a luxury I cannot afford everyday. I lose track of time while knowing to the second what time it is. Taking care of my body is an afterthought to me. These good days are amazing, euphoric even. Yesterday was a great day. I spent time with my mom, I spent time with my brother and his girlfriend. I went to McDonald's at 9 with two dogs in the car and three people. I was face timing my brother who I haven't seen in months, planning to go see him in a couple months. But while all of this is happening, I know bad days will follow. Good days are worth my bad days. I know when I fly to see him there will be nights I can't sleep anywhere but my bathroom floor. I know this. Yesterday was a great day. Today, I woke up at 4am having a panic attack that caused me to once again google the difference between a panic attack and a heart attack. I know my body at this point. One good day equals 1 really bad one and a couple bad days. So many thoughts run through my head per minute that I stumble when I speak, I stumble when I walk, I stumble over everything because nothing ever has my undivided attention. My mind is split sixty forty. When I sleep or when I'm awake. My dreams are nightmares of having no control, of not ever being good enough. There is no safe spot in my head, and no return date. I cannot predict anymore than I will have good days and bad days, and those bad days I cannot handle even after dealing with them for 15 years. I am fragile, but I am not broken. ",31Aug2017,1
22,"Hey !

I'm a 24 years old male.

It's extremely hard to do anything for me, and It wasn't like that before.

I have no motivation to even get out of bed, and if not for work and my obligations I would not even bother getting up. I don't even want to eat and when I'm awake I don't want to go to sleep because I feel like I'm wasting time, but when I am asleep I don't want to wake up.

I don't feel anything (except from anger, rage, and I'm constantly feeling sad), even if I try really hard. I still think about consequences and try to base my opinion on that, but I just accept everything, it honestly feels like I'm watching a movie or something.

I really don't know how to describe it but, it feels like I'm constantly out of energy, it's getting worse with each day. I feel like nothing I do matters, that my and my family's life is going nowhere. I feel broken and I don't know how to combat this. I have a lot of issues in life and people depend on me and I'm thinking about all of this each day, I can't run away from these thoughts, it honestly feels like I'm going insane. I can't focus on anything for more than five minutes because my mind wonders somewhere, I'm thinking about a different life, and some times it can take hours for me to realize that I had to do something, I'm trying to control this but I can't, it just happens, it's like an autopilot.

Few weeks ago my sister tried to commit suicide and this destoyed me, I wan't to push forward do something that would help right now, but I can't do shit, even If I want to I can't, it feels like something is holding me back, even simple things are sometimes impossible for me.

33,"I just had the most intense experience of my life…I think.   So let me back pedal. I've been going to therapy once a week for the last month and a half.  Anxiety, panic attacks, a general lack of joy in life. I have been making a lot of progress in my personal life.  I've been more patient with my children I’ve been more loving to my wife. I have definitely been more into my job as of late as well.  Things were looking up but I was getting the feeling there was a ‘road block”.  I didn’t know what it was. I had been trying to work it out but none of the pieces fit.

So I’ve been having issues allowing my self to be happy.  In my head, there was always something that wouldn’t allow it.  I couldn’t enjoy dinners out with my family because somewhere out there people were hungry.  I couldn’t buy myself new shoes because someone might compliment them and that would make me feel weird. Plus they might be small talk about where I bought them, which would remind me I spent money on myself and I'd feel like shit.   I couldn’t buy myself new jeans that fit (recently lost some decent weight) because the wasn’t organized properly so I couldn’t find my size.  After trying a few different pairs, my anxiety flared up and I have to leave immediately.   I've never been able to wear pants that actually fit the way they were supposed to because I was bigger.  I was looking forward to having pants that actually fit and being happy about my weight loss. It was like my body wouldn’t allow me to enjoy it if that makes sense. I have countless examples of situations similar to this. 

Yesterday my wife and I had sex.  She started off with a pretty amazing blowjob.  I enjoyed it.  It made me happy.  So all day today I was thinking about that.  It kind of blew me away.   I bring it up with my wife and she says “well, let me do it again”  So tonight, after the kids were in bed,  I sat down in a chair and she began.  I was enjoying it but I could feel that “road block”.   I was watching her and was super into it.  Pushing up against that road block.  This went on for a long time. Then she stopped and said “I want to enjoy this and cum naturally”  It was like a switch was flipped.  It started as waves.  Electricity.  Pulses.  I just let it hit me.  For what seemed like an entering, I had the most intense body orgasm that keeps hitting me, over and over.  She kept working me in sync with the bodies natural highs and lows until it stopped. We then proceeded to have very intense, passionate sex. I was behind her against the wall as I came. It wouldn’t stop.  That same wave type orgasm couple with ejaculation this time left me standing there propped one hand on the wall for a long time just shaking.  I felt…lighter.  Then This rush of emotion hit me like a truck. Memories sort of.  Or rather memories of feelings.  I looked at my wife and my eyes started to tear up.  I quickly brushed those feelings away.  

We went into our bathroom and were talking about it all. I started to get that same feeling again.  This time I couldn’t contain it. I cried hard into my wife's chest as she stood in front of me.  I sat there for a long time after, shocked or something similar. I picture was forming in my head. Childhood, Adolescence, Adulthood.  Past relationships that were ruined, personal hang ups, the relationship I have with my wife.  Everything was tracing backward, like a path I had walked, toward a gray stop in my past.  I can’t see it but I can feel it.  It feels bad.  Painful. 

My thought is this.  I thinking something happened when I was a kid.  Molestation stuff.  Now Idea who.  But there this feeling that whatever was done, I was told it was bad. It was very bad and I shouldn’t tell anyone.  So I didn’t. And then every sexual encounter I had up until this point was affected by it. There was always this guilt behind me saying what I was doing was wrong but sexual desire would win out most of the time.  After I was done I’d have this sense of what I had just done was dirty, or that I was dirty.  So I’d get up and out of the situation. I wouldn’t allow myself to feel happy because sex was bad.  

Now what I'm thinking is that the feeling of happiness then morphed into an eject button.  Sex is bad. Sex can make me happy. Happiness is bad.  That then started to permeate my everyday life.  Small at first but then leading to the panic attacks I had been having due to or related to my personal happiness. I know people use this phrase a lot, but it was mind blowing.  

As I was explaining all of this to my wife, I felt free. Like, that roadblock was gone and an enormous weight had been lifted off my chest.  I felt happy.  Like deep happiness. It was sort of foreign at first but I felt it growing. As I'm typing this, a good 2 hours later, I still feel it. Healing maybe. I don't know. I'm not a doctor. 

Tl;dr  I got a blowjob from my wife that made me cum so hard I realized I had most likely been molested as a child.

34,"how do you get diagnosed with PTSD? i get really bad and sometimes vivid flashbacks and nightmares sometimes about this event. the flash backs get triggered SO easily and i don't know how to stop them. i get scared to close my eyes sometimes because i'll see it. i avoid anything that even remotely reminds me of it. when i get the flashbacks, it triggers a depression episode and i just start to feel emotionally numb. it's exhausting. anyone relate??

36,I forget things way too easily that are short term and it winds up biting me in the rear end. Also I find myself struggling to detect or pick up on things as quickly as others can sometimes. Is this just a sign of fatigue? I mean I barely get any sleep everyday and I work 8-9 hours a day. I really do blame it on my sleeping habits and hopefully that is the case here. It's an ongoing pattern that I have dealt with for a while. I sometimes go to work on 4-6 hours of sleep and I'm 23. It sure doesn't seem right,31Aug2017,1

39,"Our relationship has been in an unhealthy way for the best of 2 years. I've finished counseling with her whilst we had a very ""close"" emotional bond. (Her words not mine). I've been obsessed with her for the past 3 months. Every time I feel I'm over her and my infatuation for her she texts me and reminds me she exists.

Her texts are very friendly. She asks how I am doing etc. I was so desperate to keep in contact when she asked if I wanted to I said yes. But my life has reverted into waiting for her to text me and then feeling extremely heart broken and depressed afterwards. By the time I've gotten over the previous text she texts me again a couple of weeks/months later. After I get a taste of her attention she then goes away for weeks at a time, leaving me feeling abandoned, alone and heart broken.

I feel like she has me on a line and every time I get over her and my infatuation she reels me back in. She was very off with me when I text her about our relationship and told me it was all just counselling, despite many times where we've not done counseling but talked/socialized outside of just counseling. 

I feel angry, I feel upset, depressed and hurt. Most importantly I feel heart broken. I never dated this woman, I just got too emotionally close. I got a text today and felt depressed not because I hate her, but because I was finally getting over her and she pulls me back in.",31Aug2017,1
40,"I believe a source of my anxiety is that I fill my day with shit just to do it.  Are there online resources that can help me figure out what I like doing?

41,"To be honest, I've been struggling for so long with absolutely no one for support as I'm that awkward person who never shares anything(never cried in front of one person in my whole life). This isn't an attention post I just feel like I need to get this out here. So I feel like if I kill myself, people would realise how bad I am. I probably haven't worded that right haha. But honestly before you tell me to tell someone I physically cant. My mum doesn't really believe in mental illnesses (not sure why hmm) I'm still at school(over 16) and multiple times I have actually tried telling the school counsellors and they laugh and tell me it will pass soon!! The school nurse never got back in touch. I am actually so sick of this so I really do feel like if I just killed myself it would all be over and I wouldn't have to worry about this ever again.",31Aug2017,1
