0,"Hey guys, mental health sufferer since my teens here. I'm currently on citalopram for medication and my disorder(s) are pretty much under control for the time being. I still have a depressive lifestyle (bored, no passion, no hygeine, alcohol misuse etc.) but I wanted to get your opinions on a brief phase I have gone through twice in my mid-teens. My symptoms were extremely frightening and I have never experienced such anxiety nor a feeling of lack of control and impending doom quite like it since.

General gist of what I felt like: It started with depression. That type of deep depression you get where it feels as if you will never get better and you physically hurt because of it. This was accompanied by the anxiety of something going wrong with my body, that I was dying or something. This sounds like a panic attack, but it lasted for at least four days. I then turned from depressed to manic, to delusional and hypersensitive to noise. My ability to fall asleep was non-existant and time seemed to go extremely quickly. I would be in bed and try desperatly to sleep and then the next thing I knew, it would be 5 a.m in 5 minutes. Which only added to my intense anxiety and loss of reality. When I did sleep, I awoke with high-energy and had an obsession with checking the time. Once I slept for 5 hours which is normal for me now, but I looked at the clock and worked it out and cried because I thought I had had hardly any sleep. I never tired, I never felt sleepy for days. Next came the hallucinations. I saw people walking into rooms that weren't there, I saw my fingers growing while I was in the bathtub and voices I heard on the TV sounded warped and had imaginary accents. Now, I have suffered panic attacks before, but none that lasted days. I am diagnosed with clinical depression but this experience I had scared me so much. I am so worried it will happen again.",16Sep2017,1,
1,"I am a 30 year old male living in the US. High school degree working at a medical practice in a relatively low skill job there for the past several years, but wish to do more with my life. I have been dating my significant other for almost 3 years. I have no history with any mental health professionals.  I have trouble at times with extreme criticisms of people. Instant judgements where I am rationalizing that I am a better person than them.  Although I do not vocalize these and am often criticized for being the quiet one in the group.  I have very high stress levels sometimes regarding my SO's finances and sometimes lash out at her as a result.  I have grown up with a financial support system of means which I do not want to discuss; however she does not have this and is in pretty severe debt. My father commited suicide when I was very young and I have felt it increasingly hard recently to deal with personal relationships.  I am scared to seek mental help but feel like I should. I am scared that I might have a mental illness I might not be fully aware of.  But would probably feel relieved if diagnosed. Should I seek help? ",16Sep2017,1,

3,"Honestly, I don't even know where to start. I think I'm mostly here to vent but also to hear someone else say they know what I'm going through so I don't feel alone...

To get straight to the point: my parents (especially mom) don't want me to go anywhere because they're scared of something happening to me. My parents claim it's because they believe that I'm so innocent and pure and have never been ""roughed up"" as a child. This is mainly due to the fact that my older brother was a thug when he was younger and always got in trouble. However, me, I'm the total opposite (as far as my parents know). I get good grades and Im quiet and I like to be alone a lot. As a result, this has lead to people labeling me as an innocent quiet boy who has never experienced anything.

Truth is that I've been through more than any 17 year old boy deserves to go through. I hate to even talk about it, but I used to be molested when I was around 7. I was also molested by another man when I was 8 or 9. I was raped in 2016 and ever since 2015-ish, I've been extermely promiscuous trying to find some self esteem through having sex with other very old men (btw im gay). I've been jumped twice for looking like a ""faggot"". And yeah I smoke weed to cope with this.

As you'd imagine, it's kinda funny that I'm able to keep myself together even after having all these things happen to me. I also have absolutely no friends and have never told these things to anybody. My dad doesn't like me, my mom worries too much, and my brother and I are too different. I have nobody to talk to about this. And all my family lives in Mexico, so I'm kinda screwed.

I recently got my drivers license and a car and I've been exploring different places, trying to clear my head about life and start seeing nice things around me. But every time I go somewhere, my parents love to lecture me about how I can get ""taken advantage of"" by other people and how I can get killed or shot by people because I'm so ""innocent and naive and trustful"". I'm just so upset. I know that I've been through things my parents don't know about but still, I want to tell them just so they'll get off my back. But of course, I can never ever do that (at least not until I'm an adult). 

I'm applying to colleges right now and all I can fantasize about is going to a college far away from where I live, and even thinking about just abandoning my family because they will never understand who I am and always tell me who I should be. I know my mom and dad care about me and just want to protect me, but whats the point of living life if you're scared of everything. Life is so unpredictable and you can try to be careful, but people die everyday (yeah, I know very cynical). Part of me wants to just disappear so I never have to worry about irrelevant things like this. All I want is for my parents to just let me live my confusing life and not always try to tell me how I should be. I know my parents are so upset that their little Mexican son turned out to be such an friendless non-atheltic non-tough nerdy gay piece of shit.

Anyone have a similar story? Or advice? Words of wisdom? I'm just kind of desperate for human contact and comfort. Thanks!",16Sep2017,3,
4,"This is long i know, but if you skip over this then please dont bother answering this post.

I felt empty inside almost my whole life, i was never rich but i had enough to be spoiled so i cant get myself to appreciate things as much as i want to, and it also made me lazy. I get myself stuck in my comfort zone and my mind tries real hard to work against me when I try to do something about it. Lately If I want to apply to a job in person, I get zoned out in this weird feeling and i just start thinking ""nah they wont hire me, nah next time, nah ill apply online instead"", ive had this weird feeling for most my life so it really takes a toll on how successful i could be. Im a college freshman. Im too stubborn and broke to get help from a therapist.

It feels like my personality isnt normal either. In a way, i feel like expressions dont match up with what im trying to say to people, if that makes sense. It makes people misunderstand me or make me think im straight up weird, not sure. And at home, the family isnt really together or happy but i can deal with that, but its hard when family is the only thing you have. Right now i dont have friends and i feel like ive turned into a zombie or a robot because i dont talk or react as much as I use to, so my first semester so far hasnt beeb good for meeting people.

So even if i do start working, making money, and get out of my comfort zone, being a loner isnt me. I dont care much about money, i need to have a good time in the moment or at least have some people that can like me enough to hang.

All this and i feel empty and i literally go with the flow, so i spend most my time watching tv or on videogames, sometimes hindering my sleep or homework. I feel sad and like a walking robot with no goals or plans, yet id never bring myself to suicide. It feels like im trapped, and i cant exactly figure out why all of these things are happening in my head.",16Sep2017,5,
5,"Little back story. Approx 2 years ago my dad died. Seemingly since then, I have developed a very over active sense of existential crisis. I'm going to die, there's nothing I can do about it, etc

I wake up during the night panicking about my time and mode of death.

I think it's to do with the loss and the fact I can't speak to my dad again. Lost time, conversations we never had etc.

I am a sopohmore in high school who is taking rigorous classes. I am literally failing 6/7 classes right now. I procastinated so much my freshman year that I only got my work done at 4/5 am, even though I had to wake up at 6 am. I did this so much that I started sleeping all afternoom and staying up at night. Even though I did that I still managed to get all As since I am a pretty good test taker and always got my work done in the last mimute. This year this has changed, I just can not do work anymore. I still stay up all night, but I do nothing. I promise myself that I will get it done today, but I don't.
I am pretty sure that I have ADHD, I have almost all symptoms. I've tried tellIng my parents but they just don't take this stuff seriously. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to study physics in college, but if I continue doing what I am doing, I don't see how that will be possible. I don't know if I need prespriction drugs or something. It's 6 am, I stayed awake all night to do work, yet I did nothing again.
Sometimes when I discover something new and interesting I hyperfocus. I finished an online programming course that is supposed to last 6 months in a week. That's is literally all I did that week. After this hyperfocus thing, I loose interest. I have never programmed again (it's been 4 months since that). I did exactly same thing with astrophysics, electronics, philosophy, politics (yes, I spent two weeks only reading and watching videos about politics), tv shows, games... Everytime I only do one thing for a week then I loose interest and never do that again.

12,"First of all, please excuse any typos and other mechanicals; it's 4:00am out here and I'm tired from having to calm myself down. 

But for background, I live at home in Los Angeles, CA right now , I'm 22 y/o student/part time employee, male and for the longest, suffered from various symptoms of multiple mental illnesses, but was never formally diagnosed due to the combination of cost of doctor visits and cultural stigma (I'm black). The symptoms while uncomfortable, they rarely ever came as full fledged ""episodes"". At least to my knowledge. 

Fast forward to hours earlier, I was doing okay. I was messaging someone on Tinder, listening to music, lurking Reddit, just doing common chill stuff, relaxing alone. I can't pinpoint when everything shifted for me, but when it did, I had the sense that something was bad was about to happen. I feel that a lot, so I didn't pay much mind to it. A few minutes later it starts to increase and as I'm texting this person on Tinder, halfway through the message, I stopped. That feeling started feel more *loud*, but I still didn't pay it much mind. So as I'm listening to music, I play something a bit more slow to calm my nerves; it didn't and I kept replaying the same song over and over again trying to get a piece of mind while that feeling got louder. At this point my mind is racing, and I start to feel boxed by the loudness of my thoughts (for the lack of a better description). It was so much to the point I wanted to feel relief from that feeling, I started thinking about suicide in the way someone would think about taking a hot shower after a murky, humid day. Suddenly everything that's making noise, light, and/or moving is frustrating morbidly frustrating to me. Then I start to feel a little paranoid as if someone theirself wanted to murder me. I hear a faint noise (I assume it was the house settling in) and vocally ask ""what is that?"" At this point, everything was overwhelming Mr as I angrily slammed my MacBook screen, sat on the floor and started breathing heavier and subsequently started to cry. As tears were running down my face, I grabbed my phone that I put down earlier and started deactivating social media because I all of a sudden wanted to have nothing to do with my friends. After a while, I cried some more but eventually stopped and calmed myself down. 

So I'm posting this to ask, has anything similar happened to anyone else? What could've it been? I'm honestly a little scared and would just love for someone to talk to me about this. ",16Sep2017,3,

14,"I recently met this woman who I found very interesting and I had a romantic interest in her. She was very knowledgeable and I really liked her. I don't know if this is important context and I don't mean offense to this but she is an active feminist as well. I haven't had much dating experience because I've been in one serious relationship but I've also been very keen on psychology and neuroscience. I'm asking this question strictly from curiosity. 


Long story short, I don't want to outright say she was ""crazy"" because that word is very disrespectful, I know. She seemed to have some very deep hatred towards men and she would constantly go on about how men are predictable and she tried to play a power dynamic over me. Our time spent together was cut short because she had all of these insecurities and they got in the way of what we had. She was only using me as a place holder because she couldn't seem to get over her ex boyfriend. 


She relied on her mother HEAVILY both financially and emotionally. She claimed she was bisexual but she said she wasn't sexually attracted to women. We would talk about it and she said she's never had a girlfriend before but the sexual aspect just didn't appeal to her. 


She started to lead me on and treated me like I was her boyfriend but she would play that ""hot and cold"" game and I caught on. I was actually noticing her emotional abusive behavior towards me and I was genuinely confused and hurt. She toyed with my sexual ego and tried really hard to compare me to other men that she had been with. 


She then went down this dark path, telling me about her past and she never actually knew her actual father but thought that her mother's boyfriend at the time was her real father and didn't find that out until a later age. I can understand how that could totally mess with someone's head. 


She would tell me stories of ex boyfriends that she had in the past and how she actually physically abused one of them and sent him into a PTSD rage. This is where our relationship took a turn. I've also been so stunned that people like this could actually exist. She seemed to have some dark memories imbedded deep within her mind and she actually let it take control of her. 


I reached out her recently, just to be cordial and I asked she would like to catch a movie soon, just as friends. She denied the movie and went on about that new movie ""Mother"" and how she loved movies with strong, manipulative female roles. She would constantly go on about that when we were seeing each other, about how women play mind games and men are mentally inferior. 


She saw men as an opposition to women but at the same time, it seemed like she wanted a man emotionally. Can someone explain to me why something like this could occur to someone? ",16Sep2017,0,

2) Set a timer for 11 minutes with a soft and subtle alarm that wont shock you at the end.

3) Close your eyes and take five deep breaths. On the inhale, recite to yourself quietly in the mind 'inhale'. On the exhale, recite to yourself quietly in the mind 'exhale'. Now you're off and into the meditation. 

4) At times throughout, the mind will wander. Thats ok. Be effortless, let go of control. Don't hold onto any thoughts and just allow the mind to go wherever it chooses. Time will pass before you know it. 

5) When the alarm rings, take five deep breaths. Let the head drop so the eyes are facing into your lap and allow the eyes to open effortlessly as you let the world back in.

Words are hard, like strangely difficult considering that it’s the go-to method for all things communication.

Hi, I’m Teal, patron saint of turtles, and founder of Hip Healz. That thing wherein life royally screws you over happened to me last year. Basically, I took some new meds, and the meds thought I was a pretty lame guy so they hit me with a mental breakdown. This mental breakdown pulled out all the stops and even exposed an underlying mental illness. So I got a crash course in all of this crazy stuff so now I am here, giving you a strange lil’ bio about myself. 


Hey, I’m Morgan, Co-Owner of Hip Healz, and fervent advocator of sushi. I’ve pretty much been dealing with some form of mental illness my whole life. Because I never really talked about it, it pretty much exploded about two years ago, but that’s mostly managed now. I want to help people who were in my shoes by supporting and listening to them as best I can.


So we’ve both dealt with depression, mental illness, and just the day-to-day struggles of y’know being alive. Now, not to say our struggles are behind us, but rather we want to fight our struggles with a merry crew. 

*****

**Triage**: Hip Healz is organized by comfort levels. Immediately when you join you have to verify your account and then after that you are given access to *Blue.* Blue channel is our neutral zone, devoid of toxicity, but also not a safe space.  Then after that you can join Red, our safe haven for toxicity and passionate meming, or Yellow a safe environment we keep clean of scary invaders. If you are wary enough you might even catch a glimpse of our debate channel, the Grey Zone. 


**Verified Channels**: After you are verified you get access to our basic member channels, so support channels, venting channels, event channels, voice channels, and other cool jazz. 


**Events/Roles**: We plan to host regular events and have a variety of different roles to maintain our community all visible on our home page. 
I believe that mental health is a subject that deserves to be as broad and frequently discussed as politics, philosophy, and education. I also believe that mental health isn't just for people who have a mental illness, a disorder, a condition, or another diagnosable element. People who need support, regardless of the elements that brought them to needing that support, are welcome here. If you are a robot or a fish person you are also welcome. If you are a crab from an enemy faction other than that of Hip Healz’ native crab please consider the danger present to you.


**Whisper Channels**: Basically a channel to help anyone in need of support, whether it be for venting, companionship, advice, commiseration, or someone to talk to. The Whisper channel is a judgement-free zone, used solely to comfort those in need of help. Alternatively, all members are also welcome to support anyone who finds themselves in the Whisper channel.


**Roundtable**: The roundtable is the place for art, stories, poetry, cooking, music, or any other creative endeavours. Artistry is heavily encouraged in Hip Healz, and the creators who decide to volunteer in any fashion - artists making cool graphics, programmers designing bots, writers penning epic tales - gains the Creator tag.

24,"My brother is 28 and is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic with bi-polar disorder. He's on SSDI and has no job, no home, and no hope at this point. He is currently between places again as he has been evicted 3 times this year alone, but my mother has again taken him in. He's been like this on and off for over 10 years and has degraded to the point that he cannot take care of himself and is constantly putting himself in harms way.

A little over a year ago, my mother was able to get full, 100% guardianship over him, but even this has proved to be less than useful. We have been searching for a place for him to live/grow as he has no life skills. His hallucinations keep him from being able to be in any way social other than with other mentally-ill, drug addicts, or vagrants. He ALWAYS winds up losing or getting stolen/taken advantage of by everyone he meets. We want this vicious cycle to stop.

We have been searching for somewhere, anywhere in the US that would take him on an IN-voluntary basis because we cannot give him the help he needs. He has no life skills and refuses to medicate and things are spiraling out of control. I am willing to take him anywhere in the US if it meant he could live somewhere and begin learning how to live again even a sliver of life compared to what he is now. I fear if we don't get him some help soon he will eventually end up killed or kill himself. 

Any and all ideas are welcomed. Thank you.

26,"Hey! I want your input and thoughts!

&amp;nbsp;

I’m writing a screenplay (20-30 min in length, fiction). As an ex-EDNOS sufferer, I want to portray an eating disorder in a subjective way. It's about a girl turning 19, who has tried cancelling her birthday since she is trying to starve herself, but her best friend is plotting a surprise party. We are going to view the world through her eyes, her illness.

&amp;nbsp;

But here's the thing: Even though I’m choosing a horror movie style (because that was how I experienced my disorder), I don’t want to trigger people who have suffered, or ""inspire"" people who can come to be suffering. I want to keep triggers DOWN. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to focus on the lies and the social aspect of keeping an eating disorder up. I will focus on the obsession to remain in control.

&amp;nbsp;

**I have decided that the film will not:** Show numbers (scales, calories). Show the protagonist pulling her body in a mirror. Observe any very skinny body. Show “successful tricks” of how to lose weight. Make the protagonist have a job where she needs to look a certain way (model, actress, dancer).

&amp;nbsp;

**However, I do want to portray:** A binge. Purging. Excruciating hunger feelings. An obsession with food (but really, with control).

&amp;nbsp;

Do you think this can be portrayed without being too triggering? Or should I just accept that this will be a triggering film? Where is your line crossed?

&amp;nbsp;

I want to make this film partly because I think ED-films that ARE out there, aren't very good. They neither help anyone close who wants to understand, nor validates the one who has suffered who wants to be understood.

29,"I am looking for resources to help me help my fiance. She's been diagnosed with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, and depression. I love her, but every day is such a struggle, and I feel like it is getting worse, not better. I want to help, but I don't know how.

She wants no surprises or chances in her day. She tries to plan life so thoroughly to avoid anxiety that the planning overwhelms her. I feel like avoidance has taken over her life and worsened her problems. She wants me to join in on planning every detail of her life and making decisions for her so that she can avoid dealing with her avoidance. Im afraid that it isn't healthy.

She is in the process of getting professional help, but it's been a hard journey. She's going to see a new psychiatrist soon, and might be receptive to medication this time, but it's hard to say. She used to go to therapy, but she stopped because she didn't think it was helping anymore. She's been to two psychiatrists since, but never a repeat visit.

I try my best to be supportive, but I am not great at this sort of thing. When I was a troubled kid, I developed a habit of shutting down when I got overwhelmed. I would disconnect from my surroundings and day dream for an emotional escape. As I got older, I added binge eating and compulsive reading to the list. I've made a lot of progress on this, but it has been showing through more and more lately.

I don't know how to handle when her anxiety.makes her angry. I can comfort her depression, but anger pushes me out. Anything I say seems to make it worse. When she is angry, it's not directed. She's angry at everything and everyone, and something will come up that makes her furious at me. If I apologize, she is outraged because she doesn't believe me. If I try to comfort her, she's insulted. She can't stand physical contact during those times. Defending myself in conversation escalates things rapidly. Ultimately, I just shut down. I don't know what to do or say, and so I say nothing and just listen, and that pisses her off too. That's where I am right now actually, in time out essentially. And I try to understand and move on, but we are engaged, and in those furious moments she says the relationship isn't enough or that she thinks this was all a mistake. It's really hard to go through all this and feel like your love and support doesn't mean anything to them. I feel like a parent and not a partner these days.

Does anyone have any suggestions for what to do when she's angry? Links or resources? Has anyone been through this and have any advice?  I'm just so tired from breakdowns, panic attacks, sleepless nights, fights, etc that I don't know what to do anymore. I'm exhausted. I want to help, but I'm all out of ideas. Im just crossing my fingers that the new doc works out well, and that the psychiatrist doesn't breathe at an inopportune time making the fiance furious at her for being condescending, passive aggressive,  and judgemental. 

Sorry for being so negative too. I love her, but this has consumed me socially and I have no one to vent to anymore.

I understand feeling overwhelmed by everything, but it's been a week and she's shown no improvement. She can't even prepare food for herself. If I don't make food for her, she vomits from ""not eating and being overwhelmed"".

I've tried to help talk her through everything, but it's getting to the point where it's starting to effect my mental health. I've asked her to return to her psychiatrist for help, but she claims that her doctor moved. I asked her to ask her doctor for a reference to another one still in the area and she started making excuses for why she didn't need to.

I am not overly concerned that she will self-harm or anything, but she seems to be just spiraling into helplessness and I can't afford to be home enough to be her caregiver. What resources can I call upon to help me?

33,"I've always been at least a little bit paranoid. But over the summer it's gotten worse. It always starts as anxiety and then turns into being paranoid, and then mind plays these scenarios and I get freaked out. Here are some of the totally innocent things I've been scares of over the last few months.

Me and my girlfriend went to get an oil change in the car. We were sitting in the waiting area and I saw a guy sitting across the room with his hand in his pocket looking nervous af. Shitty eyes, bouncing his leg. I was convinced he had a gun in his jacket and was going to shoot up the place. I even asked my gf if we could wait outside. Then he took his hand out and turns out he was just holding a cigar. And honestly probably had social anxiety.

Last week I was at the mall standing outside smoking, and a guy in a truck passed in front, slowed down, and looked at me. I thought it was sketchy but I just tried to forget about it. Then I saw him again coming from the other direction, and when he looked at me I walked back inside. I thought he was going to come and try to grab me. Turns out, he was just picking up his wife and was looking for her.

The other day we went to the post office and I stayed in the car. As soon as my gf went in, about 3 cars pulled up. And my first thought was ""they're coming for me"" so I locked the doors and kept my eyes alert until my gf came back. 

And the most severe one of them all, a few nights ago we were laying in bed, she had fallen asleep. The house was quiet except for this weird noise. It bothered me because I hate noise while I'm trying to sleep but also this scenario started playing. A really fucked up gory scenario about what the noise could be. The sane part of me knew that wasn't happening but I just had to investigate. Just to make sure. It was the plastic from the pack of toilet paper on the air vent.

I know it's most likely my psychosis. And I'm seeing a doctor next week so I'll get my any I psychotic adjusted. But it's become a problem now.

34,"I've been suffering from depression on and off for a few years. This bout is the longest and worst I've had. I recently increased my daily dosage of sertraline from 50mg to 100mg. 

However, I feel they're having no effect. Some days I'm ok and others I feel unmotivated, hopeless, empty, frustrated with where I am in life; 30yo, crap job, single, living with my mum. 


I'm seeing my doctor this week and I know he's going to suggest reaching out to one of the local services that provide therapy. I'm unsure if that's what I want and I don't know if I have time to regularly speak to a therapist. 

I'm not suicidal. I wouldn't want to upset my family and friends. I just don't think I'll never not have depression. ",16Sep2017,2,
