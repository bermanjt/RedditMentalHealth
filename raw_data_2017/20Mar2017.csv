* Recurring suicidal behaviors or threats
* Intense and highly changeable moods, with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days
* Chronic feelings of emptiness
* Inappropriate, intense anger or problems controlling anger
* Having severe dissociative symptoms, such as feeling cut off from oneself, observing oneself from outside the body, or losing touch with reality

1,"My boyfriend of 1.5 years has suffered from depression the entire time I've known him. My feelings grew very quickly and his had not (he still hasn't said he loves me). But I've tried to be understanding considering he had been on meds prior to meeting me and nothing ever worked so he has since been unmedicated. After pushing him to try again he has been prescribed cymbalta for the past 2 months, going from 30mg to 60, and as of Monday up to 90mg. The past 2 weeks he has been super distant, not even wanting me to touch or talk to him. He says he is feeling much better and hasn't felt this way since he was a kid but why doesn't he want me to be a part of it? He says there's nobody else but that he wants to make new friends which will most likely be girls since he thinks it is weird to message guys online to hang out. ""Just as friends tho"". Regardless, I don't think it's appropriate, especially given he is pushing me away right now. He has also recently purchased a gun ( 2 weeks ago) and has been hung ho about preparing for if something happens or breaks out to where he has to take action. He quit his job and spent his last $500 on this gun. Could his all be due to the cymbalta or is he really getting better and just realizing he doesn't need me anymore. I know this can't be answered for certain with such little info but if anyone knows anything about this drug please comment with your knowledge! Thanks",20Mar2017,1
2,"This is my first time in the sub, so advanced apologies if this post isn't great. 

I have a 1 and a half year old and I feel like so far I've been a great mom. We play all day, we read and build things, go outside and just generally have fun together. I don't ever yell and very rarely have to discipline because she's so good. 

Motherhood has been going fairly smoothly but why do I feel so overwhelmed over small things? I feel like I can go from just fine to on the verge of a panic attack if there is too much going on. If she's overly clingy one day and is climbing all over me and won't let me put her down and is constantly all over me I have to take a moment to catch my breath before I scream. It's never gotten to that point yet but inside I feel like I'm going crazy. 

What prompted me to write this post is we were just in bed and she was laying all on top of me and my husband was laying next to me hugging my arm and we had covers on and I felt like I couldn't move or breath. I had to get both of them off and step outside for a minute just to catch my breath. 

I've always been somewhat claustrophobic but this level of intensity is new to me and I feel like a bad mom and wife that I can't just lay in bed with my family if they're holding onto me. 

Does anyone have any idea what's going on with me? I'm in the USA, South Carolina if that's relevant (saw it in the rules)",20Mar2017,2

6,"Well for starters I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II and ADHD and I understand self diagnosis is not good but right now financially I am not in a good place to go back to my shrink and I just want to ease these feelings a bit. I have been having for years now this.. ""delusion"" (if it is that, I really don't know) that everyone hates me. But It's weird I use to think that it was social anxiety but the truth is that I am really sociable and love being around people, going to parties and talking to strangers is easy as hell for me, no sweaty palms or anxiety attack, I don't get that feeling that they are judging me at least at first. But paranoia maybe seems... to extreme.

It's already happened multiple times but everytime I start getting close to a group of friends I start getting paranoid or anxious that they are starting to hate me, that i'm annoying them, that they are probably talking behind my back and they don't want me there. 

Because of this I start acting really awkward around them and being distant, and even when I try to suppress my feelings and have a good time it comes of as fake that results in them ACTUALLY not liking me. These symptoms ONLY show up in this specific situation. 
This leads to me having a ton of superficial friends and almost no close friends.


Recently I told a new group of friends how I was feeling and they were really startled at my feelings and irrational conclusions, and looked at me like I was crazy. But I felt it so real, I really believed they hated me and were mad at me. And I know that I am generally liked by people! I constantly hear ""I've heard only nice things about you"" and shit! But I still constantly feel like the more people know me they hate me even though I know it's not true!

Why I think that It may be paranoia is that my beliefs about my friends hating me feel so real and strong even though I have all the information to believe otherwise to the point were I don't trust my judgement anymore. And every little stupid shit I see I will go nuts making ridiculous conclusions about how that totally says they hate me, I'm starting to be annoying. 

I've never read about a ""selective"" SAD in certain situations, I don't know whats going on. I don't mean to offend anyone or make light of any of those two disorders, I just don't really understand whats happening, i'm tired of being lonely, I want to hear what others that really understand these disorders have to say.

7,"Hello,
 	My name is OQGA, and I have a mental problem. 3 years ago I entered college and finally had my first relationship. When I was little I was teased for having a crush and I have had anxiety about sharing feeling for a girl. After many no’s a girl finally said yes. First couple months were great it filled a void I look back at those pictures sometimes and seeing my smile is odd now. She broke up with me after mentally abusing me for months. Cheating on me multiple times, having sex with people behind my back. I had to lie to hang out with family and I pushed my friends away. I stayed with her because at the time I denied any evidence of her cheating. Anything that was wrong I apologized for looking back it wasn’t my fault. She would abuse me mentally by saying things after we broke up for months making me think we would get back together. A couple years have since passed and I still have a small box of everything she gave me. I open it up from time to time to smile and think back of when I was happy and read a note she gave me. Each time I open it I write a note to myself that I read each time telling me to be strong and move forward. 
	
Last year I met this girl, finally tried to be happy again. We went out a couple times but every time we went out I couldn't look her in the eyes because I am terrified. I am scared of rejection, and now have giant trust issues. So when I finally asked her to be my girl friend and move things along she said that because she was changing schools she didn't believe it was a good idea. So since she moved to upstate for college we snap every day. I visited a couple times and we went out to dinner and I finally overcame my eye contact thing and started feeling a little more comfortable. But after a while every time I tried to make plans to come up or when I was up visiting other people she is always super busy with unexpected occurrences. But I was still hoping things would get better but recently its just been dry conversations between the two of us. After she moved originally I started to be friendly with my mom’s friend’s daughter. Lets call her Jane. We first hung out at this halloween party. Her ex was there (she ran away from home with him he treated her lie crap the whole time and they broke up) and he kept causing static with me. But I was the bigger man and let it go(I am 6 foot 2, blackbelt so I can hold my own but I don't go around wanting trouble I want peace). Well so one and so forth we would hang out go go to the gun range have fun then she would disappear for a while and not reply to me or anything. Then after a while she would reply to me and we would hang out some more. But every time we hang out she would talk about her ex and it killed me but I listened. So eventually I told her how I felt and she didn't want to date anyone considering it just ruins everything and I respected that. So then after a while she disappeared again. Then reappeared and we hung out dressed as cop and robber (I was robber) last year for halloween and we went out and had a blast. Every time we hang out it feels great except when she talks abut her ex. So she disappeared again except this time she would reply to me sometimes and when making plans they would always fall through. (All this is going on she isn’t dating anyone cause her facebook stays single and her mom loves me and talks to me all the time randomly.) So in the new year I asked her again if she felt the same way about me and she gave me the same response. Well couple weeks ago she actually messaged me first (which usually never happens) and wanted to hang out so we did we had a blast stayed out till 2 am. We took a picture together. Looking at it the next day I realized something. I have the same smile I had way back when it feels right again I am happy. So we hang out pretty much every other day after we hang out she messages me she had a blast and cant wait to hang out again. And this time she hasn’t mentioned her ex at all. Until today except this time it was the ex before the last ex lets call him John. John was physically abusive. Today I helped her take a fridge out of her new apartment and helped her put things in and helped out for a while. When I was leaving she had to run to the store to pick up some stuff I asked if she wanted me to join. She said no because she has to run to her parents house to pick up some stuff and John was supposed to call her. I said what and scratched my head and she got a little defensive (I try not to push her away because I really like her. So I try to not to over step myself because after all we aren't dating. But that doesn’t mean I don't want to punch every guy that hits on her. Most recently was St. Patty's day the foreign exchange student from Belgium was hitting on her and I tried to run interference and eventually he got the hint and left us alone. (also I posted pictures off us to facebook and stuff something I try not to do in case I make girl upstate mad in the small case she is actually wanting to date which she did end up liking and we snap chatted a couple times today like normal) any way I said oh like it was normal and she relaxed again as deep down I was about to die because a couple days ago she said she had an important phone cal at 8:15 and we would hang out after. When I asked her about it at the time she said yea it went well (the phone call) But tonight she said he’s been calling every night at 8:15 talking about stuff (idk what). Then got her car and told that she should be getting her tv set up for movie nights soon for us, and then she left. After we hang out she hugs me and tells me to text her when I get home safe and I tell her the same but this time she didn’t.
	
On the way home I sped, yelled, held my knife in my hand (I am not suicidal just wanted something to hold) Am I paranoid, do I overreact, how can I move on with being more trusting, what is your opinion on this situation. What should I do. Anything you want to say will help.

8,"*Trigger warning: descriptions of self-harm

Hi all, I was asked to talk about my experiences with self-harm and my subsequent recovery.

My hope is that by sharing some of my lowest moments, people will begin to understand why self-harming occurs and how we can help ourselves and others to recover from it.

By starting a dialogue, hopefully we can help to remove some of the stigma that is holding people back from talking and thus from receiving help.

I must emphasize the trigger warning, this is a very intense read and may be triggering for some people, so please don’t approach this piece lightly.

If you feel that you or someone you know is at risk, please call emergency services now.

Please ask me anything, I am happy to chat about this with you.

9,"As I've gotten into my early twenties, I've come to realize I have a bad habit that has persisted since at least my late middle school years, and that is to believe my friends conspire against me. 

Without delving into details regarding my current situation (unless it becomes necessary for me to do so), I feel as if some of my friends are conspiring against me in order to keep me from doing a specific action, to keep information from me, or to keep me from getting what I want. I've felt like this in previous situations with varying groups of friends over the years, but they all arise in a similar fashion. Here's how it usually goes down:

1. I tell a friend personal/ private information, usually regarding a woman I may have an interest in , or something I feel about a friend. 

2. Said friend and I may discuss whatever I told him/her a few more times, and as he offers his thoughts, to which I'm accepting of hearing, but I draw boundaries that I oftentimes do not want the friend to actively involve themselves in the situation. 

3. I begin to (unconsciously?) scrutinize and analyze the relationship between my friend and whomever I discussed with him. I often end up finding myself looking for hints that he's revealed my secret or has ulterior motives.

4. I end up growing immensely suspicious of both my friend and the individual I spoke to said friend about. For example, if it's a woman, I begin to read into situations involving them both too deeply. 

5. I can't get the idea of my friend betraying me and/or things going immensely wrong out of my head and it is all I think about. 

One situation from when I was 17 best exemplifies my struggle here: I told a friend that I liked a girl, and it turned out he also liked the same girl as well ( I never knew until much later). One night, the friend, the girl, and a few other members of our friend group did not reply to texts for the entire evening, leading me to think two very far-fetched ideas:

1. The friend whom I told my secret and the girl I like must have gotten their phones taken away for sexting, because I *thought* one time that I saw a picture of breasts on my friend's phone, therefore I figured he would be inclined to compel the girl to send him topless photos. 

2. Everyone was not answering my texts because they were out having fun without me because they all felt compelled to keep me away from seeing my friend I spilled gossip to and the girl I had a crush on because they supported a relationship between them more than between the girl and myself. 

I recall, that evening, I sat journalling my fears for at least two hours. I also recall that during Skype calls with my group of friends, any conversation  involving the friend I told a secret to and whoever was the subject of the secret, I would convince myself that they were speaking in some sort of code or dropped certain phrases that only they and a select few understood in order to keep me out of the loop. 


Luckily for 17 year old me, neither of these were true, and nobody was working against me, despite my gut twisting in a knot and telling me it was so. 

This is something that I do that *seriously* bothers me, and I don't know if it points to a serious mental problem. I've never had a history of mental problems, and neither has my family. I come from a family of confident people, but I know I'm a little more mild and inclined to risk aversion than most of my family.

Essentially, why do I grow immensely suspicious of my friends, then craft grand scenarios of why they may be doing something against me? Is it because my mother told me time and time again throughout my youth to be wary of who you confide in? I know that's common sense, but how on earth did I take it to the extreme of being an extreme cynic/skeptic? 

**TLDR**: I easily grow skeptical of my friend's intentions and begin to craft grand scenarios in my head as to why they may be working against me or have ulterior motives. What's my deal?",20Mar2017,11

However, I'm currently stressed out about assignments and life in general but usually at this point I'd be having breakdowns and panic attacks but recently i've just been feeling numb.

I don't really know what it is? I wouldn't know how to talk about it to the doctors cause I feel like I sound like an idiot saying that I feel numb and I'm starting to not feel any kind of emotion. I've lost any sense of excitement for anything and even things I used to love.

22,"Lately my misophonia has been getting worse for some reason. It's making it extremely hard to stay in school and focus because my spanish teacher clears his throat a certain way, which causes disturbing and unwanted sexual arousal, extreme irritation, and violent thoughts. I go to a private school, and the entire building is very small so I can hear him doing it all day.  

For some background, misophonia is a disorder that causes irrational reactions to certain noises. Lip smacking, loud chewing, coughing, sneezing, and throat clearing are common triggers. Anger and irritation are the most common reactions to these triggers.  

Yes, I am fully aware this is entirely irrational and people can't help making these noises. I can't control it, even though I wish I could.

For the past two years I've fucked up a lot of my college experience and I think I was probably on the brink of depression. Maybe for a few months it was actually depression, I don't know. The labels don't really matter so much for me. Right now I feel like I've mostly pulled myself out of it but I still screw up a lot and I think I need to actively work on my problems, which I haven't really been doing. I need to do the following: exercise, maintain consistent sleep hygiene, and somehow find a way to control my inner monologue. I don't think I'm a very anxious person but I definitely have thoughts that bother me, mostly about how I've fucked up so much and how I'm so scared I won't be able to accomplish anything because of it, and because of how I'm so insecure about myself. I feel like I waver in between thinking everything is going to be okay and then thinking nothing will be okay. Maybe it's a bigger problem than I realize?
