0,Hey all. I have just been put on latuda. Two days ago I started on 20 mg of Latuda and today took first 40 mg of latuda. I am taking it for psychosis and/or schrizophrenia. How many people here taking it and how has it been like for you all? How long does it normally take to see improvement in how people feel while being on this medicine? I have seen no improvement or side effects for myself yet. Is this normal?,27Aug2017,1
1,"This is a throwaway acct. I didn't feel comfortable posting this on my regular one. I just want to die some times. Tonight being one of them. In the last 8 months, my life has gone to complete and total shit. Two people very close to me died back to back from cancer. I was layed off at my job. My love life is virtually non-existent. My father is developing early stages of dementia. I have no support. No one to turn to. So I thought I'd just post here to get it all off my chest. I just don't want to live anymore. I almost feel like I can't. I don't feel like committing suicide, but I just don't want to be alive anymore. I can't sleep, eat, I always feel like absolute dog shit. I just don't know what the fuck I should do. I can't keep going. I just fucking can't. Some times I hope that I have like an aneurysm or some thing, just so I die quick; at the snap of a finger.

2,"My name is Jerome and I live in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Today has been a rough day I have spent a majority of it crying for no apparent reason. I am 20 years old I go to college but I live with my parents. I can't talk to them about the sadness I am going through because well we don't have a great relationship they are pretty traditional and I know what they will say and I don't think I could take it. I just feel so lonely but at the same time I don't want a relationship I just want someone to talk to. This might sound weird but a few years ago I had a stuffed animal and despite it being inanimate I talked to and it helped with vent my feelings without judgement coming my way. We moved and I haven't had that source of comfort. I have always had a hard time making friends due to my personality (people have said I am rude and nasty) and my appearance (most of elementary and junior high I had mushroom haircut which made me a target for bullies) so I am alone with nobody to talk to. The only thing that keeps me going is the prospect of moving to the US after graduation or a few years after graduation, this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI80s-8G1bQ) by my favorite artist Susanna Hoffs and the prospect of one day meeting Susanna and maybe singing with her (weird and ambitious I know) but I don't know if I can make it. Anyways thanks for allowing me to vent sorry if this goes against the rules of this subreddit, sorry about my spelling/grammar and sorry if I was vague I can elaborate more if you want!",27Aug2017,2

6,"One of my family members (who married into the family) who I'm also currently living and working with has PPD and I just want to know how to deal with them.  
  
  
This person does not acknowledge that they have a problem - they are suspicious of everyone and see conspiracies/ backstabbing etc where there is none.
  
  
They are extremely difficult to deal with day to day both inside and outside of work. They work from home and rarely leave the house using the excuse that they have too much work to do!! 
  

  
They are always throwing accusations at me with no evidence / irrational thought logic. It has started to affect my own mental health as i'm constantly on edge as i never know if the things i do or say will spark a paranoid reaction.
  

  
I am planning on leaving the family company due to these problems and moving out to minimise contact with them but this will no doubt reinforce their paranoid delusions that i was using them for money and now i have it i will leave; which is not true.

  
  
So, does anybody have any experience in dealing / coping with a person with PPD (Who doesn't acknowledge the problem)?",27Aug2017,2

13,"Just to be clear: I know it takes a professional to diagnose a mental illness and treatment, but we have seen professionals for several years and have yet to get a clear cut diagnosis that really helps, so I would love your thoughts.

My girlfriend has been going through a very hard time for years now, and we feel like it may be because she has yet to get a clear diagnosis and treatment that can help her, so I thought I might share some of her symptoms and you can tell me what you think.

Her mother is bipolar, and she spent a long time being told that she probably is bipolar, too. But in the past, she's been treated for depression, anxiety and ADD. She is a wonderful person, but she will often be very irritable. She can go from talking perfectly calmly to weeping on the floor to screaming with rage. My heart breaks for her, not knowing how to help her sometimes. 

Obviously she does have bipolar tendencies. She can get very depressed, and when she's manic, it usually expresses itself in anger. She has an addictive personality, mostly when it comes to food and leisure time. She also can experience severe hypersensitivity, when sights, sounds and touch can set her off. 

Researching into it, I also suspected for a while that she might be borderline. But then she will have these constant intrusive thoughts, suggesting possibly OCD or else the preexisting ADD.

She has been suicidal in the past, and has self-harmed. To top it all off, she has an incredibly low opinion of herself, always putting herself down, not giving herself enough credit, and beating herself up. I am ALWAYS trying to build her up, and be there for her, but I've learned that her happiness is not my responsibility.

Still, I love her so much, and I want to do what I can to help her. She has been going to therapy and taking medication since she was 15 (she's 23 now) but I fear that she's not truly getting the help she needs. That's what I hate about mental illness, that sometimes finding the right diagnosis can take so long. If anyone has any suggestions or answers, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.",27Aug2017,1

I hate myself! I'm a fuck up! I'm a loser! I'm a piece of shit! I ruin everything. Everything is my fault. I want to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to kill myself. I have nothing. I have no one. Just my constant thoughts. My thoughts are of self doubt. Mostly suicide. Why am I so angry. Nothing makes me happy. ***** used to make me happy.

Anxiety. I want to love but my heart and my mind won't let me. I want to be loved but all of my issues won't let me. I seem emotionless sometimes. I feel like a bottomless black pit. I just keep falling and it's getting darker. My mind is racing. It won't stop. All I can think about is the family that I fucked up. ****** and ***** were my family. My issues got in the way of that. Even if I fixed my issues it's to late. I want to be happy again but I tore apart the only things in life that made me happy. Or at least somewhat happy. As happy as my issues let me. I hate myself so much that I try to make others hate themselves. Misery loves company. I tried to get help. That didn't work. It just made it worse.

Only for the night though. Afterwards it's awful. I feel even worse than before I took the drugs or drank. In my mind though it's worth it. I don't get to feel happiness very often.

My wife and I are getting ready to move (to be back with her family--it's a cross country move though), and she has been very stressed about it. Over the last couple weeks she's been very worried about everything, especially really mundane things. Like how she will get her computer there, or how many email addresses she has. I brushed it off as weird stress-related behavior, but yesterday things got a lot worse.

She is very confused and disoriented. She isn't talking much but is asking me questions like who I am, or if I'm her real husband, or where she is, or what's going on. She has lost touch with reality.

She can still function and has been folding her clothes and packing, but she mainly just paces around and asks ""what's going on? This is so stupid why is this happening"" about every 30 minutes or so.

Her mom just flew in and is going to take her home early to see a psychiatrist, but I was hoping someone here could offer feedback if something similar has happened to someone you know.

For context, she's 28 years old, and has never exhibited symptoms like this in her life. She's had minor battles with depression, but nothing out of the ordinary. She's always been super outgoing and fun-loving. Her brother was diagnosed with bi-polar around age 25. She also doesn't take any drugs besides trazodone to help her sleep.

In doing my own research it looks like Schizophrenia, Bi-Polar, and Major Depressive Disorder occur in women around this age usually spurred by a major life event.

Are these signs that reality has become too much and they're turning to an outlet to escape? Is it healthy or unhealthy?

25,"Whenever I get the desire to create something it seems to be only about the end goal. For example, I was at the Comic Con recently and felt a strong desire to learn to draw and paint afterwards, but when I think about the action of doing it, it seems exhausting. 

I also use to be the bassist in a band (many many years ago) and have no desire to pick up the instrument. I've thought about learning to produce electronic music since I have an interest in synthesizers, but at the same time I don't really wanna do it. It's interesting but not enough to take action on.
When I used to play guitar/bass on my own (outside of a group) I would typically learn half or a third of a song and move on to the next one instead of finishing it.

There used to be a time where I dabbled in many different hobbies, but I never dove that deep into any. Now I can't even do that; all I can do is browse the internet or watch tv. I don't want to even play games anymore. Recently got an oculus rift and somehow that's not even stimulating enough to bother with after a few days of using it.

It seems that the primary motivator in life has been fear. Fear of lack of money. Fear of my tiny family dwindling. It's been enough to help me keep up a 3.7 GPA. I have a Bachelor of Science and about to finish my Master of Science, but I don't even wanna be pursuing a career in the field I'm studying anymore. However, there is nothing else I'm good at and I've accumulated a massive debt that I need to pay off while pursuing my masters.

I'm not sure if there is a way to get out of this funk since it's all I know, but it's making life increasingly meaningless. I eat well (aside from drinking a few days a week), meditate, try to keep up a good sleep schedule, but I always seem to return to this dull funk. Not sure what's wrong with me and what to do about it.


-- tl;dr --

I find things I'm interested in but have no desire to take action on them. Would love to be able to write my own book, graphic novel, song, but the act of learning to do it and taking action on it seems like climbing Mount Everest during a never-ending snow storm.

33,"Edit: ""normal""

I don't hear voices. I don't have anything in my head that feels separate from me. But, I just noticed today that my normal thoughts are always in a different voice. Even reading this, as I write it, its being said in a somewhat effeminate, higher pitched voice. I don't believe I've ever heard my own voice in my head. Alternatively, sometimes I think in a gruff manly voice. Or in a young mans voice that is completely different from my own. I asked my mother about this and she said she only hears her own voice in her head. Then theirs countless others that will exist only for a little bit. Different genders, accents, pitches, speed, everything. I found a couple things online similar to my question, but most of the answers were along the lines of ""people think in different voices?"" 

Its not particularly troubling, but I do have some mental issues with depression and possible bipolar disorder. So I kinda just like to separate what is and is not considered normal for my own sake, as I'm currently doing lots of therapy. 

Any information on it would be great. All Google brings up is a book called ""In A Different Voice"" so I can't find any information on this.

38,"I started hearing voices in my head. Intrusive thoughts. They seemed to me to be coming from far away, mostly mumbles and lost to the distance as though someone were shouting something at me. For a long time I thought that it was a real person who was saying all this stuff to me. 

There's a lot of voices, several male and several female. They alternate, like taking turns shouting insults. 

I feel paranoid, like someone is watching me. I tried to tell my parents about the voices - saying to them, ""there's somebody really out there."" but they don't hear anything. My therapist and psychologist think it's psychosis, and so I'm on meds for that, but they don't seem to be helping. 

I think a lot, if not all, of my mental health issues stem from a brief period of heavy drug use. I used a lot hallucinogens - LSD, LSA, DXM in cough syrup. I used an amphetamine analogue called 4F-MPH which is basically speed. I also used opiates, but not to the same degree as the speed. 

I was on a three week binge of speed, I had taken multiple bumps throughout the day, everyday for that period of time. I was paranoid as all hell. I was pulling switchplates off of the walls and checking the outlets for cameras. I had the shades in my bedroom permanently drawn down. I rarely went out. Eventually I had a seizure from all the shit I was taking. Not long after that, I had tried to kill myself, and was placed in a mental ward for about a month. 

It's now 7 months since I was let out of the mental ward, and I start hearing voices in my head like when i would use speed. I'm at the same level of paranoia, and the only drugs I use are those prescribed to me. And alcohol i guess. But I seem to be more dismissive of the voices when I drink. 

Hearing these voices is frightening. A large part of me thinks they're real and another part says they're not. I'm torn. They make threats, make reference to specific actions that I do, as though they were looking at me as I sit in my room. 

No matter how much reality checking I do, I can't escape the feeling of paranoia. I feel like I'm just on the edge of sanity, waiting to fall into a pit. Like Syd Barett, who took so much LSD it activated a schizophrenia in him. I think the same has happened to me. 

I just don't know what to do or how to manage this. Writing all of this was cathartic enough, but the problem seems interminable. I really just can't take it anymore. Suicide reenters my brain a lot. I try not to think about negative things, but I wallow in it. 

What's even stranger is that I've grown so accustomed to hearing the voices that when I don't hear them a part of me becomes disappointed, as though I'd unwillingly developed a relationship with these black thoughts. 

Anyhow, if you took the time to read all this, then thanks. If you didn't, well I guess it doesn't matter that much.",27Aug2017,0

42,"Hello

First of all, I am not a native English speaker, so excuse me for the mistakes I'll make writing this post. Also, I don't know if I am in the right place to post this. Lastly, this is an fresh account, not my real reddit account.


I'll try to keep it short, but this is going to be a long read. I just need help. If only one people read this and gives me a good advice, I'd deeply appreciate your time.


I am currently a 17 years old male (Living in Belgium (French-Speaking.). I've had a hard time growing up. I've been bullied for a pretty long time, up to 15 years old, something like that. About me : I play video games a lot, I like to watch movies, I code sometimes (I'll start to code more this year for CS.) Sometimes I also like to write and do some world building. (I created a whole world with its story and stuff, and I like to think of new events, etc)

At first (&lt;12yo), I was the little, some would say ""smart"" (all 'A's) kid in the class that everybody made fun of. Someone's new ? No problem, just bully me and everyone will like you. For instance,A lot of people of my age were reading stories and other books of their age, I was reading scientific &amp; historic books. At the age of 10, I read a book about programming with C, and learned programming with it. Later I learned Java and C++. Needless to say, when you are a little bit smarter than the other kids, it never ends well.

I'm going to skip a good part of the whole story, but **TL;DR** : I went through a lot, mentally speaking. Bullies never went as far as hitting me hard physically, but they made sure I was hit mentally. Teachers mostly didn't give a shit, or unknowingly made it worse (by making me tell answers to look smart, etc). I went to one psychologist, and she didn't give a shit of what I was telling her, and never called back to make a new appointment.

The consequences of all of theses years of bullying are here : I'm always feeling like I'm a complete failure of a human being, and I feel like peoples around me are always better at something than I am. If I was not good at programming, I'd be feeling like shit most of the time. (The fact that I'm kinda good at this helped me as a kid,and probably helped me to not  think about suicide a lot).


Where was I heading to ? Ah yeah. Moving on. I'm gonna describe me a bit so you can know me better. (And maybe tell me if there is something wrong with me?)


After the bullying (kinda) ceased, I started to feel a bit better, but always somewhat empty on the inside. I also liked a few girls in the last years, but never told any of them. Why ? Because I felt like a unworthy peace of shit, that it was completly worthless to even try to speak to them. So I'm 17 and I've never had a GF, which makes me feel like I'll be alone all my life, that love is just not for me and that I'll never have a healthy relationship while I hear many friends talking about the dozens of sexual experiences they had. You guessed it, it makes me feel really like shit even more. Have I thought about suicide yet ? A lot. But I'm a coward, I don't think I'll ever attempt it. (I just can't bring myself to try it, knowing that i'll leave my family behind. I also can't think of a good way to do it as I don't have access to stuff like a gun. The fact that I never had a quick and easy way to kill myself helped too)

I Also feel like I'm just good at nothing. I tried drawing : I never did anything good. I tried (and still kinda trying not to abandon that) playing music with Bass guitar, but I feel like I'll never be good. Most of the time I'm lazy and don't even want to train, because I'm feeling like it's never gonna work. Same for the Gym, I've been going to the gym for the past 1.5 years, but now i want to give up. I feel like I'm not gaining a lot of muscle, and when i'm there I feel like i'm the weakest, like I Don't belong here.

One last thing, that I think is kinda important. I Always ""judge"" myself mentally. There's that voice in my head (*my* voice. it's just me talking to me) criticizing everything I do. Examples : (thoughts are in () ) I want to compliment someone ? (Noo, you'll look weird). I Want to post something on facebook ? (Why the fuck would anyone care?). Why not go and meet new people ? (Lol, they'll make fun of you like everyone else.). Sometimes I'm just talking to myself mentally, having short conversations with myself when thinking about some stuffs. This ""voice"" makes me paranoïd too, I just don't dare trying new stuff now.

I'll keep stop here, there's other (minor) stuff too, but this is getting too long. If you want to hear more, don't hesitate to contact me.

I really want to get some help. Should I seek for a psychologist, or a psychiatrist? Is there something wrong with me, or it's just anxiety/paranoïa that came with the bullying? Also, what can I tell to my parents to convice them to let me get mental advice from a professional without telling them too much ? 


I'll finish this with one last thing, my future. I want to believe I'll get better. After my 3 years of CS, when I graduate, I just want to move to a new country, something far away like Canada or Australia (My favorite country) and start a new life there. But I also feel like this future will never come, like this is not possible. I think i'll just screw it up before anything good happens, either by fucking up or killing myself. I feel like i'll never find a place in society and be normal.


Thanks a lot, kind person that will, maybe, read this, and I hope you have a good day.
