2,"I've (17F) been taking 1mg of risperidone and 50mg of sertraline for a month or so. I stared lactating a few weeks ago and I just missed my period for this month.

 At first,  I thought it was from over stimulation but I'm still lactating a few weeks later. I took a pregnancy test at home and it says negative.
Should I tell my doctor or should I get a blood test first? ",27Mar2017,3
3,"So, I talk to myself a lot. It's something I've done as far as I can remember. When I say that, I don't mean I hear voices, more like I think out loud. I'm fully in control and it's my own voice. Of course, when I'm in public, I do it under my breath and without moving my mouth because people would think I was strange if they see my talking to myself. 
However, I also talk to myself when I feel ashamed or like I failed. I'll belittle and disparage myself and insult myself.

Sometimes I also have conversations with myself, like a back and forth when contemplating or deciding something, the same way someone has mental dialogue, but out loud.
Sometimes I'll use slightly different voices to better distinguish between the sides. I never ever give the voices names in fear that one day one of them will actually gain ""reality"" and become an actual voice in my head I can't control. I worry that one day, when I am angry or fall into a particularly bad case of depressed, one of these days a voice could come out that. An actual voice, like in a schizophrenic way, telling me horrible things.

Could this happen? Is this a bad habit I should break?",27Mar2017,3

I just can't be ars*d to do anything, I've not suffered anything stressful or traumatising, I've just seem to have lost my get up and go and it's really bothering me... 

I can't even motivate myself to speak to a girl I like its that bad...

8,"I'm not sure the best way to articulate my situation, but it feels like my life has been going in a downward spiral and I KNOW for a fact my mental health is suffering right now.

A few years ago I started smoking weed. Only smoked it every now and again till around a year and  half ago. Been smoking it heavily ever since (although recently I've been cutting down a lot).

So, I started college 2 years ago and am coming to my final few months. These past few months, I've had no motivation to do anything, I have no motivation to DJ or produce music, which I used to do on a daily basis. I can't sit down and work on a track without just getting bored and leaving it. I make excuses not to go to college almost everyday. I sleep in till late afternoon and stay up till around 5am almost every night. I came home drunk one night and told my Mum that I was depressed, although she brought it up the next day and I told her I was just talking rubbish because I was drunk. She always asks if I'm okay, and I know I have people round me that care. I've just been feeling incredibly low these past few months, however I have no idea why or how. My goal in life is to make a living off of producing music and DJ'ing but again, I just don't have any motivation to do ANYTHING. I just sit at my PC all day wasting my days. I'm 18, does anyone have any advice?",27Mar2017,1

12,"Would like to go ahead and say that I in no way shape or form intend to hurt myself or others, so there is no need to report anything. 

I also hope that my identity is somehow concealed (to some degree) so that no one in my day to day life sees this.

In 2014 I was diagnosed with having Major Depressive Disorder. I thought this was an accurate diagnosis, but I feel like that's not it. I literally think that I am insane. Some of my thoughts are not my own. My whole life I have had horrifying imagery and ""voices"" that I can't control. For example, I will be walking down the street, and I will feel the urge to push someone out into traffic. Like someone is telling me ""just do it"". It feels like I struggle to control my body, that one day I will lose control of it And I will hurt someone. I laugh at things that aren't there. I talk to things that aren't there because I get so lost in my head that I am in a fog, and then whisper my thoughts to myself because I'm so deep in thought that I don't realize I'm doing it. 

I have very narcissistic thoughts. I hate people that are better than me, because I'm a perfectionist and there's no reason that I shouldn't be able to do what they do. Which is why I hate myself. 

I will be happy for no reason, then extremely sad. I literally want to die. I don't see the point in living. 
I am not contemplating suicide. I was raised in a religious home. I am afraid that if I kill myself, that I will go to hell. This fear alone is more powerful than the urge to do it. I have dreams and imagery of myself dying. 

I am self-destructive. I sabotage my relationships with others, but then I feel sad because I'm lonely, and then I'll turn right back around and hate the people in my life. I can't get emotionally attached to people, or form connections or relationships. 

I am a peice of shit because I have no reason to be unhappy, but I am. My parents worked so hard to give me a good life, and yet I have never been able to be fully happy. I don't know why.

Most people think that mental disorders are just a murky layer on top of a normal individual. That might be the case, but not for me.  I feel like this is the normal me. I can literally not imagine how it would feel otherwise, so how can I be the judge. ",28Mar2017,4

15,"My mother was my world. I went to her for absolutely everything, we had one of the best mother/daughter bonds you could have. I wasn't afraid to tell her anything, and never hesitated about it. 

I have really horrible anxiety and depression issues, which she would support me through. She also had anxiety/depression her entire life, so she knew how to help me with it. 

We would do everything together. Go shopping, help her cook, listen to music, take care of the house, etc. We were never really apart from each other. As i said before, we had an amazing bond. 

She had a past history of alcoholism, drugs, etc. This was all before i was born, but it was really intense. It almost killed her multiple times, she was in her late 30's/40's. Last year in may, it began catching up with her. She was diagnosed with liver disease. She was in an out of the hospital, continually getting worse for a month and a half, until she passed away due to pneumonia and liver failure. 

I can't get the memories from her being in the hospital out of my head. She was in the hospital 4 times, for atleast 4 days each time. It was horrible. I skipped all of my school work from the beginning of may until the end of school to be at the hospital with her. Out of the four siblings i have, I was the only one too visit. It made sense for 3/4, they were in another state 600 miles away. My other sister on the otherhand, lived with us. She just didnt feel like going. Im not going to get into that though. 

Ever since she passed my anxiety and depression has gotten worse than ever before. I've been in counseling since the day after my mother passed. The pain doesn't stop. On some days its easier sure, but it still hurts. it still destroys me every single day. My step father already moved on and fell inlove with a new girl, my sister took her money and ran, havent spoken to her in 5 months. I rarely speak to the rest of my siblings, and thats the only family i have. I don't have anymore other than them. I feel so fucking alone in all of this, i have no one to turn too who really understands this mental fucking torture im going through. This internal pain that hurts me so badly I want to vomit. It keeps me up until 6-7 in the morning because I can't get the thought of how life would be different if my mom was still here. 

My anxiety is constant. I have no break from it, Im constantly feeling on edge and worried and scared, for absolutely no reason. Its exhausting. 

My depression is always with me. I always have this heavy ache in my body that makes me want to get into my bed and never leave it. It makes me want to give up on everything I do, and drop all friend/relationships I have. 

I feel like im dying inside. I feel so empty and sad and hurt. Im not suicidal, but I dont want to keep going. I dont want to live my life without her here. She didn't even get to see me graduate yet. 

Im still so young and I havent even started my life yet and im so afraid to start it. Who am i going to go too when i need help with something? What about advice? Legal help, buying a house/apartment, getting married or having kids?? I don't have anyone. 
 It doesn't feel fair. Both of my biological parents are dead and i feel like i have no one too go too. I don't have a support system. I don't have anyone to talk too (except my therapist, and my LDR s/o) 

I know she wouldnt want me to hurt so badly for this long, but I cant help it. She would want me to smile and be happy and look back on our memories and be so thankful to have such an amazing mother as she was. Don't get me wrong, I am so beyond thankful she was my mom. I am so proud and happy to say she was my mom, and to share the memories with her, but know I cried so hard typing that. that i had to stop and remind myself to breathe. 

I've been told to just take it day by day, and let myself hurt and cry and be in agony, and i have been; It's just getting worse as the days go on, and I don't know what to do. 

I know eventually I will be okay. I know eventually I will learn to accept my moms death, and as much as it hurts me to type this, learn to live without her.  It just feels so far away. It feels like a goal that is absolutely impossible to reach, and I dont know if I ever will reach it. 

Im sorry if my spelling is bad or something, I've been crying and shaking and just a mess throughout typing this. 

Also, im just going to answer some questions I feel like im going to get:

Why not talk to someone at school/make friends?: Im homeschooled. All of my teacher are online, across the state. 

You should tell your therapist all of this: She knows this and much more. ",28Mar2017,21
16,"This is no joke, I want to know if there is any real cause for concern. 

I question everything. I won't get started that I have to talk to myself out loud to stop the process but I want to know why I am even going through this process.

I mean everything, from making mental lists and marking off things I needed to get done to questioning if something I experienced even went the exact way I remembered it.

I will give you a mundane example. I am a big fan of a certain tv show. Had issues with watching the newest episode and have avoided that channel like the plague until I see it. Channeling surfing I forgot I was avoiding that station and I literally saw less than a second of a preview for next week's episode. Didn't hear anything just real quick. I think I identified two characters that were in that scene and I know the show was already heading into that from the start. I'm not too certain what I saw. However, this is an example of this mental hurdle I have as I questioned to myself out loud whether or not it was a spoiler. 

That is just a mundane example, I got more. Some times I talk to myself about anything and like I said I never truly get over anything. What is going on?",28Mar2017,1
17,"19 Male, so starting around senior year of high school I started to feel very disconnected and in a cloud. It was really hard for me to focus and stay really connected with reality, I constantly felt stuck in my head and not really in touch with what was happening. I always find myself drifting off and thinking about something and really can’t stay concentrated, it almost feels like I am in a dream most of the time/blur. I am currently doing a gap year here in Germany and I still have this going on today. I live a very healthy life style, workout every day, eat healthy foods, etc. I went to a doctor and got blood tests a year and a half ago to see if it was anything in me and everything came out normal. I do have a history with anxiety, but nothing really much other than that. I really want to try to fix this but I really don’t know what to do. Any tips or help would be much appreciated.

18,"Trigger warning: drugs, mental illness, sexual assault

TLDR: the reaction of friends, strangers and family to me talking about my past trauma was varied and surprising.

I have been blogging and pod-casting about my traumatic childhood and subsequent mental illness, and recently released a biographical book that goes into depth about the trauma that I faced in my fathers home.

Has was an addict, paranoid schizophrenic, chronic hoarder and drug dealer. Whilst he never directly hurt me, his clientele were a different story. Due to the neglect and trauma that I faced, I dissociated into my mind in an attempt to escape what was happening at the time. I was left with some significant mental issues that I am still dealing with.

I decided to share my story after I was convinced that it could help people to recover as well as to reduce some of the stigma around mental illness and trauma.

However, now that I have released my story and have been talking about it a lot. I have had many different reactions to it. Some of my friends that I never new were suffering have come out and started to share their stories, which is amazing and healing for all involved.

Strangers that have read my story have said that it is helping them to better understand themselves/partners who have gone through/are going through similar issues.

My family on the other hand have not been as supportive, in my book I talk about my father - the way I knew him. But some of my relatives have said that that 'wasn't the person that they knew'. Which feels like it is somewhat downplaying the things that happened to me.

I suppose that they knew him before he became my father, thus for them they now have to integrate this new information into their world view, which for some would be a hard thing to do.

I discuss this more here (podcast episode): http://www.zachary-phillips.com/realitycheck/016

I am curious as to what has happened when you have shared your past with people. Was there reactions that you expected? Do you regret it?",28Mar2017,10
19,"Hey, I just found this sub, I've never delt with someone depressed in my personal life. I'm an EMT so I deal with depressed and suicidal people regularly, but never someone who directly effects me. 

My girlfriend and I are both in our very early 20s, we've been together for 2 1/2 years and she's never shown any signs of depression or any type of suicidal ideations, and as far as I'm aware, has no history of such. In the past week or so she's seemed a bit disconnected, hasn't responded to my texts as much. Today she barely responded to me at all and when we finally started talking she said she was feeling really depressed recently. I tried to get her to talk more about it, but she said she was tired and was going to sleep and that was the end of that. 

She lives at home with her parents still (as do I) and her dad is extremely overbearing on her, he might be a bit emotionally abusive as well. She is regularly called fat and lazy by him and he basically just shits on her daily about not having a job and never doing anything useful, always telling her she does nothing around the house (when she's the one who does almost everything). He never let's her leave the house to be with me, only if she leaves without him knowing. This then causes him to be even more of a dick to her. 

I don't know how to approach this, I need help so I can help her. ",28Mar2017,1

29,"Coming up soon, I have a psychiatrist appointment to talk about Prozac and how it's been working for me. I gotta tell her about some side effects I'm getting, but most of all, I have decided to talk about a problem I've had for a long time. 

For about 4 or 5 years now, I've been dealing with intrusive thoughts, or at least I think they are. I'm not sure. But i am swarmed by thoughts about violence, death, blood, and then I also have intrusive thoughts about eating nonfood items quite often. 

There's a possibility it is Pure O ocd, my sister who has OCD [severe] said so, but she said to make sure with a psychiatrist. I've decided that despite how afraid I am to reveal to her that I have incredibly violent thoughts every day, I need to bring it up. Whether or not they're intrusive, they cause me distress. I can't tell if i enjoy them, I can't tell if they're normal, and I can't tell if they're part of my [diagnosed] paraphilias or not. I don't like being so obsessed with these things and feeling compulsed to see blood. It results in feeling like I need to self harm every single day so that I won't hurt someone else. I only hurt myself because I need to see violence and release the anger trapped inside me. I have AvPD and PTSD so the expression of anger is incredibly difficult for me. The only way to express it is through bleeding. 

As you can tell, I need help for this. I just really needed to share and get some opinions on this. Do you think I'm going to be evaluated? I'm terrified that they're going to tell my mom/dad. My last counselor made me tell my mom about violent thoughts about hurting others and it was humiliating. ",28Mar2017,6

39,"In 2015 i was diagnosed with bipolar 2. It was shit simply put. I was in the dumps completely and believed there was no way out. Suicide was tried and failed and i grew an obsession with it. It was all i thought about every day and every night. Before bed I'd ask God not to let me wake up again. It was bad.

My ex left me and it sent me into a downward spiral. Anxiety and depression hit me hard and what made matters worse was that there was no reason that could have triggered it. It was not like i had a tough time growing up. In fact i think i have it pretty easy. Id hit cold sweats at the weirdest times, ill wake up in the middle of the night feeling like something is gripping my heart. So eventually i realized somethings wrong and I need help. Made an appointment with the mom and went to the psychologist and psychiatrist. The psychologist said sometimes a brain just isnt really good enough at making all the needed chemicals to keep your mood stabilized. I was working through some shit but it was not extreme. Just personal growing up stuff. Id get these voices telling me im not good enough and the all time special, some people are not meant to survive. Bipolar is a bitch. It eats yoy up from the inside and makes you believe youre a nobody. It really is like another being breaking yoy down constantly and it feels like youre at this war with yourself that you just cant win. But i did.

The psychiatrist gave me some medicine and i swear i fucking tripped for 3 days straight. I did not eat or sleep and had an INSANE manic episode. Like i spent 3 days and 2 nights writing out a huge ass business plan. Started coding . set up a website that next day and got some stuff running. And sometimes itll feel just overwelming so ill crawl into a corner and cry for 2 hours. The go back at it. Then after the 4th day i was just wasted. And slowly i was allowed to get my sanity back. The voices stopped. For the first time in years i felt stable. Tired. But stable. 

2016 was kinda crap. I failed my matric twice. And a semester studying and i heard just now that i failed my first semeater in something else. But its okay. Its life. It does get me down but I refuse to go down that hole again. I do get anxiety attacks. And i still do obsess with stuff. 

But with this i learnt THAT I AM GETTING ANXIETY ATTACKS and I do obsess with stuff. And thats very important. Because the psychologist helped me deal with with and gave me the neccesary skills to deal with it whenever it comes back. And now its easy. Some months are better than others but so be it. And i am not scared of it because i know im in control. This took 2 years. Its not long and i think i sorted it out pretty early so im lucky.

This is my testimony. Its not a big deal but its something I worked through and got through. And you can too. Its a part of life. Life has ugly sides and beautiful sides. You just gotta slap it so it shows the nice side every now and again. Its like a fitness skill. In the beginning it took me weeks to get over the anciety attack. Now it takes a few hours maybe a day.

People I never even spoke to, I believed I was a promising rapper for example and started writing random lines to people. It was so cringe and im embarrased for it now. Not only that but I wrote a lot of crap too that didn't make any sense and made me look like a weirdo. I also had some violent outbursts during these episodes.

When she saw it she would tell me how ugly it was. And how she didn't want me to be seen with her. She had also been telling me about how I'd gained weight and looked ugly now. And how I dressed was embarrassing to her. 

She had a way of saying things in a way she could deny. She would tell me about how she wouldn't want to be seen going out partying with me because I'm no fun. And that she couldn't find me attractive because of the way I dressed. She was also distant for little to no reason. 

I tried to talk to her about it. But she would deny it. Saying nothing was wrong. I had to start travelling an hour into London to see her if I wanted to. My PTSD and London do not mix well and she knew that. But didn't care. Telling me I was just being weak. After a while she told me she didn't want me to touch we anymore. Because I wasn't attractive enough. I later found out she had been cheating on me. She would go to events and stay with her friends, sharing hotel beds with other men, telling me it was ok because her friends weren't interested in her. 

When she dumped me she cut off contact. A month after breaking up I decided to contact her. I wasn't coping and wanted to ask if we could just talk and try and be friends or at least have some resolution. I was not mentally stable at the time and she didn't want to talk. I attempted suicide after that for the first time. I left her a message (my suicide note). Sadly. I failed my attempt. Just throwing up everywhere for the night and having severe stomach pain for the next morning. I told her I was still alive. She called me a manipulative liar and called the police saying I was harassing her. Sadly, I think I was in a way. But I wasn't meaning to. I just wanted a 10 minute talk so I could understand and we could forgive and forget. And my mentally unstable mind couldn't cope with that. I attempted 3 times after that. Without telling her. 

I met someone new 2 months ago and decided to send my ex partner a message to say I forgive her and I'd moved on. Both me and my new partner had suffered with abusive ex partners and decided it was a good way to move on. After that message 2 or so weeks later the police arrived at my house at 6:00am and arrested me for malicious communication. My ex partner had made allegations against me. Sadly deleting her messages and only including mine out of context. I never sent anything malicious. I know this because several people have seen my messages in context and don't see anything wrong with them. But her false allegations were enough to get me detained for 21 hours. It was the scariest experience of my life. Silence I the cell. I wasn't allowed to talk to anyone. And I was eventually let out in Brixton in my pajamas at 2am or so. After that my ex partner messaged all my friends and family saying she would always be there for me. And has been continuing to message them. 

I just don't know. Yeah. I know I should've left things. I'm still mentally ill. I still want to attempt. I still self harm. I just want resolution but I'll never get it. I want her to leave me alone. And stop trying to ruin my life. I guess that's my brain dump. And everyone can now hate me as much as I hate me",28Mar2017,3
44,"Hi guys, 
Got a lot on my mind right now so this could be quite a long post but will try and keep it as brief as I can. 

Here's the situation, what I tend to do is seriously overthink things to the point where things beat me down/eat me alive to the point where I can no longer really focus and enjoy my life. I lost my Nan last April, we were very close and her death was a very sudden thing. She was diagnosed with cancer in mid-March and then passed away at the end of April. We were very very close so it has been a very hard process dealing with the loss. With that being said, I really don't feel like I've fully grieved properly and it hasn't really quite sunk in yet, even though it's almost been a year. 
From what I remember, it was shortly after that I began to have these 'flashbacks' to these times, mainly that involved confrontation with somebody else. Although I've made up with the guys that I had these experiences with, I began to get some serious anxiety about the situations which actually happened a very long time ago. 

To give you more of an insight, I began to get anxiety about a guy that I had a bit of trouble with in a club. This was the most recent of the experiences that I speak of. We were both drunk and all it was was a bit of touchy-pushy type stuff and we actually shook hands and sorted it out that same night. Then maybe about 6 months later I began to get some serious anxiety about it, thinking that what if this guy saw me out again and tried to start trouble. This ate me away for a long time before I finally decided to just message him and clear everything up to make sure that we were cool. As expected, he didn't even remember and we sorted things out straight away.

Next up is something that I'm struggling with currently still. This thing happened about 5/6 years ago while I was in Year 8 (8th grade) I believe, basically my friend gave me a pair of trousers to wear after school and asked if I wanted to buy them off of him because they didn't fit him, I took them to try them on, played football and then ending up ripping them. I went to my friend's house after and then received a phone call from a bunch of my friends saying that they'd been up to my house to tell my Mum that I owed my friend money - they were with another guy that was kinda known as the biggest and hardest guy, and because I refused to give my friend the money for the trousers, they got this guy to confront me and then threaten me. 
The next day I've gave my friend the money and all of us just laughed it off, even the guy that confronted me. We've all been friends for many years, and pretty regularly go out together, whether it be drinking, playing football, and we're even planning holidays together. 

For some reason this scenario entered my head again many months ago and has been eating me away ever since but I really can't pinpoint why, especially considering we're all very good friends now, the guy apologised to me and it was so long ago and pathetic and meaningless. I actually saw the guy that confronted me a short time after it first re-entered my mind and I brought it up &amp; we all laughed it off again and he hugged me and apologised again. But still it eats me away, I feel like I need to get him back in some way for making me feel so low but obviously that isn't something I want to do because he's my friend, it was so long ago and all in all it's just a pathetic and petty thing. 

As I say this has only began to really eat at me in the last few months, for the months and years after it happened it didn't even cross my mind so I'm very confused as to why it's bugging me like it is. Can anybody explain this?

Could this be some type of anxiety or something? It seems like I overthink everything I do now, like when I'm walking in the streets I sometimes feel like I've looked at someone in the wrong way (even though I definitely haven't) and I began to panic wondering what they might think of me etc etc. 

Appreciate any help guys, apologises for the long post. ",28Mar2017,1
45,"Can you contribute your story alongside others who have been/ are going through recovery?
 
I am developing a storytelling and mental health platform with the ultimate aim of curating a museum exhibition. Soul relics Museum is a platform for people to read and tell stories of mental health through objects that help them connect or express to a present or past experience they have had with their mental health.
 
It’s a unique and creative idea to help people come forward and share with others what mental health problems have been like for them and a safe and constructive way to read of others experiences while being brave enough to share your own. Together, we can create a collective voice in raising awareness and education on mental health!
 
All you need to do to help is to take a look ((http://soulrelicsmuseum.me) and write a short personal story (http://soulrelicsmuseum.me/Contribute.html)!

Let me know if you have any thoughts! 

With Solidarity,
Van
