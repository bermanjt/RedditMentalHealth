0,"Recently, I don't know how I'd describe my current setup. I'm not out of school, but I've been having some issues and I think I might need another opinion or two.

Here's the issue, of course I SHOULD get help for the things in my life, I'm just not into going into the hospital for days on end, as accepting I needed help last time led to that. I truly think I might be okay as well, but I like at my life sometimes and go ""fuck man"".

Another issue is the substance use I've been apart of the last few years. Going into high school, I was definitely experimenting alot. 
I don't think it's worth going into, but trust me, I'm pretty into drugs, no jib or down though.  I don't want my parents learning all of this, even though it's caused a decent amount of trauma to me. I can't see my parents feeling lesser. 

The thing is that I know that ""if you think you should be asking for help, you need it"" but I'm unsure weather to just continue the way I'm going, slowly getting better and growing up, or take that step 

When I was fourteen, I was monitored for 3 days straight in a hospital room with no screws after telling my parents I believed i was depressed and had mad an attempt on my life in the past stupidly. I'm in no danger of suicide.

-heavy drug use 
-often not eating or sleeping enough 
-poor social skills sometimes 
-no violent tendencies, but sometimes overuse of phrases around disliking myself
-my room actually should be condemned. It's awful. 

I'm scared to face the music, or maybe I'm over thinking this because of the whole situation. 

I just need any opinions really...has anyone been through this pride/unhonest  thing? Should I trust myself? Or risk going back to hospital and losing everything the last 3 years...thank you in advance. I really appreciate it",20Oct2017,1
1,"Today, I had the worst day I've had in forever.

I had 3 midterm exams today all at once and only had half an hour of sleep to go on, I was late and had my study time cut short because the security guards decided to harass me for no reason, my professor isn't concerned for me and thinks that I'm just a bad person...

And when I get home, my mother decides to make me have a mental breakdown by putting a gory image in my head. The resulting breakdown causes her and my older brother not to attempt to help me, but bill me as a crazy and angry person, and urges me to move out of her house, because to her, I'm a naturally terrible person who needs to stop existing.

I don't have anyone I can trust, my own family doesn't give a damn about me or even want me, and I'm sitting here starting to go insane. I don't know if there's a way out of this, but at least I'm fortunate enough to know that nobody in my life wants to help me through it.",20Oct2017,23

But I've been getting huge depressive episodes and I've been really suicidal recently. wouldn't do it, but the thought is still there. And sometimes I'll get like random bursts of energy where I'll want to bash my head into walls and rip my hair out. And l don't understand what that urge is. I don't like taking meds. It makes me feel like I'm some looney bin. I don't think that about others though, just myself. I've been thinking of talking to my psychiatrist about maybe getting medical marijuana.

6,"Long vague story, probably no point reading
For years I've thought that I have depression or something and in 2015 I went to see my 1st psychiatrist. I was cutting on and off. Was quickly put on depakene but wasn't told about diagnosis. Months later when I had to fill up some forms, my doctor wrote bipolar 2 and cptsd in it. So I assume that was my diagnosis. I see her for almost a year. Then I switch to my new doctor when I moved back home. After months of sessions, my new doctor told me I didn't have bipolar, and took me off my meds. And I admit I don't really fit the description. And soon it became more clear that I didn't have a diagnosible mental illness. I just relate so much to things I see and hear about mental illness that I thought I'm sick too. I'm still seeing my doctor every month but I always think I shouldn't be there if I don't have a diagnosis. I have little issues here and there not enough for a diagnosis.(I have mild symptoms of this and that, not enough for diagnosis bad enough to be a problem, sometimes I get fed-up trying to prove it (most of the time to myself) that I need help, somehow mental health is like some rich men's club that I try hard to enter)  

Now the part where I need help and advice.  I have some friends who has depression, and they are doing multiple things, studying, working part time, have relationships. They have dreams they have aims and they work hard. While on the other side, I don't suffer as deeply but I have no purpose, I can't handle studying or working, I drop out, and I resigned, now I stay at home doing nothing. I would expect that people with depression suffers more and would have more difficulty but why am I worse? I feel even shittier knowing that people who have more difficulty are keeping their lives together but I'm not. I feel useless.
Now that I've dropped out and resigned, I have isolated myself from all stressors. I'm feeling fine but I'm not moving forward. I am stuck in my room, not for terribly depressing emotions and thoughts but because I don't know what I want to do. I can't think about my future, every time I try, my mind would suddenly get cloudy and I give up. I'm fine other times, I am mostly floating in a bubble, watching videos all the time, and avoiding facing myself and my future. I just forget that I have to decide my own life. Help please. I wanted to talk to friends about this but I can't because this would probably be insulting to them (the only 2 friends I have, have depression)",20Oct2017,1

11,"Ever since I started taking college courses, my self-esteem has been at an all-time low. My grades are fine, a B average student, I work two jobs which usually amount to 25-ish hours a week in total, but I also take fewer credit hours than most. I'm constantly concerning myself with how much work I'm doing. No matter what I do I can't shake this feeling that I'm a lazy fuck who is letting people down. I can't shake this feeling that I'm constantly spitting in the face of everyone who has faith in me.

I can only think about the few great people I have in my life, and continually think that I am nothing but an emotional leech on them. I rely on others to keep my sanity, and I probably would be in way deeper an emotional pit if it wasn't for a very close friend of mine.

Not only that, but I also can't help but compare myself to such people. My friends go to more prestigious schools than me, they make way more friends than I do and have way more drive to do things in life. I feel like I'm going to be outgrown eventually. I feel like everyone I need in my life is going to drift away, moving on to better things. I fear that they'll meet more people that can replace me. I know for certain that my best friend will always have good friends, he's just that kind of person, but I'm *not*. I won't ever find people that can replace the friends that I have now, and I know that for a fact. I can't even really put it into words how bad this can make me feel. This terrible combination of ""You're not good enough for your loved ones."" and ""Your loved ones don't even really need you like you need them."" 

Whenever I'm left alone with my thoughts, I can't help but drift to these horrible scenarios that play on my worst insecurities. I find myself constantly fearing that I will eventually die alone, with only the memories of those who have long since forgotten me accompanying me to my grave.

I hate it so much. I don't want to feel like this. I feel like *shit* when I'm like this. I wish I could tell myself that everything is gonna be okay, and no matter how much a part of me *deep inside* knows that I'm probably overexaggerating, I can't seem to shake these fucking awful moods.

I can't tell if I'm overthinking and making my emotional state worse, or if there is something wrong with me that I need to talk to someone about.

Edit: I have no clue why this was labeled as an ""announcement"", and I'm sorry if it's not supposed to be that.",20Oct2017,2
12,"I stopped taking medications about two years ago because my mood and life had improved to the point that i didnt need them and i had been wanting this to happen for so long. Side effects are a bitch after all. Anyway, things were all fine, relationship with my mom had improved and my biological family seemed to care about me genuinely. I started senior year in september of 2016, the most difficult year of high school even though i had more than enough credits both college and high school (i was dual enrolled sophomore year) to graduate, I wanted to graduate with the friends ive had since middle school. November 1st, I get blown up with phone calls (i dont have my notifications on so i didnt see) i answered and all i could make out is that my close friend had killed herself with her boyfriend. Whether it was from the shock or disbelief or possibly even false confidence that i could handle it, it wasnt until the next day that it really sank in. I went to school the next day and you could hear everyone screaming. The teachers couldnt function. It was surreal. I became too depressed to deal with school and my grades started slipping. I isolated myself from the internet and media since it was the ""big story"" going around. I refused to be put back on medication so i opted for therapy. This seemed to strike a bit of hope into the situation. Until it happened again three weeks later. It was like an endless cycle of suicides of people i called friends. Even after i graduated in may i recieved calls from family and friends of the recently deceased. I cut myself off from everyone there in hopes that i could focus on getting better and not being surrounded by depression and for a while it worked. But now its fall and november 1st is soon and im not getting better. Does it take longer than a year for symptoms of ptsd to subside? I cant see or smell anything related to fall without falling into a crippling depression and a sense of panic or anxiety. Will this go away if I give it more time?",20Oct2017,1

18,"Hello Reddit,

So about an hour ago my brother woke me up asking me to drive him to the ER because he thinks he broke his foot... Kicking his car because he was angry that he couldn't buy cigarettes. Just the other day he broke his Xbox controller and coffee table because he got so mad at his game (has a history of doing this.) He's often broken things because he gets so angry.

He also has manic depression and is suicidal. We are fairly certain he may have bipolar disorder. But he refuses help or treatment of any sort.

My mom wants to admit him into a psych ward. We've been dealing with this for too many years... But we'd rather try to convince him to get help... Does anyone have any advice on how to maybe convince someone to see a therapist? To at least try?",20Oct2017,2

Now at 18, I'm on Sertraline for my anxiety and depression. And I guess they work but I've also changed my circumstances so my life is generally better now.

My only issue now are my intense dreams. I've had them my whole life and I haven't seen anyone about them yet. My dreams are upsetting and realistic. When I was younger they were pretty realistic but there were monsters, so not that realistic. But now that I'm older they're extremely realistic and gruesome; they range from people leaving me to me killing people or other violent acts. The scenarios are almost my biggest fears but I don't understand why I dream about it because I don't necessarily think about negative things during the day anymore, just a normal girl at uni.

Now these tests cost too much in my state and as a broke student with no health insurance I cannot afford them. What would she determine from these tests and are they really necessary?

Meditation stresses me out and honestly makes my anxiety worse. I feel like I honestly may need some meds.

I stopped eating a lot. I fasted. I was still overweight  and I hated myself. I lost some weight and I was able to feel my collarbone and my hips, and then I couldn't stop touching them. Like I was proud. 

I wanted to join the army, so I took it farther and exercised more than I should've. I tried so hard to lose weight so I could get in, only to figure out that self harm scars would most likely disqualify me. 

I was torn, and beyond upset. I started binging, but only on the things that I wanted to. I started skipping dinner so I could eat other food. I ended up ordering sweets online so I can eat them secretly.

30,"I feel seriously stuck in life because I confine myself to a comfort zone. When I consider things which could theoretically significantly improve my situation, I often feel a painful tense negative feeling which motivates avoidance of these things, and I get thoughts about why doing that would be a bad idea.

I don't think this is anxiety. If I take a benzodiazepine it does somewhat dull the feeling, but the action I'm considering still seems seriously wrong. I could maybe compare it to being near the edge of a cliff or beside high speed traffic. A normal person would have a drive to avoid injury or death even if their anxiety was chemically suppressed. I have that drive, but I also have a very similar drive to avoid all sorts of things that could theoretically help me.


Sometimes I get very brief periods of motivation for these things, but this may be seconds to hours, and seems too short to accomplish anything.

I've tried to help this with a variety of recreational drugs, especially psychedelics, and some medications, but nothing seems to be a significant help. It might bring up a bit more of those periods of motivation or make them last a bit longer, but that's still far from sufficient to actually accomplish anything major with it feeling like a good thing to do.  I also note that non-drug activities like going for a bike ride or walk brings that up, but those benefits also don't seem to be enough and pass.

There have been various activities which I avoided before and which are in my comfort zone now, but these are fairly minor things. The avoidance of the really significant things seems overpowering.

I would like to somehow decrease this avoidance and be able to do things feeling like I'm doing a good thing. But past experiences make me wonder if there is any way at all to make this change. Can anything help or do I just need to somehow force myself to do things even though they seem wrong? I'm afraid that if I did the latter I would end up in a situation in life which I very much don't want, and wouldn't be any better off.

Two things could be helping maintain this avoidance. One is excessive use of the Internet, to the point where it seems like an addiction. The other is a tendency for being at home to make me feel bad and destroy my motivation.

The cause of this was probably upbringing and related trauma. My mother was very critical of most things I did or considered doing. Also, she threw terrible temper tantrums on countless occasions, including a bunch of times when I was expanding my comfort zone. Probably getting away from her would be helpful, but this problem makes getting away seem practically impossible. Psychiatrists thought I was just mildly depressed, but I think it has to be something more, maybe C-PTSD from the trauma.

I've tried cognitive therapy, but for major things the avoidance is just too overpowering. Attempts to change it were highly unpleasant and fruitless, and I would compare it to something ridiculous like trying to stop Titanic from sinking by bailing water out with a bucket. So I kind of hate cognitive therapy because of this, though thinking about it now I suppose it might help where avoidance is much weaker.",20Oct2017,5
31,"I am [27F]. I grew up a heavy over thinker with a HUGE imagination, and while this has helped me in my career, it hasn't helped with my mental health. I've struggled with mild anxiety for as long as I can remember, but have worked hard to adapt and live my life with it. 



For about 6 months now, for the first time in my life, everything seems... almost perfect. I am in a strong, loving relationship, and I just landed my dream job. My debt is almost paid off (finally!) I'm healthy, family and friends are great, etc. As an anxious pessimist, you'll understand when, while I am happy, I am constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop... but it hasn't yet.



The guilt started a few weeks ago in a bizarre way. I was running along my favourite trail, when a 20 dollar bill caught my eye. I looked around to see if anyone had dropped it, but there was no one around. The trail was pretty secluded, and the bill was crumpled and sort of kicked into the brush on the side. I figured it had been there a while. I pocketed it, and continued my run. 


I don't believe in taking what isn't mine, and if I knew who belonged to the 20 I absolutely would have returned it. But hey, in my years I've found coins and small bills abandoned in public and scooped them up not thinking much of it (I'm sure many of us have), but for some reason picking up that 20 FLOODED me with guilt.



I dwelled on it the days following, suddenly paranoid it was a morals test.. like the 20 had been placed there to test me. It was a bad omen. Bad karma I'd brought myself. 


I didn't feel comfortable having it in my wallet, so I ended up donating it to charity to ease my mind... but the guilt didn't subside.



The guilt moved away from being about the 20 and simply became a constant feeling. Lately, it's like I'm terrified every move i make isn't ""morally correct"" and that I'm bringing on bad karma. 



In analyzing myself (ha) I am wondering if this is my fear of screwing up the great things happening in my life... so perhaps some paranoia is setting in. But it's extremely overwhelming, and as someone who already overthinks, you can imagine it's consuming.

32,"Let me start this by saying that I fully, wholeheartedly believe in the benefits of meditation. I imagine it must be wonderful if you can quiet your mind and feelings and just sit there enjoying the silence. Let me also say that I know meditation is a skill - not something you can ""just do"" but something you need to practice and work at.

Now, whenever I try and sit down and meditate my anxiety starts growing. I can be fine before, then I sit down and slowly it just rises and rises and keeps rising until I can't can't take it anymore and get up and distract myself, and then I need time to ""come down"" again, that can be minutes or hours. So even if I'm feeling relatively fine beforehand seemingly if I try and clear my mind what my mind actually does is freak the fuck out. And I've had people tell me I should just ""observe"" my anxiety and ""accept it"" (blah blah major eyeroll) but it's absolutely impossible for me in that moment to do that, especially since I know that if I just go and do something else I'll start feeling better. I've really tried to stick through it before and I ended up almost relapsing into self harm because I felt so horrible.

My question is does anyone experience the same? Have you found a solution? Am I just doing something wrong? Does anyone else have ideas for solutions or any suggestions at all?

37,"I apologize in advance if this post is too long -- but please bear with me, &amp; thank you for taking the time to read.

Back in June of this year, I seemed to experience some sort of breakdown. I was so paralyzed in stress and anxiety that I completely couldn't function at work or home. I ended up quitting my job and had to rest at home. During this time, I also had this feeling that I could lash out at anyone -- like my manager, but mostly my parents (who I live with). I felt boiling anger and resentment, which I'll explain more below.

To give some context -- I am 24 years old and have lived at home since graduating college 2 years ago. I've overall had a happy upbringing, but did feel a bit directionless and depressed during college (some things happened that affected me). I felt pretty low and depressed about moving back home upon graduating, but didn't know what else to do.

I ended up taking a job in my hometown, which was a good opportunity, even though I don't feel like I fit in my town and always wanted to be in the city. I don't really have many friends around here. In terms of my parents, they're immigrants from Europe and have always put some pressure on my sister and me to succeed in life, so I've never told them about my struggles with depression.

---------------

Fast forward to June this year, I had this breakdown and continue to be at home. As I mentioned above, I felt an intense feeling of resentment and anger directed mostly towards my parents. I felt like I was sick of everyone in my life and tired of pretending I was ok and happy (I always felt this pressure to be the ""good child"" in my parent's eyes). I specifically felt resentment towards my mom for the emotional invalidation I've gotten from her over the years. 

To go along with these feelings, I felt CRIPPLING anxiety and had intense panic attacks, and this urge to escape and like I was going to absolutely lose it. I kept telling myself, ""Just burst out and express your pain/anger! Stop holding back from your parents!"" But the anxiety was so bad, I couldn't do it no matter how much I tried. It felt like I was going to go OUT OF CONTROL, which scared me.

--------------

Over the following months since then, I feel pretty numbed out, depressed I guess. Like I feel very isolated from the world and nothing interests me at all. I'm seeing a psychiatrist, so hopefully that will help.

My concerns looking back on all this is: 
-Why do I feel numb now and is it because of those intense feelings I sensed? 
-How do I get back to feeling like myself and normal and a part of the world?

Sometimes I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking down emotionally, or having a meltdown? Like there's something deep within me that needs to come out or fall apart?

38,"Hi everyone,

I am a 20-year-old male currently in my third year of college. However, I still do not have my driver's license or really know how to drive a car. It's just driving makes me anxious. This is why I put off getting my license for four years. When my dad tried to teach me how to drive a few years ago, he would yell at me, criticize me, grab the wheel, and I felt like he was rushing me. He even asked me, ""Do you want to drive or use public transportation? You have to make a decision because I'm going to give up. It didn't take this long with your siblings."" It really brought my confidence down knowing that my dad was going to give up teaching me how to drive because he felt like I wasn't improving. Mind you, at this point I only had seven hours of practice. I stopped driving for a few months after this. Eventually, my father asked me, ""Do you want to drive again?"". I guess his feelings subsided, and he was willing to teach me again. But, I refused. A year later, I started driving with my brother. I actually wasn't doing a bad job driving with my brother, but the previous bad experiences with my dad haunted me, and I stopped practicing with him. It's just I never felt comfortable.

I just find it so irritating that I can't do a simple everyday task that millions of people do. I am sick of having to rely on other people to drive me around. I have to wake up at 6:00am every day so that my dad can drop me off at college before he goes to work. I feel bad, because sometimes he's late to work. It's so embarrassing and inconvenient that I have to rely on my parents and siblings to drive me to and from college like a child. Most students drive themselves. Most people my age are driving. It's so frustrating seeing little 16-year-olds driving around, and I can't manage to do it. It's embarrassing when my mother or father talk to family members on the phone telling them how they have to take me to and from school. They ask ""Is he driving yet?"" And my parents have to come up with an excuse. It is expected at my age to have a driver's license and to be driving. Everyone says driving is really easy. I wish I could see it that way. I wish I didn't have this problem. I just want to learn how to drive so I can have the freedom to go anywhere I want to go at any time without having to rely on others. I really want to drive, but I always think what could go wrong. ""What if I get into an accident? What if I get lost? What if I hit someone or something? Driving on the freeway at high speeds."" I do not want to give up on driving, because I would not be able to do the things that I would like to do with my life.

Sorry for the long post, but I just needed to vent about this. If any of you can give me any advice on how I can overcome this fear, I would really appreciate it. I am at my wit's end. I am so desperate to get over this. Not being able to drive is ruining my life!",20Oct2017,1
39,Constant vivid dreams at night. Waking up feeling worse.,20Oct2017,5
40,"So I'm halfway through my first semester of college (USA) and I'm 3 hours away from home. I miss my friends, family, and my boyfriend who are all back home. I have no friends here, back home and throughout high school I had so many friends but now I can barely even make one. I'm so alone here and I just want to drop out because I'm so isolated and miserable.

I can't sleep anymore, I toss and turn for at least 2 hours before I can fall asleep and then I wake up again in the middle of the night and do the same thing. Then I nap for extended hours during the day, I never used to be like this. And when I come home and spend the night with my boyfriend I sleep safely like a baby, I don't know why I'm like this.

I also don't eat anymore. I had such a big appetite before I came here but now I barely eat anything. It's painful for me to get up and make myself eat something. And I have a dining plan so it's not like theres a shortage of food here.. I just have no motivation to eat anything.

It's worse here when I stay on the weekends because it really solidifies the fact that I'm a loser here now. Im not used to being alone like this. I tell my family and friends I'm having a great time but really I spend weekends bawling my eyes out in my dorm room waiting for the next time I can go home or my boyfriend/friends visit. It hurts to get out of bed.

I just feel so trapped and completely alone. I hate living now. The days move by so agonizingly slow and I wake up and immediately want it to be night again. These are supposed to be the best years of my life and I just want them over with.. What is wrong with me?

And the no friends part is just making it worse. I talk to people in my classes and I've joined a few clubs but nothing has came out of it. Everyone here already had their friend group before school started and its very cliquey here. I just want one friend, I've never felt like such a worthless person in my life before. There has to be someone who wants to be my friend, I had plenty back home..

I sound so desperate writing this but I'm not sure what else to do.. If someone thinks they may know whats wrong with me or they think they can give me advice then please, please comment..",20Oct2017,2
41,"(I do have psychologist, but I still ask here)
Edit: help with diagnoses.
I am completely lost at who the (pardon my French) fuck am I.

Let's start: I had been diagnosed as ADHD and Asperger's as a kid. I had been in risperidon for emotional instability and agression. 

The ADHD diagnosis has been removed years ago, and it has turned that I am in fact Bipolar 1. I also have frequent panic attacks for no reason whatsoever. 
I have Fantasy Prone personality, I spend 50-80% in paracosm/fantasy world.

This would fit with my personality issues to schizoid disorder, but I lack feelings like love or shame, I am manipulative and I don't have much, if any, of empathy left. This gives a strong indication for sociopathy but as far as I know sociopaths cannot have anxiety nor fantasy prone personality.

Nothing of this harms me much, but I want to be able to understand myself as good as I understand other people.
Ps. I also have a lot of forced thoughts which do not disturb me much and are very violent (I also like fire, violence and other shady shit).

Thank you for your time.",20Oct2017,6
42,"I have been out of work for 12 years due to Agoraphobia and Major Depression. I got on Disability in 2011. 

I have made some progress due to therapy and meds. I no longer cut myself and don't have as many thoughts of suicide. But I don't want to deal with my agoraphobia in therapy. 

This makes me feel ashamed or guilty since that is one of the reasons I am on disability. Should I feel guilty for not wanting to work on something in therapy? ",20Oct2017,2
43,"I've always been an incredibly passionate individual with no shortage of empathy. I've always enjoyed writing, reading, discovering new music, etc. However, after struggling with this, I've found myself largely incapable of reconnecting with those emotions.

I would say I'm well onto the path to recovery with regards to depersonalization. I don't necessarily feel anxious nor disconnected from myself at all times. I'm confident that I will triumph over this. I already feel better each passing day. It's just the emotional detachment that has bothered me perhaps more than anything else.

Do I just need to give it time? Is there anything in particular I could do to accelerate this process?

All of your answers are appreciated. Thanks!",20Oct2017,2
