0,"I hate him with a passion but started to think recently  he actually might be mentally ill and suddenly it takes on a very sad angle and I'm starting to feel a bit bad for him. 

He seems to not be resilient and reacting to all the stress the job brings and acting out in response which is very dangerous to us all for someone in his position.

Any psychiatrists on here ? Could he be genuinely  mentally ill ? If he's just an asshole he's an awful human being but he seems to be increasingly paranoid which is starting to make me concerned. 

Can a health professional order he be evaluated ?",17Mar2017,0

2,"Whenever I stand for too long I get this horrible anxious knotting feeling in my head (especially ears) and stomach. Similar to if you're standing on the edge of tall building and falling. 

This has never been an issue with me until a few weeks of living in my current place with my fianc√© and his parents which is about 3000 miles away from my previous home. I've been living here for three months and it is very comfortable socially and I feel very safe and loved 
I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and anxiety disorder about three years ago. I've been on Prozac, lamictal, and hydroxyzine (for sleep and nausea) consistently for about a year now and it has been working great. 
I hardly ever drink and very very rarely smoke. 

Can anyone please help me understand more about what this is and how I can help it?

3,"I have looked through symptoms of OCD online and the DSM, and I've noticed I do have some symptoms and behaviors of the disorder, I don't have all the necessary components for the full disorder (I know you can't self-diagnose something like this, I was just wondering if it was worth going to see a therapist about it).

I don't always have these feelings, they just come on randomly. Say, sometimes i'd accidently touch the counter with my left hand. I'll want to then touch the counter with my right hand to feel 'even'. I'll do this if i'm adjusting my glasses or accidently kicked something. It isn't all the time. But, I don't have a problem with holding my phone in one hand and using it, or a TV remote, that doesn't feel weird to me. 

Whenever i'm home alone and leave the house, I sometimes check multiple times if I turned off the stove, locked the door, stuff like that. Even if I know I turned it off, i'll always check again. I always hate leaving my phone or laptop charging overnight because of worry it'll catch fire (i'll only leave it charging if it's plugged into a powerstrip with a surge protector). 

In my kitchen the radio, oven and microwave are all next to each other against the same wall, and they all have digital clocks. When i'm leaving, or just hanging in the kitchen, if I look at the radio clock on the right, i'll want to look at the other two to feel 'even'. I'll do this before leaving the house sometimes because if I don't, something might happen. But if I just look at the oven clock, I don't need to look at the other ones because it's the one in the middle so it's already 'even'. 

As a kid, when my mom baked holiday cookies she would keep them in the garage because there was more room out there to store things, and I never liked to eat them because I thought someone could come in and poison them because the door to the garage would only sometimes be locked, so anyone could have theoretically came in and tampered with them. I grew out of that though and I stopped worrying about that as I got older. 

I know I have some Obsessive and Compulsive tendencies an behaviors, but all of the readings i've looked at say that it has to have a large negative impact your quality of living/hinders how you go about your day to qualify as OCD. I don't miss out on things  in life because of these feelings though. Sometimes i'll feel uneasy when going about my day in certain situations when I don't do what I feel I need to do (that has to do more with my general anxiety I think) but after a while I just forget about it and I see that nothing bad happened, so I guess that's kind of like doing your own behavioral-exposure therapy. 

So I guess, what i'm asking is that is there a point in going to see a therapist if these feelings aren't negatively impacting your life and you're managing?",17Mar2017,6

5,hi im 20 my name is .. well cant really say it on here and i dont want to but idk whats wrong with me. I know im lonely but I used to have so many friends... thing is i still have all those friends but i moved away close by but i dont see them everyday like i did. it becomes once a week or so i see familiar faces. once i moved away i only really hung out with maybe 3 different people... and we all have very different schedules ... anyways theres that so yes im pretty lonely most of the time.. on the weekends i drive home to see my family but then my parents end up making fun of me that i dont see any friends or hang out on the weekends with people so i end up being in my room alone. and i dont like to say that i self harm but i do ... i bang my arms on things to get bruises.. i bang my head to get bruises there too... i think i do it to get attention because i dont like the pain and throbbing i go through.... its very easy for me to cry ..... i dont know whats wrong with me ...  i keep crying . does this post even make sense? i know it doesnt but i dont know how to fix it.. my grades dropped drastically i use drugs to feel better but then the next day it just goes back who do i go to ........... my mom thinks  im crazy because ill start crying just by her trying to ask whats wrong with me.  i dont even know where im going with this but no one wants to help me ... no one wants to hear poor lonely me just crying and my pathetic problems. after class i go to my room because i have no friends to hang with .... i want to see la and the differnt things to do (i live here) but i dont want to do it alone.. or always be alone and have people stare at me.... im even going to coachella with a friend who i doubt even wants to go with me anymore because last time i spoke with her she was already trying to go with other people even though  i got a ticket because of her... i just dont think anyone cares about me... but whenever i see people im automatically the happiest person and thats all they see. they see the happy me because sad me is me 95% of the time.,18Mar2017,2

7,"I have had low self esteem my whole life since middle school and I find that I automatically jump to negative conclusions about what people think of something I said or did. Now that I have become more aware of this issue, I believe it has created a self-fulfilling prophecy for me over the years by acting in ways that made people like me less only because I believed that they disliked me.

Now I am in a fraternity at my university and I am feeling the same way all over again; something I was trying to move on from the start. I feel left out and feel like my efforts to mold into the group have failed. I am just looking to work towards shifting this whole unconscious negative mindset that is limiting in my ability to be socially content and happy. The question is how? It seems like nothing works no matter who I am with or where I am. Some days are so good that I feel on top of the world and invincible to any kind of negative force but that is very rare.

10,"I am bisexual and have BPD.

Like some bi people (I'm a 19yr old girl), I find that my sexuality ""ebbs and flows"", as in, it's centred on whichever special person that I find attractive at that particular time, not really anything to do with random people, so it doesn't feel like I have ""general attraction to both guys and girls"".And, because I have BPD, I have a shifting sense of identity AND i fall into really intense, deep infatuations. This means that at times I feel 100% lesbian and at times I feel 100% straight, depending on if I like a girl or guy. This in itself is fine and sexuality can be fluid, but I'm not a mentally ""normal"" person who can think, ""hey, I'm bisexual but I like a guy right now""..for me, my current feelings always COMPLETELY fill my identity, and seem to carry a lot of pain and sentimental significance to me.


I had a few months where I thought I was a lesbian and convinced myself that I'd never been attracted to guys and that ""this"" was the True Me, just because I was crushing on ONE girl at that point. This was extremely difficult for me, since I'm still not overly happy with not being str8, so instead of dealing with being bi, which I AM an have always been, I was suddenly ""aware"" that I was gay and ""had always been gay"", just based on the strong feelings I had then. This BPD stuff is crazy.. my identity suddenly became ""closet lesbian"" to me and I spend 2hrs crying every day about how I'd have to deal with it... all because I liked one girl during those months.

A few months down the line, I fell hardcore for a guy and honestly, genuinely believed ""I'm straight now, thank god, this is easier!!!"""". I KNEW that, logically, I had previously liked girls AND guys in this intense way, so I was bi ""by definition"", but  the single crush I had on this guy felt **so strong to me at the time that I just dumped my old identity**. Instead, the identity of ""straight girl"" consumed me and became all that I related to. This is my issue..  my life is a constant stream of being deeply affected by crazily intense emotions, and feeling like they are showing me the ""true me"" bc they are SO strong that they must mean something profound.

I was just wondering whether any of you can relate to any of this super-convincing, emotional insanity, especially to do with something already-confusing and quite fluid like bisexuality? When I type stuff out, I realise how much BPD affects me. I feel like I live my life in intense, almost drug-experience-like chapters. Sexuality-based examples are particularly crazy, e.g. four months of ""I'm gay, have never even liked a guy"""" back to ""I'm straight, I don't relate to LGBT people at all!!!"". 

It also fascinates me bc I love psychology. I think it's just that we feel more emotions with every experience, so those emotions wipe out any previous identity we related to, and suddenly we feel that we are ""totally"" a certain way and ""have been this way since childhood"".Ôªø

This does cause me a lot of issues, though. I look back at the last 5 years of my life, I can clearly split that period of time into distinct, strongly emotional 6ish month ""Phases"". Each phase is v unique and characterised by a particular person I was obsessing over, something I thought about myself etc.

So, are any of you like me?",18Mar2017,8

14,"I have been dealing with severe depression since I was a child and anxiety since high school.  
Throughout the years I have been striving to find ways to lessen the symptoms of the two illnesses, but this isn't as easy as it seems.  
I am 22 now and have attempted to die by suicide three times throughout my life.   During my attempts I realized that ending my own life would just hurt my family,  and luckily I was able to prevent my attempts from being successful.  
I have been prescribed Paxil by itself, then Seroquil was added, followed by Ativan, and currently I am only on Effexor.

I have overcome drug addiction in the past year.  I used drugs to cope,  and although they did help me be more productive,  I have learned to be even more productive without the daily use of cocaine. I indulged daily, doing 1+ grams and after two years of this decided to stop to see how my mental health would benefit.  
I have done it several times a month in the past 12 but nowhere near my past daily intake.  It's all about progress, right? 

I felt it was necessary to include information about this struggle because it does impact mental health.  
Since I decided to quit I have found my head to be more clear,  but I still find myself becoming suddenly overwhelmed with despair and hopelessness, tears, and the urge to flee wherever I am or ditch anyone in my presence. I experience this several times a week,  often for no reason or occurring completely out of context.  It does impact my day and what I am able to find the courage to do afterwards.  The duration of these experiences could last ten minutes to a full day.

I often act in a ""I hate you /  don't leave me""  manner toward my partner.  I care about him but my attitude toward him can change momentarily like a light switch, sometimes for no reason. 
This hurts and confuses me as well as it does him. 


These frequent encounters make my days difficult. 
I have tried behaving and thinking positively,  meditation,  counseling,   and drastic lifestyle changes when I have a lot of these episodes close together ( multiple times daily,  for a month or more). 

I don't know what genuine happiness feels like.  I am numb or I am deeply sad. I isolate myself from others because I don't like my friends to see this happen to me so often.  My parents have called me spoiled because I do not express my joy for their efforts, although I tell them how much I appreciate everything they do. I could win the lottery and react with  ""that's cool"". 

I attend one session a week with a therapist who uses the cognitive behavioral approach in her practice. I am comfortable with her and I complete the activities she suggests. Hopefully CBT will pay off,  this is my 6th week. 

I live in Newfoundland and the health care system is lacking the attention and proper needs for those who are battling with mental illness.   I have thought about admitting myself to the hospital several times because I feel I just cannot make it through another day. 
Several times I have contributed GPs and mental health professionals about this and they simply upped the dose of whatever medication I was on. 
They've treated me as an individual who has no problems or concerns besides addiction, and tell me I have to ""do this""  for myself,  and sent me on my way,  with no further help.  
They look down upon you if you are open about addiction. 
My cries for help have been ignored.  Employers do not treat you the same if you need time off due to mental illness. Doctors will prescribe you anything just to make a pay cheque and see more patients in a day than listen and properly care for your needs.

This is my first post on reddit and this is how I chose to introduce myself and create awareness for mental health needs in Newfoundland.

20,"I'm not sure who to go to for all my issues, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and recently started hearing whispering/voices in my head. My close friends all tell me to go tell my parents and get it sorted out with someone who can help me. My problem is my father does not care about me at all and my mother says to come to her for help and what not, but when I do come to her for help she insults me and mocks me for it. (she still will take me to someone who can help me). She makes the process of ""fixing myself"" even more difficult. When she is unhappy or pissed off she especially uses my problems as a way for her to feel better. How can I find help without the interference of my mother?

I am engaged to a wonderful girl who lives 3700 miles away, and we are due to be married in June after 7 months of dating and a year of knowing each other.

She is my best friend, and I can't feel that anymore. Everyone says I'm fine and that it's depression, but I want Reddit's point of view.

I get crazy butterflies from her, but they come and go.

I cannot lose this girl to my mental health. She means the world to me. I used to be so worried about her going places or meeting new people.

it's like I spend ages recharging then instead of using my energy sensibly I spend it all in one go and then get completely drained.
