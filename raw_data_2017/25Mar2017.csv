0,"(Sorry this might be long.) My whole life I have been told that I was ""a worrier""- by my teachers, friends and family. I worry about things that I know I shouldn't worry about but I can't help it. For years (and still now) I would try to sleep and I wouldn't be able to because I would focus on my breathing and feel like if I didn't focus on it I would just stop, and would spend the whole night panicking and trying to breathe- and its so difficult to breathe when that happens. Even though I know that this is completely stupid and illogical since breathing happens involuntarily it still happens. And I'll even worry during the day that I won't be able to sleep at night because of this making me more scared to go to sleep. Every day I am exauhsted. I am having constant headaches (i thought it was dehydration but turns out its not) and my whole body just feels tense and sore. I will check every door in my house to see if it is locked multiple times in a row and when I leave to go to school and am on  my way walking to the subway I will turn around and go back home again to check if the door is really locked. I will literally cry at any given moment and anything will reduce me to tears. I can be downstairs brushing my teeth and my brother will walk in and for some reason it will scare me and I will feel like I have to cry. I know this is stupid but I can't help it. I am constantly pulling and twirling around my hair and my friends make fun of me for it and my parents scream about it telling me its weird and to not do that in public but I don't even realize Im doing it. I hate everything about my self and the way I act and I have thoughts about dying and not go out to social events for a few months but the next week I will feel beautiful  and love my life and want to go out and party. Everything irritates me. Now here's the stuff about my parents. I get really good grades in school and I have a job and I play piano (because my parents have made since I was 8-I'm currently 17 btw). I really hate sports (my parents used to force me to do track and field and cross country when I was younger and for weeks even months before I would worry nonstop about my races to the point that I tried to quit and when I actually would my parents would make me go back the next day and rejoin) and my parents constantly scream at me and get mad at me since I don't participate in any school sports. They also are mad since I'm not in any school clubs but nothing interests me (I'm not trying to be rude it really does) and I'm too scared to join. My parents say I'm lazy and don't do anything that helps anyone else and only care about myself- they say I only go to work because it benefits me but they have been nagging at me to get a job as long as I could remember (even when I was not legally allowed to work)....but once I got a job when I was 16 they didn't care and said all I cared about was money. They are very strict on me but not on my brother who doesn't give a shit about anything (fails his classes because he doesn't try) but plays sports. when I tell my parents about the fact that I can't sleep and that I always feel really scared and nervous they simply tell me to ""close my eyes and fall asleep"" and to "" just calm down."" Amazing advice! I recently told them (it was so hard for me to do this) that I would like to see a psychiatrist because all of these things have been happening to me for years (and they are aware!) and my mother SCREAMED at me telling me that I was being ridiculous and that I just worried for no reason all the time (yes mother that's the problem) and that I just wanted an excuse to be lazy and for people to feel bad for me. She said it was an excuse for me to cover up my ""bad and irrational behaviour."" She said nobody can help me and that it's my own problem to deal with myself. She said ""everyone gets anxious you just don't know how to control and handle yourself and you think people will feel bad for you and help you because you're too lazy to fix yourself"" and that she isnt going to waste her money. then my parents finished it all off by telling me to apologize to them?",25Mar2017,4

6,"I'm 23 years old a high school/college dropout and unemployed all while suffering from unpaid student loans. I lost my previous job because of my depression and have been unable to find a job since last June, not only because of my lack of experience, but my town is suffering from a factory shut down that was housing most of the workers in my already small town. I can't drive due to social anxiety, and even if I could I don't have money for gas or a car. I've only had two jobs so far, one last year and one in 2013. The first one I lost because I intended to end my life and then ended up secluding myself when it didn't work. The second time I lost my job was because my S/O killed herself and in grief I tried to take my own life, ending myself in the hospital for an extended period.


I saw a therapist for about six months before finally dipping out. I dreaded having to go, and the medication I was on was just numbing me to the point I would sleep for 12+ hours a day and still being tired for the rest of the day. I was unable to function on a productive level.. or much of any sort of level at all. Then they wanted to bump up the dosage of the medication, and that's when I stopped going.


I don't really enjoy anything anymore and don't have the focus that I used to have. I play games to escape reality, but even the slightest disappointment in a game snaps me back to reality. If the disappointment is my fault, it just makes me feel even worse.


I pretty much live alone. I do live with my grandfather, but he only talks to me when he goes out. My grandfather is soon to lose his job due to the factory in town closing down, and we're already financially struggling.(Barely making enough money for food.) I don't really have any friends. That's not to say that I haven't tried making any, but my depression drove them off, or at least that's what I assume. My father left at birth and my mother is a drug addict who smoked all of her money away. I've been through stepdad after stepdad, a few who were abusive. My grandmother, who I felt was the only person who really cared about me, died in 2008.


Lately I've been unable to sleep. I don't feel like I'm living anymore. I lost a lot of weight last year (purposely) and was trying my best to be productive, but it seemed to amount to nothing in any sort of way. I haven't been able to speak to the few online friends I have lately, as much as I've tried. Some sort of anxiety trying to speak to even them lately, now. I think.. I'm pretty close to completely giving up, as much as I hate to say it. I'm not sure why I'm reaching out here, or if I'm even reaching out at all, but I don't really know where to go from here or really what to do.",25Mar2017,1

Ive lost enjoyment in things, so I don't do anything alone. it's scary to have to come back here every day because there is nothing for me to do. video games, reading, watching shows; all of it just gets interpreted through like this negative lens in my mind and triggers painful memories 

all I do is obsessively browse through Reddit reading comments on threads and listen to walkthroughs of old video games I used to enjoy as a kid. it's like it calms me down if that makes sense. it just makes no sense and I don't know how to get out of it",26Mar2017,1

12,"Hi, I have trouble with putting myself down and hating myself. Even if I am having an OK night, if I go out with my friends and see other girls out at the bar who are skinnier than I am and are just more attractive than I am, I automatically hate myself and can only think of how worthless and gross I am. I don't know how to not feel this way, I feel like no matter what I do, if I am ever faced with an image of another woman I just go into a negative thought spiral of how worthless I am.  If I tried to avoid anything that triggered these feelings I would have to live under a rock. I just don't know how to live a normal life without being confronted by these things that make me hate myself. ",26Mar2017,4
13,"I have psychosis and lately my thoughts are out of control, not really taking my meds, self harming everyday cause it kind of distracts my thoughts away from all the paranoia crap. I feel like taking my meds is pointless, any other ways to get better?",26Mar2017,2
14,"From a very very young age I was labeled by all of my teachers as the ""social butterfly""or they would say ""she is very bright but 'distracted' in class"". I excelled in my extra curricular activities but utterly sucked at every subject in school. My parents didn't know any better and could never understand why I couldn't concentrate. I had tutors and that never helped. I finished all through my masters with mediocre grades. To this day, I have never sought professional help. I honestly do not know where to start.   

&amp;nbsp; 

For as long as I can remember, I admire incredibly smart people and have always wished I could be just as smart (in my own way). I used to hang out with incredibly intelligent people for a few years before moving and always felt mesmerized whilst feeling no so smart at the same time. I wouldn't understand most of what was being discussed most of the time but I didn't care, I  would love listening hahahaha  

&amp;nbsp;

What brings me here? I was unemployed for a few years. This took an awful toll on my selfesteem, I was depressed as I felt useless and felt I was seriously getting ""stupid^ER"" by the day. 6 months ago, I was given an opportunity. I started in a low position, have slowly gained a bit of confidence but I know I can do more. I don't know how and with this I struggle. I cannot focus as much as I would like. Information that I learn in order to improve I feel it doesn't seem to stick to my brain. I make minor mistakes all because of attention to detail. I research and try to read information that is of my interest but cannot remember 1/4 of what I read.   I am in an environment where I have to teach myself about marketing and social media in a niche market because there isn't a marketing team. It is something I really really enjoy but boy do I struggle! 

&amp;nbsp;

I have been invited to a fantastic conference this week and I am thrilled but afraid to fail. I want to absorb as much as possible, key points to take in, but I know me and that is so not going to happen. This is not me putting myself down, this is me being honest about how my brain works. I cannot take notes as for 1, I am slow at that and 2 by the time I am done with the third word, I have forgotten the rest of the context lol. I can record certain things on my phone but it will really depend on where I am sitting and if my phone is able to capture the audio.

15,"I'm not sure if my wording is correct, but an acquaintance I know very minimally appears to be going through a break with reality.  He is 23 years old, and has started trying a few times recently to hitchhike to a distant city in order to establish himself as a ""public figure,"" has printed out business cards with mostly nonsense rhyming words, and is becoming focussed on finances and business plans for non-existent ventures.

16,"Hello all

I work as a ward manager in the UKs NHS and have been a qualified mental health nurse for nearly 10 years.

I've been watching US drama series for years and I've just started watching Iron Fist on netflix. There are scenes in the first few episodes where the main character is in a mental health hospital. To me, the scenes are highly disturbing and demonstrate an awful level of care towards people who need help. Are they at all accurate or are they the ""fiction"" that is warped from the truth?

They appear barbaric and show how we worked in the UK 40 years ago, but psychiatry has advanced a lot that I'd be surprised the US would be that far behind modern theory and best practice.

17,"My current psychological state is situational, however, I have had very bad anxiety and spurts of depression my entire life. 

Within the past month or so, I've had a string of events that have caused me to become so incredibly overwhelmed that I have trouble eating, sleeping, and performing any daily activities. Last night I tried going to bed at 9, but have yet to fall asleep because I was up all night crying and fighting off panic attacks, one which caused me to throw up. This has been happening off and on for the past couple weeks. 

I don't necessarily have a plan to kill myself, but I do not know how to take care of myself anymore. Sometimes I get urges to step in front of a train or traffic just because my body wants to feel something. If I went to a hospital for help, would they even take me in? I don't feel like I have any other options. ",26Mar2017,2
18,"Hi guys, I've never been to this subreddit but I really need some thoughts. I've been in a year long relationship with a girl who is diagnosed with borderline/bipolar. She's a student in her second year and she's really suffering right now. She's heavily medicated on high dose Sertraline as well as a lot of pain medication for back pain.

Recently she's been seriously ill. Drinking every day, barely eating, not speaking to anyone, sleeping all day, memory blackouts, self harming, full blown depressive state. I've seen her bad before and she's come out of it but I don't know what to do? I don't know how to help her because I've dealt with all my mental issues by going straight to the doctor and doing everything they recommended.

21,"I have been seeing a counselor for about 2 years now. I can't help but feel she's acted inappropriately, but I am uncertain because I have low confidence in my ability to make judgements. I also have never really had a counselor before so I lack knowledge on what is normal.

We spend a lot of time talking about random things that are unrelated to therapy. Much of the time it's about her and she self discloses a lot. She also has told me that she enjoys my company. She's offered to drive me home sometimes and explained how she would never do this for any other of her clients, however only in certain situations such as if I cant get home from somewhere but really want to go there. When i asked why, she said it was because i am ""stable"" and she has known me for a long time. She's also brought up how she knows me very well and whenever she sees things outside of her office she thinks to herself that I would like this or love that. She's also said before that I am attractive and asked me if I had a girlfriend. I replied no and she said: ""An attractive young man like you could get a girlfriend easily.""

Recently she's also asked me to watch two movies. The first being Her, which she told me ""isn't a film that you watch in public"" and the second being The Angry Birds movie, which she explained there is a therapist in it that reminded her of her. If you've watched either movies tell me why you think she would ask me to watch such films... I focused in on the therapist in the angry birds movie and noticed something, i want to see if other people noticed it too.

I can't help but feel things aren't quite right. I want to mention it, but I need advice. I am unsure of what is actually going on. It doesn't feel like therapy, but I am very reliant on her emotionally for support.

26,"I have always known that there is something wrong with me, but I didn't know what. After my last failed attempt at an intimate relationship, I have started reading about BPD (something that was fitting for my symptoms) and then NPD. I think I might suffer from the latter, as well as half of my family, and I am worried that I will end up all alone, in my high tower, having alienated everyone.

I am good looking (not the best, just good) and hypersexual, yet I mostly masturbate. I don't want a partner, unless I perceive him as really desired. In this case, one out of two things happen: either I earn his heart and trust and then alienate him out of fear that he will abandon me (thinking to myself ""Did I do that? Did I seriously do that? Why? Oh, at least it's my fault, so I can fix it next time... it's not that I am unwanted per se)""; or I win him, then I discover that he's not that great after all, and move on to the next victim without any real regard (""Suck it up, that's life"").

As I want to experience real love and intimacy with a partner I desire, I need help ASAP to change my shitty ways and stop manipulating and exploiting people.

My fears are comical: first of all, I fear that my ""partner"" might think about me in the same way that I think about him. Which is a totally disrespectful way, as an object (of desire), a mere function, an accessory...
1. He is MY partner, MY sweet-talking vibrator, MY walking erection (caused by ME, of course I can tolerate the though of his dick getting hard for another WOMAN... if he fucks goats, I'm OK with it), MY sweet smile (as long as it's ME making him smile) -
2. MY pet empath, MY mirror-mirror on the wall, I can shine my brilliance at him and watch him reflect it back on MYSELF with the vibrant power of thousand projectors. He HAS something I lack and desperately crave, he has empathy and can GIVE love, things I lack, but desperately need. Each and every time I think to myself that this time I will make right. But I always do wrong. The harder I try to avoid damage, the worse the damage is.
3. He's my personal audience, my faithful dog, dare he not be happy being faithful or being a dog, It makes me want to annihilate him. I am vindicative, but I don't take revenge, as I recognize that it won't help. But I have sworn revenge to many people, not only romantic partners, but anyone who disrespects me in any way.

I don't want to talk to people, I want to charm them and capture their minds and hearts. I pretend to listen and understand them, but only because I know that this captures minds and hearts.

I don't want to have sex with men, I want to demonstrate to them my passion and enthusiasm, my bedroom acrobatics, hook them and make them crave me, this is my fantasy. Actually, if I have to be fair, I am a pretty mediocre lover, unless I am enthusiastic about the partner (and myself, and how he looks on me). Then I become ... an enthusiastic partner, which is always good, but nothing very special.

After losing a romantic interest to my ego one more time I have decided that I can't afford this cycle to continue. Last time I tried to avoid manipulation and pretense, but things became horrible. I decided to ""show weakness"", but instead I raped emotionally the poor man and I feel awful. I vomited my insecurities and inferiority complexes all over him. 

Such horrible self-inflicted humiliation shattered my ego and I was a barely-functioning zombie for a while. I discovered a website, extensively dealing with NPD on the webs, and I think that it perfectly describes the way my brain works. The funny thing being, these things were always there, but I couldn't see them. My grandiose fantasies, my addictive behavior, total disregard for others, my addiction to flattery, including self-flattery (can't do anything about it - my own ego manipulates me into total submission).

My own version of empathy - I don't think about others, I will myself to think about others, then quickly start thinking about how I am thinking about others and how empathetic I am.


Even after discovering what is wrong, I just can't stop thinking about MYSELF and MY NARCISSISM. 


Professionaly, I am doing OK, I  love my job. It's the only thing capable of distracting me of thinking about MYSELF, MY PROBLEMS, MY BRILLIANT PERSONA, etc...


I can see how pathetic I am, or more likely, how just OK I am and how huge the gap between my self-image and real self is. It stings my ego, but that's OK.

The question is, can I learn how to love. Not just men, but my (imperfect) self, our (imperfect) world and to value this imperfect life. Or is this like diabetes, incurable?",26Mar2017,2
27,"I've been in psychotherapy for about 6 months. It's been helpful, but there have been a couple of therapies that I have been skeptical of. The first one is Internal Family Systems. When I'm having issues with rumination he'll say there are different parts of me and that I should have conversations with the different parts of me. So I'll have these conversations with myself as these ""different parts"" of me. The second is he's into Sufism. Sometimes he'll have me close my eyes and he'll say a prayer that's in Arabic (Were both white Americans). He's also an Enneagram enthusiast. 

I got the chance to ask another psychologist if that stuff was normal when I was getting an assessment done. He just responded saying that most psychotherapists take a eclectic approach and that those therapies, although strange, are probably harmless. ",26Mar2017,2

29,"Not sure if this is the right sub to ask for solutions but I am pretty desperate at this point. 

A little backstory: When I was 11 to 19, I was emotionally and physically abused by my stepdad (mom supported his abuse never stood up for me even blaming me for ""making him act that way""). At 19, I was kicked out and lived with someone else before something happened and I had to move back in with only my mom at 23. She and my stepdad had just began the divorce process (he walked out on her) so while she was going through (and still is) the divorce, she started behaving just like him, one minute being extremely verbally abusive, the next minute laughing and joking. 
I noticed I would calm down 100% (or so I thought) when she was happy and fine, always low-key worried about how long that'll last but then my stress would go through the roof when I noticed she was getting into one of her moods. 
So, a week ago, I completely cut her out of my life. Completely. Alright, that's enough backstory.

*So lately, I find that my mental abilities seem very much reduced. I'm not quick or sharp like I used to be, I stumble over my words a lot, switch up verb tenses incorrectly, I cannot remember song lyrics very well and I have developed extremely intense body tremors when I'm actively stressed about anything (it's like my adrenaline is on overdrive; my hands shake like a Chihuahua - my tongue even shakes).*
This has been building up for years but naively I thought that once the stressors (her and my stepdad) were out of my life, the symptoms would go away entirely, but now I realize that I've been so incredibly stressed out for such a long time that I am now functioning at what feels like 20% of what I used to be able to.

I'm angry and sad about all of this because it affects the way I interact with everyone - from friends to bosses - negatively and is hard for me to interact and function comfortably.

Anyway, is it possible for me to recover from this completely?  I do not want to take meds and I've been to therapists to no avail. 
I feel very lost at this point and maybe need to look at this in a different light. 
I'm not sure what I'm looking for really, I guess words of encouragement or whatever honestly. I just don't know what to do or where to start to retake control of my life and not feel like I'm at the mercy of my mental afflictions.

31,"I just needed to post this. I still think I'm depressed or in another rut. Probably in another rut. I just feel like it could grow into depression again. I realize lately after seeing my psych that I'm not honest with a lot of people. Not even with him. Because I feel being open is equal to being vulnerable. And in my past, being vulnerable and showing my true feelings never really worked. 

Like I'm some sort of psycho/sociopath or something. I just don't know who I am. When I've tried to step up and be that person who i feel is right, or the type of person that I feel can do things without question I always get back lash in social situations. Maybe I just lack empathy.

But that worries me, because whenever that happenes I would just retreat away into loneliness. And people tell me ""just be who you are"" but that doesn't work. I feel like that person would end up in jail, and scarier, I dont know that person. Doesn't everyone know themselves? So everyday I just try to be whoever and not really tell people the truth. But I'm 26. I can't keep doing this forever. I've only really started living life on my own 3 years ago.
