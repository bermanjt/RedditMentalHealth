1,"I struggle with depression. From time to time, I'll slip into a ""bad day"" and shut myself out from those close to me. My girlfriend asked me to describe one of my ""bad days"" to her so she could better understand what I deal with. This is what I came up with, I just wanted to share. Never stop fighting. 

""It's like you wake up and you already know you're in for it. You wake up earlier than normal but your minds been awake since you went to bed. You think forcing yourself back to sleep is what you need so you do that. Then you wake up 2 or 3 hours later than you normally would and you're mad at yourself for being a bum. 

You try and go about your routine. Morning coffee, brush your teeth, wash your face. Whatever you're into. You really appreciate your routine on bad days cause on those bad days, the depression does everything it can to fuck up those little moments you enjoy. Just putting the fucking cream in your coffee feels different on bad days. 

You want to eat. You want to shower. You want to run errands. You want to watch tv. You want to do what normal people do on any given day but for whatever reason your mind will not let you. The only thing your mind wants you to do is sit and think about every reason you're not enough for people, or every reason you have to hate yourself, or every time you've ever been hurt or hurt someone else. People remind you to eat and say you'll starve and you want to snap and say I fucking know that and wish I could think of basic human necessities rather than all of this shit in my head. 

You don't want to talk to anyone, but you don't want people to not talk to you. How fucked up is that? How selfish is it for you to be short and not have anything to say to people but still want them to talk to you? Then they get mad. They say you're being mean and short and not making time for them and as bad as you want to say no that's not what it is, you can't bring yourself to admit that your mind is so warped that you literally cannot be yourself. Or they get sad and tell you that they miss you and want to talk to the ""real"" you. Well believe fucking me, he's in there and he's trying his hardest to crawl back out and send the fucked up thoughts, anger and sadness back to whatever hell they came from. Then you get even more upset with yourself cuz you've made someone else sad or angry. 

And when you do that, you want to be able to make them feel better because that's the only thing you know how to do. You may not know how to make yourself feel better, but knowing you helped someone else is enough to make you feel worth something. But, and this theme seems to keep catching on, you can't. Your mind won't let you. The words that can help people are there but the depression won't let them reach your tongue or your fingers. 

It's torture. It's torture knowing the words are there. It's torture knowing you're in there and your mind won't let you out. You try and you try to snap out of it but for whatever reason, you can't. And you can deal with hating yourself for it, but you can barely handle knowing that it's affecting other people. 

When you finally do open up and talk to someone about what you're dealing with, they just tell you that you are loved and you're not worthless. And you know they're trying and they mean it, but it doesn't work. It doesn't work cuz you sit all day and try and tell the same things to yourself but your mind will not let you believe it. You sit and look at all the same photos you look at when you're sad to remind you of your friends and your family and your girlfriend. You listen to the music that remind you of times you were happy. You drive without a destination and sing at the top of your lungs just to know you're alive and not some comatose piece of shit who just lays in bed and feels sorry for himself. 

Deep down you know you're loved and you know you're important and you know you're worth something and it's just a bad day. You know all bad days pass. The sun will come up tomorrow, the air will feel more welcoming and the colors will get brighter. But the hardest part of every bad day is when you start remember all of that and you remember the good. It's the hardest because that's when the depression knows it's almost beat and it throws its worst at you. It's throws the flashbacks of walking into the hospital room and seeing your entire family stop what they're doing and stare at you while you see your mother dying, the flashbacks of you writing a suicide note and not knowing if anyone will take the time to read it, the flashbacks of laying on the ground while the woman you loved scratches, hits, and claws at you. Everything. It brings all of it back at the moment you think you're ok. 

But you fight. You fight through it and you accept all of it and you put your smile on and you accept that all of this is a part of you and you're going to be ok. And you never lose faith that these bad days will not turn into bad weeks, months or years. And you hope and pray that those close to you who have seen the worst of you, the worst of the bad days, are still there when you fight back and still love you.""",11Jul2017,2
2,"Is recovery possible? 
What did it look like or mean for you? 
If you feel comfortable talking about it, what were you recovering from? What are your diagnoses, how do you feel about them, and how do you see your own struggle?
What helped you along the way? 
How would you compare where you are now to where you were at your worst? 
How did you get from there to where you are now?
Did you think would be able to?
What motivated you?

Some info about my own life: my diagnoses are PTSD (probably more accurately cPTSD), depression and BPD (although I'm not sure that all adds up a useful way of describing my experiences, particularly the BPD - what I've read about it just doesn't seem to be a good match to my experiences). I feel fairly isolated socially. I haven't worked in a year and a half due to my declining mental health. Before that, my employment history was not so great due to ongoing mental health issues and crises.

(Please, no platitudes. I'm looking for straight-up, honest first-hand experiences.)

Thanks so much!",11Jul2017,1

4,"22 year old male from UK

not sure how to write this. not sure how to start.

i don't care who i am, i just care that i am happy.

i've had major depression this one time where i hated everyone and everything and lost interest in the world and just wanted to sleep and never wake up... lucky i pushed myself further and further everyday and escaped this depression (refused medication) and it went away after about 3 months of positive energy, good thoughts and going for walks.

then it came back in one quick swoop about a year later. it was a dip that lasted a week and it wasn't as serious, but very similar feelings. since then it has happened again and again and again.

sometimes it lasts a few hours and sometimes it can last 2 to 3 weeks. research tells me this is more than a mood swing and most likely bipolar disorder (yeah google, stay away from google if you want to keep your sanity).

i know for certain that i had ODD (oppositional defiant disorder) because i had a rough patch as a child where they diagnosed this but i am 22 now and i am not an angry or violent person... i care a lot about myself and other people but i do get pissed off pretty easily although it takes quite a lot for me to do anything about it.

i know 100% that i have OCD but i have not been diagnosed with it because i'm scared of the doctors and what they might say. but i am definitely curious about these things.

i had mild social anxiety which i forced myself out of (it lasted about 3 years), not sure how i did it but i believe in a healthy strong mind and that anything is possible!

then i get the intrusive thoughts which i have had for about 10 years now. sometimes they will spike and i will get a lot of them and suddenly they will disappear for a couple of weeks.

this brings me on to the big one. what do i do when the thoughts turn into conversations, and start becoming voices? i am stupid to have not noticed this sooner but now i can see the bigger picture. it makes more sense now and i have accepted what was at first, confusion, and now i feel relieved that there is some sort of explanation.

schizophrenia 
my dad had it. he killed himself in his early 20's due to mental health. my mum has a history of depression but has improved massively and is pretty much a different person, happier than ever, married and living the life she always wanted.

but the history is there and now i add the pieces together i feel like i've come to a conclusion...

there is only one way to find out, and that's to speak to someone about it.

i've missed out a lot of information to keep this as short and simple as possible but feel free to ask for more info.

this is a throwaway account that i will come back to check, i am terrified to post this. i've never spoken to anyone about anything except the major depression and ODD which my mum helped me with and went to the doctor with me but everything else i have kept hidden but i feel much better just writing this and posting it anyway... not even sure if i'm looking for help or acknowledgement... we'll see where this goes.",11Jul2017,1

7,"i just got out of the hospital today after a week long stay in the behavioral/mental health unit. that was my second time being hospitalized for the same thing in the last month. the doctors and psychiatrists there prescribed me a few new medications and i was just wondering if anyone had any experience with any of them. i am on 50 mg of Pristiq and 2.5mg of Abilify (antidepressants) in the morning, 50mg of Vistaril (up 3 times a day if needed) for occasional anxiety, and lastly 5mg of Ambien and 10mg of Melatontin (over the counter) at night to fall asleep. i feel like this is a whole cocktail of mixed medications, but i will do literally anything to just feel better or even anything at all at this point.",11Jul2017,1
8,"ive had 7 sessions so far with my first therapist (ever).

when i started i was having one or two serious panic attacks a day. after two sessions i was able to curb the attacks and i rarely have the attacks anymore, but i still suffer from a number of psychosomatic ailments caused by anxiety that haven't really changed much since i've been seeing the therapist.

my main problem is resistance. i have trust/vulnerability issues and a deep skepticism of therapy/therapists in general. e.g. the whole thing seems phony to me, i dont like the fact that i have to pay somebody to help me, or be concerned about my issues. ive had anxiety/paranoia for several years and only made the decision to come to therapy because the panic attacks and physical pains became unbearable. every time i leave the office i'm upset with myself for not being more forthcoming, but im not sure if i'll ever have the courage to be vulnerable enough in front of another person for any real healing to take place.

i'm not sure if its because of the therapist (who seems very experienced but maybe just isnt a match for me) or jsut because i'm too resistant to make any progress. 

should i jump ship and try to find another therapist, or stick it out for another while with this one?",11Jul2017,1

11,"Hello.

I’m a 24 year old female in the United States.

I have typed and retyped this about a dozen times, and am not even sure if this is the correct place to post this. I sifted through a bunch of subreddits, and this seems to be the only one that allows ""asking for (psychological/therapy) advice"" rather than more academia/practice-related ones that are devoted to sharing therapeutic methods, research, ideas, career path advice, etc.

**Main Question:** 

I do not know what type of therapy to look for given my background and symptoms. I don't know how to choose a therapist or determine what style would best suit my needs (I have insurance). This is causing me to delay receiving treatment, and my mental and physical health are becoming very poor because of it. 

I am seeking treatment because: (1) my mental/emotional/physical health is at its worst (fearing falling asleep due to increasing nocturnal panic attacks/paralysis, cannot perform normal tasks, extreme isolation, anxiety, loss of identity, and fast weight gain into obesity) (2) I want to learn ways to become healthy again, preferably without pharmaceuticals.

**Then:**

My parents often suggested to see a therapist when I was around 16-18, as I've always been extremely shy/introverted despite having close friends as both a child and teenager with a good, stable family life. I had some self-esteem/communication issues paired with a very cynical attitude at worst. Nothing debilitating, and nothing I felt ever needed professional attention. To me, it was just fleeting emotions that I'd learn to sort out on my own as I grew into my adult self.

Around age 20, I was mildly depressed by my own standards as I had gone off to college in a new city, had a death in the family, was having trouble making friends, never had a romantic life (I was asked out some in high school, the feeling just wasn’t mutual), was changing majors and didn't know what to do with my life, led to me failing some classes and going on academic probation - that type of thing. I also had a very bad habit of mindlessly picking my the area around my nails on my fingers until they would bleed or were torn up, sometimes infected. I have done this all of my life, but the frequency and extent became worse in college. Once I had to excuse myself from class to go to the bathroom to stop the bleeding and cover it up. This is not self-harm, but a mostly mindless activity. In the times that I was aware I was doing it, I rarely felt pain and it was so habitual it wasn’t abnormal to me.Because of this, I decided to find a psychologist for the first time. 

I visited this psychologist a handful of times. She was late our first meeting by 40 minutes (from lunch, not other clients), mainly suggested I try natural supplements to boost my energy, and came to the conclusion that I was ""just too serious."" In the third session, she told me to sit in a chair, close my eyes, and envision myself in a place I felt most relaxed and hooked me up to something that monitored my vitals. After a minute, she asked me what I was picturing: I said I was floating in space - just black and surrounded by stars and white noise. She said, ""that's strange, no one's ever said that before. Most people choose a beach or something."" She also asked 4-5 times if I meditated because she said only seconds after I closed my eyes, my heart rate was very low and ""controlled"". I said no each time; I didn't feel believed or listened to on top of my gut feeling that she was not helping me in any regard. So I never returned.

I left still wanting to find help, but I just didn't know where to look or how to avoid therapists like her. To be clear, I know my experience with her does not represent what all experiences in therapy can be and I don’t see therapy in and of itself in a negative light because of her. I just stopped looking because feelings my younger self went through resurfaced, (e.g. “well, maybe I should just sort it out on my own.”) Although, admittedly, I did have some very temporary negative thoughts, too (e.g. “she’s only paid to hear me, it’s not like she really cared anyway.”)

Not long after, I remedied my depression by lots of exercise (lifting weights/running 6x/week), strict healthy eating, and pushing myself. I had never felt better. Shortly thereafter, I got into my first relationship (that I am still in).

**Now:**

The reasons I went to a therapist then have almost zero connection to the reasons that I am seeking a therapist now. Then, I just needed guidance, wanted to build confidence, coping skills, etc. Now, I believe it's a matter of my physical health, life-span, and livelihood.

There is a lot of relevant background information that has led up to the development of new or the exacerbation of existing issues, but for the sake of brevity and anonymity I won’t go into detail about those as I’m mostly looking for direction on how to find appropriate treatment given my symptoms that are a result of many extremely stressful factors (e.g. health, financial, romantic, social, etc.) in my life.

I have gained over 100 pounds over the last 4 years. (145 then, now almost 260), and 30 in the last 6 months. At first, it began eating out a lot with my new boyfriend (first/only sexual partner), then drinking alcohol together for fun (lots of shots), overeating at home, drinking lots of sodas, exercising less and less over time until not at all, etc. Bad choice after bad choice for instant gratification. I’m embarrassed of my body. I do not blame ‘society’ or feel threatened by healthy/thin people, I am simply embarrassed of my choices. It’s only so long before bad choices begin to reveal themselves on the outside for all to see. This thought alone makes me feel quite low; it seems to suggest I only ‘care’ about the consequences of bad choices if others can see them.

Because of the weight gain I feel personally responsible for creating a dead bedroom. I can’t remember the last time we had sex (maybe January) and it was becoming noticeably sparse well before that. We had conversations as I noticed it, and he would ultimately deny the problem (stress, tired, not in the mood) or outright deny that I am overweight “to him” and ""am still beautiful."" The extent of intimacy from him now is a short kiss or grabbing my butt for a few seconds in bed before we go to sleep. The last three times I tried to give him oral, he couldn’t seem to finish. The third time, it just hit me hard and I left the room and cried in the bathroom. I knew why, and I wasn’t upset with him - only myself. He said it was just “bad timing.” Sometimes he has resorted to saying he thinks his sex drive might be low. But anytime I go out of town he masturbates, so I’m not very confident that’s true.

I do not have a job, I don’t have a single hobby anymore, a single friend anymore, I don’t exercise anymore, I eat horribly most of the time, I have cut out my childhood best friends and even missed one of their weddings out of shame for what I look like and who I have become. Anytime they come to visit I make excuses even though I am desperate to have a friend here to just hang out with or work towards common goals.

Sadly, the seclusion doesn’t end there. The only place I’ve gone into alone in the last year is a grocery store, doctor’s office, or car service shop. I haven’t gone into any public place unless it’s absolutely necessary, and even then I am flustered and extremely anxious. I park my car deliberately so the least amount of people see me. In front of my own house, so no one sees me at all. I get calls to make a dentist appointment, and can’t get myself to do it. Need to renew vehicle inspection, put off until very last minute. I wore the same outfit every day, until my mom dragged me to a mall to pick out new shirts. When at home, sometimes 6 days will pass since I’ve showered. Dishes, laundry, messes pile up, and I feel guilt that I’m just a disgusting, lazy, unfeminine, failure of a partner. I say unfeminine not because I feel pressured to fit a 'traditional role', but because I've always put forth effort in taking care of myself, being kind, polite, respectful, nurturing, and generally submissive (basically to have a calming presence).

Finally, what concerns me most is I am starting to fear sleep. I am at the point that I am afraid to fall asleep at night. This began after an episode almost a year ago where I woke with a pounding, racing pulse with panic. Nothing I did could lower my pulse, I was flushed, had extreme chills, and thought I was going to go unconscious any moment. I was taken to the ER and it led to a frenzy of non-conclusive appointments and tests for months afterwards. I was prescribed a calcium channel blocker in case of emergencies, but I’ve not had anything as severe as the night I went to the ER so I have not used it. But I've had moderate episodes dozens of times, giving me more anxiety as to whether or not I should take one. From my own research, I believe it was a nocturnal panic attack despite never having had one during the day. This oftentimes leads me to reading on my phone until I cannot keep my eyes open any longer, going into 5, 6, sometimes 8 AM. This leaves me exhausted in the day, and if I end up trying to nap out of sleep deprivation, it’s almost guaranteed I’ll have a nightmare combined paralysis both in my actual dream and as I wake up. I refuse to nap unless I absolutely cannot fight it for this reason.

Rationally, I know I can change my behaviors, help my anxiety, overcome fears, and become healthy again. But in my head, I feel so far gone off the deep end I don’t know where to begin or how to start.

I am consumed by fear, but I do not want to die because I am too afraid to save myself.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you for anyone who spent time reading this, and to any who respond.

13,"two things in particular are bugging me a lot more lately, anger and anxiety. 

ive been getting random outbursts of anger lately, which is odd because i havent had issues with controlling my anger in a long while, but it isnt really the same kind of anger as before either, it feels different, it's a lot more reckless anger, and it's usually alongside this feeling of just pure dread, almost like im in shock.

also, i used to have this thing where i'd bet on things with myself, like, ""if you dont click off the page before it loads, then you'll fail that test"", stuff like that, it started in childhood and just continued from there. i know it sounds irrational, but i just kind of did it on impulse. i eventually got myself to stop because i realized how irrational it is, but lately it's come back, but instead of being based around smaller less harmful things like passing a test, it's become a lot more serious, for instance, me and my family were driving on a long bridge and the whole time i was worried we'd crash and fall into the water and drown, and i would start thinking things like ""if the next song that plays is this, then we'll fall into the water"" or ""if the speed limit is 55, we wont fall into the water."" im not doing it as much as i used to, but whenever i start getting somewhat stressed or worried i start thinking thoughts like that. 

i honestly dont know what to make of it, and i have no idea why all the sudden these problems are arising again. 

does anyone have any idea on what could possibly be causing this?
i see a therapist already, and im considering talking to her about it, i'd just like to get some sort of opinion. ",11Jul2017,1

15,"Hello. I'm a 24 years old woman who has been suffering from endometriosis for over 2 years now. Endometriosis is a condition in which the tissue that normally grows inside the uterus grows outside it, and it is terribly painful (at least in my case). Mine is located in the rectal/vaginal area (as it can literally grow anywhere) and ever since I started developing symptoms, I've been struggling with excruciating pains beyond anything you can imagine. It is something I would NEVER desire not to my worst enemy. The constant feeling that my insides are gonna come out when I go to the bathroom and during my periods, cramps and intense pain that can make me pass out, the constant ingestion of pills/painkillers to ease the pain... you don't know what it does to your mind. You can't imagine what it's like to live in constant agonizing pain. It simply fucks you up. 

I've been under treatment that has helped me easing the pains and having longer moments of peace and relative ""life quality"", and I'm finally getting surgery next week but I believe I might need some therapy afterwards, because my mind is just fucked up. I barely recognize myself nowadays. I can't sleep properly at night, I get these chest pains that I believe are due to stress and I get constant, depressing thoughts at all times. I just can't be happy anymore and I don't see myself being happy after the surgery. I think this disease changed me completely, I'm not who I was 2 years ago and I'm sad to say I don't like who I am now. I feel lost and torn even when the surgery is just a week from now. It's like I've given up and can't see how could I rebuild my life and who I was even after being cured by my surgery, which makes no sense. 

Where should I start seeking for help? Do I need a psychiatrist? A psychologist? I don't even know. I live in Caracas, Venezuela. There's plenty of options and resources but I'm lost and don't know where should I begin.

18,"I just want a place to put this down in writing. 

In my senior year of high school, I went in to my pediatrician for my last checkup. When I got my results, he showed me a chart of my BMI and such and informed me that I was literally on the threshold of being underweight - any lower and I would be underweight. This didn't surprise me, as I've always had a fast metabolism and didn't really eat all that much. In my youth, my parents had always ribbed me about being skinny and would often jokingly suggest that I gain weight. A little later that summer, I went swimming with some of my friends and one of them casually remarked that ""I was as skinny as a supermodel"". We all know the old adage: ""The easiest way to insult a man and his masculinity is to call him a female"", and while I'm sure this comment wasn't an intentional attempt to insult my masculinity, it certainly had that effect. In addition, the girl that I liked at the time also told me that it would be better if I wasn't so skinny. These events struck a chord with me, and I started to research ways to gain weight. I began trying to eat more and exercise, but unsurprisingly failed to gain any weight.

At this point, I went to college and fell into depression for a number of reasons, one of them being a growing concern with my slim and ""feminine"" frame and the perceived lack of respect that I was receiving due to my corresponding lack of weight. In addition, I was growing extremely frustrated with not being able to gain weight at all despite deliberate efforts on my part, and I decided that I just needed to prove to myself that I could gain weight - any type at all, not just muscle. I'd like to outline some of the strategies that I adopted during this time in my attempts to gain weight:

 - I switched from 2% milk to whole milk because it had more fat.

 - I researched nutrition facts at restaurants in order to deliberately order whatever had the most fat.

 - I stopped doing any type of cardio in order to preserve calories.

 - I purposely ate large meals late at night before bed because I believed it would be turned more efficiently to fat that way.

 - In order to preserve my stomach capacity for food, I cut down on the amount of water I drank.

 - Also in order to preserve stomach capacity, I actively avoided eating vegetables.

 - For every meal, I ate until I felt that I was about to throw up or cry.

After adopting these strategies, I weighed myself at the end of the school year and found that I had gained only two pounds. Needless to say, this did not help my depression and only deepened my worry about my weight. Thankfully, after a little while I was able to escape my depression and gain weight in a healthier manner. 

Obviously, I'm not promoting any of the things I did. I have no real reason for writing this; other than the fact that I feel the need to get it off my chest. However, if there is a takeaway, I suppose it would be that in a society (American, can't speak for others) where everyone seems to be concerned with fat-shaming and losing weight, skinny-shaming also exists, and for males, it is fueled by unhealthy body image standards that don't receive as much attention as their counterparts for women (not that those are any better). Hopefully none of you can relate to this, sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit, and thanks for reading.

19,"This would range from OCD, Biopolar, Schizophrenia, Paranoia, Disillusion, Depression, fear of failure, and possibly more depending on how things go.

I'm not familiar with drug abuse, which I know is a common struggle, but I did get drunk (like way drunk) to try to get rid of the voices in my head and found it didn't work, so I have experience with that. I'm also asexual and autistic so I'm sure that will come up at some point!

20,"Before I go on, first I'd like to say I hope this is the right subreddit to post this on. Second, I'm not on here in the hopes of some official diagnosis. Just trying to get some advice. 

My entire life, school has been very tough for me. Not because I couldn't grasp concepts, but because I've had a tough time focusing or concentrating on anything I don't find to be particularly interesting. I know, common problem. 

The problem is now I'm 23, and the fall semester is coming up. I want to do better. I know I can, it's just a matter of pulling this strange intense concentration I have into my daily life. 

I can go an entire day without eating or using the bathroom if I'm ""stimulated"" enough. I've done it many times, and hearing me say ""Shit, I forgot to eat today"" isn't uncommon for my friends and family. By stimulated I mean mentally, not physically. Whether it be editing a video, to reading a book, to playing video games (this is a huge time-waster for me), I can do it endlessly. Obviously, feeling hunger or the need to pee does arise, but it's usually just pushed down with a ""right after this"" attitude. 

It's usually not in a constructive manner. Editing a video until 5am without realizing it isn't how I want to channel that focus. I want to be able to point that at my school work and at real constructive activities. I understand that there's always got to be a balance of work and fun, but there's too much fun and not enough work. 

When I'm not in that focused state, I'm all over the place. I'm bouncing from one idea or thought to another. Constantly day dreaming, usually because I think what's going on in my head is more interesting than what's going on outside of it. Again, obviously not the healthiest mindset to have in my day to day life. 

I just really want to be able to enter that almost trance-like mode more often, and when it's necessary. It's like the only thing that exists is whatever I'm focused on, everything else is just noise.

I've recently taken up meditating after hearing about what it can do for your mental control, and I can never tell if it's worked or not. Usually I just feel tired. 

So basically, I'm just looking for some advice. Should I consider getting examined for something like ADD or ADHD? Is this just how normal people operate and I'm just not aware of it? Also, anyone else who has this constant aloufness feeling, I'd appreciate your thoughts or experiences.

26,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 29 year old male, and I'm a complete train wreck (most of the time).

I've been contemplating writing this post for almost a year, but just now getting around to it, because that's how chaotic my mind seems to be. Go to the Dr to figure it out? Easier said than done. I've been to the Dr twice in the past 8 years, only to get prescribed Vyvanse last year, which I stopped taking because the Dr wanted me to get a physical, and I ended up spacing it and doing other things.

I have a habit of drinking, nothing crazy, but definitely consistent. I smoke cigarettes, and I make really good money. However, I'm TERRIBLE at managing it. For me, money works like this: I get paid, I go spend it. I'm incredibly good at what I do, but I'm horrible to work with, because the only consistency in my life is my own inconsistency. I really have no idea how to even explain it. It's like, in my head, I know EXACTLY what I should be doing, it's just that I rarely do those things, and my life stays in a constant state of chaos.

I don't even drive because my mind is so all over the place that I think I'd crash. I have horrible anxiety, which causes me to do things that cause more anxiety. I'm terrible at even remembering to shower sometimes, or mustering the mental strength to do basic life tasks.

I'm also compulsive. Sometimes not being honest feels as normal as anything. It's horribly frightening.

I even feel like it's difficult to focus enough to read sometimes, often glancing over things, but it never really ""sinking in"". I'm at a point in my life where it's all mounting up, and approaching 30, it's becoming too much to carry. It needs to be fixed, somehow.

I met my INCREDIBLE girlfriend last year, and she's been the greatest thing to ever happen to me. I want so badly to be the best version of me so I can give her everything she deserves, but I feel so completely lost. I don't use any drugs. I'm consistently awake until 3-5AM every night because my mind wanders and racing nonstop.

Just recently, I've began flirting with the idea that I may be autistic, although I really have no idea, because i don't go to the Dr. I know that if I could get past this weird block in my mind, everything would become clear and I'd be living the life I want.

I could go on, and on, and on, and on, but my question is: Does anyone else here deal with anything similar, have advice, etc?

Thanks so much!

29,"Hello.
I am happy to share what i have learned in the area of mental health. When we begin our day it is important to set up a positive intention in mind as soon as possible. To begin the positive momentum sooner then later. Even if you feel depressed it is ok because help is on your way.

What i did today is start to ride my home bike to see how far i can go. Until now i have done 56 km and i plan to do beyond 200. 

For those interested in positive and practical suggestions on how to change your momentum, i am here to offer my input.  ",12Jul2017,2
30,"Preface: My parents are going through finalizing their divorce after being separated for a year. They had been married for 30 years before they split. My brother and I are both adults, but it still sucks to go through. Here's to hoping this will finally get through to my dad. Names and locations changed for privacy. The text my mom sent said something like ""I was at the dentist today, have to get a root canal on Thursday.""

Dad,

This email is for me. I know you love me more than anything, so please, read this with an open mind for me. Please do not read this until you’re in a good place to do so. I’ve got a lot to say and I want to make sure you’re in a place where you can handle it all before you read it. 

What happened yesterday was chaotic. Your responses were unfiltered and unwarranted. The way I read mom’s message was she was letting us know about her health. You might think she had some ulterior motive, but reading her message at face value without looking for a deeper meaning, it was a harmless message. 

Even if she did have an ulterior motive, you had no reason to respond the way you did. If you thought she was trying to put (my brother) and me in the middle of you two, why would you play into it? At what point when you were sending your messages did you think “This is an appropriate response?” 

I’m scared for you dad. I love you so much, and I’m truly scared for you. Your ability to take a step back and look at things rationally has dissolved, and you lack self control when your emotions get triggered, which is happening more and more frequently. Those messages came an hour before I had to go teach today, putting me in a serious amount of emotional distress. I actually blocked your number for a couple hours so my phone wouldn’t be going off in my lesson, because I use the metronome on my phone to teach and I didn’t want your messages to keep popping up on the screen. I also just couldn’t handle reading your messages anymore. 

How many kids do you think have to block their parent’s number because they’re worried about them sending a wall of angry texts while they’re at work? 

There’s another thing I want to talk to you about. I have a mental illness. I don’t know what it is exactly, but dad, I am mentally ill. I can recognize it, fortunately, but I know I have something that I need to get help for. I have already contacted a foundation for union musicians here that help with that, I should hear back later today or tomorrow. 

The day I sat in with that brass band a few days after you left, after I played with them I had a horrible anxiety attack. It felt like my chest was shutting down, my vision went black, and I couldn’t breathe. It took about an hour to get a normal breathing pattern back, and another 5 or 6 hours to feel normal. On top of that, I have anxiety on a regular basis over nothing, have been experiencing depression, and have even been having suicidal thoughts that come out of nowhere with no stimulus. 

I will never act on those thoughts. I know they shouldn’t be there though, and it’s one of many reasons I’m seeking help. On top of all that, I have anger issues that get triggered by the dumbest shit. It gets to points where (my girlfriend) is scared to be around me, and I don’t blame her. What sucks even more is that after I come down from those states, I think “wow, I acted just like dad.” 

I inherited this from you. Whether or not you want to face it, you also have a mental illness and you passed it onto me. Normal people don’t act like us. If you truly as much as you say you do love me, then dad, please seek help. A counselor would be a great place to start before jumping to a psychologist or psychiatrist. But the sooner a mental health professional can diagnose you, I can get help for it, too. I may not have exactly what you have, but knowing what you have will help immensely with the professionals here helping me get to the right path.

I don’t want to be this way. I don’t want you to be this way. The way you spend your free time isn’t healthy. When you were with us helping us move, you spent all of your free time drinking beer and smoking. When we were looking for hotels in (the city I just moved to) you requested one with a pool, so I booked and paid for the La Quinta. You didn’t use the pool once. Instead you hung out in your room or outside your room drinking and smoking. That’s literally all you did. 

After we moved into our apartment, when (my girlfriend) and I were gone for 5 hours or so while I was taking her to teach, you sat on our balcony drinking beer and smoking the entire time while looking at your phone. I was so mad when I came back to see that you hadn’t done anything but that, but now, it just makes me sad. You could’ve gone out and seen something new, you could’ve gone out and done anything. But instead you sat in one place and drank and smoked. 

That isn’t normal. Healthy people don’t do that. Today after I told you to stop drinking so much you said you hadn’t been drinking, but then in the next breath said you had earned yourself a beer. That proves my point exactly. Beer has become a staple in your life, and that’s not okay. It’s making you worse, and I can understand why people don’t want to be around you. 

To be honest, I was relieved to take you to the airport your last day here. I was so tired of being around you because I had no idea how you were going to act on any given day. Your mood and behavior is completely unpredictable and you fly off the handle at the most random things without being able to stop and think “is this an appropriate way to react?”

I hate that I see this side of you in myself. It’s not fair to me. It’s not fair that I inherited all of this from you. You’ve had the opportunity to get help for so long, but you’ve been so stubborn that there was nothing wrong with you that you didn’t think far enough ahead to think about whether or not it could’ve gotten into your sons. It’s in me, and I hate it. You’ve been selfish in not seeking help. 

Dad, I need you to get help. I need it for myself. I want you to get help for your own well being, but more importantly, I want you to get help so I can figure out what’s wrong with me. I don’t feel good and I don’t want to keep feeling this way. 

On another note, I think I found a full time playing gig down here. Through some networking I got the contact of some party/cover bands, and wouldn’t you know it, one of them needs a full time trumpet player because their guy just moved. I’m meeting the leader tomorrow at a bar where another musician I’m meeting (the first call lead trumpet player in (this area))) is playing. I talked to the bandleader tonight, and he said just from talking to me, my resume, and who recommended me, he doesn’t need to hear me play for the gig. He didn’t go into specifics, but he said this is enough work and pay to be a full time job. Hopefully I’ll get more details tomorrow.

Despite all the horrible ways I’m feeling, I’m still getting out and pushing this shit as far down as I can for now. I can’t keep it up, though. Doing this causes it to come back in episodes that are unhealthy and scary to deal with. I feel fine now, but I know from the way I’ve felt before wasn’t just a temporary feeling. It’s not so much of a comes and goes as much of a comes and gets suppressed. 

I love you dad, and I would never cut you off. I don’t want to cut you off. I need you in my life. Please reflect on this for a while before giving me a response.

32,"***Lately I've grown a strong distaste to the idea of being ""nice"".*** I really do think the words ""nice"" and ""friendly"" are entirely different things. All my life I've lived in vain being ""nice"" in hopes nice things would happen to me. I suppose I was ""nice"" out of selfishness then, but notably also fear. I was ""nice"" also so **bad things** wouldn't happen to me. And so I've lived my 22 years mostly being the **terrified ""nice"" guy** who inevitably gets used by other people at best.

I'm surrounded by arguably loser friends at times, but at other times I look at them as well taught in parts of human nature I still feel foreign to. For one, I've got a friend who's recently decided to take on living in another city on his own to learn acting - this city being Los Angeles of all things, us normally living in a quiet and safe little city. This friend is someone I've known since elementary school. Oddly enough most of the people I hang with are from those years, whether as classmates or neighbors. It took me a long time to consider the thought that maybe we all aren't so different and maybe we're all together for some unconscious reason, we all tick the same way? I used to think about cutting ties with them all and starting fresh with no-one, and I still don't know to this day if that'd have been for the better or not. I used to have the impression everyone, including them, must resent me in some way - so I didn't want anything to do with them. That feeling silently subsided, while I'm not sure if I'd say it was left unattended to or not. I did wonder if the isolation would just sink me deeper though ... but one thing that led me on that trail of thought was several occasions my parents put thoughts in my head that they didn't respect me as a friend, while not exactly saying it out-right.

I can't help but see my father as a dutiful man that has no faith, **no trust**. As he is my father *(even while typing this now)* I feel like a **petulant child who doesn't understand his own ignorance**, but I honestly have no idea anymore - so I continue. So, my family is middle-class and life isn't so bad. We have more than most of the people I know and I have just about everything I'd want - but it took a while til I realized that was in the material. When I look at my other friend's families, instead of a third TV I see a few guests inside spending time with their families. At my house, guests hang out maybe a dozen times a year. We're all ""happy"" people, but I can't help but see our lives as secluded and lonely the more I think about it. My dad has only really one friend he talks with occasionally, most of his free time spent maintaining the house and watching TV. He's a dutiful man no doubt, and a smart man at that, but isn't something off? My mom has no friends besides one neighbor who comes once in a blue moon for a bit, maybe they go out shopping. She has plenty of family members out-of-state, but rarely to they call. She's an artist, a good one, but as I am one myself I've come to realize the mindset that likely accompanies.

... but I talk on and on while I should note at a glance my parents are happy, smart, and dutiful - really all the best qualities you'd think. Even I don't know if they aren't, but I guess my point is I don't know if they're even good role-models for me to follow. I'd have no idea how to confront this thought-process with them, so I guess it'll be another thing I leave unattended. But I have come to feel recently that instead of that I might just leave the house, while I wouldn't say move out. I'm a poor cashier who has a decent savings of $5000, but who lives in California. I have been going to school and haven't finished. With those details it's obvious that moving out is a premature, childish, selfish, stupid, self-destructive thing to do. Why would I want to move out from parents that have given me everything? From parents that try to give me advice, who lecture me almost monthly, and who say they love me? But these are also the parents I walk past and look at, for them to sometimes almost shutter or stutter in speech, or to make awkward brief comments. These parents say they love me, but **they feel so distant**. I look at them, and they might turn their head away without a smile.

**I don't understand people.** I'm anxious and I don't even know if I'm depressed. The fact I even considered moving out recently is an empowering idea for me. Earlier, my alternative felt to be suicide, but I live such a **euphorically safe lifestyle** I knew I'd never be able to do it at home with my parents. I can just sit in my room all day if I want to and immerse myself online typing up threads.

I feel I wrote this in the style of a build-up, but this is nothing more than a **confused and frustrated ramble**. **I'm a 22-year-old kid who feels paranoid, yet either can't admit it or feels it's an excuse.** My parents feel I'm a selfish spoiled child who doesn't understand respecting others, while I feel I'm a person who respects everyone yet wouldn't miss a chance to bolt in the other direction.

If there's anything I feel I know best from all this, it's that ""nice"" doesn't mean ""friendly"". **For now on, I won't be the ""nice"" guy.**

*P.S. Lately my go-to song is ""Radiohead - Palo Alto"". I feel it carries these ideas in some form. The album, OK Computer, as a whole does. ""Man of War"" and ""Paranoid Android"" notably. Also, here's an obscure quote I feel is relevant: https://youtu.be/FIgP6Yz5a7w?t=304 (til 5:20)*",12Jul2017,1
33,"Hey all! Wondering if anyone has any advice re: antidepressants for me. I go up and down with my mood, I've had depression for a good few years now and I often find that when I'm ready to ask for antidepressants from the doctor, when I'm so low that counselling/CBT isn't helping me, I make an appointment and by the time it rolls around I don't feel as low! And so on and so forth. Very much a vicious circle.
Finally last week I made an appointment and stuck to it, went and got prescribed Sertraline. I took it for the first time on the Friday and throughout the day spoke to several friends &amp; acquaintances who have been on sertraline, and they just totally put me off it. Most said it wasn't worth it for them, and the thing that put them off it was a numbing/emotionless effect (as well as nasty side effects). That's the exact thing I'm trying to get away from! I'm not so much trying to numb extreme sadness, but trying to get away from a numbness I've been experiencing recently, very existential depressing thoughts and heavy dissociation/depersonalisation. So it seemed that sertraline wouldn't be the antidepressant for me...
so I only took one 50mg pill the one morning and then abandoned it. Not sure what to do now. I'm going to make another appt and ask for a different antidepressant, anyone have any recommendations for something that might work for my symptoms?

Sorry about the big ramble, probably wasn't necessary at all. Just needed to get this off my chest as I've never taken antidepressants before and it's all very new and scary to me. Part of me feels like a fake who just needs counselling, and part of me doesn't want to rely on meds, but hey ho.
Thanks in advance! (I'm from the UK btw.)

TLDR: Not sure if sertraline is the right antidepressant to treat my symptoms (dissociation/depersonalisation, existential dread, kinda numb). Bit scared of taking meds and need reassurance, don't know what to ask for from doctor.",12Jul2017,1

I'm a 24 year old female student and I have a major problem. 
I suffer from a whole lot of unreasonable fears. Like waking up in the middle of the night, thinking I might have cancer and not being able to get over that completely unreasonable thought.
I get those thoughts randomly all the time and they really bother me, because usually I'm a very calm, reasonable person who analyses things very rational. But those thoughts just hit me out of nowhere. 
I know that they are not healthy and I talked about them to a therapist. Her advice was 'Well then if you know that they are unreasonable stop thinking about it.' That was it. Like, how am I supposed to stop something if I don't even know how or why it starts?

35,"Hi Reddit,

I just wrote you a little book. I'm bad at being brief. I'd really really appreciate it if you read it and responded. Thank you so much.

I'm 16 years old (17 in a few months). And ever since December of 2016, my sleep schedule has been fucked. It's not that I can't sleep, it's just that I keep myself up late into the night with my iPad and my iPhone, with social media, YouTube, Netflix and reddit and whatnot. I heard it's recommended that teens get 9 hours of sleep every night.. I am far from that. I usually end up falling asleep at midnight, sometimes even one or two in the morning, and then getting up bright and early for school at 6:30. 

I haven't felt well rested in a year. I am constantly tired. I've known this whole time that I've been ""sleep deprived"" but at this point it's at its worst, and I am truly feeling the effects right now. My arms and legs are always sore and weak. And the past few weeks my eyes have been feeling strained, and I've been having a nearly 24/7 headache. My brain doesn't seem to function properly: everything stresses me out, I tend to see everything as a chore. It's so hard for me to focus and retain knowledge, as proved in the last few months of school and now in summer school. And don't even get me started on social interaction. I've never been a social butterfly, but now talking with others has become so goddamn challenging. It's become harder for my brain to interpret what other people mean and feel, and it used to be much easier for me. 

I am scared that I have already ruined myself to the point of no return. I'm seeing my psychiatrist this Friday to get a professional outlook on the situation, but from what I've gathered from multiple sources online, the effects of chronic sleep deprivation are long term, and there's not a lot of recovering that can be done. 

I used to think I was smart, yknow? Not quite academically, but intellectually. And now I feel as if I'm throwing it all away. 
What can I do? I really don't like living like this. It doesn't even feel like I'm alive most of the time. I don't want to be brain dead. I feel like I'm ruining my life. The past few days of having these realizations have given me great feelings of guilt and devastation. Is there any coming back from this?",12Jul2017,16

47,"Things are coming to an end with my current boyfriend of almost 5 years. Over the past two-three years, his mental and physical health has put a massive drain on our relationship. He has depression and crohns. All of which I try to be accommodating for, considering I'm not picnic with my mental health. I also grew up taking care of my eldest sister with Cerebral Palsy, so I'm no stranger to disability being shitty.
That being said, he is constantly in between jobs and will take prolonged amounts of time off. Sometimes it's because of his crohns, and others because of his depression. I want to say I'm understanding, but maybe it's my anxiety or ego. Whatever it is. I go to work. I might miss a day here and there, but I still go. Last year I was suicidal and I still went to work, because work equals rent which equals me not having to move back home to my emotionally abusive mother.
Anyway, I haven't felt in love with him for some time. I feel like he is an emotional leech and I don't feel like we're in an equal relationship. I can't help shake the fact that his lack of ambition makes me not want to be with him. He doesn't want to do anything. And it makes me feel like he's dragging me down with him.
Now, I started our relationship as an open one. I had realized that monogamy just didn't work for me. We've still been mainly closed, with me having occasional flings with female friends (I am pan/queer). He's ok with this for the most part. Recently one of my friends male partners and I hooked up (they are also open) and we realized that we fill the holes our partners don't. Mainly he allows me to be social and get out my impulsive needs. While I help him deal with the fact that his partner isn't very intimate or timely. Neither of us has plans to steal the other away. In fact, the few times we've been together have been so refreshing because I don't have to care about someone. Like sure, I care about him as a friend. But it just makes me feel like ""wow being single would be great. no one to worry about. you could have your own space. not feeling like you're walking on eggshells around your boyfriends depression"".
I'm trying to figure out if I can change my mind on my current boyfriend. If he does get better at going to work and maybe pushing for better work. If his depression meds help and he learns better coping mechanisms than shutting down, playing video games, and relying on me like his mother.
Is it just because of this new relationship with my friend that has my brain all in a tizzy?! I've wanted to end things before, but always thought they would get better.
I've also been obsessing over this whole situation and what to do, which I think is pushing my to think of the negative and not any of the positives.
I love him, but with how he is acting it makes me feel like a chump. Like, here's my child of a boyfriend who doesn't come to family functions and doesn't want to do anything with his life. When he is overbearing and attached it makes me uncomfortable because I don't feel like I have space. When he is distant and depressed I think he is made at me and it makes me suicidal and want to self harm. I don't like where he is going with his life. He doesn't have any plans and has zero ambition and I don't know if I want to be with someone who works in a call center all their life.",12Jul2017,4

* 600 mg Neurontin
* 400 mg Seroquel XR
* 50 mg Topamax (just resumed after two weeks of tapering at 25mg/week)
* 60 mg Vyvanse

I'm frustrated because I feel like I've never been more miserable in my life, sometimes to the point where I even pine for the days when all I had to deal with was horrible OCD (the initial reason I was hospitalized and medicated) every year or two.  Of course my logical side tells me I don't want to go back to those days; as bright as the brightest moments were, the dark moments were really, *really* dark.  Clearly I can never go back.  But often, when I'm alone, I look through rose-coloured glasses at the best of those times and can't shake the disturbing thought that my happiest days are behind me.  Everything ahead seems grey, oppressive, more of the same, world without end.

I think back to two happy years of my life often: my tenth-grade year of high school and the year after I got out of the hospital for the first time.  There was energy to those times: I had girlfriends, I travelled places, I have no unhappy memories.  I just felt *free*.

Now I live in a boring, cut-on-the-lines suburb with Walmarts and Targets because I can't afford to live anywhere else.  

I have two jobs: one that I hate but can't quit because I have some debt, and one my TA-ship that I risk losing if I can't find a dissertation topic by the end of the summer.  

I feel like the American powers-that-be have come to be custom-built for the manufacture of national misery.  

My friends assume I don't like them because I'm an introvert who is afraid of talking on the phone.  

I've come to realize that I'm gay, but I have no boyfriend and am at the age where cute guys write you off because you're the fat, ugly cat in a litter of kittens for adoption.

I can't get myself to do anything productive and usually end my days feeling that I've wasted them.  

And over the past few days I have been having suicidal thoughts, which my psychiatrist says are due to the change in Topamax -- and while I'm anti-suicide in theory, I indulged the thoughts to a scary degree for a couple of moments.  I don't want to kill myself but worry that I will change my mind in a moment of weakness -- brain chemistry is a fickle thing.

I am sure that there is happiness to be found near me, and that there's happiness to be found *somewhere* even if I'm wrong about it being nearby.  I've thought about making drastic life changes -- moving to another country, making a living out of a hobby I develop, blowing in the wind like so many twentysomethings seem able to do on a moment's notice.  I just know that I'm not happy *now* and haven't been in a while, and I'd like some reassurance that I'll look back someday and tell myself that all this was worth the struggle.",12Jul2017,1
60,"Hey, so I'm looking for some kind of advice right now. Anything that will help. I'm so sorry if this is a jumbled mess, but my mind is on overdrive right now. 
I was diagnosed with depression two years ago and have been taking Effexor 75mg for a few months now. I was doing great from about Feb-May because I was at school and have a few really amazing friends. I've been home for the summer since May and it seems like my mental health has been going to hell since then. I only have one real friend at home and he is my best friend. Problem is that we used to date. I go through periods where I feel like I'm over him, I really do. Then there are times when I still hope for something with him. We are never going to get back together. He has made that really clear, but we are each other's best friends and have no intention of changing that. 
These past few weeks have been rough because I kind of just go to work and come back home and feel so alone because my friend can't always be there with me 24/7. I get into these funks where I feel like no one cares about me and it just makes me hate myself to the point where I want to hurt myself. I used to see a therapist at school and I've seen tree different ones in the past year and they all make me feel like crap about myself and don't help me. My friend is at his wits end because he only wants to help me and I just feel so defeated. It doesn't help that I have a horrible family life and my friend started talking to a new girl (I don't know if I can stay friends with him anymore if he starts dating her and that's going to make my mental health even worse). It drives me to the point of wanting to hurt myself over this girl. 
If anyone has any advice, please help. ",12Jul2017,2

63,"So, she's 17. We live in the UK. This has been happening on and off for a couple of years now. She's been to a therapist for anxiety and depression, her depression seems to have been gone for a few months but her anxiety is still around.

An example of the kind of thing I'm talking about happened today. She's been having trouble with her teeth hurting, so I asked if she'd been brushing them, and she said not usually. I suggested I would remind her at a certain time (like after dinner), and then she said she can't brush them after dinner, that she wants to brush them later (inconveniently, at a time I can't remind her).

I asked why not, she said she just can't brush them early in the evening, but that she could brush them late in the day or early in the morning, which is when the dentist says to brush them. When we've talked about similar things, she's said she has no control over it. For example, she says she has no control over what time she goes to bed. She says I just don't get it, which is obviously true.

It's really frustrating for me. I don't understand it at all, and she seems to have no ability to explain it. Any conversation about it just devolves into Her: ""I just can't do it"" Me: ""How can you possibly not be able to do that?"" until one or both of us gets annoyed. 

Does this sound like any kind of mental problem? Is it related to anxiety?

I'd love it if anybody could help me understand, or give me any questions to ask her to figure this out. Thanks. :)",12Jul2017,9

66,"I feel like I'm stable like my mental health is fine because I pretty much compare anything I go through to a bad episode of depression that lasted 8/9 months a few years back. but then the more I learn the more I'm scared I'm just going about and living and not facing my mental health issues. I have on going sleep issues which are usually absent when I have a job, and normally come about when I don't have much to do in the day.  My mood pattern varies, it can go from feeling really motivated and productive and very chatty and creative, to severely bored and with no motivation and no emotion really, lack of excitement for anything and just intense irritability and frustration,. And then occasional short lasting depressive episodes that just make it difficult to do fuck all but these are occasional I get these like 3 times a year, can be triggered by change, lack of sleep. I guess I just settle for feeling pretty much fucking bored and unsatisfied all the time because I'm not in a dooming depressive episode and I don't feel helpless, just pretty much flat out bored, but will raising an anti depressant dose help do you think, or is this just a personality trait. I know to be truly happy I need a balance of purpose and meaning, that is integrated into my routine somehow, structure, alone time to relax or create, time to party an go out with friends/ and then romantic affection. Without a combination of all these things I feel like it is impossible to truly feel myself. I know that I'm waiting to start drama school, so the structure and purpose and meaning part is kind of awaiting, I have creative alone time a bit too often ATM, I need more time with friends but I just cba to see people unless it's going out or having fun, but currently I'm just craving affection all the time, I am literally awaiting on a boyfriend to be happy while I wait to start drama school. Last summer I had a boyfriend and I was a lot less fucking moany and irritable, looked forward to more. Life isn't unbearable but I just feel like the only highs are coming from going out drinking and events with friends, the rest is just waiting. I do try and take care of myself, eat well, don't sit in bed all day, and be productive with my hobbies, but I'm so sick of this cycle of shit, my life has just felt utterly aimless for nearly a year, I just want to be told this is normal for someone in my circumstances.- A bit of background to my year;
Uni for 3 months and I quit because i wanted to do acting it was not contributing to my purpose and meaning, plus had an awful set of house mates. Looked for a job until Feb end of Jan maybe? But quit May because it was just fucking horrifically boring and all I could do was overthink and it made me unhappy, I looked for a job for after this but nothing was coming back so I waited until summer to start another one I was offered, started nearly 2 months ago maybe less, I actually enjoyed this job, kept me busy, wasn't boring and was nice hours, HOWEVER, my boss had expectations of me I could not meet, I used to do shifts feeling like things were going fine and then he would critisize me at the end of my shift, and it would make me anxious working, and just felt like everything I did was being judged and analysed and the stress of that made feel weighed down so I have handed in my notice, I felt fine last week because I had plans and worked twice in the week, but he never gave me weekday shifts only weekends other than last week, so now I'm bored. This whole summer That id imagined to lift my spirits and be filled with fun has turned out to be the boring and aimless cycle I spent the rest of my year in, my friends haven't broken up yet, and a boy I'm waiting to come home from up north hasn't yet, but I feel constantly waiting for something better. Is it just normal to feel pretty bored n shit due to life circumstances and personal desires or do you think there's an issue with my mental health such as a mild depression or my ADHD that could be chemical. It's just been going on for too long now I feel frustrated and simply unhappy. I know how bad depression is and how much it just impacted my life, and even if this isn't the same doesn't mean I'm content or happy. Last time I felt truly content was a year ago, last summer.

67,"I wrote a novel so if you read through, thank you.  
TL;DR at the bottom.  
  
Yesterday I had a new appointment with another new psych and I'm worried that I fucked it up again.   
I'm worried that I've unintentionally impeded my treatment like I always do.  
I've ended up with a million diagnoses over the years and have never received the right treatment. I think its partially due to having problems expressing what is and has been problematic for me.  
  
I also made a possibly unfair assumption that he was going to read my file a bit before meeting with me.  
He said I was being really vague and I mentioned there were some details within the file that I had written out.  
He said he wanted to hear it directly from me.  
I should've brought my own paperwork but didn't since they are in the file.  
  
Not an unfair request but I clam up/forget and never know where to start.   
Its incredibly difficult to know what's important to say or not.  
It doesn't help that I'm very afraid of older men due to past trauma.  
  
Towards the beginning of the appointment he started to say that I appear have just severe anxiety and depression, not bipolar or psychotic problems.  
  
For reference in my adult life, I have been DX'd with (C)PTSD, BPD, MDD w/ psychotic features, BP2 w/depressive psychotic features and a mild neurocognitive disorder.  
(Some of those DX were given together, some were by different providers.)  
  
My therapist now is thinks I have CPTSD and BP2 W/ psychotic features or schizoaffective disorder.  
So ""just"" anxiety felt a little invalidating.  
  
At that point I started feeling really overwhelmed at the thought of being misdiagnosed and dissmissed again.  
I tried really hard to give some detail and going over past diagnosis.  
How I and my new therapist thinks I've been misdisgnosed a lot and ended up there.  

  
He said I was doing a better job at explaining and was getting a clearer picture. That maybe with time I'd feel more comfortable sharing.  
He agreed to put me on back lamotrigine and see if we need anything more later. Lamotrigine was honestly was my biggest goal.  
  
I don't think I was very clear or upfront about what my psychotic symptoms are but they aren't too prevalent or distressing at the moment.  
  
I know I'm over thinking it but I feel so worried. I've dealt with misdiagnosis and the wrong treatment for years.  
Every psych I've seen tells me different shit and its frustrating.  
  
I feel like I kind of saved the appointment somewhat and that it will be ok. I have an appointment with my therapist today and I hope she has some insight.  
I just really want to be taken seriously and not written off.  
  
TL;DR: Basically the title and has it lead you to repeated and new misdiagnoses? Do you feel like it has before or does inpede your treatment?",12Jul2017,17

74,"When I was younger I used to see people that weren't there. Usually in odd/dangerous situations, one example was a guy on crutches crossing a road as a car was coming. I saw it clear as anything and when I turned my head back as my car turned I saw that there was no one there at all, not even a car. This happened a few times on different occasions. I also used to hear voices, like people calling my name, sometimes people I know but not always. I've suffered from Depression for a few years and I'm 19 now. My depression has been getting worse and I'm starting to hear the voices again and see people, although it isn't as frequent. The latest was hearing my mum shouting my name, as if she was in trouble, when she was just in the kitchen cooking and didn't say anything. Could these visions and hearing voices occurrences be due to another mental illness, or is it a common thing? Thanks for reading x",12Jul2017,3
75,"I was watching a tv show where a particularly unlikeable lead character ends up acting crazy and psychotic because of the fact that her boyfriend is leaving her. It's bizarre but I empathized with that character more than I should. 

The desperation of begging someone to stay with you. Feeling like you're going to die, explode, without them. 

I've been there. I don't know why it happened , but I've felt that way. 

When a relationship literally pushes you to feeling like you're insane. 

Wanting to be with someone that causes you pain, and pushes you into such an extreme state of emotional pain that you hurt yourself. That you sit there wanting to die. That you feel your sanity being slowly pulled out of your body. Then desperately trying to re-establish normalcy. Buying them things to convince them to stay with you. Doing things to reiterate that you are needed and irreplaceable.

They leave and don't come back for hours and you sit there waiting, losing your mind, wishing for someone to come and comfort you, but all you get is their roommate telling you that you need to take your drama somewhere else because they're going to have guests. 

When my SO came back, he gave me a copy of an REBT guide to irrational thoughts. Got angry at me when I pointed out the behaviors he exhibited from it.


And after all of that, they leave you anyways. Tell you that they need to be away from you to get better. 

I felt like a child, alone and afraid and helpless. I cried all night. I left the next day and I was bawling. Unsure if I'll ever see him again. 

They show the lead character having a psychotic break but they don't show just how toxic the relationship was in the first place. They don't show the circumstances that push someone to act so extreme. ",12Jul2017,2

77,"Hello everybody,

I don't really know how to start this, i never really talked about it.

Everything startet when i was still a kid. I had numerous nightmares every night and a lot of sleep paralysis. This came to a point where i didn't want to sleep anymore and my mother send me to a therapist. I dont remember anything about that session, but afterwards i didn't have a single dream of any kind for a few years. They came back sporadically but it was never the same as before. 

I had big depression episodes last year with serious self-harm and suicidal thoughts, but i was able to recover with a big change in daily routines and some months spend overseas, far away from everything. 
I startet exercising and eating healthy and thought that everything was gonna be alright. 

But soon i noticed that its not gonna be that easy. 
I only feel like myself and in control when i am in a bad mood or depressed, so i startet to trigger these moments myself. 

If not, i feel like my body is not controlled by me in everyday life. My real conciousness is detached and put away in a far corner of my mind, where i just watch everything like in a movie.
The feeling of being detached grows everyday. 
I can't look at me in the mirror anymore because the person standing there is not me. Not the real one. And it is always staring at me.
It scared me so much that i just stopped doing it subconsiously. Whenever i stand infront of the bathroom mirror, i look everywhere but my face. Even if i don't try not to look i never look.
By now i am afraid in the dark and i see shadows and movement at the edge of my field of view that let me jump so often. 
I often hide in my room, only with enough light to see a little and with nothing but the cinema inside my head, where i really like to go. 
When not occupied in activities i just sit quietly in my room and wander around in my thoughts, sometimes doing things that i don't remember afterwards. You can't tell how often i lose my phone.

I often look at my hands to see if i am dreaming (i can't see them in my dreams), 
but its never the case.

When i feel depressed all of it vanishes. I am back in control and it feels so nice. But those episodes don't last very long and i'm put back in my place. Then the 'normal', not thinking me comes into play.

This might sound schizophrenic, but they are both me. Or i am both. 

And very confused.",12Jul2017,1
