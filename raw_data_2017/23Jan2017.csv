1,I have MDD and I literally just felt my depressive episode start a few minutes ago. I hurt all over and feel so much sorrow it's unbearable. But I'm in college and I really need to maintain motivation. Any tips?,23Jan2017,2,
2,"So let me begin by saying that I know I sound absolutely ridiculous and self-absorbed and even petty by struggling with this. However, let me explain. 

I have struggled with extreme depression and anxiety for my entire life. Even as a young child, even though I didn't know what was technically going on with me, I struggled. 

When I started college, I had my first full blown manic episode. I was diagnosed Bipolar I, and at that point, the seemingly never-ending line of medications began. I had horrible side effects to any of the ones that helped in any way. I had become adjusted to the idea that I would never know life without depression.

About six months ago I heard about TMS treatment and decided to give it a shot. It ended up working better for me than I could have imagined, and I was thrilled. 

I have been not depressed for the first time in my life which has been great, but I am quickly realizing that I don't know *how* to not be depressed or incredibly. I'm not sure if this will make sense to anyone else, but I had spent my entire life adjusting to surviving amidst the anxiety and depression. 

Has anyone else been through this? 

I'm very thankful that the treatment worked, but I honestly feel more lost and alone than ever. I had a lot of books on how to try and cope with the depression and anxiety, but I have no idea what to do from here. 

How do I learn to think/feel without the anxiety and depression?",23Jan2017,1,

7,"Okay, so the highlights of my younger life are in the title. I'll elaborate in a moment. But the real issue is that I have no clue how to interact with my peers. I am so socially inept that even adults have resorted to the same pranks and hurtful comments that my peers made towards me when I was in school growing up. I just turned 40 in November, and have only fully accepted my sexuality for a few years. But a successful relationship seems absolutely impossible for me, and sometimes the sadness seems like too much to handle.

Here's the details: I was born in 76. When my mother was pregnant, she was extremely ill and near death for various reasons. When I was born I immediately exhibited problems seeing and hearing. I never responded to people, other than by touch. In addition to that, I was constantly sick. I was in and out of the hospital a lot as a child.

My mother's illnesses and my own limitations and illnesses were too much for my father, so he left when I was five and moved all the way to the other side of the country. I later learned that he had a relationship with a girl (16 years younger than him) while still married to my mother. That girl moved down there soon after my parents divorced and they immediately got married. I never saw him, except for a few weeks during the summer each year. I also later learned that he never had to pay child support either, because he and my mother were in a business together at the time. He just gave her his half of the business. Easy out.

About a year later, my mother remarried. This man terrorized my entire childhood until I ran away at age 16. Believe it or not, I eventually ended up living with my father and step-mother. As hurt as I was by my father, he was at least better than living with my step-father and weak mother. He physically beat me and emotionally tormented me to the point that I left adolescence without a shred of confidence.

My health conditions improved. I had several surgeries on my eyes and ears, and was constantly in and out of doctors' offices and hospitals, but I eventually improved dramatically during and after puberty. During my teens, my eyesight continued to improve dramatically and my hearing, although still is far from perfect, improved enough to function adequately. But the damage was done pretty early on. During my younger, developmental years I was alone and never interacted with boys my age. During elementary school, as things started to improve with my vision and hearing, I was able to talk with my peers, but I struggled with the social rules and interacting especially with boys my age. They perplexed me. I seemed so weak and fragile physically and emotionally compared to them. And, as you can imagine, that made me an easy target. And I got it pretty bad at times. I mostly learned to hide really well. I lived in the shadows as best I could.

I developed crushes for my male peers pretty early on. Early sexual experiences with other boys, mostly on the order of experimentation, only further fueled the flame of my desires for male companionship and relationship, and as I eventually learned, sexual contact.

BUT....before you start freaking out about all of that.....by the time I was a very young teen boy, I had everything under control. How? Because by that time I was already thoroughly enmeshed in the Mormon culture. I apologize if you are sympathetic to the Mormon religion, but I have recently left it and see things SO much clearer now. Back when I was growing up in the Mormon church, I was taught self-loathing, self-hate, unbelievable guilt and denial of my own sexuality.

Because I was dealing with constant abuse, emotional and physical turmoil by my peers at school, religious indoctrination and health issues, I never acted out on my feelings for other males. I never experienced the enjoyment of connecting with a true crush during these important years.

Later on, I eventually went on a mission for the Mormon church, experimented with a few male companions during those few years, but returned determined to make everyone else in my life happy and pleased with me. So, I dated girls for a long time. Several years. It was miserable. I never connected with anyone. It was impossible for me. During this time, me being gay was beginning to be much more clear to me. I eventually came out to my family when I was 25. They loved me, but treated it as a disease that had to be attacked and cured. I went through years of therapy designed to change my sexual orientation. Never happened. But, still determined to please everyone else except myself, I finally ran into a woman who made it extremely easy for me to date. She, as I later learned, was emotionally damaged and needy. She made it obvious to me that she liked me and wanted to have a relationship with me. (As a side-note, reading social cues was nearly impossible for me, so understanding when a girl liked me was crazy impossible for me. So, when she just right away told me, it was easy.) We got married after dating for only 4 months.

Fast-forward to 2015. I have three daughters. I am again going through tremendous emotional abuse, this time from my wife, who it turns out is bipolar and has borderline personality disorder. After going through all of this and having been gas-lighted by her during my entire 13 year marriage, I file for divorce. I was literally choosing between killing myself or leaving. I know that my wife would never do anything to hurt our children. And my children would be able to get to know me SO much better outside of that unhealthy marriage. I would be a much better father to them in a better environment without their mother.

Now, 20 months later, I am officially divorced. My children are doing SO much better. Our relationship is amazing. They have really been able to experience life with an attentive, loving father now. They will be fine, although I am not oblivious to their problems that they will have later on because of the divorce.

But, naturally, I am wanting so badly to have a relationship. As a gay man, I yearn and crave the attention of another man. But, it is something that has almost never happened for me. And I worry that it never will. Here is why:

1) Although I have quit the Mormon church, I live with the effects of having lived in that ""cult""-like environment still. I deal with self-loathing and internalized homophobia on a daily basis.

2) I do not know how to interact normally, still, with men (gay or straight). I come across as stand-offish, shy, scared and without any confidence. I want so badly to correct this. But I have no context of understanding for how to deal with this issue, as it has defined my entire life.

3) Sexually, I am attracted to men. Emotionally, though, I am attracted to women. I can connect with them in ways that I never can with a man. I understand that this is a common thing for many gay men. But, not having been in a gay relationship of any depth, I cannot fathom how to emotionally connect with a man.

**Oh my God, people. I can't believe how long this is! I so appreciate you reading this if you got this far. You are a generous soul. Thank you. Any pertinent comments, suggestions and help are more than appreciated.**",23Jan2017,21,
8,"I have a brother who is driving my family crazy. 

He thinks everyone is trying too poison him or kill him in some way. He stayed at my mom's house the other night and induced vomiting at least three times because he thought she might be trying to poison him. 

He is currently homeless and can't seem to keep a job for more than a few weeks.

His ten year girlfriend recently broke up with him because he had a history of being verbally and physically abusive. 

Not only is he stressing out my family, but given his history, I am worried for all of our physical safety. I have been triple-locking my doors and checking my windows every day to make sure they're locked.

He does have anger issues, some particularly at me. 

I have a wife and kid and am concerned that he might try to harm someone out of desperation. 

We've tried giving him contact information for homeless shelters and counseling services, but he never goes through with anything. 

My mom's blood pressure is 150/91 because she is always stressed out. 

Is there any way to force him into a psychiatric hospital? 

I know it sounds horrible, but I'm seriously thinking about getting my FOID card, a handgun, and a security system to protect my house.

I'm probably over-thinking some of it, but I don't feel safe around him. And I don't think anyone else does either.

For legal advice (not professional or official, I know), I live in Illinois. ",23Jan2017,3,

Sometimes if I'm really late taking my depression medicine it'll make me feel really sick after I do take it.  Such as electric shocks in my head and really hallucination type nightmares.  As you can imagine this is really stressful when I'm dealing with it.  Also there are times when I'm upset or freaking out about something and it's difficult for me to relax and think logically.  I've used suicide hotlines in the past when I was suicidal but I was wondering if there's any resources for me to contact someone during these less urgent episodes.  Obviously my life isn't on the line, i just have difficulty dealing with them.  Anything y'all can suggest?  Even if it's not a hotline, if it's just something you do that helps you relax and cope.

32,"This is going to take some explaining so bear with me.  I'm not sure whether it's psychological or neurological, rooted in PTSD or possible BPD but I am exploring all those avenues currently to try and sort it out.    
    
To boil it down, I'm not feeling emotion properly.   It's all across the board, positive and negative. I'm not completely detached (I am aware of how my mind is 'trying' to feel) but none of them truly connect. I get the message ""you are currently happy/annoyed/sad (not all at once), please act accordingly"" but the feelings are very blunted.  I have had significant traumas in my life (home invasions, death of family and friends including finding my Dad's body in his flat after he committed suicide, numerous instances of child sexual abuse and more as an adult) but I have come a long way since.  I have a lot to show for my life. I can feel the vague semblance of happiness (and the other emotions) and the cues are there to how I ought to be feeling, it just fails to fully materialize and completely register as an emotion. I essentially am the person I've wanted to be, but it doesn't feel as meaningful as it should.    
    
My girlfriend fortunately is very understanding of this, she knows I love her, I know I do so she doesn't take it personally or assume I'm being cold and so on.  It's getting very frustrating and intrusive.  I haven't cried on over a year.  Not even when my close friend died this New Years.  Unlike all the other psychological problems and shortcomings I had in my life, this has just stumped me.  I'm trying and continue to try just about everything but I don't know where to go from here.  In the meantime, I am at least keeping the seat warm, continuing down the road I assume I would be if I didn't have this problem under the assumption that I'll feel normal again eventually and won't have wasted any time.  I would appreciate any insight into what is going on here.",23Jan2017,1,

It happens at any moment, whether I'm at home and bored or am having the time of my life, it hits and I feel like I'm in a dream and I just want to die. I'm not depressed but I don't know what this sensation occurs (around once a week).

When anxiety hits hard, most times I turn into a damn animal. 

Last night I ended up going to my Ex's house (our house) to pick up all the things I left there to help her, because she had posted something online about me that she didn't think I would see, then when I asked her about it she blocked me from all communications. Ended up being more like a fucked up angry mental breakdown. I actually applaud myself for keeping my cool as well as I did, even after getting spit in my face.

I think this might be really weird, and I don't know what to do about it since I'm going to be starting college in the fall. I can't be in college and have a blanket like this, but I can't bear to be apart from it. Also, I still sleep with stuffed animals.

I'm a 18 year old.

Well, despite my financial situation, problems, difficulties, desires... I live happy. I'm an introvert which likes to socialize with people, whose future and goals are like mine. Sadly, I've got no one this type to socialize. I beat major depression few years ago, panic disorder, anxiety disorder (without medications or therapies). 
Lately, I feel that I'm hypervigilant, being exposed to 3-4 traumas last 3 years, which is obviously logical, it bothers a little bit though.

Anyway, long story short:
I like to exploit people for my personal benefits. I feel a little bit guilty, but not that much, it doesn't matter.
Manipulate with them, manipulate with everyone just to get what I need, and, it worked and it's working. Those who are affected, only like 0.1% of them knew what I did, except this percentage, everyone thinks it's okay.
It's not something that I can really get caught, I thought a lot about it.

I am aware that without appropriate tests and mental health specialists, I can't be diagnosed but I just want opinions. I know this is lack of empathy and it's not OK for third party. And, it's like you get used  to it, you crave for it because it brings pleasure. Perhaps dopamine?

Am I okay (even though I feel so) or I'm not? What do you think?
