0,"Hmm, I guess I will share my experience with depression, bipolar, anxiety, and hypo mania altogether. I have not yet been completely and precisely diagnosed with a specific mental illness besides depression &amp; anxiety since I have been all over the place. Anyways, here it goes. About 2 months ago I fell into a bad depression. Then right after that I fell into mania. ""What do you mean by mania?"", you may be asking. What I mean by mania is a thought came into my mind about what the purpose of life is, I couldn't find a purpose to have parents or  be a parent. No purpose to relationships of any kind. Like, literally, I did not get the point of it. Like I have not enjoyed my life one bit since then. By now I feel completely dead inside. I also had OCD violent thoughts which scared the shit out of me. My mind is tired and I feel like i might go crazy, which I don't want, but it's how I feel. I really don't know what to do. I've talked to psychiatrists, I've been taking anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, &amp; anti-psychotic meds. But I just can't take it any longer. I feel like if I live longer on this earth I will end up mentally insane &amp; just become a burden to the world. WTF, I don't know what to do. My mind has been racing with all kinds of existential questions, which lead to other and so on. I've had my mom as support but I don't want to burden her anymore. I am 20 fucking years old and I am going nuts. WTF, this was a 180 degree turn in my life. I just don't know what is left or next. I just can't. Has anyone lived anything similar. How have you lived with it, how is your life like?

13,"I have depression and I hear voices. I have always thought I hid it pretty well that I have auditory hallucinations. I mean, everyone has always acted surprised when they find out.

But recently the voices have been more irritating and people (only those who already know about the voices) have been asking if I'm okay.  When they do, I always freeze and try to figure out what indication I might be giving that the voices are bad, but I can't figure it out. I've tried saying I'm fine, and why are they asking? But they just respond by telling me it looks like I'm having a hard time.

So, short if talking to oneself, what are some visible signs that a person is having auditory hallucinations ? I want to be aware so I can stop making it so obvious to people. I hate drawing attention to myself.",12Jun2017,2

21,"Sorry for formatting, am on mobile!

The title says it all, I am confused and a little lacking in the self confidence. I *think* I have some social anxiety, or maybe general anxiety. I am 17, so still in high school. Whenever I am in school I am always freaking out that someone in looking at me, if there is whispers or giggles it's about me, and even if there is no indication of something amiss I'm still being judged. I'm always panicking that my 'friends' (because I'm not sure if they are, or they are and I'm paranoid) hate me. Is that normal teenage angst?

      I also think I'm depressed, but I'm afraid to ask to see a therapist/psychiatrist/psychologist because what if it isn't. Then I'm wasting my family's money and time. Also, if I am fucked up how do I ask my parents to take me to see a doctor? Just the thought freaks me out.",12Jun2017,0
22,"To make a long story short, starting at around 13/14 I struggled heavily with my  mental health, having a poor self image, being constantly depressed and anxious, self harming, and I had an eating disorder. Around the time I started struggling to get out of bed at all in the morning, I really mustered up the courage to say to my mom, ""I've been really sad like all the time,"" to which she quickly brushed off replying, ""It's probably hormones."" I remember this moment vividly because it lead to me then beginning to hide and bottle up all of my awful feelings which fueled an emotional rollercoaster that was my adolescent years. I suppressed my feelings more and more as my mother often would say things about depression being something that a person can change themselves, happiness being a choice, mind over matter, that whole schtick.

Anyway, I'm older now and in college and while I still struggle with my mental health occasionally and have my down times, I'd say I have gotten a pretty good handle on my mental health; especially since it's always been a dirty, shameful secret I've kept to myself. Well recently, my younger brother's doctor stated that he believes my brother could be at risk for depression and immediately my mom was worried sick. She's been talking to me about it a lot and telling me how worried she is, how upset about it she is, and that it makes her nervous because ""you know mental health issues run in my family"". Now don't get me wrong, I love my brother to death and if he has any struggles I'm glad he's being supported and listened to. Just the other day I suggested to my mom taking his to talk to a therapist, even if he only wants to go once just so he can maybe make some sense of anything negative he's been feeling. But I guess I'm almost jealous in a way that my mom is so loving and caring towards him, which makes me feel god awful inside because my brother deserves all the love and care in the world.

I've been doing pretty well mentally but I've been starting to unravel and struggle from this because I feel so unloved and uncared about. It just sucks that when I was crying myself to sleep every night, self harming, starving myself for days, and having hyperventilating panic attacks I was ignored or made to feel like my feelings weren't valid. Or when I'm unable to get up from the couch or even shower for days I'm called lazy and made fun of/laughed at by my mom, but now I have my mom and brother trying to tell me how awful depression and anxiety are. I know this situations shouldn't make me angry, but I'm just upset that I was made to feel so invalid and unsupported that I've been building up the strength for 3 years to go see a psychologist at my school to be properly treated.

I've thought about writing a letter explaining some of my feelings to my mom (though I wouldn't word it to be filled with anger) as I know I wouldn't be able to get these words out in an articulate fashion by speaking to her, but I don't want to come across as being mad that she cares about my brother. I also will probably never have to guts to tell her about my personal struggles and I don't want her to beat herself up over it because what's done is done, but it just fucking hurts.

I guess I came here to just kind of get these feelings out as they're eating my alive to the point that I can't sleep, and I have no one to talk to about this. Also if anyone can give their opinions if I should try to express some of this to my mom it would help out a ton.",12Jun2017,3
23,"Let me preface this by saying I have no history of abuse or mistreatment in my childhood or past. I'm 19 and nothing even remotely traumatizing has really taken place in my life that would serve as an excuse for my actions, other than maybe my parents got divorced when I was 8. But no, for the most part I've grown up in a good, loving environment.

So, what I really came here to say. I've been dating this girl for a couple months. She has a small female shih tzu that lives at her place. She's a cute little dog, not mean or really particularly skittish. In fact she was honestly a very sweet dog and liked me a lot when I first met her. Let me also say I do also consider myself a ""dog person."" Ive grown up with dogs all my life both big and small and never had the slightest thoughts of hurting or abusing them. I've always loved my dogs and still can't fathom hurting them. But for whatever reason I really, *really* wanted to hurt this dog in particular. It started where when my girlfriend wasn't in the room I would just knock her off the couch or smack her head really hard. She was just so small and light that smacking and shoving her around was for whatever reason really fun and pleasurable to me. It started to get worse where I would put my hand around her neck and squeeze to choke her a bit or hit her really hard with pillows and stuff like that. I still have thoughts about picking her up and throwing her on the ground or punching her or smothering her.

It was so strange and even though I knew it was wrong it felt so strangely good to me that I would do it really every time I went over to my girlfriend's house. It was so bad I could feel my teeth clench with the urge to hit or hurt the dog when I was around it. The fact that the dog would get so scared of me after but then also still try to come lay on me or love me after was also what I liked about it, as creepy as it is for me to type that. The dumb thing would still try to come lay on my chest and suddenly smacking it across the face to see the fear in its eyes was a almost like a rush for me. I know how awful this all sounds but I really, truly cannot imagine hurting any other animals like my own dogs or let alone people in this same manner. Its just this one, dumb dog for some reason. And in all honesty, I don't want to kill it either. Its just the domination aspect of it I guess and just how innocent, small and dumb it is just makes me want to hurt it. 

I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this post but I genuinely want help and to know why I feel pleasure when I do this. I really don't feel very bad for the dog either when I do it. In a weird way I feel like she deserves it just for being so vulnerable and dopey. And when it starts to get scared I just want to hurt it more. Is it just that I want to feel dominant? Or is this really a mental health issue. Any help and thoughts are appreciated.",12Jun2017,21

29,"To start off I'll tell you guys I work as a paramedic is a small town USA. I'm working towards my Masters in Social Work. I also suffer from depression, anxiety and PTSD. 
Yesterday, I went to work like every other weekend. We got called to a person that was having some mental health problems and may or may no have taken an over dose of medication. After talking to this person for 20 or so minutes we leave and go to our local bandaid station ( little ER) I have seen it many time but this time it struck a nerve. We brought this person in that was crying, not doing anything wrong and was just needing help. Because said person wouldn't talk they treated this them like shit. She would answer most yes and no questions. But that wasn't what hit me. The doc ( who I have known for a few years) literally man handled her head to look in her eyes ears and mouth. He didn't even bother to ask her anything! He just walked in and started pushing her head around. When if he would have asked this person would have moved and been cooperative. They just didn't want to talk. I was so mad. This person who needed ( and had tried to get help more than once) help and you are treating them like a piece of trash. Personally if I ever had to go to the ER for mental health issues, I'm going to feel like shit anyway, I don't need to be treated like I don't matter because I have mental health problems. 
I have been with the ambulance service for a while now and I have seen it time and time again. We bring in someone who wants to hurt themselves or needs help and doesn't know any other way of getting it, they treat them like trash. 
The mental health system around me is so broken. All these people think, because they don't have depression or anything they are better than them. They all know I suffer from mental health problems and they treat me like they are better than me. I have never once had a crisis. But the fact that I'm on medication to help me, that makes them better. The fact that I do not hide that I'm on medication, makes me a lesser person. Why? None of us asked to have any of these mental health problems! Why treat someone having a broken arm with love and compassion, then turn around and treat the person who is suicidal and WANTING your help to make them better and treat them like they are lesser because their pain is invisible. Their illness is invisible. They wouldn't be there 90% of the time if they didn't want help. 
This is why people hide. This is why the stigma is so strong. Because it is easier to belittle someone that you don't understand instead of trying to learn from them. It's easier to blow them off as an attention seeking person instead of actually asking. Ya ok if the ER is busy that's one thing. Yesterday and most days (small town) not that busy where someone (before they call mental health) can take 2 minutes and try to connect with them and earn their trust. 
Not going to lie, I'm guilty of being jaded and judging a person before even getting to the person. Even after being diagnosed with my own mental health problems. I'm not perfect and I don't expect them to be, but this isn't a one time thing. It's an every time thing. 
I also have been on the receiving end of my little towns stigma reinforcing thinking. I post on my private social media page about mental health issues and my personal story. Well I guess someone decided that because I'm on medication I was not competent enough to do my job. Mind you at the time of this I had not had a panic attack in about 6 months and my depression was very much under control and I was not having any issues. I'm not sure why these people didn't come to me, but they went to my boss. Let's just say my boss doesn't have the best employee/boss skills. She preceded to yelled and belittle me in front of my coworkers. She called me ""people like you"". Referring to people that have mental health crisis. People like me? I had never been thrown out in like that. I have never been singled out and belittled because of something I didn't ask for and I can not help. That was 4 months ago. I still have not healed. 
I know this rant has been all over this place. Sorry. Just a lot of built up anger. Please no hateful things if you chose to comment.  If you don't like it just pass on. I need support not judgement or meanness. I'm just tired of this stigma that is over us. ",12Jun2017,43

33,"During the 4 year relationship (which ended almost 4 months ago, when she broke up with me) thing started to happen with me.
I fell madly in lowe with this girl 6 years ago and have been trying to get her to be my gf for 2 years. Furing that time she always told me to wait and maybe some day it would happen. I was always on her side, no matter what. I saw her falling in love with some other guy, getting her heart broken and so on. We became best friends but I wanted more. I starteg getting these mood swings. I would get very upset in a matter of minutes and than again normal, good mood in few hours. It usually happened when it felt like she started to distance herself from me.
One day I tried my luck and she said yes. It is probably necesarry to mention thad she gave me one ultimatum. I had to choose between going to flight school or her. I chose her and went to university. And also she demamded that I stop talking to my other good friend who was also female. It was beautifull although hings were not how I imagine they would be. We live few miles apart but have been seeing eachother every few weeks and after a year it became every few months. She never had time for me and these attacks started to appear again from time to time. When it happened we almost always had a huge fight, following a fed days of very bad mood, shame and guilt on my side. Sometimes it felt like it would be better if I just died. Whenever I told her I wish we could see eachother more, she promised that will happen but never did. She kept hiding me in front of her friends and family through the whole 4 years. Last summer she lied to me about being sick, and later I accidentaly saw pictures of her on some party the night when she turned me down for a date telling me she is sick. Again huge fight, and I started to doubt if she is faithful since she was constantly on facebook and other social media etc from that time on. In january we had another huge fight. I haven't seen her for months. I couldn't get out of the house because I was recovering from some operation because of some injury and she didn't come to see me once. Than I told her what is happening to me. Simotoms are like of an anxiety or panic attack. A month later she broke up with me, wanted to stay friends and ghosted me after 2 weeks. We had some contact again after 3 weeks but got in a fight again and now she is ignoring me. Well i stopped trying anyways.
I don't sleep too well. When attacks happen, I have trouble breathing, my heart is pounding, my chest hurts and there is a mixture of strong emotions inside me. I have to pretend every day that I'm quite OK and when I'm alone everything just comes crumbling down. I have trouble studying and trouble concentrating. Everything reminds me of her and I have distanced from my friends in those 4 years. She lives so close to me that everything reminds me of her. I have a part time job and am finishing uni but I'm not happy with that. No friend can replace talking to her and Every day seems harder.
Sometimes I just wish I was never born. I got so attached to her. I have put every single of my needs on hold so I could make her happy. I thaught making her happy would make me happy. In the end, she doesn't care and I'm dying on inside. We even never had sex in all this time. She really threated me like shit and I know that if she came back I would accept her eventhough I would feel like crap again. At least I had something to try and live for. At least she made me feel alive. 

I'm afraid that I'm sick in my mind and that I destroyed everything. I feel worthless and am afraid to seek help because in my country this stuff is taboo and I will be marked forever if anyone finds out.",12Jun2017,1

EDIT TITLE: Post diagnosis


Ive decided to post this because many of you may have been used by a Narcissist. Maybe you wonder what it is like to be the mind of one or why they are acting so. I may perhaps not be able to answer them all, but I certainly can tell you my side and I can take questions if you need.


I am completely starting over with a new therapist (I used to go to another therapist a few years earlier for PTSD and that's how I was diagnosed in the first place). Therefore we had to go over a lot of past details because she was still getting to know me.


I did not disclose to her my diagnosis in order to not be biased.


It was a rather long session, with us just getting to know things superficially. She remarked that I am self aware and this could greatly help in modifying my behavior. The PTSD still exists and is worse now so we will be focusing on this too. 


Your Narc may not even be aware of their condition and their behaviour because of it. The first step, as per my counsellor was to accept that you have a problem and work towards it and be aware of your behavioral pattern. But this isn't easy for us and please DO NOT SUGGEST YOUR N that they have a problem, you effectively kill all the chances of that person getting help.

What prompted me? Basically my need for attention is sky rocketing now. Feeling dependent on others was making me feel extremely vulnerable (which I hate). Of course I have a number of people who give me attention, but do I really need to always be thinking about it? 

When your N gets an enlightening moment, they may seek help too.",12Jun2017,6

So, I noticed it first time 3 weeks ago. It's not even about maintaining eye contact, it's inability to look at faces. When I see any stranger, be it just a person passing by me, cashier or a hairdresser, I immediately look somewhere away. When I force myself to look at someone, my face becomes numb and I stop blinking for some reason (lol). It feels super weird and uncomfortable. And sometimes I even cannot look at myself in the mirror; I mean, yes, I can look, but I can't see, my face becomes kinda blurry. I can't even apply makeup. Couple of days ago I stumbled upon my father in the street and didn't recognize him for like 40 seconds. I do not have social anxiety and I'm very outgoing and friendly.

46,"yesterday an evaluator came to my house because i needed to get into therapy before my appointments with my OBGYN (I just had my daughter one month ago) to get an antidepressant until I can get antipsychotics. now i explained to the nice lady that I resonate with a lot of content on the BPD subreddit, and that I'm not self-diagnosing, but I feel like an assessment regarding it should be considered. My boyfriend is Bipolar II, and he was present during the evaluation to help me be as thorough as possible because he witnesses all my crazy. He has suspected I am also bipolar, and he doesn't want to try and diagnose me either but someone with a mental disorder/illness will see someone behaving like said disorder/illness before others will. The lady also said that she can't diagnose me, but she is leaning towards me being bipolar. 

I want to look into subreddits and communities for self-help and venting and support. But she told me to try to stay away from all of it because I could try and mess up a diagnosis. Now, I know I am not, and it's comforting to know others are dealing with the same issues and to talk to others about them. I have already made progress before seeking treatment by using these subreddits, plus I'm turning 18 in two months and am worried about aging out of somewhere and switching services which i don't want to delay my treatment. 

I just am not sure wether or not to wait until treatment and services begin to stay off subreddits. I feel like they are the only place I can be myself and actually talk honestly about my feelings, besides therapists which i can talk to honestly. Should I use the subreddits as a means of support until treatment, or stop altogether?",12Jun2017,1
47,"This is partially to vent, but any advice would be great. 

I have had a very rough week, emotionally. My therapist, who I've been seeing for about a month and a half, has been suggesting antidepressants since the first session. It took me awhile to accept the idea of trying them. Last Thursday I went to see my doctor. I'd seen her a few times in the past, and just switched to her as my primary doctor because she seems to think of mental health as part of the process and is willing to work with me around my issues. I told her about my therapy and my therapist's suggestion that I try antidepressants. She said that she's willing to prescribe them, but she suggested that I try a therapist who does EMDR first. I’m going back in a week and a half to discuss how it’s going.

So, I have an appointment with my current therapist tomorrow and with the one suggested by my doctor next Monday. I'm nervous about trying EMDR. I've googled it, but it sounds complicated and I'm having trouble focusing long enough to get through the detailed descriptions. The little that I understand makes it sound, I don't know, fake? I'm not trying to talk down on it, I'm just having trouble seeing any hope in it. In addition, it sounds like you don't really talk about much. Is that true? I'm wondering if I need another therapist to deal with the EMDR therapy? I guess that might depend on the EMDR therapist, right? The uncertainty is making me anxious, and this therapy is a bit more expensive than I'd like. Still, I'm willing to try different things, and I'm trying to go into it with an open mind. 

In addition to that, I’m nervous about going to therapy tomorrow. I’ve been debating changing therapists for a little while now, so maybe I should just use this EMDR therapist as a changing point. That way I could go back to my current therapist if I was wrong about him not being the right therapist for me. I don't really know if I'm not doing therapy right or if he's not a good match for me.

It has just been a painful week, and it’s made worse because I won’t be going to a therapist that I intend to continue with for another week. This week has been an absurd mix of numbness/emptiness, lethargy, hopelessness and depression. I know that it’ll get better eventually, but it’s starting to feel like it won’t, with my current therapy making things worse and a new therapy that I don’t understand.

Anyway, thanks for listening.",12Jun2017,3

Sometimes, though, I notice she seems...different. I'm just wondering if it's possible as a layperson to really know if someone is experiencing (mild?) psychosis.",12Jun2017,1

61,"I sometimes think that my care should involve both the psychiatric and the pastoral in one person. The two are at odds when divided.

On the one hand, a pastor friend of mine is a psychiatric skeptic. He romanticizes the religious dimension of my mania but shows surprise and dismay when I tell him about chronic suicidality. He hasn't heard the half of it. What, for instance, would he make of my severe self-harm, which is bound up with religion? I hesitate to tell him. He is also naive to [scrupulosity](https://ocdla.com/scrupulosity-ocd-religion-faith-belief-2107), which is a debilitating obsessional twist on religious and moral observance. Spirituality plays a role in illness, yes, but for better *and* for worse. Teasing out the two requires skill in both domains.

On the other hand, my psychiatrists seem to be okay with my keen religious interest, and they sometimes even encourage it, but it is not something that they invest much time in. I had one Buddhist psychiatrist years ago who was the exception. I am not a Buddhist, but when I contacted him in mania he recommended medicine while also validating the spiritual aspects of the euphoria. To hear someone tell me that I could trust the feelings of peace and assurance that I was experiencing was more valuable to me than had he given me a million dollars. It was the pearl beyond price. His validation changed my spiritual life in substantial ways after the episode was over.

Has anyone else ever felt that their mental illness is legitimately bound up with spiritual well being? Have you ever spoken with a professional qualified in both psychiatric and pastoral care?",12Jun2017,1

63,"""Nothing I do has any bearing on the real world. I sit behind automaton flesh, I am regaled with sensations but they are all grey. I am unsure if I am hungry, but I eat to have eaten, speak to have spoken, and hear the chatter coming from other people, I cannot listen. They look like animals off in the distance, I am unconcerned. Each action I undertake proceeds to become diluted into chaos as soon as it materialises. There is no taste that is not predictable. 

When I try to get close to someone, their animal eyes absorb as much of me as a cat could (or an insect, for those of you who find that more helpful an example). They are purely physical, like a cat, where their desires and thoughts are mechanical, inherited from everything that comprised personal history. There is no point at which clockwork belays a soul, the clockwork is all. 

Existence is effort. As if the cascade into oblivion is half complete, I stop myself from slipping. I don’t necessarily care for this, I simply don’t know how to let go. I probably do not empathise at all with what I have written, I am divorced from this sentiment, but I can perceive the sensation of it.""

Anyone else feel like this?
Can it be fixed?
