0,"I've felt more and more strange in the past year or so. I've felt depressed before, nothing serious at the time but lately I feel like my mental health has just deteriorated to some degree. I've recently gotten a little better after months of depression and serious suicidal thoughts mostly due to my dad's and brother's depressive attitudes and drug abuse that almost got both of them killed, on top of my own feelings of inadequacy towards myself and just living my mundane life. Like I said, things got a little bit better lately but last night I had some episode that I've only had about 5 time in the past 3 years or so.

During these ""episodes"", I feel so odd, as if I'm outside of myself. I shake and feel scared. When I try to talk I just end up muttering, laughing, and babbling on without coherence. I know that I'm acting odd when this happens but I don't know how to stop. I have no thoughts in my head when this happens; I feel like I'm basically shutting myself off from my thoughts cause they'll be terrifying to me. Everything seems animated when this happens; I end up talking to anything I see as if it were alive- walls, showers, mirrors, etc. I also believe false ideas I hear even though I know they're bullshit- the 2nd to last time it happened I believed my dad was dead cause he went out for a few hours. It seems like a delusional episode to me but idrk. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. ",08Jan2017,2

2,"Hi guys, I posted this in /r/dreams then realised it's probably better suited here, so here goes.

I have no idea how to explain this or whether I'm posting in the right place, it has happened to me about 5 times over the past 3 years or so and I'm not finding anything explaining what is happening to me. 

Basically sometimes I'll have a dream about something, then I'll wake up and still believe completely what was true in the dream, for instance I've dreamt that crystals were growing around me and I could only break them by touching them, then when I wake up I still fully believe I have this ability for a short time and have to use it in some way to help somebody.

The feeling is always much stronger in relation to any sexual dreams I have, I most recently dreamt that I had a card game that when played could bring me to orgasm, I started imagining the cards in my head as though I was playing them over and over, eventually I woke up my parter consciously and started to explain it to her excitedly, at which point I realised it was nonsense. But as I said I believe this altered reality entirely and have trouble disassociating until I'm up and about for the day. 

Only the last time this happened (the card dream) I was aware I was being affected by the dream whilst awake, but consciously dismissed it somehow convincing myself this one for sure was real. Any previous time I haven't considered the reality might be false until way after its over.

These are only a couple of the dreams I've had or waking states I guess, but they're worrying me a lot as I don't want to end up believing something dangerous and hurting myself or my family unwillingly.",08Jan2017,5
3,"I don't know if what I'm dealing with could be considered depression, but I do feel like I might need to see a therapist. The main reason is I am dealing with a significant lack of motivation as well as a desire to be isolated. 

The motivation is an ongoing issue I have struggled with for years. In general it relates to exercise and housework. But over the last few months it seems to be extending more in to my job and other aspects of life. 

The desire to be isolated is more complicated. I have always been an introverted person, but over the last two years it has gotten to the point where I really don't want to deal with anyone when I'm away from work. Part of it stems from the end of my last relationship. I have more or less moved past that relationship, but have little desire to seek a new relationship because of a lifetime of bad relationships. 

The other thing is I purchased a house almost a year ago. For about a month after I was working on getting the house ready to move in. During that time I asked some of my friends for help with painting and other jobs, and no one was willing to help. I couldn't even get my friends to come by to see my new house. Just makes me feel like I'm better off letting people into my life. ",08Jan2017,2
4,"I bonded with someone about a year ago and started living with them. He and I shared an immensity of positive values and behaviors in common. He was more brother to me than any true family ever was.

But he was prone to fits of violence and to treating people with scorn. Eventually, he moved away, and I broke off contact because I couldn't handle my unpleasant feelings about him.

Now, for the past 6 months, I find myself possessed by more and more violent, hateful and blaming thoughts and actions akin to what I used to experience living with him and seeing the way he treated other people. I feel less and less love for others and myself and have lost my endurance to the unkind actions of others.

I feel like I am infected with parts of him that I took and emulated subconsciously. But how can I get rid of them? I hate being this way.",08Jan2017,3

16,"Growing up I always had anger issues. My mother tells me that thus started when I was just a toddler. As I got older I seemed to grow out of it. By the time I was 19 I had noticed significant improvement as had my parents. However, lately it would seem that I am regressing. I have once again found myself getting overly frustrated and angry at things that do not deserve such a dramatic response. I am even able to recognize at the time that it isn't reasonable but I can't seem to control my anger. I am much better at controlling my behavior than I was growing up but I am afraid I will go back to a point where I loose control of even that again. 
My parents didn't really believe in therapy so I never learned any good coping mechanisms. How do I calm myself down? What could be causing this? I have been under a lot of stress lately, could that be it? I also noticed that I went on my medication right around when I started getting better and it has been getting progressively worse since I stopped taking them. But I have also been getting more and note stressed. The medication was antipsychotics and antidepressants. Could that have effected it? Any help or advice is appreciated. Thank you all.

19,"I have been managing mental illness for most of my life through drugs and treatment, although not consistently. One of the most disturbing aspects of my illness is that I (f) go thru infrequent periods of paranoid delusion, usually brought on by the stress of dealing with a difficult person. If I feel threatened by a person's behaviour, I will fixate on the idea that I am being manipulated and stalked by them.

These fears are usually triggered by what I perceive as mildly manipulative, abusive or harassing behaviour from a male who I feel an attraction to. I have unpacked this with therapists and I have been told that I am drawn to these men as a result of being raised by an abusive, narcissistic and distant father.

At the moment my anxieties around a certain person have escalated to the belief that they are doing the following in a effort undermine my sanity:

Hacked my phone including the camera to spy on me.
Hacked my email account and have read my personal emails to find out what I am thinking about them, even though I track the IP access to my account and have found no evidence.
Hacked my laptop for access to all of my documents and photos (I covered the camera with Blutac).
Watching my internet browsing.
Tracked my Reddit activity and are alerted to everything that I post, even though I have changed accounts several times within the last month. Either that or they manage to randomly find my posts and figure out that it is me.
They are always driving by when I am on the street.
They have hacked my Facebook account, even though I periodically check IP access. 
Secretly photographed me and posted details about me online to mock me and plan how to mess with my head.

Even though I have discussed this with several people, including medical and mental health professionals, nothing can convince me right now that this is not real.

I imagine that they use all of this knowledge to subtly manipulate my feelings when they are around me. Even their choice of shirt will literally seem like a form of mockery. I read malevolence into everything they do and say around me. If they appear to be sending a text message I imagine that they have photographed me. I have no trouble rationalising all of this, even though other people make perfect sense when they tell me it is actually paranoia. I can see their point but to me it is very real. In fact I have little doubt that they will read this post.

I am about to commence therapy with a new psychologist and I am not sure what kind of treatment will work for me. My GP has suggested anti-psychotics and even though they have helped stabilised me in the past I am reluctant to take them again due to long term health concerns. I have been on the lowest dose of Fluoxetine for a long time.

I need therapies or tools to enable me to shut this down.

tl;dr I am overcome with paranoid delusions and I need the right kind of treatment.

20,"Recently I've been making a really strong effort to do mentally and physically positive things for myself such as walking, HIIT training, yoga, meditation and a good balanced diet (most of them daily) but the 'high' wears off after about an hour and I start to feel like nothing again. This wasn't a New Years resolution, this was more of an 'I need to do this fucking now' moment I had late last year. I've stuck to it, I do it, and on paper it looks amazing, but I don't feel it. Yes I feel good after some yoga followed by meditation, after a long walk or from knowing my calorie intake was lesser than my calories burnt but it just wears off after about an hour and I'm less sitting there feeling like it's not going to get any better than these short bursts.

I've got a story to tell and I think it might be beneficial for some people to hear. Or maybe not. Either way I think it's pretty alright. I had a fairly rough childhood, which I shan't go into here, and I've been fairly depressed for a while, 4 or 5 years (I'm 20.) it went undiagnosed for 4 of those years, and I only started seeking treatment in the past year. Having been getting help for a year now, I can honestly say I've improved so much. I still get sad, I still have my other mental health disorders (OCD AND GAD) but I cope, and I never get so anxious to the point of suicidal tendencies anymore. I started taking some medications, and now I'm sleeping better, eating better and feeling better. So I just want you to know, that it will get better. Not exponentially, but incrementally.

I've been seeing her a while and she stated that I have GAD, but I've not been 100% honest with her at all during our sessions - from downplaying thoughts/feelings to outright lying to her. I wrote a 3 page.. confession(?) yesterday and it explains things a little more in depth. I admit that I am actively self-harming, that I am suicidal, that I am extremely self-destructive, that I have this voice in my head constantly berating me non-fucking-stop, etc. I want to read it out to her, but I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to step away from my mask. I don't know how to admit what's really happening instead of downplaying or lying. I don't know how to just push through that urge to hide everything from everyone all the fucking time.

I'm tempted to take a shot or two of alcohol before the session begins. Would that be a dumb idea? I just don't know what else to do but if I don't start being honest with her than I'll never get better and I'll just continue to worsen.

26,"(Sorry its long) I'm not sure if this is the place to ask about this but I didn't know where else to go. My roommates struggles with anxiety and depression, and has been diagnosed with ADHD but doesn't believe she has it, although she uses the adderall she was prescribed for schoolwork. She also has medications she was prescribed for the anxiety and depression.

She had severe anxiety attacks about four times a week, usually late at night. At first I'd lay with her and hold her every night to help her through them but I can't stay up until 2am every night. The lack of sleep has started to affect my schoolwork. If I go to sleep before the attack she might call me or even wake me up by climbing into my bunk. 

She repeatedly says things like ""idk what I would do without you"". I feel awful because she really has become one of my best friends. Over Christmas break I thought it might be nice to get away and get some sleep but she calls me in the middle of the night and when I seldom pick up she guilts me into staying on the phone for hours. She will also send multiple texts in a row saying things like ""i need you"" and ""I know you're up"". I use her Netflix sometimes because we follow the same show and she'll stalk how much I get on, even if I open my computer she knows I'm online, and texts me about it. If I don't text back instantly she gets mad and will text again, and will say ""come on you know I'm needy."" She thinks I hate her because she has dreams where I tell her I hate her. I'm starting to actually hate her. My life revolves around avoiding her, and I feel like a terrible person for that. 

I've tried to tell her to get help at the free counselors office at school, but she says nothing will help her get better but me. She even said if we aren't roommates next year she doesn't know if she can keep going to school away from home, and that when I'm older she wants me to live in the same neighborhood as her and be best friends forever because she needs me.

I'm sorry this is so long but idk how to get through this next semester. My bf has anxiety and depression and doesn't need me like she does. I'm very supportive of him and would do anything to help him, so it's not like I want to stop supporting her, it's just extreme. What should I do to not hurt her while also not being the only one keeping her together? 

PS she is not gay and she respects my bf, although she does not like it when we FaceTime for too long (it's long distance) and will come and get me if she's going to have an attack while I'm FaceTiming him.

29,"I was with my partner for 10+ years. We done everything together. We explored the world. We grew up. We shared everything. We got married. We bought our first house.

It wasn't perfect. Far from it. To be honest we weren't that good a match and we had different approaches to almost every situation. We had furious arguments. We nearly broke up plenty of times. 

We broke up last year. I was hurt but I moved on eventually. After a couple months.

When I try to think about our time together, it seems like a distant memory. I can barely remember specifics. 
I can't even remember the date of our marriage. 
I can't remember if I was happy or sad.
I feel like I've built a wall around that entire portion of my life. Buried it.

Or maybe I just wasn't happy and I've moved on?

I don't know. I'm questioning everything. I'm depressed. I'm so so confused.

Have I blocked it all out?
Or have I just moved on because I wasn't happy?

I'm not exactly sure what causes my anxiety and depression, but I've narrowed it down to what I think it is; I have a fear of living longer than I have to. It's difficult to explain, but I feel like I've already lived an extremely long life and I'm only 21. I don't want to kill myself but I do want to die. I've tried numerous treatments and medications but none have really worked. I've never done drugs(no weed), I drink often but only rarely to excess, never alone.

I constantly am thinking about suicide, it's probably 80% of my waking thoughts, but I have control of my faculties enough to know that I won't do it, and I'm not worried about myself doing it in a panic.

He had a professional looking questionnaire and I decided to try it. At the end of the questionnaire it required my email to see the results, but that's the usual business way.

I read the results and they looked okay, although a bit generic. Says I have severe anxiety, that's not news to me. At the second page he sells his method for treatment. Okay, I check it out.

There is a promise that I can reduce my anxiety from level 65 out of hundred to 27 in two weeks, a button for a free trial and a video. I uploaded the video onto web. [Link] (http://sendvid.com/jr3awl6v) (Sorry for the crappy website I just used whatever came up on google)

Watching the video I start seeing the bullshit that this guy is trying to sell.

He says in the video that medication and therapy (CBT in particular) are not effective and even ""deadly"". That's his term. He then tries to prove his point by some weird logic, unverified claims and his own wrong assumptions. He even quotes the US National Department for Health and Human Services which according to him reported that ""CBT results are discouraging and even leading therapists question their discipline"". I googled for such review document and could not find it. Conversely, I found many articles and reports confirming the efficiency of CBT. Throughout the 20 minute video he never even hints at his method. His ""free"" trial actually required a deposit of $68 on some website which according to him you may refund in 7 days.

I became frustrated with this shit. He is making people believe false claims. Discouraging people from seeing professionals. How can that be legal? Is there way to report such jerks?

33,"I'm 28, and I have struggled with three mental illnesses since high school. I always coped pretty well until a job I had that was full of very toxic people. I quit that job, even though my therapist advised me not to. I did not see any function in allowing those people to treat me the way they were treating me (it wasn't my first job). And after I quit that job (and fired the therapist) I started to get slightly better and changed my frame of mind. This is what I'm having trouble with. After the job I went on a quitting rampage. I'm gonna be specific as possible as to who and why. I had a really close friend and we had some minor trouble before, in friendships I don't see it out of the ordinary. But last time she disrespected my husband, entitled herself to some money we were gonna give her anyway as thanks for a favor, but she took it. I confronted her and she said that it wasn't her intention and that she was going to give us the money back, I respectfully told her to keep it, it was gonna be hers anyway, but the way she took it was bad taste. And we parted our ways. She tried to fix things but really I felt strongly like I should be away from her. The second one was my friends from high school. They where using our whatsapp group to say really mean stuff about people we went to school with, they would take pictures from other social media (I don't use social media except Tumblr and Reddit) and put them in the group and just burn them. One day they took a picture of the daughter of my friend. He's white and he's wife is black and the baby is a little caramel with very curly difficult hair. She was three years old and they just put the picture rip the kid and her mom to shreds, making fun of their hair, and I had enough and also confronted them. I told them that the behavior was bad for me and for them as well. That is was a little bizarre how much time they invested on the burning. And they responded me by basically saying that they get tired from work, and their lives (two of them are mothers) and that sometimes thats the only thing they have to laugh and pass the time, that they are not hurting anyone, I quit the group I have only talked to them if I stumble into them, I say hi how are you keep walking. And family members what don't acknowledge my illnesses so they don't follow the guidelines to not cause any triggers and help. One of them told me my suicidal thoughts (from long time ago before my treatments) that was me being angry and calling for attention. I'm still depressed, but unlike before I have picked up exercise and I'm sticking to it longer than I have before and also I have sticked to my diet for almost a year. I learned how to draw and there are a lot of things I got time to learn now. But this entire situation is confusing to me. It's new to me. And I did it because I felt stuck with those people.

I don't self-medicate. Totally drug-free. Very little alcohol. I just want to get better.

I don't have a regular doctor. I just go to urgent care when I need something. How do I find a doctor? Do I even go to an MD? Or do I go to a psychologist/therapist? Where do I find these people? Like, I know where the hospital is, but I don't know how to set this shit up.

I'm an emotional and psychological mess. I can't take care of myself. I just sit at home and ignore my needs. How the fuck do I begin?

What does help even look like? Am I going to get pumped full of drugs? Will I be myself after? Will I want to be myself after? Or will I just talk on a couch for three hours a week? Is that going to make me think about suicide less and focus on grading essays more?

I'm 23 (M), have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and have been on antidepressants since Spring of 08 (partially due to incredibly low heart function).  For the last two years, I have been dealing with significant anxiety and depression mainly due to back pain.  Last year, I was prescribed Fetzima, which kind of helped for a couple months and then stopped working.  I tried a bazillion different things alongside the Fetzima to see if I could get it to work for me again, but after nine or ten months, I changed to Lexapro.  A couple weeks later, I went to a new psychiatrist, who switched me over to Prozac.  Rather than tapering the Lexapro, I simply stopped taking it and switched to Prozac (I guess they're similar enough that you can do that).  For a couple weeks, I felt the best that I had felt in the last two years.  However, after these few weeks, I began to feel incredible fatigue mid-day.  At around two o'clock, I would often become so tired that I would doze off for a few hours (I usually never take naps).  As a result of this, I couldn't sleep at night, which became a nasty cycle that allowed my depression to get worse.  I went through a period of about a week where I took Nyquil every night just so I could sleep.  At one point I thought it might be Serotonin Syndrome, but I don't think I have the right symptoms, and the fatigue and insomnia happened before I started taking Nyquil.  In addition, I began to have disturbing intrusive thoughts.  I have a chair lift in my house, and whenever I ride in it, I get thoughts about falling out of the lift and dying a painful death.  Anyway, I switched back to Lexapro close to two weeks ago, and my depression has worsened.  I think I'm still having the insomnia, my anxiety has worsened, I still have the intrusive thoughts.  The fatigue may have gotten better, but it's hard to tell when I don't have any motivation to do anything.  I won't be able to get into a new psychiatrist in a while (my current one doesn't seem to know what she's doing, and seems to think all her patients have ADHD), so I'm looking for any advice or ideas I  can get.

Everytime this split second phenomenon happens it feels like a pang of unfamiliarity and intense fear. But yet sometimes my surroundings can feel normal, and sometimes hyper-real. It's not a constant thing, more of an unexpected, sudden burst that I try to control to the best of my will power but seems to take its course anyway. I talked to a psychologist who told me i have panic disorder. But I'm afraid it could be something more serious than a panic attack. I have yet to see a primary care doctor and am going to do so soon. When this happens I also have a hard time communicating with people around me. I feel embarrassed to talk about it yes, but I feel like I can't find the words to express what's wrong. I feel uncoordinated and pressured. Like the world is slowly slipping away. I also have episodes of not believing that anything is real. I've literally thought I was in a coma, in a very deep long sleep having a dream that I'm never going to wake up from. Again this happens suddenly, while taking a walk or sitting on the porch or even in the kitchen. When it starts to fade, I feel the world make sense again and the wierd thoughts leave my head. This happens in varied intensities, durations, and sometimes has variable symptoms like shaking or crying depending on how severe it is.",09Jan2017,2

43,"hi, i've never told anyone about this but i feel as if i don't get this out, the tightness in my throat will get worse.
i'm a teenager, and you may say that teenagers do stupid things like this but i feel as if the cause of my lying is much deeper than it should be.
i pretend that i'm a relationship. please do not brush this off and say that it's a phase. i lie a lot, and it's something that i cannot handle. dont get me wrong, i am honest most of the time but the times i DO lie, it sticks with me for a long time.
i feel as i need a relationship to validate myself, help?",09Jan2017,5
44,"So I am 17 and have been on lithium for bipolar for about three years.

I ran out two days ago, taking a little under two 300 mg tablets instead of 3 1/2. Then, my family went to see a movie that ran later than usual due to technical troubles. When we got out, my parents the pharmacy was closed, and it was.

In addition, two days ago I tried a stimulant for the first time for my ADD, which can cause mania, which we did not see, but I felt buzzy and confused after it wore off.

Confusion didn't go away, I feel lightheaded and very irritable, but have controlled myself... No one noticed a change in me, but I feel it. My counselor said I might be giving myself a placebo effect.

 I'm taking the meds tonight, will I be okay tomorrow?",09Jan2017,2
45,"Hope this is ok to post. I'm not diagnosed with anything.

I just feel like I don't know how I feel, like if someone was to ask me I'd say alright but I don't know. I don't think I really feel anything at the moment, I almost feel like there's something that I can't quite put my finger on.

I am lonely, but that's embarrassing to admit, and I seem to have highs and lows in my mood, so as a result have started tracking it. So I wonder if I'm actually feeling normal and just overthinking it?

Any advice welcome, thank you",09Jan2017,5
