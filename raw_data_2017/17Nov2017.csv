3,"Hi,
My name is Jody Quine and I am a singer/songwriter based in Vancouver Canada.
My music is often compared to Sarah McLachlan, and Aimee Mann, and I’ve written a song that helped me through a very dark time a few years ago, and I thought perhaps it would be something I could share here for those struggling with depression, who could use a little supportive music to help them get through. 

Go On
https://youtu.be/hB2Gn_0Gs40


In the fall of 2014 I went through a depression. At the darkest silence, heavy and feeling so alone, I sat at the piano, and this song came through me. 

Having faced some other dark times and also being somebody who meditates, I knew that in this space, I could also make choices about who I wanted to be as I healed. I decided I wouldn’t fake anything and be open to what brought me any sense of joy. I knew 1 thing, and that was I needed be able to make music, and that everything else was empty. 

The first thing that brought me a sense of any smile was my daughter running towards me when I was picking her up at school 3 days later. That’s the moment I decided that if a choice or opportunity wasn’t about those 2 things, music, and my children, therefore my family, it wasn’t worth my energy or my worry. I lived that way for over a year and rebuilt my strength and spirit from there.  Now whenever things get heavy or hard, I remember to slow down and listen to my internal guidance system, my spirit, and ask myself; is this about my family or music? and if not, then I let it go.

Every step in our lives, every struggle, is an opportunity to love ourselves a little more and listen to what it is that might truly bring us enough joy to Go On. 


I hope you like it, and thank you for your time,
jody

4,"Got through school somehow though. I can write, but I can't read. I can't sit still. It's always been this way.  I was just trying to read a book a second ago. It's not complicated, basic english, not conceptually heavy, but I can't sit still and read it.  Someone suggested I try adderall.  I remember when I was in grade 8, they gave us all this test to see where we stood relative to the rest of the province. The test was broken up into different categories, and somehow they ranked us by grade level.  My problem solving at the time (and I don't want to brag) was ranked grade 11. My reading level was ranked grade 3. I'm absolutely serious. It was ranked grade 3.  Thankfully, that test had no effect on my graduating from grade 8.  The only reason I got through my english classes in high school was because the essays we had to write were always on theme, not plot. So I could try to read the book, doze off, and stop paying attention, and kind of get the plot, but do fine in the essay.  I'm not sure what to do. There are so many books I want to read.  I can't get adderall and I doubt my doctor will give it to me since I'm already on antipsychotics.",17Nov2017,5

8,"Ever since I was in my early teens I've experienced depression and anxiety as a result of being bullied over the years in school. But it always seemed to be more in the background only really getting worse and more in the forefront since early adulthood (22) when my parents just split up out of the blue. Since then it has been VERY difficult to deal with. I am going back to therapy again because I don't want to feel this way.

But another issue I've had since my early teens has been sudden but short outbursts of rage resulting in breaking things, yelling/screaming, and I hate to say it but sometimes subtle instances of pet abuse (seriously if you want to let me have it for that I understand, it sickens me that it would happen and I hate myself every day remembering those times, but I've never caused any serious harm and I know that doesn't excuse it but it was difficult to defuse)

After each of these outbursts of anger, for a moment I seethe but immediately feel extreme guilt and remorse. Like if I had got frustrated at my cat for instance and screamed at it/chase it off, I would stand there still angry but then the remorse hits and I'd go find them and hug them, shower them with kisses and profuse apologies and sometimes cry at what I had done.

Just about anything is a trigger and the script is always the same. It can be a person, an animal annoying me, or frustration at inanimate objects. The best way I can explain the feeling is: you know those test your strength games with the bell and mallet at carnivals/fairs? Well basically one second I'm really calm or slightly irritated but then in an instant it feels like someone swung that mallet so hard and fast that the bell shoots up and is rung instantly. It's almost like I can feel it in my head. My eyes get wide and I get this feeling in my head with a slight shake and then explode.

I've never done anything to physically harm another person and I don't want to, and I don't keep any animals anymore because I don't trust myself. But I know I want to find a way to stop it and I think that IED is what I feel accurately describes this issue.

But I would like opinions from those who have/have dealt with this before, either firsthand or from the sidelines if you think that it could be a feasible explanation? I plan to bring it up to my therapist anyway but insight from others never hurts as well.

9,"My divorced Mom hasn't held a job for over a decade and has been borrowing money from her retired parents for years to pay the mortgage. Despite increasingly urgent pushing from a lot of her family (siblings and parents) it seems like she is just sitting alone at home doing nothing.

The family is seriously discussing cutting ties now, and I'm worried that she'll end up homeless.

After I've finally guilted myself into getting up to take care of my dog and interact with my family to seem a bit normal. Next I take my meds.. that's where it starts... an hour or so passes i don't move off the couch. If I do its to go back to the bedroom to be alone and collect myself. (Pretty much tell myself I'm dumb what am I doing) 

Then the prozac kicks in and my legs are tingling and I can't stop moving them but I'm mad and happy and energized! 

With nothing to do, no hope to get a job go to school the store or even make myself eat. I eat 1x a day and that's if my boyfriend notices I haven't eaten all day, I wait and think what can I do to make up for this shit mess I call me. If something happens to set me off emotionally I lose all of it. Crying uncontrollably shaking thinking of hurting myself just to make my mind shut the fuck up and realize my life's not horrible.  It's not great but there's worse off people and I am thankful for my life but I don't deserve it. Then I breakdown and tell my boyfriend what I'm thinking.. that I should triple my dose or quad . Or just take it all will that make me better .. normal.. then the threats start ""i'm calling an ambulance ur going to the hospital"" this just makes me livid.  And feelings of betrayal loneliness and sadness get worse I feel like they want to get rid of me. Well hell I'd get rid of me too.. but I'd also be a good friend to myself. If I wasn't me. I'd notice how much pain I'm in and be helpful.  But I don't have any friends.. I don't leave my house.

11,"My self esteem is trash.  It’s not uncommon for me to cringe or be upset with myself after a lot of social interaction.  I constantly beat myself up and anytime someone says they like me I immediately think *why would* ***they*** *like me?*  

I’ve been fighting a lot of these thoughts off since getting new friends and hanging out with them.  I made a lot of progress.  While I was and am still struggling with other aspects, I started to feel ok with myself when others are involved.  It wasn’t perfect, but I felt maybe I could get better.

I still have friends, but half of them treated me like crap recently (basically punished me for not getting somewhere on time, I had work and underestimated walking/commute time and such).  So I’m back at square one.

I realized I put all of my recovery into other people.  I logically know I’m not some horrible creature who should die alone, but now I need to figure out how to convince the irrational and emotional side of my brain and I have no clue how to do it.  Sure, I have people around me who love me and enjoy my company, but what happened was proof enough for that part of my brain that I’m terrible.  I don’t know how to switch gears from “I’m an ok human because these people like me,” to, “I’m a decent person because I try to do decent things,” or just love and accept myself.

If I keep putting my recovery and mental health on other people it’s just going to get slashed.  I just don’t know how to do that.

I’m waiting to see a psychiatrist because I have other problems too (7 years of problems), but I worry it won’t fix everything, and this seems like what I have the most control over.

18," After 5 years of therapy with 6 different therapists and different types of therapy I can honestly say that I haven't gotten any better from therapy. It doesn't do anything.  When I hear ""psychodynamic therapy"" I hear ""bullshit"". Therapists really have no idea what the fuck is going on ""unconsciously"" or in some cases even how to deal with their problems (i met with a therapist who was incredibly insecure about her weight and believed she was fat when she clearly wasn't. She was teaching me CBT Techniques for changing beliefs). You can even see that all of the major psychoanalysts had COMPLETELY different views on things that are not even close to each other. I could rant forever on how Freud while very intelligent didn't care for his patients and tried to manipulate them into giving him money and only used them for income/studying the human mind. Many psychologists lie about case studies to make it seem like their method works. It's just such a big scam. Imagine going to school for over 6 years to become a mental health worker studying the same shit over and over. OF COURSE YOURE GOING TO BELIEVE IT WORKS. It's fucking brainwashing. Not to mention they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of their life on school so they're not just going to admit it's bullshit and go back to school. I've yet to meet anybody change dramatically or significantly from therapy alone. People think that when they take meds and go to therapy that they're putting in he hours and making progress but it's just the ssri numbing your issues. And don't even get me started in ssris, I'm not just saying this because I'm angry but that shit is poison. Look up the documentary ""Numb"" people who take the stuff after a while can't cry anymore, I know I had that issue. It feels like they made me dumber and left me in a mental fog. I haven't taken them for 15 months after having took them for 2 years. It makes your dick numb and everything is less sharp. I can't cry as much anymore and I don't get too happy or too sad. It feels like there is always this tension that I'm trying to release but I can't. No wonder Prozac is banned for people under 18 in the U.K.  The drug companies tested it for SIX WEEKS on rats before they decided it was safe for people to take. Unless you have extremely severe depression/schizoaffective/ bipolar disorder and can't find a way to manage those things with diet (keto, intermittent fasting, read brain brain and ultra mind solution) exercise, sports, creative outlets that help you get into a flow state, and supplements then you really probably shouldn't take it. Get some fish oil pills, take vitamin d3, go for a run every day, get some sun and talk to people.  Its like it's become fashionable to see a therapist and to say that it helps a ton so that maybe whoever you tell that to goes to therapy and you can feel like less of a loser. nobody wants to admit that they didn't get better in therapy because if you see a therapist you'd better not be the neurotic one who goes for 20 years and doesn't get any better. I guess CBT/DBT/ACT are okay because they give you something practical to do but you don't need a therapist for that, atleast not for more than a couple of weeks. Get a workbook and do the exercises and maybe you'll get a little bit better. But I don't see anybody curing a specific anxiety or insecurity overcoming that and having it no longer be an anxiety or insecurity.  psychodynamic therapists don't spend nearly enough time with the patient to make any headway on ""unconscious issues"" and I don't know if psychoanalysis does anything because yet again every time I try and search for a success story there aren't any. Do we have anybody who has gotten better, I am lost rn and don't know if I should keep wasting $200 a week on this shit that doesn't work.

19,"A little context here.

I have what would be termed ""orthorexia"". It's where you are compulsive about clean and ""pure"" foods, but not only that, to such an extent where it starts compromising your social life, mental health, and physical health.

For the past 10 years since I was a teenager, most of my daily life has been consumed with food and how it affects my health. I'm vegan, but have been fruitarian for long periods of time. I'm gluten-free, sugar-free, oil-free, low-fat, sometimes grain-free/starch-free, dairy-free, and the list goes on and on.

This past week I've been sick with fatigue and its given me a LOT of time to think. I don't want to live this life anymore. I'm not even healthy. I'm the most frail person I know. I go on ""cleanses"" every few weeks. I can't concentrate or retain information like I used to. My motivation is shit.

I want to know if anybody has experience with having a similar lifestyle and choosing to ""loosen up""...I have pushed away many of my friends and missed out on family events because of my food issues. I've made so many conversations devolve into a food debate because I HAD to eat fucking zero-calorie noodles at thanksgiving.

Most of all, I want to feel pleasure from what I eat again. Meals are never fun and if I salt food even a little I'll feel bad about it...I'm thinking of occasionally incorporating animal products into my diet to start with. Also, I'm going to see a therapist soon.

22,"A quick summary up to this point -

I was born the third of four children. My older siblings came from a previous relationship of my mothers and my younger sibling came from a step-father. When i was 13 my mother was going through her third divorce and prior to its finalization had began seeing another man. My step-father murdered my mother and was hunted for three days before taking his own life. I moved back in with my father whom I only saw usually once a year from ages 8-13. He is extremely loving and supportive, although could never play a disciplinary role off what I assume was sympathy.

Needless to say, I spent my teenage years in a nasty depression. I attempted suicide multiple times and led a life style that seemed to be passive attempts of offing myself. My first suicide attempt was at age 12 even before my mom died, only thing that stopped it was the rail holding my belt snapped. I was prescribed numerous medications which made me feel like a zombie just going through the daily life activities. I had a close group of friends but wasn't exactly the most social. Ive always felt as if I've had zero charisma and all the relationships I built were a weird fluke. I began self-medicating and fell victim to addiction to anything I could get my hands on. From the age of 13 I began smoking pot, at 16 began club drugs and even huffing air duster to freon, and between 18-20 I tried everything other than injecting drugs. I still binge drink and would consider myself a functioning alcoholic. 

When I was 20 I found myself to be in an extremely toxic relationship with a girl who seemed to only want the best intentions. She was extremely emotionally abusive but did encourage me to get my shit together. However, druing an LSD trip I finally decided to not live my life doing nothing. I started college, stopped drugs, but was becoming suicidal again while in the relationship with my toxic ex. I left her after meeting my now wife and completing school.

Im currently employed as a medical professional, am living very comfortably for a 23 year old, and have married an amazing woman. Yet, I find myself constantly asking myself what has this all been for? I feel happy while I'm engaged in an activity, but feel worthless and as if everyone who cares for me is part of a grand joke that I haven't been included in. I lost all my friends when I quit doing drugs, I cant seem to find any way to develop friendships with other adults. The kicker is, Im not suicidal, but don't feel I provide any benefit to the people around me. If I began becoming a burden to my loved ones Im sure I could easily step back into that realm of suicidal ideation. I know adulthood isn't supposed to be great, though Ive done everything right, havent I? Why do I still feel hollow and without self worth? I would rather not try anti-depressants again, I actually like experiencing my emotions, the highs and lows.

TL;DR - Mom died by murder/suicide by my step dad at age 13. Somehow lived through multiple suicide attempts and 7 years of drug addiction. Busted my ass for two years at age 20 to get my life back on track but still feel hollow and worthless. Fuck anti-depressants.

Two months ago, at the behest of my wife, I went to see a psychiatrist who proceeded to explain that I have GAD, DD-NOS, C-PTSD, and (after extensive testing, because the DD/PTSD combo complicate things) ADHD. 
The first relief was validation that I'm not crazy. The second relief is that there are great medical resources for help. The third relief, though, is that there are almost 40,000 people right here that I can talk or listen to.
No longer is an urgent desire to kill myself a personal struggle. No longer does trembling enough to warrant a 5 on the richter scale just from introducing myself to another person make me a freak. No longer does talk of rape/sexual abuse/molestation make me feel guilty and ashamed, but passionately angered and outspoken. Best of all, no longer does stealing alone time by staying up well beyond everyone else make me feel lonely, but excited that I get to read and talk to people like me.
There are a lot of subreddits devoted to my diagnoses, but they all seem to be a conglomeration of people that want attention and have no interest in community. I really don't feel that here. 
This is quite literally my first post on Reddit (comments don't count), but I want you all to know I appreciate every last one of you and for the FIRST (can't be stressed enough, GAD sucks) time in my life am actually looking forward to interacting with a group of strangers (You).

25,"So I've moved back in with my mother because I was having a bad time dealing with my mental state and taking care of myself. Recently I've begun to remember why I moved out in the first place. I'm all alone here, I have nobody I feel like I can actually talk about what goes on my mind to. Lately I've been itching to get away from this place, it's depressing as hell. I don't want to see my mom and stepdad's marriage fall apart. And they're both too dense to take criticism (my mother especially). Nobody really understands me. 
I have issues with insecurity. My looks, behavior, everything. Exes have reassured me plenty of times, yet I have difficulty believing that they were actually attracted to me despite it being obvious. I mean my mother never paid me much attention and my most significant relationships ended with me being cheated on. 
My father left at a young age and he's had the full capacity to communicate with me, but hasn't made much of an effort. I don't see a reason to if he doesn't take an interest.
My siblings used to taunt me for acting weird when I was young. I'm honestly not so sure what I was doing in particular, but they liked to call me gay. Lo and behold, years later, I'm pretty sure I'm bi, but I'm not open about that at all.
They also slapped me around quite often and were never punished for it. I just kind of accepted what happened to me.
I take to authority quite well. Was in JROTC in high school and almost went into the Air Force, but then I had issues quitting smoking weed and my mental health background.
I feel like I've always had some trouble with really connecting with people. I mean aside from a few significant others. 
I'm sometimes scared I'm doomed to be alone. That no woman will be able to put up with my fucked mental health. I think about suicide more regularly now. Not as much in a severely depressed set of mind though. It's more casual now, if that makes sense. I tend to fantasize about death. 
Since I was young, I'd mostly seen men in a negative light. I'd grown accustomed to expecting the worst from men. I mean, my dad used to hit my mom and the boyfriends my sisters had were just as bad. I hated myself for being a guy. Some of that resentment may still remain. 
I'm pretty timid. People sometimes can't hear me because I'm speaking too quietly. I sometimes overhear comments ""what's up with that guy?"". Because of the scars on my arm? I don't know. 
I feel like a freak. Am I going crazy? Apparently I don't have problems socially, but I feel like I'm so out of the loop.
Sometimes I feel paranoid. Like for some reason, nobody likes me and everbody's just pretending to be nice for some reason. 
I mean shit, I've gotta be fucked up, right? I broke up with a girl like 2 years ago because I was shitfaced and I've been hung up on her since. Nothing like meaningless sex and relationships that I become uninterested in, right? And now I become the asshole because I don't know what I want and every girl I date wants big commitments up front.
Did I ever mention that I haven't had many friends since I graduated in 2015? And I'm totally underplaying that too. I come home and play multiplayer games by myself because I'm an antisocial fuck.

I’ve tried to push her to get professional help but she refuses and won’t change her mind. She is 17 and we are in the UK so getting help wouldn’t be hard.

35,"*I started out this post detailing one of her more violent episodes but, the violence is not that important. Yes, in ways it affected me, but the real abuse was not physical. This post is not as much talking about my mental health but rather giving background to where some of it came from. My story, from start to finish over several posts. Bearing all for all to see. Giving insight to my past, telling my story. A way of me confirming I am happy with this now, helping me recover who I am, highlighting how it impacted my mental state. I wrote out a 3-page post over and over and yet feel the point was missing. So, I am trying again with a new approach. I hope everyone enjoys reading my post (as morbid as that sounds) and please, any questions, maybe thoughts on the below or even want to discuss your current/previous situations in relation to emotional/physical abuse please do so. Never be ashamed/sacred to speak out. We are all unique and beautiful.* 


Mother was an angry, manipulative, aggressive, violent and exceptionally unhappy woman. Long term bi-polar disorder mixed with a childhood she never speaks of, but small hints of violent/unhappy childhood given away in small doses over the course of my life. She was her own worst enemy and from a young age somewhat of an idol to myself. She never dealt with her emotions which is also something she taught me. Unhappy/worried? Get angry and violent. Sad or excited? Eat. Ignore the current state and use something else. The list is endless but teaching me not to deal with my emotions was the first stage, installing what she believed to be correct way to thank and act. She began to enforce rewards systems to control me, at times, through eating/food or gifts/money. I can recall one situation where I was accused of taking her credit card (I was 6 years old and before we had computers), the one she left in store, so decided to ransack my bedroom, destroying most of the gifts I got the Christmas. This resulted in being given a crumpled, unapologetic five-pound note. No sorry, nothing said, just the silence and dark stair. 

From a young age I was subjected to social seclusion, I was not allowed to hang out with any of the local kids in my town. Apparently, they were all ‘bad’ children and believed I would be influenced by them resulting in becoming, well I am not to sure what she expected. The kids that I did hang about with ended up doing very well in life which is why I struggle to see her point of view. I was not allowed to out and play with the other local kids, I was to stay within the confines of my home creating both emotionally and physically unhealthy child (obese from a young age). I had to find happiness inside my own mind/imaginations. This resulted in being a very socially unaware child, not knowing how to deal with conversations, behaviours or social norms. All behaviours were learned from mother, which looking back was destined to be my ruin. By the time I had got to High School it became very apparent. Overwhelmed by different personalities, fear kicked in, so I did what I knew best. Anger and violence. I put up walls to everyone around me, being rejected to groups is not something I experienced. I was vulnerable, completely disconnected and alone. The irony was that in the run up to attending high school mother repeatedly told me “you are going to get bullied to fuck, kids like you always get bullied. You will never make friends”. She installed failure from the start. Her “assumptions” came to life, I did end up being bullied. So badly in fact even to this day thinking about how alone I was still brings a tear to my eye. So alone in the world, so lost without a single friend. I will talk about how that impacted me later in another post. 

I love my dad. Truly one of the strongest men I have ever met, who I hold in high regards, admire greatly and a man I aspire to be. I paint the picture of perfection, but I never always viewed or treated him in this way. My dad made many decisions, which in hindsight were the right decisions but they were the unpopular. This played into mother’s hands, allowed her to bounce me off dad and into her arms, in a sense. Using her manipulative behaviours, she would play the popular vote which was the one any kid would favour. Do homework? you don’t need to. Go for a walk? No, pointless. These sounds petty but I am trying ton condense and give you an idea. She wanted to be the favourite, part of something, use it (which she did) as a weapon against my dad. Threaten to leave know the kids would follow, highlight he would have no life without her and telling me my dad never cared about me, only money (although it worked I now am not sure what she meant by money). It was morbid and cruel. Cold hearted and disgusting, everything she is and consumed by her vulnerability. Her tactics worked, I ended up, for a period, hating my dad. Never wanted to be around him. I remember when he told me he had cancer (I was 8, I think) I acted in such disgusting manner. Told him he was a freak and to never come near me, “I hate you anyway” I screamed. I never did, I loved him but years of misguiding my thoughts and feelings led me to believe this was true. This was not the worst, the beating was. I remember he disagreed with me about something, I became engulfed by anger and beat him. Badly. Threw him to the ground and never stopped. Several broken bones, he lied to the doctor, he fell apparently. I regret nothing in life, never want to change anything but this I do. I would change this, even if it changed me slightly, I never have forgiven myself. I’m sorry dad. Words I have yet to say to him, I will one day I just hope he knows this.

I do not shy from admitting I have suffered from many health troubles, mother being a great influence negatively, both physical and mental, the latter being most prominent. By now you are getting an idea where from, but not just here I will add. My final memories in remembering some of the hate was from the last couple of years regarding my new career, psychiatric nursing. I remember when applying for the course she would mock me, publicly in front of friends and family how “people like you” could be a nurse, in that field. This was a constant, apparently, I was not good enough to be one, my flaws making me “useless” and nobody would “hire or work” with someone like me. Unfortunately for her, even though (I hate to admit) these words hurt, years of working on who I am, becoming self-aware, working on dealing with emotions and no longer living with her, allowed me to grow into the man I am today. Her attempts to break me down, play the sinner and saint failed. Trying to bully me, manipulate my dad’s advice of be who I want to be and get inside my head did not work. I am strong now, still to this day I work on my emotions, working on how I act in social situations. Working on who I am, along with help from councillors I have managed to overcome this situation with mother. I despise my mother for all the hate she installed, and I have no relationship with her anymore which has made me happier.  I have the best relationship with my dad and I am living life, with all my flaws in the open. I may be vulnerable, scared at times but that makes me who I am, and to me that is something beautiful.

So I started this to write about my mental health, I want to share, I don’t think some of it so far is not half bad! 

Some context: I’m a psych student. I have always liked literature though, it’s a hard time at the moment I have always had trouble expressing myself conventionally, abuse and trauma does tend to disconnect you from your emotional and bodily state! Want to try and become a Trauma therapist myself. But on the other hand I worry I might not recover enough to help others or I am awkward af!

37,"My back is complete broken now and I've had enough of life. I suffer from severe mental illness - bipolar disorder and hypomania. They coupled together supposedly make me highly intelligent per my psychiatrist and psychologist but they make life hell for me. I am miserable. Ever since my teens my life has been pathetic and I've been fighting my illness, it has been more than 10 years now. I have been fighting, coming out of it, only to fall back in. I've tried to tame this beast of a mind but failed time and again. This cyclical exercise has completely broken my back. I don't have anything left in me now. I'm a robot going through the motions - i don't cry, it has been months since I smiled or laughed. I have done several suicide attempts in past and have failed. I stopped suicide attempts a while back because I realized my parents are growing old and losing a son at this age will be heart breaking for them. Because of this fucking illness I could not sustain a nearly 4 year old relationship that I desperately wanted to and had to break up. The girl I was with was pretty apathetic to my illness but despite me giving my sincere efforts, I couldn't save the relationship. I don't wish mental illness to anyone, it kills you every day, till you are no longer a person with emotions at all. I've changed my therapists over last few years, my medication has been experimented upon but nothing has worked. I quit from a job I was supremely doing well a while back. I'm back broken now - I don't think I've in me to do a job at all now - waking up in morning, getting ready, eating breakfast, going to office, meeting people, shaking hands, having lunch, coming to home, having dinner. Guess I will live off my family for the rest of my life. Earlier I wished that if I ever come out of this misery I will donate and do a lot of work to help mental healthcare scenario in the world. But now I know I won't come out. I am waiting for the day when my mother and father die, after that I too will commit suicide in peace. If I die of natural causes before that it would be heaven for me. I know this post is not articulate and I guess I made it to just rant.",17Nov2017,3

43,"I am usually a very intense, anxious guy. I work very hard at school and am very conscientious and analytical. I feel like this causes me to be intense, always over-analyzing what I say, what others are saying, etc. This causes me to never feel as though I am in the moment, I am always thinking about things in the past or present. 

February of this year something started to change in me. For some reason, these images of specific objects started appearing in my head. They made me feel calm and relaxed. Things like a tribal pattern that you would see in a quilt, blankets for sofas, meditation cushions, mandalas hung against a window that lets in some light. For some reason. I found this very pleasing.

Slowly but surely, my entire psyche slowed down and I became attached to the present moment. My curiosity for trivial things stopped getting the best of me, I stopped analyzing things, I started taking people's intentions at face value and I really started to recognize the importance of silence and body language. 

To sum it all up, I was thinking way less and feeling way more. It was the happiest two months of my life. At the same time, my parents were fighting so much that I was 100% done with them and I let go any negativity they brought into my life. I felt alive again. I thoroughly enjoyed actives I found annoying like making myself tea, listening to calming music, and showering. They became things to take time in, rather than breeze through.

Around May, I experienced a very stressful and traumatic experience. My home was in danger of being sold as we were too broke to buy food and I failed an exam from my stress. 

After this moment, it all went downhill and I quickly found myself in this shitty state of mind again.

I have not had sex in two years. I am 21 years old. I feel like I am running out of time because I want to have sex and I'm young, but I cannot. I am attractive, but no women want anything to do with me. My guess is they sense my desperation, my anxiety, and my lack of living in the moment.


During this state of mind in February, my life changed completely. Girls wanted to talk to me, sit with me, share with me. I was genuinely happy. I didn't try or do anything. I was just myself but I don't know what myself is.



How do I get back to where I was? How do I get back to my incredible time during February? I am lost once again, unable to retrace my steps. Those same comforting images don't do it for me anymore.

Please help.",17Nov2017,2
44,"I have a pattern of being on antidepressants and being okay or doing great, and then it crashes and I have to be prescribed a new one.

I was okay for a while but I went back to a hospital for senior year and took the medication for a while but stopped because I moved out and couldn't pay for it.

I know why I'm there (I'm transgender) but it's difficult for me to say it. So I just said I don't really know. We sat in silence for an hour during my session. It made me kinda wanna cry and it also kinda pissed me off. I feel like she's given up on me and knowing that I don't feel comfortable with talkin about my problems.

47,"It was around 3 am and I really wanted to fall asleep. My eyes were nearly closing, but I resisted and kept them open. As a result, I got into this ""stoner state"", but afterwards, and that's the main reason why I am telling you guys here, was the feeling of extreme inner relief. 

It was a feeling I haven't felt for nearly 4 years now. Because of some incidences in the last 4 years, I really got a stick up mine's a**, it was a hard and tough time for me, really challenging, giving me nothing else than heartbreak, OCD, depression and nervous breakdowns. 

During this time, I've changed, I became more mature in thinking and living. In the end, although I went through sh*t, it ended up positively. But after being awake for a long time (it was like 20 hours), I suddenly felt like 4 years ago, again.

I had the feeling like this stick would come out of my a**, like I just would look at the world as a whole comedy show, not being serious about anything in particular. I was really relaxed, but not in this, let's call it ""yoga-relaxed state"", but rather relaxed in terms of not overthinking everything and not having inner monologues all the time. Instead of this, spending time on doing stupid and funny stuff seemed more fun to me. It's like I wasn't deciding/living rationally at that moment, but rather emotionally, something I've forgotten to do.

After staying awake for more time (I actually stayed awake for like 33 hours), this feeling faded away and I was ""normal"" again.

I highly suspect of me having the Asperger-Syndrome, or at least being on the autistic spectrum. My AQ is 42 of 50 and my EQ is 4 (a normal person gets around 60-70), there are also other symptoms I have like not looking in the eyes/unsocial behavior/etc. I don't know if this ""stick in mine's a**""/overthinking/inner monologue/etc. is really linked to Asperger's, but it could be plausible? The only thing which could be used to argue against it is that I wasn't like that 4 years ago, and as far as I know you can't get Asperger's. 

So, what do you guys think about that? It's just an interesting observation I've made, and I am very sad that this state only lasted for like an hour. Could that be linked to Asperger's, and is there anything I can do to be in this state again without not sleeping for 20 hours?",17Nov2017,1
48,"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and mild ADD (Prescribed Lexapro and Adderall). For about the past year, I've found that I intentionally put myself in situations so that I can be angry. 

For example, I will stay in a lane that I know people are going to try to merge into at the last minute just so that I can get pissed at them when they do it.

It's not just that I intentionally put myself in these situations, but that I look forward to them and am a little disappointed if the thing that will anger me doesn't happen.

Anyone else do anything similar to this that they've learned to control? I know it's something that is ultimately not good for me, but it's difficult to not enjoy it.",17Nov2017,8

50,"I went to a festival this year, did a lot of Mandy, and when I went back to the tent for the night I started hearing people talk about me.

It started off with me thinking that I could hear people talking about stealing our camping chairs, I obviously didn’t want this to happen so I was listening to every voice to see if I was hearing correctly. Anyway to cut a long story short, it escalated to me thinking that everyone in the entire festival hated me and could see through my tent/sleeping bag and were taking the piss out of my every move the entire night. For example when I licked my lips or moved my arm to get more comfortable.

I now realise that’s totally stupid but I still get flashbacks sometimes. I don’t hear clear voices talking to me like someone with schizophrenia, it’s more like when I hear strangers talking but I can’t quite make out what they’re saying, my brain interprets these voices/people as talking about me. It’s like they know how my mind works and are taking the piss out of me whenever I look in certain places or change the way I’m sitting. Any movement I make pretty much, and I think they know that I know they’re talking about me but I’m pretending like I don’t, which they also take the piss out of me for (does that even make sense?) 

Sometimes I try to counter them by staring in the same spot and not moving but they just take the piss out of me for that too. It’s like they can read my mind and know my insecurities. 

Anyway I’m just wondering what’s wrong with me and should I be worried, cos it really shakes me up.

53,"hi all, I mostly just need to vent a little bit. I'm feeling pretty low today. 

my mom's always been a fantastic parent, but she's also always had a stigma against mental health. I've been quietly sick for years, probably almost a decade now, but couldn't ever speak to her about what I was feeling. whenever I did try, I'd always feel a thousand times worse and it almost always lead to a huge emotional breakdown.

this past summer I was finally brave enough to reach out and admit that I'm not okay and want to get help. it's been a *huge* ordeal for me trying to get my mom to back me up and support me getting help. I've been told things anywhere from ""why would you hurt yourself? you have a great life"" to ""you are causing me so much stress that I don't need right now""

yesterday I saw my psychiatrist and will be starting medication this weekend. when I told my mom this the first thing she said was ""you can't be on meds your whole life"" and didn't say much else.

it's just so stressful. I've tried expressing to her that at the very least, even if she doesn't understand what I'm going through/feeling, *just support me* trying to get help. I feel so proud of myself lately for getting the help that I need, but my mom doesn't seem proud/happy for me at all. no encouraging words. it's making me second guess my actions and doubt if I should've even said anything at all. it puts me in a really bad place. sometimes I think I should've kept my mouth shut and continued suffering in silence.

For me, now is the time to start applying for jobs, networking, etc. My problem is that I feel like my depression/ADD really held me back from performing at my full potential and I feel like my resume might show that. My GPA is a little above a 3.0 so I know I shouldn't complain or be too hard on myself, but I think when compared to the other students in my major and what else they were able to accomplish, it's not as good as them. I couldn't even complete an internship over the summer because of how bad my depression/add was, but I'd say most of them did (one time we were asked to raise our hands in class if we had an internship and most of them did raise their hands, don't remember if there was anyone that didn't). I guess I just feel like my resume is not as competitive as theirs, and will be an easy toss out for recruiters and employers. I'm wondering if the best way to address it is through my cover letter, but I'm not sure how to do that. I know I shouldn't write in the cover letter ""I have mental illness!!!!!""

55,"She can be very selfish and bratty at most times. She's only nice to someone if she wants something. Otherwise, she always has a rude and hurtful way of treating people. She always a victim. She has anger issues and consciously breaks other people's things when she's upset (which is usually over very petty things). She complains that her friends don't like her, yet when they ask her to hang out she'll drop everything for them, even if we have family plans. If she is denied this, she gets angry. 

For example: On my birthday, we were going out. She was on board until her friend asked to hang out. So she said she wanted to go out with her friend, to which my mother told her no, and that she was going with us. To this, my sister got an attitude and said she'd just stay home. My mother again told her no, that she was going with us. Then my sister got mad and started crying.

After another one of her episodes, she was put on antidepressants. The thing is, I find something about her behavior to be off.  She hasn't put any effort into changing her attitude for the better. She's still a brat, and still very rude and selfish. I didn't feel bad for her before, just skeptical, and I don't feel bad now. I'm suspicious and annoyed.

I have a problem starting, keeping and trying out new things when it comes to relationships. Every relationship I'm in starts to feel bad for me after some time, it's like this weird feeling of wanting to have someone to love but at the same time just not giving a flying f*ck and having the desire of being single. This drives me mad to the point where I sometimes cry or react with anger to everything. It's very shameful to talk about it and explain, honestly, because it makes me feel bad some people can simply enjoy their lives with their partners yet I'm here feeling completely normal on an everyday basis without having slightly too much stress which is not problematic to a huge degree, but that's why I'm coming here first, I need someone to help me get my sh*t together because for now I am feeling weak and can't even get my ass to a psychiatrist/psychologist. I am a very happy person on an everyday basis and lately I've started to take care of myself more than ever when it comes to my picture on life and such, started thinking positively and actually caring about my future. I have a feeling of regret for any relationship I start, it comes after some time. I regret everything to the point where it drives me completely insane and angry because of the time wasted on a worthless relationship. I don't want to go beta or asexual, I enjoy sex and I'm not lacking it since one-night-stands are a normal thing for me every couple of weeks but the anxiety and fear and later regret of relationships (not like one-night-stands of course) kind of drive me to becoming beta or gay since I'm interested in both male and female, but I've never tried going gay. Most of my friends are men, I have an easier time talking with them and spending time. Then again I am from a country which is very intolerant to gay people - I don't give a shit about it but it's hard to find someone because of this.
If anyone knows any good ways to find gay guys just let me know even if you can't help my poorly explained problem above. I don't use social media besides facebook's messenger app at all, since I respect my privacy, just saying that inb4 someone says try social media groups - just please try to give me other advice than meeting them online even though it's the easiest thing.
TL;DR: When I get to a relationship, I feel bad, anxious, scared and break up and then regret both being in the relationship and breaking up since I know I could somehow fix it but I don't know how.
One last thing: Because all of this I am slowly starting to isolate myself from women for the most part, because of this. I don't like talking to them because they're boring (I'm still a teen so my school is full of thots), and we just don't share the same hobbies. Sorry for the mess, I will appreciate every drop of help.
