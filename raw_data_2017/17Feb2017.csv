4,"Schizophrenia and Borderline Personality Disorder. Lol even the crazies would call me crazy... But I guess I'm just bored with myself. Would like to talk to someone in the Nashville area, who has been to Hell and back, like myself, and discuss the existential, intangible, illigitamate, incomprehensible concepts of reality (or otherwise). And maybe, just maybe, against all odds of despair, find someone who gets it.... Or at least a connect to bounce ideas off of a few times a year... Trust me. Whatever your bullshit, I'll listen, and I will look into your soul and help you build something the world could never see...",17Feb2017,6
5,"TL;DR Been sad forever, fixed it like 98% through, started junior year, and now I cant tell if I'm depressed &amp; need meds or if I'm just stressed out. I was wondering what signs of chronic/chemically ""induced""(?) depression are like and how I might find out if I have a disorder.

All my life I've sort of been in a rut. My earliest memories are somewhat crisp, because I'm only 16 and not too far from them, but despite them being vivid, the emotions behind them were always muddy. Like, not too frequently when I was small, I would be having a blast being thrown around like a blanket in the wind and suddenly the smile would fade. I'd just be... I dunno, bored? Like the drop of a hat. I think it'd happen at least once a month, probably more as a kid. 

I started noticing it much more frequently as I got older. Once a month turned into once a week, once a week turned into everyday, and I hit rock bottom around 13 and a half. I started isolating myself, I didn't eat much, stopped talking to my friends as much, I didn't want to go to school which is unusual for me, I didn't want to do much of anything. I sat at home for hours on end and just lived online to escape the pain I felt everyday. Never once did I try to commit suicide, nor self harm, because I thought it'd hurt the people around me and be, well, boring, but I was definitely suicidal for probably a little under a decade. (I didn't really even think about it then, but I was sexually harassed for three-ish years and in an emotionally abusive relationship for about seven months all before the age of twelve. Now, I find myself getting flashbacks to my abuser's face and I wonder if it really did have an affect on me. Currently, I'm seeking a therapist or, I dont know, SOMEONE who can help me but it seems that every doctor in a 7 billion mile radius from here is booked.) It stopped around last year. I finally tried to figure out what made me feel the way I felt; I started really questioning what made me happy, who I am, and how to connect the two. The isolation still hasn't really ended as I find myself feeling more understood in my own company (no one else really has my brain, yknow?)

I was really happy for about a year, and then, not unlike when I was a kid, it just faded away. Summer of sophomore year rolled around and suddenly I was doing things like praying. I'm an athiest for my own reasons, but I felt so shitty I didn't really feel like I had anywhere else to turn. 

Now I'm three quarters through junior year, and though I'm generally happy, I still score high on depression/anxiety screenings. I don't want to take medication. I'm a pretty firm believer in the idea that I can talk through my problems, but I also have full faith in the medical community. If talking to someone wont help me, then where else do I really have left to turn?
I'm worried that medication is a cop out and that I'd be running from my problems rather than solving them.
Any insight is helpful. Thank you

EDIT: I just made my paragraphs clearer rather than having to read a giant block of horrible, terrifying text.

ANOTHER EDIT: Just for some extra perspective, I score around the 40's or 50's on the goldberg scale and all the screenings I've had with doctors usually place me in mild/severe depression and/or anxiety but normally in the severe. Despite this, I feel okay? Wtf?",17Feb2017,3

I'm looking for other ways to improve my mood and wellbeing for the sake of my wife and infant son and i was looking at a beginners yoga dvd and thought it would be worth a shot.

15,"Right, so this comes from not knowing how to deal with a very irritating oddball that happens to be in charge at work.

I can only list all the behaviours and things she does to see if someone has ever dealt with an individual this weird?

- Classic control freak, micromanager

- The control issues reflect on her own body (extremely thin, rarely eats, probably anorexic)

- Averse to change (says changes ""cause errors"") so always does things the same way even if there is a better or more efficient way

- Dyslexic, can´t spell even when auto correct is enabled

- Can´t write clearly, whatever she writes is impossible to decipher, looks like chicken scratches or alien code

-Keeps repeating the same little phrases/words when speaking to people (like blablablabal we are doing this and that DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, because then blablablabal DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, and also blablablablabl DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. and also if you can please blablab DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN) She can say it like 12 times in a space of 5 minutes, we have counted.

- Talks to herself, hums the same ""song"" which is not even a real song, but she hums the same 3 notes thing to herself which is really awkward, like, why?¡? Or repeats the same ""catchphrase"" like ayayaaaay at random moments ?¡? On a daily basis, been doing this for years.

- Cant stand still, always pacing and stomping around

- Lives a compartmentalised life, she keeps a very tight lid on her own private affairs but does question US about or private lives (the more she knows about us the more she can control and pre plan)

- Clearly has vision problems but does not wear contacts or glasses

- Neat freak in all respects and yet her writing/spelling/redacting is a mess, almost to the level of a not very bright 8 year old. 

- Lies blatantly to your face to always come across as being right.

- Waffles and bullshits when she does not have an answer instead of just admitting she doesn't know.

- Brags about leading a healthy lifestyle (yoga, healthy juices and teas, no smoking) yet when she falls ill, she gets like hospital bed ill.

17,"We are a small, disfunctional family so it's pretty much my aunt Susie, my cousin Jorge and me. I consider them more my mom and brother than anything.


There's a lot of mental illness that runs in our family. Jorge has been hit especially hard by it, but has never sought help, and seems opposed to mental health counseling. I've always suspected bipolar which was made worse by alcoholism, which runs in our family (sorry to play armchair psychologist). He's amazingly talented but he's never held a long term job or lived away from home. 


 This past fall Jorge's closest friend passed away very suddenly from overdose. We were all devastated, of course Jorge the most. It seemed like Jorge was taking it well, he quit drinking, he was pleasant to be around (we had many intense fights and there were years we went without speaking due to his drunken behavior). Not working, but helping Susie around the house and throwing himself into open-source design projects. 


The person  he was working on the open-source project with went on vacation for a weekend, and that's when it turned bad. Instead of working on the project, he started reading the news and within 24 hours he had ""uncovered"" this vast conspiracy. The details are irrelevant, but he is convinced that he pissed off some very powerful people by revealing the conspiracy, and our family is in grave danger.


He's already called the FBI, the cops, the Cia, several news outlets and Bernie sanders. Only eats packaged food (like canned soup) to avoid poisoning, he created a 2nd facebook and sends messages to himself to communicate with allies (I guess they're intercepting his communications?). Weapons are strategically stashed throughout the house in case of black-ops attack (no guns thankfully). No hallucinations that we know of, just complete paranoid delusion. 


So what now?  All the online resources I've checked seem to indicate that there's not much we can do but wait til he comes off of it, and hope we can talk sense into him then. Susie called NAMI and there wasn't much they could do, since he's technically not a danger to himself or others. We might be able to get a 3-day hold but that might make things worse if he thinks he can't trust us. She and I both have upcoming therapy appointments, but that's not for a week or so. 


 We suspect schizoaffective disorder, which is kinda like bipolar with some schizophrenia thrown in. Grandad had it. Cycling between mania, depression,  and total delusion. What I took as him doing well was possibly just a long manic episode. 


Susie is miserable, she can't even live a normal life because he thinks she's in danger of snipers shooting her thru the window while she watches tv. She's afraid he'll have some sort of episode where he mistakes her for an enemy and hurts or kills her. And of course she and I are both worried sick. i have no idea what to tell my 8 year old son. 


Had anyone gone thru something like this? I don't even know where to start or what advice to ask for. Please just help. 



  **tl;dr**: my cousin might be suffering from schizoaffective disorder,  he's completely paranoid delusional, terrified for his future, no idea what to do. ",18Feb2017,5

19,"Hello all - this is my first here, but I really need help. I was on facebook last night and some sort of sponsored headline popped up that someone liked. it was about a really terrible, horrible, shattering crime that caused massive harm. I wouldn't want to tell anyone about it for their sake. and since then I've cried intermittently and cannot move on. This is the second time this has happened to me - the first was the prolonged torture of a poor woman (who lived and seems to be doing okay now). It took weeks for that to leave my psche. I'm totally stuck. I've hallucinated, i've had attempts, etc, and this distress is comparable. I really don't know what to di. I tried googling things but could only find scientific studies. Is there advice for this? coping strategiess? any help or advice or such would be greatly appreciated. i'm not sure the above conveys how distressing this is for me. ",18Feb2017,1
20,"I never really thought about it properly until recently (had lots of major health scares). I realised that I'm not actually scared of dying for my own sake,I'm more just terrified about how the people who rely on me would cope- I'm my brother's carer and both my parent's have severe mental health problems, so find I'm supporting them a lot of the time. The idea of what would happen to them if I wasn't around fills me with dread

I guess I'm just looking for opinions and thoughts here; does anyone think this might be a negative thing? Is it something I should be looking to address? Or is this a totally normal way to look at life/death?

21,"Lately I've started getting really vivid dreams at night. Some are obviously dreams, but some nights the dreams aren't particularly obvious. They can be quite mundane and simple, like just sitting with a friend in a cafe chatting about stuff, texting friends etc.

As a result I've started to lose my grip on things a bit. I can't remember which conversations I've had with people have actually happened, and which I only dreamed about. 

I've found myself accidentally talking about secrets nonchalantly because I thought they knew about them when in reality they ""found out"" in a conversation that never happened, I've started talking to people and continuing conversations only to have them ask what on earth I'm going on about.

Is there anything I can do to ground myself or determine which memories aren't real? I don't like this. ",18Feb2017,7

25,"I've never really considered the idea that I might hear voices before, but recently it's becoming something I'm thinking about more. It's never been too distressing when it happens but I'm worrying about it a lot at the moment and was just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences. (For info, I'm diagnosed major depression and anxiety, possibly bipolar 2). 
The first thing I experience is something I definitely hear 'outside' of my head. I still think it *could* just be something that I'm actually hearing in the outside world but I can't be sure as no one else I'm with has ever heard it. Most recently I heard it while staying with my boyfriend. It sounded like it was outside the house and I'd describe it as hearing a large crowd of people chanting but just too far away to hear what they're actually saying. It was a pretty creepy noise. Now I'm definitely sure that that isn't what I heard (an actual crowd of people) but it's not impossible that the sound was created by something else. The first time I heard it I was on my own but the second time my boyfriend was there and I asked if he could hear it but he couldn't. He suggested it was noise from the pub a few doors down, but the weather was cold and it's very unlikely there were enough people outside for me to hear them talking (also why would they be chanting). I didn't press it any further because I didn't want to worry him. I don't hear this very often at all (maybe a few times a year) but it's enough to concern me, especially as I've heard it in lots of different places and situations.
The second thing I hear is definitely in my head. I have my own 'internal monologue' which is my own voice and thoughts and which is completely normal for me. But sometimes I hear others voices (often voices I've heard recently such as the character from a TV show). It's not like remembering something they've said, as what they're sayng is usually nonsense. It's weird because it's like they're making up the sentences or phrases themselves, like they're occuring completely separate from me, not like I'm 'making' them say it like I would with my own internal voice. They never say anything related to me, they don't tell me to do anything and it's not particularly distressing, just very strange.
Sorry for the long post, just felt the need to get this off my chest. I know that hearing voices, especially if they're not malicious or upsetting is quite a common occurence and not necessarily something to worry about. But has anyone experienced anything similar? Do you think it's something that would be worth bringing up with professionals when I next see them?",18Feb2017,1
26,"This mostly seemed to happen before I became agitated, anxious, and depressed, and I'm wondering whether anyone else has experienced this. Basically, talking, coming up with things to talk about, listening to someone, makes my head, ears, face very hot and uncomfortable. Usually, it only takes 10-30 minutes of intense socializing. Sometimes, I'll get a headache from it. I think I also remember feeling like I need to relax or cool my head off.

It was very hard to ""cool off."" I remember my mind just kept going and making it all worse. But I didn't feel bad, just uncomfortable with it.

It was explicitly caused by socializing. I'm a guy, I can't have menopause-related hot-flashes on demand.",18Feb2017,5
