Set in the USSR in 1980's - 

A man walks into a shop. He asks the clerk, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have any meat?‚Äù The clerk says, ‚ÄúNo, here we don‚Äôt have any fish. The shop that doesn‚Äôt have any meat is across the street.‚Äù",14Dec2020,1

6,"He‚Äôs alive. This date has been ingrained in the back of his mind for years. When he was diagnosed, he was young (39.) It was discovered remarkably early (stage 1B) when he was given a CT scan for a kidney stone. He had zero symptoms. 

Practically the best case scenario, yet still, was told repeatedly to ‚Äúunderstand, that almost everyone who receives this diagnosis lives between 1-5 years after discovery.‚Äù Remain hopeful, yet realistic. 

The cancer was fully removed with surgery, but ‚Äúunderstand, that recurrence is common.‚Äù

Five years, five CT scans, and no recurrences. 

It‚Äôs hard to put into words how fortunate it feels to get here. He made it five years. Five years after discovery.",14Dec2020,1

19,"Guys headed to fed camp

So I‚Äôve never made a post and not quite sure I‚Äôm doing this right, but I‚Äôll give it a try anyways. 

I just recently finished up a 60 month sentence at a fed camp, and while on pretrial for a year I was filled with so many emotions and so much anxiety, no knowing what was to come. I searched and searched, and I remember finding one post where the guy explained what life was like in there. And that‚Äôs basically what I want to pay forward. It may not be that you‚Äôre scared, you‚Äôre just anxious of the unknown. So I‚Äôm going to share what my experience was like, and maybe this post will someday help someone out and bring them a little relief in knowing what‚Äôs to come. 

Like I said in the title, I went to a fed camp, so the experience is going to be way different than people who went to state prisons or high security level prisons. But this was my experience..

So a brief disclaimer, I had one friend who was already there a year prior and so I had some comfort in knowing he‚Äôd help me get acquainted with things once I got in. He lived in a separate building, but we saw each other often. 

Leading up to my self surrender date was a bit of sadness mixed with urges to do as much as I could with my kid and enjoy every little moment I had left before I started my time. I studied a lot about Buddhist and stoicism and learned to be present in the moment more and appreciate things and to try and suppress emotions. Saying goodbye to my family that morning, I tried to keep things short and simple to prevent tears from shedding. My sister and friend drove me up, and I smoked and ate edibles the whole ride. It was a foggy November day when I got there and looked so gloomy. But I was high out of my mind and everything seemed like an adventure and was a little surreal. I got in, strip searched, piss tested, was given the whole no cellphone no drugs speech from my counselor who was a jerk off and kicked kittens...then got my linens and stuff and sat on the bench waiting to get my bed assignment. 

Pretty much, guys will approach you while sitting there, in a friendly manner, and talk to you. I was paranoid about there motives so was polite but short. I didn‚Äôt know these people and didn‚Äôt know how prison worked, but honestly, most were genuine nice guys just saying hi and meeting a new person they‚Äôd be living around. It was kind of funny because one of the guys my friend sent up to check on me when I got there since he was at work...actually turned out to be my bunkie! He had 3 months left, and he really was a great guy. We got along well and he helped me get situated and showed me the ropes. I couldn‚Äôt have had a better start. 

The compound was set up with an admin building, two main housing units, and then a separate building on the other side for rdap. There was a bunch of sports fields and a big huge gym, and then a road that led to all sorts of small buildings for facility jobs. Plumbing, maintenance, powerhouse etc. it was surrounded by farms and valleys and hills, and we were below a max facility which is why we were ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù.

So you kind of have to quickly accept the fact that you will be there for a while and this is your new life and the quicker you let go of trying to control people and life on the outside, the faster you‚Äôll relax and adjust. When I first got there I immediately said I‚Äôm going to get in shape. I‚Äôm going to leave there in better shape then when I came in. And working out my entire time there was how I really made the most of my time there. 

I won‚Äôt keep dragging this on,  but don‚Äôt be one of the people who waste years but eating snacks and watch tv all time. Build discipline, read, study, network, get healthy. Be productive. You‚Äôll be happy you did when you leave. 

The people in there, in a camp, are typically decent guys. We all are basically in for trying to get money some way or another, and we‚Äôre all just chillen and killing time together. A typical weekday will be like, wake up, depending on your job, you head to work, do some half ass work, head back down around 2. Then bullshit , maybe go to the gym real quick or eat early chow, then at 4 they do a count. After count, sometimes the cell phones came out and we had fun rec time since cops is in the admin building and rarely come search after 4pm, maybe a dickhead or two cops would but not many. Or if you play sports, and it‚Äôs summer, after count we have softball or football or basketball games. Take advantage cause you‚Äôll never really have time to be a kid and play sports again. I remember playing softball and not even realizing I was in prison. I loved the sports so much, it kept me so active and killed so much time. If there‚Äôs no sports, you might go workout to kill the night. The busier you stay the faster time will fly. Routines are lovely. 9:30 count, then lights out, and we usually chill on the phones or go to bed. And that‚Äôs the routines. Some people watch tv, gamble, get high, you know what it is. 

Just be aware you are dealing with criminals daily and be mindful of the arguments and debates you have cause some dudes ain‚Äôt wired right and get upset or offended easily. Best if you keep to yourself the first few weeks and then slowly find your people. Feel the place out first before you started being in the mix.

Courtesy flushes when you shit, shower shoes, be polite, don‚Äôt change the tv channels without asking people, shower daily, and don‚Äôt gossip. Don‚Äôt talk stupid on the wall phones or emails and don‚Äôt borrow or buy shit you can‚Äôt afford to payback. Once lights go out, be respectful and keep your voice down if you use the phone or text, speaker phone is obnoxious. If you do get a phone, go with the herd and put up when they do. Always lock your phone and sim. If you play sports, fucking stretch cause we old and pull muscles easy. 

Job wise, if you have a skill like plumbing or electrical cool, do that so it‚Äôll be easy. I got into fitness heavy so wanted to have access to good foods, so I worked in the warehouses and kitchen and always finagled my way into the best jobs and was able to eat meats salads eggs fruits allll day long. I went in at 225lbs and came out at 167 lean and cut up with abs. And believe me, it fades once your out because you ain‚Äôt got time like you did in there. But find a good job that fits how you wanna live...orderlies are good if you have money and wanna chill and do minimum work. Clean the bathroom (or pay someone to do it) or mop tv room floors. 20 min jobs. Gambling on football sundays is sooo much fun. So is winning 4 straight softball championships lol but yeah...just relax if you‚Äôre heading in. Yeah, your girl may leave you, it happens, but that‚Äôs life. Don‚Äôt be a bitch and act like a crazy jealous or sad dude, people listen and gossip. Play it cool and keep it moving. She wasn‚Äôt shit anyways if she ain‚Äôt wanna wait. It‚Äôs tough but you‚Äôll survive. Other than that, you‚Äôll be alright. Just let go of what you can‚Äôt control outside and enjoy the journey. It‚Äôs not as bad as you think it‚Äôs gonna be as long as you aren‚Äôt a dickhead. It‚Äôll be over before you know it. I hope this helps out anyone who‚Äôs heading in...oh yeah, lasagnas meals and chicken on the bone Thursday‚Äôs üëç good luck!",14Dec2020,1

26,"I'm drunk and not looking for sympathy. I'm simply posting this because I literally couldn't bring myself to discuss this with anyone in person.

Even a decade later I still cannot get over the fact that my brothers, my comrades, my family are dead. Seven people taken in a short period of time and I'll never get them back. I study quantum theory and understand how this smallest even can lead to catastrophic outcomes. Yet I can't make my peace with the chaotic nature of the universe that has stripped away the only real family I've ever had.

After all these years I haven't made a single new friend, and that's my fault alone. I feel like I can never let go of this loss and I can never get close to anyone ever again. So I sit alone, wallowing in my own misery while I decide if my placeholder friend will be Vodka, Whiskey or Beer. Just keep drinking and dealing with the PTSD and flashback. Keep coping with the fact that I'm probably going to spend the rest of my life alone in the friendship department.

Thank god I have a good partner who understands how I get into these spirals and mood swings. I know that drinking my sorrows away isn't healthy, at the same time it's either that or worse alternatives. I don't want to keep operating like some jackass who can't grieve and move on...but fuck it hurts badly.

I used to be a warrior. I used to live with purpose and a mission. Now I just repeat the same cyclical failings.

32,"I don't believe we should gate-keep who can identify as what. Everyone should have the freedom to identify as whatever they want. As of December 2020 we have things like catgender, pupgender, frostgender, Pichugender, stargender (all of them have articles on the LGBTQA wikia) etc.

Oxford has updated its definition of gender to now mean it's simply just what you identify as. Your gender is a cat? Fine, you're a cat. Your gender is a class C star in outer space? That's great, you're a star. Your gender is Japanese or Irish? That's perfectly valid, as well.

People identifying as a different race is fine, if it makes them happy to identify as a different race I don't see why we should give them abuse over it. Identifying as Japanese isn't really different from identifying as a cat (catgender) or a star (stargender).

If someone has an identity, and it has the suffix 'gender' at the end - that is their gender identity and you cannot change that. It is also transphobic if you harass anyone over their gender identity. If someone says they're (idk) ''Japangender'' and they identify as a Japanese person, you should respect their identity. If you don't respect it then you're literally being trans phobic and prejudiced",14Dec2020,1
41,"(Warning - I'm still not that good in English, so please excuse any grammar or punctuation mistakes if you notice any.)

I have an embarrassing confession to make that is related to my thoughts, fantasies and life in general. So, I'm going to spill each of my dirty secrets and mortifying life incidents in here.

I'm a 16-year-old Asian girl living in a strict and conservative family. A bit overweight people might say cause my body is, I don't know, curvy or big maybe? Well, a few days ago, I weighed myself and turns out I am 132 pounds already while my height is still the same - 157 cm. Though I did lose a ton of weight, compared to how I was one of the obese kid growing up in the family. People even predicted I had some sort of disease. 

I never considered myself beautiful though, but I don't hate myself for it, and instead of starving myself or doing any kind of self-harm, I flourished my personality and attempting to maintain positive energy around people. But deep down, it's suffocating to have these negative thoughts screaming in my head. They restrain me from being open and confident about my body. Looks like just accepting the fact that I've got no good looks is not enough for me to not fear people's judgements. Also, if this wasn't discouraging enough, my acne just got severe this month, to the point it turned into an infection. Now that I am on my medication, my face has healed a little but not entirely. After all this, it should be considered a crime if I call myself beautiful.

Now coming to my awkward life incidents - So, I‚Äôve always been more of an outgoing and extroverted kid who loves to make others laugh with her witty comments and quick tongue. However, with one cousin brother (six or seven years older than me) it would often be a little awkward. Like I need to be really protective and careful about myself while acting casually at the same time. Considering how, when he was 13 or maybe older, would try to check me down there at every now and then and even touched me once. One of the few things I can remember from that night is the pain; he pressed on the wrong area and it was fuckin painful. I was young enough to understand anything, so that incident died in me in silence. No one knew. Year's passed and it remained a bit awkward between us,  He acted like nothing happened and I did the same. Like, even if his hand would unintentionally touch my body, I'd immediately predict it's intentional.

In this post, I don't wanna lie at all so no matter how offending it sounds, I still wanna spill it all out. When I turned 14, I started fantasising about him doing his way to me. Not only him, but I also fantasized myself with older people like one of my teachers. It soon stopped though. 

Now I don't want any kind of sexual interaction at all and as I started getting y life together, my other relative brother started acting weird. The only kid who‚Äôs younger than me in the family, so of course, I adored him to bits. But two weeks ago, he tried to touch my breast, pinch nipple and even tried to stuff his face in them, it took me a few seconds to realise what he was trying to do and I told him off immediately and he stopped but before I could tell him why it's wrong to touch someone without consent, we left from there due to an urgent meeting Dad had. A week later, his parents called us over for dinner again which I refused to join and my parents came home telling me how much he missed me that night.

But after this incident, my fantasies are going wild again. I daydream about getting manhandled by my uncle and that's terrible! I don't know what's wrong with me. Now that I'm putting these on the Internet, I feel like I'm decorating my pain. It feels like I'm craving for attention.",14Dec2020,1

43,"(I originally posted this in r/depression because that‚Äôs usually the sub i go to for help in dark times but to be honest, i‚Äôm not depressed right now, just feeling extremely anxious and unmotivated)

So I‚Äôm 18 and it‚Äôs becoming increasingly evident that i can‚Äôt really.... do anything. Or at least I‚Äôm just so useless at sticking with it for longer than a week, that i‚Äôm basically just like any other incompetent person.

It‚Äôs been like this my whole life. New school year? Make an effort for the first two weeks, get 95% in two assignments and then stop showing up. New hobby? I dink around with it and fantasize about being the best that ever lived (massive privileged white male ego on me as well) until I realize how incompetent i am at it and instantly want to give up. It‚Äôs genuinely the most discouraging shit having my brain coddle me with thoughts of greatness like ‚Äúoh wow maybe this change will finally be the change that can set me straight!‚Äù And then because i have the attention span of a fucking goldfish and fewer skills than i actually think, it inevitably flops. 

Like, i recently decided to stop my daily routine of basically just smoking weed and playing video games, and am trying to gradually replace it with natural endorphins and actually creative hobbies. Why? Because it was making me miserable and stagnant in life and i KNOW that i can be creative. It was great! For the first 2 goddamn days. (No shit) Now i‚Äôm miserable, and it‚Äôs not like i dont know why, i know exactly why I‚Äôm miserable. I aaaalways want more. Always always always. Never satisfied! Never content.

The same brain thats telling me to do something with my life and make important changes is ALSO telling me to do jack shit, and is PLACING THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD to make sure i do jack shit. Like what kind of fucking life is this? You mean to tell me i have to BELIEVE my brain when it tells me to make change, but instantly discredit what that same brain has to say moments later? And all of this isnt even to have a good life, its to remain even REMOTELY stable and conscientious. Is this a joke? 

Over the last weeks i‚Äôve been trying to produce hip-hop music as a kind of ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù for mindless media consumption but I basically made one competent song like a week ago and now my brain is just void of ideas completely. And its like... well time to give up! You clearly arent good at this! You clearly werent MEANT to do this.

Today, i took a good look at my coworkers and all of my imagination and goals were completely sapped the fuck out of me, like a punch in the gut. These are people who are likely extremely kind, thoughtful, intelligent, moreso than me. But here they are, almost 30, and working part-time at canada‚Äôs LAAAAAAAAAARGEST GROCERY STORY CHAINüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ!! Shit like that makes me realize that being talented, gifted, having ideas of any kind isnt even half of anything important. It‚Äôs all about your desire to actually do things, to participate in life, and this is something i may never have for long enough to get a single thing done. 

This is quite unlike what i was told my whole life, misguided compliments such as ‚Äúthe world is your oyster, you just need to apply yourself!‚Äù That‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúyou have nice hair but your face is fucking horrendous!‚Äù

I‚Äôm such a coddled bitch and sometimes it feels like all i do is sap resources from this beautiful planet. Was I meant to be a story of how NOT to be? Will I continue to do activities that supplement real life until my soul is drained from my body and i rot away in this godforsaken attic under my parents care, never leaving the nest?

46,"I can't stand my housemate at all. Often times when I hear him I get enraged and have a mini spaz which is incredibly unpleasant. His room is relatively far from mine, but there is a kitchen between us which is relatively close. Just hearing him close a drawer is enough to piss me off. 

He talks extremely often. He'll talk in the kitchen with his airpods. He'll talk in his room. I can always hear it and it drives me mad. I hate going out to the kitchen to get food so much, I literally spaz out several times over the course of getting food just from hearing his voice from down the hallway. 

On the flipside I also can't stand making noise that he will hear. In the morning I get extremely stressed out from knowing that he can hear me preparing breakfast. I feel some sort of guilt or anxiety. I feel as though since I get incredibly annoyed at hearing him that I logically feel bad for making any noise that he himself can hear. 

I feel that it doesn't help that I hate him as well. Even though I rarely have to interract with him, the few times that I did have made me find him repulsive. He loves to talk about politics and race, he will tell the most dull joke and then forcefully laugh like a hyena and he is obsessed with Donald Trump to the point where he puts him on a pedestal and spouts conspiracy theories regarding him. ""Did you see how they came out with a vaccine right after Biden won?"", ""China is trying to take over the world, but Trump is smart he knows that they're doing"". This is despite him literally being Chinese. 

I once went to see a movie with him and the entire time he was invading my personal space with his foot and making extremely obnoxious noises by shuffling around in a polyester jacket. It got so bad that I had to leave the movie halfway through just to escape the stress I was feeling. 

I once told him about a video game I was making on my PC and he shut me down and told me that ""mobile gaming is what you should do"" outright without even knowing what I was doing. 

I have been pissed off in ways similar to this with everyone I've ever lived excluding my brother, but I can't live with him anymore for various reasons. I left my parents home for these exact same reasons but worse, and it pisses me off. I feel like the only situation is to find a way to live by myself or with somebody I truly get along with, but I don't know how to do that. I have a lot of money saved up but not enough to live on my own for more than a year, and I am honestly just considering doing extremely risky stock investments just to have a chance at finally getting my own place. This honestly makes me depressed so much to the point that I'd consider gambling my money like that.

Meanwhile she's grown into a handsome little lady and she's much, much more affectionate than I'd ever dreamed she would be. Kisses on command, absolutely adores pets and falling asleep on your lap or shoulder. Gets along great with the cats as well.

When she's in her cage and I'm nearby, I can often hear her quietly singing. I mean, seriously whistling tiny melodies, like a songbird would. I didn't even know chickens were capable of that.

There have been about 300 cases in the last 200 years.

Whenever I see people walking around I always feel scared for them, I imagine all of a sudden they're clenching their stomach and then out bursts blue flames.. then they burn to death.

77,"I've noticed there's this bias that no one talks about. It basically works where a person learns about something, believes the thing, can't remember what it was like to not believe the thing, and then becomes convinced that they've *always* believed the thing. 


I was thinking about it while reading Otherkin stuff, I saw some people saying how they *always* knew they were X character from some film that only came out a few years ago or whatnot. Not here to debate otherkin, just explaining why this is on my mind.


But when it comes to identity stuff, it's really hard to know if someone has literally always felt this way, or if they just recently started and then became convinced that they had always felt this way. Perhaps they happened not to have a lot of friends or happened to be a bit different than those they surrounded themselves with, and then looking back tried to put a label on it? Like they couldn't remember why they were isolated then, but know that they would be isolated if they believed then what they believe now, so that must have been why they were isolated in the first place?

I'm not sure.

This is going to get lost to the sea of the internet so I might as well rant about whatever. 

 I can't keep going on like this. Life feels like it's just dragging on and on. I feel like I've been here forever. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I've had so many different jobs too, I don't feel like I'll ever find a job I truly enjoy. I hate doing this. I hate being a wage slave. I just want to run away and never come back. I don't know where I wanna go but I know I don't want to be here. Why did we have to evolve like this. We only have about 75 years on this earth. 12 of those years are spent being forced to go to school 8 hours a day 5 days a week. And after that you either go to college for 4 to 8 years or you go straight into the work force. Then you work and work and work for barely anything to scrape by no time to do anything fulfilling in your life and by the time you retire you're too old to do anything. It just seems like no matter what I do I'm going to regret it. After I've worked somewhere for a while I start to hate it so much and I look at every little thing as a reason to quit and I end up quitting. I've only been at this job since the start of November and I hate it already. Why is it so stressful, I feel like I'm nothing if I'm not making money. The things I used to love doing as a kid just feel like a mountain that I'd rather avoid climbing over. I dont want to keep living in a world where I can't survive if Im not making enough money. I don't want to live like this. I never feel not stressed anymore. Sleep has just become another part of my day, I don't feel refreshed after I wake up anymore. I feel like I'm crawling out of my skin anymore. And it doesn't help that I don't have insurance. I can't get a therapist without insurance and and to get insurance I need to make money. Why do I need money to live. Why aren't the bare necessities to live a right in this country?? The rich make me so fucking sick. They were all born into their money, they're so fucking greedy. I cant take living in this world where I need to work myself to death just to live, that makes to fucking sense. We should be able to do what makes us happy without worrying about when our next meal is or when we're sick will we be able to afford going to the hospital or afford the medication. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want something to change or I just want to die plain and simple. It's the easy way out and nobody know what or if anything comes afterwards. Whatever it is, it's better than this.

92,"Shattered Ego From past Toxic Relationship

The relationship I‚Äôm referring to has been over for two years now. But the effects are still paramount for me today. I (24F) was with him (24M) was with him for five years. I don‚Äôt want to go over everything that happened; it is a very long story. The relationship was toxic. I wasn‚Äôt healthy to be with and he wasn‚Äôt healthy to be with either. 

I never cheated or anything like that. I had trust issues and was insecure. It was also the first real serious relationship I‚Äôve ever been in. No excuses for how I acted on my part, but it is true. He was young as well; and looking back, had insecurities of his own. He looked for validation from women often. Telling random women our problems, emotionally cheating with another, kissing a random girl at an airport, and finally letting another woman give him a blowjob (something he never let me do). God it still hurts and shocks me to this day.

To say I took a mental beating was the least that could be said. I felt like I was constantly fighting myself and for the relationship. When we broke up I had a mental breakdown. He expressed how relieved and happy he was on his own. That hurt, I just feel like I was constantly being kicked at my lowest. I gave every effort I had and I get that. He married almost a year after all that. 

My ego is absolutely dead. I have no confidence. Or faith that I will find another. I just feel like another will hurt me. Nor am I looking for a relationship; I am not ready for one. 

I am more concerned about having more drive in my life. I want to be confident. Before the relationship I had a lot of spirit and tenacity. Now I‚Äôm self loathing and fear I won‚Äôt be able to go back to that person. That relationship, his happiness, the cheating is a bane on my back I can‚Äôt seem to shake. I feel unworthy and despite my new cynical viewpoints on life and relationships; I fear I‚Äôll never find love again. Someone who loves me for me and wouldn‚Äôt hurt me. How do I not let my ego block my future? 

 How do I heal my self worth or ego?

104,"
I think deep down I‚Äôm a massive hopeless romantic and have this fantasy somewhere that some girl‚Äôs gonna just come into my life and make everything okay and everything will have been worth it, but I‚Äôve been alive 22 years now and increasingly as I grow older the idea of ever even experiencing that kind of love just seems completely and utterly unbelievable to me. I‚Äôm a virgin who‚Äôs never even came close to a relationship. I believe that love exists, but just not for me. This isn‚Äôt even in some self pitying and hating way, but it just seems like a complete and utter cold, hard fact to me.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything really inherently wrong with me as a person. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm the ‚Äòfunny one‚Äô out of my friends for as long as I can remember, I look a hell of a lot better than my ugly duckling high school years, I‚Äôm socially awkward but in a way I think most find endearing rather than are put off by, I have lots of friends both male and female, I‚Äôve always been scared I‚Äôd like creep girls out by flirting with them or whatever, but my woman friends always laugh at me saying that and tell me that I‚Äôm the most harmless person they‚Äôve ever met and it would be impossible for that to ever happen. People do tend to come round to me once they get to know me. 

But I‚Äôve just never clicked romantically with anyone. I‚Äôve had flirtations or whatever, but I just think in many ways I‚Äôm inherently unlovable on that level and the idea that anyone would get to know me and think to themselves ‚Äòyep, this is the guy for me‚Äô is just baffling to me. I‚Äôm too scared to flirt with anyone, scared of commitment and opening up to anyone; I‚Äôm not exciting, I have like no real interests, I‚Äôm too much of a people pleaser and have major self confidence issues which people subconsciously sense a mile off. I think most girls kind of take pity on me and see me like a little puppy, but pity is the death of the desire as they say. I‚Äôm not terrible looking, but there‚Äôs nothing in the way I look or my goofy ass surface level personality that is all I show to people that by I think could ever have anyone thinking ‚ÄòI want to tear his clothes off‚Äô. I‚Äôm just not that kinda person; I‚Äôm too sexually reserved, never say what‚Äôs on my mind, too anxious when I like someone, too stuck in my own head, etc.

I just can‚Äôt imagine ever being in a relationship. I love the idea of one, but I know I‚Äôd be a shitty boyfriend, wouldn‚Äôt know how to maintain build and maintain that connection with someone and couldn‚Äôt keep anyone interested once they got to know me and realised there‚Äôs like nothing there worth sticking around for below the surface lmfao.

111,"(Throwaway account so she can't find me o3o)  


So, to start this off a little back story (I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom if you want to skip to that). Me and my girlfriend are long distance right now. We live just about 700 miles away from each other currently. I'm going to be going to stay with her for awhile in a few months and while I'm out there we're going to be looking for a place.  


I had this original plan where every day for the last six months up until I see her I'd write down in this journal how we're doing, anything important that's been going on with either of us. I also wrote a bunch of cheesy stuff about how much I love here and this long two page list detailing everything I love about her as they came up. And at the end of writing, the day before I have the flight to go see her, I was going to write this long thing about how much I care about her and love her then when she's done reading ask her to marry me. *Well,* I did keep up with it for awhile! But we've both been working so much that when we get in our daily call and sleep calls we're both just so tired and exhausted we end up just chilling or starting our sleep call early. So, six months in and a couple months to go and I'm not even half way through the book ;u;

That brings me to Plan B!  ***A VIDEO!!!*** What this video will be is a video detailing our relationship, when it first started, the little bumps in between. It'll focus on how through all the drama and rocky parts we've been through, both together and by ourselves, we were able to pull out together. How yeah, there were times when we fought and argued about stupid stuff a lot, but in the end our love was stronger. (that sounds so cheesy, I'm sorry ;u;)

What I also want to do is get her friends, my friends, and our mutual friends in calls without her knowing and ask them questions and record their answers for the video. Stuff like how they felt about our relationship, good times they had with her, embarrassing stuff they saw us go through. Their first impressions of us and what their thoughts would be if I asked her to marry me. And how they feel about her.

I don't want this to just be about me asking her to marry me but like an appreciation video for her so to speak? She does so much for everyone and cares so much about all her friends and family but sometimes she'll get in this head space where she feels alone and feels so shitty about herself. I want her to know how much everyone loves her. What I want to know is what exactly I should ask our friends? I have everything else planned out but I don't know what exactly to ask them. I want to ask them all the same/similar questions and throughout the video as those points come up I'm going to edit in their responses.  


&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I'm planning a video to ask my girlfriend to marry me and I want to get our friends involved by asking them questions to use their responses in the video but I don't know what to ask them.

118,"Today marks the second day my closest and only true friend, who I‚Äôve known for years, the saviour of my life, and the only person I‚Äôve ever truly loved and has loved me back, Sam, has ghosted me. We had a minor disagreement over some dumb shit, stuff that I didn‚Äôt even care about a few hours after it had happened, and I left his last DM on read in a moment of frustration‚ÄîMy depression had flared up particularly nastily that day, as well as my chest condition which causes me pain throughout the day, which aggravated me towards this. 
Now, he‚Äôs blocked me on everything I have except for Discord, and on Discord he has himself set to offline 24/7 and won‚Äôt respond to any of my messages, no matter how desperate they may sound. 

More than anything, it‚Äôs confusing: Why would he do this? He‚Äôs always been confident, supportive, loving. He told me every night that he loved me, we would talk together every day. We‚Äôve been through far worse, had far more heated arguments in the past, and he‚Äôs shown me nothing but love and forgiveness and is always willing to take me back, or apologise himself. So what, did I kill this friendship with our silly little spat? It doesn‚Äôt make sense.
I can‚Äôt help but blame myself: I was the one who stopped responding. I got back to him once I woke up to tell him I was sorry, but by that point he had begun to stonewall me. Did I do this? Is it my fault? Have I finally driven him away, like, deep down, I always thought I would?

Of course, I can imagine one reason why: Maybe he just needs space. That‚Äôs what I tell myself. His grandfather has been seriously ill and they know he‚Äôs on the cusp of death. I don‚Äôt know how close they were, but regardless I know it‚Äôs something that stresses him out. He‚Äôs also contending with finals in his first year of college while struggling with ADHD, and has also told me he‚Äôs been grappling with ‚Äòfriendgroup drama‚Äô  beyond me. As well as that, another friend had also called him up in a panicked state, threatening to kill himself, and although Sam attempted to talk them down he hasn‚Äôt heard from them since, and is understandably fraught with worry for them. 
Is this it? Has the stress finally cracked him? Does he just need space? I wish I knew. I wish he would spare me just one more second and tell me. I wish I could cross all six thousand miles between us and ask him, tell him everything‚Äôs going to be alright, be there for him. 

But I don‚Äôt know. And I don‚Äôt think I ever will. He sits idle in one private Discord server we share, but I fear it‚Äôs only a matter of time before he leaves there, too. He refuses to respond to any attempt to reach out to him‚ÄîI‚Äôve stopped trying. There‚Äôs nothing left to try. I just told him I would give him some space and I said I was sorry. Our DMs are just empty echoes of a happier time, my pleas for closure falling silent against them. 

December is the cruelest month for me: It‚Äôs usually when I crack, when my anxiety and depression get to me and I suffer like no other month, worse every year. This time, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to get through it without him. I don‚Äôt think I can go on without him‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know why I would. I‚Äôve laid around miserably since he cut me off, falling between crying and mindless scrolling, casting occasional glances to Discord only to see his account offline still. I couldn‚Äôt sleep last night. If I make it out the other end of December, it‚Äôll be in a mental institution. 

I have no grand closing point to make because this story has no grand closing point: I still lack closure. He still hasn‚Äôt spoken to me. He‚Äôs gone, and I‚Äôm left scrambling to pull myself together and make it out of all this. I‚Äôm alone again, and this time I don‚Äôt think Sam will come swooping in to drag me from the depths of despair like before. I just hope I can make it through this. 

Thank you for reading this‚ÄîI had to get this off my chest somehow. Please, call or text your best friend and tell them you love them. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs ‚Äúgay‚Äù or ‚Äúweird‚Äù‚ÄîJust please, let them know you care.

Don't think COVID19 is a serious threat because of it's low mortality rate? Mask up, you're still making people uncomfortable, and you're not helping your cause.

Don't agree with lockdowns affecting small business and the rising unemployment? That has nothing to do with having a mask on. Mask up, anyways, since you risk having these business who are still open actually get shut down.

I, for one, don't agree with the shut down of businesses without providing a stimulus package to help those unemployed, but I still wear my mask because *NOT* wearing it will just cause *MORE* businesses to close.

Like, what's the endgame? ""I'm not gonna wear a mask, therefore this should spur our politicians to open up our economy""?? Because that makes no god damn sense. The more Anti-Mask people we have roaming around, the more businesses are at risk of closing, and the longer these shutdowns will last.

120,"I was on and off with my ex for 6 years. Broke up with him every 2 years like clockwork. He was my best friend however we were mirror images of each other. Ultimately that relationship dissolved because sex wasn't cutting it (it never did we just made it work) and although he could've done without it (he was older and was at a point in his life where sex wasn't as important to him in a relationship) I still felt it was important for me. He was nothing but good to me and the way I ended it I deserve to never see his face again and live with the burden of that. 

Guy I'm seeing now is a bit younger than me. Again nothing but good to me. I don't feel as understood by him as I did with my ex but my ex was just better than most about connecting with people and really zoning in on someone. However my bf now is a good guy. Long story short I wana break up because I don't feel I love him as much as I should. I still have unresolved feelings with my ex and just my past in general. I feel I'm sticking with him because I'm just so terrified of being alone. I told him all this and although he gets that I have issues I need to work through, he doesn't wana break up. He says he wants to be there for me. For the record, we do get along well and I do care about him and I can see in his eyes how much he cares about me.

I'm not someone who's ever believed the saying ""you can't love anyone until you love yourself"" but now I'm starting to see that might be true. My ex is my soulmate. We intrinsically understood each other and connected at a deep level. We were the same person. If it wasn't for the sex I'd have stayed. I'm even wondering if I did wrong by leaving because ultimately isn't it about companionship anyway? He gave me everything. Unconditional love , a loving home, protected me from the world in every way imaginable. And I still rejected it. When he's not in my life the world feels dark and scary. He wasnt just my partner he was my family. He filled a lot of the gaps I had in my life and without him I feel more lost and alone than ever. I know I need to work on my issues and learn to be ok with myself and with being alone and I really hope I can because I don't know if I can live with myself knowing I buried something rare. 

I think I'm doing the right thing by breaking up with my bf now even if it hurts him in the short term and even if I'm probably gona go crazy being alone. Problem is he's pretty fucking great and is always willing to work through issues. I don't know what to say to him to have him get it.

Hi, I‚Äôm 17 and my boyfriend is older we‚Äôve been together a couple of years now and he doesn‚Äôt go out and if he does it‚Äôs very rare... I mean doesn‚Äôt have a job doesn‚Äôt leave his house. His mum passed away recently she was only young from cancer which set him back even further. The thought of hun going out knocks me sick with anxiety. This is because when he does go out, he goes at like 6 in the day and comes home like 3pm THE FOLLOWING DAY. he goes to raves and does drugs (I know he would NEVER cheat on me ) but I don‚Äôt want him to go. The thought of me being without him knocks me sick. I don‚Äôt even like him going to his friends. I am aware how possessive, selfish and jealous I am and I have left him today because I can‚Äôt get over it. I have left him for him. Have I don‚Äôt the right thing or is there ways I could get passed this? We spend 100% or our time on FaceTime even when we go to sleep and I see him every weekend but he never goes out so when he does I‚Äôm lost, jealous and scared he‚Äôs having more fun than he does with me. I don‚Äôt need anyone coming for me, i know what I am and what I‚Äôm like which is why I left him ecause he deserves better. He says he stays out till that time with his friends because he never sees them he only sees them months apart at a time which I do get. But I‚Äôm struggling, we‚Äôre PERFECT otherwise and this is our only issue. So basically have I made a mistake and is there a way I can get psssed this? 

TLDR: can I really stay with my boyfriend work things out if I am unable to let him go out and I‚Äôm very controlling? I‚Äôm really trying ü•∫",14Dec2020,1

133,"I started using captions about a year ago and didn't realize how accustomed I had become until today, watching ""Gattaca"" on some random station on my Roku. For some reason the closed-captioning isn't working and I can't understand twenty percent of what they say! The dialogue parts are so quiet I crank the volume to hear and then it's too loud during the action parts. I've had to rewind several scenes to try to catch what someone says, sometimes multiple times because what if it's a crucial element of the story? I need to understand those words!

This all feels like so much work. I really miss those comfortable, easy words on the bottom of the screen. Closed-captioning, I love you. Please don't ever leave me again.",14Dec2020,1
135,"And yeah, I get it. I understand the curiosity. I do that sometimes. 

But you won't find any surprising things here. There is still mediocrity in all the things that I do, that I say, and most of who I am. The outcome so far can be justified by the pain that I caused and the unfair things I've said to you. There is not a single day I don't think about it.

This is on me, though. I know the life I have to live. This is something I will have to deal with on my own. I know it is unrepairable and I won't be able to make amends. I will continue processing the things that we lived together and get reminded daily that the responsibility is on me. And I will continue missing you, regretting the pain I caused and the extent that you had to endure it. I am sorry.

But for you, I don't know what you can gain by coming here. There is nothing of value you can extract. If you reminisce the time I threw shit on you, what good can come from it? Anger, more pain? I lack the opportunity to heal it. I tried, in my own chaotic way, and it didn't do anything. My only option is to accept it and wait time complete its directive.

I don't know much about you after you left. Just some things here and there. I read a few texts you produced. Nothing personal. The joy of learning from you never ceases. It does saddens me that I won't be able to spend  the hours we used to have and listen to you and re experience the gift it is to talk to you and get a sight of your thoughts and reasoning. I accept we will most certainly never see each other again. As I said then, and as I still believe today; I was lucky to have had you in my life. Just not worthy of it.

I was also glad to know that 2020 didn't bring you down. Although quite not surprised. The world can crumble into pieces while you will stay firm, like a bronze statue of someone who cannot be forgotten.",14Dec2020,1

137,"All day today ""breaking news, the electoral college to cast its votes.""

This is not breaking news. This has been set up for a long time. But they keep doing the ""breaking news, oregon has cast its votes for Biden.""

The other day they litearlly had ""Breaking NEWS! Playgrounds to open up!""

I just want to punch these newscasters. There's a local channel whose news cast does this three or four times a broadcast ""Breaking news: Fire this morning on the other side of town."" It's news from this morning but they use the ""breaking news"" to start the report. I stopped watching this shit channel.",14Dec2020,1
140,So for some reason I always surround myself with people that always put me down and tell me that everything that I do is wrong and generally just make me feel like I‚Äôm worthless. How do I stop people form treating me like that?,14Dec2020,1
143,"This one is for all my college students out there hopefully at least a few of you will understand. Used to be a great student getting straight As and whatnot. Quarantine hit and I blink my eyes and now I'm just a self-loathing degenerate with terrible grades and mountains of stress. Really went from 2 weeks extra of spring break to the most depressing period in my life. I'm not here to start a pity party, but damn it just feels like my life has gone to shit. I used to grind school and love it, sometimes my grades wouldn't satisfy me but hey at least I was on the right track. I started smoking a lot over quarantine and it made me a bit lazy going back to school in August. Grades started dropping, and instead of dealing with it by pulling up my grades I dealt with it by smoking or going out. I really feel like I don't know myself anymore. My friends told me they noticed a difference in my personality and I think they are worried. My parents haven't noticed anything they just keep telling me to keep getting good grades which only adds on to the stress. 

I'm a big nerd and I love working out, in fact, working out used to be the main way I would deal with stress. Now I just combat my anxiety with things that cause more anxiety: weed, alc, tiktok, procrastinating. Even as I am typing this I'm supposed to be studying for a Chemistry final that will determine my grade. I rlly don't know why I'm writing this, maybe I thought some other college ppl would comment and tell me they can relate and somehow that would make me feel better. But in reality, I've reached a point where I'm ashamed of my past semester, ashamed of my present self, and scared for my future. Used to have it all figured out; go to college get a degree be smart with my money and live the happy life but now I feel like that is in jeopardy and I can't tell if it is quarantines fault or my own. Idk ranting online helped a bit, gotta get back to studying. I know my life could be much worse; I'm grateful for being able to go to college in the first place and be able to have a roof over my head, but I guess there are big ups and big downs for people from all walks of life. Idk though I'm just some dumb college kid. If anyone reads this and feels my pain I hope you know you're not the only one going through this. Peace.",14Dec2020,1
145,"Now I am new to reddit so I apologize if this in anyway not how Im supposed to do this. But I needed somewhere I could express my disappointment and vent as most people don't know.

I (27F) am a mom who already works over 40 hours a week but somehow still struggles to keep up with finances and so I decided that I was going to start an onlyfans. But as with everything else I have attempted to supplement my income to get us back on a level playing field, I can't even get a single fan. Granted I am sure there are factors that I am not aware of or don't understand, however it still hurts a little bit that I can't even manage to sell some pictures just to make a little extra cash like a lot of people that I know do on that website.

Maybe I have some sort of flaw I can't see that keeps me back from making these a success or maybe I'm just ugly I guess? I have no idea but I'm almost atmy wits end.

If you read this, thank you for listening",14Dec2020,1
147,"So I do all the cooking in the house. I love cooking and reading recipes so I love it. But sometimes I don‚Äôt feel like it. We WFH so I make our lunches in addition to our dinner. I made his favorite lunch today- rice with a fried egg and kimchi with 2 hot dogs (I can make gourmet Indian, Mediterranean, Japanese, etc but he has basic tastes). He spilled his lunch by accident all over the floor. Big sad for me because I felt full in my heart making him his favorite meal during my short lunch break with leftover time to hit the treadmill. I offer to make him other things all declined until he makes himself 3 hotdogs- I do all the grocery shopping and bought them cuz it‚Äôs all he will make for himself for the days I‚Äôm not home to make lunch and I worry about him not eating because he‚Äôs soooo thin. Obviously he‚Äôs not hungry for dinner but I had asked him to make burgers tonight cuz hes comfortable with that and I didn‚Äôt feel like cooking. He says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to cook tonight.‚Äù I get excited cuz I think he‚Äôll make those burgers. ‚ÄúOh! You‚Äôre cooking!?‚Äù Him: ‚Äúum no. You can cook if you‚Äôre hungry.‚Äù So here I am 3 troegs on an empty tummy later drunk and disappointed. But he looks so sweet sleeping. He promised to cook tomorrow. But I‚Äôm disappointed in myself for getting drunk rn.",14Dec2020,1
148,"But I'm a shell of a person.

I'm such a spineless coward that the smallest set-back destroys me. I can't hold a job for the more than 3 to 4 months at a time without having a complete mental breakdown. I have zero willpower. I can't even stick to a small diet change without instantly losing motivation. I tried to stop drinking soda to at least try to take baby steps toward sorting my shit out, but I gave up the following day. chugged a can of Monster Punch (TM) first thing in the morning, which is also the same time I usually finally fall asleep.

I hate having bursts of motivation. Sometimes for a month or two at a time I'll be productive and semi-social, I feel like maybe I'm getting over this, but it's usually always just a cruel trick and like a junkie I eventually relapse. Fuck, I had to move back in with my mother the last time I fell into this hell. I'm still relying on the goodwill of my mother and I've never felt more like a pathetic, useless, worm in all my life. All I can do is whine and self loath which makes me feel even worse. it's a fucking hellish cycle.

All I want is to have the problems and stresses of non-inflicted people. I would give a decade of my life for relationship and workplace issues. At least those problems don't consume your entire being like an inescapable void. The meds don't work. I'm starting to understand why people form drug habits. My one time experiment with MDMA was the only time I can truly recall real happiness.

I'm still looking for that magical sentence, moment, or medication that makes the world stop and just make sense for once. It's difficult to shake the feeling that life is a joke that everyone's in on except me. Is there something I'm missing? I'm just so tired. Of everything. trying to to achieve happiness is exhausting energy I don't have to spend.

I'm sorry for spouting ""I"" so much. There's already too much self obsession in this world and spouting the word ""I"" makes me feel guilty every time It escapes my mouth. Just felt like getting my thoughts out there in the physical world ""I"" suppose.",14Dec2020,1
