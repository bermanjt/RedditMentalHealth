3,"Hi! I am currently a sophomore and am not on campus because all of my classes are online due to COVID. But for this year, my roommate and I were supposed to live with this two other girls on campus (we've never met them but have met them through our class' facebook group). My roommate ended up switching schools anyway, so now I do not have anyone to live with (that I am super close to) for the rest of my time in college. Anyways...

The same two girls that we were supposed to live with this year, messaged me the other day and asked if I would want to rent a house with them off campus next year, along with another girl (most juniors and seniors rent houses/apartments at my school, so it is a normal thing to ask). But on the other hand, my other friends (a guy, and about three other girls) asked if I would want to live in an off-campus apartment with them next year. I have to let them know by the end of this week since they are leasing it soon.

So here's the dilemma: I do not know if I should rent a house with the girls, or live in an apartment with people I am already friends with (I am only really close with the guy; we are not dating because he is not straight, but he is my best friend on campus). The thing is, the house is right across the street from campus so I can just walk right to class and the rent is fairly cheap, while the apartment buildings (one of which my friends want to live in) are far away, so that means I would have to walk like 20 minutes in a bad neighborhood, or buy myself a car to drive to class everyday and then pay for a parking ticket. The girls who are renting the house already have the house picked out, while my friends do have any plans set in stone... and I also am not sure how or if five people are going to fit into an apartment. And as for the girls who have asked me if I wanted to rent a house with them, I am nervous that they will not like me or that I won't like them/find them to be rude; I get along with everyone I meet, but people have seemed to dislike me in the past and I am nervous that it will happen again. And the fact that I have never met them makes me even more nervous. I do want to find a close group of girl friends though and feel as though this is my chance. I also do not want to hurt my friends' feelings though -- the group of people renting the apartment, because I am really close with the one, and feel as though he'll be really upset if I choose not to live with them.

What would you do? Or what do you think I should do? I just need some advice/guidance lol. I am so lost. Thank you!",13Oct2020,1

6,Just got home from the Rehab center this week. Survived a pretty high fall (roughly 50 ft) on Sept 19 and was rushed to the hospital. Dislocated shoulder and several broken bones. Had a spinal fusion surgery. The doctor said I was lucky to be alive and not to be paralyzed. He said he had three similar cases in his career and only me can walk again. Since I have come home I can't help but  wondering that why I survived the accident. I should have died. But I didn't. Was it just pure luck or there was someone who helped me that day? Who determines death? I know I should just focus on healing...I never thought about those questions before but right now I just can't help but wonder these things.,13Oct2020,1

9,"we were best friends for like a year, we had met that same year and were so close so fast. we connected and she was a funny person to be around, but she was toxic as hell. 

she hated all of my friends and let them know that, she insulted their looks, insulted my looks, wanted me all to herself and would constantly call me names. i recognize how toxic she was and i’m glad that i made the decision to cut her off, but i can’t help but think about the good times we had. 

when she wasn’t being toxic, she was a great person to hang out with, we’d joke around with each other and just have fun. 

i miss those times a lot. although i didn’t tell her the real reason why i stopped talking to her, i told her that it was because of her excessive drug use and how it made me uncomfortable, but even then she made me feel guilty about it and told me that it’s none of my business what she does, and when i remember that that was her reaction to me telling her something that made me uncomfortable, i pat myself on the back for being able to cut her off. just wanted to share that, i don’t know what made me think of her, but i did.",13Oct2020,1
10,"Just seems like it’s way too prevalent.  

Everyone I know is depressed about something, Bunch of sad millennials on reddit.  My gf of 6 years dumped me because she’s severely depressed that she’s not 18 anymore. 

I’m very weirdly nostalgic so all I do almost every day is dwell on my past. If I see a YouTube comment from like 10 years ago I’ll get nostalgic for like an hour just thinking about my life ten years ago and how much I miss it. 

Me and my high school friend are 25 now and we still reminisce from time to time about the obsessions with certain girls we had in high school. We gossip about them too like they’re still relevant. “OMG bro did you see Hannah’s IG post she has a kid now.” 

Hannah is living her own life she probably hasn’t thought about either of us since she was in a classroom with us 8 years ago and we don’t even talk to her.   

I was best friends with this girl when I was 12-16 then she cut me out of her life. From 16-25, I haven’t been anywhere near as happy as I was in that friendship. That’s pretty sad to me, no? Grown assss dude missing his former 13 year old self’s friendship. 

Told my older sister(29) I’m in therapy like a month ago and then she told me about how she took therapy and the anti depressants they put her on gave her panic attacks. I had no clue she was depressed. No clue she was in therapy. But there’s another person who’s depressed. She was a very happy person growing up and even in her early 20s. 

I’m just trying to figure out wtf is going on. Was depression always this prevalent? Is it just the norm for people in their mid 20s to be depressed because they’re still transitioning from kid to adult? 

In 20 years Will depression be this widespread amongst the next batch of 20 year olds? 

Or is life just inherently shittier now?",13Oct2020,1
11,"The last phone I bought didn't have a certain warning on it:

That link describes it. I'm super concerned now because this latest TracFone (my first Trac) has the ""Cancer"" label on it. I've known before from Physics class in high school that cell phone signal radiation (WiFi and Data) is hazardous over long periods of exposure. The thing is, I didn't have a smart phone until 10th grade. I didn't care when I learned about that beforehand. Now I'm afraid I'm doomed for cancer because my younger generation is reliant on them.

A bit less concerningly, only two types of cancer have been known to be caused from the radiation (as per [this article](https://www.mskcc.org/news/do-cell-phones-cause)), and were only conceived from rats - therefore not a clear indicator of what might happen to humans.

Said person has always kept a firm grip on my finances. I am currently unable to work, so if I left I’d be out on the street with nothing. And my abuser has always made it clear that if I tried to evict them I’d fail and I’d regret it.

However, they have never looked after themselves and are now old and in poor health, so hopefully I’ll be able to start living my own life soon. And when I do, I will blossom!

 **TRIGGER WARNING:** death, murder, sexual assault mention, grief

Her name was Ruth George. She was 19. She had a perfect smile, glossy long black hair, and flawless skin. She was so smart, kind, and was one of the funniest people I knew. Had flawless grades, did clubs, a bright and successful woman. One of those girls who you could never forget, stood out in a crowd, didn’t have bad blood with anyone I could remember. We both lost our fathers when we were young, played piano, did gymnastics, were the same age, and shared ethnicity. We were both going to be doctors. We had a bond unlike the majority of my relationships because we shared such similar experiences and interests. 

She was going home from a social event for her medical fraternity at her college last fall. She got out of an uber with her friends and they parted ways. She was only walking a few blocks to her car. It was on her school campus. She was cat-called by a man on the walk home. She ignored him, the way they always tell us girls to. He followed her, all the way to the parking garage her car was in. Across from the student center. She was about to get into her car, when he came up from behind her and strangled her. Then he assaulted her. and then he left her there in the back seat of her car with the doors open. in the cold of a Chicago winter. 

She was found the next morning by police and her family, declared deceased. I got a call at 5 am from a friend who went to her school telling me “Ruth was found dead in her car.” That was all the information I had. I woke up my mom hysterically sobbing, repeating over and over again that she was dead, and that someone killed her. My mom tried to comfort me, saying it could’ve been alcohol poisoning, an accident, that it could’ve been anything and not as horrible as I was imagining. But I knew something was wrong. I knew Ruth. She was like me. Smart, knew her boundaries, she wouldn’t get in a car drunk, she wouldn’t have left her friends if she wasn’t feeling well. And I found out the details of what happened on the news later that day. 

I then went to her wake a week later. Looked through the photos displayed of her. It still didn’t feel real until I saw her. It was open casket. I wanted to grab her and shake her awake. She looked so peaceful for someone who’s passing was so violent. I saw her mother cry, after having lost her husband and now her youngest. She didn’t even recognize me, her eyes were so full of tears. It reminded me of when I cried at my fathers funeral when I was 11 years old. I had to leave before the procession was done. It was too much for me. 

The following months her laugh played on repeat in my head, carving into my thoughts like a razor blade. And I kept thinking about how 2 weeks before, she told me she would visit me next semester, how she wanted to party with me but was scared she might “die” from partying too hard. 

And I said “Don't worry I’ll keep you safe”

But I didn’t that night.

I know I couldn’t have known, I know she was 2.5 hours away from me, I know it wasn’t even relatively my fault, but even now I still ask myself what if I just called her that night, texted her, anything. Would things have changed? Would she still be here? As a woman I know how dangerous the world is for girls, I know the answer is probably not, I just wish it wasn’t like that. I wish I could’ve saved her. I wish it never happened to begin with. I wish she could’ve walked to her car and gone home in peace. I wish every woman could.

And as death often does, her death greatly impacted my life. I have experienced death often in my life. With my father dying at a young age, a few friends to accidents, suicide, health conditions, etc. But I had never experienced grief over a life being taken away by someone else. I remember watching the news and seeing the convicted man’s face and feeling this anger bubble up inside of me, the hatred that I had for men who’s eyes looked at the bodies of women passing by, I remember one time hearing a man catcall me on a walk home and gripping my fists so hard in anger my nails nearly cut into my palms. And the fear, the way I obsessively look over my shoulder whenever I walk anywhere alone, the way I call my roommates and check their locations every time they come home a little late from class. And the publicity. The publicity was so difficult to handle. I was followed on social media by strangers after my picture with her was used in the news and i have a quote on her. I cant even imagine how hard it must’ve been for her family in that regard. 

I began coping by going through the comments on news articles about her and unleashing my anger on anyone who said anything negative, I would stalk sexist posts blaming women or their clothes for sexual assault and comment paragraphs of anger, I would reread our conversations and look at old photos over and over again. I drank more than ever before. It was hell. and I knew this wasn’t healthy, I knew Ruth would be disappointed in my negativity. I felt guilty and stupid but I needed to get that anger out of me. **And I hope anybody who is struggling with this anger or may be coping the same knows this is normal, and there is no shame in being hurt, and to let it out. It’s okay to be angry.** 

And I fell into depression, had to drop classes and let my grades fall. I felt like nothing mattered. I didn’t cry over Ruth, I didn’t care if I was failing classes, I didn’t even bother to call my mom for 6 months. I felt numb, like I felt nothing and everything at the same time. And I am so grateful to have patient friends, family, and professors. My friends encouraged me to email my professors which was very difficult. In fact, emailing my professors was humiliating and terrifying for me, a girl who always did well in school. But when I finally sent out emails explaining my situation, the empathy displayed by my teachers was incredible and helped me more than they will ever know. **I hope if you’re struggling with grief you know that it is okay to ask for help, you need time to heal. Honesty is your friend and you are not weak or a burden for needing help. I know it’s hard to ask for, but support from the people around you will help you heal faster and stronger.** 

Grief can be so difficult and is different for every person and every circumstance. Again as a person who has lost many loved ones, I thought my experience with death would make me bounce back faster from grief, but it didn’t. And that’s okay. **This is normal. You are not weak for struggling to handle grief, even if you have experienced death before. And you are not heartless for not struggling much either. We all grieve differently.** 

In regards to healing, we all heal differently as well. But oh my god, as someone who grew up in a household where crying was looked down upon, I have to say crying was one of the most cathartic and healing things for me throughout this time. **It’s okay not to cry too.** But I know plenty of people are in my situation, and **I want to really emphasize that it is okay to cry. It can be embarrassing, awkward, taxing, but it is okay to cry.** One of my favorite quotes about crying when grieving is from a podcast, The Midnight Gospel in which the Host asks his mother, who has stage 4 metastatic breast cancer, **“There's no way to stop the heartbreak. What do you do about that?” and she simply replies “You cry! You cry.”** 

Another thing about healing I’d like to talk about is forgiveness. I think a lot of people believe you have to forgive people who have hurt you to move on. And honestly? You don’t. It can be so hard to be the “bigger person”, whatever that means, when it comes to healing from the pain that comes from grief. Some people find it necessary to forgive to heal, but you aren’t a bad person for struggling with or simply not wanting to forgive someone. I think forgiveness is a great way of letting go of negativity, but there are other ways of doing that and it’s not necessary to forgive. I would like to forgive Ruth’s murderer someday, but I haven’t yet. I don’t wish him ill will, I just don’t feel I have let go of my resentment yet and I’m not sure if I ever will. **Forgiveness is graceful and strong. I think it’s a beautiful thing but again, you are not a bad person for not forgiving someone or something that hurt you.**

Looking back now about a year later, I still don’t think I’ve fully healed. I still find myself thinking of her nearly every day. Sometimes the thoughts are positive and sometimes they’re negative. Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry. But I believe I am the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. This experience with grief made me so much more patient, with myself and others. I became less judgmental, more empathetic, and more motivated than ever to become a person(and the doctor) that Ruth would be proud of. I grew. And I’m proud of myself too. I hope everyone else who is struggling gets to this point too. **Stay hopeful. It isn’t easy, I know, but things will be better someday. You will be okay.**

**And as for the safety of women as a whole, I wish I could hold every little girl’s hand in the world and protect them from the evils of sexism and predators their whole life until they’re old and grey. I wish I could take away all the pain from every woman who has been a victim and every person who has been hurt by violence and cruelty to women. And I’m sorry I can’t. I’m sorry this world is the way that it is. I’m sorry if the painful experiences of you or your loved ones went unheard. But I hope you know your stories matter. Stories like Ruth’s need to be told. I cant tell you how happy I felt to see people sharing #Rememberruth, sharing their feelings and experiences, and awareness being brought to the topic through the #metoo movement and so much more. Ruth would be so proud to know how many people she impacted, how many women she empowered, how much awareness she brought. I wish she were still here, but I want to thank everyone who made sure she will be remembered. I hope someday the daughters of our future generation will be able to walk at night without fear. On that day I will finally feel at peace.** 

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read about my experience. I hope if you’re at the end of this you gained something. Please feel free to share in the comments or my inbox your experiences, knowledge, pain, I am listening. 

Lot's of love,

Ruby",13Oct2020,1

26,"Someone may find this interesting...or not...but it's 100% true.  I have a good friend who mostly likes Trump, despite acknowledging that he acts like a fool.  He's conservative, his family has always voted Republican.  He basically thinks all politicians are crooks and liars, but Trump is worse at hiding it.  He's not as open minded as I am (shocker).  While I'd never be friends with someone who I felt was truly hateful, he has made comments/jokes in the past about immigrants, minorities, gays etc. (we are both white).  He teases me for being a liberal and he hates how PC everything his.  I always told him how I love everyone, have no problem with anyone, he knows this, we don't go into heavy debates about this sort of thing.

Anyway back to the point, this friend of mine basically lives for family vacations.  And who can blame him, but he is really into it.  Of course like everyone else his original summer plans were dashed due to COVID, and he's still furious about the whole thing.  For a while he was on the ""this is nonsense, this is overblown"" type deal, it was all going to disappear soon, etc. etc.  Now his Christmas plans are cancelled as well.  The last straw for him was Trump catching COVID and his reaction so far, basically downplaying it and calling it a blessing.  My friend has finally realized that this administration is not capable of controlling COVID and therefore his plans for NEXT summer could be in jeopardy.  This was all it took, now he is voting for Biden, even though he absolutely despises him and his entire platform.",13Oct2020,1
27,"Hi. I need to just say this into the world because I’m burning out. In a nutshell, I am working as an advocate for child window safety, specifically with a non profit and geared toward privatized military housing. It’s been grueling. It’s been scary, rewarding, exhausting and exhilarating. My son fell fifteen feet from our military housing window and luckily survived albeit with TBI and long term issues. Then my neighbor’s son fell two months later. So I decided I had to do something about it once and for all. I’m literally white knuckling through every day praying another kid doesn’t fall out until I complete my mission.

29,"I've been following this company since I graduated from college 2 years ago. Last year, I got in contact with them because they were working directly with another company I was freelancing for. I also discovered someone I knew worked there who passed my resume over.

I interviewed and they seemed to really like me. One of the directors even gave me a tour of the building and introduced me to some more employees. Unfortunately, I got a call later that even though they liked me a lot I just wasn't strong enough of a candidate. I was kind of devastated but grateful for the opportunity still. 

Regardless, I've continued to better myself and my skills on my own and have even taken on more responsibilities in the freelance positions I've had during covid. I recently saw that the company I interviewed at opened up a new position similar to the one I interviewed for so I just schedule-sent an email to their hiring manager (I still had her email) for tomorrow morning.

I really really hope they're willing to interview me and even more hopefully offer me the position. Even though I've been doing a lot and making progress even during the pandemic I've never had a permanent position since I graduated. I've only been full-time freelancing on long projects. 

I've also been feeling really discouraged about myself lately. My family life isn't that great and about two months ago my mom told me she gave up on me and didn't care about me anymore because I haven't landed a permanent position. She nags me every day that I ""don't have a job"" even though I do and I've been working really hard. I hope I get this position and can move out. I wanna move forward in my life and start to feel better. I want to feel proud of myself even though it seems no-one else is.

31,"I am an admissions coordinator for an eating disorder treatment program. 
I answer phone calls nationwide for people who are struggling with an eating disorder. 

Overtime, your clients start to grow onto you because you are their main point of contact to receive treatment. 

It can be tough sometimes because denial is a big consequence of an eating disorder and it can be frustrating to explain the severity. Eating disorder has the highest death rate for any psychiatric illness, specifically anorexia. So there’s urgency to get clients into treatment before they change their mind (and they often do.)

I just logged into a program that has information for patients who are currently admitted in treatment. It was my first time using this internal program, as I often just work with the beginning process of admitting and not after admitting. And I came across some patients profiles that I helped officially admit to our program. A lot of them smiled for their profile picture. 

It’s one thing to feel a connection with the family over the phone throughout the whole process. You talk about their struggles, their fears, their desperation, and their anger. You listen to them cry and yell and plead. 
Now, I actually have a face for that patient. 
Idk, it brought tears to my eyes. I know these are actually people when I talk to them on the phone but wow, it brings a whole new emotion when you see their face. My first thought was “oh my god, this is THEM.”

Really made me feel good about what I do because I’m helping real people with really scary disorders. And I helped get them started on recovery.",13Oct2020,1

It left a hole in my heart but I do have great memories that will last me a lifetime. So I say to all who lost someone dear to your heart, remember all of the great times and memories that you have shared with that loved one. No, we can’t get them back although we would love that, just knowing that they will live on in our hearts forever can serve us just a little comfort.

That being said, there is most definitely something wrong with me. I have zero idea what it may be, but I know that my behaviors are not ""normal"" or healthy for that matter. Because I am not in a position in which I can be diagnosed, I've been looking into some conditions myself. I am *not* self-diagnosing, I'm only looking for a group of people I can somewhat relate to, and advice from said group of people.

But the more that I look, the more I feel like nothing online matches what I go through. Everything is bits and pieces.

38,"Projection is one of the commonest psychic phenomena…. Everything that is unconscious in ourselves we discover in our neighbor, and we treat him accordingly.-Carl Jung

If you scapegoat a group by assuming qualities in them when they are no worse than any other group, has not harmed you and has no more power than another group, then you are either vile and know exactly what you're doing, or you have the same qualities, most similar particularly if you are vehement and beat up others about it.

This is what I say towards people who single out China and India, while knowing that Saudi is funded by the US. They know they are easy game and go after them.

Thus, very frequently, the loudest voices accusing others of racism, antisemitism, prejudice, child abuse or human trafficking are themselves the most personally flawed in exactly the ways they accuse others of being. The people who take an ambiguous comment or something a little out of place, start appealing to emotion, and vidinctively tear them apart in the most disingenuous way, are the ones with the crap qualities. China has done nothing to the US in years, yet the US singles them out. Countries who have been treated much worse are less vehement about China.",13Oct2020,1

And then my license finally came. I study at different state than I live, so I rented a small street car.

54," 

I’ve always known that I didn’t have freedom, probably because of where I come from. Even though the place claimed to be democratic, it is only used as a camouflage, it really is a caste military system. Since yesterday, I’ve never felt more afraid? anxious? and I just wish to die from covid rather than from someone else’s bullet. I also had another realization that the world is silent, I wish we had some money or worth to attract the world’s attention. 

There’s been a protest in my country for more than a week now, the young people are protesting against an anti-robbery security force called sars who not only extort but also murder them and conveniently gets away with it. The government quickly tried to dispel the protest by claiming that sars has been dissolved but they’ve been saying this for more than four years now. But security men have shot more than 10 people dead and more have been injured since the protest. I couldn’t bear to watch the videos on twitter but I saw the lifeless bodies with blood around them and these security men showing no remorse or concern - I can’t get it out of my head. Well, the announcement deceived the world news and everyone ...moved on, which is a good thing for the government. Oh, and the local press is either ignoring it or giving false information so yeah, the government has it under control. It’s an open truth that the laws in this country are only for the rich, but I’ve never felt more worthless at the moment. Are all the things I was taught about the rule of law growing up a lie? Maybe I should just believe it all to be a lie and accept that I’m worthless and not equivalent to a human being and expect to be shot one day on the streets. I understand everyone is going through a lot atm and no one is expected to care unless it’s your country, but I just…maybe first world countries had investments in my country, we would have their attention? And I feel like if nothing happens which is very likely thing would get really bad and I’m just scared.

So I had my phone charging off of that while using the flashlight on it to point around the room to look for my real flashlight.

Well lo and behold, there was a scorpion chilling on the towel. Naturally, I couldn’t see the little dude. I didn’t mean to crush him but I guess I was I little too aggressive with my towel wielding. What’s a tiny boy to do when he’s getting tussled, but stab at the ulnar artery of the master hand that’s trashing his temporary domicile? I can sympathize with the small boy, but that harsh of a reprimanding does seem a bit steep for such a minor infraction on my part. It was an honest mistake.

The power didn’t come back on until 12:30 so I was left no choice but to suffer in darkness for the first hour.

I was born in 1988, and have seen the rise of the internet and social media, and witnessed the dissemination of these powerful technologies into the hands of billions of people. In my lifetime, I have travelled farther than probably 95% (a very rough estimate) of all humans that have ever lived. And I have seen things happen that people in the past could have never even dreamed of. (3D Printing, Drones, AI for example). Life is moving at breakneck speed.

And all of this taken together can often make  it feel like we are cresting, staring down into an inevitable doom. And it can be scary. But then, I think about how many times in history people have stared off into the unknown, and likely felt the same way. To be uncertain what the future holds, and to be hurtling forward in time, is simply what it means to be human. This perspective helped me realize that we are not actually at the crest of a wave.

and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

Tyler (my older brother) woke me up by yelling at me to clean his cat's litter box. When I was about to do it he yelled and told me I needed to put D (our dog who doesn't get along with cats) outside before I opened his door. So I did. I opened his door and his cat jumped over my foot and ran out into the kitchen. I picked her up as fast as I could and Tyler started slapping me on the back of the head pretty hard while I still had the cat in my right hand. He kept telling me I was gonna kill his cat and that I didn't care about it's life. I put the cat in his room and he didn't close the door and started arguing with me some more. Then he blew up about leaving his door open and blamed it on me saying it's my fault. I picked the cat up because she was running towards my mom's bathroom (which has another unfriendly dog in it) and brought her to Tyler's room. I asked him if he still wanted me to clean out her litter box and he started saying how if he wasn't there to tell me to put D outside that his cat would've been killed. He kept asking ""If I wasn't here, that cat would've been dead. Right? Right!?"" And when I answered yes he got up and chased me to the living room. At this point I was tired of him slapping me around so we fought. We went back and forth in the middle of the living room until he started to bust me up pretty good. I ended up on my back on the couch and he was on top of me, punching me in the base of my head nonstop. He got off of me when I said he won and I was done fighting. He then said ""You ain't done until you're knocked out"" and ""I'm gonna kill you, you threw the first punch"" I replied by saying ""If I have to fight, I still can. And if it comes to it I'll fight for my life"" He spit in my face, got up and walked away and when I said he was a pig he came at me again. He took his boots off and started punching me. While I was trying to get away I ran to my mom's room. He picked up one of his boots and threw it at my lower back really hard. Idk how that affected me but afterwards I felt extremely sick. I stumbled to the bathroom and puked in the toilet. At this point I'm on my knees, crying and throwing up. I was in there for about five minutes before Tyler came in. He said ""You're gonna be fighting for life in a minute because I'm gonna kill you"" This is when he took his shirt off and cornered me in the bathtub and started saying that he's gonna beat me to a bloody pulp and knock all my ""fake ass plastic teeth"" out of my skull. (Referring to my two permanent caps on my bottom row of teeth) I told him I was done fighting and he started talking about how a real fight wouldn't be over until someone's dead. He punched me in my left arm three times. I didn't let it faze me and he said ""Oh so you think you're tough?"" He started talking about how I ""killed his innocent little cat"" (Even though it wasn't dead) I could hear his voice start to quiver. He left again and at this point I'm just trying to end this. I had to put on an act just so he would stop, or at least not hit me as hard. This didn't really work though because he was still hitting me with all his strength. He left and shortly came back into the bathroom and told me he lost his job and that it was all my fault. His exact words were ""I just lost my job and it's all your fault. The cat got out and it's all your fault!"" When he brought up the cat after telling me he got fired I knew he was lying so he could have a justifiable reason for attacking me again. He also said that because I threw the first punch he could put me in the hospital and get away with it (which didn't make sense because he'd go to jail for attacking me as I was just standing my ground). He was yelling at the top of his lungs that he doesn't care about me and wanted to beat the life out of me. He said he was prepared to go to jail and lose his job. Too tired to fight, I stood in the corner of the bathtub and thought about throwing the first punch while he was provoking me so I could have some time to get out of the house. I didn't do it because we were in a small space and I don't think I could've made it. There was nothing I could do. He punched me once in my right thigh and once in my right arm and spit in my face. He said some other things I don't recall because my adrenaline was starting to settle and I was focusing on the pain I was feeling. He walked out and I stood in that corner of the bathtub for another seven minutes before I heard that the house was silent. I slowly opened the bathroom door and grabbed my charger from the living room to charge my phone. I was originally going to text my mom about it but decided to wait to tell her in person. So I layed down in my mom's bed while my phone charged. I tried hiding it under the towel I used to clean the spit off of my face. He came in the room and said ""You are NOT to go in my room near that cat! Do you understand?!"" I had to say yes. When I did he called me a bitch and swung his keys at my foot but I dodged it. He walked outside and left in his car to his job. I can't deny, I was scared. Not as scared as I was letting him believe, but enough to genuinely fear for my safety.

Then she does it again. So my mom is looking all around making sure she doesn't hit anyone else while she's swerving out of the way and we see the lady slam her brakes in front of us again.

This year I have gotten my permit driving licenses. I was very excited to drive and everything until my dad started teaching me. Background story: my dad and I are not close at all. I don’t feel comfortable enough around him to even ask him any questions or talk to him. I feel kind of alarmed when he’s there and I’m cautious of anything that I do. We have never had a good relationship ever since I was little so most of the time I would just try to avoid him. Back to the story: my dad is the one who have to teach me to drive because he is the only one in my family that knows how to. I have never in my life felt this type of stress and frustration at anything like this before. It is very frustrating dealing with the way he talks to me and yells at me while I’m just trying to learn to drive. All he does is criticize me even when I’m doing well better than before. I do tell him that I’m still a new driver and I’m still trying to learn and that did not help the situation. I try to muster up my courage and ask him questions to make sure if what I was doing is right or should I take this lane and the way he would answer me is as if I should already know what I’m doing. He treats me like I should already know what I should be doing when I have no clue what I should do. One time, I felt so frustrated and stressed to the point where I suddenly stopped the car in the middle of the street on accident. Ever since then, I’ve been traumatized to even sit this close to him and having to deal with the emotions that I felt with him yelling at me and talking to me with an attitude and belittling me. This is truly mentally draining me, just the thought of it makes me stress out. I have been taking a break from driving but he been telling me that he needs to teach me how to drive before my permit expires even though I only got it few months ago so it’ll expire after few years. I want to say no, I don’t want to drive anymore but I know that once I say no, I will never be able to drive again after that. What’s worse is that he already bought me a car to practice driving with so this is putting a lot of pressure on me despite wanting to take a break from all of this or just quit driving.

103,"2 years ago, ocd was telling me that I may have made and broken a rushed ocd promise to God. I think, I read somewhere perhaps, about being able to change the promise to something else for greater good. I am not sure. Perhaps, due to the sadness because of the hypothesis of making and breaking an ocd promise to God, I asked for the promise not to count by changing it to never smoke again. I  do not remember if it was just, a random thought or if I prayed for that. I think the chances of praying to change the promise are low because I think, I would not dare in that period to make a promise to God. For some reason, sometimes, whenever I think about smoking, I get some thoughts that connect smoking with the new promise that negates the ocd promise. I do not know why my subconscious makes that connection. Perhaps, the idea of changing the ocd promise to no smoking popped up in my mind, 2 years ago, but I rejected it. I cant remember praying for it.  I worry because I cant remember. What if I made a real promise to God because of the hypothetical ocd promise that probably, never counted?  I worry because 1,5 year ago, I smoked. Is the promise broken? If the ocd promise that probably, never counted was the reason for making a new promise, does it mean that the new promise is still part of ocd which means that it is not valid?",13Oct2020,1

107,"When you're afraid of killing yourself, so you call the hotline, I would say that person has enough hope, enough desire to live to try to keep their life, when they are afraid that they will hurt themselves. But the most dangerous place you can be is when you've made up your mind. No hotline needed. You're not afraid, because you are the one making the decision. And that desire sits like a seed in you, not making a sound, not reaching out for help, until it is fully grown.

What could be worse than leaving behind people who love you out of sadness? I think the answer to that would be living in hatred. Hatred of yourself, of what you did, or how you see the world. Hatred is worse than sadness, because sadness can be soothed. It can be coddled. But to hate yourself is worse. You're unable to escape who you are. What you did. How others see you. So the only way for some is suicide.

I dont think that enough people know just how dark or tragic suicide is, even the people on the hotline. When I call for help, please dont ask me any questions. To save my life, simply listen. To those who know a depressed person, you can help by seeing them as human beings. Dont judge by how much they cry, or dont cry. Pain can be internalized. Happiness can be faked. In truth, people kill themselves out of nowhere. Because when they've made the decision to, there is no more need for a hotline.

My cousin killed himself. He shot himself in the head with his dad's shotgun. And I miss him. And my mom died last month. I miss her. All my life I heard about a wonderful grandmother I never knew, who died before i was born. All m life i wanted her. I miss my grandfather, who died a few years ago, who was a cold man, who never thought anyone would care about him in the end. I want to be dead, and the only reason I'm still here is because I havent decided yet. But I've called the hotline enough times. I dont want to call anymore. They dont help long term. And it's an honest opinion, just one person's opinion. I say this in Hope's you won't remove my opinion out of fear. What we need is honesty.

Life has lost its enjoyment for me. With my brother constantly arguing with me, projecting problems he had with our mom onto me, I feel unable to bear the weight of it. Two weeks ago, a few people in my family completely turned against me. That was most of my support system. It just fell through. And they dont know how much it hurt me, how I cried uncontrollably for hours afterward. And I still love them. But that incident has made me extremely self-doubting, and I want that all to end.

Talking about this has helped get some of the negativity off, but I still feel a lot of it. I'm not looking for accolades or any consolation. Just don't report or take down my post. I desperately want to be heard. I want people to know the truth, or at least my truth. I dont like living in a world where truth is stifled for the sake of feelings. My feelings matter too. My truth matters too. I want to plead with you to stop silencing people.l for the sake of your truth. Its just as hurtful. Even moreso.",13Oct2020,1

132,"Hi Reddit, had an experience a few years ago while out with a friend that I’ve always had questions about. I hardly ever drink much less get drunk, and have never done drugs, and am hoping to gain some clarity about what happened on this particular night for two reasons – so that I can help myself ensure it doesn’t happen again, and so I know what really happened between me and the guy I was hanging out with that I considered a friend. Not because I would ever do anything about it or bring it up to anybody, but because I just think about it every time I go out and just want to know why I got as bad as I did that night. 

I had just turned 21 and had never been to a club before, and not even many bars. I was living in Boston and got an invite from an older man who I worked with and was attracted to, to go out for drinks. I had never hung around him outside of work, so I brought along my friend and we ended up going to a concert at around 10pm. To avoid confusion, I’ll just call him “the man” and my other female friend “my friend”.) I was nervous beforehand, and probably didn’t eat as much as I normally would, but we did go out to a restaurant several hours before (where I ate pasta and had a cocktail), and a hard boiled egg and some grapes just before we left to go out. I should also mention I am small (about 5’1 and 110) and at the time was taking only a small (maybe 10mg) dosage of Lexapro every night. I hadn’t taken it yet on the day we went out. 

At the concert, I remember clearly having two cocktails over the space of an hour/ 1.5 hours (vodka, I think, and some kind of pear juice or something like that). Afterward, before we left the concert, I was feeling slightly buzzed and chilled out, but nowhere near drunk or even tipsy. The man we were with came over and gave us directions to the next place, a bar, and I was able to get myself and my friend there easily using a subway. I think the buzz was already started to wear off when we got to the bar. Once I got there, the man asked me what I wanted and then came back with a  vodka tonics for my friend and me. They were maybe 7 inches tall, in a slim glass, and I was so thirsty and getting nervous again, so I drank it quite quickly. Within minutes, I started to go numb. I couldn’t feel my face, and when I leaned forward to put the glass on the table, it literally fell out of my hand and I had trouble picking it back up. My friend, who is not much bigger than me, was hit by the drink in the exact same way, and next thing I knew, we were struggling to the bathroom together, telling each other how out of control we felt and how scared we were. I remember someone actually had to communicate with us through the bathroom door to help us open the door again and get out. I also remember talking to another girl and trying so hard to come off normal but feeling terrified by how I felt.

At that point, I have a vague memory of the man parading us down the street as we all headed to our next stop, a night club. At this point, I wouldn’t have a single sip of anything else for the rest of the night. I was so far gone that my friend recalls me trying to talk to her, acting as if I knew exactly what I was saying, but I was, as she put it, “just saying sounds.” If I remember, to me, what I was saying made total sense to me. I vaguely remember that the man was dirty dancing with me over the next few hours, but I hardly remember any details. It was like I was fading in and out: like I’d emerge from nothingness to find myself being spun around in the air, then go back into nothingness. At one point, my friend and I both had to use the bathroom so bad that we could hardly wait in the line, but in our minds, we did. Next thing you we knew a guy was yelling at us that we can’t cut in line, and are we okay? I remember my friend and I looking at each other like, we cut in line? Really? I genuinely believed I had been waiting right there the whole time. 

When we finally got into the bathroom, I must have lapsed in memory again, because I do not remember at all how long I was in the stall, etc. But apparently my friend and I were in there for so long that the man sent one of his other female friends in to get us out of there and see if we were okay. 

The entire night, I went from being obviously unaware and out of it to being deeply scared and worried about not being safe in the situation. This was weird to me, because when you are that drunk, aren’t you supposed to not have the capacity to be scared? Maybe I’m wrong, but that’s just what I always thought. It was like if I wasn’t completely blacked out in my mind, I was in a state of terror.

At one point, I remember saying to my friend that I wanted to call someone to get us out of the club, because I didn’t trust myself to stay any longer for fear of being taken advantage of or not being able to get home, but when I pulled out my phone, I had near complete double vision. There was no way I could even begin to find my messages to text or contacts to call. So I just waited it out, still lapsing in and out. We didn’t leave until around 5am, at which point the man made a comment like “you’re not going all the way back to your dorm, are you?” In hindsight, I believe this was an invitation to go home with him, as he lives in the middle of the city and I was a bit out of the way. Thankfully, I was able to get a cab and tell them the right address, because otherwise, I feel like I would have just gone with him. 

When I finally got back home about 25 minutes later, it had been about 5-6 hours, maybe a bit more, since I had had anything to drink, but I was still feeling pretty drunk. I remember I realized in the cab that somewhere along the way, I lost my wallet, and I just broke down crying at what a mess the night had turned into. I was SO embarrassed that the one and only time I had gotten so messed up was with an older, attractive guy who I looked up to, and the fact that I now lost my wallet and all it’s contents was just the breaking point. Once I got back to my dorm, my roommate told me that I had to call and cancel my debit card in case it was stolen, and I remember typing in a long number, confident it was the right one until my phone read it back to me and I realized I had typed absolute nonsense. I was too upset to sleep, so I was awake when I finally started to sober up maybe an hour later. The strange thing was that when I got up and had to go to class early the next morning, at around 9 am, I didn’t feel like I was “hungover” at all, just upset at myself for what had happened the night before. And I have a very sensitive stomach, but I experienced no nausea throughout any of this – not while I was intoxicated, or the day after. 

I did stay in touch with this man sporadically afterward, but we didn’t see each other in person again until this year – a full two years after the last time. Immediately, he made it clear he wanted to go out and get drunk again, and I went. I really don’t want to believe he drugged me and my friend, especially since there are quite a few factors against me that could explain how trashed I was. Oddly, as we sat at the bar that second time, he brought up how messed up my friend and I were the last time, and straight up asked if we thought we were rufied. My immediate thought was, if he did it, why would he just throw it out there like that, but at the same time, he was the one who got our drinks from the bar and brought them straight to us – at what point would someone else have had the opportunity to spike them? We aren’t in touch anymore, btw.


I hope that gives enough info that you guys can give your thoughts on what you think happened here. Again, not looking to nail anyone, but it’s one of those things that comes to mind from time to time, and I just wish I knew for sure how to explain it to myself. It actually gave me a fear of alcohol for awhile afterward – I would get knots in my stomach at the thought of going out or even having drinks at my place with friends. That eventually subsided, but because of this night, I still have no idea what my limits truly are.

Thanks in advance for any information. Hope you all are hanging in there!",13Oct2020,1
133,"If someone is very upset with himself, hates himself, believes himself to have acted worse/been worse than everybody else, thinks he is at fault for everything including his own suffering, he is often accused of “having a pity party.” 

Of course he isn’t at that exact moment doing anything to improve himself, so I guess you could say he is wallowing, but often this kind of person does try very hard to be better it’s just that he never thinks he is trying hard enough or doing good enough and so gets intensely angry with himself for his many failings.

I feel like a lot of depressed people, people with low self esteem are like this. But on the Internet, and elsewhere, depressed people and people with low self esteem are frequently accused of indulging in self-pity, of complaining, of being ungrateful and of wallowing. Often though, this is the exact kind of thing they are they are saying to themselves and a big part of the reason they are so angry with themselves. 

Am I missing something? Is hating yourself, being prone to shame spirals (rather than projecting blame outward) so very similar to self-pity? Is an overly apologetic remark or moment of self-blame akin, in most people’s eyes, to a complaint?",13Oct2020,1

137,"Hi. Do you guys think relationships and friendships are overrated. Like, you owe them your time and you constantly feel the need to explain yourself. When you're alone, you have nothing to lose. No obligations, no need to fit in or pretend to care about what they have to say. Dont have to worry about losing a partner you don't have. Dress up and look nice for yourself not to attract a romantic  partner. Sure, it's nice to have someone to share a bed with or help you out financially, don't get me wrong. But you have to understand their needs and conditions (unconditional love is a childish lie). If you want to get laid, buy a sex toy or have a friend with benefit. You don't have to worry about explaining yourself to anyone or emotional baggage. I would have posted it in r/forever alone because they overlook the blessing of being alone. Oh and it's less expensive than getting married and having kids. You can drink and spend as much money as you like. At the end of the day, its up to you. Ultimate freedom.

Sure wish I had realized this 5 years ago. But there's still time to enjoy myself.",13Oct2020,1
