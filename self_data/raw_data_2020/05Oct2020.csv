1,"Most people at night think about their day, their stress, their family, sex, work, or memes.

I am not most people.

I am the weirdo who lay awake thinking about black mould. How it came to be like that. If it's fatal. It it feels furry like other mould or if it feels different. What it tastes like (I do not want to taste it btw - it was mere curiosity). How it came to be. Whether there was whit mould. If it could mix with white mould. If it could mix with any other colour mould.

Curiosity got the better of me and I looked up what it looked like. I don't know why, but I imagined smelling and licking it. It was strangely gross but the mould looked so seductive. Because it was bad for me and I wanted to... rebel?

I eventually fell asleep but not before thinking what a fucking lunatic I must be if I think about black mould at night. And licking it.",05Oct2020,1

My(22F) friend Caroline(29F) has always been very overweight. I‚Äôve never shamed her for it and always offer to go hiking or biking on her days off. I‚Äôm almost under eight. I‚Äôm vegan, but I would never push my diet on anyone else. I‚Äôm also very body positive and feel it‚Äôs never my place to comment on someone‚Äôs body or health. I feel like I am a supportive friend and not dismissive of my friends weight issues. I eat healthy most days, but once every couple of days, I eat out or have a dessert to treat myself. Caroline acts like I can eat whatever I want because of my size, or unhealthy with her sometimes, but I work out almost every day. Caroline tries to start diets but usually breaks them. This has been going on for years.

The other day I asked her to hang out and maybe get food or something. She gets furious at me and says she's done getting fast food and told me this multiple times. She acts like I‚Äôm pressuring her and trying to sabotage her diet. I try to explain when I said to get food, I also mean healthy stuff like smoothies or going to a salad place, and I have suggested places like that before, and I don't only eat fast food. She goes on this long rant about eating out is a waste of money and she‚Äôs aware of what I‚Äôm saying and that she‚Äôs said multiple times that (even though she never makes it completely clear). Like two days earlier, she had gone out to eat at a ‚Äùhealthy‚Äù restaurant.

I just feel like she‚Äôs a hypocrite and taking her frustration out on me. Most things are closed so besides hiking and getting takeout there‚Äôs not much to do. I don‚Äôt know if I was being rude but like I said when I suggest getting food it could even be going to trader joes and getting fruit or something. I don‚Äôt understand why Caroline is getting so mad at me lately now she‚Äôs ignoring me. Am I being rude for asking my friend out to eat?",05Oct2020,1

I know I have a problem for months and I keep on looking at self help videos on YouTube and again I just completely ignore any advice I get and continue living a shitty life.
I feel like any sort of challenge I get to improve myself I just ignore it and resort back to my confront zone. I feel like I‚Äôve caused so much damaged to my mind and to my body that If I don‚Äôt do anything I‚Äôm just gonna be living like this for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt know what to do I feel so lost and ashamed. I don‚Äôt know where this began, how did I let myself become like this. I just wanna go back in time and start over.

Its been A year and now I've began something new and in its early stages with another girl. It's weird to get the ""I cant wait to talk to you tomorrow"" and ""good night!"" posts from this new girl, its like this was something I was doing with my past relationship. It just feels so weird these same things are now being said by a different person now and I am reciprocating.

I'm trying to take it slow because just seeing how much she likes me makes me nervous, I do really like her, but at the same time it definitely feels weird hearing those words from another girl. It gets me anxious and a bit afraid another person in my life likes me that much.",05Oct2020,1
9,"Hi all. A few months ago I voiced my insecurities to my boyfriend of 2 years, how social media and particularly tiktok made me feel so bad about myself. He tried to be supportive and offered to delete any videos he had saved of girls on tiktok. I never asked him to do this and never expected him to. After all he‚Äôs allowed to be attracted to other girls. Later that night he said ‚ÄúI deleted all my tiktok girls for you, here check!‚Äù 

A few nights later I found out (by accident) that he has a second tiktok account dedicated to following girls. He would send all the videos from his main account to this second account. I confronted him because I was hurt that he told me he deleted any girls he had saved but in reality he just had deleted the ones off his main account. He replied that he hadn‚Äôt lied because all the ones off his main account were gone and basically said it wasn‚Äôt his fault I was insecure.

Ever since that moment I have felt so much more small and insecure. He logged out of the account but he didn‚Äôt delete it so he probably still goes on it. I know I sound so ridiculous and pathetic but it hurts my feelings so much when he saves videos, which he still does. The other night he got drunk and while we were watching tiktok tgth scrolled past every video unless it was a girl, he then would stop and swipe to their profile and watch a few more of their videos. 

I know that my boyfriend is allowed to be attracted to other people. I know that he is with me. I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to compare. Especially if he is willing to lie to me when he knows it‚Äôs such a sensitive topic in order to continue looking at these girls. My main love language is words of affirmation. My boyfriend finds voicing that sort of thing very difficult. He never really gives me any sort of verbal reassurance. I know he loves me but god I feel so ugly and insufficient. I just want to be enough. I want him to look at me like he looks at them.

I just thought that I‚Äôd add that I have never saved any guys/followed any male models etc because I feel that my s/o is enough for me, I‚Äôve never even wanted to.

I don‚Äôt expect any replies, I just want to write this out because I feel pathetic talking to anyone in real life about this.",05Oct2020,1

11,"I was born in 1991 to poor Jewish parents in Cary, North Carolina. My parents were both constantly working, hardly able to spend time with me. The time we did spend together was not quality; they were very distant and seemed to have difficulties forming emotional bonds. It felt like they only cared for me to keep me alive, instead of to perpetuate the existence of an enjoyable human.

When I was 7, my first-grade teacher noticed I was incredibly good in school and was fascinated with geology, biology, and astronomy, and sent me to get a cognitive evaluation, leading to my classification as ""intellectually gifted."" My IQ was 131, and I was told to skip the second, third, fifth, and eleventh grades.

As a result of my youth and reportedly ""dull"" personality, even my friends never wanted to spend time with me. My parents were never around, so I could never tell them about this. My sister, born in 1984, was always out at parties, so I couldn't ask for her advice. I tried talking to my teachers, asking to be placed in a social skills program, and they always just said something along the lines of ""you'll find your clique."" I never did.

I graduated 12th grade in the spring of 2006, and enrolled in college in the autumn of that year, only 15 years old. I applied for degrees in personal finance, microeconomics, and accounting, as I had always enjoyed logic puzzles and mathematics, so accounting felt like a good career. I had one friend in college, but they were 19 when I enrolled and was always busy caring for their grandmother with Alzheimer's (which is understandable), so we could never spend time together. That grandmother died in 2007, and I attended the funeral.

Her death resulted in financial difficulties that forced them to move to Council Bluffs, Iowa, so that was the end of our friendship. Because of my poor social skills, I never made another friend in college. In June of 2010, I graduated with my degree, and the following month was hired at a local financial firm. I worked around the clock, and by March 2011, I had the money to buy a home on my own. (In the interest of my privacy, I won't say where this home is.)

The following month, I went to buy some decorations for my home, and all of a sudden, I completely regressed. I bought Snorlax and Wailord bean bags, Adventure Time posters, teddy bears, Pokemon plushies, hopper balls, a bouncy house, et cetera. I still act like this.

It doesn't interfere with my work-life. I act like a normal adult at work. But once I get home, I change out of my business suit and wear overalls, tutus, lace-up boots, et cetera. I jump around on hopper balls, watch Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and We Bare Bears. I eat candy and sleep with teddy bears. Most of my Saturday afternoons are spent jumping around in my bounce house. I've even found a group of friends to do all of this with.

You could say I'm happy. But why did I make such a dramatic switch from a dull accountant lady to this?",05Oct2020,1
14,"My biggest problem all my life is that looks were everything to me. I only wanted to hangout with people who looked good and were up to date on trends. I only associated with people who have a solid social status which I have some nerve requiring considering I've never been popular myself. I clean up pretty nice but not the hottest thing around. My ego was running the show.

This sounds horrible and it is, unfortunately a lot of people subconsciously believe looks are everything to some extent. I realized this about myself last year when I wondered why I don't have any friends or healthy relationships. Since then I've been working on changing behaviors. I still love fashion and keeping up on trends but it's not a standard for relationships anymore. I'm not selective with who I associate with solely based on looks and status.

I'm currently dating this guy who is different from anyone I've ever dated and most friendships even. This man checks on me, confides in me, calls me, pleasures me, compliments my appearance (even when i dont try) and personality. I've never felt so comfortable to put my guard down and be so honest with someone. If I had remained in my superficial ways I would've never found him.",05Oct2020,1

I finally decided to take online classes from a local community college and I cant help but feel like a disappointment for not getting accepted into a good school... 

Now that I have been taking online classes for a while I have all A‚Äôs except in math. I am trying to get into a good school for computer science but I know the school wont accept me for my major when they see that MATH is my lowest grade. Im studying and asking for help but thats besides the point. Im worried that I wont ever be enough for that school and I want nothing more than to be accepted...I dont know, maybe I need to let go of my hopes of getting in because it could just be a waste of time.

The real questions are what is wrong with me? If im not good at math should I change my major? Should I give up trying to get into that school? Am I as smart as I think I am or am I too confident and actually unintelligent? Please give me some advice. I am desperate, and I have never felt as low as I do now. :(",05Oct2020,1

They said that my heart was fine and was acting normal so they put me on a medication for panic disorder and anxiety a zoloft sertaline. ive been on this drug for awhile and I still have heart palpations. i would suffocate and then my heart would start pumping  again.

So, back then I was 12 and I had an iPhone 4S. I've had it for about 6 months, and before going to sleep the phone was in a perfect condition. I had a dream that my lock screen button wasn't working and guess what - when I woke up, the lock screen button actually didn't work, it's like the button didn't function properly and the clicky sound was just gone. I was shocked with how something like that has happened. 

I remember I told this to my parents and to my friends. No one really seemed to believe me. Parents thought I broke it and the friends just thought that I was joking or I broke it. 

I think that this was something paranormal. I have only experienced one more paranormal occurrence, but that's for another thread.
I'm curious what do you guys think, because, after all these years it still bothers me and I just can't forget that it happened, I just remembered it happened every few months. Thanks.",05Oct2020,1

Many of us have already deleted Facebook and Instagram.

But Reddit isn't any better.

In fact, reddit could be worse. The anonymous nature of reddit makes it a prime target for bots, astroturfing, propaganda and social division. 

Turn Reddit, twitter and Facebook off for a week and the world seems a lot better. That's because the world is actually pretty good - especially here in the developed word. We live in one of the best times in human history. Most people are cordial and polite to each other in real life. 

And for those of you who debate politics on here - just stop. You are changing absolutely no ones mind. The people you are debating might not even be genuine and if they are there is a high chance they are young or completely ignorant. Why the fuck waste your time? You are just needlessly frustrating yourself.

We are all so comfortable, well fed and content that we have to *create* our outrage and our problems. So we all go online and hate on whatever senile old man is leading the opposite political party. We use confirmation bias and create our own little pockets of the internet where we circlejerk and continue to drum each other up so we can become further divided.

*I mean* I feel like summer is ending, but either way I'm excited to really bunker down and create content throughout fall. I was too lazy to create anything on YouTube for basically the entire summer, but now I'm creating some momentum!

NEW VIDEO - ""Having Too Much Fun In Modern Warfare"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlqqmUt-PFQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlqqmUt-PFQ)

So, this video is my new baby and I'm betting on myself to get better, but I need some help.

I'm still learning, but I really need feedback on things such as what does the video need as far as effects, art, video length, edits (does more fat need to be cut). Do I need a more energetic intro, etc. I'm working on it, but I COULD REALLY USE FEEDBACK!!

52,"The state of this world disappoints me. 

The teachings and instruction I received growing up could hardly prepare me for this reality. My parents were extremely strict. Being immigrants, they did their best with what they knew as they were raised in traumatic circumstances themselves. We didn‚Äôt have much but I believe that brought all of us closer together- in a backwards kind of way. My siblings and I. We were taught that as long as we‚Äôre good people, life will be good for us and to us. So I did my best to steer clear of all trouble- of course no one is perfect. I‚Äôve failed many a times. Each time becoming a bit more hopeless. I have limited sexual experiences as I‚Äôve been taught that those impulses can be reckless. I‚Äôve turned down an abundance of sexual opportunities. Only to find out that all of your favorite people have unabashed sexual histories. Something about that reality rattles me to the core. It was all for nothing yet I can‚Äôt bring myself to break these beliefs and participate. All of this was fine growing up. Now, in my late 20s, I don‚Äôt even know what to believe anymore. Nothing fits into the jigsaw puzzle that I have inherited.

Now. Staring into the abyss. I‚Äôve castigated all convention. Nothing is as I thought. I‚Äôm in a decent place in my life but I‚Äôve stumbled all the way here. Nowhere near I dreamt I would be by now. My nightmares are now my dreams: a bath tub filled with waves of ruby. Me deposited at the bottom, slugs to scatter my thoughts. I‚Äôll finally have some piece of mind.

I can see clearly that these thoughts are dangerous. A quality that attracts some people. One of my favorite quotes is ‚Äúif you wouldn‚Äôt do it or say it to yourself from childhood, you shouldn‚Äôt say it to yourself now‚Äù. It breaks my heart to imagine my five year old self saying ‚Äúare you going to kill me?‚Äù So I abstain. I don‚Äôt want to hurt you, little one. The waves that would wash over my hollow shell would not be confined to my chambers. It would flood over the lives of every one who knows and love me: drowning some in the process. Leaving water damage in everyone‚Äôs lives. 

But

the state of this world disappoints me. 
I apologize to all of my loved ones. I apologize to everyone I‚Äôve hurt and will hurt. I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt watch my nieces and nephews grow up...

53,"Let's say, the relationship between us is not the best.

Not like we argue a lot, just that we don't have that much contact.


My parents broke up and had a divorce when I was 9 and my dad was always rather a friend to me than a real father figure.




My family was always prone to some mental health issues, my grandpa on my mother's side suffered from depression (still takes meds with 96) and my mother tends to be really anxious and obsessive about certain things.




My father always seems to have this image in his head that mental health issues is like a blood curse that we pass on to the next generation.




When I told him I was going to therapy, he wasn't happy about it but once I told him what it's for, he looked up the hospital and said that this sounds good and that he wishes me the best.




However he also told that my mother also had issues with low self-esteem and he talked about it like something you can treat like you can train a pet some tricks.



He also asked who's fault it is, if it just genes and I told him in a friendly, but serious way that this is not about fault, but responsibility.
I explained that it's not his , my mom's or my fault, it's just how it is and a combination of various factors and influences.



Like some get cancer, I got depression and GAD. It doesn't help anyone to look for someone to blame, because there is no one, except the circumstances maybe and even those are just results.



Man, it's the way it is. He seemed to have understood this and from his voice I could tell that he's not really happy about it, but he understands that this is how it is and that I seem to need help.






It was a strange but relieving talk for me, cause I hesitated to tell him about this for a few days now.



I usually talk about this with my mother, as she is the one that raised me, the one I've probably spend the majority of my life with.




No matter what his reaction would have been, it's my responsibility to look after me and take care of my own issues.


Some will understand it, some won't and that's again just how it is. At least for now. So instead of getting lost in thoughts and doubts, I shall focus on the road in front of me, one that hopefully leads me into a better life.",05Oct2020,1
54,"2 years ago, I was so dizzy from ocd anxiety that I was not feeling well. Ocd was telling me to do a compulsion!

ocd: You must return home in order to get other paper napkins.

I was so tired to do this compulsion that I tried to make a promise to God that would force me not to do what ocd was telling me to do.

So, I made a promise to God about not returning home in order to get paper napkins. When I was making the promise I was trying to be specific in order not to break it accidentally. I think, I remember when I was making the promise, I was having the image of the way back to the building where I used to live.

I think, I canceled the promise in the last moment but I am not sure if it was canceled.

1 year ago, I was living in a different apartment in a different area than the ones that I tried to make the promise. I left my aparment and ocd was telling me to return in order to take some garbage bags with garbage that needed to be thrown out.

I returned in order to take the garbage bags out. I think, when I arrived, I went to the kitchen to get the garbage bags and saw some other stuff that needed to be thrown out. So, I took these stuff and put them into the garbage bags. Maybe, there is a chance, that one of the stuff that I put in the garbage bags, were paper n apkins

I have not anything in mind about paper napkins. I returned in order to get the garbage bags.

If in case there were paper napkins in the garbage bags, did I break the promise?

1) Was the promise valid only for the moment/day that I made the promise or forever?

2) Was the promise valid only for that aparment that I used to live when I made the promise or for every apartment that I will be living? I think, I remember trying to be specific with my words. And, I think, I imagined a specific way back to the building. Does this mean that the promise is valid only for that way back?

3) I did not return home to get paper napkins. I returned to get the garbage bags without having anything in mind about paper napkins. Maybe there is a chance inside that garbage bags there were paper napkins along with other garbage. Did I broke it",05Oct2020,1

I keep scrolling through memes, it feels like I can't get through the day without checking these apps

I feel need to keep up with certain celebrities, I know it won't help me in my life, but I feel like I need to keep up to date with things happening, otherwise I won't have anything to talk about with my friends.

I tried deactivating my social media multiple times, but everytime I go back, thinking something might have happened that I missed out on.

Whenever I need to study or do some work, I procrastinate by watching YouTube videos and/or mindlessly scrolling through instagram or twitter 

I tried learning the method of mindful consumption, but it just doesn't work for me, I get suck into the hole of wasting my time, even thought I'm aware of it.

How do I let go of the thought that I might be missing out on events happening on the internet, or something interesting?

If any of you successfully got out of that FOMO or social media addiction, please give me advice.

60,"Since I was a little kid, when I would close my eyes and try to fall asleep it would feel like all of a sudden my body was HUGE and my head was very small. I would put my hands over my face to try and ‚Äòequalize‚Äô it but that never worked and I felt so disconnected from myself trying to sleep.

Now I read about Alice in Wonderland Syndrome (AIWS) a few minutes ago. The definition is, ‚Äòa set of symptoms with alteration of body image (particularly with sizing of body parts). It most commonly happens at night.‚Äô

Then I went further into depth and literally JUST found (right before I wrote this sentence) that AIWS usually causes the head and hands to seem disproportionate. Which is exactly what happens to me all the time! I found that here- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302569/

68,So i live in the upper penisula of Michigan and up until today worked in a lumber mill. i have really bad anxiety/depression and with everything going on in the world today my conditions are worsening. i was only employed there for about 2 months and hated it from the very start. i would work 7 am to 3pm most days if that is what they decided to work that day if not that then 5am to 3pm and i wouldnt know till eight before my shift ended the day before. i stood on a sketchy machine for eight plus hours a day throwing planks of wood five times my weight and the pay was weekly but so small it was impossible to get ahead. Ive been having panic attacks every morning before i go in and on the way to work even sometimes while i was there. My co workers and boss were some of the rudest people ive ever met constantly giving me shit cause i was the smallest guy there and obviously out of my element. So this morning i had to be there at 7am i woke up at 5 45 and my wonderful girlfriend asked me what was wrong (ive been hiding my issues with my job from her) and i just broke down told her everything and she told me she trust me to do whats right and to do what makes me happy and is 100% supportive of whatever decision i make. So after a talk with her i set off to my job and made my decision to hit the pavement today and focus all my energy in finding something better quickly cause due to what i was doing and the hours i worked it was almost impossible to find something new while working there. im scared i made a mistake but im not alone i have a amazing support system of people that just want me to be comfortable and happy and that make me know that im going to be okay as long as i stay positive.,05Oct2020,1

I heard a podcast where the founder of AngelList said that having more advice from more people just makes you run around in circles. Since then I‚Äôve been trying to find a single quote which I‚Äôd like to base my life on so that decision making is as simple as possible.

I don't care what your favorite color, your religion, or your political stance is. However, if your beliefs align with oppressing other people and their rights due to their gender, race, religion, and/or social status, etc., then you're just an asshole...

Same thing applies if your beliefs directly put other people in harms away. For example: Not wearing a mask during a pandemic.

There's a difference between a decent human being with different beliefs than being an entitled asshole.

96,"I woke up to a nightmare. I was on the assembly line and my station changed. I didn‚Äôt know where the parts were. I fell behind. I had to get other people to help me. It was a mess.

I went into work to a new job. The boss told the leader to train me on this job... he left after doing two cars. I didn‚Äôt know what to do I just stood there. Two people beside asked if I knew what I was doing. I told them that I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs my first day, that guy over there is supposed to train me.

Honestly, I could have tried. I did this job a couple years ago. The problem is that the job has changed since then and I barely remembered this job so I stood by hoping that the trainer would come back. He didn‚Äôt. Another guy trained me for four hours. The boss expects people to know the job like the back of their hand no matter how difficult it is in four hours.

I needed eight hours. The whole day. It was in my agreement with HR that every new hire would be trained for eight hours.

I didn‚Äôt get those eight hours. The guy that trained me had to leave after four hours. The guy that was supposed to train originally was barely at my station helping me. I had to tell him to help me because I was falling behind.

Over all it was a bad first day. I felt like I was going to throw up. I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone because they would have sent me home early. I knew it wasn‚Äôt COVID because... I didn‚Äôt eat breakfast, I ran to one car to the next, I didn‚Äôt have enough time to drink my water, I was almost crying, and I was sweating like a pig. Crying and feeling like throwing up are my signs of low blood sugar.

0/10 would not recommend. The benefits and pay are the only reason I‚Äôm here. I would like to leave. I wish I asked for the office job instead of the assembly line.",05Oct2020,1

98,"Hi, I‚Äôm 30f and very unhappy with my employment. If you think you can help navigate me out of this and into a better situation, please reach out. If you don‚Äôt, kindly move on to another post. I am having a terrible day and I just really am desperate for compassion and potentially some help out of my situation. I‚Äôm sorry if the below looks insane, I‚Äôm just trying to get this out as best as possible. 

In April of 2017, I was fired from my job working as a car sales woman for Mercedes Benz. I worked there for 3ish years, started as a receptionist and worked my way into sales, but was horrible at it. I only have a HS Diploma and at the time, I lived alone. I ended up having to move back home with my mom. I struggled to find employment until my aunt reached out to a woman who was looking for some help. I met with her and knew I immediately needed to work for her. She was incredible. She created a position for me at the company I work for now, and I became her assistant. The industry i work in now is Scrap Metal Recycling. 

She had kidney failure, so I did a lot of her work for her while she was in dialysis which was a great learning experience, but I didn‚Äôt really know what i was doing, just how to do it the way she showed me. She had been with the company for 30 years and had a lot of accounts that she ran, so I helped to maintain them. I got to work with her from July 5th to Jan 24th.

Long story short, she died suddenly after her kidney transplant from a blood clot. It was devastating, and I have been extremely unhappy ever since. My relationship with her was downplayed due to her long-standing relationships with the employees at the company, and I had to pick up the pieces. 

I got thrown into the role of a Car Buying Supervisor with a very nice raise that, at the time, seemed impossible for me to ever make so I, of course, took it. This was one of her departments that she ran. The department was simple at the time, but has grown to be more complex now and requires knowledge and experience that I simply do not have. I don‚Äôt know anything about cars/parts value, etc. I was never supposed to be doing this and I have tried to learn, but I just absolutely hate the subject and they don‚Äôt have training materials for his department, it was very amateur when she put it together and nobody cared about it.

My current supervisor is someone who I just do not resonate with. We don‚Äôt see eye to eye. She is a micro manager, and I crumble under the pressure. In the last two and a half years with her as my supervisor, I have developed situational depression, anxiety disorder, and IBS. I have shit my pants at work due to nerves from meetings with her, thrown up, had countless panic attacks, and developed an eating disorder towards the end of last year into the middle of this year. I am not healthy. 

Being sent to work from home was the best thing that could‚Äôve happened because I didn‚Äôt have to see her anymore. 

I have been seeing a therapist since January 6th of this year once a week and I‚Äôve never missed a session. I am very serious about my mental health as I have always felt that it is a hindrance to my success at work, but I am now beginning to wonder if my work is causing my mental health to crumble. 

I had to speak with my boss on the phone this morning and it was not a good experience. I got dry mouth and basically lost all confidence. She is not an abusive or bad person, I know that she is just a human being, but she is as intense as they get and I just feel overly intimidated by her regardless of the countless therapy sessions we‚Äôve spent discussing how unreasonable my reaction to her is. I have tried and cannot come up with a solution. No amount of breathing exercises, meditation, ice cube in the hand, counting items in the room, and the list goes on helps me when it comes to her. She is the Vice President of my department, and her boss is the president of our company so no, I cannot ask for a different supervisor unless I want to take a pay cut. 

I want to find employment elsewhere immediately for the sake of my health and sanity, but I do not want to work with cars or scrap metal recycling anymore. 

I need to make at least 65k a year in order to support myself. I don‚Äôt even know where to begin, but I know that I need to start somewhere. I am desperate to get out of this industry, specifically cars. 

I feel that what I am asking is a ridiculous request due to my lack of college education and high overhead(rent, bills, etc.) I also feel like a crazy person most of the time because I absolutely fucking hate cars and don‚Äôt ever want to look at another one again, but I somehow have been doing this for over 6 years of my life (car sales, now car buying) due to the fact that I felt like I just had to accept what was offered to me in order for me to afford to live.

What I really want to do is help people. I love music and have been a singer for my whole life, but have lost my passion for it through all of this shit that‚Äôs been going on in my life. I feel like I‚Äôm at a breaking point. I have been tossing around the idea of going to college and getting my bachelors so that I could become a music therapist, but that will take years, and I realized today that I don‚Äôt think I can continue to work for this woman for that long and also take on the stress of schooling. 

To put it simply (because I am exhausted and don‚Äôt have the patience to be reasonable about this request) what career fields can I move into that can offer me 65k a year that have nothing to do with cars or scrap metal recycling and don‚Äôt require me to have a college degree or a shit load of experience in that field? Again. I know that this is ridiculous. Please be kind.",05Oct2020,1

102,"I work part-time on weekends at retail. Two weeks earlier my employer cut my hours by two, said it's orders from HQ. HQ makes a lot of weird decisions so I didn't think much about it. However, two weeks later they hire a new employee, to work on the weekends, the same hours I work, in my department. Here's the kicker, we don't need a new employee, in fact, we finish our work usually ahead of time.

108,"Hi guys,

I am currently a senior at a university. I am currently failing one of my classes and would want to request a withdrawal from a course. Unfortunately, if you do not drop within the first two weeks, the only alternative is to sign a withdrawal form up until early December.  I am scared that my reason for withdrawal will be dismissed because my school will not take my rare disease and mental health problems seriously. 

Here is my story:

 I am a sufferer of a rare disease named Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), which causes my breath, sweat, and urine to smell foul. Everyday, I secrete a smell that ranges from garbage to rotten sewage. This smell will come out of my pores, sweat, breath, and urine. This disease has haunted me for the past 10 years and has made life extremely difficult and unbearable. I can not go to local stores because I will be harassed by local residents. I have been in other counties, where people have mockingly tormented and harassed me for my bad odor. I have done everything to reduce this odor from following the diet, taking supplements, exercising regularly, fasting everyday, and taking homemade probiotics. Although some of these methods have slightly reduced the odor, it is still an issue I deal with regularly. 

 I have been working on alternative meal plans and supplements to cure my disease, but have seen no progress so far. I am worried to go back to school, because of the horrible bullying and harassment I have experienced from my classmates for the past few years .All of my previous work experiences have also ended in disasters. I decided leaving most of my job positions because of the harassment I experienced from coworkers and staff. Most coworkers would not work from me and exclude me from the daily tasks. I have been horrified to go back to work in the upcoming months. I hope that one day I will find a cure to this disease but I do not think there will be a cure anytime soon. 

Although, I thought going into quarantine would make me feel better because I wouldn't be around people who bullied me or tormented me, I found this summer to be one of the most unproductive summers of my lives. During my first few months of quarantine, I was having what I believed to be regular ptsd episodes. I was numb with depression and anxiety and did not do NOTHING for weeks. I literally mean nothing. No chores, no hobbies, studying, going to stores, activities, or anything. It was just me crying and lying in bed. I was afraid to go out and relive my past memories. Although, I experienced this constantly throughout the summer, I still had a goal to take as many classes as I could this semester(18 units) because I would rather take them online than take them in-person. Last year was a tough semester before quarantine due to my illness and I just wanted to take as many classes online virtually so I could finish my degree faster and limit my terms inside the classroom. Although my anxiety and depression have somewhat reduced, I still experience a couple of days in a month where it is impossible to do anything because I am paralyzed with anxiety and depression over my illness and am reliving some of these memories. 

I am considering getting a withdrawal in one course this semester. This will be my first withdrawal from a course at my university. Within the application, I have to provide a serious and compelling reason. I am definitely thinking of not mentioning my rare disease, because I have no medical documentation proving that I have my disease. Since this disease is rare, most of the centers which once tested for this disease have become shut down, due to lack of funding. I have only heard of a handful of individuals who have been able to acquire the testing materials to successfully test for this illness. Most of the research and recognition for this illness comes from the UK. In the UK, patients with this condition have a better time adapting to this condition because they get accommodations and disability benefits. Unfortunately in the US, my experiences in the healthcare field dealing with this condition have been a nightmare. I have gone to several doctors who have been dismissive of me when I bring up that I believe that I have this condition. They have ignored my claims and dismissed my claims. I believe that during my withdrawal form, I should not mention that I believe I have this illness because they will ask me to provide documentation. I have been trying to get doctor's help for years but have not come close to getting their assistance. I am thinking of only touching on my anxiety, depression, and presumed ptsd episodes during the form and mentioning that they take away a significant portion of my time and have led to unsuccessful performances in past examinations or homeworks. I am very confused on what I should write down as my extenuating circumstances. I believe that I do meet this criteria, but am afraid at what I should write down to address this issue. This application will be reviewed by the board so it was very important to get my point across in a serious and well respected manner. I was wondering if any of you could advise me on what I should write down on my withdrawal form.

Thank-you and enjoy the rest of your day.",05Oct2020,1
109,"I'm 22f, at 16 i dropped out of school for my mental health and from there my life started going down.

I'll start with my family, my parents never been affectionate to anyone of us 5 kids and as i grow up it become really normal to not care about each other unless there is an occasion and showing affection is plain cringe to everyone in the family.
I hated this fact cause now I'm at this age and i never felt love from anyone, my emotions don't exist unless its anger or sadness, i hate the fact that i cringe every time i hear or see something romantic i just want to be normal and feel what everyone feels.

For me this is really effecting me negatively, i always feel unwanted and sometimes like i don't even exist. I'm a shy person too and all of this add to my loneliness doesn't help my mentality.

Because i dropped out of school i find it really hard to find a job that can help me start a career and i can't find anyone to ask for help. I'm afraid to apply to any more jobs because i don't want to get rejected again and with the pandemic its juyst keeps getting worse, i feel like I'm losing time with everything stopping me from doing something good for my life.

I did sign up for a course to finish my high-school degree and I'm planning to go to a college or something  but so much keep getting in my way and i keep losing hope in ever being happy in my life.

I really want to have a good life but i dont feel like i belong anywhere and there is nothing keeping me in this place but i don't have anyone to go to, i hate feeling this lonely.",05Oct2020,1

This is not to say that I want to sleep with them, the problem is they use their obnoxious alpha powers to direct women away from me. For instance, I am taking part in a long standing seminar where we will meet biweekly for the next year. The leader is a woman in her 60's, and she noticed early on that several of the women closer to my age were attracted to me. At our second meeting, the first full day meeting, she made sure to pair me with two older women partner and paired another guy, a tall hadsome traditionally reserved type guy with the two younger ladies. When I walked past one of them on my way to the group activity, the tension was palpable, and the seminar leader looked PISSED. I am not a large man, but I am quite effective in bed, in relationships, in communication. I'm very ready to have a serious partner.
