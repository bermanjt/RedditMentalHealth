0,"To be honest I'm just rambling and just trying to put my thoughts into words. I'm too lazy to proofread this, so you may not want to read this but if you do absolutely any feedback at all is appreciated.

**Background:** I'm miserable, wasted my life up to this point with computer/internet/gaming/porn addiction and extreme social isolation/fear of people feedback loop. I've been spinning my wheels since high school and have nothing going on at all.

But I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself. I need to become a man worthy of respect and love. The question is how do I do that? Every time I've asked this on here I don't get an answer. I'm willing to put in the work, I just don't know **WHAT** **TO DO** to become likable, lovable, and respectable.

Something I think that would help me is having hobbies or something of some sort to feel proud of. What kills me is I disappoint myself with every hobby I try. I am pathetic.

**Physical:** I am extremely unathletic, even in school I was always picked last in sports.

* Skating: been messing around with skating for two years but still too scared to drop in (pussy)
* Surfing: been surfing off and on since I was young but not good at it.
* Weightlifting: been lifting for literally 7 years, in an attempt to have a respectable physique. In those 7 years, I've only just recently got a 225 bench for 1 rep. I've come to realize even though I like weightlifting, and the weightlifting/body building community, I simply am not built to lift heavy weights and my body doesn't show that I lift weights unless I take my shirt off (not much even then). So I think why even try.. I have 6.5 inch wrists and I assume low testosterone, those things make lifting heavier weights and gaining muscle really hard, even with employing all sorts of elaborate training techniques. I am also still only 175 lbs at 6'1 despite eating a lot of calories and consistently drinking protein shakes, creatine, you name it.

**Social:**

* For some reason I have always been shy and not talkative since I was a little kid. My parents were extreme narcissists and didn't talk to us enough or teach us any social skills. I spent my entire childhood watching TV and playing video games, largely at other kids houses, only at those friends houses did I learn social skills and manners from my friends parents.
* I have never been, nor do I have any instinct to be ""cool"". Every person I know tries to have some sort of ""cool"" fashion sense, some sort of ""cool"" hobby, cool car, cool music, everything ""cool"". But for some reason I have never had this instinct. For instance I am extremely practical and only buy cheap things. I'm painfully aware of how low I am on the totem pole because of this reality. I don't have many followers on instagram, never really cared about that but yeah, these things seem to affect our real world social status.
* I don't care about ""pride"" or being some confident, cool guy. I don't even know what that feels like since I've never been confident or proud of myself. It seems that being confident even faking it is preferable to women than being even a little not confident.
* I'm boring as fuck, which makes me want to isolate even more. If my roommate brings friends over I always stay in my room and don't introduce myself, because I know they won't like me.

**Romantic:**

* Never had a real girlfriend or been on a real date. Virgin.
* Not that I'm some stud, but I don't think I'm ugly. I've consistently had girls show interest in me both when I was younger and recently. Never really pursued them because of social anxiety I guess. I've only ever been approached by girls, I've never approached them.
* Have kissed a few girls, not really an accomplishment. Hook ups and everything of that sort are completely meaningless to me when I can just jerk off. It takes me a while to warm up to people, so I wouldn't want to have sex with a stranger or on the first date.

**Mental:** I'm a dumbass, but I'm just self-aware enough to not to be blissfully ignorant that I am a dumbass. FML.

* Extreme social anxiety, which has comparatively calmed down a lot in the past year since I started taking magnesium and other supplements.
* Extreme ADHD and possibly undiagnosed aspergers.
* Constant mental fog and irrational, neurotic thoughts.
* Extremely **avoidant** of life, friends have to force me to go outside
* Very lazy
* The past couple years or so I have bad **anhedonia**. I don't enjoy anything most of the time, even things I used to enjoy a lot.
* I always takes the path of least resistance.
* Got extremely poor grades in school, I remember I had the 7th lowest GPA in my class one year, I also flunked 11th grade. I used to think I was dumb or retarded for the longest time, but people have said I'm ""smart"" enough at this point I've finally accepted I'm average intelligence, but I still choose to do really stupid things for some reason. Needless to say my parents never expected me to go to college, I never went, and now I feel inferior to every one of my peers who at least attempted to go to college (all of them).
* Reading books is absolute torture to me. This is something I really hate about myself. I've only finished a few books over the years, started at least a dozen. This kills me because how can I ever become smart adult and have conversations with smart people if I absolutely hate reading? I worry that I'll never be seen ""smart"" enough to impress anyone. I do enjoy documentaries and podcasts though.
* Learning Languages: this is something I actually kinda enjoyed, but I don't think I will ever regularly be able to speak to a Japanese person unless I moved to japan for example, which I'm not, so continuing to learn the language is almost useless.

**Creative:**

* I used to draw a lot when I was younger, completely passionless for it now. Never had much talent either.
* Zero musical talent.
* Terrible writer.

**TL;DR, I'm bad at everything in every way, thus I will never be confident, thus I will never get a girlfriend or live a normal happy existence.**

**Conclusion:**

I'm depressed. I have no direction or purpose. I am of no value to anyone, basically worthless. What should I do to ""fix"" myself (if possible), become worthy of love, and become happy/not depressed all the time? Also, do you have any hobby suggestions? Thank you.",04May2020,1

I don't want to be stoned. But that's something I'm scared of.

I don't want to be stoned. I want to feel clear.

10,"im 16 and i got my learner’s permit around four months ago and i feel like i make the same mistakes over and over again when i’m driving. i’m always turning too late and then i end up making a wide turn on a two way street, i can’t park, whenever i try to look over my shoulder to check my blind spots i look for too long n end up almost crashing into the car that is suddenly in front of me, i’m terrible at merging in busy areas, i can’t stay in my lane, my attentiveness to the things around me is bad, i’m just overall really a terrible driver.

i don’t practice that often, maybe like thirty minutes a week. and i know that these things take time and practice but i’m always too tense when i’m driving. i always feel like i’m gonna crash into someone or something and i just never want to get into the drivers seat ever again.

i’m scared i’ll never be able drive safely enough to pass my drivers test that’s in july, especially since i need to be able to drive to my school alone due to certain circumstances. it’s like one day i’ll be able to drive just fine and then next i’m swerving into the bike lane with bikers present. i’m honestly scared of my own driving.",04May2020,1
12,"I already told some family and a close friend but I'm still worried. So I've come here to unleash it on you guys instead. Hi.

I got out of the shower last night, looked in the mirror and immediately noticed that one of my pupils was dilated like crazy ([example](https://www.merckmanuals.com/-/media/manual/home/images/613-anisocoria-due-to-horner-syndrome-springer-high.jpg?la=en&amp;thn=0) of what that looks like). I didn't feel weird otherwise but it was big enough to catch me off guard when I saw it.

Went and showed my mom. She had me go around a lamp to see if it was something like maybe one pupil was getting more light than the other. But no, the one pupil was still dilated. Now we're worried.

She tells me to wait it out, so I do. What I didn't immediately tell her was (a) my vision briefly got weird, like I couldn't focus, and (b) the side of my face where my pupil was weird went numb. Neither lasted long, and nothing else happened aside from my pupil still being dilated. I just spent the rest of the night pacing around and watching the pupil slowly return to normal.

It's back to normal today (for *now*, as far as I know), but this whole time I've had a dull pain that comes and goes behind the one eye. I don't want to be a hypochondriac, but it's hit a lot of check boxes for an unruptured aneurysm (side-tracking: having an aneurysm has been an irrational fear of mine since I was little, and sometimes I'd even check to make sure my pupils weren't weird whenever I felt pains in my head; imagine how I felt finally seeing it happen).

All the clinics are closed until tomorrow where I am, and I don't feel like it's severe enough to constitute seeking emergency help just yet. Gonna take it easy and, unless any reddit doctors convince me otherwise, I'm gonna wait 'till tomorrow to go to a clinic or urgent care.

Right now I'm getting my laundry out of the way, so there's that. At least I'll be clean and fresh.",04May2020,1
13,"Friend of mine who was a life long democrat let off some steam over the phone about how the cancellation of our city volleyball and softball leagues are absurd. Very frustrated. ""The fucking Democrats aren't going to let us play!"" was an exact quote. Stating they wish they lived in a 'red state' right now.

Meanwhile a Republican friend wrote a Facebook status begging their friends to stop sharing conspiracy theories about COVID-19 because both of their parents have it. Their Facebook profile pic is a frame that says ""Stay the Fuck Home"" - before that is a MAGA pic frame! 

Politics is going to get even more polarizing because of this.

I'm starting to fully realize Coronavirus is the equivalent of 9/11, the Iraq war or the great recession - its becoming very personal and the actions of the government will permanently impact people's political persuasion.",04May2020,1
14,"**tl;dr: I can't promise constant or even daily chats, but if we connect on some level I have a genuine interest in maintaining that. I'm pretty much an open book and fairly opinionated, so send me something insightful or interesting and we can chat. Send me an unpopular opinion or a podcast you think is cool. I'm here because I'm awkward, but I'm working on it.**

**Disclaimer:** I have zero expectation that anyone will care about this, so to just read skip to the end.

**Timeline**

2014-2016: I was that really silent girl in your class whose name you didn't even know in a small, southern town. SUPER nerdy blasian, had a chip on my shoulder after getting bullied, etc.. Went online and met people through that, which turned into having this weird double life. Had two never-met LDRs that crashed and burned, but very few interactions with people offline excluding my family, and my soccer team.

2016-2018: Hiatus to focus on school. Not as silent now, but had a very /r/nicegirls attitude regarding why I wasn't being asked out at school and posted on here for short-term validation. After I got into college, I had a couple of successful meet-ups from people, but they never went very far because I was still not investing much in in-person relationships.

2018-2019: Switched to online dating and had more dates, though I still didn't have the type of friend group I wanted. I showed up to each class and formal 'get to know your classmates' event, but didn't know why things didn't seem to progress beyond that. Started seeing a therapist for anxiety and adhd. Had great grades and extracurricular activities, so people who knew me assumed I was fine.

2020:  I've made it a goal to start calling myself out on my bullshit and challenging myself. I changed career paths (premed --&gt; business) to be more honest about what I want out of undergrad and joined greek life to force myself to build relationships with people. I obviously haven't made great progress on that since I'm still here, seeking companionship, but this time I promise 2 things:

1.) Make a legit effort to talk about things we're interested in and keep in touch

2.) To respond within 24 hours (unless I've blocked you, which would happen if you sent me a picture unsolicited) with either a yes or no and why. Same thing for if I'm not interested later on

I've spoken to hundreds of people over the years, but made only a handful of meaningful connections. I'm trying something different now with a clean slate. If it doesn't work, I can safely conclude it's cause I'm an ass.

**About Me**

* College student studying looking for people to voice chat, and/or game with
* Big fan of dance! I'm a member of my school's dance team. Trying to commit to being more fit also
* I'm told I have an ASMR type voice lol
* I like to talk about philosophy, current events, and economics, so if you're an avid WSJ reader or listen to podcasts like Hidden Brain we'll get along

**About You (I hope)**

I'd say ""thanks for coming to my TED talk"" but I got rejected from speaking at my school's TEDx event. So... thanks for observing my scream into the void! If this is up, I'm still looking.

18,"I was abused growing up, physically and emotionally, by my sibling and my parents. The result of what happened left me socially isolated into adulthood. My parents would also alternate between these periods of telling me they want me to have friends, and these episodes where they would scream and call me selfish if I spent any time away from them. I also ended up developing a mindset where everything that went wrong was my fault, because I was often blamed for things that, in retrospect, I can see weren't.

&amp;#x200B;

I cut ties with my family years ago, and I decided to focus on my marriage. I ended up engaging in the same pleasing and self-blame behaviors with my ex. I rationalized that I was trying to be a supportive spouse, and I took care of every day-to-day thing outside of work that needed to be done so she could focus on her new career when we moved to a new city. Cooking, cleaning, maintenance and repair, walking the dogs several times, etc. Things got to the point where I was staying up 20 hours a day to work full-time, take care of everything, spend time with her, and work on my own masters degree. Things got bad for her at her job, and she started taking it out on the marriage. We tried therapy together. After a while the therapist suggested she was letting her work negatively affect her personal life. She got angry and filed for divorce.  


&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm in my mid-30s. I've got no family, no wife, and I'm in a city with barely any people that I know. I'm taking the time to focus on me and enjoy myself. Allow myself to recharge emotionally.  Despite that, I still get some coworkers pressuring me to have kids at my age. When I occasionally date, I have women in my age range automatically asking me how soon they can expect to have kids. I wish this was an exaggeration, but I actually had one woman I went out with tell me that if I didn't agree to give a woman my own age children soon in the relationship, that I was going to die alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was still in contact with my family, I absolutely didn't want children. I didn't want to expose a child to my family, and I was frankly a little afraid I was damaged by what they had done to me. When I cut contact with them though, I became more open to the idea of kids. My ex told me she never wanted them though, so I didn't push it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I feel like I've spent the majority of my life living according to other people's wishes. My parents/family, my ex, etc. - I am open to the idea of having children eventually, but right now if I meet someone, I want to allow myself to be a little selfish with that person. Enjoy other things life has to offer for the time being, possibly with someone else along the way.",04May2020,1
19,"My dad suffered from drug addiction for my entire life and in 2010 it was the worst it had been. Before he overdosed, he wrote me a letter.

21,"I got a text from my sister about graduation gowns, asking if I had ordered mine. I did not because I didn't care about graduation. We got to talking about job searching and I told her I had been looking. While that's true.. I haven't been searching as hard as I can. I've only filled out 2 applications so far because I don't know how to drive (most jobs require a drivers license). I'm 19 freaking years old and don't know how to drive. She said I shouldn't be like her, I should do these things now and not wait. Then she said I should go to school to be a veterinarian because that's what I wanted to do when I was little. I don't want to do that anymore. In fact, I don't know what I want to do. I have no passion for anything. Sometimes I think I'm depressed but then it seems like I'm just trying to make excuses to be lazy. I've only barely made it through high school, I don't know how I could go to college let alone *pay* for it. This is a time where people have it figured out, or at least have an inkling in what they want out of life. Me? I have no clue. I used to want to make something of myself. But then when asked ""what do you want to do as a career?"" I'd come up blank. Absolutely nothing would come to mind and I would just awkwardly say ""I don't know"". That has been my answer ever since I started high-school, and now high-school is almost over and it's still the same answer. I feel empty and a soon to be failure.

29,"I'm in an LDR and my bf comes to one of the Chicago airports to meet me. He brings a suitcase with a fuck ton of valuables inside. There's a Nintendo switch, five days worth of outfits, cash, his 2,000 dollar laptop (with no warranty, he got it second hand), and a Samsung tablet good for writing notes in class and such.   
We park the car in a 2-hour zone with a security camera in front and then we leave to get lunch. We come back to the car and then we see something a little disconcerting... the window had been broken and his suitcase disappeared. It was a hatchback and his suitcase was in window view.   
I began to freak out because oh god this poor guy... he's got no clothes or toiletries and he just lost about 4,000 dollars worth of stuff. He's not very mad though, there's really no use.

We spend most of the visit trying to get his stuff back and he eventually finds the Nintendo switch with a few niche games of his along with a speaker he got in China. 

By this time we had got in contact with the Chicago PD but they were extremely slow. So, I made an account and an offer for the switch. We agreed on it but he could tell I was definitely being overeager so he backed out of the deal. The next hour and the switch had been sold. 

But we wanted to meet the guy so I offered for something else on his profile with a different account... a locked apple watch. 

This time it worked, we met up with him and flagged down the police near us. After having done all their work for them, we compiled evidence and even matched the listed serial number of the switch with the switch my bf brought to the city, they said they weren't going to pursue the case further.  

  
I mean yeah,,, guy is selling a locked apple watch and the same game that was stolen from my bf and we have screenshots... sure definitely not worth pursuing.

38,"To start off, I will admit that the only friend I ever had was in elementary. I enjoyed his company, and wanted to be around him. But all good things eventually do come to an end, and after I changed schools we stopped talking. After elementary, I never made friends with anyone again. But then I realized that inside, I’m just apathetic towards making friends at all and I don’t know why. I was always content with just staying inside playing video games. I always thought I was just kinda a loser with no social skills up until college. Surprisingly, there have been a few people that came up to me and said they wanted to hang out with me, but Still, I am completely apathetic towards making friends at all. Every single time when someone shows interest in me I just withdraw, and they will understandably get upset with me. Even though I can socialize with people, I just feel as if it’s all part of an act. On top of this, I cant feel a deeper connection to people at all. It was only recently until I made that observation. I can’t say I like anyone, but at the same time I don’t hate anyone either. Talking to people feels like another chore. The fact that I’m even writing this post shows that on at least some level I want to make friends, but there’s still some carelessness in me.I don’t want to be lonely for the rest of my life, but at the same time it’s not all bad.

In my dream, I was in a school shooting, I tried hiding in a crate, the shooter (a real life friend of a friend) found me almost instantly, and shot me directly in the face. What happened next has really been bothering me lately. I didn’t think we could die in our dreams, and if that really is true, then I cannot explain what happened. But everything went completely white in my dream for a bit, like I dreamt and *felt* the color white. I don’t know how to explain it but... the white was tangible. Then i was instantly in this weird neon-colored chat room type thing, where the names (not physical bodies) of a few of my close friends and my ex-boyfriend who I still love very much (and have been having a hard time since the break up) was there. And so, these names, they kinda lit up when people spoke. And I tried dancing but my ex’s name lit up and it was his voice saying “no [my name] it’s just our souls speaking now, we don’t have bodies” and then I told him I loved him and his name’s light went out and I woke up in tears.

However, I am struggling to accomplish anything due to a massive fear/insecurity of mine. My sisters have always been annoying, but my twin has taken to bullying me in recent years. She makes me feel bad about everything I do, and finds ways to make me miserable constantly. My biggest fear is that if I do something big, such as sing a song, or gain any kind of popularity, she’ll find out, and make me feel even worse about myself. To make matters worse, I’m shut in with them 24/7 due current circumstances, eliminating any chance for me to sing. I don’t know what to do, and am stuck in a loop of daydreaming, brainstorming, then crashing as I realize what my sister would do if I followed through. Any advice or questions are welcome.

48,"So I recently cut ties with a friend I’ve had for like 7 years. But I’m hesitant to label her as a toxic friend, because we did have a lot of good times together, and that’s not the only way I wanna remember our friendship. But on the other hand I wanna be able to recognize the signs of a toxic relationship so it doesn’t happen to me later in life. Help me out guys? I’ll try to be as unbiased as possible here. 

This is gonna be a long one so tl;dr at the bottom. 

Person in question is named “Hannah” (not real name). We’ve been best friends all through middle school and almost all of high school. I’m 18f and a high school senior. At the beginning of this school year I started hanging out with this really great group of people. Thing is, Hannah did not take this change well. I will admit I neglected her at first, but after she talked to me about it I apologized and promised to make a better effort to include her. And I believe I did: I invited her to every outing we planned, always encouraged her to sit with us at lunch, and even made sure to arrange times for us to hang out, just the two of us. 

However, this was complicated because this group of people like to go out and party and drink. Hannah doesn’t, so she always declined our invitations. I understand that and don’t fault her for it. I wanted to remedy this so I offered more solutions, such as maybe scheduling days where we would sit apart from the group, and I also once again invited her to hang out where it would just be us two. Even so, Hannah was unhelpful with trying to make things work. She kept insisting these wouldn’t work. I asked her what she wanted me to do, but she wouldn’t give me a straight answer. She never said it explicitly, but I think she just wanted me to leave the group and have things go back to the way we were when it was just me and her. I didn’t want to do this, because, though I wouldn’t ever say this to her, I was a lot happier with this new group of friends. 

The thing is, with this new group, I realized I had been stifled under my relationship with Hannah. With her, it was kind of her way or highway. We always did what she wanted to do, and talk to who she wanted to talk to, so I never really knew who I was as an individual, or what I liked to do. 

Also, Hannah was never in the wrong, it was always me who had to please her. When something went wrong in the relationship, Hannah would ice me out until I apologized, even though she might also have been responsible. I felt like I was always bending over backwards to make her happy, and to keep the peace in the friendship. It got exhausting sometimes. 

She also liked to keep me on a schedule of sorts. In my underclassman years, I had to be online at 7pm so we could chat while we did homework. If I was late she would say by how many minutes I was late. One time I was really tired, so I skipped that and just went to bed, and woke up to my phone blown up with messages asking me where tf I was and how I was so inconsiderate to “do this to her again”. It was hard for me to focus most of the time when we chatted, but I let it go until I got to my junior year and our workload REALLY piled up. I told her a week in advance that I wouldn’t be doing this schedule anymore, but I feel like she didn’t really acknowledge it. When I declined her call a week later, she kind of flipped out, becoming passive aggressive in our dms and saying “whatever floats your boat”. The next day I brought her a slice of cake as a peace offering. She continued to call me most nights, although she didn’t say anything when I wasn’t online exactly at 7 anymore. 

Hannah sometimes subtly restricted who I could talk to as well, especially with guys. Sometimes I would strike up a conversation with someone in the lunch line, and we’d be vibing for a bit, but Hannah would interrupt us saying things like “cut that out she’s /my/ best friend”. She would also try to control who I had a relationship with too. Last summer I dated this guy for a bit, and we continued talking even after we had to part ways. Hannah talked to the guy without letting me know first, and when she decided she didn’t like him, told me to cut him out of my life (I didn’t, to which she continuously voiced her strong disapproval).

Unlike my new friend group, Hannah didn’t celebrate my victories. Yes, she was excited when I made the varsity team, but I mean like my character development. Hannah hates change above anything else, so whenever I exhibited any sort of difference to how I was the previous day, Hannah would be quick to point it out and make me feel self conscious about it. She pointed out my physical flaws a lot too, like if I hadn’t shaved my legs in a while or if my hair was getting really frizzy. And if I made a decision she didn’t agree with, she wouldn’t hesitate in saying how “dumb” it was, usually more than once. Like when I had to decline dream college because tuition was too high, for example. In the beginning of the school year when I was just started to get integrated with the group, Hannah told me I would never truly be a part of it. I was planning to invite the group to my birthday party at the beach later in the year, and she told me that they wouldn’t care about me, they would just care about the “clout” of being at the beach and getting free alcohol. I think she was scared of losing me, but it really hurt to hear all that, as this was a huge insecurity for me at the time. 

Towards the end of our friendship, she used her emotions make me feel responsible for her. All of this relationship-related turbulence, plus the stress of everything that comes with senior year, made her fall into depression. I learned from a mutual friend that she had said to him she felt suicidal. Me and this friend worked together to support her, planned a get together for her birthday (really it was to keep an eye on her), and made sure a lot of trusted adults knew. However, after that incident, she often would message me after learning about a party that I had been to, and reminded me to “keep in mind how that made her feel”. 

She would also make me feel selfish. For example, she was talking to me again about our relationship, and when I said I’ve been trying to make things work, she responded with “well you’ve done a shit job of showing it”, which really hurt. This has been a commonality throughout our friendship though, I’ve always felt like a shit friend, and this resulted in me giving as much as I could. So when she said that, I think that’s when I decided to just let our relationship die. I figured if everything I was doing wasn’t enough, then nothing would be. She hasn’t done anything to reach out to me since. 

So if y’all managed to read through all that without falling asleep, congrats and thank you. Now what do you guys think?

TL;DR ended a relationship that was one-sided and controlling, friend was dictating who I could talk to, what I could do, I was always in the wrong, possibly she was emotionally manipulative?",04May2020,1
49,"I just woke up from a really nice dream in which I was going on an adventure with a bunch of friends. It ended too soon and I found myself trying to go back to sleep to continue the dream, but I couldn't

In real life I don't have any friends. I'm 20 and my life is so sad and boring I feel like it's going to be like this forever. The only interesting part of my life is dreaming.

I wish I could do the same thing. I love lucid dreaming which is where you become conscious in the dream state. I just am always amazed at what incredible stories and places and people my mind will create.

So I have a question. Is this a good thing to distract from this? Wouldn't it be better to think about a solution?

61,"I’ve had depression and anxiety since I was 18 after facing a traumatic event. Before that, although I was always an introvert and more self conscious than the average teenager, it never seriously impacted my life. I never scored anything below 90% in an exam, and whatever I wanted, I worked for it and got it. My biggest worry in life was being more outgoing and making more friends. I had a “life/career plan” that I remember having since I was as young as 9.

After the depression and anxiety started, it was almost as if I went into a period of psychosis. I hardly remember anything from a 2 year period apart from a few social gatherings and incidents where I was physically violent (threw and broke things at home). Towards the end of this very bad period, I started to get a little better and I went to university. 

University was extremely hard and although the depression was slowly getting better, my anxiety took the front seat. Every single term and exam was excruciatingly difficult. This has been humiliating and shameful for me as I have never had this problem before. I lost all the friends that I made at the start of university due to being completely shut in my house apart from whenever it was absolutely necessary. Loneliness has definitely played a big part in my journey back to normal taking longer. 

Now, almost 5 years in to being at university, I am doing much better in terms of my mental health. I can’t describe it without it sounding like a cliche but over the past few months it feels as if a dark cloud has been lifted and the fogginess has gone. I have also lost 70lbs - weight that I put on due to emotional/binge eating that was also causing a great deal of anxiety/shame.

I know that my “mental health story” seems like a success to most. After all that’s happened, I will be a doctor by the age of 25 and my “career/life plan” hasn’t really been affected. However, I just can’t stop feeling sad and jealous every time I think about all the great moments that depression stole from me, even though I know a lot of them are silly. 

I will be turning 25 and have absolutely no solid friendships. I’ve never dated in my adult life. I never had the “college/university experience”. I quit all my childhood hobbies and feel like I’m not good at anything. I’ve lost many opportunities that would’ve been great for my career. I sat at home crying whilst all my peers were doing great at school and still going on several holidays a year. 

It upsets me to think about the person I would have been if I never suffered the traumatic event. I can’t help but feel I’ve lost what were supposed to be the best years of my life and the real adulthood phase is fast approaching (insane work hours, settling down, kids).

I’m trying my best now to “start over” and do all the things I wish I would’ve done when I was unwell. I know that 2 years or so of serious hard work at my goals (physical, music, languages, business) can equal what I would’ve done at uni. It’s just hard sometimes when I continue to think about the past! 

If anyone has any words of wisdom, personal experience, something they can point me to that they think will be helpful - please do!",04May2020,1
63,"It has been 6 months since the break up. I felt that he treated me badly and it brought me into a deep depression. At the same time, I also felt a lot of guilt, because I sometimes feel that a lot of things that went wrong were my fault. He claims that I was emotional abusive towards him with all of my mood swings and that I was being unfair. But a lot of people tell me that they think that HE was the one being abusive towards ME. I think I know the answer already, but I just want to have it confirmed and get some opinions from someone who doesn't know me.

We were together for 2 years, but throughout the entire relationship I felt very insecure and anxious. We agreed almost from the beginning that we wanted to be a couple, but I also knew that commitment was difficult for him, so I tried to be patient. It took him almost over a year getting comfortable enough calling me his gf and to hold my hand and kiss me in public, and I thought once all of this happened, I would not feel insecure anymore. I was wrong, but by this time I had grown such strong feelings for him that it was hard for me to get out. I had somehow convinced myself that he was the love of my life, and I spent a lot of time and energy trying to work on the relationship. 

He made me think that I was mental. He kept accusing me of having all kinds of mental disorders. If I tried to stand up for my self, or even if I tried to communicate with him about something that bothered me, he would accuse me of wasting his time  and would kick me out and ignore me completely from anywhere between a couple of days to over a week. This happened at least once a month for the last year of our relationship. He would even threaten to cut me out of his life completely or break up with me. 

If I tried to express how I felt and that I think that he was unfair for treating me like this, he would turn all the blame on me and make it my own fault; that it was my own actions that made these things happen to begin with. If I expressed that I wanted us to become official soon, he would say that he would have asked me to become official a long time ago, if only I had behaved right. He made me wait for him. 

One time, a girl contacted me, and sent me screenshots of a conversation between him and her, where they were flirting. She didn't know I existed when she wrote him, even though I had been with him for 1,5 years at that time and their conversations had been going on just as long. She contacted me as soon as she found out about me. I confronted him about it and showed him the screenshots, but I ended up being the one having to apologize to him, because I was being ""unfair"". He flirted a lot with others during our time together and I have several theories that he also cheated on me several times.

The story of our break up is a whole other story, and would make this post waaaay too long... but the short version is that he became physically abusive towards me, and when I later called him out on it, he exploited me on social media and tried to convince everyone that I was mental. 

I did end up in therapy because of our relationship which he also knows. But till this day, he is still convinced that he was the victim and he did nothing wrong. That I was emotionally abusive towards him. I did do a lot of irrational things during our relationship and I probably wasn't completely innocent either. But even though I believe his actions were the cause of my behavior and frustrations, I still try to take responsibility for my actions. I just wish he would do the same.",04May2020,1

76,"For the past year, I have had immense societal pressure to be non-religious. I'm an unruly teenage white boy from the UK, so why should I even be religious in the first place?

Because I'm an orphan with relationship problems, I depended on things like exposure to the internet, media, and culture, instead of the traditional parents, teachers and friend circle, to develop a sense of self. I would compare myself to others a hell of a lot. An idea of how I should be ideally would form at the back of my mind, and I would follow that ideal - I call it the internal identity, whereas the external identity is who I really am. It is unhealthy for the two identities to contradict or even differ from each other. A year later, I still have the exact same problem. I know that I'm \[this is awkward\] a Christian but I'm too ashamed of it because in this modern, secularized western world religion is often looked down upon.

It's a paradox because Christianity probably teaches self-love, this thing with God loving you more than any other being, but then again, I can't accept myself for being Christian anyway. I literally don't know what to do. I might look into different religions, but I'm scared because some Christians (like Jehovah's Witnesses as one example) see all the other religions as the work of Satan, and I also once considered converting to Judaism but I realized that I just didn't have any faith in that religion. I also don't 'get' Asian religions like Buddhism and Taoism, I'm that much of an idiot.

A million random thoughts (unconnected to this whole shebang with religion, but just as bugging anyway) rush through my head and drive me crazy. I can't meditate right now, as I need my phone with plenty charge to do that so I can put my headphones on and listen to relaxing music, like ambient or jazz. I think that self-help books are a total waste of time, as well, because finding and loving oneself is a highly subjective thing. I could go follow what makes me happy and what gives my life a sense of purpose but I'm extremely image-conscious always too caught up in what others think of me. The status-seeking anxiety is so big and prevailing, once I get it, it crawls into all my thoughts and fucks up all my actions and confuses me with contradictions and everything. It feels horrible.

But all good things eventually do come to an end, and after I changed schools we stopped talking. After elementary, I never made friends with anyone again. But then I realized that inside, I’m just apathetic towards making friends at all and I don’t know why. I was always content with just staying inside playing video games. I always thought I was just kinda a loser with no social skills up until college. Surprisingly, there have been a few people that came up to me and said they wanted to hang out with me, but Still, I am completely apathetic towards making friends at all.

The fact that I’m even writing this post shows that on at least some level I want to make friends, but there’s still some carelessness in me.I don’t want to be lonely for the rest of my life, but at the same time it’s not all bad. It’s just another internal contradiction that I don’t know that if it can be solved. But I do know one thing. If I first want to make friends, I need to have the desire to do so.",04May2020,1
83,"With everything that has gone on in the world lately I have been a lucky one that has been able to continue to work. Part of that working was from home but I figured at the start of April that it was time for a bit of a change and dedication/discipline. While fairly athletic (avid mountain biker) I rarely go to the gym nor do I lift weights at home. So things like punch-ups, pull-ups, crunches, etc. are semi-easy but not overly.

April 1 I started the 100/30 challenge, doing 100 push-ups and 100 crunches a day. I succeeded in doing the challenge all while still riding 50+ miles a week, tearing up my front lawn and digging a whole new sprinkler system and doing a bunch more ""manual labor"" tasks!

93,"My ex is an incredibly talented, motivated Type A personality who bases a lot of her self-worth on her occupation. She worked 10+ years to get to where she did, so I could understand the pride she took in what she did. Outwardly at work, she was friendly and sweet. On social media she presented herself as living a happy life. When she got home though, it was like she was an empty shell. She was on meds for anxiety and depression since the job started. Both of these feelings worsened for her, especially after she told her boss she was quitting, and he replied by telling her it wasn't a big deal and that he expected her back within a year. She panicked about leaving and decided to stay. She changed after this. It was like she took the resentment she felt toward the job and put it on the marriage.  I was afraid to confront her about things at first, because she told me early on that men bringing up her work habits was a trigger for her. That she'd ended previous relationships because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

She started drinking more heavily, going from 1-2 beers a week to 2 mixed drinks with vodka a night. She stopped talking to me or looking at me. Pushed me away completely, and started posting provocative images of herself online. The kind of pictures that could have gotten her fired if her bosses saw them. If I tried to talk to her, she would get angry. We tried therapy at her suggestion, and she either got angry with my attempts to communicate or otherwise found a fault with the therapist's suggestions. After about 6 months the therapist suggested that she might be allowing her work life to negatively affect her personal life. She got angry at this, filed for divorce, and moved out two weeks later. I haven't spoken to her in over a year.

When I'm not cripplingly depressed, I'm awash in regret and nostalgia. It controls my life. I have two or three states of mind, in other words. I can either be intensely sad or I can be regretful that my life and career goals have not worked out. Or I can be nostalgic, to an unhealthy degree. 

I'm the least successful person I know. I've lived with my parents twice in the past several years. I am in massive debt. There are plenty of people from my past who would describe me as a hapless, over-reaching failure. I had quite an audience as I crashed and burned. 

I wasn't very good at what I set out to do, and I wasn't even all that good in my ""consolation/plan B"" career either. I don't focus on things, but I agonize over everything. I am embarrassed almost constantly by how badly I managed my career and my life in my 20s and 30s. I'm no longer in any career, having been laid off and washed out. My one real goal in life never panned out, and it's too late (trust me, it is...both literally and financially.) I work shitty, low paying, part time jobs. 

When I'm not in a state of near catatonic depression, chances are I'm reminiscing, cringing and wishing for the chance to redo my past.

I would give almost anything to be able to have the optimism, hope, happiness, and excitement of my early 20s, before everything went to absolute shit. But I've lost all of that. I can identify nothing to help me regain it. I feel physically incapable of looking forward to anything.",04May2020,1

This is a serious academic book. I've looked at a few Reddit threads now about it, however, and they are pretty misinformed.

https:// www.reddit.com /r/redditrequest/comments/gcuem6/requesting_rpoiitics_community_set_to_private/   
  
They are trying to get the rights to the sub ""poiitics"" with two i's, so that people who mistype and such are redirected to their honey pot. it would read as ""poIitics""    
  
Here's some of my old notes:  
[Here’s what he does all day](https://i.redd.it/y16au1cphis41.png) post Republican talking points then tries to get people not to vote. The other mods of his sub, OurPresident, are just alt accounts of his.  
  
[Before this lrl guy was banned from politics he used to do shady shit on that sub too, which I documented here 3 months ago, and yes, reported to mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enough_Sanders_Spam/comments/ed0o76/a_sanders_supporter_that_does_michieveous_stuff/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=SubredditDrama&amp;utm_content=t1_fna5uwn) (see below for examples of their r politics rigging)  
  
/u/FThumb sent me an important note about OurPresident's bizzarely and clearly rigged upvoting, I’m posting with their permission:   
  
&gt;Because I mod another Bernie sub I should be more sympathetic to him, but he's running a karma farm. I also used to make repeated reports to admins over his blatant vote manipulations. It's always so damn obvious I even made a series of screen grabs starting with a 2 minute old post, every two minutes, showing that the upvotes were coming in many times faster than their Here Now traffic supported, knowing it would be another of his 20k upvote ""miracles."" https://imgur.com/a/iu7LOXK  
  
&gt;I shared this to admins along with other example of posts that rocketed to 10-20k upvotes while his traffic and surrounding posts never aligned with those numbers. I also showed where he held 121 of the top 125 posts. I know of others who have also tracked the blatant vote manipulation and tried to show admins, and I also know he was originally running that sub as u/ChickenPeak but was banned from reddit for vote manipulation, which is why his other ""mods"" are blank placeholder accounts in case he's banned again he can just resume with one of them.
Admins don't care, and I don't know why.
 
  
If anyone cares I found my notes of their manipulation that I sent to the politics mods. Why were they doing this? They would post old Bernie news the last day possible (politics had a rule that an article had to be within 30 days to post, which after this, maybe because of, they changed to I think 2 weeks). They were all suspiciously upvoted like all of lrlourpresidents stuff. The goal I think was to give Bernie good headlines even on days when he had none.  
  
They remove any positive talk of Joe Biden, and only post stuff basically trying to convince people not to vote. [How this kind of manipulation is being allowed to run amock here unchecked is beyond absurd](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/g0e3ma/rourpresident_mods_are_removing_any_comments_that/).

121,"I know that you guys are in the wrong. I gave you the benefit of the doubt, you are near the top of your profession. Just because you work at the best healthcare facility in the US dosnt mean you can’t make mistakes then cover them up. 

I’m not sure if you know this medical records are easy to look over in the world of technology. I have seen the notes saying that your diagnosis paired with the testing don’t line up. I saw the contributions the drug companies have donated for your research that line up with surprisingly well with the treatment you gave me. I find it odd you ramped up my treatment using one drug companies options which was followed by an increase in donations. 

I routinely expressed my concerns and ideas but you dismissed them. But what I said was wrong was based off your testing and you still dismissed it even when my symptoms lined up with that diagnosis. But that problem wouldn’t of been profitable, am I right? 

I have lost everything because of you. I had to drop out of college. I’m in massive debt. I haven’t been able to hold a job and that wrecked my career. I have suffered a heart attack and a stroke but you said it was rare and that stress was the reason. I tried to kill myself to end the pain. 
The constant pain. Stomach  ache and cramps. Muscle spasms.  Episodes of delirium. Lost of concentration. Seizures. Severe headaches. Chronic back pain. But you say it’s all in my head. The results showing organ failure, but yet still in my head. 
I gave you trust in my health but you took advantage of that. Maybe you made a mistake, it happens. But dismissing me isn’t how you handle that as you see me destroyed piece by piece. 
Well guess what? I have done my own research and I have been right. This severe diagnosis you gave me was actually something simple and minor. It “was” but now I could die. I can’t even get the help from you or anyone in that healthcare system. With COVID 19 I can’t get help anywhere. 
I might only be 22 but I’m not an idiot. You better hope I die because if I don’t, your career will. You have taken everything from me and now it’s time for me to take something from you.

123,"This is not a cry for help.

I often suicidally ideate, in fact I do it almost daily. Right now I am not planning to kill myself, at least right now, I see what happens to others and I myself have been affected by it as well. One day something might push me over the edge, but for now I just feel like I want to almost every day.

A little bit about me: I have Bipolar 1 disorder. This has caused me great pain in my life. For those who do not know about the difference between Bipolar 1&amp;2 let me educate you. Bipolar 1 leads to mood swings greater than any other mood disorder, one day I might feel like everything is mostly ok and others I am at the precipice of despair. But even worse than that is Mania and Depressive episodes. These entail me either going insane through extreme actions like spending all my money, going out and believing I am a prophet, disregarding all logic and just in general going insane. On the flip side I get so depressed that I cannot move or think and vegetate in one place for months on end. These episodes vary in length and I always come out worse than ever.

To say that this has affected my life is an understatement. Looking back all that I see is misery, missed opportunities and broken relationships. Much of this has come as a result of my disease, but a lot of it is also that I am in general just not a great person. Looking forward then I see very little hope for a bright future. I am almost 30 now and every time my life has seemed like it is turning out for the better I either become so insane that people leave me and I wreck my life OR I become so depressed that I distance myself from everything and everyone.

There is no cure for this disease. I will have to suffer it until I die. There is no stopping it. Some might say ""oh get treatment"". And I have, right now I am on a med regimen and while it ""helps"" it also cripples my body and mind to not feel, to just stay sane ""enough"". I have often gone off of meds because of this, there is no winning. Either I get to feel alive and risk the consequences of my insanity OR I am on meds which make my life a great big nothing. I mean, afterall, I am still suicidal even though I am on these pills.

Not seeing much hope. I have noticed that at least a 1/3 of my life has gone by (if I'm lucky only 1/2 or less). So if I'm not going to kill myself? Well I cannot wait to die then.

I'm so glad this is not forever, some might feel like they wish they could stay forever, that they would never die. Myself though, I cannot wait for that final day when I can finally escape this world of pain and sin. I long for it, I dream of it. No longer will I be tormented by this disease, no longer can I hurt others, no longer will I have to desire, feel pain and this despair I feel constantly in my life.

I am convinced there is no hope. Any time I have put my faith in it, it has always been a lie. Whatever good thing happens always dissapears. Friends leave, family abandons you and my life gets worse. Right now I am sitting here so scarred, and I am of course afraid of what the years ahead will bring me. But my one comfort is that I eventually will go.

I know I'm not alone in thinking this. But I wanted to get this out there. Afterall, I can't risk sharing this in real life because it would burden others and leave me in the hospital.

Mom and I moved out. We lived in a tiny apartment for one year and now my mom purchased her own home that we’ve been in for almost a year. 
I’m really happy about it but sometimes I feel weird or like a failure for not being out on my own. It’s not that I can’t move out, I make a salary respectable enough to live on my own I just don’t see the benefit to it. 
Also I’m not a bum, I do pay rent to my mom but it’s still cheaper living with her than moving out. We used to fight a lot before the divorce but after moving out we became extremely close and are best friends and supportive of each other. 
I’m really happy to be in a quiet and peaceful home that I haven’t had for years and I enjoy her company. Mom is a hippie boomer and doesn’t have any rules in place for me like curfews or not allowing guests over. Of course I don’t really do anything to warrant restrictive rules (I’m introverted and hate leaving the house). 
She feels guilty that she has to charge me rent otherwise she wouldn’t be able to pay the mortgage but I’m happy to contribute and would hate to feel like a leech. I would pick my mom as a roommate versus other people any day.

But no one tells you about the other stuff, the real and practical stuff, like how to work from home when you have spotty wifi. No one tells you how to manage the loneliness you feel when you can’t see your friends, or go home and kiss your mom.

And definitely, most definitely, no one tells you what to do after you’ve confessed your love to your roommate in the middle of a quarantine.

Hell, at least no one told me. 

Though, in hindsight, I probably should have figured out that was bad idea beforehand. 

My roommate is my best friend. We’ve lived together for two years and spent the last seven answering the question, “Are you guys together?” For years we answered, “Hahahah NO! We are JUST friends, God why can’t anyone believe a man and woman can be best friends” Then we’d tell the story of how we tried to date in 2013 and it lasted one month, ending with a conversation that went something to the effect of both of us saying “I love you but I don’t want to kiss you.” We mutually decided that we were better off as friends. 

That’s how it had been for years. We didn’t want to kiss each other, it wasn’t like that at all. Not-to mention, I lived with the guy, I heard all his farts, saw crumbs in his beard, knew how long he took to take a shit. Not exactly the makings of a love story.  

Then a few months ago, pre-pandemic, something started to change. We were out one night and some shit went down at the bar we were at that led to us having to call an ambulance for a stranger at 2am. It was a traumatizing ordeal and as our own Uber came to take us home, I unconsciously grabbed his hand in solidarity. As I was holding it, I thought to myself, “There’s no one else I’d rather be with right now” And it occurred to me, that was true in so many situations.  

Then, gradually, I started seeing him differently. Instead of being grossed out by the crumbs in his beard, I wanted to wipe them away. Instead of laughing at his dating escapades, I was jealous. I talked myself in and out of it, for months. Some days the thought of us together was laughable, and other days I could see it so clearly. Until finally the days where I imagined us together were more frequent than the other days. 

So I said something. What could possibly go wrong?  It had all the makings of a classic Romcom. 

Except that’s not how it went down, because as much as I want it to be, life isn’t always a Nicholas Sparks novel. Real life is more complicated than that.

As it turned out, when we had dated the first time, the breakup wasn’t as mutual as I thought. He recalled times when he tried to kiss me and I pulled away, times when he tried to hold my hand and I avoided his touch.  We took some time away from each other and when we became friends again, he said he had basically taught his body not to respond to me and that I was “only his friend” and that’s still how he saw me.

Of course I wanted to defend myself, “But I was young and stupid! I had lessons to learn! We were different people” But I stayed quiet and listened because what’s done is done and I couldn’t take any of that back. 

Then the quarantine happened.  

And we rehashed the conversation, again and again. I kept thinking that maybe, I don’t know, if he understood that I was all in the pool this time, he’d get in with me.

But he couldn’t. Wouldn’t. No matter how much he loved me, ultimately he didn’t see me that way anymore, and he didn’t think he could mentally cross that bridge. Or in other terms, he didn’t want to have sex with me. Ouch.  

We were never on the same page at the same time. 

Some days we were fine, great even. He handled everything kindly and compassionately in a way that made it impossible to be mad at him. We’d have conversations for hours and watch movies. We’d hang out like we always had. And some days an unknown number with a flirtatious text would pop up on his phone during a call with our friend and the sadness would fall over me like a rainstorm. 

I needed space. Time to heal. Time to reconcile that my fantasy of us, was just that, a fantasy.  

The only problem? 

We both are Covid +, so all of this was going on amidst weeks of fatigue and fevering.  

Even if I wanted to leave, I can’t. 

SO here I am, writing this Reddit post and trying to grieve, ten feet away from cause. Embarrassed and crying as quietly as I can while he’s on the other side of the wall having a zoom date with some girl he just met.",04May2020,1
140,"Idk if this is just a quarantine thing. I'm not in a relationship or anything.

It's weird because I can still tell who's like ""conventionally attractive"" and who isn't.

But I literally feel no different looking at any of them, like watching TV. (and I'm in britain so they don't just put attractive people on TV lmao they put everyone.)   


Maybe it's because I'm not seeing people in real life anymore?",04May2020,1
141,"I don't know why people have this idea that their shitty personal health and inability to take care of themselves means that the rest of the world should stop operating. Bad news bears, pumpkin. You're not special. You're sickly and just like before the quarantine, you get no favors. Nobody owes you anything and you should take that bitter pill in addition to the rest of your meds to come to the realization sooner rather than later.",04May2020,1
143,"September or so of last year my gf brought home a tiny little munchkin cat without asking me. I was livid, but with time I grew attached. As I grew he stayed the same size.

He was always so small he could barely climb anywhere and rarely did he try to jump. Last Thursday we noticed he couldn't use the bathroom, so we took him to the vet. They drained his bladder and found the start of bladder stones so cleaned him out. We got him back on Saturday and he was more lively than we ever saw him. Trying to jump and super excited to be around us. Saturday he was back to being unable to bathroom and wanted nothing but sleep. We took him to the emergency vet and he was reconstructed and had a full colon. They did everything they could, but I guess he had an infection. He passed away about 30 minutes ago. Me and my girlfriend are crying and locked in another room because we're baby sitting and don't want the kids we're watching to see us cry.

Thanks for listening",04May2020,1
