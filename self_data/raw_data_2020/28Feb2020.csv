1,"It's middle of the night and here I am, sitting and sipping warm chamomile tea with honey. The medicine I have doesn't do anything and I need to buy something else but I'm going to be a zombie if I won't get more sleep. I also sound weird when I talk, oh how I hate being sick. I probably need to cancel my meeting with friends and work. 
Also I don't want to go to visit a doctor. I hate doctors.",28Feb2020,1
3,I was with my psychiatrist today a couple of hours ago and we were having a very nice conversation but I was acting a bit out of character. I was being overly talkative. I noticed this and abruptly stopped talking right in the middle of a sentence. I'm two weeks into quitting smoking and I've lost 60 pounds on my diet so I do have a lot more energy. After a few moments I apologized for talking so much and he said that I wasn't and that it was OK. I then let him get to work sorting my meds out. I as usual began to notice something. I always notice things. I was going to town on some chewing gum. And he was tapping his foot and my chewing and his tapping were aligning rhythmically. I did everything I could to not let that happen. I suffer from paranoia among my many symptoms and I was concerned he was tapping his foot to the rhythm of my chewing on purpose and after about 3 or 4 minutes I said to myself let me bring this up to my psychiatrist so I did. I talked at length about the things I notice and how I know they are real and not a hallucination. I know because I've had hallucinations before. After explaining my frustration with having to notice this behavior between me and others and how it drives me nuts he asked if I had ever been diagnosed with OCD and I said no and he said that that is what that is. He said what I notice is normal and He has it to a degree himself! I just wanted to get it out there that I now have an answer to a question I've had for many years. I am grateful! Thanks for reading of my success.,28Feb2020,1
7,"Sure, maybe it's because I'm sick and the idea of smoking or drinking anything is hugely unappealing right now .. but I can't help but be really excited.

To be clear I never abused any drugs to begin with but it's just nice knowing that I don't need to drink coffee every day or chainsmoke/vape to feel normal.",28Feb2020,1
8,The last 6 years felt like one big blob of indistinguishable bullshit. The last three is just one big shadow like an eraser over pencil on paper. It did not help that I was drunk for most of it either. I’ve been getting sober and healthy these past few months but tomorrow my dads in town to meet my SO. Ask me earlier today and I would’ve told you no big deal. I don’t know why but I guess that’s a lie otherwise why did I get drunk tonight. It’s funny how I feel fine about something but as soon as I get home I start drinking. I’m so suppressed I don’t even know why I’m bothered but I still resort to old habits. Denial is a helluva drug and it tastes like Cabernet Sauvignon tonight.,28Feb2020,1
9,"I’m a boy (14) and my sister is 12. For the past year or so my sister has gotten into arguments with my parents almost every day over almost everything. The arguments aren’t too extreme, but the stress has been piling up on my sister. She has been going to a therapist for a few months now, which I don’t know much about, but she says she doesn’t really like therapy. She also has been taking some pills to help her for the past few days. My brother who is now 17 also is is making things worse for her, as he still very immature and has his own problems, but that’s a whole different topic. He ends up bothering her a lot and getting her more frustrated. We have a pretty small house and unavoidably have to be near each other a lot throughout the day. Today, I tried to talk to my sister about all of this, but I’m not really good at this type of stuff and am kind of a quiet person. I really tried helping her, but it didn’t seem to work at all and I don’t know what to do at this point. She mentioned she has been having suicidal thoughts, has cut herself, and wants to run away. Just to clear things up, my parents don’t physically abuse any of us, they used to hit my brother and I a while ago but they’ve long stopped. I think of myself as a somewhat intelligent individual but when I talk to my sister it seems like she just doesn’t understand anything I’m saying and everything goes over her head. I used to get extremely mad about my parents as well a few years back but now I do love them a lot. I don’t think she has matured enough to understand everything they’ve done for us. Of course my parents have their faults and I think they can be better at parenting in multiple ways but they have good intentions. I would talk to my parents about this instead of Reddit, but one thing they do is always think they’re right and don’t listen to our opinions sometimes. I want to help my sister and don’t want her to regret anything she may do, so if I can get some suggestions that would be nice.",28Feb2020,1
10,"the charge is a check fraud charge and it is a seven month sentence. My daughter she seems to be handling it fine. I told her right away about it and she reacted pretty calmly. I told her mom did the wrong thing and is rightfully serving her punishment. They have a good relationship. The main problem I have is she will see her mom in a jail jumpsuit and see guards and other inmates that could be intimidating. I've talked to three people about whether I should bring my daughter, my wife, someone who works at the jail, and my daughter herself. Shockingly, they all said they would be in favor of bringing her but I am not sure I should follow their advice my wife says bring her if she would like to come but don't if she doesn't want to. I would think she would say don't bring her at all which is shocking. Still my wife is the one that will be there and will be used to the environment so obviously she may not be right in this instance I talked to my 15 year old daughter about it of course and she says she would like to go .Actually my daughter does not seem scared but instead seems excited and enthusiastic to visit. This is strange to me. Do you find this normal? My daughter seems to find the idea of her mom having to wearing a uniform, sharing a room a little funny. Since my daughter is young though she probably won't immediately know what is the right thing to do and I talked to the person that worked at the jail, she said that since my daughter is a teenagers it is perfectly fine to take her. She also said use it as a learning experience (what does that mean do you think), ask your wife to be honest about what happened, and to simply present it as a punishment for wrong doing. What do you think about That. You could the guard probably wants to scare kids though She hasn't gone yet so we can still discuss it together ​",28Feb2020,1
11,"Of course I dont want to tell her ANY of this but I need to say it. I feel like a stereotypical wanderer character if they were a male. 

I've been friends with this person for years and I really fell for them hard. When I told her, she reacted pretty well to it and I felt relieved (big thanks to relationship_advice for thata). But she's recently met someone who she's in a relationship with and I hate it. I thought maybe this was the time to break the cycle of meeting someone I start to develop romantic feelings for and them finding someone else or just flat out not liking me. For me, I was hoping this would finally be my time, but it turns out Iose again. 

I want to be supportive of her new relationship, even if it is with some anonymous stranger on the internet, but I feel bad saying that I want her to leave this person for me. I wanted her to be mine, but it looks like that won't happen

I don't want to be this controlling, but this keeps happening with all the potential love interests I meet. But as long as I can still have her in my life, I'll be fine. Not necessarily happy, but I'll be fine.",28Feb2020,1

13,"I've been very depressed this past year, floating in between jobs and living in my car. 

I spent another day wandering around aimlessly and went back to the car to further make my plans for my demise. I have been planning to off myself for a good month now. 

But something weird happened today. When I got in the car, I looked up at the sky and saw the sunset. It was like it hit me all at once. The Wonder of it, the beauty. 

It was like for once in my fucking life I finally understood what I'd be leaving behind. I finally understood that me being in this car doesn't take away the beauty of the world around me. I sat staring at that sunset until it disappeared behind the mountain with tears going down my face. 

I don't have much, I never really did have much, but one thing I do have is the sunset. It made me realize that even though I'm at a rock bottom I still have something to hold onto. 

The sadness isn't gone, but I made a choice today, and that choice was to hold onto the sunset",28Feb2020,1

January was a good month: although I didn't do so much about my college project, was the first month in my life I was in a good mood and relaxing for some time. But now I'm addicted to reddit and youtube, and doing just a little of my project.

So I thought that was a good idea postpone the end of my college, get some job, live alone and dealing with things that will come. I'm young (21 years old) and in a terrible mood to get out of my house. I need a place to be quiet, exerciting more, get more privacy and stuff.",28Feb2020,1
16,"I am so alone. No friends, no bf, no job and I still haven’t finished school. No money so I can’t leave this situation. I feel so disconnected from my parents. I feel like they team up against me. I’ve been noticing that my dad doesn’t really like me. He only tries to have a relationship with me for my mom. When he’s mad at her he’s mad at me too. When they were fighting he’d say I’d stay with him just to spite her smh. I don’t feel like my mom is a good mother. I see how other mothers will sacrifice so much just so their kid has a better life, and I don’t see her ever trying that. One of the reasons I never committed suicide was so I wouldn’t traumatize her when she’d find my body. But honestly she never stands up for me against my dad and other people, &amp; has failed at things a mother should do. So why should I care about her feelings? Honestly I’m too scared to do it, but I really feel like it would solve so many problems.

17,"Yes, it is bad news, and Im kind of internally freaking out, but, she made up her own information and started telling some of our family.

Shes been battling ovarian cancer for about a year now, and recently had fluid removed from the lining of her lungs. They tested it and found the cells in it were malignant. The doctor/nurses arent telling her ""how long she has left"" because no body knows that. What my mom did, however, was read up about it online, and got some random number: 4 months. Shes told me and a few other people she has 4 months to live. Im trying to think rationally. I told her just to keep doing treatment, and we'll see how things progress. I told her its silly to get a timeline from the internet and to stop telling people she has 4 months, and she kind of sheepishly agreed. 


Fuck. Last week we were told she was getting better (the chemo was working) and now, what? Its spreading? My mom has this attitude that shes lived a good life and just wants to enjoy what she has left. Whats that supposed to mean, that shes just going to give in?",28Feb2020,1

21,"I always knew my mother's parenting was not normal but I never realized how much it would affect me into my adulthood. The things she taught me, the ways she controlled me, and her manipulation have destroyed my mental health and have made me so goddamn confused about relationships, morality, and life in general. I am 20 now, working my ass off to become 100% financially independent so I can no longer be controlled in any way. Trying to find my own way in life. But everyday I feel constant guilt for distancing myself from her because I love her so much, despite what she has put me through, and I never want her to hurt. The guilt never stops. I feel it every second. Even though I know she hurts me, I can't stop thinking of the good in her and I just feel so much pain. On top of the guilt, I feel resentment because I don't understand why things needed to be this way. I can't stop thinking about my childhood innocence that was destroyed too soon.

It's so hard to get up, go to work, and do what I need to do everyday when all of this is going on in my life and in my head. It feels like I have no one to talk to because my friends don't understand and I am desperately trying to find an affordable therapist who will accept me as a client.

23,"I used to think I could only show people their ugliness but now I can show them their beauty too

This was inspired by a dream I just had or at least a very small part of it, since there was waaay too much going in there; that’ll take over an hour to type.
edit after finishing: took me almost an hour writing this. 

I’ll start by getting straight to point, and adding appendages after.

TLDR version is: Part of dream was about cursed lady who’s still cursed but can use her curse for good. I was an asshole who used honesty as an excuse; now I’m not. 


Occasionally, we’d run into people who are blatantly rude/hurtful, whom do it under the guise of honesty, and for a long time, I was that way [though I’ve always been careful not to twist the knife]. I believe that that is a childish sorry excuse made to mask social incompetence or insecurities, mostly seen in adolescents, and often adults (reasons vary) either because of bitterness, or arrogance etc. Eitherway, there’s a good likelihood that their personality isn’t well integrated. 

Dream: feel free to skip

So in the dream there was a woman in a small village or camp where “different” people gather, and her mother works in a tent there (a salon or something). The woman is cursed that every mirror she holds to others or photo will turn their reflection to an ugly ghoulish being, with black tar covering the reflection and sometimes the beings in the reflections will seep into reality. i.e. she’ll see them that way. 
I mentioned her mother worked in a tent there, but the girl didn’t know her as she had come back to town just recently after long travel,and her mother, (whom she/I only figured out who she is much later in the dream), appeared to her as a pale old hag with a face so wrinkly it seemed to be melting and a hollow for an eye socket on one side 

During a huge commotion in the camp, her mother tried approaching her to tell her who she is, but she refused to believe such a beast was her mother, and started crying. Until she raised a mirror to someone, and their reflection instead of a tar tainted monster, turned into a beautiful reflection of who they actually were/how they looked, with streaks of black around the borders around  the warm coloured reflections that took shape and stayed on the mirror. She then did so again to another stranger and it was the same, until she did that to her mother and she turned back to her original form. 

The girl had learned to use her curse not show the monster that others were, but the beauty of them. It was still tinged with darkness, nevertheless it was beautiful. 


Getting to the point: 

I’ve met many people of all sorts throughout my life, and I think it’s part of why I developed good intuition towards people’s personalities and emotions, or at least expressions. But I’ve always and still struggle with giving compliments. My compliments are always just statements—me stating what I see in them, anything else comes off as me trying too hard, I get asked to take a rest (figuratively speaking).

Over the years I got better at speaking to others, now I’m actually liked for honesty, and people are often happy when I give a compliment because they know I’m honest. 

It takes effort to deliver criticism or reply on insults  without sounding belligerent and blowing their face off the planet or too apologetic, but I seem to have gotten the hang of it, since it’s been a while since I made someone cry or hold an eternal grudge, that they remind me of every time they see me for the next 4-6 years

 *ahem* getting back to topic 

I starting interning in a nearby country, and many people seem to like me (I think). I change departments often, and I get stopped all time by employees from previous departments just to check on me real quick and say hi, or if we’re free, we chat a bit. I also get told less that I look like I just murdered/ want to murder someone, but that’s an issue for another day.  

I’m happy with the progress I made, and I’m still continuously trying to improve. I hope I do.

28,"(apologize in advance for poor grammar but i just wanna get it out) 
PREFACE: bf and i broke up on valentine’s day. still live together out of necessity, and we have a cat, whom we’ve agreed I’ll be taking.
breakup was not out of the blue, we’ve had prolonged heavy issues, both personally and with one another, which we’ve tried and failed to work through healthily. 


NOW: Living together just is not working out, though I’m on the couch and he’s in another room with a closed door. Being available to shoulder emotional baggage of his pertaining to the breakup is draining. Finally cutting my last tie to him on valentine’s day after another erosive argument was draining. Trying to move on has been draining. 

Anyway, tonight he tried to initiate an argument from the start after not knowing where I was all last night/today until 5pm. I get it. Shit hurts and comes in waves of difficulty.  But he got especially upset about the fact that I wanted to be friends/maintain civility, yet didn’t tell him where I went and also removed him from my followers on a personal instagram account (which i basically use as support from peers/to let them know when shit goes down that wouldn’t be appropriate for a normal following). I talked about how i felt about the breakup and especially my moving on there. It was in an effort to spare his feelings and protect my own. 

FUTURE: He makes just enough to cover his own bills (phone, credit, loan) but cannot at all afford a place of his own. Every bill from our apartment comes out of my bank account. I can’t live with him anymore. It’s prohibiting both of us from *really* moving on. Just tonight he said he’d been holding out hope, when i’ve told him several times outright that he shouldn’t be. 

I don’t feel morally sane making him move. I’d be pushing him to practical homelessness. However, our cat is mine and so is this apartment. I’m really not trying to move temporarily just to have 2 rent bills to keep him comfortable. 

I do recognize that he needs to learn to stand on his own two feet as an adult, but it’s something he’s done before. I think he had gotten very comfortable being taken care of, alongside developing a deeper depression regarding his self worth/how his family treated him. 

But how do I proceed? I respect him and his feelings, though I *know* he believes otherwise. I want the best for myself foremost, but i don’t want to hurt him in my bloom. Our relationship was a massive weight on my back, objectively. I do feel more free, and happier in some ways already.

I'm getting into the career field I've always wanted, I've gotten a chance to get some time off to study for school with working part time because my boyfriend is really sweet and wants the best for me. My parents support me (mentally) and grandparents too because I'll be the first to graduate college. I just got on some really good depression meds a few months ago that have done wonders for actually getting me out of bed.

But I can't help but think everything is going in the shitter. So much of the time I can't think what's the point of everything. I think my boyfriend is reaching his limit on dealing with my cynasisam. He doesn't get why I can't see the good in things. Usually I can see the good in people, but I don't get my hopes up because the people I count on most have always let me down for the most part. I've reached the point where I'd rather be happily surprised when things go the way I hoped, but I always automatically think it will be the worst just to prepare myself. 

I had a bit of a religious breakthrough a few nights ago, where I talked to a god I had never believed in. I looked at the sky and talked to it for 2 straight hours trying to explain everything I felt and everything I'm trying to do to be a good person. I felt like he/she/whatever understood. I had never felt so... Relieved? Understood? Accepted? 

I never got a response, but there was a weird relief. I've recently felt proud for everything I've been trying to do, but now I feel like nothing is going to be okay after all. I don't know how I felt so sure, to feeling like I needed to question everything. I just want to have reassurance that I'm doing what I need to do. I'm working towards being a paramedic, it's the only thing I ever felt I was meant for. 

I've been working in the ER as a tech for 4 years,  I guess I could easily(ish) transition to a nurse. But I think I could have the talent to being a paramedic. I don't know if that will work out as I hope, but I know I want it more than anything, and as hard as a job as I know it can be, I feel like I was meant for it. But what if I start this job, and suddenly lose all meaningfulness with it too? I'm tired of feeling inadequate. I'm tried of holding others to my standards (because obviously I'm not even good enough to hold them up). 

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm dangerously on the edge of doing something stupid because I feel like I'll always feel like nothing is really worth anything no matter how hard I work.

I know it's only the first week but I'm scared that I won't meet anyone or will just be miserable here and have to start over again.

I'm trying to be strong, I stay busy all day but I just have a lot of anxiety and am really sad honestly. I miss my family and my pets, besides my dog who came here with me.",28Feb2020,1

39,"I have to wake up every morning and get tormented by the thoughts in my head.
Telling me my boyfriend doesn't really love me, is unattracted to me, is sick of me, he finds me annoying etc.
I have to go put on makeup because my day is ruined if i go outside without any on, people will see how ugly i am and treat me how ugly people get treated nowadays.
I go to work and just know im getting compared to every beautiful girl that works with me, people probably make fun of me because i look like a man trying to dress up as a woman.
The only thing that makes it better sometimes is my boyfriend. 
I go home and we watch something or talk about my day.
I used to have a moderate/high libido but its gone lately. And every time i try to do anything with him my mind convinces me im not enough for him because im not like the girls in porn i don't have a nice body like they do, i cant constantly shove 7-8 inches down my throat for an hour like they can and i feel he gets annoyed because im not like them, i can't cum from penetration either and i know it annoys him.

These thoughts are ruining every moment i live.

Self harm is the only thing that helps and every time i get guilt tripped by someone for it. For doing what helps me cope with the searing thoughts in my head.
I want to stay alone and live alone for a week just to have a break from constantly wondering why mh boyfriend is even with me, why he even bothers with me.

I want therapy so so so fucking bad but i dont want to spend thousands on something that might not even work. Thousands of dollars just for someone to tell me what i already know. Thousands of dollars just to be made to relive all the memories id rather forget. I'd rather spend that on plastic surgery and actually know for once that im worth being loved , that i actually am attractive. 

All i think about sometimes is that im not enough for him.
I want to fucking die and rid myself of this existing in a world that fucking hates me.

I hate this
I hate being forced to just go to work everyday and live through the pain just hoping it will go away

I want it to end but i can't even do that, every time i try tell someone they just say ""you want to leave me all alone?"" ""what about your family"" ""what about me""

""it will get better""
I've been telling myself this for 14 fucking years, IT DOES NOT GET BETTER. And if it does, it lasts a few months at most. It will never get better. The moment it finally gets better, and permenantly, is when i leave this place.

All people really want on this earth is to be loved and to be happy.

Its so hard to feel loved when your whole life your friends, family, movies , media have told you you are not good enough and you need x, y and z to be loved. That if i ever find a man that loves me he will leave me for a better woman the moment she comes along.

I try to be the best, i try, i try... 
But i know i never will be. And no matter what i do, he's gonna fucking leave me. 
And it's been a year. It's going to happen any moment now.

And when that happens, ill realize life wasn't worth living in the first place, and ill fucking end it all.

Ever since the middle of the 2 and a half month break I found myself losing focus and sharpness. I used to be able to come up with witty stuff on the spot whilst having a clear mind. Nowadays I feel like I’m just floating around with nothing that really goes through my head, I have completely lost my presence of mind. 
Not to mention, I get bored Super easily now. I would try and watch a show or something and 15 minutes later I’d find myself disinterested and completely forgot what had happened in the show.

I had attributed this to not stimulating my mind enough during the 2 and a half month break but I’m not sure if that’s the reason for this. Another example of this would be when I’m attending a lecture and whatever the lecturer says will go in through one ear and out the other ear almost instantly. 

Talking to people has been tough too. When people come up to me and try to talk to me I can usually think of a decent response but that hasn’t been the case at all recently.

48,"I recently got out of a five year relationship where I felt completely alone for the final two years. I moved from my city for her, I had no friends there and I stupidly never tried to make any. I relied on her fully for my social needs to be met. She had an active social life, a lot of friends, went to a lot of parties and no matter how much I asked if I could come too, there was always an excuse to keep me away. We used to watch movies together, read together, go on dates, we didn't do anything like that for the last year we were together. I felt completely alone and unwanted, living with a person that used to love me, a person that was giving me nothing and my response was to keep trying to do more and more for her in the hope that I would get something back, even if it was just a hug every now and again. 

I should have left her, but I didn't have the balls. I knew that right now I am occasionally getting something back, a bit of human contact, sometimes we would talk, sex once every few weeks that used to have emotion and now felt purely physical. For some reason I felt like having just that tiny bit was better than nothing. 

About two months ago she left me suddenly, she met someone else and moved out with him. Now I am alone in this city where I don't know anyone, I don't have anyone to talk with, but somehow I feel less lonely than I did with her. Before I was lonely when I shouldn't be and I couldn't find a way to fix it, now I'm lonely because I am alone and that feels right.

I'm super excited to learn to love myself, build up a strong social circle, casual sex and going on dates and eventually finding someone to love who really loves me back. I'm going to take it nice and slow, there's no time pressure, it's all about me now. 

I have a lot of hope for the future, breaking up was the best thing to happen to me and I hope that maybe this story will help others that are feeling the same way.

49,"I got the ""number one"" high school in my country, I was grateful for that, I think. A lot of the students here are exceptional, some at academics, while others at their social abilities becoming a ""leader"", etc. Now I'm in my second year now and in July I'll be a third year student. Looking back now to what I have achieved since a first year student and comparing them to my friends make me sad and disappointed. 

**First year starts.**

Here, academics is almost everything in the schools eyes, especially science olympiad, and the speed of teaching the curriculum is 2x of normal school. I can't keep up. I tried so hard to study for the test, remembering some nights I sacrificed and when I saw my results I almost cried. I keep failing most of my tests. Remembering back in elementary and junior high I almost never fail a test and some teachers even classified me as the smart ones. But here, here is a different story. 

**First year ends. Second year starts.**

This is where I thought maybe I am just good at something else like sports or maybe joining the students council. Then I Joined the basketball team, it was doing well I did quite good and I did participate in a basketball competition as the main team. I thought woah this is doing well, I started to feel proud of myself. Then the month of the election of the new candidates for the students council, so I applied but then I failed, despite my efforts. I was sad and disappointed again but I carried on. 

A tragedy happened 3-4 months after joining the team, I broke my right arm during practice. I was shocked, I got into a hospital and doctor said the full recovery needs 6 months. After 1 week of resting, I insisted to go back to school, afraid that I couldn't catch up with the lessons. Having unable to write with my right arm made me fail a lot of test due to hard for me to study. 

**Present (4 months after arm injury)**  
Looking back now made me feel sad. I am not well known in school, my grades barely shines, I still can't play sports, my underclassmen barely know me. I lack of motivation, at first watching my friends shining bright it inspires me, but now it's kind of breaking me apart a little.

[Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/f200oo/this_is_me/) a pic of me if you’re good at drawing.

Being a 32 year old virgin really took its toll on my mental health and my self-esteem, but I’ve always refused to pay for sex, preferring to wait for someone I cared about.

Well, recently a girl I asked out (23f) suggested a friend-with-benefits relationship. I was a bit hesitant at first because I’d been holding out for a girlfriend for so long, but I thought why not? And it was AMAZING! The feeling of sexual intimacy with another person was overwhelming!

And the best part was she said afterwards, “I’d never have known you were a virgin, you’re more attentive than most guys I’ve been with. You make love like a lesbian!” I was taken aback at that last part but apparently it was meant as a huge compliment! This is probably because it was all very gentle and romantic. I stroked her face and hair a lot and told her she was beautiful.

This was a month ago and since then we’ve met up often, and I even have ANOTHER FwB (19f) so obviously I’m giving off different vibes now! Don’t worry, I’m taking precautions.

53,"hey guys,

lately smthn scary has been happening. i don't know what it is or how to get rid of it or what the cause is, if any.

so basically I've been waking up an hour earlier than i usually do, thinking that im late for school or work when really, it starts the next hour. Example. A few weeks ago I literally thought I had work at 7am when it was actually at 8am. Now i had waken up at 7:04am and I PANICKED. I was crying cuz I thought I was going to get fired (i was on probation at the time so i couldve easily been fired). I put on my uniform, brushed my teeth, etc. all the while panicking and crying. and i kid u not, AS SOON as I got downstairs it suddenly hit me hard that I had work at 8, not 7! i started crying even more bc of my relief.

the second time this happened was today. I have a class at 8:30am and i usually leave an hour and a half early, so in this case 7. I woke up at 5:45 (and I even SAW the time on my phone and I STILL thought I was late). anyways same as b4, I rushed to put on my clothes, etc. and as soon as I got down i ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH WITH IT and put on my jacket and rushed out the door. I was wondering why it was so dark at (what i thought was) 7am. I got to the bus station and i actually GOT ON the bus, AND THEN i realized it was 6:18am, not 7:18. I was like ""oh no, not again!"" 

why does this keep happening?? Is it lack of water? cuz im horrible at staying hydrated. i really hope its that and not smthn more serious. any ideas as to what this is??

57," 

I have no friends in real life to talk too, so this will be my farewell letter.

I have been alone for my entire life. I never had a girlfriend. I took advice from both the internet and actual therapists, clothing, haircut, keeping fit, joining clubs based around activities that interest me, you  know the drill. I'm not disliked at all, people that have to sit next to me in school/at work have no problem with me. But the moment agenda doesn't put us in the same room, people forget me, be it the people from school, clubs, work. I'm just not interesting enough to make people wish to continue talking to me, be it as friends or anything else, to  them I'm just a secondary character in the background, and by now I agree with it.

My 30th birthday was some time ago, I'm not even sure why I didn't do it as I promised myself, self-preservation instinct I guess. I promised to myself when I was 21/22 that I would try what there is to try to get out of my  loneliness, with 30 as a time limit. I feel like I'm the same lost kid that didn't knew how to make friends, lagging so far behind on basic human skills that I'm a manchild that can't really understand when adults talk about aspects of their lives.

I know 30 is supposed to be young. I was told at 17 that I was young and still had time, same as 22, same as 27. I never felt young. I feel like I've been trying to do something out of my youth for 30 years and  failing at it. I have no memories of outings with friends or destinations that made me wonder. I traveled a lot, went out to events  that interested me, watched the stars in forgotten places with no lights around. I did all of this alone, and it wasn't worth it. I feel tired, not young, the same I felt at 17, 22 and all the subsequent years. I gave it time as I was advised ""you're young, you'll find  someone/friends"". I gave it more than a decade, and after a while it just feels old.

30 years sounds like the good time limit to me, a good point to look back upon your life and think about what has been done and what to do next and enough experience under the belt to know a bit better who you are, what you are  and what you can do. Having spent them alone, it's a fair conclusion  that it's not going to change in the next decade or afterwards. At my best form and with the most positive attitude I had, I never managed get a meaningful relationship with someone, be it as friend or more. Most people my age know better what they want in love, are married or divorced, have kids or are planning to do so, the usual. I'm lagging  behind, I don't know the first thing about relationships and I doubt that someone knowing what they're looking for is going to bother with the bumbling steps of a manchild.

I grew up and missed a basic part of the human condition, and it has gone for long enough. Living life lonely is not worth it. It wasn't a few  years back, it isn't now, the only difference is I feel I should have  spared myself the torture of the previous years, when I still had hope. So I filled the void with anything I could find, work, writing a lot, reading, sports, whatever. But it just doesn't act as a crutch anymore.

My social life is empty. I did most activities alone, and after a while of not being able to share it with anyone, it just hurts.

My artistical life is empty. I wrote a lot and took courses since I was 15, but I barely got any better.

My professional life is about the only thing I managed well, I build prosthesis/orthesis for amputated/disabled people, it pays well and  there's no shortage of work and at least it's useful. That's the one thing I managed. In 30 years of life, I managed to have a good job. And  that's it.

Enough is enough, I'm calling it quits. I researched the methods and have been practising one that fits me. I don't want to suffer for another decade just for a slight chance of sharing a meaningful moment with someone.

If I can wish you one thing: be foolish, make some mistakes, doesn't need to be extreme stuff, just get out of your comfort zone to have some good or wacky memories to have something to tell about your life, lest you end like me and wonder what you've done in all these years.",28Feb2020,1

***

Things started going downhill since I was thirteen.

The only other notable event of opposition before then, was at the age of five, when I was homeless and had to give up my dog. Keep in mind, it was only my parents and I. I don't have siblings or other family members active in my life.

My parents had substance abuse.

I realized how little my other relatives cared.

My father was diagnosed with epilepsy and schizo-effective disorder.

Both my parents have anxiety and depression disorders.

I was never included in friend groups I tried entering into.

I started getting sleep paralysis and night terrors (more on that later).

Overall, I just started struggling with life at that age. I even started showing symptoms of anxiety and depression, myself.

I slipped into isolation, that slowly turned into agoraphobia.

My parents almost divorced, and my only form of comfort were in my pet dogs. Which, like all life, eventually must pass. I could tell you now, that my grief for such losses, felt like losing my very soul.

I've suffered from many nightmares with demonic presences. I've felt sensations of slithering or crawling across my back. I've seen many creatures; some in black hoods, some bat-esque, and creatures covered in thick fur, bipedal, black wolves, and a disembodied eyeball.

Thing is, none of those creatures or dreams are reoccurring. There's always something new, whether it's a form, a voice, or a sensation.

I've talked to others, namely: therapists, friends, and a psychiatrist. Almost all of them seem to think it's linked to some form of schizophrenia, probably inherited by my father. But, I never had excessive paranoia, only the occasional amount most people may have. I don't have any auditory or visual hallucinations outside my sleep.

I've been bullied, backstabbed, forgotten, cheated on, and hated for seemingly no reason.

No family ever writes to me, or texts, or calls, and I know they have my info... I made sure of that.

To be honest, the only thing keeping me from collapsing is: my faith in God and Jesus Christ, my love for others, and my will to write books that help people.

I pray everyday I can, not just for me, but for everyone.

I'm just happy my parents sobered up, and are very supportive in my life. I only have them, and a few friends. My only friends are online, and consist of three others.

I'm nineteen now.

I'm past looking for support, or answers, or attention. I'm only intent on helping others now.

For those who are reading this, know that I've been through a myriad of trials. So, you're not alone.
Whether you are religious in beliefs, or secular in perspective, I love you, and you can get through anything.

66,"**Disclaimers:**

1. Sanders seems, to me, to be the best Democratic candidate this year by far. I like him!
2. Most Sanders supporters are not conspiracy theorists — most are normal people who just care about healthcare &amp; education

With that said, there ARE a lot of Sanders supporters, particularly on Reddit, who interpret anything that works in Sanders' favour as objective, welcome news... but anything that works *against* him as a giant media and DNC conspiracy.

It's very, very annoying and I worry that it borders on the same kind of blind, cultish thinking that got Trump elected too.

So to mess with these guys, I've started arguing that everybody is trying to *HELP* Bernie as the establishment candidate, and the real conspiracy this year is against Pete Buttigieg.

Some examples of what I argue:

* Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, demanded that the IDP Iowa Caucuses go through a recanvass process... while Buttigieg was in the lead with 97% of precincts reporting. **Why would the DNC want those results overturned, except to help Sanders?**

* The Iowa recanvass &amp; recount completed recently, correcting all the errors that both the Sanders &amp; Buttigieg campaigns asked for... and Buttigieg still has the most delegates. **So why is the AP refusing to report the official winner, except to undermine Buttigieg?**

* Bernie Sanders is literally an establishment candidate; he's been running political campaigns since 1968 (!!), he's literally a superdelegate, and has such enormous influence in the DNC that he even managed to get the rules changed recently after his 2016 campaign failed. **Isn't he way more of an establishment candidate than Buttigieg who has almost no DNC connections?**

* The DNC rigged the election in favour of Hillary in 2016 because they thought she was the most electable. Now, in 2020, it's not even *close* to arguable that Sanders is most electable — he's winning the Dem primary, he has the highest favourability against Trump, and he's their best fundraiser. **The DNC, as a power hungry and corrupt organisation after money, has it in their self-interest to support Sanders.**

Now, I don't really *believe* these things. My views of the DNC are like those of most large political organisations — they have lots of good people trying to do good work (e.g. Tom Perez wanting Iowa to just make its results fair), and the occasional bad egg that lets bias interfere with their job, but overall they do a decent enough job.

But my *god* is it fun to flip the conspiracy narratives on their heads and instead allege that *YOU* are the DNC shill, Mr. Conspiracy Theorist, and you're just accusing others of the conspiracy to disguise your own!

It's also been a fun personal exercise. It's enlightening to see just how **easy** it is to come up with conspiracy theory bullshit when you want to; no wonder there's so much of it.",28Feb2020,1
67,"I posted this in the relationship subredit and they told me that it would be better to post here so I will try

I've posted a few times here on Reddit about this weird relationship I have with this person. But some background story: I'm not really dating this person
 We are friends with benefits I guess. Before we were just friends and he was the most kind person ever and we got close in the first place because he has helped me a ton with a lot of stuff going on on my life. At some point we started sleeping around and spending more time together. I think I'm in love with him or at least very attached to him. But he doesn't feel the same. But the main point is that since we started sleeping around he changed a lot and did things that before would never do. For example I don't know how but we always end up arguing for stuff that doesn't really matter and he just yells a lot at me and I hate that, a few days ago he broke his own TV in the middle of an argument (then apologized and said never would do something like this again) and like sometimes we end up doing stuff that maybe I don't want to but he doesn't care. The worst fight we had was when I told him I was going on a date with someone else. I lied to him to see his reaction and a lot of people have told me that this is straight up being manipulative. Also I hate when he yells at me and most of the times I will either try to leave or not answer him until he calms down. Some people have also told me that this is a toxic trait in people because you are shutting down the other person and you shouldn't ignore other people when they try to express their feelings (even if they are negative emotions). 

And honestly I agree so much with this because I hate when I'm mad and trying to explain why I'm feeling that way and people are just ignoring me or not taking me seriously. But at the same time I wish he would talk normally to me because hearing all this yelling triggers a lot of negative memories on me. I grew up around a lot of violence (my parents were abusive to me) and honestly I don't know how to act when someone yells at me without overreacting and I feel to lost. 

I hadn't post every single detail about whatever it is what we have going on in here. But I have been thinking that maybe I am the toxic person. Because now that I think about it in my family it's the same. My mother has a good relationship with all my brothers except with me. It's like I'm the one bringing negativity in my household. And maybe I'm just a manipulative person without realising. 

But I don't know how to change. How do I stop all this behaviours? I think I'm a very empathic person. I have a hard time when someone that I know is going through a difficult situation, it's like I feel all their negative emotions. But somehow I fail to see or understand that my actions have consequences and that I may be bringing negativity into other people. Not only this friend that I'm talking about but in general. With my family as well. And I really don't know how to change myself. And I fail to see when part of the problem is my fault as well. 

TL;DR After posting here about a problem I had going on I realized that I'm probably a toxic person to other people and I don't know how to change or at least realize of what I'm doing.",28Feb2020,1
68,"I attend one of the top conservatories for music in the country. The dream of being here convinced me I’d find happiness and somehow be a better version of myself if I just accomplished this one thing. Meaning it’d be proof to myself I was worth my musical pursuits. 

I grew up being told and treated like I didn’t matter and music was the wrong choice. Being someone of color, in the classical reason, I was consistently treated like I’m not worth noticing, shirked to the side, and assumed a less talented musician. That eventually internalized and I  struggled constantly with putting myself down and giving up, not practicing. I love playing the viola. But to some degree, even that isn’t enough when I have this huge complex.

I canceled all my classes today and performances over the weekend. Told everyone I’m sick with a fever. That’s a lie, but who is supposed to take me seriously when I say I’m going through shit? You’re still supposed to show up for class if you’re depressed. Practice 6 hours a day. Be socially acceptable and presentable, attractive to everyone, 24/7 or else people judge you. 

Even if they say they won’t judge you, they do. They isolate you or act like you’re an anomaly if you project you’re slightly unhappy. I’ve been there when they’ve talked about people who are “messed up” or “weird”. It’s hypocritical. The people I thought were my friends judged me for distancing myself, blamed me for coming in “versions” and being “exhausting” with zero effort on their part to ask me how I am. I don’t talk to those people now but I have to see them almost daily. 

I don’t want to be here, accumulating all this debt at a school where my teacher put me in a box and doesn’t really support me. People I cannot be myself around because success in music requires a level of perfection and that includes self image and conduct. I have so much trauma and personal shit I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about or process and I feel like it’s being held against me by people who don’t know they’re doing it. 

That’s my rant. I’m sorry. I don’t know where else to go.",28Feb2020,1

70,"I can’t stop thinking about how I’m just a walking pile of carbon atoms on a dying rock that’s floating through endless, uncaring space.

I think my brain (and most human brains, for that matter) is needlessly aware of its own existence and as a result tries to justify that existence with pointless concepts like meaning or purpose. As far as I can tell, these concepts are completely unnecessary to survival and are totally irrational because the very brains that assign so much meaning and value to them actually invented them in the first place. An individuals ability to define these concepts as they relate to their own life, however, seems to have a pretty dramatic impact on general fulfilment and perceived quality of life.

So, to get to what I’m trying to say, my brain has invented the concept of my existence having meaning, placed value on the concept of my life having meaning, so much so that without a sense of meaning it refuses to find anything but the most shallow and fleeting enjoyment or satisfaction in virtually any activity and yet despite spending nearly every waking hour thinking about and desperately trying to figure out what my purpose here is or what my existence actually means, my idiot brain refuses to accept an answer because it stubbornly keeps telling me that nothing can possibly have meaning because the entire concept of meaning is just an absurd invention of a random amalgamation of carbon atoms that was haphazardly burdened with life, completely by accident.

I don’t know if it’s just a result of feeling like I have no purpose or something else, but my brain won’t even allow me to have a consistent sense of self or a personality. My personality shifts constantly, usually based on my emotions. Emotions that, rather than arise or change due to some form of stimulus like a regular person, act more like a playlist of songs from every imaginable genre on shuffle, flaring up out of nowhere and disappearing just as quickly. My entire world view can shift depending on my current emotion. Of course my brain can only handle spiralling out of control like that for so long which usually leaves me where I am now: blank. Empty. Devoid of personality. 

I don’t have any desire to exist any more. This thought doesn’t come from a place of sadness or anger or hurt, it feels completely devoid of emotional influence altogether. I don’t really know how to put it but it feels almost mathematical or surgical. I just feel as though I’ve seen and done enough, I have no desire to try anything else because I feel pretty certain that nothing is going to have any meaningful impact on me. I’ve tried many recreational activities people have suggested to me, I’ve tried simply dedicating all my time to working and/or studying, I’ve tried multiple medications that were supposed to get my brain to release the serotonin or dopamine or whatever chemical it seems to be lacking (which had no effect as I believe the issue lies with my pattern of thinking rather than solely chemical imbalances), I’ve tried going to therapy, I’ve tried distracting myself with escapism through movies or games or even with substance abuse, I’ve tried having creative outlets and making things and putting them out into the world, I’ve tried a great many things. I’m in no way suggesting that I’ve tried everything, simply that I feel like I’ve tried enough to see the underlying pattern of my having either little to no satisfaction from anything or on the few occasions where I do find enjoyment doing something I end up facing diminishing returns until eventually I no longer do.

Despite having no desire to exist, I also understand that ending my existence isn’t an option either. Unfortunately I’m also cursed with the particular set of brain functions and chemicals I believe they call ‘empathy’ and ‘guilt’. I’ve been told by family members and friends how it would make them feel if I wasn’t around and I refuse to put anyone through those emotions on my behalf, even if I can’t at all understand how or why people would actually care about me in any meaningful sense. I’ve been told it’s largely because I’m funny or even charismatic, which anyone reading this post might have an incredibly difficult time believing given the whole cold, clinical, impersonal tone of it, but that’s what I’ve been told and true or not that still just boils down to say that, on occasion, I might make a particular set of sounds with my vocal chords that we as humans interpret as words and those sounds can illicit a sense of happiness or humour in the people within people within a close enough vicinity to hear them. That’s all it is, anyone can do that, it hardly makes me irreplaceable.

So I just feel like I’m sitting around, forcing myself to exist without any meaning, simply waiting for my biological clock to tick down or some type of accident to befall me so that people don’t feel too bad about my death.

Anyway I don’t really know why I’m posting this, I think it’s because it’s all I can think about at the moment. Sometimes I guess it helps to express it somehow and I can’t really talk to anyone in my life about it because I’ve only ever really trusted one person enough to open up properly about this type of stuff and I’ve been trying to distance myself from them (and everyone else) recently because every time I talk to them, despite me always wanting desperately not to and regretting it afterwards, I can’t help but spill everything that’s on my mind to the point where I feel like it’s all I ever talk to them about and that must be incredibly draining for them when they probably just want me to be the person they thought I was when we became friends in the first place. I feel like they must get so frustrated with our interactions now because they probably just want to see me get better and start to help myself or change and I am trying to, despite believing nothing in life will ever really give me a sense of purpose or lasting satisfaction, I’m still in therapy to learn how to better cope with those feelings and to attempt to figure out a life direction but I still feel like I could and should be doing more to help myself. I’m trying so hard not to disappoint everyone but my progress feels so slow if it exists at all and I still slip up all the time and do things I know I shouldn’t do out of reckless impulses. So I’m turning to making anonymous posts on the Internet because I’ve isolated myself from the people who know me personally because it feels cruel, disrespectful and sometimes weirdly manipulative to keep involving them in my garbage.

74,"Starting when I was 10 years old, my dad's best friend started molesting me. He would volunteer to come over and babysit and my dad never thought anything of it, because they had been friends for so long. Plus, he had a wife, so he was even more trustworthy. It happened for 2 years, until one day my parents came home early and it scared him into never doing it again. 

But I will never say anything to my parents because I don't want to hurt my dad and give him the guilt that his friend did this to me and it's their fault for letting him keep coming over. So now, I still have to see him fairly often and even though it's been years, I still get reminded of it every time he smiles at me or hugs me.

78,"I feel so scared of revealed my personality when I go online. I can't help but write walls of text, it's who I am, I'm a blogger and writer. People pretend to be perfect and most people give the impression that they live normal lives of 'Netflix and Travelling'. However, I find it hard to believe that no one has their struggles.

The most successful r4r posts I've put on here are the really dark ones. I've met some interesting friends (including one in my own city) though no dice and I'm not upset about it. I did get ghosted a lot when people realized how troubled I am and don't have the emotional resources to handle it.

I'm a very open a person and want someone to be ready to handle me but every girl wants mister perfect. I'd rather have someone as messed up as me who understands what pain feels like. If you creep up on my post history and see what I wrote, it's not the brightest thing ever.

Dating websites have become very shallow focusing only on looks. I'm considered average by most but I do have my nervous smiles and don't always look confident. I'm Middle-Eastern and most of the ladies are Caucasian which honestly don't seem attracted to me though others are.

I have serious health issues which are chronic and take a lot work to deal with. I'm ready to deal with the same thing on the other side. However, it seems that I have to hide everything from my condition to my income (which is way above average).

I've tried all sort of styles from short profiles that hide everything about me and make me seem interesting to very detailed outlines of myself. I can't hide behind the screen, I have to let myself out to let the other person know what they're going to be dealing with.

I started going out way more and I'm having way more success in the real world. Although I don't go to bars and raves, I do go to meetups and volunteer a bit. More people are intrigued and actually ask questions about my troubles. I'm a part time Uber driver and rarely I open up about my life but I always get a ton of interest and intrigue.

I’m in band, have a job, and of course, go to school, so between work, rehearsal, and your average school day, I don’t get a whole lot of alone time. Because of that, I get pretty stressed, and I tend to get easily frustrated. 

Today I was at Walmart buying some snacks before school, and I pulled wanted to take out twenty bucks for my tithe cause I just got paid. I was in a bit of a hurry and just completely left the twenty dollars at the self check out, only realizing when I walked into my first class of the day. Normally I’d get really frustrated, stressed out, and let this pretty small thing ruin my day cause that’s how life works when my mental health isn’t as great. However! Today it was alright, I was upset for about thirty seconds, and then it was alright. I’m still gonna have an okay day (although rehearsal later is always a coin toss). 

I don’t really care to try to get the money back, it’s not gonna kill me to not have it. I’ll probably go back later to pull another twenty out so I still have my tithe, but thankfully, I don’t care enough to make a big deal about getting that twenty back :)",28Feb2020,1

88,"The thing I want most in my life right now is someone to consistently turn to. I have friends, but I don’t consider myself truly close to any of them. My family is not close enough for me to open up to, and in any case there is only so much you can share with family. What I really want is a close group of friends, people who I can trust and who can trust me, who I want to spend time with and who equally want to spend time with me. I saw people have friendships like this in high school, and assumed I could make my own when I started college: instead, I saw other people settle into their circles while I spent many weekends with nothing to do and no idea who to reach out to. What worries me the most is that I occupied the same role among these groups in both high school and college - I was a floater, who people liked and didn’t mind spending time with, but was never a close part of the friend groups that I saw. I would spend time with people and hear about the moments they shared together, while not being a part of most of them. These things never bothered me at the start of high school, but as I grew and became more self-aware I began to increasingly realize how little I knew about the people in my life and how distant I actually was from them.

A lot of this is my own fault. I am not the type of person to readily open up to others, share details about their life, start conversations, or even reach out. To some extent, I think this is why I got a long with the friends I did have in high school - we didn’t expect/need more from each other than funny photos and a chance to play video games every once in a while, so it was fine for the most part. But now, I feel like a lot of the friendships I had in high school were not very strong and that I can't even turn to those people. On top of that, the fact that a lot of my friends seemed closer to each other, were more outgoing than I, and generally happier with their lives makes me feel as though there is something off about me that I need to fix. I still struggle to reach out to people, something that I finally realized since going to college. The fact that I struggle to connect with people dissuades me from starting conversations/closer relationships with people I’m friendly with or enjoy spending time with. I instead feel the need to isolate myself and spend far too much time in my own head, imagining relationships I wish I had with other people even as I make zero effort to form those relationships. These are things I want to change about myself but have no clue how to, and at times have no motivation to put effort towards.

I can't tell if there's something wrong with me or if this is just my personality and that I need to learn to live with it. I feel this way no matter where I go, and I feel like it's screwing me over because I always feel like I don't fit in anywhere. Does anyone else feel this way?

As that’s what my sisters tell me, and I believe them, from the questions and observations I have had.
So I hope and feel as if they are being honest.

I would feel so guilty and terrible to take a home away from my siblings, that hopefully gives them a much better and good life, that I didn’t get much of.

Yeah fucking right, you are just trying to get high.

I also asked if she is even fucking considering the risk she is taking, and not ONLY for not only herself, because she already has kidney problems and this medication is terrible for that. 
As her doctor said she cannot take this and made it clear as to why.
I also asked if she is even to consider the fact, 
she would lose her 2 fucking daughters,
if she got caught, supposedly actually selling them.
All because she got addicted to this shit.

I have told my dad, and in short he basically said,
“I can not control your mom, we don’t think alike at all.”
He won’t divorce her, 
just for the sake of his kids/my sisters.
I am trying to get him to fucking understand that he needs to fucking have a conversation with my mom about this shit. 
He doesn’t think she will listen and be open minded, and neither do I.
But maybe knock some sensible reality into her damn head about this shit. 
Her kids. 
Her overall wellbeing.
This goddamn addiction she seeks.

The main reasons I believe she is trying to unjustly keep this habit, is because of financials, and very bad personal self blame.

My parents have some very shitty and heavy debt.
Mostly from hospital bills. 
As I don’t if this is still a debt they are repaying, 
but my younger brother, passed away from brain cancer in 2013. 
Before that they did whatever the hell any parent could, to try and save their 3 year old kid,
and/or get as much time as they can with them.
They had given him and/done so much treatment for for him. 
Then he passed between 4 and 5 years later, 
at the age of &amp;.
She told me she hates herself for putting him through all that pain. 
She doesn’t know if her wanting to have that time with him, 
she doesn’t know if it was a cruel and selfish act.
Compared to letting him pass away in a much shorter amount of time, whilst he would be on heavy pain medication. 
Even though he was on that heavy pain medication anyways.
I couldn’t imagine living with that kind of regret.

Otherwise, with other stressing financials, 
they often are having to “save the house” from the bank.
As they, mostly my mom, do not know how to make smart/rational, financial decisions.

From my mom coming home with a new pet after another from time to time. 
As a surprise to my dad.
With a whopping 5 dogs and 7 cats at most, once.
To convincing her mom, the Grandma I stay with,
take out loan(s) for them. 
That they pay her for.
As they obviously have shitty credit.

My Grandma is 76, going on 77 this year.
Living off of Social Security and she has a job as a custodian.
A 76 year old women like her should not have to fucking work a job that’s considered a labor job for her age and physical shape.
She suffers from arthritis as well.

To my dad maintaining his alcoholic habit, 
to trying to commit suicide,
in which he lives much happier today, 
because if weren’t for me, 
he wouldn’t be here. I saved him.
God dammit I want to fucking cry so fucking bad typing this. 
I can’t and won’t. 
I need to be strong for myself and for my sisters.
Even if crying isn’t weakness, 
I just can’t.
It would be so much worse for my sisters if he had died. 
To know why and how your dad died, 
makes them such my subtle to doing so, I fear.
They need him much more than my mom.

He should’ve gotten some fucking help.
How do you not even consider your fucking kids!?
You would to miss their fucking graduations.
You would miss their fucking weddings.
You would miss any and every one of their mother fucking mile and/or life stones.

I don’t know.
What matters now is that he goes to therapy every 3 weeks.
He is on new medication.
His alcoholism had greatly decreased.
He is alive and getting help.

Now we owe $50k (with or without insurance I don’t fucking know), 
for that hospital stay. 

Point being, 
they are so terrible at making financial decisions.
They have or had bad self medicating habits.
To where I don’t even know if they would ever live debt free.
With everything, I don’t know if I can blame rightfully blame and/or at least deceive them.
From everything they have been through.

I don’t know. 
I’m fucking 17.
This is the shit I have to deal with.
That’s not even half of it.
Yeah, it could be worse. 
Just knowing that I am truly grateful.
But that doesn’t change I fucking feel.

All I know is that I’m strong headed as fuck.
I know that I won’t fall down from this, if so I’ll get the fuck back up.
As that big brother for my littlest sister.

Sadly, 
it seems as if I only want to live in motivation of my sisters well being.
I won’t let them, that youngest sister at least.
Do and make the same fucking mistakes I had made.
I won’t let or allow her to cope,
with pills, alcohol and/or weed.
She won’t end up have an overdose.
She won’t end up in Psych Ward on 2 different occasions.
Not on my watch, and if someone physically hurts her at an age where it’s known to not hit or do such to a girl or whoever.
They will get what’s coming, 
but I won’t goto jail for murder.

I know it’s going to be okay as time goes on.
I know I will be okay at least.",28Feb2020,1
103,"Didn´t get invited to the night out. All of my friends who I party and go out to night clubs with didn´t invite me last night. I asked most of them during the week if they were going out on that day and everyone said yes without asking me back. I always get as averagely drunk amongst everyone else and am very social, (never felt that anyone has disliked my company, what so ever).

The only thing that would separate me from most of the friends at the parties would be that I don´t inhale any laughing gas (which most guys there do). I probably have the least ""Crazy stories"" related to alcohol/drugs/sex...Does that make me boring?

I want us to live together next year and get married but that seems so surreal, like something that will never happen. I worry he will get tired of the long distance and that we will eventually break up because of it. I have learned that loving someone and missing them is harder than just being alone and not worrying about anyone but yourself.

I’ve seen his sister wearing it but she never returns any of his clothes and they always end up in her wardrobe and she gets annoyed when he tries to take them back. Also she never asks to borrow his clothes, she just goes in and takes them.

Personally this annoys me because it feels like he is wasting his money buying clothes that he won’t get to wear, especially when he’s spending $100 for a hoodie.

110,"Shoutout to the woman at the grocery store who helped me pull my cart over the threshold after it bounced back and rammed me in the leg because I'm stupid. Writing about my awkward daily encounters on Reddit helps me not spend so many nights lying awake thinking about this shit.

My local grocery store has a single-door side exit with a metal threshold at the bottom. You know, like a metal strip except this one is slightly slanted on either side and about one and a half inches tall; it actually looks similar to a speedbump. You have to either rear your cart back to get the front wheels over or go at it with a running start like Harry Potter trying to get though to Platform nine and three quarters, and I did neither, so the cart just rammed into the threshold and in turn crashed into my leg extremely hard. I was in so much shock and pain that for a solid few seconds I just stood there like an idiot, then this woman who had been standing nearby was like ""Oh, here hon!"" and helped pull the cart over. I just kind of laughed and said thank you because I was too focused on not falling to the ground weeping to do anything else, but seriously, people like her make the world go round.

It's been 4+ hours and I still have a gigantic, swollen, half-dollar sized goose egg on my shin. It's so sensitive I can't even stand for my pants leg to touch it so I'm walking around with one legged pulled up to my knee like a doofus, and putting too much weight on it hurts.

I consider myself pretty independent, practically and emotionally. I can always find interesting stuff to do and rarely feel homesick before. But this all changed after a month of soft home quarantine in my hometown thanks to the Coronavirus.

In the first few days I felt bored and trapped, unable to go back and carry on with my normal adult life. Then the home life settled in. I was staying in my old room which I haven’t stayed long since 16. My dad would cook all these amazing meals that just made the takeouts look like a joke. We would drink some wine, have a nice family conversation (mixed with fears of Coronavirus development) and help each other clean up. It just felt really nice to be looked after, to be taken care of, to also live with your parents with a more mature mindset, and to know you are always not alone.

Today I went back to the city and started my “normal life” again. But I immediately felt quite lonely and was thinking about the good moments at home, which hasn’t really happened before. This really makes me wonder, to how much extent career development in a different city / country justifies the sacrifice of quality family time. Like I have a lot of high school friends who are married now in my hometown, living close to their parents. I used to think them as traditional and boring, now I can really relate and almost feel a bit of envy. Really, what is money and success all about if that takes you away from your family? 

I understand there are probably culture differences when it comes to family values, but has anyone felt the same? A rejuvenated homesickness that feels more raw because you can now really appreciate things as they are.

 Part One: In Which I See that You are in a Cage  


…and I want to get you out of there. After all, I am very clever! I know a lot about cages, having inhabited a few. For one thing, I know that the locks aren’t real. The doors open easily; all you have to do is walk right through.  


\----------  
*Part One: In Which You Approach my Cage, and a Beautiful Thing Is Created*   


*Hello, beautiful stranger! I see you eyeballing this cage and the magnificent broken bird inside it. The cage doesn't look like much, and it's not an easy thing, being a bird with clipped wings, being stunted, being not born for this world. It's a pain I have learned to accommodate, for there is no overcoming it.*   
*But look at you, you certainly look like you like pretty things in cages. Will you feed me? Will you care for me? In return, I promise to sing pretty songs about you and your extraordinary birdkeeping abilities until the day I die. I promise.*   
\----------  


Oh yes, I know all about it. And thank goodness! Because you will need me, need my expertise. I’m sure of it.  


I will climb into that cage with you and I will teach you everything I know. I will plumb my depths. I will dig down into the bottom-most reaches of my soul, the places I hardly ever visit. I will pull out pearls. I will offer them to you – at first tentatively and then with a greater force and abandon as you require more and more of this knowledge, this love.  


I feel you drinking in what I’m offering and I think, we’re getting somewhere!

  
\----------

  
*You plumb the depths of your soul and you bring up sympathy for my plight in this cage. Delicious, sweet nectar. I lap it up greedily and cry for more. I didn't realize how hungry I was for compassion until you gave it to me. More, more, my love, my dearest, my favorite,  I love you. Often, you give me pearls of wisdom. I don't need them, but they are pretty and they come from you, so I like them. I use them to decorate my cage. You are the greatest caretaker on Earth. I sing madrigals for you and you bring up more nectar and I chipper in glee. This is the perfect relationship, of caretaker and pretty broken thing.*   


\----------  


I am so excited for the day that you will exit your cage with the knowledge and the energy I gave you. You’ll be so overjoyed. In your freedom, you’ll glow with the life that runs through your veins – your birthright. Your hair will resume its luster; your eyes will light up. You will laugh with joy – not this hollow, bitter laugh that rings in my ears now. Not this laugh that says, I hate who I am. Not this laugh that says: I dare you. I dare you to come closer.  


No, once you get out, you’ll surely come running straight to me – your savior. You’ll come to me in joy and in love – not sarcasm and fear – and you will hold me close and say, “I couldn’t have done it without you!” Maybe your eyes will even have tears in them because you’ll be recognizing the depths to which I went to try to save you and you’ll finally see how much I love you and then – then! – you’ll never leave me again.  


\----------

  
*You say we're making progress. Progression towards what? You do see that my wings are clipped, don't you? You reach deep, deep inside... and pick me up. I do not bristle at your touch. Then, you take me out. No, no!! This is all wrong! Maybe in a different universe, this would work but I'm not made to soar. I cannot. I cannot do the things that come naturally to you. You put me down and I flail about, stretching the broken wings that have never been used except to be preened for others to see. It hurts like fire. Stop! Don't you see how you have caused me pain by making me exist out here? Why? Why would my keeper hurt me? I am confused and afraid. I want to go home. I hobble back into my cage and sing for food, praying that the normalcy of caretaker and care-taken will resume. It doesn't.*

  
\----------  


Part Two: In Which You Do Not Wish to Exit  


What is this? You don’t want to leave your cage? You live here? You never said that you wanted to leave? This is madness! What kind of a creature lives in a place like this?  


\----------  
*Part 2: In Which I Realize My Caretaker Doesn't Want to be My Caretaker*   


*I do, thank you very much. I tried to tell you, it's not an easy life being a caged bird but that is immutably what I am. This is my home, and I like it here, kind of. At least, it's way safer than out there. And, look, look, my Birdkeeper! Don't be dismayed! You're here with me, and you can feed me and care for me and it will all be alright!*

 *I open up and try my very best to sing about what a wonderful birdkeeper you are, but my voice warbles. I can see the pain in your eyes. My wings hurt. You tried to take me out of my cage and my wings hurt! Why are you hurt?* 

  
\----------  


Oh, but this is where it all happens, isn’t it. The drama. The crunching together, the grinding of gears. The fucking. The drinking. The crying. The shouting. The madness. Because now I am angry. I’m giving a lot and I’m not getting any gratitude! I’m getting treated terribly.

  
\-----------

  
*I haven't eaten in days. The pearls you gave me have fallen off of my cage. I do not put them back. Almost overnight, my perfect rescuer became my worst fear. You haven't fed me, you haven't cleaned my cage. I stop singing for you, because you promised to make me whole again and you failed to deliver. The rescuing I wanted was to be taken care of, not to be forcibly thrust into a world that was not made for me, a world I gave up on long, long ago. This feels like abuse. It hurts. I scream. My talons cut you. I'm so, so sorry. How has it come to this, that the person who was supposed to take care of me makes me screech and claw the air-- and your hands-- in pain and fear?*   


\----------  


I try to annihilate you. I keep crying out that I love you, but I am trying to kill you. We are trying to kill each other. You are not what I want! we say. But we still want. Where is it, this thing that I want? Why aren’t you giving it to me?  


\----------

  
*My caretaker, I love you so much, and I was so grateful for your love, but you want me to be like you, independent and free, self-reliant, self-nurturing. Don't you understand that will never happen? It CAN never happen; I've tried it before, many years ago, and was met with failure. Outside of my cage I will die. You are going to kill me. Do not make me relive the desire for normalcy, the false hope, the defeat, the slow climb to acceptance. Acceptance is this: I am a flightless bird in a cage, made only to be loved and fed, made only to sing to my caretakers. I try to explain these things to you; you seem not to understand. I beg you to feed me, that beautiful nectar of compassion, but you are empty. I do not understand why. I suspect you are withholding it from me on purpose. Resentment bubbles within me. I beg you, my caretaker, to stay and BE my caretaker. You promise you're not going anywhere.*  


\-----------  


Well I’ll tell you what: I’m not leaving. No sir. I’m not leaving until I get it. I’m going to sit right here in this cage with you. If you won’t leave, neither will I. At least I’ll get to be with you. At least now I am bound to you in fury. Bound to you in fear. Bound to you in misery.  


\------------

  
*I begin to grow openly agitated. You are my caretaker. You made it clear from the start that you wanted to see gratitude, love, devotion. When you feed me, I give you that in spades. I thought you were content to take care of me and love me, but now the things I can give you aren't worth it to you unless I leave the cage. Why on earth is this so? I can see that you are miserable. But I can't leave. My gifts of praise and adoration are all that I have for you, and they are not enough. I myself and not enough for you. I realize you may never have even wanted to own and take care of a bird and I weep. You weep with me. I have no idea why you're crying. You must want sympathy. For one hour, as long as I can stand, I pretend you are the bird and I am the birdkeeper. Despite what you have done, I feed you.*   


\----------  


You hold me on the couch, my body curled over your lap, between your two arms like a child. I cry and cry and cry. I love you so much, but you don’t really want to be with me, not out here in the world. In the air. In the place where you get up, day after day, and go on living. No. You wipe my tears away with a tissue, say nothing. I bury my face in your shoulder. I say nothing. I kiss you. If you won’t leave, then I won’t leave you.  


\----------

  
 *That world out there, where you breathe the crisp air and live your life unfettered, is my hell. I don't understand how or why anyone likes being there, working, living, doing, straining. But then, I am not like you. I need to be in here, with someone to feed me and hear my pretty songs. It's not much of a life, but I vastly prefer it to being out there, where I can only flap uselessly like a dying thing and eat whatever mealy crumbs of self-care I can manufacture. Out there is my hell.*   


\----------

  
Later, you say you don’t remember the conversation. You’ve been drinking and your brain doesn’t remember much of anything you say.

  
\-----------

  
*I have forgotten, thankfully, hearing my caretaker-- no, my person-who-was-once-my-caretaker-- begging me to leave the cage, explaining that he wants a life with a free woman and not a captured, injured thing whose only purpose is to be fed and loved. The realization broke my heart. It took so much alcohol to numb that realization into nothing, into the same intangible background pain that comprises the memory of my wings being clipped. I don't remember that either. All I remember now is my caretaker did something scary.*   


\----------  


And you’re not doing anything, anything to make this better. I just don’t understand it. I’ve explained it so many times but it’s like I’m only talking to myself.  


I start to feel like I don’t exist. I find myself standing in the kitchen with a knife pressed to my arm, wanting to feel pain. Then I come to and put it down. I’m scared. I’m beginning to be destroyed by a hole that’s opening up inside of me, where I thought my heart was. You took my heart away. That must be it. You took my heart away and now I can’t feel anything and I never want to move from this bed. Together, we can lie here. It would be best to lie here. Not moving. After all, if I leave this place there’s no chance you’re going to follow me, and I can’t stand the thought of being without you.  


\----------

  
*You have begun acting like a flightless bird, too, and have taken residence in my cage. I despise this. You're supposed to be taking care of me, or did that go completely out the window once you saw that I have inbuilt limitations? You're no bird.  Even if you ARE now somehow a captured bird just like me, this cage is tiny with two birds in it. I squawk at you. You squawk back. Frequently, we tussle.*   


*And nobody, not one soul on God's green earth, is feeding us. I am heartbroken.* 

  
\----------  


Part Three: In Which I am Saved by the Grace of God  


Finally, the truth comes to me, comes for me. I don’t ask for it. I get hurt by accident and I lie in the hospital. I realize I am alive. I read a book: Suffering is Optional. Accept everything exactly as it is. I love you. We are not children. I have to end this suffering, for me and for you.  


\---------- 

  
*Part Three- The Nightmare Reaches Its Zenith So the Cycle May Continue*  


*I love you, but you haven't acted like my caretaker for months and now that you're in the hospital I realize you are too fragile-- you were not built to be my caretaker just as I was not built to fly. I swallow my guilt, for this is about survival, life and death. I begin preening the wings and long tail that had become  grimy with neglect, and begin singing my song anew, with shaky hope that if I sing loud enough, a true caretaker will find me and love me for what I am--  unable to live life in the real world like the rest of you. I must find them. They are out there. If not, I'll have to-- NO!! I do not let myself think of the possibilities; they are worse than death. Death. If I cannot find another, truer caretaker, I will have to die. Problem solved.*

  
\----------  


I get up, walk over to the door. Guess what? The locks are an illusion. I simply step outside. The air is still there. My heart breaks open and suddenly I understand: I am not in control. I fall to the ground, without knowing if I’m ever going to get up again.  


I give my heart to the universe, down so low, sobbing onto the kitchen tiles. Never again will I deny my self – my need, my life-force, my desire. God holds a gun to my head and drags me around the room, as Rumi says, tearing from my hands everything I no longer need. I am emptied. I am nothing. I promise – never again! Never again! Ok, ok! I say. I hear you. I’ll do it.  


\-------------

  
*Your internal conflict perplexes me. Did I not try to tell you that I cannot fly? Did I not try to tell you that I needed food and love? Did you somehow not recognize that we cannot be equal partners, but caretaker and charge? For fuck's sake, another one's gone and I'm broken, again. I love you. My wings fucking HURT and I'm HUNGRY. My mind races as I run through anything, everything I might possibly do to prevent my caretaker walking out and leaving me to starve. I squawk. I sing beautiful melodies. It has no effect.  I rattle my cage loudly. You are frightened. Frightened of an injured, tiny little creature like me? I'm confused. I huddle in my cage and stare at you forlornly. Your eyes water. But you do not feed me. I am hurt, but apathetically unsurprised.*   


\-----------  


And I give you over to God because I cannot make you happy. I imagine you receiving the embrace of the world. I give my love to you in the only real way I can. I let you go.  


And I am alone.  


\---------

  
*I watch you walk away, perplexed and broken, as always, as though it were the first time, by the lofty promises of a forever caretaker and the crushing realization that you accidentally lied.*   


*And I am alone.*   


*Until I spy a beautiful stranger eyeing my cage.*",28Feb2020,1
