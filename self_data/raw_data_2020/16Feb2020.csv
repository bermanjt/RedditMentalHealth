0,"This took place while I was hospitalized two months ago in a mental hospital, so it's a pretty unique scenario.

But basically, in that mental health there was this mentally disabled woman with down syndrome, 25 years old, who went around constantly doing mischief and disgusting things. She had the literal mind of a child. She spit on the floor and on people's faces, when eating she'd force herself to throw up, she'd piss and shit all over herself, etc...and to top it all off, she rarely ever showered, meaning she was very stinky. And no offense to fat people, but to top it all off she weighed like 350 pounds, meaning the sweat and stink was even more intense.

And one day, me and the group I met in there were conversating. And in the middle of it the woman started to force herself to throw up all over her food. Then we made comments about her.

Then one of the guys who had gotten there 2 days ago said, ""You know how much I like them big girls, heh heh. I'd like to take a big girl's ass like that and stick my dick all up in her and then just go skeet skeet"", he said as he smiled with joy laughing. And from the expression on his face, I could tell he wasn't joking. And I got a really visual mental image of the whole thing that literally made me gag.

And so I went like, ""Awh dude! Dude! I call tell you're not joking! I can tell you're actually serious! You're disgusting! Don't even look at me bro!"", and then I turned to the other guys and said, ""this is another one we gotta avoid in this damn mental hospital!""

And then he looked at me with a super shocked face, and said, ""Crackers of your kind beat my ass. They beat my ass with an iron baseball bat. 4 of them. I was in a coma for 2 days. So a cracker like you right next to me getting pissed? I'ma move away bro.""

And then I said, ""Oh, so this is about race now, and now about the fact that you said that you'd **FUCK** that girl?!""

And then he said, ""Well I see nothing wrong with that girl. I like big girls, and a pussy is a pussy.""

And then I said, ""Oh, so you've been here for 2 days and you didn't know that girl was retarded?!""

And then the staff members there who sort of keep the place in control had to tell me to calm down or else they'd put me in seclusion.

Looking back, I guess I sort of snapped unnecessarily, but being human and having reactions and emotions, I don't know how I could **NOT** have.",16Feb2020,1

4,"When I was a child I ended up in a place with a lot of other boys. It was where you went when your parents couldn't look after you.

While there I attended school.  It was not a good school; it was two prefabricated mobile classrooms and two burned out teachers between 80 or so of us and there was no separation by age or skill level.

I left this place in 2000. It was not super difficult to find work then. It was manageable.

Some time after I left, it closed down and there is now a supermarket on the site.

Today, in the age of big data, I find myself at odds with the world.  It has started trying to push me out.

I have recently become unemployed and I am back out in the market with a new resume and a deep and burning desire to feed my family.

The last 3 jobs i've actually had a response from (out of easily 200+) have all had ""standard background checking procedures"" which are all the rage these days.

The first time I encountered this, I played the game.  I clicked on the link and was whisked to the Experian website where I was drained of information; 5 years work history, 5 years employment history, any convictions? no. Pretty easy, except for one part.

""Please enter school"".

I inserted all the data I was asked for and submitted the form. The next day an email landed; ""We can't find your school"" it read.

I called them but after feeding them reams of data, post codes, dates, alternative names for the site, numbers of government departments who should have this information... The could not process the application.

The next two jobs both had the same ""standard background checking procedures"" and it was outsourced to the same Experian.  I elected not to waste my time and went back on indeed.  

I feel like this will only continue, expand, escalate, get worse.

I believe there's no room for me in this world anymore unless I'm happy to shovel fucking fries.

I always said that if I ever became a burden upon my family that I would remove myself from the equation. When I said that, I was referring to getting dementia or some other old-people illness that meant I needed a carer.  The outcome, however, appears the same.

If this continues, I'll have no choice but to take myself out of the equation.

5,"I need to get my story out to see if im in the wrong or my parents are. Im 17 years old and am dealing with my addiction of vaping. In my high school everyone vapes, which is why I got pulled into this. I know its my fault for trying it but now I am hooked on it. My parents are very strict and hate drugs as it is, especially because my dads dad died when he was in highschool from lung cancer and my dad says it’s because he was a big cigarette smoker. Anyways every weekend I would go hangout with my friends, we all would vape. Almost every single one of my good friends vape. It sucks because I know vaping is not good for me but being hooked on it now and having everyone that associates with me doing it makes it extremely hard to quit. 

My parents recently caught me again with my vape and told me this time around this punishment would be a lot worse. Which it was. They stopped letting me use my car, took all my money and credit card that I’ve worked for, won’t let me go out at all to see my friends. Ive been two weeks already into this punishment, I’ve been home everyday. They blame me vaping on putting a big factor on their marriage. Making me feel like complete shit. Ive been going to school and coming home everyday as I see all my friends going out and hanging out with eachother. So many people in my school do it and im the one getting put through this. My parents constantly bring me down, calling me a “lowlife” “druggie” and saying they don’t know who I am anymore and that I have no hobbies. Ive been so mentally depressed from them constantly being me down. I feel hopeless on ever gaining their trust back again, Even though im willing to quit vaping to have my life back again. 

I been home these past two weeks, dealing with them making comments about me vaping all the time. Not only is it hard enough to stop, I have to deal with my parents degrading comments everyday. 

On top of this I am so mentally unstable. No I haven’t been diagnosed with depression but everyday I wake up I looking forward to nothing, I have multiple times thought about committing suicide but my parent think that having a mental illness is a joke. Whenever I tell them I am very upset and I think I need a therapist they say “whats so bad in your life?” and my mom says “I should be the one depressed through all the shit I’ve gone through my childhood” (which she did have a very bad childhood and no longer communicates with her mom.) Ive never felt more alone in my life, My parents never ask me if im okay, I’ve been taking sleeping pills to try and sleep all day to deal with how I feel. I wake up from my naps and all I hear my mom say is “wake up” and I say “to do what? I have nothing to look foward to” *due to being grounded* and she just says “this is why I need to find you hobbies”. I feel like im being held hostage, I am not able to see any of my friends and Im scared of going back into my vaping habits knowing everyone my generation does it. It frustrates me so much, I just want to break down and cry. Please help.",16Feb2020,1
6,"When I was in school I was a little chubby. Not very overweight, not obese, just a little chubby. A lot of girls were very skinny, blonde, white etc. I was/an ethnic, Spanish/Italian on mum’s side and euroasian on dad’s side (Armenian/Anglo-Indian/Asian mixed). My body type is petite but curvy (if that makes any sense, like I am LITTLE - short and even when fat I’m still small, I just don’t look good) and I’m brown - brown hair, brown eyes, brown skin. It was not common at my school, and the whole Kim K exotic looks fetishism thing didn’t come up until I was just about to graduate, so basically I felt like I wasn’t attractive all through my teens and in some cases other people also commented on it/were mean and whatever. 

After school ended I lost 20kgs. So I was about 50kgs.  I lost this by taking medication that made me feel sick if I ate, and by walking home from the train instead of getting the bus, 1 hour of walking even in the rain, even at night, even when I was so sick I had to stop and throw up. Some people, like my parents, my partner, other family members said I became too skinny. But I actually don’t think I’ve ever looked better. I got so many compliments from both men and women, I gained a large ish following on social media and despite still feeling ugly and still thinking I needed to do more to be more attractive I also felt kind of more comfortable, just knowing I wasn’t being called fat anymore. I also eventually started doing PT sessions 3 days a week and my body looked good but I couldn’t keep it up as I wasn’t eating enough. Sometimes I used to have to stop during a session because my trainer would notice my face turning pale white and I’d be having black spots in front of my eyes/felt like gravity was pulling my body down. I was also very out of control emotionally and had terrible outbursts of inappropriate anger and/or sadness. I had a physical fight with my sister over a phone charger, and we actually have a great and really close relationship most of the time. This all went on for about 5 years. 

My partner and I moved in together 2 years ago and since then I’ve literally put on so much weight I am bigger than I have ever been in my life. I don’t think I’m “just chubby” now. I’m fat, I’m out of shape, I feel so uncomfortable in my own body. I never take photos, I’ve missed really important moments that I normally would have liked to document (our first home together, pictures with our kitten and puppy - I mean I have thousands of photos of them but not even one of me WITH THEM, our anniversaries, my sisters engagement party, getting my license etc). I have tried to exercise but I’m not getting results quick enough. I started doing PT again but unfortunately couldn’t afford it cos I have other things that need to be taken care of before I can afford a luxury such as personal training. I can’t go to the gym by myself, like I just can’t, the amount of anxiety and self consciousness I feel prevents me from exercising properly. That’s why I like PT, I feel secure and like ... protected? I guess? So I’ve been exercising at home and walking the dog for 1-2 hours every day. I’ve been trying to eat healthier but sometimes I feel so down I have no energy and then my partner tries to cheer me up by saying “don’t worry you don’t have do anything, just come home and relax” and he buys us dinner - not complaining about him he is amazing, he tries to buy us healthy food but it’s the actual quantities of the food that is the problem. Growing up my grandparents always told me I had to eat everything on my plate as there were kids back in India or wherever that didn’t even have a piece of bread to eat every day. To this day if there is food in front of me I struggle to NOT eat it. Even if I feel sick, or I don’t like it that much. When I was skinny I remember one day there was a plate with cheese on it on the table and I had to physically get up and leave the room because I was so anxious that I was going to eat it. That really disturbs me in a way, cos it’s embarrassing, imagine being afraid of a plate of cheese. That’s fucked up. 

Went out for my sister’s hens night last and I was fucking miserable. I kept thinking “I’ve got to stop eating again”. Like I am on the verge of choosing to starve myself again and I know it’s wrong but I feel so desperate about it. I understand healthy food, portion control and exercise will eventually get me into a good shape, but I want those results like, tomorrow morning when I wake up. I want to be back in my (AUS) size 6s and not be a 14 pushing to a 16. I HATE my body right now. 

Sorry this is a lot and is probably a bit jumbled up, I’ve never spoken to anyone about this in depth, I just needed to get it off my chest I guess.",16Feb2020,1

As promised an update for you all!

Well it’s Feb 15th, almost two weeks since leaving my controlling family. I never told them I was coming back, and since leaving on Jan 31st they kept calling asking when I’d be back from grad school interviews. Each time I would say the next week, and then that time would come and they’d ask again and I would say the next week. Eventually they caught on, and straight up asked if I was coming back. I said no.

They were sad. But they understood. I love my family, despite how they treat me. I want them to see I can live my own life happily. They’re slowly starting to see that if they keep up what they do they’ll lose me forever. My mom is adorable and said she opened an IKEA card so she can get me furniture to make me comfortable. My heart is broken. My family loves me endlessly, when they realized I wasn’t coming back they said “we just want you to be happy, we love you”. I feel like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

I interviewed for grad schools, but was sadly not called back for second rounds to any of my choices. Such is grad school, I’ll try again next year. Otherwise I’m just applying for places to live and a good job to sustain myself.

Finally, I just want to say thank you to everyone who showed me so much support and gave me positive words of affirmation. Not only did it help propel me where I am, but it motivated me to not disappoint. To anyone else in a situation where they feel stuck, I will say this it was not easy to break out. It never felt like the right time. I doubted myself a lot, but I did it anyway. I winged it, and it worked out. But this was after months of struggling. I will not pepper my experiences it was less than pleasant, but I feel more in control of my life and that’s all I wanted.

Thank you again kind redditors!",16Feb2020,1

I need no support system as i have my own , with entities not of this world.  I do not need your advice , there is nothing you can teach me and i will not listen to you. My blood is not of this earth.  My power comes from within and i can hand little bits out , to those who deserve it and then you will crave it. Like a drug.

I’ve thought about it a lot and I don’t think I “hate” myself as much as I hate my past which made me how I am 

Gone through endless amounts of abuse, self hate, discrimination, people taking advantage, etc. not surprisingly it’s made me “broken” 

Growing up I always tried so hard to be “normal” as in trying to “fix” and “undo” the negatives that come along with ^ and I mean, it hasn’t totally been a waste of time. 

One thing I really love about myself is that I’m determined af. Growing up it was the one reason I didn’t kill myself/ self harm etc. I’d always be thinking about it and my determined side to survive would be like “stfu just get to the next day” 

I mentioned I’ve worked to undo some of the damage caused and to an extent I’ve been successful but there’s things that just can’t be fixed. 🤷‍♂️ 

IDFK. In another life where my childhood was normal I’d really love to be me, I’d be having the time of my life rn lmao

I'd have cut myself at least 5 times. I've only cut myself a few times one night idk 8 or 9 years ago. Of all places??? On my wrists. And I planned on it too. Got wine and wore bracelets for days after.

I was going to cut my stretch marks on my thighs. I still might. I fucking hate myself. I hate my thighs most of all. I have SO many fucking stretch marks there due to losing weight and gaining all that weight in just a few months, haha. Yay fucking eating disorders.

Generally what I do when I feel like this is I look up any videos on YouTube in shows and movies when the character cut themselves instead of doing it myself. This time?? I mean I'll do it as soon as I post this then delete it.

I wish I ate nothing today. Fucking fuck fuck. I could have passed out by now. I had ice cream, left overs, I am very very strongly considering going vegan just to restrict so much. Or vegetarian at the least. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. And then after that no more cheese!!!! 

I think while watching youtube videos soon I'll take some Tylenol PM or whatever and hopefully that'll knock me out.

I hate this. I hate myself. I hate that I'm like this. I recently got rejected so that sucks. I wanted to talk to the one person I have to talk to and that didn't even happen today and still isn't. It's for the best though. I'd ruin his fucking night.

19,"Let me start by saying, they're not gone, they're just so far gone in their mental state that they aren't themselves anymore. They've been watching Fox news since 2004 and it's been a slow decline... They've got all of the check marks for the classic fox news listeners. Racist, Trump worshipping Bible thumping southern Baptists. I guess I didn't realize how bad it had gotten until I got away from their environment for awhile. Honestly, for awhile they just about took me down with them into the ultra right wing fox news cult, but after I moved out and couldn't afford cable, and went without the news for a couple of years, I was sufficiently deprogrammed. They've only gotten worse. This election cycle (and back in 2016) I've been an avid Bernie Sanders supporter and they're still worshipping Trump like he's some kind of prophet. I know there isnt much I can do, I'm not a fighter, I'm not a confrontational person. When they rant I just daydream and fidget until they're done because I just don't know what else to do... I get so frustrated when they spout ignorance about history or science or climate change... It's starting to hurt, too, because sometimes when they demonize liberals, or non-heteronormative people, they have little to no idea that they're not just talking about my aunt and cousins, they're talking about me now, too. They speak with such disgust about people, and sometimes it's their own kid they're talking about. 
I'm not really asking for advice, it just hurts, and it's frustrating. I hate seeing my parents like this. If they knew the truth about me, that I'm a bisexual, non-binary Democrat, they'd feel as disgusted with me as they do with my other liberal relatives.

It made me even more sad to think that even if we could be a group again, none of us are the same person as they were back then. I haven’t been out of high school very long, just a few years. But in those few years, one person moved across the country to sell drugs, one had a falling out with drugs and moved schools (now living with parents again).

 All my friends got married and have kids. So they're there. But you know you grow apart.

As much as I felt like he cared about me, he would crap on it by abusing my mother emotionally, psychologically, mentally, sexually, and financially. That wasn't enough for 30+ years for him.

Twenty some years later, I am in a weird place. My mother has confided in me all my life and has discovered that my father has been providing for a younger woman who gets her rent and takeout paid for. We have the financial proof of this for the past two years. As my mother is not tech savvy, she is relying on me to somehow get picture proof and tail him consistently while tracking his location via cellphone and she plans to compile the financial evidence.

I have had many issues with my father but I feel that this crossed the line. He has more interest in paying for this lover than in my youngest sibling's education and wellbeing.

Most men a lot of places I've seen do, it's natural for a guy to prefer boobs and ass over a girl with a more ""boyish"" figure, again, for biological reasons. I've been bullied relentlessly mostly by guys for not having curves, and being small and ""flat"" in some of the ""important areas"". People are completely throwing thinner women down, saying they look ""anorexic"" like ""drug addicts"" ""bad role models"" ""flat"" ""boyish"" ""masculine"" women with curves are sexualized and praised a lot for their looks.

33,"TL;DR at the bottom..

It has always been like this, I go to sleep I forget anything and everything exists and there I am in the dream world completely conscious of this new.. me, environment and the people that I am surrounded by.

There is nothing else, and no matter how far fetched some of my dreams might be, absolutely every single thing that I experience, feels real. To the extent of mentally effecting me in the real world, I have become afraid of waking up, not because life is difficult but because I feel like either a part of me died or I don't know when I will be back in that world again.

In these dreams I developed friendships, fallen in love, met an old friend and watch them die just weeks later. It all feels so real, so much so that I have became so depressed and I don't know if anyone could understand.

I don't even wake in a panic attack if I fall to my death from a stairway to absolutely nothing in the middle of the sky. I lay there feeling all of the pain, my broken bones, the blood coming out of my nose and ears. Then I use the last of my energy screaming for help until everything goes black and it's just.. well, darkness. 

You may be wondering ""So.. you're awake now, how does that work if you can't tell that and dreams apart?"" OR ""What if you dreamt of a dragon, would that be real?""

My dreams influence my memory, at any time I can say someone has said something that they reassure me with compelete confidence that they never said anything like that. I have asked people about scars they have which well, they didn't have in the first place.

I have went to turn a corner to the next street I live by and be dumbstruck when nothing on that street is how I recall it.

The only way I can tell I'm awake is when I hear the rain, some days when it doesn't rain I run the sink tap. This noise is the only noise my mind can't replicated, as if it's pattern was too complicated. In my dreams running water sounds fractured and incomplete, like it is missing a sense of soul. It's hard to explain. 

I only have my partner and friend to speak to about this though it never really goes anywhere, it's just too much to speak about sometimes.

Yeah so, I know that's a strange one and I wanted to come out with it because I'm just getting so afraid now, I have thoughts of locking myself in a dream and now and again it works but I always wake up.

Is this some condition I don't know about?

TL;DR The world for me is something new everyday and it effects my memory of people, places etc. Rain or running water help me find reality. Sometimes (not always) feel suicidal when I'm awake because of my dreams.",16Feb2020,1

46,"Sorry this is gonna be a bit long. I’m 15 and the person who did it is one year younger than me, and he’s my step brother. I live with my mom and step dad, but I was visiting my dad when this happened. I was staying in a hotel with my dad, step mom, and step brother, and it was decided by them to have me and my step brother sleep in the same bed since there were only two beds in the room. In the middle of the night, I woke up multiple times to him touching me inappropriately. There was no way it was an accidental movement in his sleep; he was very obviously trying to touch me sexually. I told my dad the next day, and he didn’t seem to react much. We had a family talk/meeting about it, but as far as I know my step brother wasn’t even punished. He was 12 or so at the time of this happening, so he should know not to fucking assault someone, right? I tried to excuse it because teen boys have wet dreams and he was probably acting on his curiosity or something. He said he didn’t remember doing it and gave me the most insincere “sorry” I’ve  heard. My dad didn’t tell my mom about what happened, and since he didn’t, I thought it wasn’t a big deal so I didn’t tell her either. Even at that time, I was kinda upset nothing really happened to my step brother besides “don’t do it again,” but now I’m pissed that my dad didn’t do anything more. Now my step brother might think that he can just keep touching girls like this and get nothing more than a slap on the wrist, which I didn’t really think about until later. I didn’t ever talk about it again until yesterday, when me and my mom were talking about possible causes for my other health issues, and sexual assault came up, so I told her about it and her reaction was much more than what my dad’s was. She was very pissed at my dad for not telling her, but she was glad I finally did. I had one of my therapy sessions today, and my therapist agreed that more should have been done about the situation; we made a report at the appointment. I think CPS will be involved with them, and me and my mom might file a police report. I wish I had known sooner that it was a bigger deal than it was made out to be. Now I don’t know what’s gonna happen to my step brother and I guess my dad could also get in trouble for not reporting the incident when I told him. Now I’m scared my dad will choose to side with my step mom and step brother since he already lied and said he told my mom about it when it happened.  I know for a fact that is not true because of how she reacted when I told her. He also said I didn’t tell him all the things That I told my mom, which I am certain is not true because he was the first person I told, and I told him everything. This is also going to affect my visitation with my dad since I usually visit him over the summer. There was already tension between my step mom and me, and now there will be more along with the fact that my mom doesn’t want me to go there anymore anyways. I want my step brother to be punished, but I also don’t want to ruin my relationship with my dad. I’m glad I finally told more people, but I’m really stressed about what could happen or what my dad could possibly do in order to protect my step mom and step brother or himself since he already lied about it. I guess I’ve been finding out my dad isn’t really as good of a person as I thought he was.",16Feb2020,1

I started to find out I’m more attracted to guys than girls when I was around 13 or 14. I’ve never told anybody about how I felt because of the homophobic assholes out there or people with stupid religious beliefs. I had a crush on my friend back in high school (we are both male) and I honestly started to have feelings for him and just felt in love with him. I’ve never had the courage to ask him out because I would’ve been bullied pretty badly and I’m not sure if my friend is gay or not and I was afraid that was going to ruin our friendship if I were to ask him out. I just couldn’t take the risk. 

Also I remember sometimes another friend of mine would show me hot Instagram models and asks me if I would smash or pass. For some reason, I never once got attracted to those women and I would just pretend that I do and I would just play along with the smash and pass game.

55,"My bf of 6 years cheated 2x that I know of. I am definitely over him but the trauma he has caused me still affects me. 
Long story short, he got an STD. He never told me until after the breakup. 
Backstory: I had figured he was cheating but never could find anything in his phone or apartment. It was a strong gut feeling. 
It wasn’t until AFTER we breakup, I immediately go to the dr to get checked for stds bc I was gut feeling sure he did something.
*I didn’t have an std (thank god!)* but I was prescribed medicine but not for a std.
I wanted to know for a if he really had cheated on me, so I text him &amp; told him I got checked &amp; was prescribed medicine.
He THEN explains he got an STD when we were on a break 4 years back(2015) &amp; the treatment never worked bc he was getting symptoms again (2019).
He tried blaming me for his actions and std but that was him. Blaming his problems on everyone else except taking responsibility for his own actions.

It honestly hurts me that I stayed with him for so long. I’m perfectly fine with my life now. I’m happy. But I hate that I feel like a guy will turn on me like he did.

58,"Holy fuck that was incredible.

Plan started with just yoga. I picked her up at 430pm

Never been to the studio. Very homey and welcoming with is a great lavander aroma. Yoga class is pretty easy and really releasing for both of us. We both  bought a bunch of passes because of a deal, and basically have 4 months of classes paid for. 

After yoga I took her to the best hot chocolate in Chicago: Mindy's hot chocolate. There is no parallel.  The conversation was flowing like butter, about our histories, interests, homes. 

I proposed we get Serbian food, my motherland. Turns out she used to work at a Serbian restaurant and was dying to get some cevaps. I took her to my favorite spot, Beograd Cafe. We had a feast, every dish was delicious and prepared really well. 

Then came the blacklight pajama bowling party. We arrived around 930, pretty early but we claimed a lane and talked to some people. The dj was spinning some awesome chill trip hop. Tipper style. After an hour or two people packed the place and it went wild. The face paint artist did a great futuristic galaxy on my face. DJs were killing it with the breakbeats. 

The party shut down at 3am, when we moved to Charlie's, a gay bar in Boys town. Great time dancing til around 4am. 

Stopped at the taco stand outside for 20 minutes and ate some great tacos. 

I brought her back and pointed out we just had a 12 hour first date. She said she had a blast.

59,"23m/
My father and I have lived on and off together my whole life. We are really close I consider him my best friend..

Sometime around when I turned 15 he started selling heavy drugs. We would always smoke pot before nut nothing heavier..
Being around drugs my life I was excited to try everything, 
We should smoke amphetamines and do coke for years together. I would sell the weed and him the rest.

One day bikes ran through my house and smash up dad and I taking what they could find.. as they looked through the house with a machete To my throat. 

I moved away after that little dibarcle. I'm that time I would continue to use. Alot . Nearly everything.
But the worst for me was benzos, I developed chronic anxiety and depression for years. Making terrible mistakes that I still need therapy for.. 

Besides the point 

I've recently moved back with my father, he had stoped doing drugs due to his insomnia and tinittus. Frequently talking about suicide. He doing my spare key to my car so next time I stay out he would has himself..
Got the keys back and hid them obvs.

I've been seeing a therapist here trying to stay of benzos because I always go to hard and bad things happen, I am trying really hard but It is hard boo hoo for me.. there is a slew of pain killers sleeping pills benzos in the home at all time. 
Starting zoloft has helped alot to. 

But my Father is convinced crazy. Every time.i forget something Its because I'm on something apparently .

For the first few weeks I have been a happy zombie wake up, couch, YouTube.  Zoloft is doing this.. 

I enjoy takings stims  it makes me motivated, kind and a more well rounded person (lol )

So I told my father I got some stuff thinking he would be upset , nut no very excited to smoke pipes with me again.. We had a great time like always. The next day I feel great  he feels like shit... so now he doesn't want me to take anything. Being a good dad I guess? 
He got me into this shit
Not blaming him.. I'm my own person. 

From the amount of benzos I have abused I now find   it hard sometimes to tell what day something happen, I think more and I do. But it's hard.

And every time I say something that was wrong I'm harped for it.. 


I'm doing well I study I work part time im  a really nice person, he has turned bitter because he can't do what he used to and I can ..
I'm well aware drugs are bad I know.. but they help.i have limits and restraint.


I've already forgot what I've txts..  
All I know is I'm happy decrete and moving forward well in life no longer suicidal. 


Ahh fuck I don't know what else to say I'm just spewin feelings.. sorry for bad punctuation I'm typing this fast and probably because I'm a happy drug addict loser.

61,"I could go deeper in to detail but what's really on my mind is a couple days before valentine's to the present. 

I was buying a new toy for myself a couple days before valentine's.  My S.O. seemed a little irritated and asked if I still had enough for valentine's to which I replied yes.   She then said good cause I have a suprise for you.  

So after shelling out almost 150 bucks on her for valentine's, I found out my suprise was a outfit she purchased for herself a few days previous. 

No card, not box of chocolates, nothing.  

Whatever? Right? 

So then I ended up getting super sick the day after valentine's and last night I was waiting for her to get done with her friends.  

Well she got done around midnight and wanted me to drive her friend home at midnight when I'm feeling like death.  

As we woke up today she told me she going out with the same friend to deliver groceries.   Only thing is I've asked her several times and even though she knows I need the money, the reply was always no.  

I guess I'll just sit here sick and alone.",16Feb2020,1

I’m 19 and lack all sorts of morality and empathy to an extent. I was sad when my cat died but because I’d be alone at home not because I was sad for her, being sad over someone else’s suffering is a concept so foreign to me that I’m honestly cringing as I’m writing this. 
This ended up in me hurting a lot of partners I was with in the past which is an issue to me since I don’t really like being alone (I hate being with others too however I can only tolerate their presence for a couple of hours).

Suddenly the only thing I want is to be close to, and hugged by, someone who knows me, who’s known me my whole life. The loneliness is sneaky and it strikes without warning, when everything seems normal and fine.",16Feb2020,1
65,"Before i get in to the story i have to explain myself. I'm orthodox Christian, meaning I have to stand up for the entire liturgy without sitting. My parents had an issue with our local church where they stopped going because they said he skipped several parts of the liturgy for time, and called him ""illegitimate"" because he doesn't do them correctly, which u agreed with them on. Second, now, because there are no other churches in London or any closer with ""correct"" priests, every time my mom goes, we go somewhere more than 2 hours away since our church community is small where im from.

But here's the nail in the coffin. She doesn't want to drive there herself, insteas always having someone else drive her. This is usually the same guy who goes consistently every week, plus someone else from time to time. In order to get on time for 9 AM service, we have to leave by 7AM at the latest, meaning at our drivers place by 6:45AM, and wake up at 5:45-6:15AM at the latest to get their barely on time.

However, our driver recently became a priest, so now if I want to go with my mom(my dad stopped going because it's just too early, which she hates him for) I have to wake up at like 4:30AM-5:30AM to barely get their, when it was predicted that literally no one else would show up other than us.
Now, I'm a uni student in eng and im on reading week, meaning I have the week off, but constantly staying up late studying has fucked up my sleep rythm so much that i can't fall asleep until 3 AM, and now you see my dilemma. 1.5 hrs of sleep isn't enough, and i need to get rest for when i get back to uni from reading week.

Not only that, but ""real"" service as my mom puts it lasts 3,4, sometimes even 5 hours, and we have to stand for the entirety of it. When i complain legs hurt, or that i feel dizzy or tired due to lack of sleep, my mom just disregards it and asks how come she, a 56 year old woman can do it, but a young man can't, even though i feel my reasoning is completely fair.

Thirdly, after service, i legit just want to fucking go home, but always, and mean ALWAYS, they stay for like 4-6 hours eating a well prepared lunch and talking, which i guess would be fine if we didn't have to drive 2+hours to get home. At the end of everything we arrive at like 5PM  sometimes, or even 6 maybe 7 PM, which is already wasting an entire day doing church activities.

My mom always guilts me into going with her by saying that I'm not a religious person if i don't go or that i don't like god if i don't go. If i say no, she throws a tantrum, says she's having heart problems because I'm worrying her by not going. She has a habit of not letting things go and holding grudges, she even still bothers me sbout arguments we had weeks ago. I honestly think it might be her age since she never used to be like this when she was in her 40s. People say she's too into religious stuff, and she might be using god as a coping mechanism for the stress she's been through with my dad(unhappy marriage).

Conclusion:

I mean, it's not that i don't like religion or hod or church, it's just that i have trouble getting up earlier and surviving through the day  on 1-2 hrs of sleep. That and i don't want to waste basically an entire day at church. But i can't speak up because: A) we always have somebody drive us and don't want to leave before lunch, and B) my mom antagonizes me for never going( bc of uni, and sunday is my designated resting/refueling day) but i never spoke up before because i felt bad from her guilting me, and bc of her stressful home life leading to her growing obsession with religion as she ages and can't deal with her problems as much anymore. Keep in mind our driver,  the new priest, has 3 sons around my age and a daughter, who haven't gone in over a year for similar reasons. I'm not saying I'm perfect, I'm just saying i really don't want to waste part of my break from uni and engineering for stuff that isn't even really the liturgy  since most of it is lunch and socializing and transportation.

81,"this happened in around last august, i was 12 at the time (I'm 13 now), and by that time my dad said that i will wear the hijab. I said okay because i was very scared of him. THis thing happened to my sister (Let's call her X)  And shes in grade 12 now and she did that same thing. When school started this is what she does (And what i did) We have a driver (but we didn't before) but when we get out of the house we wear hijab but remove it in the car and the driver is fine with it. But when our dad used to drop us it was very complicated I won't get into it.

So in the start of January my dad found out about me &amp; my sister not wearing hijab because he ent to the parent teacher meeting. We got in a huge fight and btw, my dad is not the best dad and muslim in the world. He drinks, leaves at night to go to the club and come back wasted. My sister confronted him about it. She was brave, she said when he stops doing those things then she will wear it, but i didn't say anything at all, and he stormed out of the room with no conclusion. The day after we had school, he came to me in the morning and said that i'll wear hijab and this was my chance to fight him, tell him my opinion. I said i'm not going to wear it because I don't want to and that he should be a great muslim for me to wear it. He said, threatening me that ""He will come to school and will put it on my head forcefully in front of everyone."" I knew he wasn't going to do it so i said, ""sure."" (BTW we were talking arabic all this time). After that we had school. My dad came in once again. said that I will wear it. I said fine. But as you would think, I didn't.

He still thinks I wear it, but i'm scared he might find out again, So i want a solution to end this.

oh also btw i'm an atheist but he doesn't know.

TLDR: My dad forced me to wear hijab but i don't, he found out soon enough and we got in a fight and he still thinks i wear it.

NOT IMPORTANT: The reason i'm bringing it up is because today, my muslim friends said they were thinking of removing their hijab , and they're parents are fine with it. They wore hijab by themselves and no one forced them. It made me so jealous but they don't know about any of this.",16Feb2020,1

83,"I'm in my last year of school and I don't know what I want to do next year so my mom took me to a guidance counselor. 
She asked me some questions about myself and I was completely lost, I had NO idea what to answer. I was able to answer basics questions like ""What are your hobbies"" but then she asked me ""What do you like and what do you dislike ?"" ""What are you good at ?"" ""What are your flaws and qualities?"" ""What kind of person do you think tou are ?"" And I didn't know what to say so I told her that I had no idea and she seemed concerned, it made me feel weird. It was more than a month ago and I still can't answer these questions.

I also have experienced this kind of situations with my friends. For example it often happens when we talk about random stuff and everyone has an opinion, except me.

It is also very hard for me to do these online personality tests because I don't know which answer to choose, even the dumb tests like ""Which [...] character are you ?""

I don't understand because everyone else seems to know so many things, to have opinions about everything and to know who they are while I can't answer simple questions about myself. I'm completely lost, I feel so dumb for not being able to do that and I start to think that I don't have a real personality.

I know it's normal for some teenagers not to know who they are but I think it's more a 13~16yo thing and I'll be 18 in a few months so I feel weird.

I don't think I'm dumb or not cultivated, I read as many books as possible, I read a lot of articles about many things on internet, I have and I had a lot of very different activities,... So I don't understand what's wrong with me.

I don't think it's normal for a 18 years old not to be able to tell what they like or don't like. I am lost and I feel weird because none of my friends are like that..

Does anyone else feels like that ? Is that normal ?

I'm causing my pregnant wife to get stressed and angry and hurt because I can't remember what I said yesterday, but I will remember it later on after the need to remember it has passed. I don't do well in social situations, I always seem to not be able to hold conversations for long and don't add anything of value to the interaction.

My wife got upset and thinks she can't ask me questions, and that snowballed into much darker territory.

90,"I've been university security for a little over 2 years now. I started when I was 19 so that I could pay my way through college. We are part of the university's police department, so we're essentially students taught to use a radio, wear a uniform, and walk people home at night. This last bit is the biggest part of the job; the campus butts up against a college town that's rife with crime but not with street lamps. It really isn't a safe place, so if we're not walking folks home our job is to 'patrol' the campus and town and report anything that seems fucky.

My friends and I have been privy to a lot more things than we ever cared to see.

* Countless teenagers drowning in their vomit and oblivious to what's around them

* Domestic abuse
* Daylight and nighttime robberies
* Drunk drivers pushing 50 and playing pinball with parked cars on either side of the street
* Hit and runs
* Suicide threats as well as suicide attempts, both failed and successful
* Gang violence
* Deranged individuals with a gun roaming the streets and threatening to kill

And in the past week, one friend (19M) was the first person to find a hanged man after he was reported suicidal to the police, while another (19F) walked a very drunk girl home listening to her recount how she was raped earlier that night (this was quickly reported).

I'm not posting for recognition or bragging rights or any stupid shit like that. I'll admit that our affiliation with the police don't win us any favors, but I'm not trying to fight that here. I just want to get this off my chest and share my feelings for me and my friends about what we've gone through. I don't share these things with people I know because they'll tell me to stop working this job. But I've been here long enough to know, while 99% of the time I'm just a 21 year old with a radio, there's that 1% where myself and my peers are the only ones trained and available to do what needs doing.

I just needed to articulate my thoughts about this to people that don't work with me, and I didn't want it to be to someone that knew me. So I posted it here on a throwaway account. I'd appreciate it if you read this, even if you couldn't care less about what happens in our little slice of life; at least somebody outside the job will know about it, and that's all I really want.",16Feb2020,1

93,"To give you some background : I live in asia, so the expectations of doing well in school and going to a good university is really high here. 

Everything started going down hill for me in primary school, became friends with bad people, got peer pressured alot, gave up studying completely, etc. 

Then came secondary school, we have to attend 4 years of secondary school here in my country. 

Did really badly in the entire first year, began to actually study and wanting to do well for my parents in the second half of the second year. I saw my grades improving gradually which really motivated me to study harder. Then i got my first A since the start of secondary school, i was ecstatic.

Eventually, it was my last year in secondary school, and everyone in my year had to sit a national exam. I topped the entire school for my level, that’s where it started, i just felt relieved, i felt happy too of course but mostly relieved at that point of time.

I then enrolled to college, i got a 3.8s and 4.0s in my 2 years in college, and as usual I don’t get excited anymore i just feel relieved.

And i graduated just 3 days ago, and got a special award for being the top student for my course. 

And again i felt like that special award was just something extra and doesn’t really matter, i was just relieved that i did well.

I’ve tried searching online but can’t seem to get any results as to why i feel this way and i was wondering if anyone could help me out here.

94,"
I'm not quite sure how you perceive psychosis, but the way it manifests in me is not as obvious or disruptive as you may think. Hopefully, I can make my situation more relatable by comparing it to something nearly everyone has experienced, grieving. 

Death is painful by definition and, by definition, people try to avoid pain. 

Has a friend ever confided in you that they have conversations with their deceased pet, friend, family member? Have they ever said that their recent good fortune was an intervention by the super natural? I know even atheists who have suspended their disbelief for moments of relief.

I'd argue this is insanity because it is believing in something beyond observation and beyond explanation. 

However, you'd never sit your grieving friend down and say ""your deceased parents didn't contact you in your sleep."" You wouldn't insist that it was just ""a dream with no true significance."" Why? Because it would be considered cruel. And even if you were cruel enough to confront them for what accounts to harmless delusions, I doubt you'd be able to dismiss their supernatural encounters in their heart of hearts.

Perhaps you've never experienced or witnessed this. That makes sense. People tend to keep their ethereal conversations secret.

When I enter bouts of psychosis, it is due to extreme stress, which I have an incredibly low tolerance for. The effects are identical to a mourner talking with his dead parents. I have the sensibility to hide it. I can still go about my daily obligations, but in the back my head, I am willing beyond practicality to suspend my disbelief for some wild fantasies. 

This manifested in beliefs that I could build a robot in only 6 months, or that my neighbors are trying to steal my soul. In public, social pressures are stronger than my delusions. Privately, I might begin plotting, learning new skills or negotiating with ethereal entities. This can become time consuming and self destructive.

My insanity is situational. My therapist has said that medicine would be ineffective because I do not suffer from any biological deficiencies. I handle it by ensuring my life is calm and structured, but as a college student, that is not entirely in my control.

I guess you can think of what I go through as a rogue coping mechanism. One that makes me willing to suspend disbelief for absurd concepts. No matter what, my delusions are as private as I want them to be, and if I never told anyone, no one would know. Sometimes, I think about telling people outside my family and my school counselor. I told a close friend a limited version of my experiences and I was so relieved to be accepted.

I brought this up because a few days ago I had to miss class because I felt with my current level of sleep deprivation and stress, it would throw me into a full episode. 


I couldn't simply email my professor: ""I'm experiencing the onset of psychosis. I fear if I don't decompress, I might start waking up at 3am again and taking strolls through the forest, while eating vitamins like candy and talking to my very dead great uncle."" 



Because I have to hide the severity out of shame, it puts me into a difficult position where I cannot ask for the assistance that I need. Simply writing ""I am not feeling well"" to a professor is inadequate and prone to rejection. I don't want to be completely open, but I want to be accommodated because neglecting myself in these moments is self destructive, and almost always leads to self harm.

But it is difficult to ask for understanding when I have to hide and downplay my situation.",16Feb2020,1

104,"The actual story is a little more complicated than the title suggests. Basically, we broke up in early January, tried to be friends but it was too difficult, and hooked up twice after while trying no contact. I found out at the end of January I was pregnant. He was hammered, furious, punched a wall when I told him and literally threw money at me and said to get rid of it because I was going to ruin his chances with a new girl he was talking to and went into detail about how they had fucked in the backseat of his car the night before. I should mention he's extremely pro life so I was pretty shocked at his reaction. We fought pretty bad that night and both said hurtful things, and both apologized the next day but decided not keeping it was the best thing to do.

A few days later I was at the bar we always used to go to (not drinking, just hanging out with friends) and he came in with one of his friends and his friend's girlfriend. We'll call them Drake and Alli. I had never really liked them, because every time my ex (we'll call him Nate) was with them I was not invited along and he would end up blowing me off or being cruel. He had specifically told me they didn't like me and didn't want us together. It was like there was demonic energy at their house or something lmao. But anyway, I was sitting with some friends, including a male friend who we will call Rocky. When my ex came in, I'm not gonna lie I played it up like I was really enjoying my conversation with Rocky. My ex had told me he didn't have feelings for me anymore and had moved on so I wanted to test the validity in that statement. It's petty I know but I'm not above it and I'm sure you've all done something similar. He was visibly uncomfortable and left after about 5 minutes, at which point Alli came over and sat down beside me. She said she felt like we got off on the wrong foot and we talked for a long time about things Noah had said to them about me. He had basically pitted us against each other for no real reason. She told me she'd read a super long letter I wrote him which was very personal and she and Drake and their other roommate (we'll call him Jason) had been trying to convince him to get back with me and that she knew my situation and felt terrible. At that point, Nate texted me saying he was coming back to pick Alli and Drake up and needed a hug from me.

I went outside and gave him a hug. He cried and held my stomach and was clearly super drunk. Alli said Nate and I should come back to their house and sleep and Nate agreed. I drove us all back and we hung out at their house for a while and then Nate and I had sex on the couch all night and he cried for like 2 hours after about how stressed he was and how he still loved me and I was his and kept asking ""are we gonna be parents?"" I held him all night and told him it was going to be okay. The next day we got lunch, he had his arm around me the whole time, and then drove me back to my car and we said we'd see each other the next day for a Super Bowl party at Alli and Drake's. He seemed hesitant like he wasn't really sure he wanted me to come, but they had invited me and he said I could. The rest of the day and Sunday afternoon were kind of odd. He was texting me but seemed withdrawn and sad but did say he loved me. The night of the Super Bowl was great. We cuddled on the couch and he was very affectionate and whispered to me several times how excited he was to be a dad. We stayed at Drake and Alli's again and were up all night, all 4 of us plus their roommate Jason just talking and having fun and working through a bunch of problems we all had. He told me he loved me and wanted to be with me regardless if we had the baby or not, that the girl he had been talking to he didn't even like and was done with her, and that they didn't even have sex and had only hung out sober once and it was awkward. I was hesitant. I said I didn't want him to feel forced into getting back with me, and he said he wanted to anyway.

We woke up the next day and went shopping for baby stuff, went to look at an apartment we could move into together, went to my friends to watch the Bachelor and then he stayed at my place. We were back together, from what I could tell. The next week and a half were odd. One day he would say he wasn't sure if he could do it, he felt it was moving too fast, he didn't have any motivation to hang out with me like he used to and he couldn't picture himself marrying me. The next day he would call me his ""pregnant wife"" and say he loved me. This went back and forth until he finally said for sure he doesn't want this and we can't be together or have the baby. I begged, because I had gotten used to be being back with him and had gotten very attached to the baby, but he still said no. He got belligerently drunk that night, was extremely mean to me, joking about traumatic things that have happened to me and telling him he wished he had never met me and all my problems are his fault and that he wants to die because of me. Keep in mind, I'm not a perfect person but except on 1 occasion after our breakup I was EXTREMELY loving, caring, understanding and compassionate toward him. I told him I would always be there for him and that no matter how he feels I still love him and he can always come to me. He called me that night saying every time he drinks he wants to sleep beside me but it means nothing. I said I'd come over but he said not to, and I didn't, and then we didn't talk for a few days.

This past Monday, he came into the bar again (I promise I'm not there all the time we just pick the same nights to go) with a friend from work. We politely smiled at each other but didn't speak for about an hour. I was over talking to his dad's friend, who is pretty close with both of us and knows the situation. Nate came over and was ""jokingly"", but actually kind of angry that his dad's friend and I were laughing and joking around. He play fought him and then the friend walked away and Nate said ""I want to kiss you right now"" so he did. And then we went outside and kissed a lot more and then decided to leave together (my choice actually). We went to the hotel we went to on the very first night we started dating and had (sorry) the most kinky wild sex of our lives. I was joking about how I had hooked up with his ex best friend (I didn't, but we had talked since the breakup about how sad we both were). He said if I ever did that he'd never speak to me again and I asked why he cared and he said several times ""because I still love you."" We cuddled all night and had sex again the next morning and then he took me home, gave me a kiss, and left. We texted a little bit here and there that week, but he seemed in a really bad mood a lot of the time and said we needed to stop going back to each other. He said he had moved on for a reason and it wasn't healthy, that he was using me for sex and I meant nothing to him. So I stopped responding to him. On Thursday, he came into the bar again. This was the same day he had said all that shit, so I was pretty pissed off and feeling petty again. Rocky was there, so I kissed him several times and danced with him in front of Nate. I'm not proud of it, but it happened. I guess I just wanted to see if what he was saying about meaning nothing to him was true.

I woke up the next morning to texts saying ""how's Rocky's cock??"" ""SLUT"" ""lmao have fun with that slut"". I tried to respond and found I was blocked, so I DMed him on twitter telling him he had no right to speak to me that way (and said some other mean things) and he blocked me on there too. I am still pregnant, and very confused.

I'm in such a dark place that I went to a psychic. No joke. And I honestly trust her because she could recall so many SPECIFIC details about both of us and both of our lives and she didn't even have my name. She says the pregnancy would be healthy should I decide to continue it, but that she doesn't feel it's the right time. She said he has multiple personalities and he is my soulmate but he's going to take a lot of patience and work, and that he doesn't mean the hurtful things he says. I don't know what to think.

What should I do?

The group therapy was great at reducing stress with the routine every day. I would like to have a routine in my community where I'm in my apartment less of the week. I dont know why I cant feel ok with myself and I beat myself up so bad. But at least I have the goals, I'm just nervous whether I can attain it.",16Feb2020,1

I’m an EMT, ppl constantly make jokes like if X happens there are paramedics right here. I jokingly and untimely responded to someone’s comment, “We can’t do anything about brain damage.”

110,"I moved two hours away from my home to go to school and I had to drop out because I could no longer afford the loan and I lost my housing. I was working a part time job and I couldn’t afford my bills, so I found something full time in the area and moved in with my boyfriends family.

I found a job now, I make $15/hr full time and I’m doing the best I can saving, I have about $1800 in my savings and I’m able to pay my bills but I’m so unhappy with my living situation. I miss my mom so much but I know I could never move back in with her. And I don’t want to move back to that town because there’s no opportunities like where I live now. But I’m so depressed. I miss my family.

My boyfriend is supportive but obviously there are some things I wish I could change. I’m comparing my situation to everyone else’s and I know that’s my fault but I’m so sad. I don’t know how to change my life and I feel like I’m stuck in this position forever.",16Feb2020,1
111,"I actually love the look of glasses. But I’m very very near sighted so when I put them on my eyes look smaller. It’s not super crazy but it makes a big difference to my overall appearance. When ever I get new glasses and find a pair I like they always look better before my prescription lenses are put in them. When I switched to contacts I got so many compliments. People said I looked so much better and like a different person. I felt really good about it because they were complimenting my real appearance. If someone said I looked better in glasses I’d be like hmm......

Anyway it made me never want to go back to glasses and now that I have to wear them I absolutely hate it. I have to do dramatic eye makeup just so my eyes don’t look small and beady.",16Feb2020,1
112,"I really wished the state tax forms are improved, so that we can actually type text into the blank fields. My state, Massachusetts, doesn't do the same thing that the IRS is doing.

When using the IRS tax forms, if you open the forms up in, let's say, Chrome Browser, Mozilla Firefox, or even Adobe Reader DC, the forms let the user click on the text fields and the user can just start typing stuffs into them.

After typing the text in, I can then print out the IRS tax forms with my entered text, and I get the final printed version with everything filled in.

For state tax forms, it's just a blank paper that you literally print them out, and I would need to either manually write them all out, or I have to use Adobe Reader DC's boxed text fill feature to get my information digitally printed onto the tax forms.

Why couldn't the state tax forms be updated, so we can all use the digital text field fill in feature that PDFs are using right now? 

It just annoys me sometimes.",16Feb2020,1
113,"I don't know what to do with myself. I've been uneedingly cold to my friends, super agressive and seeking conflict with them. 

We had an argument over something meaningless during a discord call. I was being really agressive, which i've for some reason been a lot recently, while they where being reslly calm, which made me more angry. We decided to just stop talking about the subject. And after that tears just started pouring down my face. I left in a hurry and have been crying for over half an hour, I don't even know why i'm crying in the first place.

114,"This AMA can't take place on /r/IAmA because I would need to proof my identity and that's just not something I'm going to do, so I'm going to do it here. I hope this is allowed.

Ciao, my name is Salvatore, or Sal. I live somewhere in Europe, but not in Italy. People call me something that translates to The Prince, because they think of me as a prince of the ""family"", not because I can sing ""Purple Rain"" very well, because I can't. Allegedly my father is part of the alleged Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra. If the Camorra had the same structure as the alleged Sicilian and American ""Cosa Nostra"" mafia, the one you know from the movies, then my dad would allegedly have the rank equivalent to ""Caporegime"" or ""Capo"". 

I know I say ""allegedly"" a lot. These things have been alleged by law enforcement. That being said, I, my father, or anyone I know, are not currently wanted anywhere for any alleged crimes.

I am an American citizen, living in America, but, you see, my best friend was a Pakistani.

So, a couple of months ago, he and his family went back to Pakistan for a vacation. He was in Islamabad, and, as his mom told me, went to Kashmir. While he was there, a terrorist group attacked the area, and he was among the people killed.

124,"I have no clue if I can post this here but I don't know where else to go and I've been crying about this all day.

 My friends have been saying for a while now that they think i have ADHD, they joke around about it a lot but it makes me really paranoid because i've read up a bit on adhd and i have a lot of the ADHD 'symptoms' and my brother has ASD and we are similar in the way that we act.

It's beginning to really scare me that its possible i could have it and i don't want to mention it to my parents or anything but i don't know what to do because getting myself tested for this stuff (idk if u can even do that) would probably clear a lot of things up but im way too scared and paranoid for that.

I don't know what I'd do if i was told i have it.

125,"I have this bad habit of immediately isolating myself from people once I discover something about them I don’t like. Maybe it’s a defense mechanism, I don’t know. But if I sense something that rubs me the wrong way, I estrange myself and just turn myself off from them. I suspect that this causes them to get the feeling that I’m not interested so they act sort of cold and apathetic towards me, or tend not to include me in things. In turn, this makes ME think that I’m disliked, annoying, or unappealing, and makes me feel even more ostracized and want to be alone. Sometimes I simply question why people don’t act more inclusive towards me and it makes me believe that none of this is my fault and that they’re just being inconsiderate. It makes me lose faith in making friends altogether.

The thing is, I admit I’m hard to please. I can only be friends with very specific kinds of people. I can start chatting to someone new but then immediately be turned off by something as small as the manner in which they talk or beliefs about a specific issue or how they present themselves (if they come off over-confident or obnoxious, for example). I try to justify to myself that these reasons are important enough to reject the prospect of befriending the person, but sometimes I question this. I’d have to find someone who is EXACTLY like me (in beliefs, interests, and personality), or else it’s just not worth it. And to be honest, I’m not even sure I would like such a person if they existed. 

I tried to connect with people different from me and it’s usually agonizing. But I also started a master’s program a few months back and was feeling hopeful about finding likeminded people there. But I actually dislike most of the people in the program as they aren’t at all what I envisioned them to be. They seem disinterested in the subject matter completely and only gossip and talk about vain things when they get together. I feel like the only one who wants to discuss interesting things I just learned! I just want someone who shares my passion for this subject and gets just as excited to talk about it as I do. I just feel lonely and isolated all the time, like a sore thumb. But since I wasn’t even able to make friends in my master’s program, I’m beginning to think I’m the problem.",16Feb2020,1
