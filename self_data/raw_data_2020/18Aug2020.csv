0,". . because there’s only one major achievement that I am proud of since then. That would be graduating high school at an early age. I’m so lostttttt. I’m a (19f) and I have no job (although I have a few interviews lined up to be a warehouse worker for now) and I dropped out of college. This might sound cliché but college just isn’t for me. Which automatically makes me a failure in the eyes of my family and I am afraid of being kicked out soon. I just do not know what’s next for me. I would feel the best if I had some type of career going. I’ve been considering a trade, I just don’t know where to start honestly. I feel so lost. I stay in the house everyday with nothing to do and it’s my fault. I’m a failure (and a bit dramatic lol). But seriously, everyone is disappointed in with me,

3,"I discovered pornography through the internet very early on in my youth. I wasn't old enough to be able to ejaculate yet, but I knew that looking at it made my penis hard. I'm not sure if that had too much of an influence on anything, but I feel like it's worth noting. I was around 10, I think puberty had started for me. She was about 8. We were very close for a while, so far that we would sleep in the same bed. Recently at that time, I had learned I was able to ejaculate and I started masturbating. I had started to get nightly erections, some of which were while my sister was in my bed. We both didn't know what what we were doing but we started engaging in sexual activities. We started with ""playing doctor"", touching each other, then we moved onto worse. I made her lick me on the genitals, she sat on my face, I penetrated her in the anus. I didn't penetrate her vagina at all which I'm thankful for but I don't know if that matters much. I had forgotten all about it until recently, my sister told me she remembered. I remembered too, and I was terrified. She thinks it had an adverse effect on her, which I don't blame her for. She believes her anxiety and unwillingness to be open about her problems and feelings come from that, and I can understand that. I'm not trying to justify my actions, I didn't know it but I really did something horrible. She wants to tell our mother about what we did tomorrow, and she wants to seek professional help. I don't know what to do, I'm terrified that I'm going to be outcasted by my family or worse. I had no idea I inflicted such psychological damage onto my sister. I need advice, I don't know what to do.",18Aug2020,1

7,"My bf comes from a wealthy family from the northeast. His family lives in an area with many rich people, celebrities, politicians, etc... He and I actually met online, through mutual FB friends. I wasn't actually aware of any of this stuff until the day I went and visited him in his hometown. I felt so out of place when I finally met his family. Although he and I have now been together for 8 years, I have always felt that his parents really wanted him to stay with his ex girlfriend. His Ex gf comes from a family of bankers, politicians, tv producers, etc. I won't mention names for privacy reasons of course, but let's just say they're people who pop up on google search right away when you type in their names. It's been tough feeling inadequate, not only amongst his family but thinking that he was probably better off with the other person, especially during times of struggle. However I won't pretend that he doesn't have a cushy safety net to fall back on, I just think that sometimes he probably thinks ""I can do better than this"", since I'm poor &amp; all.

9,"2 months before lockdown I finally (after 5-6 years?) tried to get help for my mental health, and part of that was pretty bad social anxiety. I don't really have friends, and when I think about it I never really have had friends and I've always struggled as a kid with social situations (which is normal for a lot of kids but I guess it never went away, and kind of only got a lot worse). Anyway, I got offered a short term cbt thing (like 2 months before lockdown) which i was relieved of a couple of weeks into lockdown (theres high demand for it and it was free so it was never going to be forever). Admittedly, although I stated everything, I sugarcoated how deep a lot of my feelings were with my counsellor. At the start of lockdown, I was obviously quite scared and lost like everyone really, but then it wasn't so bad - I was in my absolute element (though I did have to move back home which made things a bit difficult to get used to) but I picked up a few new hobbies and wasn't missing out on much since I never really had people to meet with anyway. But recently I've been feeling so down. Lockdown is mostly lifted (though it shouldn't really be, but this is the UK) but, as I said, I don't have anyone to go out with really, and my parents almost always stay indoors (one works, the other I'm pretty sure is depressed and/or stubborn) so going outside hasn't really been an option for me (of course I could go out alone, but since I was still doing cbt when in lockdown, I hadn't had much of a chance to put it into practice which made me retreat into my little confort bubble and I'm pretty sure my anxiety has worsened). I go to uni, so this next semester was suposed to be a complete fresh start to meet people (to be honest, without covid, I probably still wouldnt have met anyone new, but covid and social distancing has just made it almost inpossible) so I'm not sure what else to do really. I find myself feeling very lonely on the regular. Sometimes I muster up the motivation to go out by myself, go on a hike or whatever, but I can't escape the feeling of just complete loneliness. I wish I had people around me but I've never really truly experienced what other people have. I'm not that open with my family, and we do get on but it's not the same as having other people to talk to outside of your family.

Lockdown has made me realise a few things that I need to change (and helped me process some unhealthy thought processes that happen when I'm anxious), but I'm worried that, since I've had no oppurtunities to practice, it will all collect and be so overwhelming once I'm back at uni being independent and i will break down every time I try (this happened last year). I want to force myself to go out, to a coffee shop (a BIG no no usually), get my hair cut, and start going on runs (in quiet areas with no people to watch, but it's a start). But I'm terrified I won't be able to do it. I'm scared because I don't know when or if anything will ever go back to normal. Will I ever be able to experience socialising without anxiety? I want people to be around, to experience things with, even if that's just going for coffee once in a while. 

It sounds stupid but at one of my complete low points, I had absolutely nobody to talk to (and still don't! But I've tried to adapt) and started talking to a soft toy and genuinely began to feel as if it were real. I couldn't leave the house without kissing it goodbye and telling it where I was going - it was my absolute everything and the only ""person"" I really had to talk to in real life. I don't want that to happen again. 

I feel so fucking lonely I can barely cope sometimes. Sometimes I feel myself going about my day to day life and being ""happy"" but can't help but feel just numb somewhere inside. But next semester was supposed to be my time to rise and I can't help but think I will hit an even bigger low once I get my independence back. I'm going to take one massive step back and not be able to cope and I don't know who to talk to when that happens. I feel moderately okay at the moment (not RIGHT now, obviously, but in general) but I know that's because lockdown has been somewhat of a safety blanket from the world. And I will experinece a sudden drop from one of the more relaxed times in my life to probably one of the lowest times in my life. I can see it coning and I don't want to go through it. I'm scared, because I don't look after myself when those things happen, I don't care for much danger or for anything really. And I don't want to be that vulnerable.

Tl;dr: basically I have lifelong fomo and my social anxiety and loneliness is making the thought of post-lockdown unbearable",18Aug2020,1

15,"r/offmychest automatically removed this based on ""being tied to Black liberation."" Not sure why, since this has nothing to do with that at all. 

**Possible trigger warning**: I will be using male pronouns to refer to my dad, even though he transitioned and lived as a woman. I'm not trying to be insensitive. He's my dad.

When I was two years old, my parents divorced because my dad believed that he was meant to be, and live, as a woman. Obviously, at a young age, I wasn't able to rationalize what was happening. My sister and I grew up with this being the *norm* in our family. Growing up, my sister and I would go to our dad's house every other weekend and spend time with him. He would take us to festivals, fairs, baseball games, nice restaurants, and a lot of other fun places. Though I enjoyed the things we did together, I never truly enjoyed spending time *with* my dad; especially as I got older. I remember one weekend where my mom had something come up and we had to go to dad's house two weekends in a row. I was so angry and distraught that we were being forced to go. I wanted to hang out with friends, who were around every weekend, while I wasn't. When I was able to drive and had a job, I would make excuses or schedule shifts so I wouldn't have to go to dad's house on the weekend. Once high school sports and other things started piling up, our every-other-weekend setup fell by the wayside and we would find time - about once a month - to make our way over to dad's. I didn't realize this then, but there were a lot of emotions that I had been ignoring, suppressing, harboring, whatever you want to call it.

Six years ago, when I was 21 and living in NYC, I finally was able to acknowledge and recognize the feelings that I had toward my father, and...I was not happy with what I found. I was angry that he destroyed our family with his decision. I was angry that I had to go through life with this dark, embarrassing secret. I was angry about how much it must have hurt my mom. I was angry that he was so selfish to place his own desires over the needs of our family; over the needs of me, his son. *Why didn't he want to be my father? What was so wrong with us, that he decided to step away?* All these questions - rooted in anger and hate - had been in my subconscious my whole life. They had been forming my attitude toward my dad and forming the way I acted around him; cold.

You see, it wasn't just that my parents divorced. If it was just that, I could have lived with it. But the fact that they divorced and then my dad decided he was going to live as a woman...it seemed doubly apparent that he didn't want to be a dad to me in any respect. This was the seed of a lie that I had been believing my whole life; *I am not worth the sacrifice and I am not wanted as a son.* Humans believe many lies about ourselves, but this was the worst one that I have let take hold of me. This lie had shaped my identity for my whole life, and I was sickened by it. I made a heartfelt act of forgiveness towards my dad and I rejected all the lies that I had believed about myself as a result of my dad's decisions.

When I was 25, my dad got a serious lung cancer diagnosis. He was given an 80% chance of living another two years, even with chemo and radiation therapy. After hearing this, I decided to move back to Minnesota, live with my dad and step-mom, and take care of my dad in whatever way was needed. For the first six months of being back, my dad was still working so my days consisted of dog-sitting, cooking dinner, and keeping the house clean while my dad and step mom were at work. After that period, my dad started to decline and was put on long-term disability. We were home together all day and as his condition got worse, he became less and less himself. His cancer had metastasized from his lungs to his brain, bones, and liver. I took him to his daily radiation sessions, and his other doctors appointments/check-ups. Soon, he wasn't able to walk and his mental state was deteriorating. He had hallucinations often. I was watching him play Skyrim one day (oh yeah, dad loved Skyrim) and he stopped and asked if I also saw that the walls had turned purple and fuzzy and if I saw the ceiling drip onto the carpet. I answered in the negative and dad said, ""Oh right, cancer in the brain."" Soon he was rambling about this and that and it was impossible to have a coherent conversation with him. At his next check-up, we got the prognosis that he had between four and six weeks left to live. What did dad want to do? Go to Mexico!

Fast forward three weeks and my dad, step-mom, and one of their friends are on their way for a quickly planned trip to Mexico. I would have preferred to go instead of their friend, because - as we had found out in the last few months - I was the only one strong enough to lift dad up out of his walker or pick him up off the floor if he happened to fall. But...they didn't ask me to come along. in hindsight, I don't think dad wanted to die in front of me. And die he did. They went to their favorite island off the coast of Mexico, a place they had gone to every year for the past 12 years. Dad died within five hours of being there. That was where he wanted to die. He just didn't tell anyone. I will forever remember dropping them off at the airport. I got dad in his walker, I looked at him and I said, ""I love you dad, and I'll see you in five days."" We made eye contact, and he said, ""I love you too, son."" But there was something in his eyes that said, *I love you, but no, you won't see me again.* As I drove back home, I knew that that was the last interaction I was ever going to have with him, and I got the call five hours later.

Dad died two years ago and I am still processing a lot of these feelings. My deepest regret was that I didn't take advantage of those first six months, when dad was still 100% there, and have this conversation with him. It would have done so much healing for our relationship. Or wouldn't it have? I don't know. Maybe it is best that these long buried hurts didn't come up. I don't know. My family as a whole is pretty closed off to emotional subjects, so I haven't really been able to talk about this stuff. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

6 months ago my face got larger looking mainly around the cheeks and middle of face) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. 

Recently I went down to 11.3 again and jogged  but hardly any difference definitely but looks larger too. as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head and my body seems larger overall too. . It’s difficult to get below 11.3 stone even with fasting tbh so that’s the threshold. 

◾️Black pants I wore a few months ago for work seem tighter and my legs look more longitudinal in them around the bottom half of legs. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting mostly too and it’s made me drop on the scale but can’t see a difference) I try eating between 6-8pm and that’s it.  I was a few lbs more in 2018 and look thinner and thinner faced and clothes fitted better. 


◾️I went down to 11.2 but after 1 meal and dessert I was up to 11.10 is that normal?

17,"I'm writing this post because I feel weird about my life right now. It's good, but really empty and I want to know what you'd be telling yourself and doing if you were me.

I'm a freelance designer, which I love. I was living overseas in Asia kinda travelling around until Covid-19 happened and then I came home to my parent's house on the outskirts of a very minor city. I had to leave behind a lot of my friends. It also broke up my relationship which sucked.

Pandemic wise, everything's been okay here for a while. I have enjoyed reconnecting with my family. All I really want to do is get back to travelling and solo travel the world while I work.

If you were me - what would you do? I love what I do for work, but it's really lonely. I've thought about getting a job but the economy's not great and I like the freedom I have freelancing. I sometimes hang out with my high school friends but we don't have much in common anymore. 

I'm thinking about going back to the gym. I'm thinking about saving up and buying something cool like maybe a vintage car but I really should just save for travel again. I could do some domestic travel? I don't really have anyone to go with but I could go by myself. I don't think I want to study or increase my debt. I could find a club to join maybe but my city's so small - so doing what? Maybe I should get on Tinder? I don't think I want a real relationship though, just attention. It's hard to be motivated to do that when the future's so uncertain.

Basically I feel really stuck in a rut. Overall I know I'm really lucky to have stable work and a loving family but it's depressing being back in my hometown and not really having any solid friends here. I just want to know what you'd be focusing on and telling yourself if you were in my shoes.

Please feel free to chime in and give some advice.

2008: Took first college class

2010: Graduated (associates)

2012: Got accepted into pharmacy school

2016: Supposed to graduate, but got arrested for a felony, eventually got probation which meant that I could not proceed in my program. Thus, \~$220,000 in the hole + \~7.9% APR and a HUGE depression.

2016: Reenroll to school for accounting.

2020: About to graduate this YEAR but realize I HATE everything about accounting. I am 29 this year. Totally wish I could go back to 2016 and choose computer science instead. SUPER regretting not choosing computer science or something entirely different of a major.

Now I've got a family, a child to feed, and I'm stuck in this major that I hate, and it's WAY harder for me to find the time, mental stamina, energy, and will to learn something new and or enroll in a new program. I'm 100% certain that I, without a doubt, hate accounting, and I have no idea what to do from here on out.

My life situation has been absolute crap and the trajectory has gone so downhill that I'm literally extremely depressed and cannot even fathom getting out of bed each and every single day. It's horrible. I think I'll either die from a stress-related illness or eventually commit suicide (thanks to religion this hasn't been an issue for me).

34,"My boyfriend broke up with me just now. He didn't explicitly come out and say it.  We were together almost 2.5 years on and off and he had previously ended it twice to ""focus on himself"" which he never did. We had gotten into an argument on Sunday because I tried to consider his feelings and he told me that I was telling him how he felt. Then he didn't want to see me and he didn't talk to me at all for the past day except to say that he wanted to take space but didn't want to break up. I went over an hour ago after he ignored me repeatedly. I'm an idiot so I truly thought we would talk things out when I got there, and he had all my stuff packed up and he first told me that he just decided he needed space but didn't want to break up, then he said that he was going to break up with me tomorrow, then he said that he felt this way a while, then he said that he just decided within the past day. He told me that he loved me too much and was always thinking about me and cared about me so much and that even though he didn't show it, I was his world, and because of that he just couldn't work on himself and be with me because he would put all his effort into us. 
The reason we argued on Sunday was because he wouldn't tell me how he felt about something when I asked and then flipped it around on me. 
He is and was my best friend and Ive known him for over half a decade. I love him so much and I feel physically sick. I don't want to be broken up and I don't want to lose him. He said that he still wants to be in my life, but I just can't. I love him too much and I won't be able to be with him the same way. I will hold out hope that we will get back together or that he will change his mind. Everyone around me is telling me that he was shitty or that he was treating me badly or that I deserve better. And I know he was being shitty, I know that he shouldn't have been ghosting me for the last day or two. I know that. But I love him. And he made me happy. And now I feel like I'm in a bad dream. But I know every day is going get worse because I'm going to miss him. I'm sorry for rambling. I just feel like absolute shit and I feel like I'm going to throw up, I feel like my heart is gone. I feel like none of this makes any sense and that people don't just decide one day that they're going to end things after planning a future together. I feel like we were fine and happy and people don't just fake happiness and intimacy. But they do. And it sucks. I don't think I ever want to love anyone ever again.

35,"I can’t concentrate on work, working remote the past 6 months. It’s been bad lately.

I’ve been obsessed with researching disorders, moods, make up looks, trendy teenage shit to try out even though I’m almost 30, true crime, and ghost stories in the last month. rapidly.

I have been off my social media for months and suddenly I get on one time this weekend over all platforms and it sucked me back in that fast. Even shit-posting a few times a day and talking to strangers through comments which I never do. Even hardly do on reddit! But I seek socializing. ..even validation (ugh).

Being away from social media and coming back makes me realize how polar opposite everyone is suddenly with the state of the world and it’s made me realize maybe I don’t very-well associate with these people anymore like I thought I use to. To be fair, it’s all fake and electronic anyway. over FB. And that feeling is also not JUST because of the state of the world either. I just don’t click after force-separating myself from it all. Yet I'm constantly refreshing everything every few minutes, it’s fucking maddening!!! Nothing is good enough.

I was doing great. So good. I had a routine. I was brushing my teeth. I was working out. Eating vegetables instead of pop tarts. And now I’m back to it all. What happened?!

44,"Lotteries were never my thing. I always felt like my luck sucked. Since 3rd grade, I realized I was never lucky. I got the worse friends, the worst chances.   


My birthday was recent and I was looking forward to messages from friends that said they would stay in contact during quarantine, (Despite my best efforts, they never replied back to me, and if they did it was after a week.) but I didn't get a single message. My parents were going to get me a cake, but all the places were closed or out of the cakes. Then they took me out to eat. There, they didn't have the only thing I wanted so they offered a free dessert. I asked for chocolate cake but they were totally out. So we head home where I'm watching my favorite anime when my brother messages me to go to my parent's room. I thought it was another surprise, and well, it was one but not a good one. My dad was talking about leaving and wanting to divorce my mom. I saw the tears in my brothers' and mother's eyes, and I just watched. It was.... heart breaking. I didn't cry, or react, or anything. I just stood there and accepted it. All I kept telling myself was I knew this was going to happen.   


For a while now, I've picked up on the ways my parents treated each other. Subtle things only people ""in the know"" could notice. If you weren't, you'd rub it off as a joke or awful banter. This wouldn't be the first time my parents talked about divorce or my dad trying to walk out (in those times my mom explained ti me what was happening) so I was in the know. I heard the way my mom insulted my dad, the weight of each word she said. She'd usually do it under her breath, or subtly over the dinner table. I saw the way my dad reacted. Short fuse, always on the defense ready to combat anything thrown at him. The thing that sucks is I never said anything. This ""argument"" spans nearly two decades.   


My dad did wrong and my mom will never forgive him. It's not okay what he did, but the way she treats my dad isn't right. Day after day is torment for him. I understand why she would make him feel that kind of pain, but it won't change things for the better. My dad is too irrational and unreasonable to talk to. He is always right and correct in his judgement so any one opposing him is wrong, stupid, and ignorant.  


They're still together, and I don't know if it is for the better. I know that isn't my decision, but I feel bad for my brother who gets near to having an anxiety attack every single time they break into an argument. I see the pain they all go through. My mom doesn't want him to leave but wants to cause him pain, my dad doesn't want to stay but doesn't want to cause pain, my brother doesn't want him to leave, and my other brother wants this to stop.   


I seriously can't wait to move out. I need a job but I keep getting rejected everywhere I apply. Having no experience sucks. I just want to feel lucky.

45,"I just gotta get this out of my chest so I can hopefully go to sleep feeling better. Even if it ends up being a draft I felt a need to document what I'm feeling right now and it's pathetic because I'm aware that I'm priviledged in a lot of ways and I hate being that guy who whines about stupid issues but hopefully I can post this without bothering anyone.

Anyway back to how I'm feeling. I was just going to sleep after working overtime (it's 3 am here) because I hate letting down my boss and I've been doing that constantly for the past 1 or 2 weeks and he's also thorough when it comes to making me realise and own up to that which makes me feel stupid, useless and worthless. 

I am crying for no reason, or like not for no reason but it's kinda sudden or like not triggered by anything I saw or thought about. 

I take my 3 meds that I gotta take every night before going to bed which makes me feel like an ill person that's dying even though they're not for anything serious, that's just what I feel when I take them.

I turn off the lights in the living room and it's silent as fuck except for my crying which sounds a bit like muffled laughter. It sounds sad tbh. 

I take off my jacket and the change of temperature feels like my skin is burning. It also feels like the jacket weighs a thousand pounds.

The past few days I'd been delaying getting my cream for my skin allergy. Today I looked too much like shit because the itching had swollen my eye so I got it delivered. That's the fourth ""med"" I gotta use and that makes me sad too. 

I get in bed, well not really in bed because it's only a mattress 'cause I've also been delaying getting a bed because I'm comfortable like this and no one visits me.

Here's the most pathetic part: I put on asmr videos of people (women) that whisper positive affirmations because I wanna go to sleep feeling like I'm not the worthless piece of shit my boss probably thinks I am. 

Finally I'm off to sleep but hey I have sleep apnea so it doesn't matter whether I sleep 2 hours or 20, I'll still probably be tired in the morning.

And then it's rinse and repeat. I'll wake up, I'll try to do my best at my job, and 5 minutes later I'll be told everything I did is completely wrong, that it must be redone, etc. I'll cry a bit, hate myself another bit, watch modern family while I have lunch, now I'm happy again, yay, but oops 5 minutes later my boss tells me I did something else wrong.

67,"Let's start this at the beginning, a long time ago in a galaxy exactly in the same place as our own, on a planet identical to our own there were some people. They were a group of people who had been brought together for a purpose. What was their purpose? They needed to solve a problem.

In this ancient time there were these giant entities called ""corporations"" and ""businesses"" that consisted of many intricate mechanisms and individual organisms that tried to perform those mechanisms as best they could. Some of them even spent a great deal of time and effort to create new mechanisms or to improve existing ones so that things could run more efficiently, thereby increasing rewards and lowering stress for every organism.

By this time most ""corporations"" or ""businesses"" consisted of teams of individuals who all worked together to help simplify things that were ridiculously complex by focusing on one specific aspect or one specific problem instead of having everyone just randomly trying to work on whatever they wanted which was, frankly, a mess. If you want to make money, if you want to go forward then you can't have messes. Messes hold you back.

Teams are great things but they do have one very serious flaw. That flaw is that people are only human, not all of them are perfect. Most people who worked within a team were happy to contribute as much as they could, they were dedicated to helping each and every one of their team get their work done fast and to discuss problems in order to solve them. Each person together can work to create greatness or to make everyone's live's easier. But then we have the problem. /sad trumpet noise

Some people are not team players, they do not want to work as part of a team, they care more about themselves and do not care for the feelings of others. These are the people who hold the entire team back, who make their team look bad, who nobody likes and nobody wants to work with. These are the people the MBTI system was designed to manipulate.

Yes, did you notice I used that word? Interesting. The Myers Briggs Type Indicator test is a personality test that people were told to fill out themselves and is designed to solve this team-player problem. Now many of you out there who exist above the level of the common ape can already tell why the system is flawed, or at least *one* of the major issues. But I digress. This test consisted of a series of questions, each one aimed at determining what ""type"" of person they were, what kind of personality traits they had.

Here is where we start to run into some issues. Throughout the whole test there really are no wrong answers or right answers, there are no bad results, only good results. It really doesn't matter what you answer because the end result is always the same. Here's where the human side of it comes into play. When asked to describe themselves most people will find it difficult and awkward, they will answer humbly and downplay any positive qualities and usually overstate the negatives but the people this test was designed for are very different. When you are this kind of person you tend to overstate and even invent good qualities and just completely ignore any negatives at all. When these people fill out the test they answer the questions as honestly as they can which is to say that they truly believe that they're being truthful and there's no shame in that, right? The thing is that what they are doing is projecting this idealised, fantasy version of themselves onto the test. Then they get results that tell them what a wonderful, what a very specifically-wonderful person they are and that they deserve a pat on the back. Then they feel good about themselves and since they think they're a good, kind, thoughtful and caring person they contribute to their team more and everyone hates them less. Oh, and the company profits also increase, just a coincidence, I'm sure.

Now let's get this straight. Any personality test that you fill out yourself is flawed, it is meaningless garbage by definition. This is where most people would just disregard the test entirely. The whole thing was designed to manipulate selfish, egocentric individuals into thinking they were empathetic, kind, generous or whatever kind of ""good"" people they deluded themselves that they were so that they would be less selfish and egocentric in the workplace and increase productivity for the company in general. The trouble is it turns out that using people's personal flaws in order to manipulate them into doing what you want is highly unethical and *that* is the reason it quickly fell out of favour.

The thing is that everyone wants to think that they are a good, nice person but most people are just people and people who *are* actually nice, clever or empathetic would never even think of doing a test like this other than for a joke. Why would they? Good, nice people who care about others are too busy being good, nice and caring people to even consider such a thing. The people who deliberately go out of their way to classify themselves through any online personality test are always selfish, egocentric people and they are often toxic on top of that because of course the two things usually go together, as we all know. There are plenty of people out there who you can meet in real life and thousands of historical examples of people who self-identify as ""empathetic"" or ""kind"" and ""caring"" people who in reality are arrogant, hateful, spiteful, twisted and frankly horrible people. Thinking you are a good person does not make you one in fact it almost guarantees that you *are not* one. This is just the way things work, people. How people work, things.

So yeah, if you go around telling people your ""type"" and acting like it makes you some kind of intellectual, lovely person who is incredibly in tune with who you are and that other people are clearly just mindless automatons like most MBTI fans do then you are literally advertising the fact that you are the polar opposite, you are the one everyone else hates because you're a selfish, egotistical arsehole.

68,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked  sad/mad about it so idk what to do. 

One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised (in an upbeat bubbly way) and asked me where the job was for (a  bar job) and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else on the other side of the city  instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",18Aug2020,1
69,"Okay guys I think things are starting to turn around for me, I actually got that forklift operator job a talked about in my last post here and I’m crazy exited and sorta terrified lol.

I was kinda losing hope on it because it seemed like they were dragging their feet on the phone interview, and they had to talk to the temp agency I went through last time (and I was younger and called out/ left early a lot more than I should have) but I guess it wasn’t to bad because I got my acceptance email yesterday and I go to take my drug test today, and I don’t do anything so I’m basically already in :) 

Stuff like this normally doesn’t work out for me, like ever. It almost doesn’t seem real but at the same time here I am :) sorry if I’m rambling I’m just crazy exited and I wanted to share this with whoever will read it.

70,"Back in April 2017, my youngest sister adopted a pet Syrian hamster. He was so cute and everyone fell in love with the little guy. In December of the same year, my other sister also decided to adopt a hamster too. She went for a tiny Russian white dwarf hamster. Unfortunately, she would bit you if you approached her, but nevertheless she was still adorable. I fed her seeds almost every day, and she also exercised frequently.

Sadly, on September 2018, the first hamster died of old age. My mom gave me the news at midnight, and she was actually in tears. I couldn't sleep well that night.

The next day, my dad had to hide the hamster's body in my grandpa's freezer, so that my sister wouldn't notice and she could focus on school. When she came back, we broke the news down to her, and she naturally broke down in tears. She cried herself to sleep that day. Later, the little guy was buried on a town where some family friends live. With a cross and everything.

A few months later, she adopted another Syrian hamster. This one had a white spot in its fur, and originally she thought it was female, but it was male. I mean, I loved it too, but it meant we had to go through the same heartbreaking process again, after some months.

Meanwhile, the Russian dwarf lasted a lot longer. She just recently passed away on June of this year. She's still in the freezer as we can't go over to the same town to bury her next to her old neighbor due to the pandemic.

Today, the second Syrian hamster has reached old age too, and I think this will be its last day in this life. As I'm writing this post, the poor little fella is in his cage asleep, most likely dying. My little sister must get ready to go through the heartbreak once again...

It's really heartbreaking that cute creatures like hamsters have to be so short lived. Many of you probably know the pain that is losing a pet, and how awful it feels.

So if I could make a wish, it would be to make hamsters and other pets live a little longer. Maybe as long as some species of parrots or so. Is it selfish to think this way? Maybe, but we humans are inherently selfish creatures, right? Have you ever wished your pets lived longer?

At least, the three hamsters lived a happy life with their owners, and I wonder if we could even see them again in the afterlife.

As teenagers, we're always on social media. Good things come with that because we have a feeling that we belong to a community. But it does bring you down whether you like it or not. For me, i will never stop comparing myself to other people's lives which forces me to be ungrateful for what i have. I want to rebuild myself and my mental health. So to start off on this journey i needed a strong mindset, with this comes a goal. Mine is, as a soon to be senior in HS is to focus on my studies in order to get a scholarship and study abroad. No one is gonna help me with this specific goal other than myself, therefore i have a goal and focus. Second, i'm cutting myself off of social media because it just feels so good. to not have to be on my phone all the time, seeing what others post on their boring stories like them eating or traveling etc, literally who the fuck gives an actual shit what you do lol. It's time for me to have responsibility on my mental health and actions and move forward on with life, i might be young but i will not force myself to live off of my phone 24/7 and see what people are up to and mostly i just don't want people to know what i am up to.

82,"I’ve always been a big supporter of people going to therapy, don’t get me wrong. I also know plenty of people who have had great experiences with their therapists / therapy in general. I haven’t been so lucky. 

I’ve seen three therapists so far and all three have been negative experiences or just overall disappointing. The first one just sat there and took notes and wouldn’t ever try to have conversations with me. I asked her if we could change that and she told me we weren’t going to be a good fit. The second one felt promising but after three sessions she called out of the blue and said that she didn’t think she could help me. 

This most recent therapist seemed promising at the start and promised I would have a positive experience with her after finding out about my other two. Except she keeps cancelling on me at the last minute on the days of my appointments with her. She also promises to email me worksheets / articles that we discuss in session but she never does, even if I remind her. Plus she will make plans for our next session and then not hold up her end of the plan.

83,"When you really want something you work hard and you do anything and everything in your power to ultimately reach your goals.

I recently applied to college again, though I don't actually have a plan. I'm really only going because I don't want to work five days a week busting my bones and only getting paid the bare minimum. I felt like applying to college was already some effort but now I have to apply to fafsa which my parents don't want to help me with, which means I have to find other loopholes. I don't actually want to though. I'm 21, I'm female. My boyfriend graduated when he was 23. 

I always planned that I was going to kill myself since a very young age because you know bullied and stupid shit at school and at home, and now that I've lived this long I have no plan. I smoked a bunch of weed in highschool and did a bunch of drugs when turned 18. So I'm not sure if there's something missing(assuming I have half a brain) which is why is hard for me to stay focused.

Focus is something I was never able to grasp. Always on the go, only entertained for a day or two then off to finding something new. Not sure how to find the path of life or if this is what it is. I feel like I was accomplishing something at least applying but applying is the easy part. I just feel like I'm wasting my time still trying to figure out what I want to do. I'm happy, but I know long term I don't want to be in the same position wishing I had the time. 

I'm looking for advice, I don't know what to do or how to start doing. And if someone else is feeling the same way, pm me and we can maybe look at ways we can help each other be a better self for ourselves and our future. as corny as it is",18Aug2020,1
85," Last week, I read in the news that Pinterest is facing charges related to gender and racial discrimination. Today morning, I woke up to a headline that read ""Pinterest announces first Black board member.""

This is so obvious. You can't use POC to undo bad reputation. Call me a cynic but I don't think most companies even believe in inclusivity. After all, isn't this why we are pushing for diversity? To welcome a spectrum of new ideas, opinions, perspectives, and whatnot. Stop pushing for diversity, and focus on finding the right talent.

I remember Tesla hiring a black HR VP and Head of Diversity. A year later, I find out the woman has been replaced and the one who replaced her left the job in three months. I mean, how fucking obvious is it that companies are now simply paying lip service to this idea of diversity and inclusion.

I live in a country were it's normal to kiss each other on the cheek or hug when saying hello, I always hated this so I'm glad it's gone.

87,"This was over 20 years ago but I’m still curious about it. I was on the shy side and not extremely popular with women in college, I had a few flings/relationships. Anyway there was this one girl “MK” who was very pretty and seemed very nice as well, and we seemed to notice each other since freshman year. We weren’t in the same social circles but occasionally would be at the same party or bar or would see each other on campus and say hello and chat a bit.  She really seemed like she liked me but I never made a move or asked to hang out or anything.  Once during junior year I knocked on her dorm door randomly while handing out flyers for something and she seemed very excited to see me, invited me in and we talked for like an hour. Still, I couldn’t manage to say anything better than that I hoped I see her at the party etc.

Fast forward to senior year. One night the stars seemed to align in my favor.  At a bar we both went to, I ran into her pretty late in the evening, the crowd had thinned and she was sitting at a table with just one of her friends. I sat down and we started talking for a good while.  Her friend left the table to give us a little alone time. I started testing the waters getting a little touchy-feely on her back and arms and finally we shared a quick but nice kiss and held hands.  I was really digging it.  As the bar was getting ready to close I asked her if she was hungry could I buy her a slice of pizza.  We went across the street to the restaurant for a slice and held hands when we were down eating. This was October and she asked me if I wanted to go pumpkin picking with her the next day which I think was Saturday.

So we did the pumpkin picking the next day, had a great time. She invited me back to her apartment to carve them. When we were done she made hot chocolate and we snuggled on her couch and snuck a few kisses. Her roommates were with us but when they left the room we kissed more passionately.  At some point we kissed goodbye and I left.  I was feeling really good about this relationship starting.

Now comes the puzzling part. After all this and build-up, it was over before it even started really.  The next day I called her and something must have changed. I invited her to hang out with me or something, and she told me she couldn’t, and she wanted to just be friends. I was in shock.  I tried not to be pathetic about it but I asked her what changed since yesterday, that I had liked her for a while and I thought we had a thing going. She said she needed to focus on her school work and graduating and couldn’t have a boyfriend.  I said thats fine we could take things slow/casual and she repeated that she wanted to be friends. I asked her so do mean platonic friends?  And there was a pause and she said yes.  I was dejected and told her that was going to be difficult for me, because we were just getting started as more than friends, and maybe she would think about it because I really liked her and I would be fine to take things slow/casual. She said she was sorry and I said ok I would talk to her sometime soon.

A few days later I called her apartment frankly to see if she’d changed her mind or was open to it.  I was not so much a loser to beg or anything but I really didn’t understand how she could change her mind overnight.  Her roommate who I knew here and there picked up the phone. She told me MK wasn’t there, but it was best if I didn’t call again. I was shocked, and upset but I kept my cool. I asked her if MK had told her to say that and she wouldn’t answer. I asked her if there was something that happened etc and that MK told me a few days ago that she wanted to be friends at the very least. She said that’s between you and MK I can’t get involved and I said you’re getting involved telling me not to call I just don’t get it. And said she was sorry and we ended the call. 

And that was pretty much that. I saw MK a few times the rest of the year and we said hello/goodbye politely/nervously. To this day I have absolutely no clue what happened. I was/am a good guy. There really were no skeletons in my closet or anyone to say anything bad about me. The only thing I can say is that I was very, very, very casually seeing another girl.  Not my girlfriend, zero commitment, had not slept together, just hooked up with a few times.  Could she have found out and thought I was being sneaky or something?  I actually really liked MK and would have gladly gone exclusive with her and never hooked up the other girl again.  Seems like a very strange reason to change your mind about someone and not to even discuss it.

Anyway I am just getting this off my chest, telling this story and open to any comments. I know I’ll never know for sure.",18Aug2020,1

92,"I guess I should explain that I'm freshly graduated and currently live with my parents. During my gap year, I wanted to learn how to 'adult' and thought it would be a good idea to move in with my brother during that time. He lives somewhat nearby, so it would be a smoother transition and not so hard on my parents. Not to mention, he is pretty low on cash, so it would be nice for him as well. My older brother also stayed at his pretty large house without paying room and board, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't taking advantage of him, so I worked it out that I would pay a certain amount and also take over some chores. Overall, it would benefit us both. 

I was really excited to move out because I felt a little stuck in my life, and I welcomed the much-needed change in my life. I thought that I could learn independence from my parents, and maybe be forced into making some new habits. My parents aren't bad parents, but I can feel suffocated by their constant presence in my life and their influence over every simple decision I make. Honestly, this was a big step for me and my excitement was sky-high. I was becoming a new person and this was my first jump into new-found confidence and freedom. I was so excited, I already started packing my things up. He said I could move in whenever, so I brought my books and other items over to my new room.

But last night, he popped over and quickly told me that he didn't want me to move in. He said that it was weird because I was a girl. I could almost see the burden being lifted off his chest. He left as soon as he said it. I never felt so betrayed and disappointed in my entire life. I understand it is his house and he can do whatever he likes with it, but it still hurts. The worst part is that I know that that is not the entire truth. I don't know why or what I did to make him feel so uncomfortable, but I know my gender is just one minor issue; because he and my other brother have complained a ton when my conservative parents felt unsure about them inviting their female friends overnight for long periods of time, so I don't see why it would be an issue now. We've had some fights in the past, but nothing too big. I know that my gender is not a major cause of his new decision, but now I'm left to wonder what is? What does he not feel comfortable about with me? Why couldn't he just be honest with me? If he is, why the double-standards? 

Again, I know I shouldn't feel entitled, it is his call to make. I just feel like the rug has been ripped out from under me and now I'm back to square one. I'm trying so hard not to feel disappointed, but I can't help it. He stopped by me today and asked me to stay at his house whenever he leaves somewhere, so I can take care of his dogs. I told him no thanks. He can have my little brothers take care of them like he usually does.

A good thing: My father heard the entire interaction, and despite not wanting me to move out, he was in tears later that night because he felt so bad for me. He felt so sick the day before because he didn't want me to leave, but now that I can't (I live in a very rural area and to move somewhere else would mean I would have to find a new job and living expenses would be so much more), he feels horrible for me. I really love that guy and was so touched (he NEVER cries), I nearly cried as well. He thinks that my brother doesn't want me to move in, because then he would have to change his sloppier lifestyle (his nice house is always trashed because he doesn't clean up after himself). But I think it would not only force him to change things, but it is also because he just doesn't feel comfortable around me. I guess I just feel like I thought we were closer than we really were.",18Aug2020,1

95,"I tried to kill myself 1 year ago today. Not one of my better ideas. 150 people kill themselves a day in america. over 3000 attempt to kill themselves. And that number is going to go up when the stimulus inevitably doesn't go out.

I'm not going to put the phone number. Truth is the number doesn't do shit most of the time. People post it to feel better, and sometimes it helps. But I can tell you when you're in the state of mind that leads to suicide talking to a stranger over a phone isn't going to do anything for you most of the time. And I've called the number, it didn't help. 

The thing that does something is intervention. Be attentive to your friends. If they don't seem well, you might need to go out of your way and risk being awkward to see what's going on. You may have to drag them to a hospital yourself against their will. I was suffering from schizophrenia at the time and no one knew. If they die (and you're a normal human) the pain you will experience will be terrible. The regret. So be proactive and be attentive to your friends. At the same time know you're not ultimately responsible for anyone but yourself. But try your best to be compassionate because a lot of people, like my self a year ago, are hurting so deeply and might not reach out. 

In my case, my friends didn't know what to do, so they did nothing. They told me to go see a therapist. I thought that I was the antichrist, I thought that I was jesus, I would go back and forth from the car trying to leave LA to my room to write music to my bed. My roommate and friend tried to help by taking me to a hospital where they gave me a shot. But that didn't work, so he gave up on me. He left razors and a bottle of alcohol out on the nightstand and told me I could use them if I wanted. I spent three days cutting myself lightly until I finally did it. He was making beats. I was bleeding out heavily when the landlord came and found me. 

If you're in a good mental state, or even a bad one, you're supposed to look out for other people. That means going out of your way. That means being awkward. Even if you're a heartless person, who can't feel, which I know some of you are, just do it for fun.

The state does not do that. Let me tell you, many nurses, doctors, and even social workers don't give a shit about their patients. After my landlord found me I went to a hospital and then the psych ward. They were nice at the hospital to some extent, but I wasn't communicating with what was going on so they sent me to the psych ward. 

The psych ward where I stayed was terrible. People egged me on to kill myself including staff. They saw I was suicidal and didn't send a one to one for hours. Workers would shine flashlights in my face at night so I couldn't sleep. The nurse would put tape on my arm in a way that purposefully hurt to tear off. Most of my one to one's didn't talk to me at all (a one to one is someone who is assigned to a suicidal person in a psych ward to keep them from harming themselves) (very thankful for the one's that did talk to me). I had a doctor that would ask me not how I was feeling but what I was thinking so she could prescribe me pills as quickly as possible. Most groups were either involved coloring in a coloring book and talking about what you wanted to do for a career, doing simple art exercises like ""trace your hand and draw what you can't control outside of your hand"". BITCH I CAN'T CONTROL SHIT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. 

I didn't improve at all until one part time employee took an interest in me and took time out of his day to help untangle my mind and heart. This isn't everyone's experience, but it was mine. Don't hand your loved ones and friends over to the unbelievable bankrupt medical system. My friends tried to visit me in the hospital but they couldn't find where I was sent to. 

Every 40 seconds someone kills themselves. 

If you're in a good mental space and can handle it, set a rec-curing timer for 40 seconds. Every time it goes off, someone else's baby, friend, lover has killed themselves, somewhere. 

If you're suicidal or even have those kinds of thoughts and want to talk, please DM me. I will call you and if you're in LA we can meet. I can tell you from experience that you will probably fail, and you will hurt a lot of people that care about you. Even if no one cares about you, Jesus cares about you (you can downvote me all you want for that) even if you don't believe it, and I care about you. If you try to kill yourself, you statistically won't be successful and the psych ward hell is not something you want to go through. 

The world is cold, America especially, full of people who have covered up their heart with drugs and games and humor until they can't feel anymore. People like my ""friend"" who gave me those razors. Forget those people. Cremate them, give them a burial, not yourself. The world is also full in equal measure of beautiful, wonderful people who want to help and feel your pain. Run. Run to your family, run to a pastor, run to a therapist, run to a random person on the street until you find a good person. 

If you're not suicidal and really want to get involved, ASPF is a good place to start.",18Aug2020,1

100,"Just to preface, these thoughts may not make any sense, but hopefully someone can relate or understand. 

Even within these thoughts, I'm sure I have some form of ""identity."" I was talking to my therapist this morning, telling her that the root of my suffering is a fear of others seeing who I am. When she asked what those things were, I told her I didn't have a solid answer. 

I hope what I'm about to say makes sense. I spend so much time feeling ""different"" than the people I'm around. I've never fit into a ""group"" of ""like-minded"" individuals. I don't have an aesthetic. I have likes, and people form a perception of me. That's the self that exists to other people, but it isn't ""real."" 

I find myself changing often with the people I'm around. I'll discuss religion with religious people as if I am too, if that's what they want to talk about. But I have no religion. I see possible truths and the abstract concepts from it, but I have no personal truths I identify with within religion or other philosophies. 

I feel like this idea of trying to curate my ""self"" has caused more distress than anything. I feel like I am nothing. I'm just here. 

I'm a relationship anarchist... But that makes me feel odd too. Because I prefer not to see relationships with labels. They are what they are. I have a dislike of constructs in general (I suppose I am identifying with something since I do have likes and dislikes). It's a dislike of rigidity. I hate limiting myself to a label or belief system. 

I have political ideologies but I'm never sure of them. I take on the idea that seems to be the most beneficial for humanity, but I feel uncomfortable subscribing to a party. I have a dislike for people that always view themselves as right. I feel like there's an objective truth of some sort, but the world and my limited perception makes it too complicated for me to take a solid stance across the board, even though I will when it feels necessary. 

I catch myself taking lately, and it's like I'm witnessing myself talking from the personality I've curated through my conditioning and experiences. I don't feel an attachment to it. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable mid conversation and I'm like ""what am I doing? What am I even going on about?"" I do it because it makes people uncomfortable to say ""I don't know"" about everything. I let the parts of myself that people want to see show. I don't feel like I am always lying. It just feels pointless to give my perspective, because I put such little stock into my own. 

I don't like a particular type of music more than another. I don't like the concept of gender or gendered things. I like changing what I like and think every day. I like endless possibilities. I like the expansiveness to just ""be."" I use to identify with my thoughts and try to shape an identity from that, but I realized I was constantly ""wrong"" or placing limitations on myself. 

Yet, I still think it would be nice sometimes to have a greater sense of ""self."" I'm always stuck in abstract thought about everything, and I don't feel like I really belong anywhere. I wished people could understand and see ""me"" but I don't know who that is. I'm constantly breaking down and questioning everything that I think, and I really don't feel content sitting anywhere for too long. The longer I'm on social media or the more I'm around people, the more I slip into the unconscious""blending."" 

I don't have symptoms of NPD or BPD or any of the personality disorders that are mentioned when I try to look up this sort of thing.",18Aug2020,1
101,"For context... I developed an eating disorder my senior year of high school that was diagnosed when I was 19. I was in treatment for a year and a half (outpatient therapy) and actively struggled with maintaining a healthy weight for about four years. I'm now 31 and have a significantly better relationship with food, my body, and anxiety and want to educate and encourage folks going through recovery!

note: numbers like weight lost, calories consumed, and time spent exercising can be very triggering for anyone going through an eating disorder. I will avoid discussing these and I will flag any posts that include these or appear to be pro-eating disorders. This is a place to be supportive and encouraging.",18Aug2020,1
102,"I am a 22 year old person who recently graduated from university succesfully. The time that I spent on university was almost great for me. I was always good looking, socailly very active and funny guy with high self esteem but not an ego person. Everyone around me liked me a lot. I had a beatiful relationship which lasted few years and ended few months ago. There were always someone (except my family) to meet face to face, chat about life, etc. After the graduating from university I moved to my parents house which is on different city and started working in a little company which doesn't include peer to me. The youngest person among them is around 40 years old. Of course I do love my parents very much and love spend time with them. But, I don't have anyone except them in here. After we got the distance and everyone graduated, our friend groups started to fall apart. I have no friends left to share anything with in my life both online or face to face. I had never been alone in my entire life and what I feared most was being alone. 

I feel like everything overlaps. I have no financial problems, but I feel morally broken. I became an introvert from being an extrovert person. Since I am completely unfamiliar with my environment, I cannot find places to socialize. University was a great opportunity for this, but I graduated and I'm working. I can spend time on my own, but I get tired of it immediately, I want to have other people around me and socialize. However, as I mentioned, I cannot find suitable environments for this. When I look at the meetup events in my neighborhood, there are no good events that might interest me. I'm thinking of enrolling in some of the courses in my neighborhood. My only hope is to find a person close to my age there. What else would you recommend?",18Aug2020,1
103,"I hated high school, I really did. However with my last year of high school ending so unexpectedly I guess I never got around to cleaning out my back back until today since I plan to use it for college. I look back and think about how miserable I was until I really went through my back pack. It’s hundreds of papers filled with dumb equations and useless assignments but all garnished with a bit of happiness. Corners with half finished games of tic tac toe, backs of papers being used to play hang man full of inside jokes, and margins full of little notes back and forth. Every single binder is also stuffed full on notes hidden away. Not the mean kind but the sweet kind asking each other if we were okay and making each other smile. Almost every paper has some sort of social interaction on it between my friend group. I will admit I did start 80% of these as I was always terribly bored but I also made so many wonderful memories in those moments of nothing. I can’t believe I’m saying it but I’m gonna miss high school. Not the classes, but all the friendships written in margins out of boredom.",18Aug2020,1
104,"So, hi. My name is Ehsan shabahang. I run a youtube channel, and I think I cant do it anymore. Let me explain. When I was a kid, I lost my dad them, my mom, and my sister, and then I got adopted and moved from Iran to the USA. While here I lost my grandparents and had no idea what I would do, I went back to Iran, and it was there that I got captured. Torture by the Iranian government because of my American citizenship and I was forced to join the military, so I ran away and crossed the border to Afghanistan; it was there that I went to our military based and asked for help.
Since I was a citizen, they did so much for me and helped me get back to the USA. But after I came here, I had no place and no one to go to. I was homeless for a bit, but I found a job at McDonald's and started working there; it was okay, and I was able to get a place. After two years, I joined our military and was deployed to Iraq for three years. It was terrific, but we got ambushed, and I got injured. They sent me back, and because of my injury, they told me that I have to retire from the military. I was so sad, so I thought I could join the police force and make a change there, so I did, and I joined the federal police department, but there I was always made fun of, and it was so bad because they were very racist to me. After a year, I quit and went back to school now I am working on my master's degree, and I am doing youtube on the side. I have always tried to be positive, but it is not working I can not work normal jobs because of my disability and I make this account just to advertise my youtube channel, but I never get anywhere I do my best, but I always fail, And it  backfires on me I am at an endpoint this is my first real message, but someone tells me why is nothing working for me my passion is to use what I learned and help someone, but it does not work, and I always struggle 😭😢😭 I am simply tired of trying",18Aug2020,1

The second I got into the interview I wanted to pull my hair out - well, the near second. He was arrogant, he was condescending and I could already tell he would be demanding. He told me he put me in the ""good pile"" and this was only the first interview and they'd have more. It's a job with little oversight and little direction, he only cares about results and that sounds good in theory, except  the vibe he was getting off was very.... this whole situation just didn't seem right to me and like it would be massive headache and I'm just so happy I can be in a position where I don't have to say yes to everything because I'm desperate.",18Aug2020,1

The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

I took the time off of work that I shouldn't of had to do to try to get emergency assistance after a trusted full grown man was creeping around with pictures of my kids in his phone that were taken without my knowledge, claiming to be romantically involved with me. If God forbid, I didn't follow my gut and something happened to my girls it would be ""WhErE wAs ThE mOm!?"" and ""oh she knew about it and did nothing, lock her up too! "".

124,"I remember how at the start of this year, just as the virus was turning into a pandemic, I was in a constant state of fear and panic when going to work.  I lived with my parents, who were both considered ""at risk,"" and I worked at a hotel restaurant, where any of the customers could be infected and you'd never know where they came from.  My workplace didn't start being more careful about the whole situation until we were forced to.  Wearing masks was optional and occupancy would have stayed the same if people weren't scared enough to stay home.  Coming to work would make my anxiety shoot through the roof and I kept thinking that nothing *I* did would save me or my family from a potential infection.  By the time we closed and all of us were temporarily furloughed, I was looking for any reason not to come to work.  I was literally scared.  When I came back to work, I felt less scared when I saw everyone was wearing masks, being more serious about cleaning, and limiting the amount of people in an area at once.  It made me worry only a third of the amount I used to and I actually felt comfortable at work again, but I can see the issues.

We don't get as many guests during the weekdays and are under-staffed for the major rushes during the weekends.  The hotel also won't let the employees get free food since they're trying to save money on costs, but also closed down the employee cafeteria because they served food in a buffet-style setting.  Then there's the mask situation.  Personally, I don't mind masks regardless of what anyone says.  They at least prove that people are willing to comply and be respectful and the smallest chances of protection are all I really need.  But it's a little different for my job since I work outside by a pool 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.  If you've never worn a mask outside when it was really hot, it's a pure sweaty nightmare.  Your breath gradually heats up your face, so combined with 100+ degree weather PLUS humidity, it's a problem.  My boss gave me and my co-workers permission to move it down when not around guests and other managers (his bosses) haven't had a problem with it.  They know how hot it gets outside where we work so it'd be cruel not to give us time to adjust.

And then this week, when it reached 107 degrees one day, we got chewed out by another manager for ""not wearing it properly.""  It didn't matter if we said how hot it was, how long we're working outside in this heat, or that the nearest guest was 20 feet away from us, we were supposed to wear a mask properly ""at ALL TIMES"" and then just left after making sure we put them up again.  (I'm still BOILING from that comment, but I really can't argue since she's ""right?"")  

Anyway, a few guests asked me yesterday if I was tired of all the restrictions and wished they'd stop.  Honestly, I thought about saying yes, but couldn't.  Yes, I could rant about the mask situation or the amount of guests we're getting (not as many as last summer), but in my mind, all I can think is how I haven't felt scared or unsafe in months.  I'm just...neutral.  They annoy me a lot and I find them frustrating, but I'd also hate to see them go unless I knew everything was fine again.   Also, they've kind of been a good thing in a way.

Like, I'm working near a pool this summer and in the past, I worked a full 8 hours outside, minus any moments I'd need to go inside.  I'm free to take my breaks whenever, but I have problems being assertive and can't do it unless someone insists I do.  But due to the restrictions, we're required to close the pool 3 times a day for an hour, meaning after I'm done cleaning, I can eat and relax for half an hour in an air-conditioned room.  Plus, not going to lie, it's really fun and satisfying as heck to use a Sanitizer pack.  I don't know the correct name, but it's one of those tanks you wear like a backpack to spray sanitizer.  I look like a Ghostbuster and even earned the nickname from my co-workers.  It also helps to hear so many people thank me and my co-workers for working so hard and for keeping them safe.  You'd expect people not to care or assume we're all doing it because we're required to, but so many do and it's really great.  Aside from the expectations of horrible heat, I'm often excited to come to work.  My parents also feel a lot safer because they don't have to worry as much about me bringing home the virus.

So I told them I'm numb to it.  As long as it makes me feel safe and calms me down, that's what's important.  Or maybe I've just gotten used to it?  Either way, I'm just happy I don't have to worry about how anxious I get over this.  I don't think clearly when I'm freaked out, so at least I can make smart decisions now rather than panic if I've doomed my family or not.",18Aug2020,1

Appart of this, I've been bullied by my classmates, even one of my professors made it too.

Oddly? As much as I hate them, I think I honestly prefer them. Could be maybe a self confidence thing. Not sure. But ever since then, I feel like I can be more open with people, downright and brutally honest, to some. 

Ever since, going outside without a mask, or to work without one makes me feel unready, and honestly, aggrevated that my coworkers don't wear them either. Not that I want them to assimilate to the way I am, rather, just for the health of others, including ourselves. 

I know it's a piece of fabric, and it sucks sometimes, especially in the heat and humidity, but, if it means I can do MY part for someone else? So be it. I wish more people shared this mindset.

She left to make some more.

I mean I understand her if she has to restart and do everything for one person it'd be great annoyance but in our household we treat our guests with out most respect.

Anyway, that's all. Just a friendly PSA to clean your toaster crumb tray out every once in a while!",18Aug2020,1
133,"I just sold something I made, something completely unique that I designed and then conjured ex nihilio. It was like $30, which is nothing, in the grand scheme of things. And it's not even the first piece I've sold. So it feels weird to even mention, let alone brag about.   


But I'm really happy nonetheless and I just needed to gush *somewhere.* I know it's the dream of a lot of people to be able to support themselves with their art and, while I'm not there yet, it feels good to put one foot in front of the other on the way to that goal.",18Aug2020,1
134,"work at a bar and one day I walked in to the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven’t talked to was sorting glasses and stopped and was staring at me smiling and then looked away to the glasses still smiling but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going to as I was going holding the plates and she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding and I was wearing a few shirts underneath a black buttoned shirt 👔 and my arm is stick skinny too so idk if she thought that) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery and she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right slightly while she looked at me as I was wrapping cutlery on the cabinet and said ‘you make me sweat, Graham’ and I said ‘what?’ then she come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking ‘wtf’ she then dropped her arms her face went sort of sad then walked off. The next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as s was putting her coat and scarf on she said ‘I haven’t got a boyfriend you know, Graham’ I was standing at the doorway on my phone and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud as he was on his phone and I looked at him then at her and she was looking back at me smiling after saying it and then looked away to carry on putting her scarf on in to her coat.

I’m 6ft tall and thin and lanky and she’s very pretty tbh",18Aug2020,1

136,"20 year old male.

Basically, how do I stop being craving for love and attention so much. In my mind I'm always telling myself that I'm not an attention seeker but more and more recently, I have realised I am. I've always found people who purposefully seek attention annoying but now I realise I'm no different and I wanna change.

For example, with friends in real life and online, I start getting jealous when they talk to someone else, especially if they are enjoying their company. I dunno why though, it's not like they belong to me but I feel like deep down, I think they should belong to me. Like, I might have not talked to this person for 1-2 weeks but then I see them talking to someone else, it makes me uncomfortable. 

On shit like Twitter and Instagram when I make a post, I get upset if no one interacts with my posts which is so dumb but I can't help feel this way. On my birthday, I'm always checking my social media to see if my friends have wished me a happy birthday and if they don't, i also get upset.

Final example, is that i always create these scenarios or stories in my mind where i do feel loved. Like having a girlfriend, or someone who is very close to me who understands me and someone I can talk to. Reading through this it just makes me sound like a little girl which is soo embarrassing.

I never seek attention from my family though, that's one thing. I don't why I'm like this though.",18Aug2020,1
137,"(This is my alt account, and trying to keep this fairly clean, so here goes it...)

One that really gets me even though it happened 9 months ago. I was being stupid and horny when I got a random friend request on FaceBook I accepted from what was obviously a fake profile, but I went down the rabbit hole anyways. I broke every rule of the internet just wanting to see some boobs and ended up FaceTiming this “girl” flashing my manly parts and going to my smiling face. 

Now the fun part, the next thing I see on the FaceTime is my own personal parts and face covering the screen. The scammer demanded my number and then was relentless in trying to get money out of me. I was as broke as a dog and even if I had the money wouldn’t give it anyways. I almost broke but collected myself and saved all the texts and reported it (although I most likely never will hear from the authorities).  The worst part is they posted it on Vimeo and it still hasn’t been taken down after 9 months. 

What have I learned from it? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I fell for the scam at a low point in life, it might even fuck up the career aspirations I have in life. The worst part is I’ll likely never get back at the person, and it’s also something I can never take back.

To those that read this far, thank you for reading, and guys, think with the head on your shoulders, not the one between your legs!",18Aug2020,1
