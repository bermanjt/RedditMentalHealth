5,"I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve had something like generalized anxiety disorder for years, but corona lockdown plus a number of other factors are magnifying the problem 100x. Today was terrible, the anxiety was all-consuming, and I essentially did NOTHING the whole day... on a work day. It was like my brain locked up and I became incapable of working or doing anything else useful. It finally occurred to me that this isn‚Äôt just normal stress. Something is wrong, and no amount of shameful feelings or wishing it away is going to fix it. 

Enough is enough. I called my insurance today, got referred to a therapist and reached out to them. It‚Äôs scary, and I hate the idea of burdening others with my problems. But you know what, I need help, so fuck it. There, I said it.

10,"Today was supposed to be an absolute great day. Possibly one of the greatest days of my life: finding out that I'm having a baby boy. Instead, I'm at a point where I just want to no longer be here. 

My story is a complicated one, one that will surely draw a lot of ire and criticism, and I really don't care to read it so i'm just going to keep this pretty short. My girlfriend left me for her what-was-soon-to-be-ex-husband, but still kind of keeps me in the loop. We talk, and I can tell she doesn't want to be with him. However, she doesn't have the strength to leave him. 

I keep thinking about all the dad things that i'm going to miss out on. The little things.. being able to rub her belly, being able to put up the nursery, etc. I've been to every appointment. I wasn't able to go in today due to COVID, but I was still there. Her husband won't help her, everyone already knows that. Even she does. But she doesn't leave. I can't get it out of my head that she would ultimately be better off without me, regardless of how that looks. But then I'm going to look like a deadbeat who doesn't want anything to do with my kid or the coward who ran away because he couldn't face his own problems, his own demons. 

Then on top of that, I had this absolutely great friend. Met her on here, actually. And now for other reasons I don't want to go in to, she's now gone. I feel absolutely all alone in this world. I'm continually trying to determine the point of everything. The point of living. I'm not religious, so I don't believe in any afterlife. I know I should say that I have my kid to live for, but even that doesn't feel completely real. It probably will when he's born, but I've got to make it that far first. 

There are two reasons why i'm still here.. and those reasons are fading pretty fast with my current state of mind. The mother of my child - she would feel so incredibly guilty and I wouldn't want anything to happen to her or the baby. the other reason is my mother. 

I know I need to get help. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow, but even then I have no idea what to expect. I've never been to one. I'd never been to a psychiatrist before this month. Turned out that was a good idea. Maybe therapy will too. I just don't know what to expect and that's giving me quite a bit of anxiety at the moment. 

I really hope I'm able to turn things around. I'm spiraling in a really big way right now and I don't know how to stop it.",30Apr2020,1

19," Let me start this office is going to be a really long post and maybe this can show you guys to not think that living in the hood or selling drugs or buying drugs is cool it really is never going to turn out good for you. I lived a good majority of my life in Pennsylvania I was born in New Jersey I dont really remember much from living in Jersey i'm 16 right now and this is just a throwaway account. to start off I lived a good majority of my life in a town called Wilkes-Barre wilkes-Barre is known for being a pretty tough place has lots of shootings lots of drug deals and all that s\*\*\* I lived there when I was about 9 years old to about 14 and then after that I moved to to a little nicer of a town the town was nicer but it was still pretty rough there still shootings there still drug deals but it was a fairly big leap from what Wilkes-Barre but I guess I can start off some of the stories in Wilkes-Barre that's where it all started but actually right before Wilkes-Barre i'll start there both my parents were drug addicts for a lot of my life and even into the years of me living in Wilkes-Barre two right before Wilkes-Barre living with one of my mom's good friends that took me in for maybe about a year a little less until they could get out of rehab and like most of people living in the hood neither of my parents had much money cuz they're right out of rehab so we had to move to a really bad neighborhood which was Wilkes-Barre in the moment I always hated living with all my brothers and my sister and all the people in the house but always fight and we always argue but now looking back at it I trade it for anything I miss being very close with my family right now I just live with my parents and all my siblings are moved out, a few things, small things that my brother was jumped I got punched in the back of your head by this kid I don't really know I used to be lots of I remember there used to be lots of guys would drive around and ask if you needed rides or some shit but we were smart kids so we never took them lmao. One big moment though that i remember is when our close family friend got shot buying blunt wraps at a corner store and like 12 at night. And im not saying its fault but when you live in a bad area you know not to be out when the street lights out if you can. But he got shot, and my brother like (17) at the time thought he was taking long so he went walking to meet up with him and ym brother heard him get shot and helped him get back to the house. He got shot cause this dude wanted his money and he only had some quarters and the pack of swishers on him. And i remember i was playing in the living room on my old xbox, and my brother busts through the door screaming to call 911 and im asking him if its a joke i thought he was fuc\*\*\*\* with me. Thankfully he lived but hes got so much in bills that he'll never pay them off and hes always in pain cause hes got metal plates and shards of the bullet still in him. Actuality going back a bit my family used to live with the friend that got shot with him and his mom, And he had a really good friend steve that was also a friend of the family(all my brothers and the familys friends are like 16-19 in these storys) and his close friend acctually got shot and killed in a botched drug deal on the same street of the house we lived in after wilkesbarre. The report said that the 2 shooters killed steve, wounded his brother and killed the other 2 in the house and that all the bodys had multiple shots in them making sure they were dead. And the 2 shooters said later that they didnt have any remorse so that hurt. I didnt know lets call him steve very well but i did remember him. And i remember talking to my dad(my brothers friend always came over to my parents house for advice and shit) and my dad said that the day he died he came over and was telling my dad that he was real nervous cause he was about to do a drug deal and the people were really shady, my dad told him to just stay home,He went and got shot and killed. Another one of my brothers friends was always fucked up in the head. And i didnt know him to well either, but i remember him. And he killed himself, my brothers told me he was in a car accident cause they didnt want me knowing that he killed himself but i later found out he killed himself. And its real sad cause i see him as a recommended friend on facebook every so often, and his last 4 posts were fucking heart wrenching. His like 4th to last post was a picture of him getting accepted into one of his dream colleges, and he was posting how his life is getting so much better and how hes so happy. Then his last post he said ""i did the best i could"" and thats the last thing he ever fucking posted. I once heard a quote that said sometinhg like ""you die twice,once when you take your last breath and the second time you die is when someone speaks your name for the last time"" and thats the reason i still try to think about these people even if i didnt know them that well i want to make sure that there not forgotten about. And on a fairly lighter note ill give some storys that i find funny now,maybe they werent funny in the moment but i can laugh at them now. And old friend of my mom from when we lived in jersey needed a place to stay so she stayed with us. But one of the days her and her husband stole like 200 dollars and a bunch of my brothers weed. And my brothers found out so my 2 brothers waited for them to come home then they put them to knife and hammerpoint and told them to give back the money and weed, and apparently (my brother told me this) my other brother had the hammer and he husband overpowered him and then had him at hammer point. Long story short they kept saying they didnt have it and my brothers just gave up. like the next day in the news one of the cornerstores down the street there was an arrest of 2 people and that had a lot of money on them and weed kept in tinfoil, thats how my brother kept his weed so turns out they did steal it. Theres another time that the moment itself wasnt funny but one day my brother found some pills in my moms jacket and flipped out (hes still got a lot of anger for the things hes been put through but hes really close with out parents now) and when he found them he flipped out and grabbed a hammer and smashed our kitchen table like 9 times. We went on using that table until a few months ago when we bought a new one. The funny thing is that we always had a cover on the table so you had to be carefull putting drinks on the table on a certain side cause they would fall in and spill everywhere. Theres another time from like 2 years ago when me and like 2 of my friends were walking to a 3rd freinds house, way to late at like 11 it was pitch black. And they were dumbass friends who would like yell random shit at people then run, and this time they did it and we noticed this guy was following us, so we ran and went in back streets to get to our friends house and we sat on the porch for like 15 minutes thinking he was gone and he came walking down and he was obvouisly high off some drugs and he came up mumbling and grabbed my friend and told my other friend to hold his jacket and looked like he was gonna punch him, so i went inside and was yelling to call the police (in hindsight i should of just clocked him he was already high he prolly would of went down easy but to be hnest i kinda babied out) but nothing escalated my friends parents and brothers came and called the police then we went inside and locked the door, some of them wanted to go outside and fight him but some poeple in the house were just saying to stay in he might have a knife which was the smart move. Long story short police came and arrested him after like 7 minutes of him slamming on the front door screaming for us to let him in. And thats about all the storys i could think of now prolly a few more but thats all thats off the top of my head for now. To be honest i wanted to vent but i also really want people to realize that being a gangbanger and living in the hood shouldnt be glorified its really fucking up and you aint gonna live long. And with all the rich little kids claiming there gangster and from the hood trying to use that slang and lingo thinking there cool, just stay in your private school with that great future ahead of you, hood kids might make fun of you for being rich but we all want it so bad, You dont want to live off of foodstamps getting your internet shut off, having people in your life killed robbed and jumped.

20,"Living in the United States has its positives, and its negatives. For those of you who do not and never have lived here, it's not as great as it sounds. Many people here are actually really negative and derogatory. Most people here do not smile, not do they have a good tone of voice when they talk to others. And I just don't know why a country that's supposed to be based off of acceptance for all has so many asshats. Seriously. Most people here, from my experience, are by far the rudest, most unfriendly, most unhappy, most stressed out, least relaxed people I have ever met. It makes me sad and I even cry about it a lot. I remember I asked one guy if he had any fun plans for Father's Day, and rather than be polite, in a horrible tone, he went: ""DOES IT MATTER?"" Jesus Motherfucking Christ people.

24,"Imagine someone offered you $1200, and to get that you give that person $500 and sign two papers. There's no catch, and it's a real offer. What kind of person doesn't take an offer like that? 

I'm a 19 year old college student who was claimed as a dependent, and therefore get no stimulus check. Big whoop. I tried, however, to explain to my mother who claimed me on her taxes that by both of us refiling and A. unclaiming me, and B. listing myself as ineligible to be claimed, I would receive a check. All we would have to do is repay the IRS $500 that she received for claiming me, and that's it. Refiling through our tax software is free, and it wouldn't have any other repercussions. There is no reason to not go through that process and come out on the other side with $700 that we wouldn't have had otherwise.  Besides, I live on my own, work and pay for everything myself, and pay for my own college, so I don't even qualify to be a dependent.

I tried to explain this and got absolutely fucking BERATED by that side of the family, calling me immoral for putting ""that kind of stress on my mother"", selfish for wanting more money, and rude, ungrateful, and undeserving of any more money from my family because I'm not satisfied. My mother's completely agreeing with them until I drop that my plan was to give the rest of the money that I would have gotten to her, so that we could pay off hospital bills. My dad was in the hospital for a week, has Parkinson's, and we have plenty of bills to pay. Suddenly the tone changed, she got quiet, and my aunt continued laying into me about how horrible I am for wanting that extra $700.

Then on the way out, my aunt drops that she can't wait until she gets her check, because she's so excited to go spend it on stuff for herself. Nothing before has gotten me so fuming. Money is an amazing concern for my family. Hospital bills pile up, insurance, property tax, layoffs get to us all, meanwhile my piece of shit aunt who makes over $100k a year and doesn't even fucking work has the audacity to tell me that money doesn't mean everything. My problem is that ""I'm not faithful enough, and that it's hurting the rest of my family"". 

My grandmother got out of the hospital for the second time just 4 days ago, and this same fucking has tried to give her tomatoes and pineapple because it ""heals the stomach"". SHE HAS AN ACTIVE FUCKING ULCER AND GASTRITIS, BUT YEAH LET ME GIVE HER THIS HIGHLY ACIDIC FRUIT BECAUSE A FRIEND OF A FRIEND HAD GASTRITIS AND CLAIMED IT HELPED. These kind of people make my blood fucking b o i l. It's not possible to correct them, because I'm ""young and not that smart for a college student"". No one wants to defend me because I'm young, but it's not me being hurt here. People seem to think I argue with them because I have a problem with authority, no I argue because I'm correct.

25,"I had a traumatic childhood and teen years, had depression and anxiety since age 6, grew up on my own with very few friends and always feeling lonely and left out. Developed at least four diagnosed mental illnesses, don't even know if there are any more. In my teen years I didn't think I'd survive past 19. I would cross the road without looking to see if there was a car coming when I was in highschool. I almost attempted suicide twice in my early twenties. Life made no sense, I didn't have any drive or any hope for the future, and I was sure I would just end up killing myself at one point.

I'm 26 now. I'm living with my fianc√©. We have a cat. We made pizza today. Quarantine has been fun with him. He understands that I'm mentally ill and need his help and support a lot, and he gives me all that with no complaints. He makes me feel loved and cared for. I love him and I'm looking forward to spending every new day with him. I'm getting excited about the plans we make for our future together. I spent my evening painting Van Gogh's Starry Night in my sketchbook. I found a book I've been looking for for years and bought it and I'm waiting for the order to be delivered. My antidepressants didn't make me feel nauseous today. 

Sometimes time and treatment don't make you not mentally ill. Some problems can be treated while some can't. Plus, there is always outside stressors in life that if you're prone, will kick you right in the shin when you feel like you've improved so much. However, despite having chronic mental illnesses that probably won't fully heal, having a lot of self esteem issues still and being extremely confused about what I want to do next in my career - I wake up every day knowing it'll all work out somehow. I'm happy despite the baddies.

27," First of all to start off with, I‚Äôm not claiming I have OCD, and I don‚Äôt want to self-diagnose but me and some people I know have brought up the fact I might OCD and I‚Äôve seen texts between my parents thinking I have ADHD. I‚Äôve researched OCD and ADHD and I feel like I have a lot of OCD ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù. 

 Some things I do is that I have to do things an even number amount of times, or else I go a little insane in my head. Like, if I don‚Äôt turn the doorknob twice, or even four-six times I get really uneasy. Also, whenever I enter a room, I always feel the need to touch all the corners in the room whether it be a table, or the corners of a tv, sometimes I feel the need to do it twice. At school I feel like I need to touch the corners of my desk and iPad but not the walls. Another thing I do is touch my face a lot. Like when I was in the 3rd or 4th grade I kept touching my eyebrows (even number amount of time) and my mom thought I had eye problems, so I went to the eye doctor but I was fine, I just didn‚Äôt know how to express how I was feeling. Also, this one is hard to explain but I always have to do things on the left. I‚Äôm right handed, but like if I‚Äôm walking and sit down I have to make sure the last step I take is with my left foot or it makes me really upset. This one is a little gross, but every time I use a makeup wipe I feel like I can‚Äôt throw it away so I keep used makeup wipes in my makeup bag even tho I won‚Äôt use them again. There‚Äôs a lot more, but it would take a long time to explain. 

I feel weird reaching out on Reddit, and I hope I don‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôm doing this for attention (which is why I‚Äôm scared to reach out to my dad or anyone). But I feel like it‚Äôs getting more and more annoying to deal with and I was wondering if this is something to worry about, or if these are normal behaviors. 

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm expecting out of this, if anyone knows a lot about OCD or if there‚Äôs something else that might be wrong, please tell me because these things keep making me upset and getting into my day to day life. Sorry for making this so long.",30Apr2020,1
28,"Okay, this might be an odd one, but let me explain. 

I often use social media as a tool to debate with people on political issues. I don‚Äôt want to argue for the sake of ‚Äúwinning.‚Äù I just genuinely want to provide insight/information to people and stand up for what I feel is right. Honestly, I feel a duty to do it. I understand it is a privilege to be able to openly discuss politics, and I am a privileged individual in many ways. Walking away makes me think that I‚Äôm an uncaring person who is abusing her privilege. 

But these debates are very emotionally taxing. While my responses are rational, on the other side of the screen, I am often filled with anxiety and anger. But again, my mind argues ‚Äúyou think arguing on Facebook is taxing? Think of the people you are defending.‚Äù It also takes up so much actual time. Combined with so many nonsense and biased news stories and fluff pieces... I hate social media. It makes me feel awful. I want to leave. And not just for a week. For good.

But I still feel like an asshole if I walk away and don‚Äôt actively try to make the world a better place by engaging with people on social media. So, would it be selfish to leave? To stop debating with people online? Would it be abusing my privilege?",30Apr2020,1
29,"TL;DR: I finally understand how the biologic molecules work together to form the basics of life. 

In high school I absolutely sucked at Biology. It was fast-paced, loaded with information, and honestly probably required some self motivation. At the time, I was too preoccupied in marching/symphonic band, Algebra II, and getting boys to like me (an unfortunately difficult task...). 

But now I‚Äôm pursuing my passion of animals and have aspired to be a veterinary technologist. Obviously biology is a *big* part of this field. And there‚Äôs an exam I need to take in order to take any classes related to vet tech stuff. I got a book to study the exam. I decided to start with the biology section. 

The biologic molecules section of the biology chapter is five paragraphs long. It wasn‚Äôt enough for me. I didn‚Äôt feel like I fully understood it. It wasn‚Äôt clicking. So I found some supplemental videos on YouTube, watched them 2-4 times each, took notes on them, then summarized it in my own words. 

My epiphany seems so silly now, but I‚Äôm glad I understand. Carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids all work together to form the basics of life. Each group is composed of smaller and smaller groups down to the carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms that form the smallest monomers. 

I‚Äôm not sure why this took so long for me to realize. Maybe my teacher was bad at explaining. Maybe it was presented in a learning style that doesn‚Äôt jive with me. Maybe I didn‚Äôt try hard enough. Who knows! The important thing is I understand it now!!

37,"My husband is a plumber. He‚Äôs gone to work pretty much every week day except Christmas since he was in his early twenties.  

We‚Äôre in our 70s now and this quarantine period has been absolute hell on him psychologically. Not only because he‚Äôs used to an active life of visits from the grandkids and going to work, but because he‚Äôs been forced to watch those worlds continue on without him. He started to think that while people definitely liked him, maybe no one really needed him. 

I did my best to assuage him of this ridiculous notion, but quarantine has been pretty trying on me as well, and I‚Äôm afraid I wasn‚Äôt as helpful as I could have been. 

But then some guys at his work, young guys who are healthy enough to still go in for emergency jobs, had a genius idea. I don‚Äôt know where they got it, but man oh man, it was a genius idea. 

They‚Äôve started FaceTiming him on the occasional job. They make a big deal of saying to the client ‚ÄúThis is a complex problem, we need to bring in someone more experienced.‚Äù Then showing my husband the problems with the camera and video the guys taking his direction as he suggests how to fix it.

They‚Äòre all extremely competent and experienced guys, and I think both my husband and I know they could handle all the things they call him about themselves, but those calls make his day. They help him feel as though he‚Äôs still a part of the world. 

The difference in him just before and just after getting one of these ‚Äúconsult‚Äù calls is profound. I can‚Äôt count how many times he‚Äòs now said ‚ÄúGuess they weren‚Äôt ready to put me out to pasture quite yet.‚Äù He‚Äôs trying to be lighthearted, but you can tell by the way he says it that he‚Äôs truly touched and relieved. 

I haven‚Äôt thought of the right way to thank those guys once this is all over. But I want to thank everyone out there doing things like they‚Äôre doing. Calling my husband and making him feel a part of the decision making and problem solving at work might genuinely be the only thing keeping him sane right now. 

Everyone out there making a point to get in an extra phone call, dropping off food, any small thing, could actually be the biggest event in that person‚Äôs life right now. If you‚Äôve been meaning to do one of those things and haven‚Äôt gotten around to it, it‚Äôs not too late.

I can't even really think of a rational explanation as to why I was mad, but I would fight with her and I said a ton of hurtful things that I regret deeply. One such incident happened when she hadn't responded to my message for 6 hours. I took it as an extreme personal attack and accused her of ignoring me and not caring about me, and told her that we should just stop being friends. When she told me she was busy one time, I accused her of lying. I felt like I constantly wanted her attention all the time and I would just get super angry and upset when I felt like I wasn't getting attention. I lashed out a lot, I broke promises, and I failed to be a supportive friend.

I feel like an absolute shitty and terrible person. I am a monster. She never tried to fight with me. She never said anything bad to me or about me. She was a sweet person. She didn't deserve even a fraction of what I did. I seriously miss her and I never realized what I truly had with her. I'll admit I had an unhealthy obsession with her, constantly wanting her to talk to me and wanting her attention, so maybe it's for the best.

Since we stopped talking, I've been committed to quitting alcohol and seeing my therapist more often. I joined AA and have a sponsor. It's not like it fixes anything I did in the past. But I like to think that without alcohol in my life, I'll have more chances to improve myself and cultivate healthier relationships with people. I truly want to be a better person and to support those that I care about. However, I think it's best that I do some self improvement before searching for someone else. I do hope that the universe gives me another chance to meet someone that I connect with, and I hope that I get another chance to treat them right.",30Apr2020,1

I have, but I still felt misunderstood or devalued by them. I was finally starting to make friends I got along with better, and then covid happened. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I've fallen down a well. I just want this all to be over. I don't want to be stuck in quarantine, but I also don't want to go back to college. I just wish I could be done.

40,"A few days ago my partner \[F\] told me \[M\] she was no longer interested in continuing our relationship because ""our life trajectories are different."" 

I agree with her. We are incredibly different people, at different stages of education, have different ideas about where our careers will be in four more years.

The thing that I can't get over though is that the day before she talked to me about this feeling, she was talking to me about where we were going to live, what kind of a family we might start, what our wedding might look like.

I would be a liar if I said I never considered ending the relationship, but over the past three months,  I had committed myself to the idea of being with her for a life-time, and building something together, and today I feel completely lost. 

We were planning a trip to the UK when travel restrictions were lifted, and I was planning on asking her to marry me. I am glad in some ways this has happened now, because I would be heart broken if my engagement proposal was rejected, or if I had ended up in a doomed marriage... but I feel so inadequate now, like over night she decided that I was not good enough. It is clear she doesn't completely know what she wants either.

I know I will feel better in a few months, this is not my first big break. I will move out and figure out my life again. Maybe I will move back east... But right now, I feel broken, incomplete, and I am left wondering if there was anything I could have done to be a better partner, or if the relationship was destined to end...",30Apr2020,1

I have a fairly rewarding job in environmental consulting, but I‚Äôm lost without field work and nothing I do seems meaningful when Trump is letting industry ignore environmental regulations right now. At the same time, my company‚Äôs response to this crisis was irresponsibly delayed, and there‚Äôs a push from upper management to still stay highly chargeable throughout this. There were layoffs in April, which we had last year around the same time (early/mid March), and lots of great coworkers have been quitting since August 2019 due to changes within the company.

49,"I feel very comfortable speaking about bad things that have happened to be. Talking about it is the only way to understand it, but people often call me intense or dramatic. the problem is that nobody wants to talk about their trauma. I don‚Äôt really understand why. 

My first memory is being 8 years old and my dad cheating on my mom then giving up custody. I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to begin with the rest. We nearly went bankrupt, my mom married the first guy she dated just Bc he offered to pay our bills. He was an alcoholic abusive asshole for years. I literally have a sleeping disorder because my stepdad would yell until 4am most nights in HS. I could go on and on. I was raped by the star athlete at my school one month before high school graduation, and almost raped again my freshman year of college if I had not physically shoved this man off the top bunk out of panic rage. I ended up transferring colleges four times due to trauma only to end up dropping out, working my ass off and eventually enrolling again online while working full time and supporting myself Bc my parents are too toxic to be around. 

There is an absurd amount of things I‚Äôve left out including eating disorder, drug addiction, trouble with the law. I used to feel like a fuck up who was destined with bad luck. But I refuse to feel about this stuff anymore. Why the fuck should we????? 

People get uncomfortable when we talk about it. That‚Äôs not our fault. 

The conversations that I‚Äôve had about my trauma are the only reason I‚Äôm a functioning adult now. If you don‚Äôt talk about it out loud, you will never understand it. 

Telling my parents I was raped was the hardest thing I have ever done. It took me 3 1/2 years. For the longest time I felt like why should I? I thought I was doing them a favor by protecting them from a horrible conversation. I was wrong. I was forcing myself to live with a horrible secret that I had no reason to be ashamed of. 

After that day I promised myself I would never feel ashamed of the hard parts of my life ever again.

If you go through something traumatic, you will change. If you need to take some time to mourn the person that you were before, then do that. It‚Äôs a part of the process. But unless you accept your trauma as a part of you, you will not grow from it and it will continue to consume you like a parasite.

54,"Not gonna lie I have been wanting to write about this for a little while just didn‚Äôt know the platform for it. I‚Äôm 20, and I do a lot of stuff that people my age don‚Äôt normally do. I‚Äôm damn proud of myself sometimes. I do WAY too much in my life honestly, my parents tell me this quarantine should make me realize I need to only have 1 job instead of 4 lol. I think I have done it pretty well.

4 jobs, yeah. I LOVE sports and really everything I do is centered around that. My biggest source of income, and my favorite job, is I coach a travel baseball team in the Summer. I‚Äôm already in my 3rd year as a head coach and I‚Äôm coaching 14 year olds. It is by far the best thing to ever happen to me, it‚Äôs something I want to do for the rest of my life and I highly recommend it to anyone that loves baseball that is out of the sport. It‚Äôs kind of hard to get into, I was super fortunate with the opportunities I have had. I should mention I am with my third organization in 3 years as well, story for another day lol.

I also am a field manager at a nearby sports complex. It‚Äôs easy, I am around baseball, and they are really flexible and let me work when I am not with my team. It pays $12 an hour and its not a job I dread going to. Another job that I recommend to anyone who loves sports, you deal with a dick parent every so often but who cares it‚Äôs a good story to tell your friends.

My most time consuming job is I am the PA announcer at a high school. I announce volleyball, soccer, basketball, baseball, softball, and track. It is something I have created many memories doing and I am super fortunate to have gotten the opportunity doing it. It‚Äôs a talent I have always had and don‚Äôt want to pursue honestly. Everyone has always told me I‚Äôll end up being a news anchor, announcer, something along those lines but it‚Äôs just not something I wanna do professionally so I just do this.

My most unorthodox job is I am a sports gambler. I know some will say it‚Äôs not a real job, but if I took all of my income I have gotten since I started 2 years ago, it is probably the biggest income I have had within any of my jobs. Before sports were shut down, I was on absolute fire and figured out doing research actually works. I would spend about 2 hours a night doing research for the next day and luckily I hit some pretty big bets the day before all of my sports got shut down. I had over $1500 to take out to hopefully keep my afloat comfortably until everything is back to normal.

And on top of all of that, I am a student studying to be a Human Resources Director. My mom and dad always have told me I need to find a job I will be happy with, and my uncle has always been persistent to tell me that money isn‚Äôt everything but it definitely makes everything easier. 2 things I will live by for forever.

Honestly it doesn‚Äôt ever feel like I‚Äôm swamped with time either. Doing all I do still allows me to play Call of Duty at a low-professional level at night, and find a lot of time to hang out with friends whether it be after a baseball game or on rare evenings I don‚Äôt have anything scheduled. Quarantine sucks but I understand more than most that this is needed. I‚Äôm a huge hypochondriac and won‚Äôt take any chances. I just want my life back!!!",30Apr2020,1

59,"I'm currently a dental student but I have periods of doubt that plague my mind as to whether or not this is the right profession for me. The biggest reason would have to be a lifelong dream of becoming a doctor (yes, i'm one of those people).

In saying that, I don't think that the reasons that I have for wanting medicine are valid reasons. If I'm being honest, it is entirely to do with my ego (cue the downvotes), so because of this, would medicine be something worth pursuing or am I wasting my time.

Let me elaborate on the ego part:

1) I hate being called stupid or it being implied that I am dumb in some way, I guess getting into medicine is a sort of justice/revenge on all the people who did say that to me.

2) My medical student/doctor friends always talk about how dentistry is where the med rejects go. 

3) In reference to point two, I don't see this as being too far off. Everyone I've asked in my dental cohort wanted medicine first, and decided upon dentistry after being rejected from med school.

4) My own mother told me that dentistry will always be second to medicine.

Although they shouldn't, all of these reasons really bother me. And to a lot of people it sounds petty, i'm sure, but I can't help but feel chained to these shackles. 

So help a girl out and please offer some opinions or advice. Thanks :)",30Apr2020,1
60,"          My new self learning journey started when I wanted a desktop pc. I didn't realize how little I knew, how much money I was ACTUALLY wasting as a kid. I was a loner (still am cause people are anoying, but that's for maybe another post) back in middle - highschool and I wanted nothing more than to just fit in. Wasted money on cool new things, shared stuff, always wanted the biggest and the best. It never worked out, kept spending and spending and still was alone all the way into college. 

           Throughout that time I was playing a mobile game and spent over 1 GRAND on that game buying stuff I shouldn't have. Looking at their ""amazing"" cheaper than ever extra VALUE bundles and they are the price of a triple A tittle game, it disgusts me. I basically had this mindset of ""I'll have the money for it soon with my next pay check so I should buy it now!"" Spending money I didn't have. Im glad I kicked this mindset before I got myself to take out loans and pile up huge debt when I really didn't need too.

         I then wanted the best and the latest phone, but I also wanted something different, my family are avid Apple users and everyone else that I knew who didn't use apple used a Samsung, so I got biggest and best pixel at the time when i really didn't need it. All I ever used it for was for calling my mom and dad (No friends), listen to music, watch some YouTube, Netflix, and then some other minor things, I played my games on an overpriced iPad that I also bought and got addicted to. Absolutely none of that warrants a flagship highest end phone at all. I only wanted it for ""expensive phone"" status which netted me exactly a BIG 0 friends. 

        Then I wanted a PC, yes guys, I bet you can guess what I wanted to do. I was going to blindly spend all my savings on the biggest baddest sickest PC cause if I can't get real life friends, I could impress people online and maybe then people will think I'm cool, or something dumb like that. So I have a cousin who built his own PC, I asked him for all the parts and I ordered them right away. Mind you, I didn't know anything much about PCs aside from the fact that you could build them yourself and some other surface level stuff. So too me, my cousin had the biggest, baddest, sickest PC. But when I started watching how to build PC tutorials on YouTube, I spread out into understanding the components, their spec to price value, etc etc. And soon I was cancelling and returning all of the stuff I ordered.

      I was doing it all wrong,  I realize, if I could build a an extreme kick ass computer for $2k, $1k, or even $750, why do phones now a days cost almost just as much for a fraction of a computers capability. Yes I understand that there's more money involved in making it smaller bla bla bla. What I'm saying is, I'm getting diminishing returns on phones after $500-$600. After this I began cutting back on my spending, understanding what I did have money for what I did not, what I should buy and what I shouldn't even if I really really wanted it. Money FINALLY started piling up ever so slowly after cutting back on subscriptions and pointless spending.

      I gave up on making friends after realizing that dealing with people is more of a hassle than it's worth and focus on learning Actualy valuable knowledge, because if I didnt know all this back then, what do I not know now that will benefit me even more. I was in this shell, this environment that made me think I knew everything and I won't need anything else, nothing more outside of spending all my money on a passing fad with the ""cool kids"".",30Apr2020,1

92,"I'm 38 - great career, healthy, well traveled (and always looking for more). I've been dating a guy about 2 1/2 years and we've started to discuss moving in. The problem is... I'm suddenly realizing now that everything is laid out perfectly for this LTR that I may not want any LTR at all. I've had several prior relationships get close - but they always implode before we hit this point. Not so easy this time.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought it was just about not wanting to tie myself to one city because I've always had ambitions for global public service (my BF has a thriving practice here - moving would mean a reset for him). But then I realized that at the point I've gotten my career to (I can go remote), I also want to do things like take work home and spend a couple weeks with my parents, or maybe go work from a national park for a month or two, or maybe work from Paris for a few weeks. What I don't want is someone calling to get back home after being gone a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

I also know that I have career options that could mean multiple moves to global cities. Options I would love to take if they come.

&amp;#x200B;

The BF is very settled - spends more on housing and nice furniture than I do (I prefer to spend on travel). Does not love it when I travel a lot for work. He's super successful and rooted in our city for his client base.   


Right now I am thinking I will go ahead and move in and try it, but really make sure I live the life I want. I'd keep my house (and rent it out) so I can always back out.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is very disjointed, but, any thoughts? Anyone ""settled down"" and loved it? Or walked away and been thrilled? Or other ideas?",30Apr2020,1

I can't stop thinking about her and wanting to talk to her because I care about her a lot, but I know she doesn't really talk to me or care about me anymore, not like she used to, and that's heartbreaking.

100,"Two months ago I thought it's all getting better. After my mental health was very bad since last year (it was bad for years but got even worse then) I reached for help. It wasn't perfect, but for the first time in so long I felt that it's going in the right direction. I was at the final months of university, even though I struggled with my dissortation because of depression, after starting medication I was getting better. Now I'm working on it but I don't know. I feel it's pointless. 

When the lockdown happened I thought it will pass quickly. I had troubles with going to my doctor so I stopped taking my meds for some time. But in this time my state got worse. I did get back on it but I had to start over (it took over a month for the SSRI to work at all). But that's only a short time help. I need therapy, but it's not possible. 

I thought it will pass quickly and go back to usual. Oh how wrong I was. Schools got closed, my uni was closed, so I didn't have classes, the place I worked also closed. But I didn't worry. I was one of a few people that were supposed to stay after everything will reopen, we were going to get more hours at work and a raise. But then everything was still closed. People was losing jobs, buisnesses fell. Our boss decided to close definitely because he couldn't afford to keep it when it didn't made any money. I'm left unemployed. And everything is still closed and it's going to be even more difficult to find a job (let alone a nice and good one) after all of this will end. But it might not end for months for what I know.

I had to give up my apartament, because my flatmate isn't going back there and I can't afford to pay the whole thing. I was going to rent it with my sister after we would finish uni and my friend would leave. But now it's not possible. 

I'm staying in my family home. But I don't know how long I could be here and not go crazy. My family is far from perfect, I don't feel good here tbh and there's no live here in this town. I had friends in the city I lived, I had better job opportunities. Maybe I even would have the opportunity to meet a guy and form a relationship. After years of hiding I wanted to go forward. And now I'm even worse than before. 

I know people have it worse. I'm physically healthy, I have a roof over my head, no one close to me died. But honestly I struggle with mental illness, I was going through existentional crisis already, I was anxious and depressed. And after it was getting a little bit better it got even worse. Now I'm afraid it will get even worse and I don't have the power to fight, I feel like I should give up.


Ok, it was long af so to summarize: Young girl struggling to finish uni, with depression and anxiety, lonely, lost job, had to give up my apartament that was my safe space and have to stay at family home, where I don't feel good. I don't know how much I can take.",30Apr2020,1

The path that i‚Äôve been looking for for so long seems so clear now, like, I know exactly what I want to do with my day now and how to go about doing it. The things that used to cause me sadness can‚Äôt phase me anymore, and seem really minor to me now. like, I was really mad over that? that!? seriously?

And watching videos that bring the issue to light really make me see how bad it was and not something I should be shrug off as ""shit happens"".

Last year was the worst year of my life and I needed emotional support more than anything but spent that time hiding and dealing with it on my own instead of speaking up. I felt so alone and that I couldn't trust anyone. I've been convinced for so long that people only have malicious intent towards me or just don't care because they have their own problems.

Our website works like any other retail website you've seen. Add thing to cart, go to checkout, checkout.   


We get lots and lots of calls from older people who want to place orders over the phone with a 'real human'. For security purposes we require all sales to go through the website. This pisses a lot of people off. When I first started working here I felt for some of them as the mere task of putting an order seemed daunting and truly upset some.   


That's when I realized these people being bad at technology is 100% their fault. Home computers have been commonplace since at least the early 90's (if not before) we're currently in 2020. These people have had over a quarter of a century to familiarize themselves with modern technology, the fact that they threw up their hands thirty years ago and refused to adapt does not make it my fault. They bitch and moan about how things are changing for the worse but in reality they're lazy. I'm not saying they have to be computer scientists but searching buying something on a standard retail website should not be a cause for distress.

114,"Work hours:-
{Breakfast and a quick workout when I wake up, watch tv/use computer for an hour then go to work}{When finishing work, ready to play video games by 11pm, usually sleep between 2 and 4 am}
Mon 2:30pm-10pm
Tue 2:30pm-10pm

Fri 6:30am-2:30pm
Sat 6:30am-2:30pm
Sun 6:30am-2:30pm {Sometimes this is just a day off instead}

In the afternoons on Thurs-Sun' I play video games, I don't usually work out on these days, i'm trying to learn how to cook slowly but surely so that I can more efficiently work out and gain weight. 

Every couple days I do my dishes. My mother literally picks my washing up twice a week and we do a swap with my dirty washing for the clean washing because I don't have a washer or dryer. 

Sometimes on my days off I have the dog over because it used to be mine but I let my mother keep her when I moved out cus my place is smol. 

Every month or two i'll do some LSD, I do also microdose shrooms for depression usually twice a week. 

I don't really save any money, I should but ¬£100 a week weed habit i'm trying to cut out. So really, I could save ¬£400 a month, potentially more. 

My plan for the next few years is to pass my car test, get a van, get a house (rented) and then finally get a dog and a shed in my garden. When I get to the point I feel my life will be complete and if i'm being completely honest might kill myself some years after. 

Don't ask why and don't bring that up in your comment I just wanted to be honest.

I don't think i'll be able to have the time or afford to change my job to something better for at least 3 years potentially more, but the thought is there. 

I don't wanna be a cashier forever.

Not sure what else to say, the video game I play the most is world of warcraft and i've worked out that I love mmorpgs because of the chat feature, a game without a chat feature isn't even a game to me because i'm so lonely. I have seriously gotten used to it but, I don't mind admitting that I love these games so much simply because it's real human interaction that isn't my job. That being said I think my job has helped me i've only worked there 9 months and before that I was a couch potato on ¬£500 a month give or take for years. I remember just sitting on the sofa every night thinking this is it, i'm gonna die in this flat. I couldn't find any work and I don't have a car, it was a miracle getting the job I have I just walked into a shop and the guy leaned over the counter and just goes

'yo, you wanna job?'

That was it. I stopped playing world of warcraft 18 hours a day and started working full time. After 2 months I was back on a daily weed habit but I actually haven't smoked any for like, 3 days so i'm doing pretty good right now - plan is to try and start smoking ¬£10 every weekend, maybe less than that. Just when I feel like it which shouldn't be every day.

I know the title says my schedule how would you change it but really what I wanted to say is my life - how would you change it.

What would you do.

I'm between a 4 and 6 on looks based on your perspective, closer to the 4. 

Personality is absoloutely shattered like if it was a piece of glass it's literally in pieces and the wind has even scattered the pieces so there's absoloutely no chance not even a miracle coould bring all those exact pieces back together and piece them back with no damage. 

It's fucked but I just hide it from people they don't know. Maybe some people know, but I don't go around saying hey i'm diagnozed schizophrenic with psychosis, split personality disorder some form of depression let's be honest and dissosociation.

There was more to the list of mental illnesses but you get the picture. I guess my life is about two things mainly if we aren't counting dogs.
