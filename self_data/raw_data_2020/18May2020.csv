0,"# I used to think social media and youtube were a gift in my life, because they connected me to people and ideas that were compatible to me especially because I lived a very lonely life and practiced a culture that doesn't align with what I believed in and what I wanted to do. But then depression came and social media became an escape and no longer a source of inspiration, I got sucked up in watching stupid people and secretly resenting their stupidness and praising my sanity and self awareness (as if that makes any better than them). I find it very difficult to practice a productive hobby right now, and I am scared because I know I'm slowly becoming this shallow and talent-less person when a few years academia and knowledge were my main goals. I'm not happy with what I do, I know I can't impress anyone anymore because I'm not as smart or talented I thought I am.",18May2020,1
1,"so i’m an extrovert at heart, but i was raised in isolation so i’m kind of shy right now because i’ve never had much social interactions at all, especially since i was home schooled... i want to let my talkative/outgoing side out, but every time i speak, no one listens. i’m the person where my comments get drowned out because someone else talks over me, and everyone pays attention to the other person... no matter how loud i’m being. these aren’t friends i can get rid of, they’re my family - no one cares what i have to say, they only ever listen to my sibling... so how can i find an outlet, where i can practice, when i’m constantly put down for opening my mouth? :/",18May2020,1
2,"I've learned I have a really good sense of smell. I always knew it was good, since every person smells different I almost use it in conjunction with visual and auditory information when recognizing someone (how a person looks, sounds, and smells!) but today I texted my roommate to cut extra cucumber for me, and they said how do u know I'm cutting cucumber and I said I can smell it and they freaked out. they tested a couple of other smells on me and was shocked and said I was a super human!

3,"I never did this before. This is new to me, so please bare with me.   This friend of mine that is no longer my friend, just admitted to raping me several times when I was drunk. I started to notice that by my second drink I was really feeling like I had drank the whole bottle. He was always wanting to make my drinks. For other reasons I decided to no longer be his friend. I asked him on several occasions if anything had happened, and he would always respond no. That he respected me to much for that. Well, today he messaged me that he did actually do many things to me while I was passed out. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know what to do.",18May2020,1

I have not opened it in fear of contamination, but I do look at it weekly for mold all over.

7,"Now that it is warm, I take a ride on my electric scooter around town every evening.  I know a lot of people hate scooterists, but I'm a cautious driver.  I follow all the traffic laws and I wear a helmet.  Because I'm 42.  I know I won't bounce back quick if I get into an accident, and I know I'm not invisible.  

I've never encountered hateration from other motorists before while I ride until just a few minutes ago.  I was riding down the street when an SUV pulled alongside me.  The front seat passenger threw liquid on me and laughed as the vehicle sped away.  Fortunately the liquid (turns out it was just water) just hit my feet and my scooter.  But it still pissed me off!  Immediately afterwards the driver behind the SUV pulled up alongside me and rolled down his window.  A young guy, with locks.  Cute. 

""Did you know those guys?"" he asked, the two of us still in motion.
""No,"" I said.  I could hear my voice and it sounded sad.  Was I sad?  I guess I was. 
""You want me to get the plates?""
""Naw, don't worry about it,"" I said, trying to be cool.  ""But thanks though!""

But I don't know if he heard me.  I watched as he sped off after the SUV. I pulled the throttle on my scooter and followed as best I could.  The driver in the SUV seemed to sense he was being chased, because he turned a corner real abruptly and accelerated.  The guy with the locks was right behind him though.  I turned the corner and kept on a little ways, watching the tail lights go around another corner.  When I heard the screeching wheels, I decided to give up the chase. As pumped as I was, I didn't want to watch the ending of the story.  I turned around and scootered home.

Not gonna lie, I love that the guy with the locks was incensed on my behalf.  And for a split second, I really did want to see him exact justice on my behalf, even if it was disproportionate.  I wanted to watch him pull the passenger out of the SUV and cuss him out.  I wanted him to drag him over to me and make his punk-ass apologize.  I wanted all of that.

But now that the adrenaline is gone, I really hope he didn't do anything.  Yes, those people (or at least the passenger) was an asshole. Splashing me like that was mean and potentially dangerous.   But I'd hate to turn on the 11 o'clock news tonight and find out that guy with the locks has caught a charge over this foolishness.  How many guys are sitting in prison over similar foolishness?  A whole lot of them.  We don't need anymore.",18May2020,1

10,"Bear with me here, I'm a teenager so I'm a little stupid but I see people talking about working on themselves all the time and I don't even know what that means, specifically in the realm of mental health. I guess I've tried to work on myself in the eras of self esteem, anxiety etc. But I've made zero progress. Like, I used to be chubby and sad so I started working out, trying to eat better and such. Now I'm skinny, sad and found a new insecurity that can't be fixed without surgery. I ""improved"" myself but still feel the same. Even the natural dopamine that is released from working out doesn't seem to do anything for me. I guess going to therapy is also part of self improvement with mental health, but that is the one thing I've been recommended that I have not (and cannot) try.

But of course I'm worried because I don't want to bring any germs home to my parents on like my clothes or whatever, who knows. 
So, I buy a ridiculous mask, and a full on plastic hazmat-style poncho to cover my whole body. Because your girl is paranoid and extra af. And even though we're all pretending the virus is gone, it isn't people.

I get to the airport and I'm the only one wearing a hazmat poncho and people are laughing at me and secretly snapping photos. And I'm embarrassed and also like, whatever, I'm a badass. Anyway some dude says something.Cause of course. Jackasses can't be quiet.

However, about 3 months ago my siblings have begun to make jokes about my attempt, often saying “oh you were so dramatic” and “i can’t believe you would actually try to kill yourself”.

21,"I'm only 16 but this has been bugging me for over a week now. I've always been scared to grow up and scared to die. I'm afraid that I'll become out of touch, that I'll become decrepit and senile, that everything will change. I loved the culture that was present in the early 2010s and I'm struggling to deal with the end of many things I always thought would be with me forever. There will be kids who grow up not experiencing the events, books, shows, movies, and culture that I did. If I die any legacy I leave behind will inevitably be forgotten. I don't want to just die and lose the memories of the amazing things I've experienced. I want to keep my memories and personality while continuing to make more. I want all the people I know and love to last along with me. Sometimes I'm comforted by religion but I end up doubting its feasibility eventually. As a kid I hoped that we would somehow find a cure to aging within the next few years but seeing how long things have taken so far, I fear that a good portion of the people I value will have passed by then. And if we were somehow do develop eternal life, we would have to deal with overpopulation and a radical redefining of traditions, social norms, and the way death is depicted in media. And even if we do somehow solve those we would have to deal with preventing boredom for all of eternity. After a few thousand, million, or even billion years we would probably run out of things to do or see even with the constant invention of new fields and areas of interest. There are only so many skills to develop and so many stories to make. Dying then would mean the loss of countless memories. If the afterlife did exist a similar dilemma would occur. And if the afterlife is just existence and eternal bliss then what's the point? That would be no different from being high on drugs 24/7. I don't know what to do right now as eventually it will all be meaningless. Me and everything I know and love will be forgotten or I will eventually suffer a miserable mind numbing existence forever.

28,"I just hate it man. No matter what I accomplish or what I do in life I always have this massive lack of self-esteem. I always think the worst, always doubt myself and my relationships with people, never have any confidence in anything I’m doing. In dating it really holds me back; I’m 21 and literally have had zero dating experience. Every time I feel that initial spark with someone I get too caught up in my head, I overthink, my mind becomes like an emotional rollercoaster; one minute I’m convinced we’re into each other and it’s all gonna go amazing, and then at the slightest perceived negative thing I’m convinced they hate me, find me annoying and wish I’d leave them alone. I spend so long overthinking like this, scared to make a move, and eventually they end up dating someone else, just plain losing interest if it was even ever there in the first place, whatever. It never works out cause I’m my own worst enemy.

Right now I’m really into a girl who I’ve kind of been friends with for years but who I’ve got really close with over the past couple of months. Before corona we were on a night out and we both ended up on our own, and for some reason had one of the biggest heart to hearts I’ve ever had about our own issues with mental health, fears, all that shit. Ever since then I’ve cared a lot about her. She knows I like her cause it’s an open secret amongst our friends which we all joke about, so for once I didn’t have to face the uncertainty; she knew straight up how I felt, and even after that she wasn’t scared off, and we were getting closer and closer; messaging everyday, on our weekly zoom call with out friends we’d flirt like hell to the point we’d get called out on it, and just in general we’ve got very close. Last night on a zoom call with our friends she told me she feels like out of all our friends I’m the one she’s closest to, that she really misses me and can’t wait to see me when this is all over, etc. I won a bet with her recently and we agreed when lockdown restrictions lift we’ll meet up so she can give me my prize, so we’ve even kind of made excuses to try hang out. Sometimes it feels great.

But the thing is, she’s been talking to someone else for a couple of weeks who’s she’s arranged a date with after all this, and who it seems to be going really, really well with. And I just feel like shit about it and feel like an idiot. If only I hadn’t been so fucking scared and unsure of myself and just asked her out like weeks ago when I thought it was all going good. I’m a fucking adult, and here I am acting like an insecure 12 year old with his first crush. Sure, she might not feel the same and just want to be friends; in fact, that’s probably very likely, and I’d be fine with that. After all, she knows how I feel and we just joke about it while she wants to date other people. But what if I did have a chance, what if there was some point in the past couple of months of us talking that I could have asked her out and she’d have said yes? What if she got fed up of waiting for me to make a move and just got on with her life? We even fucking joked about the idea of us going on a date after this, for once in my life I think I actually had a good shot.

But instead I’m in the same cycle of getting to know someone, connecting with them, only to hold myself back cause I’m too fucking scared, have such massively low self-esteem which is only reinforced by me sabotaging myself, and in the end just hurt myself. It fucking sucks. I’ve tried a lot of things; I’ve been to therapy, I’ve tried mindfulness, I’ve tried working out, I’ve really worked hard in college, I’ve tried Tinder, I’ve tried dressing better, I’ve done charity work, I’ve accomplished a lot of things I should be proud of, but instead I feel no pride in anything I do, none of it boosts me up at all, and none of it changes the fact I fundamentally don’t like myself. Hell, I’ve basically just got my college degree and I barely felt a hint of happiness or pride. Even if I did date someone I liked, that would never change, and it just hurts man. People always say ‘you need to love yourself before you can love someone else’, and it’s true as shit, but how do you even do that? I don’t feel like I can.",18May2020,1

39,"I feel it happening again. The perpetual, endless cycle that is my bipolar disorder taking hold of me once more. 

Everything feels so serene. Colors are bright and vibrant, so sharp and crisp. 
And everything has this ""glow"" to it. 
I feel manic,  but this time it's *different.* 

Just as bright as everything seems, I can also feel a darkness encroaching my mind. 

I caught myself, talking to myself, on my back porch just a few minutes ago. 
I was berating myself, talking down to myself. 

More specifically it has to do with reddit actually.  Last week I was browsing post in r/bipolar2 and I came across a post about this person who was severely depressed. 
They spoke of being alone, and having no one. They spoke of the struggles of announcing to their parents that they where trans. I dug through thier profile history and noticed that this person post every.single.day. in multiple subreddits like this one.

After I read a few of them it was clear this person needed somebody, they where on a path of self destruction, and they had quite a few post about self harm and suicidal thoughts. 
I know thier pain. I know it all to well. The loneliness. The self hatred.  The feeling of worthlessness. The struggle for acceptance. I feel it to my very core. 

Almost all of this person's post have only one, or 0 upvotes and rarely any comments. 
They don't get the advice or answers they seek. Repeatedly they are cast aside, with nobody to reach out a hand. 

I contemplated messaging them but truthfully, I didn't care enough to be bothered. I was feeling emotionally numb, and I wasn't the overly empathetic person I usually am. 

**But now I do care! Now I want to help!**

Now it's to late  I don't know who or where that person is. 

And im so mad at myself for not helping. 

I don't know why this person came back into my head again. I just know it hurts so fucking bad to think that they are out there struggling alone. Just like me. 
And I could have done something. I could have made a new friend. I could have helped this person. 

But now they are gone.. 

And I am left with regret that will serve as a catalyst for the depression that will stand side by side with my mania. 

Im a hypocrite. I know intimately the struggles that come with bipolar disorder. 
And I know how hard it can be too get the help and support needed for it. 
And I know what happens when you don't get that help and support. 

I feel like with this knowledge it's my duty, my moral obligation to help those I can with the same struggles as me. After all who better can understand it. 

And yet I did *Nothing.* 

It just further proves I'm just as cold and selfish as the rest of us. 

Like that video I seen of someone who got stabbed in NYC. as they lay bleeding out on the sidewalk dozens, upon dozens of people just walk by without a second glance. Nobody cared, and that person died because nobody helped. 

That was me when I read this person's post, like I was one of the people who just kept on walking. Only caring about myself. 

I write this with tears sliding down my face.  
If you're reading this I want you to know that I learned a valuable lesson, and that in the future I wont be so selfish.

There is a quote that I love, and it goes like this: 
""Be the change you want to see in the world.""

One time someone who used to be a good friend betrayed me and left me in the dust. Few days after I got a job phone call asking me about him, now I could have said something to sabotage his chances, but I didnt, I just couldnt find it in me.

 Another time I went through a horrible breakup, I tell this person ""Get well in health, take care..."" rather than say ""Good bye and I hope to never see you again"" she said ""Thank you for wasting my time"" while in reality she wasted mine from a outsider perspective cause she sat on her ass all day playing video games while I was the one taking her out to dates, places, shopping and doing some handiwork. Now one might say, nobody asked you or made you do it. I just did it. 

I may help others, but I refuse the help of others (except my close friends), a part of me believes people harbor secondary intentions when helping me out. I just cant find it in me to believe in people. You may ask why do I have such an attitude, is because I have been betrayed, many times.

48,"Disclaimer: I am a young healthy male. I never tested for Corona, nor do I claim that I actually had it. Just take what I say as you will. I also don’t have the best memory, but I can get extra details tomorrow (writing this late)

Context: 
My mom had returned home from south India during mid December. The closest we got was a hug I think, and there wasn’t too much contact aside form that. My mom caught her own bad illness in South India, where they diagnosed her with H1N1. However, when she came back she was pretty much fine as far as I remember. 

Later that night I felt an itch in my throat, which is what I always felt before the regular flu. When I woke up on Monday, I didn’t feel that great but got through school. I felt all the normal flu symptoms and ended up feeling worse the next day (chills, fatigue, super high fever, and maybe loss of taste? I lost all my appetite for sure tho)

Keep in mind I don’t have a great immune system, and my usual flu’s last at most 3 days. 

I started feeling worse and worse by Tuesday and Wednesday, to the point where I was in bed for EVERYTHING except going to the bathroom. Once the weekend hit, it didn’t get much better and I started suffering, because I felt more sick than I ever had, and it wasn’t going away. 

I would miss the next week of school as well, and I ended up getting tested for the flu. The test couldn’t confirm the flu. My memory gets pretty blurry here, but I recall going in another time, but I know I got diagnosed with the flu. 

After a little less than two weeks (that Sunday night to the following Friday), I was finally alright, but I had never felt such short of breath doing things EVER. 


What’s weird is I got super sick again about a week or so later(?). By this time my mom was fine, but I had a close friend who was hella sick. But I also got sick for two weeks again!! Which had never happened to me before. This time doctors said I had the flu, which was a bit confusing. 

Btw right after that I was trying to get back in shape ASAP and I got exercised induced asthma symptoms. That’s how out of it I was. 



At the end of the day, I’m fine now but I wonder if I actually had it or nah. Hopefully this serves a warning to you that even if you’re young, this shit makes you suffer even if you’re healthy, and I don’t even know if I had it.",18May2020,1
49,"I have gone through my entire adult life without my family knowing that I was attacked and raped. I don’t know why, but I have never been able to make myself tell them.

I want to participate in things like the  #MeToo movement, and I want others to know my story and learn from it. I want to be happy, ok and brave. I’ve told friends over the years and my husband knows my whole story, but for some reason I am so scared to tell me family about what happened to me.

I have no reason to be terrified like I am. My family is made of loving, kind, open and fiercely supportive people. They would love and support me, but they would pity me. And I was raised to be strong. I was raised to be independent and brave.

But I’m none of those things.

I am scared and small.

I've had a few very very short term relationships( longest being 8 months) and the reason why they all end is cause of the distance and I understand that. My friends have told me to change my job but I frankly cannot do a desk job at this age. Will be shifting over to company operations once I'm a bit more senior (6-7 years more). 

Cause of this job / relationship predicament, I've come to terms with being single all my life, and frankly, it's a bit liberating. Though,  I feel a bit lonely from time to time, just coming to terms with it feels a bit good.

I wanted to help, but I made things worse. I know your past was tough. And that's an understatement. I know that sometimes it's hard to be you. I remember those moments when you said you wanted to be your best self around me. I remember you telling me that you've felt happy for the first time in so long. That made me even happier.

I know that I had to let go. That I had to move on with my life. Part of me felt, in our last communications I was asking you to cut me loose. I couldn't do it myself. There's no one else that I want. No one in the world that has ever made me feel those ways. Is that true for you? Even know I can't let go of that hope. I tried all I could to crush it, but it keeps growing back. I know you told me that I should stop waiting. And part of me has. But the truth is, there will always be a place for you in my life.

I hope wherever you are, that you have people to go to when things aren't going so well. I hope that you never have to suffer alone. And you never have to suffer alone. So please, don't do it on purpose. You deserve to be happy. Despite anything you may think.

I'm glad you found me. I hope you find me again.

I'll always be yours,

53,"cog in a machine carries a negative connotation... The face of a clock carries a positive one.  


Try running the clock with a missing cog, time stops.

The people we consider cogs, insignificant, are the ones that make the world turn. They are the unsung heroes, they are the ones that show up. They do 100% of the work 100% of the time. There are many of them, they are plentiful.

The face of the clock, definitely less of them than cogs. Bright, airy, attractive, enticing, attention whores. Fleeting, they face everyone and the sun, they're exposed, unprotected, they decay quickly.

It's funny how often CEOs change, they burn bright, hot, and short. Key employees stick around in a company a very long time and without much fanfare. They are admired and looked up to by other employees. Most CEOs don't know who they are or that they owe their success to them.

55,"I hold a lot of resentment towards my sibling; we will call him Alfred. He has saved a ton over the years, much of this due to the fact my parents paid for virtually everything 1. Paid for his schooling and rent during school 2. He now lives with my parents and does not pay for his phone bill, never groceries, no room rent, no car payment, and no subscriptions (uses my parents’ amazon, Netflix, etc). My parents have asked him to buy groceries and he says he “does not like shopping for groceries.” I think it’s actually because he’s cheap. But he doesn’t have a problem eating the groceries for free.... Alfred was supposed to pay a couple hundred for rent but he never did and because of his angry outbursts, my parents are too afraid to ask. He insults my parents and I find it despicable. I once asked him why he doesn’t pay for more of his things since he’s financially stable and he said they “never asked for those certain things to be paid.” My parents have no problem taking my money for the bills (phone, car etc and I have my own subscriptions) but I do give it to them voluntarily cause I feel like it’s that right thing to do. I think he should pay a little rent and pay for his bills like I do.

I know if I didn’t volunteer to pay, I doubt my parents would ask me for all the $, but they would ask me for some as they have charged me in the past if I didn’t pay in a certain amount of time. I go grocery shopping for them most weekends (I probably do this every weekend except 1 out of the month) which.surmounts to about $100-$200 a week, run errands which. Hold be $, pay my bills and offer my time and make them a priority. They don’t offer to pay back nor do I ask. 

I am resentful that my brother is so cheap with them and swindles his way out of paying for so many things while being so ungrateful and calling them stupid and being rude. How do I hold a better perspective about this and not be resentful and angry? Sometimes I feel like not paying either because he gets away with so much and I am jealous of his savings account.

Now I came to the conclusion that I indeed had a gambling problem.  I know Covid19 sucks and a lot of people have lost their careers or worst like a family or friend.

68,"I’m 21/F for context. I’ve been a lurker here on reddit for years, and this is my first serious post. 

I’m pretty confident that the people around me are a little tired of my sad rants, so I’m coming here for objective advice.

I grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional, very Christian family. We moved, alot. Almost too much. I went to 4 or 5 different elementary schools &amp; 2 middle schools, to put it in perspective. I’m in college now and I’m a writer. 

Now, what I struggle with is feeling like I belong. I don’t feel like a part of any community. It’s hard to explain this feeling because it’s so abstract. I almost feel like an outcast, and I’ve always had difficulty maintaining friendships. Recent spells of depression and anxiety don’t help my case. Although, I’m generally an outgoing person, I’m easy to get along with, I would like to think that people see me as a pleasant person. I also have the gift and curse of being incredibly self-aware and sensitive, I’ve heard this plenty of times before. 

Still, I feel like I don’t connect with anyone. So many friendships are surface level, and we don’t have much in common. I just want to feel understood or welcome. I want to feel like I have a safe space. This could all be made up in my head. I yearn to feel like I’m wanted. I read somewhere that the downside of being apart of a community is the requirement to conform to a certain mindset to fit in. What do you think? 

I guess I’m asking for advice. Have any of you felt this way? Could it be physical isolation (quarantine) that heightens feelings of loneliness? What steps would you guys take to  address these feelings, then do something about it? 

I apologize if this is too vague. Feel free to pick my brain or ask me to elaborate. I’m pretty scatterbrained. 

TL;DR: I lack a sense of belonging leading to me feeling super lonely. How should I address this?",18May2020,1

70,"I am a very self sufficient person. Meaning that I don’t require/need any human contact to be happy or function, but I am generally happier when hanging out with a small group of people for a limited time (ie 3 hour per every 5-9 days sort of thing). Due to this fact though I am prone to very short “friendships/relationships” (If you can call them that) because most people need more human contact than that to create those bonds, and will almost always drift away after a week or two. So my question is: does anyone have any ideas on how I can create longer lasting friendships that have a deeper emotional depth than simple acquaintances, without me “faking” enjoyment with them?

 (I am very bad with words so forgive me but what I am trying to say is that yes I understand that I can force myself to hangout with people for more time but eventually I am going to have reduce the time I hangout with them or else I would start to hate the person and therefore make the friendship meaningless, but once I reduce the time with them they just start to drift away and it just seems like a waste of time and effort at that point). 

Now to the romantic part of this question, I believe that I have romantic and sexual feelings for people (I only say believe as I haven’t ever been in a relationship of that kind) but the problem I have is that I don’t think I can sustain any romantic relationship unless it was with someone who has a personality generally like mine. This inevitably leads me to the thought how in the world do two very reclusive people meet each other and interact between them on a level that can lead to a romantic relationship without some insane amount of luck?",18May2020,1

80,"I honestly don't know the best how I got to the mental state I did, but I feel disoriented completely. In my younger years I figured out free will doesn't exist and thought the natural implication of fairness and no free will would be that everyone deserves a life of equal happiness. I brought that to people and they consistently have shown me that they either do not care that free will doesn't exist or that my supposed implication of equality is wrong. I have stopped believing in the goodness of people fundamentally because of this.

If I lived according to how I view fairness, I would live like a peasant, trying to support those who can't get a good job etc. There are many dumb people out there or disabled or whatever, and they can't produce value like me. If I keep them afloat, I will necessarily be poor like them. That's okay. But if the sociopath next door to me with the same job as me doesn't sympathize, then here in 20 years he is gonna have millions and I'll probably still have very little. I am worried these sociopaths will use their monetary power to dominate me and those I keep afloat. I feel worried that unless I can force the sociopath with violence to give in equal amounts as me, that they will eventually rule me.

Even if we did instate some sort of empathy universal law, of the distribution of goods, those who take in times that the law can't see will always have better lives than those truly living according to empathy by principle. Sociopaths would then have slightly better lives over time. It makes me think empathy and sympathy for those that cannot produce value wouldn't have survived evolution. It makes me think they are just people with god delusions, or remnants of the god delusion and fear of social judgement from those that do believe in god.

Idk, I guess it just feels like everyone I talk to is a sociopath at heart. They talk to me about shit and I just feel like they are trying to delude and lie to me.

I have become unhinged. I can't relax around people. I worry I will be attacked by people regularly in my interactions, that they will rob me or something.

I think maybe I am being paranoid, but I listen to modern rap music and it is literally just the definition of promoting violence, dominance, and a lack of sympathy empathy. I look back to older times and we had kings and queens...

86,"Not even ""when does it get better"" but just when does it stop? When I was a little kid, I had what I know now was depression, anxiety, OCD, and insomnia. I used to recite the rhyme about the old man who hit his head and didn't wake up in the morning, and hope I wouldn't either. I had bad social problems and was basically feral. I stopped eating for a while, but when nothing physically wrong was found, I was told to stop being dramatic. I thought I would choke but I couldn't explain that and wasted away while they just kept sending me to my room with cold food. That's how they parented. Eventually, I made myself eat because I would have starved. Something happened when I was 7. My brother beat me black and blue daily till nearly the end of high school, but boys will be boys and I should have hurried up and I shouldn't have stood up to him. 

When I was 10, I hit puberty and the gender dysphoria I had came roaring out like fire. But this was a different time and my mom told me to stop being so dramatic and wear the damn bra. When I realized there was no way out, I shut down. When I was 12, she nearly died and spent over a year hospitalized. I fell through the cracks and my mental health issues grew and grew. I didn't know how to talk to people at school, and would hide in the corner with my face hidden. But that was ok, cause we didn't have mental health then back then. 

By the time I was 13, I was drinking, smoking, cutting myself, numb, dissociated, trapped between OCD and suicidal ideation and gender dysphoria. I tried once but failed. I stayed drunk until I was 17. My parents cared about grades. I kept those up. Nothing else was ever talked about, other than to say I should smile more because I was so pretty when I smiled. I had everything handed to me and I should be grateful. I dropped out of college when I was 20 because I couldn't handle my sexuality, gender, the lack of trees, my inability to do math and get a PhD like dad expected and had started drinking again.

I met a guy. I was too naive to know people like him existed, but they do. Eight years later, after he had spent the money my grandfather left me and burned through my student loans, damaged my relationship with my family, drove away all my friends and turned me into something I no longer recognized, I managed to leave him, believing I was the monster. My parents knew I was going hungry and was scared but they were angry at me and it was my fault. A few months later, I met the partner who just left me, and she helped me with the panic attacks the came with the PTSD setting in. I don't know if I loved her, but we needed each other in that moment. She got out of a bad situation by coming to live with me. Eventually, I was lost to the PTSD. She left for a year. In that year, I lived in my parents' basement living mainly on peanut butter and silence, because they were too angry at me for me to feel safe upstairs. 

I picked the wrong psychiatric nurse and ended up overmedicated so badly I have very few memories of the following 5 years. I gained so much weight from the medication and being unable to leave the house that I got diabetes. It took me two years to taper off all the medications. I finally figured out all the gender stuff and got started with that but my family can't accept it. I'll always be their little girl. My ex-partner and I got married last summer. Our 1 year anniversary would have been in two days, but she left me 3 days after I started testosterone. But that's ok, because I didn't love her romantically anyway and she deserves better. We're friends, and roommates. Which is good because I don't have any other friends in real life anymore. I did try to love her but it didn't work. And while I should have been loving her, I was falling for what I thought was a friend, who really was just....I don't know. I don't know what they were. I do know their behavior became so manipulative I have to walk away even though I love them. I never wrote my ex-partner a poem, but I've written so many to them. 

I'm losing my health insurance in June, and have no career and no prospects. Losing my health insurance means I'll never have top surgery or a hysto and that I have to keep living with dysphoria for the rest of my life and I'll die with these parts still there.

92,"So I am writing this while I am laying in bed, procrastinating. I have to send some emails and do some basic research, which has been pending for 2-3 weeks now. And I have to do it as soon as possible since a critical deadline is approaching. I know I have to do this. I am thinking about doing it. I have time right now. Yet I am not doing it, and I have no idea why.

Whenever the thought comes of doing any task, a parallel thought comes in immediately, of wasting time in some way or another. When I was sitting on my desk, looking at my inbox for 10 seconds, thinking about writing the mail, I impulsively opened a new tab instead and opened YouTube. Disgusted with myself, I closed the tab..and after a few more seconds of deliberation, I lay on my bed. Now the impulsive thought is to open the incoginito window, so that I can masturbate. But I have already masturbated not so long ago today, and am not really horny right now. But everytime I think of doing the task at hand, my mind immediately diverts to something else.

Am I afraid of something? Am I afraid of failing? no. Do I want perfection? Not really. Am I afraid of the amount of work that needs to be done? Probably. But is this just the reason? Afraid of doing work, and looking for instant gratification? This just makes me lazy. Sure, that happens with everyone. But I literally ruined my life by not working in my last 2 years of college. I did not study a single day. I barely passed, when I should have been among the toppers (I have a history of performing well all through my academic career). I was one of the only few people in my whole college that did not get a job. The problem might be something deeper, but I can't figure out what it is.

94,"I want to preface by saying that I Began a journey to become a teacher in 2013.  It's been a wild ride to the point where I don't think any other teacher in history has had a crazy journey. Here is a timeline:

2013: I started

2014: I lost a scholarship after failing a course then I took the same course with a different teacher the next semester and passed. 

2015: I have one class left before I can transfer and I completely bomb in it. I failed both the midterm and final but he teacher saw I was trying to become a teacher and not a scientist and worked with me to pass the class. 

2016: Nothing really happens in terms of craziness until the very last day of the year. 

2017: Oh boy where do I begin with this one? It started out with a kiss how did it end up like this? Seriously though, it started out with my dad cheating on my mom and it turned into this whole clusterfuck of crap. I also began to student teach at this time too. It builds up a domestic violence situation that I had to call the police over and I still have PTSD from it. I wasn't allowed in my house for almost three days and this is while I'm trying to student teach. Then my cat died a week later. Then the lady that my dad was seeing, messaged me and attempted to stalk/do I don't know what to me. In all of this, my mentor teacher bullied me and was not only sexist to me but made sexual comments towards me that made me feel uncomfortable. I reported this information to higher ups and they did not believe me despite having evidence. It was essentially sexual harassment. I then left student teaching because I couldn't take working with someone that I did not feel safe with not to mention I didnt feel safe at home either. Then a summer came by where i was severely depressed. I then tried to student teach again in the fall. I was so behind because of everything that happened that I failed again. Not to mention, I was told later on by the mentor I had that a few boys in the class had conspired to disrupt anything I did in the class. Not even joking this really happened. After that I take up a job as a paraprofessional because I still wanted to be a teacher despite failing student teaching two times. 

2018: My state was part of the wave of teacher strikes that occurred in the Spring. I graduated with my bachelors in a useless field and began a masters degree in special education.

2019: The first half of the year was pretty normal and pretty good. However When the Fall of 2019 comes around things change. As a Paraprofessional I was switched classrooms to a different teacher even though I did not want to. Anyway this was a classroom with non-verbal students and it was a very difficult room to work with. Oddly with my previous student teaching experiences it was not the hardest. Anyway the semester started out with a sub since the lead teacher was pregnant. Well she comes back and I don't know why butte she was very mean to me for no reason whatsoever. She would yell at me infant of students and just say that i was difficult to work with yet my other co-workers were dumbfounded because they all liked me. To add another plot twist to this story, turns out this teacher went to the same high school and graduated the same year as me. I have no idea if I did something to her i high school but I don't even remember her from that time. This cummilates into an incident where she yells at me in front of several staff members who later come to me in private telling me they think how she's treating me is wrong. This is all going on while I'm having health issues that require doctor visits and tests and my father not on his meds again told me to hang myself because I asked my parents to not argue while I was eating dinner. Luckily for me my third time student teaching was the next semester and I left not looking back. 

2020: I began my third time student teaching. Everything was going great and I was succeeding this time. Then a fucking pandemic occurs in the middle of it and I didn't get to finish my experience. My university worked with me and I finished my masters course last week.But that brings us to today.

I texted my mentor about something and she comments about my student teaching experience so I decide to tell her about my previous attempts to say that even with a pandemic, this isn't the weirdest thing to have happened to me She replies with someone along the lines of well you must be prepared then. But the way it came across was off like it was not meant in a positive tone. I sent a follow up and even apologized but I've heard nothing yet

Did I ruin my relationship with my mentor teacher? AM I overreacting? Sorry for the long text but its needed to understand this story.",18May2020,1

My mom is probably one of the most miserable middle aged women on the planet and gets very easily triggered and takes her shit out on me. She’s done this her entire life and I’m approaching my mid 20’s. I was out for the weekend and, not even exaggerating, I wasn’t here even *10 minutes* before she starts some shit. My room is in the basement and she’s been using it to work out, which I don’t bother her about. But most people would have the common decency to move the furniture back before I came home. Instead my couch is moved across the room and my heavy ass coffee table is moved right up against my TV again. So I ask in the most polite way possible “could you please stop moving my coffee table?” She lost it.

105,"I started to drink occationaly after my girlfriend left me, and the constant denial of women didn't make it easier. It got to a point in where I shut myself down everytime I met one. That wasn't even rock bottom.

I learned a year later, that true to my feelings, the girl I first were trying to be properly together with, was my true love. Because everytime I was around her, I never thought about wooing her, and the conversations we had was the best stimulation I have ever gotten. So I tried my best to get close to her,  and we did start meeting regularly. Those weeks were a blast! I were always afraid to lose her, so every now and then, when i saw there was a party she was invited to, I never skipped it. I were also paranoid that if I wasn't around i would lose my shot at this opportunity.

I decided to take my best friend along with her, because I was so proud to be starting to get this close to someone I genuinly had feelings for. Well. True to my beliefs. They ended up getting closer then I was hoping for, a week or two later they ended up together. I was both shocked, and dissapointed in the both of them. I didn't talk to my friend for weeks on end. 

Some months later I decided: ""screw this, I am being both selfish and childish"" So I started visiting them and slowly getting back on track with my friend, although I tried to stay professional around the girl.

2 weeks after the last party, and the last time i saw her, she took her life. She drove off into a wall.             I thought that this can't be real, nothing about what I heard seems to be real at that point. The day afterwards we gathered around the scene. That day I lost both my best friend and my friend.

I didn't cry, for that would be pointless, I consulted my friend and said that he was a good man for making her happy during the span of their relationship. Although I knew her longer than anyone there that day, I didn't cry. I only remembered the good times we had together.

I thought to myself that if that ever happened to me, I wouldn't want to live.

Flash forwards 1 month later.

I got myself a new good paying job. I earn way above average, but I live alone, and bitter. I drank even more to soothe, my inner loneliness and longing for the girl I lost both my shot and the opportunity of having a good, last conversation with. Along side a friend that was there for me, but ended up needing me even more.

I drank about a six pack everyday, and a bottle of booze, sometimes even more beer in the weekend.

I felt great, but also even worse.

The day for the funeral came, I bought a new suit. At the last moment I never showed up. I couldn't bear it. 

It had been 2 years, and during the virus spread, I started to slow down drinking, to a semi-healthy degree. untill i decided to only buy alcohol free instead, the taste was awfull, but hey! I could drink more without suffering. I also started to visit her grave every week, but my friend has lost connection with me. 

I am not bitter anymore, but i lost my appetite. I am way more satisfied with my life right now, than I was before. I still miss her, alot. And my mind most of times wanders about the life after death. I am still a hopeless romantic!

Thanks for reading, it means alot for me.

125,"I'm not an anime person at all.

So I recently started watching naruto with my 13 year old brother cos he was just getting into it and I wanted to see what the hype was all about and maybe also have something we could do together cos we don't have many common interests. No doubt it's a great show. It's been like two weeks of watching at least 2 episodes a day since I joined him and it's been kind of fun. But yesterday he got pissed at me for a petty reason and told me not to watch with him. I decided to continue on my own today and binged like 14 episodes and teased him with minor spoilers to have a laugh.

But now that I look at the number of episodes and spinoffs, the posts on r/naruto and think of how ridiculously geeky some of my friends got over anime 2 years ago and some still today, I don't think I'm really into that. I mean it's not bad, but I just don't enjoy it as much as I would have maybe when I was 9 and crazy about dragon ball z. It kind of makes me sad that it's a little predictable to me and I just don't get as excited by the fight scenes as most people I know would.

140,"I’m 18 male.  
  
I’m a college student living abroad with 3 other roommates, who are students of the same uni as well.  
  
I was always an introvert. I always loved gaming, anime, and netflix. The usual low standards stuff. My glowing personality prevails when I used to chat with previous friends in the ps4. Sadly that’s not a thing anymore. I left them behind for college; leaving my ps4 as well. I’m still in touch with them, but only through texting. They stopped texting me (with that I mean a chat with them is never initiated from them). The only way to maintain chatting with them is texting them first. If I don’t do anything, it’s like everything will be forgotten.  
  
Enough talking about the past now. I’ll talk about how my morale was right before I traveled, saying good bye to my parents.  
  
I was so enthusiastic. I extracted every optimism possible to have a head start to deal with much responsibilities showing up, such as cleaning the house, bills, etc etc. I’m doing well. I’m fighting my way through responsibilities very well. I’m not struggling with money. I learned how to cook tremendously fast, although I had zero experience when I used to live with my parents.  
  
Speaking about my social interactions. I feel so afflicted.  
  
When I met new friends, it started with exciting smiles and energy. Laughing and shit until I slowly started to talk less and then less and less as time passes. I reached the point I’m being seen very quite.  
  
My new “friends” (I don’t think I consider them to be but let just stick with calling them that), are so immature. I even had a friend, who’s 3 years younger than, is a lot more mature than my current owns. They make dirty jokes unprofessionally. One of them makes moaning noise in weird moments. They picture me as the victim of a rape, for jokes. It’s nothing serious to be worried about. It’s probably typical for any of them, but I’m not enjoying their shit humor. They over use filthy humor a lot and it’s get stupid and stressful. My previous friends were far more sarcastic and they used to make the filthiest of jokes in a professional way that makes me die of laughter.  
  
I lost all my will to attempt to show up to any of my current friends (my roommates and some others). I’m always in my room, and I never get out to not see them. They fucked up my sleep schedule after they kept inviting other friends to loudly chat and play cards until 3:00am - 5:00am. I usually sleep from 10:00pm and wake up at 7:00, but due to the online classes, my friends just stay awake the entire night. I literally just wait hearing their non stop noise of talking through the night, like a couple time a week. I cannot enjoy true peace when it’s bed time. Sitting with them doesn’t work at all. I cannot talk. It’s impossible. All of their topics are too fucking irrelevant to me. I had football. Them and I have no common interests. It drives me insane.  
  
If you’re asking why i’m living with roommates, it’s because my parents were scared I’d go lonely being alone. I have to mention, everyone around me are people whom I’ve never known before till I travelled last December.  
  
I’m so much in emotional pain and mentally. I’m intensely craving physical attention from someone I deeply love or who would look lovable. I miss my parents. Calling them doesnt help. They just tell me to stop whining snd hold on. I miss the sleeping between 22:00 and 00:00 and waking up at a reasonable time. I hate how irritating noises torturing me. I cannot get to enjoy roaming in the house without the presence of strangers, that drive me to limit my natural behavior.

141,"Before anyone accused me of trolling. I’m not. I’m being dead ass serious. This shit has been on my mind for a while today but today I got really triggered by this shit. It’s to much. 

I believe woman should not be able to drive legally. I can only speak for two states that I’ve lived in. But I’ve noticed a common factor woman drivers are almost as bad as Asian drivers. Now, we can’t ban Asians from driving that would be a form of racism. But we can make it so woman aren’t allowed to drive, that would be a form of sexism and woman are already used to being second class citizens and being respected less than men. 

I know statistically woman get in less accidents compared to men. But I know we can all agree on this. Men, drive like jack ass’s we do reckless stuff, we like to rip donuts, take off at stop lights, do burn outs, etc. Yes those things mentioned are definitely dangerous to others but significantly more dangerous to the persons in the vehicle. On the other hand there’s the woman. Who 4/5 woman I see on the road driving are on their phones whether it’s them driving or at a red light. That is considerable more dangerous to other people. I’m only calling out woman on this because I see a lot more woman do this than men, not by any mean saying men don’t do this, but it’s definitely more prominent in woman. I know 2 woman personally that have been in dangerous accidents with other cars because they were texting. 

Woman I believe don’t understand the basic functions of their cars. I’ve noticed a lot of woman do not use their blinkers when driving which I consider utterly toxic. They like to switch lanes without blinkers and than wave in thier mirror after they cut you off like they did nothing wrong. 

I could go on and on about this but I doubt anyone’s gonna read this. But I really do believe woman are a safety hazard on the road. Maybe an alternative would be a government school that woman take in addition to drivers ed so they can learn the proper driving etiquette.

143,"This is just a random rambling post and I wasn't sure where else to post it. 

Ok so I (20F) feel like I'm never going to be in  a relationship. And I feel like this stems from a lot of my own issues, also because I've never really seriously pursued a relationship.

firstly, I'm gay, which I've known since I was 14 and come from a religious background so I don't think any of my family would be accepting of it, and I don't really want to have to give up my family by coming out. i (because apart from this obviously I love them) And I don't want to have to put another woman through being in a secretive closeted relationship especially if she is out and proud. i honestly have no idea how they would react because when we see Lgbt+ people on TV they seem to kind of condemn it but then they also know some gay ppl at work, and don't seem to mind. But also I think they'd feel  really different if it was their own kid. I think my brother would be accepting though.   
This is just random but funnily enough I have a bunch of friends from school who are also gay, I came out before any of them (to the group of friends because I'm not really out to anyone else.) They've all been in relationships except me. I'm not trying to compare myself, but I kind of find that ironic. 

Also I have depression and anxiety. Not saying that people with those things can't be in relationships, millions probably are, but I feel like in my case I would never feel comfortable in a relationship and possibly ruin any kind of relationship by accident. 

Also I have had really bad body image issues since I was like 4 years old, I'm talking to the extent where I do not wear short sleeves or shorts outside ever since I was a literal toddler because it literally makes me want to curl up in a ball and die if people saw my arms or legs. Idk where this comes from, but I think it's partly because my family's religion (islam) teaches us we have to be modest, and I internalised that a lot growing up. (I consider myself to be agnostic). So I can't imagine like \*taking off clothes\* in front of someone else. 

This is also really angsty but I feel like no-one would really understand me enough to be in a relationship with me if that makes sense? I know we all feel like we're complicated nuanced people but other people manage to do it. There's been one person in my life who liked me, but he was a man and a new-ish friend, and I don't think he really knew me well enough to like me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Idk basically I'd been fine until now suppressing myself and stuff but I've recently been watching those like lesbian fan edits on YouTube where they portray all these beautiful and loving relationships to cheesy music and I've just been thinking aaah I really want that in my life.

146,"Many reasons. I'm such a weak person though, emotionally. I'm too disgusted by food right now. I feel like all the food is dirty, and I feel cleaner if I eat nothing. I can eat a tiny bit of packaged foods but I feel sick after. I'm hungry but very tired. I don't know why I suddenly feel this way. For the past 3 years my brain has done a drawn-out mutiny against me. I'm just losing everything.",18May2020,1
147,"I’m a guy so it’s obviously not a period, but every day I get agonizing cramps and there’s no real reason for it, i’ve tried googling it but everything that comes up is for periods, which i don’t have, cause i’m a guy. I’m also pretty physically fit and healthy so maybe it’s something genetic. Any ideas ?",18May2020,1
148,"I cut myself on my fore arm which I really regret as I usually cut in discreet places, obviously they will turn into scars but what can I do to prevent them being so visible? Such as using bio oil etc",18May2020,1
149,"Honestly I have just become smitten looking into people’s eye a bit more when engaging them at work whether they be co-workers or customers.

I have dreadful social anxiety most of the time which makes it hard to look people in the eye, but due to the times I’ve more or less been pushed to my deep end to socialize more when I get the opportunity to.

I love seeing that twinkle when people smile behind a mask or when they furrow their brow when confused. Or even when you get “the glare” from an annoyed customer has even made me realize more of a different perspective in some situations. (They can still be rather rude, but service industry be damned haha)

This might come off a bit too “Rose-colored glasses”, but it’s honestly something that has made me happier in these trying times and something I am going to really work on when these tough times are past us.

Have a great day and be safe out there! &lt;3",18May2020,1
