0,"Is it me or is looting like the black man's Achilles heel? Looting for black people is like landing on a snake in a game of Snakes and Ladders, only this snake has left them on a square which is 5 squares before the starting square! 

I'm being a bit crude here just to help me think out loud so don't be alarmed, but as soon as footage of a bunch of black guys robbing microwaves and XBox 360s from Argos starts doing the rounds on social media and the news, then no matter how cruel or unjust or plain wrong the initial incident was which sparked the outpouring of collective shock, anger and then solidarity, which by now had resonated sympathetic onlookers worldwide - it had all been for nothing, because some black youths were caught on camera making off with some white goods.

Don't get me wrong, taking anything which isn't yours is always wrong but it would be great if that also included black lives.

It's almost like the continued sight of watching goods being stolen from a shop hurts more than seeing black people's lives being stolen every day, despite the latter being physically more difficult to experience.

Once good quality footage of looting exists and is in the hands of the ruling party, ruling power, ruling ruler - it gets circulated relentlessly to blunt the fury and dilute down the spirits of those who had become incensed and inflamed watching George Floyd's life end like hadn't meant a thing. 

Once protests become violent and start attracting arsehole vandals, thieves and opportunists happy to hijack any cause to get some free shit, the zeal in moderate folk begins to wane, and the desire to see justice be done this time round (because it may be the last chance we get), gets downgraded in priority on today's 'to-do' list, until the flame that was burning so brightly for a brief moment is extinguished once again.

Apologies if this is upsetting you by the way, but you know what I'm like! üòÅ

But on a positive note, proportionally in mainstream news I don't see as many instances circulating whereby black protesters with integrity, staying true to why they are on the streets protesting, form barricades to prevent stores from being looted. Maybe if more videos of this kind were transmitted then it might encourage others to follow suit, because it's the kind of thing most people can agree is a good thing to see.

The protesters who are out risking their lives each day, who possess the integrity not be swayed away, but stay focused upon the cause for which they are fighting, for me, are next level human beings, whose courage I'm hoping can help reignite hope within people who might be feeling disillusioned, conflicted or just numb by all of the chaos happening in the world right now.

3,"I have a friend, more of an acquaintance really, who says she has a severe allergy to water. She says that she is allergic to the extent that her internal organs are affected, meaning she cannot drink water. She told me a story of when she was around 7 years old, and she was wandering around the house and she found a glass or bottle of water, and she took a sip of it, thinking it was something other than water. She ended up going into anaphylactic shock and into critical condition and it was only a huge dosage of adrenaline that saved her life.

She says she had a surgery on her stomach for unrelated reasons, and the surgeons had to improvise, because they never used any water based products during the surgery. She then says that after the surgery, she was given a saline drip to hydrate her, and she had a massive allergic reaction because the drip was just pure water with a bit of salt in it.

She says she can drink small amounts of milk and juice because the fats, carbohydrates, and sugars in the milk help the water molecules to ''sneak past'' her immune system, so when she drinks them, it doesn't cause much of a reaction.

I said being allergic to the actual water molecule itself and not to a contaminant is impossible and I told her I feel like she's lying and I told her you can be sent to prison for fraud. I told her ''your body is mostly water, so why aren't you in shock from your own blood going through your veins, or swallowing your spit since that is almost entirely water?''. She got very upset at me and said I wasn't a good friend and that I wasn't understanding so now I'm wondering if I came across as an asshole or not because I'm at loss and conflicted at the moment as to if she is lying about her condition.",03Jun2020,1

8,"To be honest this is me just needing to get it off my chest and vent a little.

&amp;#x200B;

With everything going on, and the death of George Floyd, the world (Or American in particular) has been going crazy and a lot is changing and happening. And subsequently, social media has been freaking out as well, where every time I check Instagram stories, its post after post on the same repeated posts from everyone. Heck, today was the whole blackout thing and whatnot. I have no problem with everyone else posting about, its their social media not mine. But, I don't post about politics on my Snapchat or Instagram, and I am consistent in that (Despite the Reddit name I was out of ideas and I occasionally engage in some political discussion on Reddit). Many seem to interpret that if you aren't posting about it, then you simply don't care and you're perpetuating the problem. But its far from the truth. I am troubled by what happened, and the protesters are pushing for something that is needed in the American Police system. I support their cause. But I still will not go and post story upon story about this. The main reason why, is because to me, it seems like virtue signaling, similar to the don't pray on the corner teaching. I support the cause and I support those impacted. But when I post and see posts about it, it seems a lot like a ""Hey I'm doing the correct thing, and if you're not you need to"". But with that said, you also don't have to be into politics to be deeply concerned with what happened. So it's this weird middle ground and its kind of a case by case. I don't like to project my political opinion online because other people don't really need to see it. If they are curious and wan't to know, then come ask. But posting online for everyone to see on personal social media, carries luggage, and so I just avoid that all together. I love discussion, and I have discussions with a few of my friends and we clash pretty often, but my Social media is not a place for me to espouse politics and opinions. Now I understand many will say its just support, and I understand, and again, its your social media and you may do as you please with it. But its also my social media, So I decide what to and to not post. I support the cause, but my social media doesn't have to be used for it. Maybe I'll go donate, maybe I'll do something else. But I don't post about politics, tragedies and whatnot on my personal social media.",03Jun2020,1

I genuinely wanted that deleted as well but they didn‚Äôt delete the original contact form with my equally important info.

The 2nd time I contacted them I replied to the original email a month later and I got a request received email. They replied within an hour of me requesting at 4pm and they replied at 5pm. 

They misunderstood and deleted all the data on the main site so this morning I messaged them again so I would receive a response the same day.

I didn't do anything when Philando Castile was murdered in front of his daughter for doing nothing. And even what I'm doing now seems like a weak response to all this.

Racist cops are a symptom of a disease, but not the disease. To solve this we have to end the prison-for-profit system, demilitarize the police, end the war on drugs, and more. None of those are easy tasks.

I'm going to consistently work toward doing those things from this points forward.

Meanwhile, police force are parading around doing unnecessary and extraneous activities with equipment that is grotesquely out of proportion with the public. Not that they've been doing a good job beforehand, with an abysmal record on bringing rapists to justice and a long track record of doing things any other person would be serving life in prison had they done the same.

It's time to commit to massive police layoffs. We need to reduce the police force by half. All pensions should be cut to zero. Retirement plans should be cut to bare bones. Salaries should be cut in half. Offices for the force should be reduced in space, and without amenities such as air conditioning or heat. Any place where unions prevent layoffs should have all officers laid off and officers elsewhere who are newly unemployed can compete for lower-paying jobs. In addition, we need to establish that all police equipment be made of a fund that, if left unspent, belongs as a bonus proportional to the officers, so that they think twice about using so much unnecessary and expensive weaponry.

When the dearth of taxes roll in next year and budget deficits pile up, watch as mayors, city council members, senators, representatives, and governors start talking about austerity in cutting major social programs for the poor, for schools, for critical infrastructure projects, and so on.

I am a white immigrant. I have next door neighbors that are black. I bank in the same bank as black people. I go to college with black people. I used to work in a hospital with black nurses and black doctors. I live in a city with black police officers, black firefighters. I know black entrepreneurs who are millionaires. I know of black billionaires. Black people can vote. I shop in the same stores as black people. There are black real estate agents, athletes, actors, musicians. There are black people who have nicer cars than me. There are black people who live in nicer homes than me. We just had a black president.

Note: This can‚Äôt be about the cop killings. I just looked up the statistic for killings that involve an excessive force investigation. 60% of these investigations involve white, and black officers killing black people. 40% involve white, and black officers killing white people. A little bit uneven but no reason to imply that white lives already matter and that black lives don‚Äôt?

Just today in California a black police officer was shot and killed by a protester. This movement can not possibly be about the shedding of innocent blood. Because it happens every day from all sides and this isn‚Äôt helping.

Even in the youtube comment sections.. they think that protesters are taking advantage of the situation to act like animals. This post is to just get things of my mind these past few days.. not sure if I put my thoughts correctly..


- Nobody signs a contract to be a protester. You don't wear certain clothes to be identified as one either as being a protester isn't a job with a uniform. You are strangers with the same goal uniting as one. That's why it's easy for people to mistake rioters and looters for protesters and see/portray protesters as the bad guys. Rioters and looters don't look different from protesters either. 


- Criminals still exists even during all this. So yes, they can and will take advanatge of this situation to loot, murder, and riot while the attention isn't on them. Criminals don't look different from protesters either. 


- This is a given, but not all cops are bad. They probably have family members who are protesting as well. 


- All of this shouldn't be used as an excuse to be racist against white people either. White people are individuals who just so happened to have the same skin color as the cops and the white people in power who screwed the people of color over. I am not responsible for someone's actions just because they have the same race/skin color as me. Same goes for everyone and the same goes for cops.

50,"This post is going to make me sound like a complete asshole, and, you wouldn't be completely wrong in thinking that. It used to be just a simple case of me being sad if I wasn't the best.

Nowadays, if I've been talking to someone for a while, and I either pick up on hints that I'm not the best, or if they just straight up tell me that they have a better friend, I instantly shut down completely. In most cases, this causes me to act like an immature asshole (although I usually hide my disappointment), and I start manipulating them, fucking with their head, trying to find a way to mentally hurt them before I ghost them. This happens in person and over text. It's rare, but sometimes I do just simply ghost them without any trouble. I feel at my worst when someone straight up says ""you're second"".

I feel like I can't control the way my brain just shuts down after hearing those words. I feel especially bad about it because in 2016, I had met probably the best person I will ever meet in my entire life, and quite frankly, she received possibly the worst manipulation I have ever pulled on someone, and I've been wanting to get better, but, well, I'm posting this in 2020, so...

The reason I'm posting this is, why am I like this? How can I change this thought process in my head? Why can I acknowledge (after the fact) that it's completely understandable that I'm not the best in someone's life, but I still act that way anyway?

51,"This is a long one, so get ready.

I was born to a doomed family, the only reason my parents got married was because my mum was pregnant. 6 months after I was born my mum tried to kill my dad with a lead pipe then ran away with me and disappeared with out telling anyone where she went. From here until I was 7, I have no record of existing, my mother changed my name and travelled around the country, she was junkie and ended up having 2 other kids while hiding with me, neither of them know they're real dad. When I turned 7 my mother moved back to the town I was born in so she could live off her parents. I lived with her, and my two younger siblings, I had to take care of them both, feeding them, cleaning them and making sure they didn't get hurt, all while trying to keep them safe from an abusive, junkie mother who used us to hide and collect her drugs for her. During these 7 years my dad had gotten married to another woman and had 2 other kids, they had split up but we're still close and he would have those two every weekend, little did anyone know that my mother had enrolled me into into the same school as the two kids my dad had with his second wife. The principal found it amusing how I happened to have the same last name as these two boys and brought it up with my father who was working as the schools groundskeeper at the time and he immediately came to find me. Of course at first I didn't know who he was, but the school had explained to me who he was and what happened, I went home later that day and told my mother who realised she couldn't run away this time because now the school was involved. So I started seeing my dad every day, and every single day I wished I could live with him, so he could take me away from my abusive mother. Over the next few months, my dad and my mum were talking and I was allowed to see him over weekends, which I meant I also got to meet my other brothers, and I loved every single second of it. One day, I decided I was leaving, I was going to live with my dad, I had only known him for a couple of months but being with him was infinitely better than being with her, so at midnight I packed my bags and used our home phone to call him, he was working so it took him a while to pick up but eventually he did, and when I told him what I wanted, he dropped everything and came straight for me, picked me up in the middle of the night and took me home. He immediately called the police to tell them what has happened, they said that they were fully aware of who my mother was and what kind of a person she was and told my dad to have a nice night and to get everything sorted quickly. It took 3 days for her to call my dad, he explained everything and she accused him of kidnapping me, but she couldn't do anything about. And that would be that last time I hear from her for years. About a year passes, I can't remember why but my dad hits me for the first time. It gradually gets worse, from being hit maybe once a month, to being beaten daily. Every single day for years he would beat me for the smallest of things, forgetting to do the dishes, spilling drinks, anything. Of course, I became depressed before even turning 10, and attempting suicide at 11. He never found out about that. All my school life I was bullied by both students and teachers (fuck Catholic schools), high school was terrible, not a day would go by where I wasnt beaten and teased, 2 more suicide attempts throughout. Eventually I decide school is no longer for me and I want an apprenticeship, after a few months of searching I find one, my dad is happy I finally have a job. I get everything sorted to drop out of school and start working, but the day before I drop out of school my dad decides he wants to move to a different city, without me, so he does. He keeps the apartment we were living in and let's me stay there, I have to pay all the rent and do all my own shopping and deal with all the bills, at 16 and with my first job. I was doing fine, I was making just enough money to support myself, then my dad calls me and says that he is no longer keeping the apartment and that I should move out before I get kicked out, at the same time I lose my job. So now I'm homeless with no money, I live on the streets for a few months until a friend of mine let's me stay at her place for a while. While I'm there I find a youth homeless program, I go check it out and they enrol me into their program, the get me a unit and teach me how to live on my own. I had my own unit for about 2 years in a shitty neighbour hood, but I was proud to have a home again. I end up getting a girlfriend as well, she is incredible supportive and has helped more than she knows and I love her with all my heart, we live together now in a house that she inherited. I don't know what my future holds but it can't be much worse right? Either way I'm happy with where i am in life now, I'm happy I didn't become the same people as my parents and I'm happy my suicide attempts failed. Every day I still regret leaving my younger brother and sister with my mother, who now lives in America somewhere and I am determined never to have kids in fear of becoming my parents and continuing the cycle, but I'm ok with my life now and how I turned out. I don't really know what the point of this was, I justed wanted to tell my story before I finish being a teen, thanks for reading.

I want to start a conversation with my friends and family, who I love dearly, about the state of our world: the unrest, the protests, the rioting and the looting, and what the hell we're supposed to do now that we've arrived where we are.

Because that's the problem at hand, right? What Do We Do?

I've seen a lot of different approaches to solving this problem of What To Do, and I'd like to talk with everyone that I love and care about, regarding an approach that I've seen come about that I feel is misguided. The premise of this approach to resolving the question of What To Do? relies on first answering the question of Who Is To Blame?

""Black people have been oppressed for centuries!"" &lt;==&gt; ""I didn't oppress you, I didn't own any slaves! I love black people, ask my friend Damien!"" &lt;==&gt; ""I can't get a job without education, my family come from a suppressed community with limited resources due to centuries of systemic oppression!"" &lt;==&gt; ""No one is stopping you from working your way up and putting yourself through college! This is America, just do the work and pay your dues like the rest of us and you can make it.""

Guys, we've been holding this discussion for years. And it is so important that we resolve this divide. But right now, for the time being, I want to propose a different approach.

Let's step back.

Think about how you resolve problems in your personal relationships. We all solve problems differently. Some of us are hot heads, some of us are doormats. Some of us bicker over anything and some of us will go above and beyond to keep the peace.

We all handle conflict differently, certainly. But I think we all have one thing in common.

Most of us have had times where we held a certain position against a friend or partner, and we determined that we were not going to back down no matter what. Can you think back to the last time you arrived at a hill you were willing to die on, and you were willing to dissolve your relationship with the other party if they did not concede?

I have an example. One time, I arrived at that hill where relationships die because the other party would not acknowledge that they were abusive. He said he wasn't abusive, that I was the one at fault, and I said the same of him.

What happens when relationships get to this point, so tense? Well, both parties have strong conviction in their heart regarding who is to blame, thus who is the victim, thus who should apologize to whom. Another important conviction is that each party believes that their grievance takes priority. But now it's at a breaking point. Two things can happen, as you can recognize as you think back on your past relationships. Some relationships dissolved - i.e., the issues that brought the relationship to this breaking point were not resolved. Some relationships stayed strong. The issues were resolved. How did they get resolved? Perhaps their were some apologies, perhaps one of you admitted that you were being a jerk. But here is where it starts: either you conceded that the other person's grievance takes priority, or they concede that your grievance takes priority. Yeah, maybe one of you shouldn't have yelled about how the other left the spaghetti out over night, and maybe the other one should have been more mindful and not waste food! But here's how the resolution starts: One person says, ""Hey, you're right, you don't deserve to be yelled at over spaghetti"", or the other person says, ""Hey, ya know, spaghetti shouldn't be wasted, that issue will not recur, and I'd rather put the spaghetti in the fridge in the future instead of ending my relationship with you.""

Right? How much does the blame game work for you, in your personal relationships?

And how well does it work, when your friend or loved one is there, standing on that hill that they're willing to die on, to lend credence to their grievances, and end the back-and-forth for the sake of the relationship?

Where their requests are reasonable, desirable, actionable, and not excessive, we give in, right? That's the type of person we want to be, typically, if we want to have long lasting relationships. We stop the blame game, we let it go. For the sake of our relationship with this special person, we acknowledge the priority of their grievance in comparison to our own.

So, with this picture in mind, let me get back to my point. I want to explain how I perceive all of the events unfolding around us.

We have a large portion of the population who are airing their grievances, and they have decided that this is the hill they are willing to die on. They are no longer willing to maintain the status quo of their relationship with society. Here is the grievance that they present to the rest of society: Black People Are Being Murdered By Police.

How are they expressing their deep discontent from this grievance? We've been watching it all play out. There have been thousands of people in the streets. Many protesting peacefully, some rioting, some looting. Are they handling their grievance the right way? Should they be handling it better, or differently? Are the Democrats planting rioters, to increase the tension, to make the people more angry, to make it all seem worse than it is, because it's really Not That Bad? Are the Republicans planting rioters, to make the demonstrators look bad, and to give the police reason to use excessive force? Why aren't they protesting peacefully? No no no no, why weren't the grievances acknowledged when peaceful demonstrations were made in the past?

Guys, we can go all day... We've done the blame game for so many years now. And until now, it has not solved the problem of What To Do. Can we please... try something else?

I've been glued to my screen for the last few days, and I've seen countless videos of the protests around us. I've noticed some incredible trends. The people are angry. They demand the violence to stop. I notice that when the police appear ready for a fight, the people appear ready for a fight. But... I've also seen the opposite occur. When the police take their hands off their weapons and do not assume the position of a dog in a fight, I've seen the people cheer. And I've seen police marching with the people, and praying with the people, and hugging the people.

Who should have conceded? The police, or the people?

Here is my problem with that question... That question of Who To Blame:

It is of no consequence to debate who should have conceded, because the people, simply put, will not concede. We are here. On that hill. And they demand that their grievances take priority.

So, before we just throw this relationship off the cliff -- let's evaluate a little more.

Are you in a position to lend them more grace and support? Are you able to consider, when you see the looting, and rioting, and you wonder when it will end, and what in the world has gotten into these people... that maybe we should let them have this one. Maybe we can just say, ""Yes, Black People Are Being Murdered By Police. I see that you are at your breaking point. The status quo is unacceptable. Let's do something about that. Right. Now."" I recognize that you don't agree with their manner of expressing their grievances. But let's put our grievances on a scale. On one side, we have: Black People Are Being Murdered By Police. On the other side, we have: Looting Is Unacceptable. Which one outweighs the other? Which one takes a higher priority?

Y'all, they're not even expecting an official apology letter from everyone in the opposing political party. They're not even saying that you, personally, need to apologize for the current state of affairs.

They want you to acknowledge that Black People Are Being Murdered By Police, and they want systems put in place for this to stop happening. Can we just... give them this one, y'all? Can you imagine how quickly this would end if the president would say something like, ""this is an incredible problem, and we have put together an agenda to start a national watchdog program which will be rolled out in the upcoming months.""

Like.... ???

Can we just respond to the grievance of ""Stop killing us"" with ""I totally agree, this is awful, let's figure this out to save our relationship"" instead of ""You need to respond differently when your close ones are murdered you have to live in that same fear""? Their demands are desirable, reasonable, actionable, and I simply do not see the downside in focusing on those demands and putting the rest aside for now.

Thoughts ...? I would love to talk with anyone about how they're processing everything. We've got to come together, it is literally the only way at this point.

58,"Since around December or so, my mom has been very secretive about what's on her phone. When it began, I didn't think much of it because I like my privacy too. But sometimes I would catch her talking on the phone in a hushed voice behind closed doors saying a man's name. Again, I didn't think much of it, thought it was just a friend because I trusted her. Then, around February, my mom and my dad had a massive argument and he accused her of cheating. She denied everything, and he threatened her with a divorce. They were fine a week later. It made me become wary of her, because although I trusted her, it made sense. 

Around March, they argued again. They were once again fine the week later. This time I grew suspicious. Whenever she was on the phone and I sat down next to her, she shut off her phone quickly so I couldn't see what she was doing. On her birthday, so in April, they argued again. They made up once more. By this point, I was fairly certain she was having an affair, but I didn't want to believe it, so I brushed it under the rug.

Yesterday, she was talking on the phone in our back yard. I was on my way to take out the trash, and I heard her conversation. She was talking about her relationship with this man, who had a wife too, and was talking about their affair, etc. I was horrified because I couldn't deny it anymore.

I understand why she's doing it. My dad is verbally abusive, can get physically abusive when drunk, does drugs, etc. I hate him too, I'm not surprised, but it makes me angry because I don't understand why they can't get a divorce and she won't have to have an affair. Everyone in this house is tired of their arguing, I don't understand why she can't be honest and has to lie to everyone and has to deny her affair when she wants to leave my dad anyway. It makes it worse for everyone else, because we have to listen to my dad come home late, drunk, accusing her and we have to hear them fight. I'm just tired of living in this house.",03Jun2020,1
60,"First off, I need to start off by saying everything that is currently happening is obviously very important, however, I think its normal and healthy to take a break from all these ongoing events. I'm from the US and I know we are hurting and everything going on is important but these types of things really need to stick to subs people want to fully discuss it. 

I had to unsub from a lot of subreddits like /r/nba, /r/gifs, /r/reactiongifs, or meme-type subs etc because I noticed a lot of the current events seeping into those subs. I know it's silly but I think being slammed with depressing content 24/7 just has not been good for my mental, I just need a time out from it. 

I'm really trying to take a break from all that is going on in the world. It would suck to go into a video game sub or a hobby sub and seeing discussions pop up when I'm trying to find my escape. 

If I really wanted to catch up with current events, I would go into subs like /r/worldnews, /politics, politicalhumor or  hell even /r/pics. I don't think that's a big ask and I know some subs and mods enforce this more than others.

61,"Hi again, it's me. &lt;His response, invariably, ""Hello, me!&gt;

Dad, you wouldn't believe this stuff. I still wish you'd been around longer than age 43, but I'm glad you didn't live this long. Watching your genius crumble would have broken me. But you having a late-life stroke or heart attack because of Donald Trump would have snapped my mind.

We're living through the pandemic of 1918, *again*. And the US is now the epicenter of the problem. Our science is moving toward a vaccine, and treatments, but National policy on combating the virus, and keeping the people safest, it *doesn't exist*. Nada, nothing. POTUS, well, he cray. Means ""crazy"", Dad. 

You couldn't have picked a better place to live during a pandemic than exactly where I am, about forty miles northwest of where each of us was born. Our governor, who will be POTUS one day, and the business, health, civic, and scientific people in the State, have done done yeoman work keeping the citizens safe, and providing for the sick and the poor. Not all States are so fortunate. The country essentially shut down. Yup, the whole shootin' match. Unbelievable. Over 100K dead, about half were preventable. The President. But he did nothing.

We have no natural immunity to this thing, Dad. This virus just *drops* people. From ""feeling poorly, some difficulty breathing"" to dead in twelve hours, *in the hospital, on a vent*, sometimes. All ages, but higher mortality among the aged, and black communities, as well as anyone with compromised immune, vascular, or respiratory systems, high blood pressure, it is terrible, and more than a little strange, diagnostically. I'll explain next letter.

And the President worries about reelection. Nothing else. You never saw anything like this guy. We thought Nixon was bad, right?  This guy makes makes Nixon look like Fred Rogers. He had a kids show on PBS. ""Mr. Rogers"" talked to them in a simpler, softer version of the way you taught me when I was very young. He had a whole neighborhood. You'd have respected him.

I never got to thank you for teaching me to love words, and books, and learning. Thank you for teaching me that Bill Russell is a man among men. And that Jim Brown was the greatest. I still think often of the Ebony magazines on the top of the magazine stacks on the living room coffee table. In a lilly-white town of 5000 souls, you wanted me familiar with black faces. I still remember the name of your black roommate in college. In 1951, right? Are you *sure* you started out as an Irish-Catholic boy from Dot Ave in Boston? I can hear you laughing.  

You were my inspiration to read everything, from ""Black Like Me"", by John Howard Griffin, ""Nigger"" by the great Dick Gregory, who used to ""warm up"" the Civil Rights marchers for Dr. King with amazing grace and the comic's sense of humor, ""Yes I Can"" by the indefatigable Sammy Davis, Jr., and ""The Fire Next Time"" by the gimlet-eyed James Baldwin. I mostly read stuff off the 'net now. Internet. It's...a series of tubes. No, I'll tell you how I use it in the next letter.

There are video cameras in phones now, Dad. Cellular phones. Portable. Global system. Satellites, thousands of them in orbit. No, really, really small. Shirt-pocket sized, about twice the surface area of a long filtered cigarette pack, and about one-third the thickness. Nope, not kidding. Hand-held computers. Yeah, hand-held, it's nuts.

A teen girl videoed the murder of a black man in broad daylight by a cop. Minnesota. George Floyd. Such a proud, handsome face, Dad. Four cops arrested a guy for suspicion of passing funny money. Then one of them cuffed him, put him on the ground, and knelt on his neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds. Yes, a man dying on camera at the hands (and knee) of a police officer, captured by an adolescent girl as people begged the cop to let him up. No, Daddy, don't watch it. It will just enrage you. And we're all working on controlling our rage these days. For numerous reasons, both political and societal.

And last night, the IMPOTUS, or IMPOSTUS, as you choose, sent *troops*, the equivalent against US citizens in Washington D.C. for a Photo op. No, it was the Guard, but actual Troops are on alert in the DC area. Aye, dangerous water, cold and swift, for sure. The Republic hangs by a thread, and I don't have a clue as to what to do about it. I don't know if the Constitution will be sufficient cover to get us to November 3rd. Yes, we're as safe as we're going to get, living here, and again, I thank you for that.

I'll send your love to your granddaughter, and you should know that just by having been such an awesome father, you give me story ideas. I'll tell you the one I have about her *other* protector, one with four legs, next letter. 

Wish me strength, and smarts, Dad. I know you gave me all I ever needed, there, but I don't feel so strong, lately. So if you could send me a ""42"", I sure would appreciate it. Please put it where I can't possibly miss it, because I'm a little scattered right now. Illigitimi non carborundum, Dad.

63,"I want to give an example that keeps crossing my mind that helps me put this into perspective for myself.

It comes from where I was raised. I was raised by relatively narcissistic manipulative controlling parents. The kind who thought it was funny to quote those passages in the Bible that say children who disrespect their parents oughta be killed. The kind who used to beat us by trying to spank us on the butt, but as they are hurting us we squirm and move screaming, so they get madder and yell that if they miss and leave marks and bruises elsewhere on your body then it was our fault, not theirs. What I'm saying is a person of authority over a child has *decided* that I am an awful human being and deserve some form of capital punishment as a result and any and all of their actions from there on forward are not their fault but mine, allowing them to go into a rage and forget that they are the authority, the adult in the room, the one who should be helping me understand what I supposedly did wrong, but instead they are merely focused on applying physical punishments in their blind rage. That is child abuse. **That is child abuse. THAT IS CHILD ABUSE!**

So let's relate this to police and the general attitude of those supporting police. You see some people say that people shouldn't be breaking curfews, they shouldn't be blocking roadways, they shouldn't be looting. It reminds me of laws allowing you to protect your homestead. There was a story a long time ago about a guy on some drugs in someone's house. They woke up and came to the kitchen and found the guy had broken into their fridge and taken some food and was eating at the table not threatening the homeowner in any way. The person was breaking a law, yes, but were they directly threatening the life of the homeowner? No, they weren't. Does the homeowner have a right to simply shoot the person in their house simply because they are existing in the wrong place? No, they don't.

There's this gag about Texas where so many homeowners wrongfully believe that if you are simply on their private property they are allowed to shoot and harm you, so you are taught to be extra careful to ensure you aren't accidentally on the wrong persons property in Texas. It's not true, but the rhetoric exists that people are so afraid of others and bloodthirsty that they WANT to believe they have the right to defend their property to the death even if there's no evidence of a threat. They don't want to think critically and say ""why is this person on my property?"" Maybe I should ask them or call the cops. No, many just want to reiterate their right to defend themselves.

So you get supporters of the police who say these horrible things. Well, you shouldn't have been protesting. You should have listened to their orders. You shouldn't have been looting. You should have dispersed.

There's a more common one you hear. People hear about the story and they immediately suggest the citizen attacked by the police must have done something wrong to deserve it. **WHY?!**

Relate that back to my childhood example so many of us experience. Can a child do something so wrong to justify physical beatings that scar them emotionally and leave marks on them physically? Is that okay? The big tough parent sure showed that child didn't they. Yeah they did. They feel like a big strong person beating that child into submission to get them to understand they did something wrong.

I sincerely hope you read the sarcasm there. The response of police is too much. It's unwarranted. It's abusive. It's akin to a parent beating their child because the child might have done something wrong.

* If your child is resisting your restraining them, does that give you a right to suffocate them?
* If your child broke something you own does that give you a right, to beat them with a stick?

Think through how ridiculous this is. Police have a responsibility to ease tensions, to protect and serve. Yes they have a responsibility to enforce the law, but god damn to what end? Why do they have a right to see that someone did something slightly wrong and they respond with such extreme measures as if their lives are threatened so much. Most of these cops are in big groups, wearing tons of body armor, they are trained more heavily to be a weapon than the average citizen, and they are constantly walking around carrying way more gear and weaponry for battle than any average citizen.

The fact that so many police seem incapable of simply communicating with people or peacefully restraining them without harming them comes of to me like some big 45 year old man brutally beating his 7 year old daughter into submission because apparently he's too stupid and incapable of realizing he already has such an upper hand the level of force used is completely unnecessary and inexcusable.

Most of these police responses are akin to child abuse in my eyes. There's a clear disproportionate level of readiness, and the big bad cop more equipped for any situation is going way overboard what they should and in nearly every case, they are wrong.

Let's pretend everyone protesting is wrong. Let's pretend they are all smashing windows and looting and breaking laws. Those of you who support the police using excessive force to the point of risking peoples lives are also suggesting that a child doing that much damage should just be killed. If you believe that, you're the problem. We are better than that. We have a justice system. We don't just ""take em out back and put a bullet in their head"" when we catch horrible criminals. We're better than that. We shouldn't be focused on catching every criminal and showing our big bad man force. We should be focused on ensuring the general safety and rights of the public are enforced.

But some people are overly focused on bloodshed, showing force, and beating and jailing anyone who might possibly break any law, they don't care about the narrative we're trying to discuss, they only care about ""beat them protesters and lock em up for a long time."" And to those people who think that way, you're un-American. You're wrong. You're divisive. You're inhuman scum. You're what's wrong here. Every time your child acts up, you just want to beat them into submission. It's just wrong.",03Jun2020,1
64,"So in my teens I used to emo, then goth and during that time I because super anorexic (weighing 90lbs / 40kg). After I finished highschool I because super lazy and becuase of that I started not carring how I looked. First I got back to eating and I put on so much weight (now I weigh 300lbs / 136kg), by 19 I was loosing my hair and had to shave it cause I was balding in the crown area, so to make up for not having long hair anymore I grew a beard. At this point I had stop wearing makeup and even got back to wearing glasses (haven't worn since I was 10). My clothes went from all black to mostly yellow (thats my favorite colour) and I now wear shorts and hawaiian shirts. Around age 20 I was fed up with the cold wear Melbourne, Australia had so I moved to Queensland, Australia because thats where my brother life and also the weather is hot 24/7 there (mind you teenage self hated the sun or summer). There I met my now husband Ben and 2 years ago we adopted a boy that we named Joshua (mind you my teenage self hated kids and never wanted one, after playing with my brother kids, they made me want a child of my own, but being gay I could only adopt)

Anyway, my country's (switzerland) discussing legalizing gay marriage and access to donated sperm for lesbian couples and I'm really angry that all I'm presented with are either leftist tree huggers or religious conservatives to pick a side from. As is the case with a lot of political debates in the west these days.

Over the years I've read a lot of opinions and experience pieces online and I've just now searched reddit for similar views as mine, shocked that they aren't more common. How exactly is it ok for a child to be specifically created because two people that biologically cannot have any now can? Who'd want to either have no available father from the get-go, be the product of more than two parents or have no contact to their biological father if they so desire? And who'd want their actual father to be a different person than the one that raised them? A mother and a ""gestation tank"" half-mother? 

Are all these people talking about ""anti-natalism"" and ""father's rights"" and ""access to sperm"" and ""right to have children"" honestly just not giving a shit about the psychological well-being of these children? I know *I* would've hated my parents for being the product of some franksteinish triple-parent experiment. And it's not like I'm ignorant of the science behind it, I hope for a future that lets us correct genetic diseases in embryos and all that. I just can't for the life of me figure out why so few seem to have a problem with producing, for all intents and purposes, children for ""unfit"" parents in a, yes I'm gonna say it, unnatural environment, that frankly I wouldn't know how to make sense of. 

""Oh but the biological father isn't *that* important"" - Shut up, you don't know how important mine is to *me*. How dare you construct an artificial reality for other children's lives. So if both of the couple are infertile, what do you get? A child with a sort-of mother, a sort-of other mother, a kind-of father another kind-of father? Do we realize what we're doing here? Are these lives we're creating just a commodity made to fulfil people's fantasies? Can we finally ask what a child with rights would want, not the adults?",03Jun2020,1

I switched roles recently and am even happier in the new position, but somehow still feel like nothing will ever be sufficient. I don‚Äôt know if this is a personal problem with envying others or just a self esteem issue but my problem lies in always thinking I need to be higher up, that other people my age are way ahead, and like I‚Äôm not making nearly enough money as I should be.

I can‚Äôt afford to move out yet with my salary. If only I made a little more. But I understand I‚Äôm not just entitled to a raise because of my age and degree.

I was not a good boyfriend in my first relationship, &amp; even though in the second one I tried. I loved her with all my heart, but it did not last sadly. We reconnected a bit after a year recently &amp; it seems she blamed everything on me. I do not blame her &amp; somewhat understand where she is coming from. The only person I felt who loved me unconditionally was my grandmother, who died two years back. I am 21 years old, in a university. I have tried to end my life multiple times, almost succeeded once. I am very interested in the meaning of life, I somewhat routinely workout, started yoga &amp; meditation recently. I do not have anything going on now in my life. Nothing good or bad.

I don't know why it always ends up with me wanting nothing to do with the person afterward but once it's clear I wasn't ever even a passing thought I guess I just want to give them the same treatment.


No, see, the moments left that are about me are for the few that still try to hold on for my sake. My buddy will finally get to watch the next season of Atlanta and probably wish I was there. My SO will be with someone new at a park or theater and laugh at a similar joke their new life partner will make before remembering she and I had been ""there"" before. My parents will probably think they failed (somehow even more so than they say Ive failed now) and it will haunt them every time they could've stopped and asked really what was wrong so they could finally say ""There. Fixed.""


I just can't anymore. I'm tired of working, getting up to sit around for 9 hours five days a week where Im disrespected, mentally drained, and all the while I am the closest in the office to the group of loud assholes who ride on our work. I don't make enough and I think on every day to what I can do to get out of this. None of my hobbies have taken off. I don't have the umph to do them for the few hours a day I have to myself to get them to a point where a passion (if you can call it that) leads me to a more bountiful life. I've given up and the universe is saying to let go and give in.


I will say, before I go, that society is facing a class issue. We're headed straight for black mirror, people. Racism is an ideology and you can't fight an idea without it growing in the minds of those watching. We can educate the current generation to educate the next generation that it's just wrong to hate. Systemic racism can be dealt with by replacing the system but that's such a huge feat to accomplish that we're all just hoping that all these angry people will just snap out of it. No, please look to who owns everything. Those people have been smart in an opportunistic way and have profited off society without giving enough back. It's plain and simple. We have a problem with overpopulation (and arguments to say we aren't are not accounting for it being an even bigger problem as time goes on) and this scales up the number of people who are uneducated in basic human decency. These uneducated people are the wild card. Some of them are looters, some of them are cops, some of them are in a positions of power over you. I know I'm missing steps here to rebuilding but it basically comes down to reaching out to your fellow humans and be kind. There's really no reason not to. Look in their bowl and give.",03Jun2020,1

Personally I have two relatives dead from it and my brother told me a coworker of his and his dad died from it too. Then where we were living just a few days ago there has been neighbors and construction workers from nearby buildings that had died too from the virus, word spreads quick.

In the next few weeks will the US not be looking at a huge resurgence of the virus due to the numbers gathering across the country in protest? In Ireland the whole country is going crazy because of two thousand BLM protestors that took to the streets a few days ago in protest. Our country has gone through a very hard two months of lockdown and are now gradually easing restrictions but monitoring new cases very carefully and large gatherings are banned for the foreseeable future. There is even a formal investigation into the organisers of the protest that happened the other day. It seems like all rules have been thrown out the window with regards to Covid in the US. Why does nobody seem to care now? Again I'm all for the cause but this could end up costing tens of thousands of lives.,03Jun2020,1

80,"Hey everyone! 

So I‚Äôm not entirely sure if there‚Äôs space for my voice in all this but I‚Äôve been thinking and want to chime in:

The Black Lives Matter movement and injustices faced by African-Americans (for centuries) is THE  ‚Äúelephant in the room‚Äù we can no longer ignore, something the last couple weeks has made so painfully obvious. We‚Äôve been witness to every gunshot, every knee to the neck, every sideways glance, all of it, through the lenses of technology. We‚Äôve captured the scope of the problem in it‚Äôs most horrific realities. I‚Äôve been overwhelmed and have been for a long time, and I‚Äôm sure many of you are feeling the same sentiments. 

We‚Äôve been able to view the minutiae of struggle in a way which has never been available to history, and that reality is a daunting prelude for what‚Äôs yet to come. It‚Äôs exhausting on a day-to-day scale. And in some ways, this movement carries a far greater weight in that it bears the souls from countless other injustices which never had a voice to be spoken. How many moments in history would the death of George Floyd have been swept away and forgotten as easily as yesterday? How many bodies were buried across the world before someone took notice?

I‚Äôm not sure about you, but I am fed up burying bodies in the dirt of our excuses.

So let‚Äôs talk about what we, together, want to work towards‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs a day coming, not so far away, when the descendants of our children‚Äôs children will wake to a sunrise of their own time. They‚Äôll get up, make breakfast, go to work, yawn and sigh, get frustrated, stub their toe, but more than anything, they will speak to one another. They will be the product of action just as our ancestors produced this generation from their experience. In that distant day, we‚Äôll be long-gone, the memory of a memory, footnote in the 42nd chapter from a textbook stored only in closets and classrooms. All that heat and passion we feel now will be dissolved into those pages. We have only the smallest of windows to write our story and only the essential of that story will be written.

What is the story we want to leave behind?

What is your story you‚Äôd leave behind?

Can we envision a sunrise where the word, ‚Äújustice,‚Äù is the living example of our respect for one another? Or will it become yet another word we attach at whim when the moment suits our distorted needs?

I‚Äôve been incredibly fortunate in my life to have walked through many cultures, heritages, and histories. I found my purpose in life during those moments, in the shared space of understanding, even in moments of disagreement. I found, far and wide, we are far more related in spirit than we think, and we are far closer than our screens would imply. Goodness is a language we all can speak.

Then, on top of that, there‚Äôs pain and suffering. Whether it be in Cambodia or Myanmar or Vietnam or Sri Lanka or in the United States, there will always be those who work towards their own selfish greed, hatred, and ignorance. There will be those who will tear down the bridges of understanding, and the actions taken by tyrants and fearful men throughout history will stay there. They can stay there, forever. It is only when we continue to lend our ears to their destructive words that their ideals are allowed to persevere. You can do your part, not with great, life-shattering changes, but in the way you say, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Every single moment of connection made in understanding is another defeat towards ignorance. I may never be able to comprehend the suffering felt in Cambodia during the occupation of the Khmer Rouge, but I can listen. I can learn. I can spread decency. I can spread understanding.

Our pain at home is the same pain as any of those across the ocean, we are one body and one spirit. I may have been born privileged but that birth does not require me to keep a blindfold over my eyes. The path without ignorance is a challenging one, and one that has never been surmounted at any time in history. We‚Äôve been dealt a tough hand in a future that has never been fully realized. It will take the everyday, minor interactions of us all to begin the healing. 

We may not win this goal in our lifetimes, we may not succeed entirely today, but what I can say, today, is that I am no longer complicit towards ignorance. I stand with George Floyd, I stand with Black Lives Matter, and I stand as an ally for those across the world without hope. Kindness matters.",03Jun2020,1

83,"  Im a 21 year old guy who‚Äôs normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‚Äòawwww‚Äô (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‚Äòhow‚Äôs your job search going‚Äô quietly and moodily. but when I Didn‚Äôt look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‚Äòohhhh....how did you apply for there then?‚Äô When Just before she‚Äôd give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‚Äòyou looking at her there?‚Äô in a smiley way, I didn‚Äôt Say anything. and  also said ‚Äòwe normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I‚Äôll just keep you with me‚Äô pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she‚Äôs referring me back to herself again and I didn‚Äôt want to but I said ‚Äòok thank you‚Äô and she just replied with ‚Äòsee you next week‚Äô.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I‚Äôm ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‚Äòwell done‚Äô and ‚Äòvery well done‚Äô a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I‚Äôm thick because I‚Äôm ugly imo  :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‚Äòand well done‚Äô as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‚Äòlet me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc‚Äô a lot more than once too.

85,"For the last 11 months, I've been an elected officer in the housing coop organization my house is a part of. It's a part time gig that pays exactly enough to cover the average rent in the org. Except it hasn't been so casual, and many months I made less than minimum wage if you look at how much time it actually was taking up. The organization is having a lot of problems so a lot of my time has been caught up in larger organizational bullshit instead of the focus of the office I was elected to.  Like, I'm supposed to run educational workshops and set up trainings, and I've been constantly dealing with conflicts that should be either handled by the houses or go to the board of directors instead. 

 I started only doing as much work as I was getting paid for a couple months back.  And literally every other officer position has quit since I started, but I stuck out my term. One of them is even suing us for not stopping harrassment from a member and for the excessive hours. Then elections for the new term hit, and I ended up running for both the office I had held, and the ""president"" position because we had really good people running for the job I had been doing, and someone I didn't have the same faith in as the only candidate for that spot, and figured the coop members would decide which job I got. And I lost both. 

This is awful for the organization, because now the only experienced officer is this guy who has his own agenda and is not about the changes we need to save the org, but great for me because it has been eating my fucking life since mid July,  and now I'm just going to step back, get some minimum wage work,  and make plans to move across country while this organization falls the fuck apart. 

I'm supposed to help run a  meeting in ten hours, but I've been insomnia drinking about the shit going down that's bigger than this since like Saturday when I got tear gassed for the first through 4th times, and my partner's kid got beat up by cops last night,  so fuck that meeting and this whole organization.",03Jun2020,1
86,"Background: I'm a member of a police department in a non-patrol/non-operational role focused on data and technology.

My city has seen multiple days of massive protests, which is unprecedented for our medium-sized city. The more hut-hut groups are leading the strategic planning of the riot control and specialized deployments.

Bottom line up front: This is a cluster fuck of racism, fear, and excitement.

Law enforcement is run by the high school drop outs and those who fill the more physical military-Esque roles move up quickly (SWAT, K9, Street Ops). The groups I work with like technical services, intelligence, and data analysis are the redheaded stepchildren. Hell, ""strategic planning"" has been taken on by folks who spent their careers doing drug raids and undercover work.

The cops working these protests are expressing joy out of this. I have never been so disgusted with my field. They came into the office Monday night and were sharing war stories about how they pelted innocent protestors with rubber bullets and fired tear gas into the groups. Not once did the protestors get violent or out of control; they were just standing in the street, and the officers decided it was time for them to leave. It is almost like they are living out their paramilitary fantasy on US citizens.

Please, be careful out there when protesting, if you are unarmed and peaceful - you are almost MORE likely to be the target of police violence. The police are being bullies and are taking joy out of this - do not let yourselves be an easy target.

I am going to quit. I can not take this anymore; for the first time in my career - I genuinely feel like I'm on the wrong side of history. I've gotten some decent technical skills that can be applied to the private sector, but it's been forever since I've had to look for a new job. Also, I need to get the hell out of the south, any job creators in the northeast US with available spots, please PM.

They are not there for me mentally or emotionally
I literally self isolate in my room. I live with a mom amd have a sister. Nobody in months has had a lengthly or deep talk with me about how i am doing, feeling, coping with a moving transition. nothing. How is my art portfolio going for a career i want to get into.I have no one care for me on a deep level.have a deep bond with.

I also found out my boyfriend(27m) (4 years together) purposely hid from me that we are not allowed to see eachother for however long corona virus and provincial lockdowns last.  months.
I just finished living with him for 8 months. We were in a different province then I'm in now. Hes going to school there.
Reasons specified as to why it was best for me to move out
1)He said he didnt want me to get sick- he recently got a job working in a elders home with covid-19 patients. Thats what he empasized the whole entire time. 
2)Also i was supposed to come back to this province to attempt to get a job in the career i want. I want to become a tattoo artist. Salons arent open yet, but i came back thinking theyll be open soom enough, and meantime i will finish up my portfolio. He finished school next year, and the plan was, get a apprenticeship now, complete it next year, and him finishing school next year and coming back.

He didn't tell me purposely that, if he gets in contact with anyone outside of his province, he has to leave work for two weeks.
he didn't mention this a single time. He just told me today.
He may not be able to see me for months...stupidly i thought to myself, if we had a chance at meeting up on his days off, we could. nope, because he has work concequence for that. He's also said he gets to get a corona virus test, but everytime ive asked him when hes getting it, he says he hasnt been told yet. I thought we could meet up if he wasnt tested as positive. I told him how i felt. He just said, its not that long, we cant control whats happening in the world right now, what is the point of you coming back if you can get sick... he will not talk me through things until he knows i am okay.

Things were abit different when we lived together. He cared alot, listened, and sometimes i was able to be deep etih him. I did feel he cares alot though.

 I'm hurt and want to run away from everybody I know. The pain I'm having. I can't sleep. 
 I don't know what it's like to have someone who looks out for me in everyway like i do for them. He hasn't asked how I'm doing. He doesn't know the hell im going through with being in a home with family and taking in how they treat me(they also judve the living shit out of me for alot if things and try to guilt trip me). Like hes been aware that its tough here, but I haven't shared with him truly my pain of how hard it is here truly. He doesn't ask how my day was or how im feeling. Its just random texts about, did you eat yet, or how his work is going, like non emotionally deep stuff.
We video chat a few times in the week bht igs not about personal stuff.

I want to be honest with myself, and him from now on. Not play into hiding my feelings and playing the 'im okay' front 24/7. 
Im very hurt emotionally,  he did this purposely.
I want to ignore him. Get away from him. Problem is, im addicted to him. I instantly message back. Want him. Desperate for him to care in ways i think are suitable although i dont show that.how do i stop that? I feel empty knowing he didnt want to see me as badly as i wanted to see him. I'm unwanted. Hes okay if we dont see eachother for months.

I want to be a normal human who doesn't need him so much.

Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and respond. Help in any way is appreciated.",03Jun2020,1
88,"Every pair of shoes I have ever owned has never lasted me more than 6 months. I have worn everything from $20 skate shoes from""Big 5 Sports"" to $100+ shoes from brand name outlets.

Both of us have come out of long term relationships and are wanting to get with other people as well. We have such an honest and open communication about it. As soon as one of us feels weird about it, we talk about it. We have no secrets and are able to say absolutely anything with no judgement from the other person. 

I'm amazed. I had been put off of sexual relationships with guys for what I thought was eternity and then this has popped up out of nowhere. I am so happy.

For this country to move forward we need to once and for all put the injustices committed against people of color, socially, judicially, and economically on full display.  

We need to open our minds and our hearts and accept that we are guilty regardless of whether we have actively or passively engaged in racism.

I asked a question the other day in a comment about the current situation how I as a white man can be more actively helpful than I have been in the past.

I was torn apart in the comments for even asking the question.  I never did get an answer.

But today I saw this article and feel like it was helpful for me in confronting where we really are and what I can do to help without accidentally overstepping any important boundaries.

105,"I have an upcoming series of exams in a few months that will determine my college life. I am incredibly stressed. I've been reviewing for 10 days but I'm already so drained. I realize how stupid I am for not even mastering majority of high school Math. All those medals I've earned doesn't mean anything if I don't even remember how to do basic arithmetic properly.

I am determined to really pass one of them because if I don't, I won't get in my dream school. I've always dreamt of that school. Always wanted to be part of it. But now my hopes are low. The recent results for last year's exams were released and I saw people who failed even though they got high marks. I'm doomed. I keep thinking that I will fail and every time I think about the next few months, I have to stop myself from crying.

I'm also stressing over the fact that I don't know what direction I want to take. I have to make a decision sooner or later, but I don't know what I want. 

I'm afraid of being a disappointment. Although none in my family pressures me to study a certain degree nor to go to a certain school, I hold myself to a high standard. I just know that some people will say things. I don't want that. I want to avoid that. But I know I'm the problem and it's making me mad at myself.

On top of reviewing, I'm also juggling a part-time job online. Dad got laid off because of Corona, mom is a SAHM. We rely on this money to feed ourselves in this pandemic. I've never been in a situation like this before and I keep thinking how I will not survive as an adult. Now I'm hesitating with my plans to move out by college. I don't have savings, it's been used up. I don't know what will happen now. My parents aren't kicking me out, I just wanted to come out of comfort zone a little bit. Guess that's not happening now.

I can't deal with the anxiety anymore, this shit anymore,

The world is falling apart, life has been in tatters for years

I'm tired of fighting to fix things, only for it to end in tears

Did everything right, never intentionally harmed a soul

Helped as many as I could and then some more

A strict compass of morals, which caused me plenty harm

Stuck to a 'code'

Only for things to fall apart, one after the other

Beyond my control

Is this a test? Or does the universe just hate me?

Worse still, what if there is nothing which oversees? 

Compass of morals and 'code'. Irrelevant.

Far too young to bear the burdens that I did

People have it worse, I know,

Each to his own, pain.

What it isn't, though, is helpful. It is addressing an effect. A symptom. It is saying ""You shouldn't do this, because I don't like it, and I don't like seeing it."" The fact is, everyone that says those things ignores the cause in lieu of the effect. Everyone that says those things is saying ""I'd rather treat the symptoms instead of the disease."" No one who says those things has even considered the WHY. WHY are people rioting? WHY are people protesting? WHY are people saying all cops are bad? Because there is a grave illness in America. Raw power without prescience. Authority without justice. I have heard ""I'm tired of seeing this."" almost constantly. You know what? Good. Me too. I am tired of seeing it just as much as you, and others are more sick of it than either of us.. But while many who say that just want to stop being aware of it, there are so many more that live it, and can't stop being aware of it, and they want to stop seeing it just as much as you. More than you. So much more. You're tired of seeing senseless death? Good. So is everyone. Except maybe, just maybe, quit saying you're tired of seeing it, and sweeping it under the rug, and start being tired of seeing it, and making it stop happening. Treat the disease, not the symptom. I really hesitated to say anything. I am a straight, white, male American, living in a country in which I will never have to face the possibility of being gunned down by accident or on purpose. I didn't do the blackout. I didn't do much of anything. I didn't believe, and still don't, that I can do jack for shit. But I am not going to sit here and watch a daily video of death or violence, and just be¬†*silent*. I don't know what I can do yet, as far as affecting change at this point, I really don't. It could be nothing, and it could be something I haven't thought of, yet. But I'll be good and God damned if I just ignore what is happening and accept it. So you angry protesters, get angrier. Rage. Riot. When they hit you, ask for more. Not because you can take it. Not because you haven't had enough. Because you are stronger than them. When they beat you, get up and look them in the eyes. Not because you are a threat. Because you deserve to be seen. And when your blood is on their fists, let them go to sleep tonight, and God willing, it will never wash off, so they can see what they have done in the morning, and let them live with that blood on their hands. If this offends you, if you think I am talking about you when I mention blood on hands, I have some bad fuckin' news for ya'.

We got taught a lot about racism (in my own country as well as in the USA) and police brutality. I have somewhat of an understanding about it, but that‚Äôs just what I learned in history class, where I‚Äôve seen and discussed many videos of police brutality against POC.

117,"One of the biggest mistakes I made, while only briefly, was allowing my white privilege and ignorance to blind me to the true meaning of Black Lives Matter.  When I first heard the expression, I agreed, but then I started to hear the All Lives Matter noise and started to fall for that ideology.  All lives do matter, why single out black lives?  Why isn‚Äôt there a Straight Parade, where is my recognition?  I feel like, as a middle-aged white male, society has programmed us to think like this and I fell right into the trap.

I honestly don‚Äôt remember who explained to me the difference and the meaning behind Black Lives Matter and Pride Parades and other similar movements but luckily, I was able to hear through all the noise.  This is how I understand things now and hopefully I am on the right track, if I am not, I am always willing to listen, learn and grow.  These movements are in response to the oppression and abuses these groups have dealt with their whole existences.  Black Lives Matter isn‚Äôt saying black lives are more important than other lives.  Black Lives Matter is bringing attention to the situation in which black lives are treated as less valuable than other lives.  To bring attention to the fact that people who look different, are treated different.  All Lives Matter isn‚Äôt relative as white lives aren‚Äôt treated with the same systematic racism as black lives are.  As a white male, I have never feared interactions with the police.  I have never been treated poorly or looked down upon because of the colour of my skin.  

White people are also blinded to the effects of white privilege because that is all we know.  We have benefited from white privilege our whole lives.  It is difficult for some to recognize this as they only know it as their normal, every day lives.  It is not something you have to remind people of, you don‚Äôt have a white membership card you have to show people to get the benefits, you wear that benefit from the day you are born to the day you die and it is with you no matter where you go.

I will never be able to understand how it feels to be treated as a person of colour or a LGBT person or other groups who experience hate, bigotry and discrimination for who they are because I have never been treated like them, not even for a day let alone a lifetime or lifetimes upon lifetimes. I cannot see the world through their eyes because my white coloured glasses has filtered out all those terrible things they experience daily.  

What I can do is apologize for myself.  I am sorry for ever saying anything hurtful to a person because that person was different than me.  I am sorry if someone said something hurtful to a person because that person was different from them and I did not speak up and say I will not tolerate it.  I can pledge to stand with those who are doing everything in their power to stand up for themselves and need me to stand with them.  I can pledge to call out others for their actions of hate and discrimination.  I can listen, learn and grow to be a better person.  Black Lives Matter.",03Jun2020,3
119,"I grew up in a racist home.

My mom and dad are both racist, it‚Äôs almost like being brainwashed. My mom thinks all muslims should die, even the children she believes that they are all evil and are terrorists. My dad preaches that hitler did gods work because the Jews killed Jesus.

When I was on a ferry around the age 12 their was a brown man with a backpack on board with me. I called my mom in tears because I was afraid that he was going to bomb the boat. 

In high school I befriended a girl who was muslim, my mother made me stop talking to her because she was ‚Äúdangerous to have as a friend.‚Äù I miss her, she was a great friend and we probably would still be friends now. 

I really liked a boy in high school who was darker skinned, my mom said if I ever married a man that was Muslim she would disown me and wouldn‚Äôt want anything todo with me. He wasn‚Äôt even Muslim, he was just black but being black means you are probably Muslim to my mom. I miss him too. 

I wanted to teach English in foreign countries with my boyfriend but my head was filled with stories about how I will be raped and Murdered. I wanted to travel right out of high school but my mom would always criticize it and tell me I‚Äôd just being asking to get raped and sold, their are no safe places to travel.  My mom has never left the island I have been born on, the furthest I‚Äôve been is Seattle.

Hitler isn‚Äôt so bad to my dad because ‚Äúthere was alot of Jews and they were taking over, they aren‚Äôt innocent.‚Äù

You don‚Äôt realize that you‚Äôre growing up in a racist home because it seems so normal. When you think of a racist home you think of something so different then what it actually can be. I didn‚Äôt think I grew up is racist home, I just thought my parents had strong opinions and that they were trying to keep me safe. 

I am not a racist and I never understood my parents ways I left home and made my own decisions, I‚Äôm not anymore afraid of coloured men then I am as white men. And yes men scare the shit out of me because they are capable of overpowering me.

I took a three month class on World War Two and the Holocaust just for I can defend Jewish people whenever my dad tries to praise fucking Satan aka Hitler. 

I‚Äôm moving off my island that‚Äôs been home for 21 years, the island that‚Äôs ‚Äúshielded me from rape and chaos.‚Äù 

This weekend I will support and defend my black community in a protest, because black lives fucking matter and this shouldn‚Äôt even be a thing. Black lives should not be taken by men/woman that hold authority. Or anyone one. Even if they could be Muslim (sorry mom, you fucking racist cow) 


You could be growing up in a racist home and not even know it. My advice? Educate yourself and treat everyone the same, if you suspect that your parents are racist they probably are.

120,"I just want to site a few of my experiences growing up in Texas in predominantly white school districts. 

1. 2nd grade I move to Texas from Puerto Rico. I am black. I do not know Spanish, but I am automatically placed in ESL without any approval. It‚Äôs not until 2 weeks later do my parents realize I‚Äôm not making friends. The school just assumed since I went to school in Puerto Rico I would know Spanish. Now I get placed in a class a few weeks into the year at a new school. 

2. I read for fun in grade school. My school has these tests and tell my parents that I can‚Äôt read AT ALL and need to be in special ed. My parents read with me every night, so that‚Äôs not true. My mom demands a retest and ta-da I‚Äôm reading ABOVE grade level. 

3. 5th grade, I‚Äôm a pretty nerdy girl. I‚Äôm shy and quiet. I‚Äôm the only black kid in my class. We have a sub and she comes in the class and calls roll. My name is French, but a black person is wearing it so it‚Äôs ghetto. But if you could read a map, you‚Äôd know how to say it. It‚Äôs not common like Marie, Desiree, or Manon. I correct her like I‚Äôve always been taught. And she puts me out in the hall for ‚Äúyelling‚Äù. All day. No recess. And the next day she calls my name incorrectly again and this time I don‚Äôt correct her. But I‚Äôm out in the hall again for ‚Äútalking‚Äù during role. 

4. My 5th grade teacher returns. We have a science fair. I partner with my best friend, Brooke. The teacher asks Brooke, ‚Äúare you sure you want to partner with her? She‚Äôs lazy and not as smart as you‚Äù Brooke tells me, of course. So the next day I take Brooke to my teacher‚Äôs desk and ask her if she indeed said that. Her face looked broken. My parents brought it to the administration and she was gone within a year. 

5. My 8th grade history...HISTORY teacher is upset her white son lost a track met to a rival schools black track star. She felt the need to tell the class it was unfair that her son even needed to compete against him because he has family genes that are used to RUNNING FROM LIONS IN JUNGLE. She taught students history going into high school. 

6. In 10th grade I had taken pre-ap and AP classes. I saw that AP was a scam and decided to take dual credit. I just needed a B or better to enroll and my current teacher‚Äôs approval. It was English. I averaged a pretty good grade so I brought the slip to my teachers early. All of a sudden I am bombing papers and exams. My mom studied English in college so she started helping me. She read the books with me and proof read my papers. I get my grade back it‚Äôs an F. My mom demands to speak with the teacher the principal and the administration. The teacher can‚Äôt explain her reason for her grading and all of my work is being re-evaluated by other teachers. I get my A and start taking college credit courses on English and History. I earn my college degree in History 6 years later. 

What‚Äôs worse, the students that were empowered by teachers like this, and learned in subtle ways that I‚Äôm less than or should be punished more harshly are our kids teachers now. My best friend Brooke is a teacher now in the same school district. They‚Äôre officers. That teacher‚Äôs son that couldn‚Äôt win a track meet is a cop in my hometown, who knows what that woman said at home. That 10th grade English teacher got an award last year. Teacher of the year. 

I just thought I‚Äôd share. It‚Äôs depressing and burdensome. It‚Äôs not always blatant in your face racism, just subtle ways of reinforcing stereotypes or supposed superiority. Something to think about when your kids come home with some racist ideas that I know no one on here would ever teach at home. Thanks for reading.",03Jun2020,5
121,"im 16 i was doing my homework and i had to choose 3 talents. didn't do it. it was so embarrassing only putting that i know composing songs and rapping, i asked to my mom ""mom what are some talents that i have?"" she didn't say nothing for 15 minutes because ""she didn't hear what i said""... she did listen to me, and was 15 minutes thinking what im good at, what she said? im good at computers, and thats it. i like to make people happy, and thats not a talent, i try to create the smile that i cant have in other people's faces, thats it. sorry if no one cares but i haven't told this to anyone, not my friends, not my mom, not my brothers, i don't have a dad so yeah... when my mom is mad she calls me ""piece of sh\*t"", and i don't say nothing because i agree with her, i'm not good at school, im not a good brother, im not a good student, i've never had a girlfriend for more than 5 months because they'll always get bored of me or they cheat on me. My mom thinks that a Psychiatrist is useless so yeah i cant talk this to anyone. I cry in my room like 1 or 2 times a week. i dont know what i will study, i dont know what i will do for a living, i only like making songs and listening to music while i think that i am really useless.

Last year I decided to have online friends again. Well you can see that it didn‚Äôt really do well for my mental health. 

Many encounters happened, some woman near my age nearby wanted to do weird shit, not going to the details. Some people my age did some shit with their friends. I never had a real friend, some even tried to meet me but they had plans.

127,"This is silly.

When I was younger people used to say ""hey look! She draws so we'll, She's gonna be an artist for sure!"" And asked me to draw things for them. It used to make me feel good because that was the one thing I could do that probably no one else could as well as me. I liked cartoons and used to say ""I'm gonna be an animator!"" And ""I know I'm not as good but I'm gonna keep trying!"". 

Through my school years people encouraged me to do art related stuff, or just drawings of whatever. Although I never actually took classes for it or had any training of any sort, they just cheer me like in a ""WOooOW, veeeery good!"" kinda way. I did a comic in highschool. Was very proud of it. It wasn't anything serious, just dumb shit my friends and I come up with to make a comic that would have everything we liked from our favorite cartoons and that way make the best comic in existence because we made it, but ultimately it was just to have something to create and share and do together for fun. I was very into anime and Ranma 1/2 so the aesthetic was similar. 

When I was about to choose a career I actually wanted something more technical, like robotics or something similar but I wasn't good at mathematics and some scared me away from it because of that. I was in a very bad place mentally, I had very bad depression, so I didn't really thought about this important decision and fluke it by just going into something I heard a classmate was going to take and it had something to do with drawing good, which was graphic design. 

Well, I took it. Of course I found a lot of people that were very good at drawing and I settled for being just average at it. Finished it, barely average grades. And then I didn't knew what to do. Never had to look for a job, where or what to do. Went back to the uni for advise and I found there a new teacher that was starting an animation studio. Of course I thought ""I have to work there! That's my chance to make something!"". He agreed. The first day I went to ""the studio"" I realized that it was more like an apartment with three computers where the living room should have been but I was still optimistic. 

I brought my drawings to the interview and my stupid comic just to show my interest on this. But when they saw them they said ""this is not really very good. Anime is not an actual technique. You should try to draw more American style. Like this"". 

I've actually never had good self esteem, not even the minimum required. On the surface I try to not let that show because I had this belief that the moment I showed any weakness people would just devour me and I would not be able to get back up again from the sadness, would not be able to think positive and fake it until you make it. Even though it sounds like I had good relationships with my classmates and my family I actually only had friends in those 3 years of highschool and never again or before, I actually don't have a relationship with my parents or my brother, and my normal companions are people way older than me if they care enough. I've had depression my entire life. And this very little thing that could have probably been kinda inconsequential, maybe some would have gotten angry about it or sad for a while and move on while getting some support from friends or family, this completely destroyed me. 

I actually tried a couple of times to draw as they told me and as they wanted to teach me but I couldn't, and then it hurt just to grab a pencil and I would start crying, I still can't do it 10 years later. I got mad at first but I think it actually hurt that bad because I realized that they were absolutely right. I took a look at my drawings and they were not good. But the worst part is that that was my absolute best and it still was painfully average, maybe even less than that.

I loved to draw. And I've been trying to get back to it several times, maybe with a different style, but I can't grab a pencil, or a pen or whatever for that purpose because I start crying. I can't watch tutorials to try to get better because I have to start all over and I cannot accept that I could have been this blind and this hopeful for my art. 

I specialized in 3D modeling but idk. I'm just so depressed in general and not necessarily specific to this that I can't feel any joy on anything I do, the not be able to draw is just one more thing among the issues I have but I actually thought that was going to be the thing i would do, if not as a job then at least as a hobby I could feel proud of, or at least have it as an escape where I could feel good about what I was doing.

136,"first, a little background: i live with my two grandparents and my mom in california. i grew up in very diverse schools and even as a young child i understood when racism was occurring. though the schools i went to were minority dominant, the town i‚Äôve grown up in is white majority. i myself am half white half mexican, but grew up whitewashed. 

   my grandparents and i have had countless disputes in the past when i‚Äôve tried to educate them about how the things they‚Äôre saying are hurtful, but of course they don‚Äôt listen. there have been times i was neglected for months just for telling them they‚Äôre wrong, and though that hurts, it hurts more knowing my classmates, friends, and people all around the world are living in fear because of people like them. 
   my mom understands the issues there are with racism, but there are still times i need to tell her what she‚Äôs saying or doing is racist. as of right now, it feels like she‚Äôs avoiding the conversations i want to have. i try to bring up what‚Äôs happening and all she has to say is that it‚Äôs horrible. i just don‚Äôt know what she specifically thinks is horrible. the racism? the riots? the vandalism? the looting? i don‚Äôt know. i want to be given more than something so vague. 
   for the past week, i‚Äôve been tuned in on the news and on social media. i see what‚Äôs being left out on the news, which is all older people are viewing. that leaves me to be the only one seeing what‚Äôs actually happening in this house. two days ago i overheard my grandfather talking to my grandmother about the protests. he (a republican white man) said if he sees any of the protestors around here he‚Äôs going to ‚Äúbring out the guns and shoot them.‚Äù i didn‚Äôt want to say anything at the time because it was my grandmother‚Äôs birthday and i tried to keep the peace for the day. however, yesterday he was on the phone with his brother saying it again. i waited until he ended the call and i asked him why he thinks it‚Äôs okay to shoot people. he already started screaming and cussing, saying he has ‚Äúthe right‚Äù to do whatever he wants. i told him he doesn‚Äôt have the right to kill innocent people for peacefully protesting, that it‚Äôs illegal. but anytime i have valid points he just tells me it‚Äôs none of my f***ing business and storms off. 
   i‚Äôm here to say i‚Äôm trying, and i‚Äôm trying really fucking hard to get through to them but it feels like i‚Äôm talking to a brick. there‚Äôs a protest i want to attend on saturday, but because of medical issues i have i‚Äôm afraid to be around so many people during a pandemic. i‚Äôm trying to let my voice be heard at home because it‚Äôs literally the least i can do right now, but every time i say anything they scream at me because nobody wants to admit they‚Äôre wrong. when i used to go to therapy, i would always talk about how progressive my thoughts are compared to theirs and how frustrating it is to hear the things they say. even in therapy i was told they ‚Äúgrew up in a different time.‚Äù who fucking cares. it‚Äôs obvious that the shit they thought was okay before isn‚Äôt okay now nor was it ever. 
   i don‚Äôt even know what to do anymore. it feels like i can talk to the whole world about these issues but in my own house i can‚Äôt. i want to see change and i want people to understand that the amount of suffering black people endure every single day is not alright. i don‚Äôt want to keep hearing my grandparents say ‚Äúall lives matter.‚Äù of course all lives matter, but until everybody is treated equally, we can‚Äôt deny the black lives matter movement. there‚Äôs so much more on my mind but everything is so jumbled, i just wanted to clear some of it out.",03Jun2020,1

138,"Hey. First post. Not sure where to start but here goes: for weeks I've noticed my roommates drifting away from me. They've only lived with me a couple months so I don't know them insanely well so I tried to let it go but it kept eating at me. I asked one of them today what the deal was. I told her I felt like I might as well not be around because no one really talks to me or they leave the area. I was so confused because there was no big fight or anything. She told me this is because I always take control of the conversation and I direct the topics towards myself or what I want to talk about. She also said that I spring intense questions on them a lot (like the one that started our conversation.)

I'm not kidding when I was surprised. I always knew I was loud and not everyone's cup of tea, but I've never been told this. But then a second later it made sense. I have always had so much trouble making friends, ever since I was a little kid. I truly didn't understand how to start a conversation with someone. I still don't. That's why I ask questions out of nowhere because I truly don't know when the best time is to ask them.

She is right. I am loud and firm in my statements. I can easily direct a conversation in whatever direction I choose and then I don't fully listen, sometimes even talking over people a bit. Please believe me when I say I don't realize I'm doing this. I am loud because everyone in my family talks like that. It's also the same reason I kind of talk over people because growing up (mostly on my mom's side) that's how we talked. I thought it meant you were showing interest. I truly didn't realize when I was doing it that I was making people feel unheard.

So. I am very worried. Because I have somehow never noticed this issue on my own and it has in fact caused me to lose so many friendships. My roommate is the first one to explicitly tell me this, and because of that I am grateful, but it doesn't change the fact that I have lost so many friends for this. I don't know if my roommate even wants to be friends with me either. I'm scared of being alone again. I'm scared I won't be able to change. 

Most of all, I'm scared I'll become as bad as my mother. She was like this, only far worse. If I can't change I'll end up just like her. A family pariah and failed artist whose liver failed at 49 yrs old.",03Jun2020,1
139,"Hi all! 
So I‚Äôve recently released my first music video, called ‚ÄòUse me‚Äô. It deals with bulimia, my abusive relationship, struggling to conform to the increasing pressures of society, drugs, mental health and fun things like that.
I was formerly a high fashion model, which massively fucked me up, and I suffered with anorexia and then bulimia. I later bought my way out of my contract as I recognised I was no longer willing to, quite literally, change myself for other people.
At the same time, I was in an incredibly toxic relationship which also completely fucked me up. I kept trying to leave. I tried and I tried and I tried. And then one day I was sick and tired of being sick and tired and I upped and left.
In this video, I am portrayed as all the people that the modelling industry / my ex wanted me to be. 
Ultimately, it‚Äôs about empowerment and leaving toxic shit behind.
My mental health is far better than it was. I am diagnosed bipolar 2, and thanks to medication, early therapy and good people, I am able to manage myself far better than I used to. I wanted to die, now I want to live.
Anyway! Let me know your thoughts!
All the best,

Emma

145,"People tend not to make the connection between Mitch McConnell blocking additional pandemic/unemployment relief (with 10s of millions unemployed) to the riots in the streets.

If the social contract is so obviously broken and we're not all in this together, then why not start rioting/looting?  

Why not be a little more lax about social distancing?

If a society treats its people with extreme indifference and contempt, it's to be expected that they'll often return the favor.

There should be a lot more pressure on Moscow Mitch and the Senate GOP than on your average police officer right now for the lack of pandemic/unemployment relief alone.

But the lack of pandemic/unemployment relief is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the absolute contempt that people are treated with in this country/society and have been treated for decades.

We don't have universal healthcare and get price gouged mercilessly, meaning tens of thousands of people needlessly die and go bankrupt every year in America while we waste hundreds of billions of dollars annually.  GoFundMe healthcare should not be acceptable in America in the 21st century.

But American lives don't matter.

There's no real effort to end mass incarceration or the racist and inhumane drug war.  

But American lives don't matter.

The standard work week hasn't decreased in 80 years, since 1940, despite phenomenal economic and technological progress since then. Think about the scale of theft and the enormous scale of wasted human life that represents.  

But American lives don't matter.

Wealth inequality is obscene and US life expectancy is declining as people die deaths of despair.  People are treated as ""human capital stock"" instead of human beings.  

But American lives don't matter.

So, fuck it, I guess. There is no social contract. 

People will usually treat their society in the same way that they are treated, which in America is with *absolute contempt and indifference.*

Because American lives don't matter. 

And in America, black lives can matter even less than the average person's.  

If the rules of society dictate that people's lives don't matter, then people will behave as though society's rules don't matter either.",03Jun2020,1
148,"This isn‚Äôt something I think about very often as it was years ago, but with the BLM movement at the moment and Twitter cancel culture I‚Äôve now had a huge spike of anxiety related to the issue.

Back story is that years ago, I must have been 16/17 (I‚Äôm 22 now) I sent a really fucking stupid photo to my friends with a really racist caption. I know it might not sound genuine, but I wasn‚Äôt, and am still not racist. I jus started to notice that a lot of my friends found racist jokes like that funny and I sort of did it to fit in, I had absolutely no negative feelings towards black people, and as a fellow POC myself, I understand the injustices we can all go through.

Back when this happened, I thought nothing of it, but as time has gone on people have become more and more anti-racist, which is 100% the correct thing to do and I‚Äôm glad. But seeing cancel culture on Twitter ruin all these teenagers lives for saying racist stuff makes me feel two things. Glad, as racist people are getting real life consequences for stuff they‚Äôve done, but also really bad, as these are literally just dumb fucking kids saying shitty stuff not understanding the consequences and meaning of what they‚Äôre saying.

I definitely believe they need to be punished, but some of these kids are having college pull applications and effectively their life is over, it‚Äôs justified, but also questionable I guess. Because I was once there, I was a dumb fucking asshole that wanted to make my friends laugh with a racist photo, and now I‚Äôm much older and have matured a lot more and see the error of my ‚Äújoke‚Äù and the damage it can cause, as little as it is. 

I‚Äôve actively been anti-racist since then, following movements such as BLM and such. But absolutely NOTHING makes me forget that stupid decision I made back when I was 16/17 years old. A couple friends screenshot it and occasionally bring it up as a joke which kind of pisses me off as it shows me they haven‚Äôt forgotten and still have the proof. 

I trust my friends, and I know they wouldn‚Äôt leak that out to ruin my life - but what if they did.

Seeing cancel culture on twitter gives me incredible anxiety and paranoia now, I feel like I‚Äôm waiting for impending doom, one morning I‚Äôll just wake up and finding out all my info has been leaked because of something stupid I did 5 years ago, me never being able to find a job as when you search my name THATS what you‚Äôll find, my future dream career over, my gaming being harassed etc.

Was what I said wrong? Absolutely. 
Am I justified? Definitely not. 
Have I bettered myself? Yes.

I‚Äôm just incredibly paranoid that this will one day bite me in the ass and ruin my future. I occasionally have mild suicidal thoughts about it, I don‚Äôt know if I could live like that knowing my life is destroyed. 

And this isn‚Äôt for anyone to feel sorry for me or pity for me, I just needed to voice this out and get some advice - especially from someone black, so please if you are commenting could you make it clear that you are.

I apologise for what I‚Äôve done and I 100% don‚Äôt expect forgiveness, I just need advice.

Thank you all.

149,"i‚Äôve always wanted to feel love, embrace it and cherish it but i never could. 

at times i was grateful but most of the time, i remember being bitter. i‚Äôve blamed my mother and the rest of my family for countless years of trauma. sometimes i was objective, as i should be but most times i was bitter. 

i was the guy that gets his arm bitten off by an alligator and lives the rest of his life in despair, disbelief, discontent. all while my parallel universe entity is living life, with one arm, knowing that his situation was neither good nor bad‚Äîjust an unfortunate series of events. 

i‚Äôd bullshit myself, act like i was the best of everything for one reason. my emotions. it is entertaining to state that i have a huge ego. 

yes, i‚Äôm not afraid to admit it is fragile at times and others can rattle me up. i assure you that i‚Äôm not a sociopath or anything...

but, i enjoy feeling as if i‚Äôm in a movie because it creates happiness. it‚Äôs exciting as hell to change everyday because consistency is boring. 

stoic philosophy has helped a bunch. understanding intense emotion could quite literally, destroy someone. i‚Äôve come to realize that my number one enemy is myself. that happiness itself is not to be sought after, rather i must be content with my own life. 

for those of you who don‚Äôt know. happiness is like having sex, smoking weed or sleeping in. that intense feeling you get when you do something out of pleasure and not because it‚Äôs good for you. 

being content is the feeling you get when you sit down on your couch after a long day at work. right after that 5 mile run. when you‚Äôre done studying for 12 hours straight. 

being content is feeling comfortable and safe because you know you are growing. that all of the hard work is unnoticed in the short term but will realize it self in the long term. 

being happy is temporary but feeling content is permanent. i‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt indulge in a vice or seek happiness. just know that you won‚Äôt feel fulfilled for long so don‚Äôt get your hopes up for anything more. 

everything in life is a struggle. a constant change and if you‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôll choose feeling content every-time. everyone can feel happy, it is easy to be emotional if that‚Äôs what you wish. 

however, the real challenge is playing the long term game. suffering through discomfort. looking for contentment within yourself.

Hello to anyone who reads this, so just about 2 weeks ago my grandfather whom was 102 years old passed away. It was very sudden and tragic for my family as he was in a nursing home and we weren‚Äôt able to be there for this final moment. 

This will be the first time we celebrate Father‚Äôs Day without him - my dad is one of those tough guys who doesn‚Äôt let their guard down to show emotion. But this recent passing of my grandfather has really effected him. I was wondering if anyone would be interested in helping me make this year not so sad for him. 

I wanted to get cards from people all over just reminding him that things do get better and that my grandfather is in a better place. You don‚Äôt have to say a lot in the card just small and from your heart.

I know that‚Äôs asking for a lot but if anyone is interested then message me please.",03Jun2020,1
151,"So for the last year, I‚Äôve been vaping and recently bought THC Oil from KingPen. Well ever since I bought it, I done nothing but vape it for a week straight and recently began to notice some weight loss. 
That‚Äôs quite strange for me considering I‚Äôve been trying to loose weight for the last 2 years, but ever since smoking this THC, I‚Äôve had the mega munchies so surely I‚Äôd gain weight rather than loose it, right?
Over the last 2 days, I‚Äôve lost a total of 3-4lbs. 
Is this normal after vaping THC for a week?",03Jun2020,1

154,"Male aged 30) 6ft tall) 161lbs)

In 2018 I was pretty slim but my face was smaller sized in proportion to it and it made me feel and look better so it must be the way I‚Äôm supposed to be.

Since last November my face looks larger and rounder and my body has gotten a bit bigger too with the skinny fat vibe Iv got going on even tho I‚Äôm still pretty slim with a pot belly. My legs at e long and skinny too. I jog in my garden back and forth until I sweat and out of breath rinse and repeat. Will that help? Iv lost 5 lbs and it‚Äôs made a slight difference 


Thing is I get stared at coz I‚Äôm skinny as is which makes me very self conscious and have an eating disorder:/",03Jun2020,1
155,"I‚Äôm one of the million Americans on unemployment. Being a non essential person an all. And I receive my unemployment via debit card, from BOA. A bank is a bank unless you live in a city were there is no BOA. In witch case you have to pay a fee. If you want to withdraw money other then the ‚Äúup to 100 cash back deal. So let‚Äôs say out of the 29 million on unemployment 5 million are in the same boat. The fee here is 4 dollars. Being just a guesstimate banks make 80 million a month just giving you your own money, with one transaction a week. Witch is probably more since every atm I‚Äôve been to there was a limit amount per transaction. Even my own bank who I pay a monthly fee. So that they can use my money to make money. Corporate America. Where everyone gets a piece of you at least once. So they can live the life everyone else only gets to dream. Without even a thank you",03Jun2020,1
156,"So. I‚Äôm in my twenties. I‚Äôm very introverted. I don‚Äôt go outside most of the time and I live with my parents. They never complain about me (at least now that I know of). We have a nice relationship and I have younger sister who I‚Äôm very close with (she‚Äôs 12). I haven‚Äôt kept in touch with anyone from school, it‚Äôs been years. I don‚Äôt really miss my friends from there but I in large didn‚Äôt talk to anyone else outside my friend group back then. Still have next to no social life. Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm upset... I know my life is kind of in the shitter rn anyway but still. A week ago my parents start talking to this guy I went to school with. I don‚Äôt remember talking with him ever and he was a grade or two above me. He works at a place they were shopping at. He tells them he‚Äôd always had a crush on me and even asked me to prom. Now I don‚Äôt remember this happening but it might‚Äôve? The guy says he‚Äôll come over to see my parents project (bc he sold them stuff at his job for this project). Omg. He is here right now! Even after my mom swore she got creepy vibes~ from him and would tell him to stay away. What do you say to a guy that does this? I don‚Äôt think he came over to see the project like he supposedly is and I‚Äôm annoyed with my dad for saying it was ever ok for him to come over. I find it weird af he supposedly had a crush on me bc we never talked. Not once that I remember. It‚Äôs almost too weird that he‚Äôd want to visit where I live too... Idk. I feel like my boundaries are being crossed! I‚Äôm just sitting in my room rn with my lights off, waiting for him to leave lmao. I can hear my parents and him talking and laughing outside my window ): I don‚Äôt want to bother anyone irl with this, so have this post reddit. Also, I know I need a social life but preferably not like this!",03Jun2020,1
157,"I want to continue collecting prints from artists as I think prints are beautiful and it‚Äôs a great way to support individual artists, but I have no idea how to display them or put them to good use. 
I don‚Äôt want to put them on my wall unless there‚Äôs a creative way to do it and I feel like putting them into a binder is boring....
Please help! Any ideas are appreciated!!",03Jun2020,1
158,"I'm 18 years old, homeless, and autistic. I recently got accepted into community college, and I've been confirmed a voucher. I just have to keep going until I get a house, but it's really really hard. The death of George Floyd has filled my city with protest, and I respect it, but it stresses me out so much. Last night someone banged on the shelter window during a riot and I had a panic attack. My mother said she hopes I become the next George Floyd. I'm only here because I got kicked out of a different college for talking about wanting to commit suicide. I just want a hug so bad, so so bad.",03Jun2020,1
160,"A few years ago, I tried to use a $100 bill at a department store.  I generally don't carry cash but I know someone who insists on paying people back in hundreds and I needed to get some new clothes, so I figured I might as well get rid of this bill while I'm at it.  

The clerk at the register refused to take the bill and accused me of trying to pass a counterfeit.  She called her manager, who ran a marker over part of it and said that was somehow proof it was counterfeit, and then she called store security who grilled me over why I was trying to pay with a counterfeit bill.  I was deeply ashamed, and ended up paying with a credit card and leaving the store.

I sat in my car for a while, furious at what had just happened, furious at how ashamed and humiliated and powerless I felt.  When I reined in my emotions (don't drive angry), I drove to a nearby bank.

The bank teller listened to my story, and agreed to verify the authenticity of the bill.  It was real.  She said that nobody at that store must have ever seen money before, and broke the bill into twenties for me (because twenties are easier to use).  I thanked her, and returned to the store.

I brought in my recent purchase and the receipt, and returned it to a different clerk and a different manager.  I had decided that this store did not deserve my money, and I would shop elsewhere.  

I try not to think about that day-- I don't like dwelling on feelings of powerlessness-- but something in the news reminded me of my experience.  Another person had also tried to make a purchase with a bill that the clerk didn't believe was real.  There are really only three differences in my story to his:

1. He had a $20, I had a $100.
2. He's black, I'm not.
3. When I sat in my car, I wasn't murdered by cops.

Although I guess #3 makes #2 obvious.",03Jun2020,1
