45,"Hey Reddit! I wanted to share some things that I can't really share with family or friends, I don't like sharing things anymore and I don't know how, but I wanted to let someone know!

The past few months have been greatly difficult because of a bad breakup and health issues. I wanted to let someone know that after all the mental health concerns and health problems I'm doing well!

For my mental health, I'm doing great compared to as before. Some mornings can be tough but that's okay, it's part of life and in the long run I only see this as a strengthening run. With my physical health, I have some chronic pain and I thought I was at a dead end with everything, but I've gotten in touch with a neurologist and I'm going for more tests to diagnose a pinched nerve. I've got a 2 CT Scans, Bone Scan, and MRI; I've had them before and they're exciting because of the technicians you can meet. They're always exciting and it's fun to study yourself in a way.

I am a little nervous though, not because of the tests really, but because after some relationship issues I don't feel comfortable sharing things with anyone anymore. I've heard therapists say that's bad; and I believe them. I just don't know how to share it you know, or with whom. With family yes, but how? If you have any advice or comments to give I'm open to them all

Anyway, have a great day!",02May2020,1

I want to reopen what we closed so clumsily and for it not to be a mistake.

I want to be The New Me, the one born from the experiences you gave me, the one who does not fear vulnerability.

72,"I don't know how to explain this properly without rambling. 

I struggle with depression and have struggled for my whole life even though I'm still young. I one point I guess I stopped thinking about the 'future me' as my depression consumed me whole. I was in a really bad place, and there was only two paths in my mind. I was either going to kill my mother or kill myself. There wasn't an alternative at the time and I never thought there was going to be anything else. 

At the point I was even on a web forum for people who hated their mothers. I remember reading this one post about a guy who would put things in his mother's drink...but I feared my mother more than anything so offing myself was the path I was going down. To me...at the time many years ago, how I felt was that would be the biggest f-you to the person I could never argue against. I was in pain constantly, bulled at school and worse at home, things weren't gray they were black and grainy and I was wearing down. I never made a concrete plan mind you. I didn't have anything set out it was more like the storm of the century on the horizon. I didn't know how bad it was going to be or how it was going to end but when the storm finally got here there would be no turning back. I just...I guess I had this feeling deep within my bones that I wasn't going to come out of it. I wouldn't become an adult. It was like a fact, like it's 52 degrees outside and I won't last much longer. 

But then I was rescued. I was saved, and I got help. I got hella lot of medication and therapy. I got a therapist and a psychiatrist know! 

I just...didn't think I was going to be here this long. And sometimes I feel like I'm wasting the life that was saved every time I have lull moments in life. I feel like a piece of me is missing to make me like everyone else. I don't know. When people first get saved I feel like they would do everything to make life meaningful but after sooo many years you run out of meaningful things to do. You can't do something productive every second of every day.

It was like a fact, like it's 52 degrees outside and I won't last much longer. 

But then I was rescued. I was saved, and I got help. I got hella lot of medication and therapy. I got a therapist and a psychiatrist know! 

I just...didn't think I was going to be here this long. And sometimes I feel like I'm wasting the life that was saved every time I have lull moments in life. I feel like a piece of me is missing to make me like everyone else. I don't know. When people first get saved I feel like they would do everything to make life meaningful but after sooo many years you run out of meaningful things to do. You can't do something productive every second of every day. 

I'm not sure how I feel. 

I don't want to go anymore though. At least that is my new fact.",02May2020,1

83,"TW/CW: mentions of s*icide and self h*rm.










I (f16) have been feeling suicidal and more hopeless since I started school in August. I have felt depressed and anxious since 12/13, and I have never gotten help or been diagnosed with anything. My family isn’t abusive, just shitty. They make me feel terrible and they think they are normal and perfect. Almost all of my problems are caused by them. For example, I can’t eat without feeling guilt or feeling watched, because my family constantly reminds me that I need to ‘’calm down’’. PS: I’m overweight. My sister, who is four years older than me, has been told by a therapist that she may have adhd. I basically had to grow up with an undiagnosed adhd sister, who has controlled me, and gotten all the attention, just because she was the loudest. I shouldn’t talk about my family this detailed, but I want you all to understand that talking to my family about my problems isn’t easy, because they caused it. I can’t go outside without feeling watched. I feel physically unwell at school (headaches, tummyaches, can’t breathe etc) because of how stressed, anxious and uncomfortable I am. I know I need to take responsibility about my mental health and weight but I truly believe that there is something wrong with me. I don’t want to lose weight out of SPITE. I don’t want my family to think that bullying me is how they can make them get their way. No, no, no. I do well at school, I’m a smart kid I think, I don’t get in a lot of trouble, but when it comes to my weight, my biggest insecurity, I’m stubborn and rebellious. 
Anyways, maybe two weeks ago my mom told me that I couldn’t eat bacon and I started to cry and run to my bedroom. I was crazy. I told her that she and my sister had ruined me, that I can’t even eat in public without feeling fear, that I do not know what I look like. She told me she would call to my doctor that would transer me to a therapist. Because of corona, I have to go to the doctors appointment wayyy later. My mom thinks it’s fine, because I only told her 10% of my problems, which was about eating and my body image. The issue is that I’m suicidal. It’s not like I’m going to yeet myself out of a window when I get the chance to, I just don’t wanna live when I know I can’t function properly. I’m ruined. I keep wanting to cut myself. I have never thought about self harm until I became suicidal and saw posts and comments where people joked around and related to other teens who had scars. They were in this special club. They had proven to themselves and to others that they were unwell. I needed to do that. I want to feel something. I hate pain but it’s something else than emptiness and suicidal thoughts. I wanna relate to other teens who have the same issues as me. It sounds sick as fuck. I have realized that I am sensitive to subjects about suicide and self harm so I try to stay away from it online. But those razor blades in the sealed packaging. I tried to hide them. I threw them behind the bathroom shelf, but I found them again. Not so deep cuts = proving to myself that I have issues and that I don’t have to pretend to be fine, and relating to the others with the same problems as me. Very deep cuts = I don’t have to live anymore. Please help me get these thoughts out of my head. This post is a mess but it’s 03:28 am here and I’m an emotional wreck. I can’t tell my mom about being suicidal. She talks shit about people she knows with some of the issues that I have myself. I need to stay strong until I get to therapy, but how?



tldr: because of corona, i have to wait until i go to therapy. i feel suicidal and depressed but my family doesnt know that, only that i have self image issues and eating problems. idk how to keep fighting until i get to therapy, please help.",02May2020,1

88,"Heard that this subreddit can give some nice advice to people struggling with their lives, so I guess I might try. I'm an 18-year-old high school student who can't necessarily be considered a popular kid, I'm quite overweight ,not to the point where I can't walk but quite rotund, double chin yada yada yada.., got some hairs growing in awkward places such as a unibrow and a patchy teenage beard, basically enough for 0 people to find me attractive, all my friends seemed to have gone through a glowup and now looking like your typical 10/10 tiktok stars while im left there looking like trash.

I've also never been what people may call stylish, always wearing off-brand clothes and just regular sports shoes, and it didn't really bother me up until last year, it seems as if everyone suddenly became fashion geniuses at school, wearing expensive streetwear items and having dozens of pairs of expensive basketball and skating sneakers, which makes me look not only extremely pathetic, but also like a homeless person whos just found some off-brand trousers on someone's porch.

the last nail in my social life's coffin would probably be the fact that I'm starting to figure out that I like one of my guy friends, and as a guy who's never had feelings for another man it all comes with a constant rush of emotions that I feel like is going to drive me insane. It has been going on for some time, about 9 or 10 months, started with me and the guy just throwing some of the casual 'gay jokes' every group of guys has, then suddenly understanding that I like that person and that it's way beyond just 'being gay with the homie' for me but not being able to get a word out because of low self-confidence that's fueled by all the reasons I've written here.

What's even worse is that he's probably not even into me, I've been throwing some clues here and there but haven't had the courage to just straight up tell him... He's probably a straight guy who's never going to love a man in his life, making my life even more miserable. I'm honestly so tired of this situation and am so hopeless at this point I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to feel alive again, just like back in the day...

95,"I have a huge crush on my friend. It's been going on for two years now. A few months ago I finally had the guts to confess how I felt and she didn't feel the same way. I kind of knew all along that she didn't like me back, and I thought that hearing a ""no"" from her would have allowed my feelings to subside. I thought I would have been able to move on. Unfortunately that hasn't been the case at all. I still really like her despite knowing that she has no feelings for me whatsoever. 

Not only that, but I feel like I have an unhealthy obsession with her. I get upset when I feel like she isn't giving me attention and sometimes feel jealous when she talks to other guys or mentions other guys in conversation. In order to try and combat this, I told her that I needed a break (she was cool and understanding about it), however it's been almost a month since I've spoken to her and I still really like her. It's been super difficult not talking to her and it makes me feel depressed. I've been trying to meet other girls on dating apps, and I'm even talking to a different girl now and it's going pretty well. However, I still think about my friend constantly and fantasize how life would be if she was my girlfriend. I keep holding out hope that one day she'll change her mind even though I know realistically that will never happen. 

It's kind of out of control and I worry that something bad will happen if this continues. I worry that she'll get a boyfriend and it will destroy me. I worry that she'll get tired of me (I feel as though I'm too clingy with her) and she won't want to be my friend anymore. I worry that my feelings are too much for her to handle.

I struggle with depression and have struggled for my whole life even though I'm still young. I one point I guess I stopped thinking about the 'future me' as my depression consumed me whole.

There wasn't an alternative at the time and I never thought there was going to be anything else.

At the point I was even on a web forum for people who hated their mothers. I remember reading this one post about a guy who would put things in his mother's drink...but I feared my mother more than anything so offing myself was the path I was going down. To me...at the time many years ago, how I felt was that would be the biggest f-you to the person I could never argue against. I was in pain constantly, bulled at school and worse at home, things weren't gray they were black and grainy and I was wearing down. I never made a concrete plan mind you.

100,"May 1st. 

Prepare for long musings while my brain fog is at bay.  😂

I would like to make friends with other women in my age group who are single and never had kids. I feel quite alone as a single and childless 26 year old among most women I know who are married and have babies or are pregnant. It's all I ever see and hear about now. I wouldn't say I am jealous but I do get feelings of alienation and indifference because well, I can't relate to any of them. I feel like an alien woman. I also think when women hear I am single and childless they judge me right off the bat as immature or selfish.

It'd be refreshing to talk to other women who are older who have walked the path I am on. I just want to connect with other females because it seems I get along with males better. I think it is because I feel more comfortable being myself around guys because I feel they aren't as socially judgmental and clique-ish as women can be. 

Not saying ALL women or mothers are judgmental but I find that most of the women I meet are judging of women who choose not to have kids because ""it's what women do"" and ""how dare you not love babies?!""

All of the women I knew growing up have now become mothers and it can be all they talk about and post about on social media. I feel like I just can't relate to any of them so it's harder to make friends with them. Even at work I can't escape it. My boss was excited when my co-worker found out she was pregnant and then I had to listen to the whole ""you have to have a baby sometime, too you know? You need to meet somebody before it's too late!"" talk. I just laugh and nod. What else am I suppose to say?  

Somewhere deep down inside me, I **would** like to experience what it would be like to grow a life within and then give birth. Even though I know it would hurt and possibly kill me (I have chronic illness and heart issues) I wonder if it truly is a miraculous experience filled to the brim with happy feelings and endless oxytocin.  I sometimes daydream about snuggling with my imaginary newborn next to my imaginary husband in our bed and just soaking in the wonderful feelings. I bet it is wonderful.

But the diapers, puke, snot, tantrums, diarrhea blowouts, no sleep, being judged for not feeding my kids an all organic diet or \*gasp\* **choosing** to formula feed (how dare I?!)--are the things I *don't* want. I don't want to be judged for the choices I make as a mom any more than I already do as a woman. I don't want to lose my identity and ruin any closeness I would have had with my husband. I don't want to seek attention on social media all day because I feel trapped at home with no one to talk to except my kid. I don't want to not be able to work anymore (I can't believe I said that). I don't want to feel trapped and like I am not *me* anymore. And I don't want to touch bodily fluids. 

I guess that does make me selfish and immature. But immature enough to know my limits on my mental health and come to grips with what I can and cannot handle. I just wish I could meet other women who feel like me. Women who feel afraid to admit this stuff in fears she will be judged and cast off her womanhood. Women who fear telling others how she really feels without worrying about being criticized. Maybe I should be the one who comes out and says, ""I'm here--I know how you feel. We're not the norm but we're not alone.""

Gosh I don't know. I have been really wanting to write a book about compilations of my self-introspections and deep thoughts about social stuff and life as an awkward ding-dong weirdo. Like make a book for people who are like me, telling them they are not alone or weird.

I'm young, early twenties. Undeniably successful in my career, making more money than I ever dreamed at this age. I'm in a happy relationship, going on about a year and a half.

All of this and I feel so empty. I have many hobbies that come and go. Things that I considered ""passions"" but I can never stick with. Music, videogames, books, cars, disc golf, programming, pentesting, livestreaming -- all things that I consider passions and hobbies, but none that I feel inclined to dedicate my life to. On weekends when I'm looking for something to dedicate my time to, I can never make up my mind and everything feels like a waste of time.

I want to feel like I'm making a valuable contribution to the world. I haven't found the thing that motivates me in life. I have no goals at all. In the past I've been motivated by my career, to make more money, but decades earlier than expected I've reached a point where I'm making enough to be happy for the rest of my career.

I'm far from suicidal, but when I think about my purpose for existing on this planet I come up blank. What is tomorrow going to bring that yesterday did not?

I just come back to dating apps because I honestly just don't get to go out that much and I always hear of people meeting up on them. I also understand that dating itself is a numbers game. The more people you approach the more likely you are to meet someone that likes you. The thing about online dating is that you get rejected SO MUCH that it just gets to you. Also it keeps a log of everyone who ghosted you. I've read that girls are just way more picky online as well. I can see that being true because I was going through one of my friends tinders with her and alot of the swipe rights were a match. Not every swipe but her matches for sure dwarfed mine. I think you have this situation where  everyone is trying to talk to the most attractive people on the app while the most attractive people just talk amongst themselves or go out with a bunch of people. Leaving the majority to not really find anyone. I don't know any of my guy friends who have gone on a date from a dating app. 

I think this really says something profound about how the internet was imagined to work versus how it has come to work. I think in the beginning the internet was suppose to act as a format for decentralized information but with the rise of huge social media aggregators what we see is actually more easily controlled information. Dating apps were supposed to allow people to meet people that they would like but wouldn't have much of a chance of meeting in real life, but in actuality reduces self confidence and the chance of actually meeting anybody for most people.",02May2020,1

117,"Ok maybe I care enough to be curious about my feelings. I'm a woman in my twenties... Married to a man in his thirties. When it comes to sex we are very compatible, and he likes to entertain the idea of ""sharing"" me with both men and or women. But I'm not into the idea of having sex with anyone besides him so we just role-play it or entertain the idea for him.

He's the only one I've ever been with. He's the first and only real relationship I've ever had. I've been on dates before but nothing ever came out of them and I've only been on dates with men.

But ever since I was a young girl... Like 4th or 5th grade... I've had crushes on girls (and boys too). Like my heart would beat fast when my female crush was near and felt all tongue tied when I had to speak to them. As an adult I feel like women are in general more attractive than men.

But I grew up in a strict, religious background and therefore never had the guts to pursue anything like the idea of maybe dating someone from the same gender. Once I drew two girls kissing, my mother found out and it was one of the worst experience ever in my life. I lied and told her I drew for a classmate and that I wasn't interested in that... She kept interrogating me to ask who it was but I just told her someone from class... Not a friend.

I sometimes wonder what it would be like to have gone on a date with a girl. I had a chance but a friend ""cockblocked"". Anyways just wanted to get it out there because I don't have anyone to say this too irl. I don't want to experiment or anything.

131,"I'm a man from Italy. 30 years old. I'm a only child and most likely will be left alone when my parents die. I am very afraid of solitude and loneliness. I would do anything to have a loved one in my life after my parents die but there simply will be no one. Life alone scares the hell out of me. I am very afraid of going through everything alone, what if I catch an illness? It's true I have cousins but I can't rely 100%on them, they have their lives,and most importantly I don't want to be a burden on anybody. There is nothing left for me but going in a nursing home after having applied for disability. I suffer from schizoaffective disorder. I will live my life with 500 euro all my life and will barely afford anything. But my life doesn't make any sense. I repeat: I would do anything to escape loneliness. I am so fucking scared of living alone that living in a nursing home would be a better choice for me. I have bought 1 kg sodium nitrite but I'm scared I will get tumors.

133,"It would be worth mentioning my dad is a narcissist.

I find myself crazed for attention, I even do musical theatre. Which I feel like most people in that field have some kind of need for attention, escape or whatever it may be. I’ve been doing professional productions since I was 14/15 ish. I find myself so in need of compliments and attention I’ve been in numerous relationships where my s/o was possessive and overly jealous. It’s confusing for me, because when most people picture that kind of person they picture someone loud and extraverted but I’m neither. Especially when first meeting someone, I tend to keep to myself and panic when I’m spoken to. 

It’s also bizarre I find myself getting VERY insecure, regarding my physical appearance and personality and then the next day I’ll be like “holy shit i’m HOT.” and hold myself in high regard. But no matter which side I lay in, I have this insatiable hunger for attention and validation. 

I have been trying to get better, mainly over text I’ll watch out for how many times I say “I.” Or make a point to engage the other person. Obviously I’m not bothered to do that on reddit because this entire post is me talking about me.

134,"I'm laying in bed browsing reddit and I feel something landing on my right shoulder. I assumed it was a cloth moth or a tiny black beetle because I have seen a few so far this season. So I look over while moving and it is a spider hanging there by a single web. So I position myself away from it and start looking for something to kill it with.

It lands on my big dufflebag pillow and stays there so I grab my small round mirror and press it down on it to semi-squash it and hold it in place so I can better kill it without mashing it into my pillow (yuck). 

So I hold the mirror down with one hand and reach for a piece of newspaper. Lift the mirror and the spider is balled up like it was dead. I try to use the edge of the newspaper to scoop the spider on it and it wigs out and scrambles off and lands on my bed. Then stays still. So I put the newspaper in my hand and scoop-grab it crushing it in my hand to make sure it is dead. Then, add more news paper to encompass the other newspaper and squish it tightly to make sure it is definitely dead and trapped. Then I threw it away.

141,"  

Fourteen years ago, I became a teacher but forwent that career because it almost took my life. 

My then-girlfriend, now wife, had been sitting in a diner enjoying a cheesesteak (me) and a pork-roll and cheese sandwich (her) when my phone interrupted the meal. No one ever really called us, so we were both surprised to have gotten a phone call at 5:00 PM on a Friday. Nonetheless, I answered the phone and was greeted by a man who identified himself as the principal of a high school on the other side of the country. “Listen, I’m sorry I hadn’t gotten back to you sooner, but our phone lines were down due to a severe thunderstorm—were you serious about wanting to come out here?” 

I had been living in a top-rated region for education in our country; however, getting a teaching job there had been next to impossible as the pay for teaching was correspondingly highly rated. The best I had gotten was a long-term maternity leave substitute teaching position, but other than that I had been hard-up for landing my first contracted teaching job. To boot, school districts in the region had a bad habit of hiring new teachers for one year only to have them unrenewed for a second year in order to maintain a workforce of the lowest salary-ranged personnel. This, crossed with the exorbitant price of living in the region, fueled my seeking employment in another region that wasn’t really known for anything except being the desert region. My wife had her parents already living in the region and they had said that they were always looking for teachers out there. I had blanketed the region in applications, mostly online, but there were a couple of mail-ins. The principal who had called me had been from one of the latter. 

He was surprised to have a teacher wanting to leave where I was, given the region’s pedagogical accolades, but my having received all of my education in the same esteemed region, made my candidacy sought-after in the lower-rated region. In the end, the principal had told me, with my cheesesteak still warm on my plate, that he would have his human resources contact me in the morning to begin the hiring process. 

No interview, just an application, and a phone call, and I went from being a starving teacher to a contracted one. Two weeks and a three-day car ride later, and I had started my first year as a high school English teacher.

Now, like a newspaper reporter starting in the obituaries section, this first HS had me teaching freshman English. Granted, I ended up teaching ninth-grade for the majority of my career by choice, but the grade level was often looked down upon, especially by the teachers who tended to feel that their literary mastery would be wasted on such young students. Regardless, I immediately fell in love with the job, and I was happy to finally be able to do it.

In my brief two years at this school, I had become the head of eleventh grade English curriculum and development (yes, I also taught juniors) and had been nudged to be the same class’ advisor for student council. Despite these outstanding perks, the one caveat was that the high school had been in an affluent area, and with my salary being incredibly low, I had to drive almost an hour and a half to afford a suitable place to live several towns over. I just simply could not afford it.

With tears in my eyes, embracing my wife on the couch, I came to the realization that I would have to leave the job in favor of a school closer to home. It was tough, and as is always true in hindsight, I wish that I hadn’t had left, but the disparity between teacher pay and the price of living had simply been far too great. The principal and other peers were sad to see me go, but their support by way of letters of recommendation and professional references made my securing my second teaching position…in middle school. Yes, not a high school, but it had still been early in my career, and with my having been licensed to teach seventh to twelfth grades, I figured I should see if I liked working with the youngest of my clientele before committing to the older adolescents. It ultimately had been my first and last stint in a middle school as it had also included my first of what would become many negative experiences as a teacher.",02May2020,1

Count your blessings, not your troubles,

Within you are so many answers.
Understand, have courage, be strong.

Don’t put limits on yourself.
Your dreams are waiting to be realized.

Don’t leave your important decisions to chance.
Reach for your peak, your goal, and your prize.

The longer a problem is carried, the heavier it gets.

Don’t take things too seriously.
Live a life of serenity, not a life of regrets.

Remember that a little love goes a long way.
Remember that a lot goes forever.

Remember that friendship is a wise investment,
Life’s treasures are people… together.

Have health and hope and happiness.

I came up with an idea to create a book with interviews with ""ordinary"" people - with representatives of different generations, nations, orientations, with different views, who are not ""famous"" - just ordinary, average people, that you could pass by on the street, make friends in a pub; with people, who are struggling with the problems of today's world on a daily basis. I have a certain idea (an outline/a sketch) and I don't want to create something that would be a „remedy” for ubiquitous problems, but I’d like people to be able to reach for this book to read something unidealized, to see that they are not alone with many problems, to identify themselves with a given hero (I would like there to be ~20 guests in the book) - to get a materialized particle of someone's life in a standardized edition.

Something's happening to my legs and I have done every Google search possible to try to figure out what is going on. Basically, they hurt. They just hurt. It reminds me of growing pains a little but worse and it's my whole leg. It kind of feels like throbbing pain, but only when I'm being still. Three days ago it started on my lower right leg, then it got higher, then it moved to my left leg. Both of them are hurting now, all the time since three days ago. Yesterday it almost felt like it was moving up into my hips. 

It gets worse at night, maybe because I'm still? I haven't slept very well at all because I've been awake from it. It seems to calm down when I lay super still, but that takes a while and it's hard to be still that long, especially because I have to lay flat on my back with my legs straight. It's not extremely severe pain, but at night it makes me cry because it just *won't go away* and I desperately want to sleep. 

My mom said something about sciatica, but I've read about that and it doesn't sound like it, to me at least. 

This has happened once before, over a month ago. That time it was a very dull ache and it only lasted like a day or two and it was gone. It also didn't bother me at night at all because it was very mild. 

Just for the record, I'm a 20 year old female, I am overweight (but I am working on getting healthy), and I'm not very active. I'm also on my period right now and I thought that had a connection but the last time I wasn't, so I guess it doesn't matter.

I'm 22, 5ft7, study Economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), and live in central London.

As far as my personality is concerned, my female friends have always said that I'm quite cute, charming, loving and affectionate, so I'm hoping that's your cup of tea! I have always been quite sociable and popular throughout my life, but deep down (although no one in person would ever be able to tell!), I am fairly shy and introverted. I'm quite fun and enjoyable to talk to, however, so I'm sure we'd get on just fine! :)

In terms of my interests, I thoroughly enjoy reading books on philosophy, history, and economics, as well as non-fiction and detective fiction. I also like travelling (lived in 9 different countries till date owing to my dad's job!), discussing politics, following all kinds of sport (especially cricket, football, tennis, chess and badminton), spending absolute hours on good old YouTube, doing loads of window-shopping (I've always had a habit of trying on *reeeally* nice clothes, but hardly ever purchasing them!), playing the piano, listening to a lot of music (primarily EDM, classical, and folk), going on lovely long walks, watching plenty of documentaries and films (mainly comedy and romance), cuddling, and so much more...

I enjoy trying out and doing a wide variety of things, so I can almost guarantee that I would have great fun doing a hobby of yours that is not mentioned in the list above! Just try me! ;)

As bad as this year was turning out to be, it took a few days to roll it back to another avenue. I didn't think this day would come so early. I definitely was working on it for a while, auditioning and trying my luck out. And of all the times, this day had to come when I'm possibly at my lowest.

I've mixed feelings about this totally. Of everything going on for the past few years, I subtly know, life is totally unpredictable. You won't know where it takes you. It would come to you at your most unexpected moments and make a difference for a lifetime. It breaks you, teaches you and lifts you.

Life is a rollercoaster, eh?",02May2020,1
179,But you get that deep depressing feeling pulling you down because you know that you won’t be seeing your friends anymore as you go to different paths and places and at some point yall won’t have that same connection anymore. So during the last few days of the school year you’re just depressed and crying bout it but you can’t tell anyone coz they’ll think you’re a psycho...,02May2020,1
182,"Today my sister invited me to go on a picnic with her. I didn’t want to, but eventually I did. Honestly guys, it was great. I have five siblings, and we haven’t spent much time together lately. Two of my siblings, my older brother and sister couldn’t make it, but my other two sisters and my younger brother were there. We some sandwiches and chips, and played some uno and duck duck goose. It was a lot of fun: Me and my sisters talked a lot, just about random stuff. I guess my point is that even though having to stay at home for so long has been tough, it’s also been pretty great. I’ve caught up with my siblings, and today was just a really nice day to spend outside. Stay close to your family everyone, and make sure to take this time to talk to them if you haven’t in a while. I hope you all have a great day.",02May2020,1

190,"Ever since this started I feel much worse. Before this I never really exercised out side of PE in school. I regret that.

193,"I've been subjected to narcissistic abuse from my father, since birth, and my ex for 8 years. I've become so accustomed to saying ""yes"" to everybody. I've turned into the boss of people pleasers. The only person I don't please is typing this. I will ruin my day to make yours better, then I'll hate myself for it.

My aunt is my landlord and she lives close by on private property. She needs into my garden from time to time to use some storage space, use the back garden tap, (which rings through the entire house and is on for hours at a time). Sometimes I walk out the shower and she's just in my back garden. Sometimes she actually just parks her car in my back garden. I would also like to say I pay my rent and a fortune in bills/utilities.

Today she asked if she could use my back garden to grow some tomatoes, garlic etc. She said she'd need in every day and it would only be once or twice a day, but for weeks/months to come. She asked, but then went onto say she had already begun. Making it more difficult for me to say no.

But I did say the ""N"" word. I said, ""I've had a think and if I'm being honest I dont feel okay with this. If it's going to be everyday, for a while to come, I feel it's a little invasive. Theres coming and going in the garden already, but I value my privacy and would like maintain a certain level. Sorry to spoil it but I hope you understand"".

I'm already being hit with a ton of anxiety and I'm too nervous to even look at her reply just now, but for once, in a long time, I risked not pleasing someone else to please myself. 

I'm still being hit with anxiety thats saying, ""What will she think? She won't be happy. You should have just said ""yeah no problem"". Now look what you've done"", but in my gut, right next to the anxiety, I have a little proud feeling. For saying something that was really difficult for me and for being true to myself. Thanks for reading.",02May2020,2
194,"Hi. I'm 13. My name is Agnes and I live in Poland. I have 2 questions.
1. I need to stop eating. And before you say anything, no I do not have ED. I weight 82kg and my height is 173cm. I just need motivation to stop eating when I'm not supossed to. I know that I have to excersise and I think I will 😁.
2. I need money. My sister has a diffrent dad who is richer and he gives her money every month. My parents do not have very much money. So I am looking for job. But Idk where and what to do. I need to help my parents because we live in a flat and want to buy a house. I hope that I can help my family.",02May2020,1
196,"So I tend to form lifelong emotional attachments to certain close friends (thanks aspergers) or at least emotionally invest deeply in people I'm chatting and flirting with. 

I've always been there for friends after their suicide attempts, divorces, heartbreaks and various other big life events. I've just been the one to listen and comfort. I do it because I care deeply and also because I know sometimes when things get bad in my life I really need people to talk to and fall back on. 

But for whatever reason. Maybe there is something wrong with me. I just don't get the same support back. 

I do have a few amazing friends that I've considered family for years. But many other people just seem to be there to use me emotionally and then consider me narcissistic when I ask for them to be there for me. 

As with romantic relationships I always seem to have such intense conversations with people and go on a few dates and the other person seems very enthusiastic and flirty. Then suddenly they realise that they aren't that interested anymore and instead of telling me the texts replies just get longer apart or stop all together. Then most of the time within a month I see the person is in a new Facebook relationship with someone they have just met. 
Its not even that I'm looking for a romantic relationship, but sometimes I just meet someone who I think is amazing and tells me they think the same of me.",02May2020,1

209,"I know this sounds somehow weird but I wanted to talk about this and didn't know where to post it except here. I will start simply by saying that I have kind of obsession with my internal organs since I was little. I would spend a lot of time drawing them and I didn't think it was anything weird. But since a few years ago I have started very vividly imagining them at random times, such as while I am working or socializing or trying to fall asleep. I then end up kinda drifting off mentally for a couple of minutes to an hour, with these random ""my organs are drifting outside of my body"" images. I don't understand what it is that draws me so much towards this. After that I would usually continue with my day. I like to think this is just weird but not dangerous or unhealthy since it doesn't affect my mood or my day-to-day life. I just wanted to get this off my chest, sorry if it's not right for this sub.

211,"Wholesome memes are not funny and I am tired of them.  when the first showed up on the scene it was a funny inversion on the typical dark humor you see in most memes.  I chuckled at the thought of kissing my homies goodnight.  But now they are the dominant meme on FaceBook and they are just grating.  

&amp;#x200B;

Chubby kittens and hearts are not funny.  Can you think of a single comedian that derives their humor from wholesome situations?  I can't.  There might be some shit quality video of your local open night mic video where some blurry so and so trying it out but comedy and humor in general comes from hardship and wholesome memes are sorely lacking any of that.

&amp;#x200B;

People who post these all day seem fake or sad.  They are fake if they act positive all the time.  They are sad if posting this stuff cheers them up.  Like mr. Rogers said to us growing up ""Its okay to feel sad"" he didn't say ""its okay to post memes all day.""",02May2020,1

215,"I don't even know how to start this but if I don't say this somewhere I'm going to go fucking insane. 

I'm a 20 year old woman. About two years ago I finally left an abusive on and off boyfriend, and the relationship left me really traumatized. I was starting to think I was getting over it but being stuck alone with my thoughts in quarantine has made it all come back to me and nothing is making it go away. 

I love my school and my friends, but between trauma from my ex and some really shitty experiences I've had with some friends at school, I'm always convinced that all my friends hate me and don't actually want me around. 

I attempted suicide once when I was 14, and once last year. Nobody found out what I did the first time. The second time, I was hospitalized and went to therapy for a while until I convinced my mom I didn't need it anymore. 

I like to think of myself as being pretty, but I feel like everybody flirts with me for fun but nobody wants to love me. Everyone always has someone better, someone they'd rather talk to, and I don't think anyone lights up when they get a text from me. I'm so fucking sensitive and scared of life and nobody would ever want to spend their life with me. 

I'm miserable. I'm sad about the state of the world, I'm sad that my college education that I was enjoying has been flipped upside down, I'm sad that nobody loves me, I'm sad that nobody will, I'm sad that I have a chronic incurable illness that I won't be able to afford to treat when I'm financially independent from my family, 
I'm sad that one stupid boyfriend fucked me up so goddamn bad. He got in my head and ripped everything out and rearranged it how he liked it and now I can't put it back together how it was. 

The only thing stopping me from ending everything is my mom. My mom is the smartest, prettiest, funniest woman I know. We drink wine together and recommend books to each other and cook together and send each other shitty memes even though she never understands them and she is a fucking genius. She's so smart, I could listen to her talk about the Italian Renaissance for hours. She loves otters and chocolate and Shakespeare and Muse and shitty wine and she talks like the world is always listening and if it was, the world would be a much better place. 

If I died it would break her and I know it. And the thought of putting my mom through pain like that makes me sick. But I can't fucking live like this anymore. I'm so fucking stuck and so fucking sad and I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live like this but I can't die knowing what it would do to my mom.",02May2020,1
