1,"This is a story that i wanted to share about me. 

So i was around 13 to 14 when this happened. I was sleeping over at my best friends house that night and we were in the living room. His parents and sister were sleeping in their rooms. We were getting hungry so we decided to sneak out of the house like we always do. We wanted Mc donalds and also thought it was a chance to see if they were open 24/7 like they say.

So we go down a road that is behind a gas station to get to the main road. We go down the main road and make it to the Mc donalds. We check and see that they are not open. We were upset so we start going back. My friend then gets an idea and thinks we should go ding dong ditching. My dumbass agrees and so we go to a trailer park across the road that is a couple of minutes away from the Mc donalds.

We were thinking that the Mc donalds would open soon, so we could just stay outside and wait for them to open. As we get to were we need to cross the street to get to the trailer park we start to run across the street. As we do that sirens start blaring out and come to us. We start running even harder but then i hear a cop say stop and a dog barking. I know my fat ass wouldn't out run a dog so i stop as my friend runs ahead and leaves me. I wasn't super mad because shit happens and he was far gone before i could tell him To stop. The cop comes up to me and watches me as another squadcar pulls up. I get put into a female cops squad car and as they put me there They ask me who my friends name is and i just say his name as a small act of revenge and to just comply with the cops. They call his name but he is already long gone. The lady cop then gets in the squadcar as another squadcar leaves and goes into the trailer park in search of my friend. Im pretty calm and just thinking about why im being taken into custody. 

They then take me to the gas station me and my friend passed by earlier and i realize why they got me. Of all the nights the one we decide to go to Mc donalds is the night when the gas station gets robbed. At this moment im like oh shit the gas station was robbed. The cops start asking me questions but im calm since i know i didn't do shit. I tell them we went to Mc donalds and didnt do it. I then have to wait in the squadcar for a couple of hours. I talk to the lady cop and she says that she deals with my friend all the time. 

Another coo coos and checks my shoes for a bit and then asks me what i want from mc donalds. I was thinking ""sweet free food"" but then they asked where my parents were. I told them i was at a sleepover and they both don't live in town. Dad doesn't answer but if he did he would be upset that i got caught by the police and not why i was with the police. Mom answers is is upset but i didnt do shit so i didn't care. 

We go to my friends house and i see him there. We look at each other and i just shrug at him. After the cops talk to his parents we honestly didn't get in trouble just a stern talking. We go to the living room and after some akward silence i offer him one of the egg mcmuffins i got from the cop and we start eating. After finishing i tell him What happend and we just laughed about it. 

It was an interesting experience but i got free food so it was fine.",23Sep2020,1
2,"The way it pervades the atmosphere and soaks into everything. 

I sit next by my campfire right in the cloud of smoke. It stings my eyes so I close them. It burns my nostrils so I breath it in through my mouth.

Why does it always burn my eyes and nose long before it scorched my throat and lungs?

I move in closer. My entire body is immersed. The billowing smoke immerses every inch of my clothes and body. It fills my lungs and now they burn but I stay there for well over an hour.

I enjoy bathing my clothes my body and my lungs in its delicate and dark embrace.",23Sep2020,1

4,"I walked to the park alone for the first time yesterday. It's only about a mile and a half from my house but I have severe anxiety, there's an extremely heavily trafficked street that only recently got a crosswalk, my father doesn't really approve and despite the fact that I'm almost 21 it messes with my head - but I DID IT and I was so happy. The outdoors is really where I'm supposed to be, I've always known that in my heart the literal weeks at a time I've spent stuck in the house was slowly killing me.

Yesterday was just about proving to myself I could do it, today I went to enjoy myself. And I was absolutely in awe to stumble across THREE deer all of 30 feet away from me, and even closer as they drew near. Basically out in the open at the edge of the woods. And I didn't take my phone or a camera because I didn't think I'd need it and now I'll never forgive myself. But they were just nibbling and chilling and living their best deer life, and I stood very still and watched them for maybe ~10 minutes. They were so beautiful. And then I went along a trail in another area of the park and spotted a fourth deer. 

Before today, the closest I've ever seen deer is all the way at the opposite side of a cornfield while my dad's driving somewhere.

I just so so so wish I could've gotten a picture or video. I'll always take my phone from now on but this will probably never happen again ever in my life lol",23Sep2020,1
5,"For background, I'm 21 and Trans
When this relationship was underway, I was 18 and still presenting as Male

I met this girl via a mutual friend from my college
We had similar interests and both studied the same course, albeit at different colleges

We slowly started to develop feelings for each other, and eventually decided to start dating, before quickly becoming an item.

Things went swimmingly for a while, but soon arguments started to crop up over menial things. Me accidentally leaving her on read, wording something wrongly and having it come across as an insult and even not talking to her via text when I was busy at school would usually lead to an argument, wherein she wouldn't talk to me, would refuse to try and rectify the situation, leaving me to have to drive to hers to see her in person and sort it out.

Usually when I'd see her I'd struggle to articulate my feelings and opinion, I get quite overwhelmed when in a confrontation, and her raising her voice and being aggressive would leave me unable to properly talk.

We eventually started writing letters when we were in a rut. I'd write down how I'd feel, recognising what I'd done wrong and apologise. In retrospect it seems like I'd been naughty and school and had to write lines or an apology letter or something. I'd give her the letter when I'd see her, and hope it conveyed my apology and sincerity. 

This kind of behaviour continued, with me fronting the blame whenever something happened, all the way until I left for university. I was and still am quite crap at making friends, and when I started to make them, she would get mad at me for not talking to her, saying that I was placing my friends over her, and by extension our relationship. I told her I needed a break and some time to get my head together, by this point it was still Freshers and uni hadn't even started yet. But then during the week, she was wildly accusing me of cheating, stating that she was suspicious of me getting with someone else due to me being over 70 miles away. I despise cheaters, I think it's the lowest way someone can hurt their partner, and I especially wouldn't cheat on her if I still wanted to be with her, despite the break. I told her this, and reiterated that I wanted to be with her. She believed that I could and would have 'girls lining up' for when and if I broke up with her.

This became too much for me, the constant baseless accusations, both over our nightly FaceTime where she'd randomly ask me if I'm cheating, and then state that she didn't believe me. I broke down when she called me, livid that I'd left her on read when I said I'd message her after getting ready to go to a friends.

I had to sit outside their dorm, in a public hallway with my screaming ex, her saying that I never loved her, that I have another girl lined up (Spoilers, I did not and still don't)  and that I'm a piece of shit for cheating on her, when I hadn't even done so.

I was in pieces, my friends had heard from the dorm and all immediately consoled me and we went out for drinks. This kind of spiralled my drug phase and three years on I'm always tentative of a relationship due to how I was treated, I don't know how to classify it, I don't know if I can go as far as to call it abuse, or whether or not it is abuse, but it's left me afraid of commitment and opening up in a romantic sense to people, as I don't want to be treated like crap and accused for baseless things again.

Am I overreacting to this?",23Sep2020,1
6,"I started a new job today. It's a primarily remote position, but I had to come in for the day to get some things set up. The office is super paranoid, temperature checks for everyone, sanitizer everywhere, masks full-time, the works.

My supervisor asks me whether my remote schedule works or if I can come in more often.

And my dumb ass, feeling the need to justify and explain everything so they don't think I'm lazy for wanting to work remote, tells her that I'm preferring to take remote work so I can be available to help my partner while he's laid up with post-covid syndrome.

In a covid-paranoid office.

I just. Blurted it out. Because ""I want to work remote for personal reasons"" is evidently something I'm incapable of saying.

He's tested negative. I've tested negative. He's got notes from his doctors saying he doesn't need to quarantine anymore. But I didn't get that part out. Just. ""My partner is still experiencing symptoms.""

In my new office.

With a covid-paranoid boss.

So my super says something along the lines of ""you might want to keep that to yourself"" and instantly I feel like an untrustworthy child when I already suffer from out of control imposter syndrome.

Anyway, this might have unseated the incident with the sushi chef from 9th grade as my go-to ""how fucking stupid and incompetent am I?"" Thought as I drift off to bed every night.

That is all.",23Sep2020,1

8,"19M. Long post.

I have been soing some critical self reflection and I would like to hear some thoughts.

I daydream and worry a lot and I think they might be somewhat related to eachother.

I worry a lot. I have had trouble with health anxiety, and every now and then I get insecure about a random thing. 

I also care about what others think of me but I like to think I don't. I would like to care less and be more confident.

I also daydream a lot. Specifically hypothetical situations in which I am the protagonist. However, I settle for the enjoyment I get from imagining stuff resulting in me not doing anything.

For example. I keep daydreaming about a girl I just met and like, resulting in these daydreams remaining unrealisti in a sense. My attitude is ""eh, I will see what happens"" instead of ""lets try to make it happen"". On a larger scale this mentality is also prevalent when it comes to future life dreams.

Lastly, I feel like part of this has to do with me not truely loving myself. (What is that, anyway?)

Don't get me wrong, I do not hate myself. I am more than content with myself.

But for example, when I am being told by female friends I am a decent looking guy, I don't really, really believe it. My initial thoughts are ""you're just saying that because you're my friend"".

Conclusively, I feel like being more confident in myself is key. Yet I don't know how.

Thanks for reading. I know this is a bit of an inciherent post but I just wanted to share what has been on my mind. If anything I hope some of you can relate.",23Sep2020,1

14,"I share a birthday with my paternal grandmother because my mom is cs and grandma insisted on that date. I’ve always had a bit of a problem with this because i get almost completely ignored every single year when we celebrate with family (which we always have to do bc my parents and i live with her). I can’t even spend the day how I want to. Even when she eventually passes, I can already see how our birthday will be spent remembering her instead of giving me just that liiiiiittle bit of attention I missed out on. Anyway, that’s not the point of this whole thing. The point is this upcoming weekend is gonna be that celebration and i just found out my cousin (who happens to be her favorite grandchild) will be announcing his engagement on the same day. I’m happy for him, sure. But I can’t help but to think my thunder has been stolen YET AGAIN. Thunder that I barely had. Liiike couldn’t he have waited a few days? My grandma will NOT shut up about this for sure since she does not like the girl he’s marrying. This weekend isn’t really the birthdate but the weekday after and I’ve already accepted that this weekend was for her. I was hoping to claim the actual date for me. BUT NO. My cousin had to snatch that away because im positive this is the only thing my grandma will be talking about at least for the next few weeks. Endless discussions of her favorite grandchild, who she’s been unfairly treating as a prince up until this day even though he’s almost 30, and his fiance who will never be good enough in her eyes.

18,"14F. This is my first post. For over a month now my mom has been experiencing paranoid delusions that a celebrity sent spies to go after her. She came back home today(from another city) and she believes that all the people in the airplane, including the crew were paid to go after her. When she was re-telling the story, I had 2 trains of thoughts. First was that this was the nail in the coffin. That what I had theorized over a month ago was right. She was having some sort of psychotic break. The other part was thinking ""Ok, enough fun guys. Cruel joke you pulled"". Turns out my eldest brother(21) actually believes this stuff, at least that's what my dad said. He said my brother cussed him out. But I'm naturally a skeptical person so I decided to call my brother to make sure my dad wasn't pulling pranks on me. Turns out he does believe my mom and is planning to move out of his apartment because 'people put cameras and listening devices'. My dad doesn't even seem to care that much anymore. He's feeding into her delusions. I've been diagnosed with social phobia and depression about a year ago and have been having regular panic attacks for about 2 years now. Not on medication.

^(VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED!)

&amp;#x200B;

**Context**

My farther instilled a deep, hardcore fear of lawnmowers in me that is growing in severity. I am a full grown man (I can already hear you calling me a pussy through my computer. Go ahead, get it in while you still can.  You won't feel that way for long ;) )  He told me a few stories about people who were killed from heavy and or sharp ass shit being blasted out of the discharge chute. 

One of his good friend's friends knew an old man that was mowing the lawn while his wife was watering the flowers. They were freshly retired. They had been intensely looking forward to this for all of their lives.

Ron casually mowed down a lane of grass.  ""Our life has only just begun!"" thought Ron. He made a 180° loop with his john deer, (Don't get me started on that goddamn turn radius man) and began mowing down the next lane. "" I think I'm going to surprise Joyce with that trip to Hawaii she had dreamed about since she was a kid!"" CLUNK! ""Well shit, guess I'm gonna need a new belt. Hey, Joyce.... JOYCE, I need you for a se.."" There she lay. She was gone, undoubtedly gone. There really is no questioning someoneone surving a rocketing railroad spike through the temple.

Ok, all my dad really told me was the cause and effect (lawnmower, run over railroad spike, blastoff). I'm sorry for the description lol, but that description is pertinent to your understanding of my fear of lawnmowers. Now, you still might think this fear is illogical. ""Kwat, dude, what do you think the odds are of that happening"". Logically I could completely understand that, but this fear wasn't coming from a part of my brain that likes to sit down, take a breath, and ponder the logistics. 

The following is where my fear was cemented:

**The Day of the Lawnmower**

^(September 11, 2020)

It was a perfect spring evening out in the midwestern countryside. 68°, sunny, and not a cloud in motherfucking sight. Me and the good ole family were playing a competitive game of croquet (we take everything as a competition man, that's a whole other story). Nothing could make this night anymore perfec...  
 

BAMMM!  
 

The fam simultaneously jumped what must have been 3 feet off the ground, the birds scattered in a frenzy of raining turds, and the neighbors who bought those dogs just to put them in cages (ok I am going to stop myself there smh) started howling. Something landed on top of the truck, I was certain. I got ready to move closer to investigage when on que this intimidating, black, razor-sharp sharp metal rod pierced the ground TEN FEET INFRONT OF US! 

We all looked at each other. After eye contact verification that this really did just happen, we looked into the sky. Impossible. There is nothing but sky. How in the absolute fuck did that just happen? 

I heard a faint ""^(neeeeeee"") in the distance. Me and my dad made eye contact. Mystery solved.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

My father went across 1 acre of front yard, a whole 180 degrees around our house, across another acre of our backyard, accross the street, and up to Bob. Turns out that killing machine that rained down from the sky was one of his garden stakes. His 0turn launched that sucker up accross the road, over our house, into the parking lot. It then ricocheted off the top of my dad's truck back up into the sky, and in its final moment of glory, straight into the dirt.

When I tell her I have no motivation in life or I don’t wanna be anything or do anything she tells me it’s depressing for her and I stress her out even more. She tells me I better find some motivation but if it was that easy I’d do it

I also fight with my 15 year old sister a lot which also stresses my mom, she usually tells me this is why she’s never home anymore and she can’t stand us
I want to be the bigger person but my sister is a nasty person most of the time, she’ll be sweet for a while then turn on me, insulting me, sometimes even throwing little things at me ( if she’s mad she’ll throw bigger stuff)

in return I become extremely petty, for example I’ll annoy her by turning off the light, or putting up the volume or argue with her or making comments (not necessarily nasty) but annoying like
‘Are you big mad or little mad’ (that one gets her a lot)
it’s entirely childish and petty of me but my mom expects me to sit there and take her jabs and insults, it hurt me a lot though, I can’t keep myself from being petty when my sister gets like that. But my mom always bring up that I’m the bigger person and that I shouldn’t let her get to me and to just shut up

My sister sometimes tells me she hates me and after everybody getting in a big fight earlier she told us to go to hell, I know I belong there
I barely leave my house now( COVID helps with that) and I’m scared of death, when my mom goes out I get mad at her for not texting me if she’s okay or anything and she gets mad at be and says she’s an adult she doesn’t have to text me that and I have no right as her child to get angry when she goes out at night.

I’d still have no friends, they drain me)
I graduated a couple of months ago from high school and I’m doing nothing, I don’t like anything besides reading sometimes, watching tv or scrolling through my phone.


**Long story short**
I can’t do anything right, I overthink simple tasks and end up doing them wrong, I don’t talk to my friends anymore because they used me as their dumping grounds for their problems and emotions, I have no reason to be sad or crying in the bathroom all the time. I don’t have a bad life really, my mom tells me other people have it worse than me. I know that and I know I’m acting like a spoiled brat. I have social anxiety ( not diagnosed) and I can’t do simple shit right and I ask dumb questions. I cause problems for my mom, my sister hates me and it hurts.

I've gotten more No's than I care to remember, but I finally got everything in my app dialed and did a good job of reaching out and networking. I'm starting to get interviews all of a sudden and its to the point where I've actually had to turn a couple down that I wanted and was qualified for. Those wanted me to find myself two states over within a day just to do an exam and not for the position itself even though they advertised as remote. Tomorrow is a big day and I'm emotional already. I'm just happy that someone is willing to give me a chance. 

This year has been crappy. I had to walk away from my dream career because of mental health. I've been locked back at home and had to lose my relationship with the only person I've ever wanted to be a husband to. But I also did the hard work not to fall victim to my past and to use this time to grow. I confronted my PTSD and depression and looked for answers instead of running like I have all my life. I've gone back to the very root of my deepest fears and concerns just to start feeling normal for the first time in my life. I've started taking care of my health and lost almost 60 pounds. I've been able to learn new things and discover myself. I've focused on myself and my happiness and identity for the first time and I have done my best to just embrace myself and love myself. 

It hasn't been easy and I've often not been able to see light at the end of the tunnel. But I made my own path and have been working extremely hard to dig myself out. Nobody can take that away from me.",23Sep2020,1

My 18th birthday is next month and I feel like I grew up too early. 

Every year since I turned 15 in fact, I've had this feeling. I don't have too many friends and am not very close to my family. I had several plans that were supposed to be completed before I turned 18. But, alas, here I am, being a nobody, in NobodyLand. Not that I'm blaming anyone, though.

My life is a complete and total mess. Quarantine has left me without limbs (*metaphorically),* with two sore eyes and a giant fucking pair of glasses. I am NOT who I thought I was going to be at 18. I am weaker, clumsier, lazier, and less focused. I have no clue of my destination, or the journey to it, for that matter.

hello everyone, i’m a 17 yo guy who’s having a bad “period”. “period” cause it’s been 4 years that my looks destroyed my self esteem. And it’s been 4 years that i discovered people just give you value for the only thing you can’t change of yourself naturally: your looks. Or better: your face, because you still can improve physically, but the face is something that can’t be changed anyway if not with surgery. People insult me while im on the streets and on socials too ( i deleted them all because of this ) and girls don’t even treat me like a human being the most of the times. I’m done about everything. My mum continues telling me cliche sentences like “love comes when you less think about of it” or “you’re not ugly, you just should smile more” and all others hurtful bullshit. You can still have your passions but your looks will help you much more when interacting with people. In some months time, i’ll be 18, but nobody wants to come to my party ( and i don’t want to spend it like a normal day... i mean, it would hurt a little )... i’ve not even mentioned the topic “girlfriend”, so you can guess how the situation actually is.

When vacation came I felt happy for the first time in what seemed like forever, I got closer with my friends, had a date, a job and things were looking good, I had already talked with some people about quitting school and everyone advised me against it and I accidentally told my mom about it when I got drunk but that turned out ok, then 2019 came, and I just KNEW I couldn't take that again for another year, so I ended up quitting college right at the beggining of the second year, I started helping my mom with her business until I got an actual job and that turned out to be an entire year, mid-March 2020 to be exact, it was supposed to be a good job, hard work but I didn't had any experience (or a degree) so I was expecting something like that, but then Corona happened, I was meant to start in April but I never got the chance.

Instead I realize that I've spent a decade of my life in academia for a discipline and profession that has been decimated in the past six months. Although deleting social media has had its benefits, I now have no contact with others (and their annual conciliatory but still appreciated birthday wishes). Never having a girlfriend has become less of a concern in recent years, but maybe it should be a bigger problem at my age and objective lack of experience. I still do not have a house, a salary, or a retirement plan.

85,"I just need to get this off my chest. Ever since this happened last night I've felt like complete shit and I just want to write it out. On Saturday my friend and I were fighting. She blew me off the previous two nights and I was basically like you can't keep doing this, it's not fair to me and yeah. If it was just those two nights I wouldn't have said anything, but it was starting to become a reoccurring problem. She made a promise to me that she wouldn't do that as it isn't fair to me and was like some of her problems were mental health related and that's why she skipped out some of the time not in every instance though, it's about 50/50.

 Last night we were supposed to meet for dinner at 6:30 and I show up to the place. She's not there  so I send her a text saying I'm here, just lmk when you get here. 5 minutes go by and she's still not there so i sent her another text basically saying you now we have plans right? Eventually it gets to 6:45 and I just ordered my food and left at that point. I then texted her saying ""Now you're just blowing me off without saying anything?"". I probably shouldn't have said that. I also struggle with my mental health issues a bit and some of it manifests itself in this way.  As a kid I was kinda bullied and some of them would pull shit like that on me. The constant blowing me off just really kinda puts me back in that mind set I guess. It doesn't make what I said right or smart, but that's why I immediately went there, it's something I'm working on but I still need too.

 Eventually she responded (probably 7:15ish) saying, ""you know I wouldn't do that, I promised I wouldn't, I fell asleep."" My response to that was essentially yes you may have promised not to do that, but you still broke the promise 3 days later. I then sent a follow up text about an hour later saying, ""if you had just been like sorry, we can grab lunch tomorrow and not have been like I promised you that so like I wouldn't do it, I would not have been mad."" She ignored me until this morning and  then left all the messages on read. I did send a text that she hasn't opened yet apologizing for my tone last night, admittedly I was probably too harsh on her, but it's a reoccurring issue and I can't deal with this anymore. I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. I just am exhausted. I legitimately care about her a lot and don't want to lose her as a friend, but idk if I can keep doing this. I can't deal with the constant rejection.

86,"So this is my first time on reddit, I literally created an account to tell this story.

Here is some names your gonna need to know so you can best understand this story: Spidey - The mentally ill college student who is also most likely a sociopath. Mixable: The unfortunate kid who fell into his manipulative ways. Eric: The 10 year old who's followed in Spidey's manipulative ways. Me = Me. Also any extras will be addressed later.

So this story starts on July 4th Independence day. I had a minecraft world and every year me and my friend Jack made a fireworks show to celebrate. We make a looking for group post to get more peeps in this year and there comes a guy named ""Spidey"" (thats not his real name im just censoring it for privacy). Spidey joined the party and he sounded like a 20 something in college. Then we got other people in the post. I realized I saw Spidey's name before, and I remembered he was on a comment thread on a controversial xbox post. He said he had a YouTube channel and he did! He had 1.1k subs and made minecraft content. Spidey said he a ""YouTube crew"" (ya know like ""The Pals"" from roblox that kind of crew of friends). He asked if I wanted to join, I said yes and so did my friend. Spidey and the crew would always record lets play videos on his survival world. Spidey also started an xbox group chat to let us know about video ideas. And cue ""Eric"". Eric"" was Spidey's good friend (not irl), but Eric was like 10 or something. Anyways more people started to join the crew, like ""Jake"" and ""DJ"".

&amp;#x200B;

Months pass, blah blah blah. Then around mid August something snaps in Spidey. He went form the chill, kinda screwloose college student, to a sociopath. All of a sudden he added a lot of rules in the group chat. One of the group chat members, ""Galaxy"" was really into anime, I'm talking full on weeb, (i dont like anime, but no hate to those who do). Apparently, anime really ticked Spidey off for some reason, who be banned any anime related things in the group chat. Everyone was upset about this, and told Spidey that he couldn't just create rules based off his opinions. Then he started accusing each and every one of us ""Among Us"" style. Saying that we were the reasons there were so many rules. At that point everyone had enough of this man's BS. Cue Eric, he decided to make his own youtube channel and his own group chat and invited all the original spidey members to the chat. For a while everything in Eric's group chat was fine. All the members pretty much had a good time. Until, Eric decided the group chat was getting too weird, and he wanted to add some rules of his own. This mf added 50 rules to the group chat. Ain't nobody got time for that. Everyone was pissed at Eric for this, especially me. He made rules about no talk about weird stuff, or dark humor. Now I am all for dark humor and some of the other rules were pretty dumb. Eric just brushed it off and asked if anyone wanted to make a Fortnite video. Nobody wanted to play Fortnite, they wanted to play Minecraft. Eric said that our opinions didn't matter and that we were gonna make a fortnite video no matter what. He then manipulated everyone to make a fortnite video with him. It was clear no one could enjoy themselves in the video. (eric's channel is still up btw) Eric said the spidey told him he deleted his channel and made a new one, because ""The stress of the old youtube crew was making him insane"". Eventually I had enough of Eric and left his crew. Cue Mixable, this mf with a cod pfp sends me a message saying ""why is your pfp angel dust"" (i like hazbin hotel stfu), I said ""its my xbox i can make my pfp hentai i want). He then said ""bro its weird"", I said ""idgaf about ur opinion"". He then started to say random shiz about himself but at that I just ignored it. Then a week later he messaged me saying ""bro why u fanboying over angel its a guy"" followed by ""f u kid"" and ""bro ur pfp is making my anxiety occur"". At that point I replied with a ""i think spidey is telling u to do this. Both you and him need help."" I then blocked him.

My lecturer said I was amazing and did so well, praising me for like a full minute. It feels good to have your hard work acknowledged yes, but I don't want the expectations that come with it. My class mates praised me too in the group chat and I thanked them trying to spread the praise over my entire group and change the topic. It worked fairly well. Then I got a bunch of private messages still praising me. 

I always get scared when I'm flooded with so much positivity. I am so appreciative that I basically got a good pat on the back and I'm definitely passing that assignment, but I don't want to be a source of envy for someone with low self esteem. I don't want to be the person people talk about in secret trying to determine whether I'm actually a good person or not. I don't want to be the subject of conversations period. I just want to be. If I had it my way, I would have loved to be told of my job well done by my lecturer in private, and treated like a nobody the next day. But now people already have this idea formed of me as some really good speaker or whatever, I'm sure it won't take long for many to assume I'm secretly really smart and then patiently wait to ask what I got in my exams. I've seen this happen over and over, in middle school, in high school, A Levels... 

I actually used to be super competitive as a little kid, but that totally fucked with my mental health, carrying everyone's expectations on my shoulders. So I slowly slipped out of that role. I made up my mind when I started uni 3 months ago that I won't be anything but a passing name. I will only participate in classes that actually have that graded and pretty much just speak when spoken to or have a burning question. But I guess I can throw that out of the window now. *sigh*",23Sep2020,1

94,"I have been told often times that I am conceited, selfish, only think of myself, competitive and the list goes one by one specific friend of mine. I would even call them a bestfriend of mine. To give some history, I do think at one point in my life I was very competitive and I enjoyed showing off my high scores and talking about my accomplishments... and it cost me a lot of friendships at the time. However, since then I decided to become more conscious about what I was saying around others and try to eliminate those bad habbits. Now, I would say I am significantly better than before. I try not to bring something ""good"" up if its about myself unless others are asking or its relevant, because I don't want to seem conceited. However, I have this one friend who is always talking about how selfless they are and how they give everything that they have to help others around them. Which I believe is totally untrue. This person only ""gives everything they have"" for the wrong people (i.e. abusive partners). I have given so much of my time and sacrificed a lot to be there for this person whenever they needed me. I was litterally available to listen to them or do whatever they needed 24/7. And by whatever, I honestly mean whatever. I would drop anything to help them if need be. I felt like I did everything this person asked, but still, if we ever got in a fight, I was suddenly being called names and told I only cared about myself. This has really hurt me, because I considered this person to be very close to me. Now I feel like they are competing with me somehow. Like everything is a competition. But I don't know if I just feel this way because I am apparently a competitive person by nature or because they are truly being competitive. Recently, I have noticed that during any conversation that we have, its always directed back towards them. Everything has to be about them all the time and I am so over it. I feel really sad, because I feel like it's me thats caused all this. Like I am inherently wired to ruin every relationship I come into. Anyways, I guess I'm here to ask if you think someone can change their personality purposefully or is it just something that you have to find other people who fit with your personality?",23Sep2020,1

96,"I am afraid that I may have made a rushed promise to God about stop doing a bad habit. The bad habit was sticking booger below my home desk. I am afraid if I rushly, made the promise and asked for punishment in order to make sure that I will stop doing it. Like threating myself in order to have higher chances of never doing that bad habit. If in case there is such a promise, does it count?

I did not have ocd issues with promises that time but it was a period that I had religious ocd. Just, without the promises. Can this promise be considered as an ocd promise, even if I had control of my thoughts?

Today, I had a booger in my hand. a small piece. and i forgot about it for 1-2 seconds, and put my hand below my desk. I think, I did not touch my desk. I moved it away from my desk and the booger was still on my hand.

What if there was another piece of booger that accidentally, was stuck on my desk without noticing, while I had my hand below the desk for some seconds? Did I broke the promise? Will I be punished? I know I have ocd issues with rushed promises to God, but that was BEFORE that issues with the promises. is it still, ocd or not?'

I checked the desk and I do not see any piece of booger stuck. But, what if it was stuck for some seconds and then, fell on the ground? I am angry with myself for forgeting that I had a booger in my hand.

98,"I really want to find someone who wants to be together with me. 


I remember, in 2018, I worked in a catering event, and I met a girl and asked her out. She said yes, and I was so happy. I was thinking about everything I was hoping we could do together, and how great our relationship was going to be. I was completely broke and didn't have much money for a first date, but I knew that, at the train station, the first class lounge had free food, and wasn't guarded (I know because I once ran out of food, and I walked about town trying to find free food). I was hoping we could go there for our first date, and then go climbing at a climbing wall later. I remember when, on the last day of the event, I asked her if she was still up for Monday, and she said no. I cried. I don't think she expected me to cry, because she looked really shocked and sad too. I still cry a lot about this now, sometimes at home, but sometimes on the train too. I think we would have been so happy together. I don't really know what I did wrong, even though I've thought about it at least every other day this year. Sometimes, I get delusional thoughts that she actually wanted to go on the date with me, but I just misinterpreted what she meant.


I always think about the week we worked together, and the great memories I have of talking to her and spending time with her. I deleted her number straight away, because I knew I'd be tempted to text her. I was 19 then, and it was a really big thing for me to find someone before I turned 20, and I thought she was going to be that person.


I worked hard, and became the team leader of a door to door sales team that same summer. I tried my best to forget the girl from that event (because she rejected me, and it's best to move on), and asked out other girls. Unfortunately, I'm not really good with people, so I didn't really find anyone. I think I might have asked out ~30 girls that summer. The only reason I was ""good"" at sales is because I followed the script, spoke confidently, and genuinely worked hard.


I read on Reddit back in 2018, and a lot of commenters suggested that I focus on myself more, and try to ignore the dating aspect, which is what I did.


Later in 2018, I moved back in I got a professional job in IT. At 19, I started earning £25000+/year. I thought that if I worked hard, a girl would notice the hard work and give me a chance. It was hard work because I didn't have much experience, qualifications, and I didn't really know what I was doing, but I managed to succeed. 


I'm still at this job now, and I was previously working on IT certifications that would have put me towards 6 figures by the end of my 20's. But when I looked into the future, towards my late 20's, I could easily see myself earning 6 figures and still being single, which is why I stopped working on them. I was also studying for an online CS degree, but I stopped working on this for the same reason. It's 2020 now, and I've been wanted so long for a girl to give me a chance. I thought that a higher salary wouldn't really help me find someone. Besides, my ""fantasy"" was always finding someone when I was broke and didn't have much going for myself, and staying with that person my whole life. I guess I just don't want to be earning 6 figures, and then find someone who wants me for the money.


I have so many adventures I want to do with someone, but I delay them, because I want to have them with that one special girl. When I've thought about these adventures, I've always imagined myself with someone. For example, I wanted to take the FREC3. This is a week long pre-hospital qualification. The idea is that we'd always be able to help each other on our outdoor adventures if anything happens. But I want to take it together with the person I want to have these adventures with. I've also thought about places I'd like to explore with someone, and things like the scuba training to get.


I still go on some solo adventures. For example, I sometimes free solo. In 2019, I swam across the widest river in a country I was visiting. I woke up at 05:00 so noone would see me, and went for the swim. I remember, in the middle of the river, I had the feeling someone was pulling my leg down, and it was pretty scary. I almost didn't want to swim back across when I got to the other side, but I realised I had no choice, so I forced it. 


I've always been really fit, and I had a really prominent 6-pack and an honestly 9-10/10 physical shape before lockdown. I still have a 6-pack and I'm in good-okay shape, but the calisthenics I do at home limits what I can achieve. I also started learning French, and eventually reached B1 level. English is my 3rd language. Just to add, I'm naturally good looking and my height is 6'3"" - 6'4"".


I'm not really social, and don't have any friends in the UK even thought I've lived most of my life here. Unfortunately, my connections with my friends in my home country have also frayed due to long absences, so it's pretty much just me. I also don't speak with anyone at work even though I've worked there for so long and go into the office every day, which is probably why a girl from work hasn't given me a chance. I have also joined a couple of sports clubs in the town I live in, but I also don't speak to anyone even though I've been a member for 2+ years, so it's slightly awkward. Imagine being an active member for 2 years and not speaking to anyone at most sessions. At this point, people just walk away from me when I talk lol. I always remember the great connection I had with the girl from 2018, put on the songs I used to sing to her, and cry.


Sometimes, it starts to feel like I don't really want to find someone, and I hate it when this happens. It's a lot worse than crying, because I don't even feel human. I know that I get this feeling because I've wanted someone for so long and haven't found them. It never used to happen before. My biggest fear is that this becomes permanent, and then I wouldn't feel anything even if I found a girl and we were cuddling. I really want that sweet relationship where you hang out in the park, laugh, and just do silly things together.


My plan right now for finding a girlfriend is going to university. I'm 21, and I would have liked to keep working on my IT career and get a high salary, but I don't see the point if I don't have a girl to share this with. I'm not sure if I can see a path to finding a girl from here. I'm leaving my job, I've moved out again, and I am studying for a pre-university entry qualification. 


I'd like to study Engineering at university because this is genuinely interesting for me, but the main reason for me going is to find a girlfriend, so I am considering doing the subject makes this more likely. I've also thought about doing Medicine, because this is fairly high-status, and I might be able to get a girl attracted to me based on that. I know that if I work hard I can get past the interviews, because I used to be a sales team leader, and know how to sell myself in a professional context. The only problem is that I don't really want to do Medicine, but I would do it for sure if I knew that a girl would date me if I became a doctor. I don't think I would have a lot of time to spend together if I chose this option, though. We probably wouldn't be able to travel much either.


I will probably go with Molecular Biology for my undergradute, just because this is a subject that also really interests me, and also because a lot more girls take Biology than guys, so I hope I can meet someone.",23Sep2020,1
99,"Self-appreciation post incoming!

^(Warning: if you’re not into positivity look away)

Cool, so, I’m posting this because I am facing a stressful week, I'm turning 30 soon, and it’s been a weird time... and while my confidence level has gotten better it’s still insanely spotty. Also I’ve been really pushing out of my comfort zone recently so I’d say while that’s a great thing it has upped my anxiety levels a little bit.

Summer was hard, for obvious world issues right now we’re all dealing with and a few personal things went down that were very confusing and insanely negative. But I didn’t want to be controlled by that negativity and lose myself in some self-pitying cycle. So I just started doing things and making executive decisions in my life. I stopped eating like crap, I started running, and I pushed hard out of my way to reconnect with old friends and create new friendships. Started working on a YouTube channel. Started streaming on Twitch. Started shooting photos again, and continued painting when I could. Went back to piano. Created and participated in community events. Created more structure and routines with choices for myself when I feel bored or overwhelmed. I really introspected a lot, and still am working through issues I want to resolve for myself. 

And honestly I’m crushing it like, yesterday I hit my goal weight?? Which I haven't been in 5 years?? I learned how to shoot and edit video on my own, I moved from to  different state, and then back home all while navigating a job I got just a month or two before everything hit. I’m proud of the resilience I’ve had and the person I’m becoming. 

Welp, that’s my self-appreciation. It feels helps to try and frame yourself in a positive mindset and I hope you all can try it sometime! Thanks for reading if you got this far :')",23Sep2020,1
100,"I’m currently unemployed and living with my parents, and the thought of me being 24 and still stuck in this situation is causing me to spiral back into a depression I fought hard to get out of this past year. 

I moved back home a year ago after leaving a toxic work environment, but because I moved from a big city which I loved to my very small hometown which I hate, this past year has taken a toll on my mental health. My social anxiety has skyrocketed, I’ve gained weight, and because I’m now ashamed of what I look like, I feel like I no longer belong in my old city and I’m too self conscious to date (I never used to be like this). Right after college I landed a great job, but it deteriorated my mental health and caused this anxiety to surface, and I guess I’m feeling ashamed that I had so much potential at 21 but have lost it at 24. 

For some reason it didn’t really bother me too much being 23 and living at home, it still felt like a normal age to not have it all together. 24 though, I’m feeling like a failure. I’m trying to apply to jobs and I know it’s challenging during the pandemic, but I’ve had no luck and I can’t help thinking this is what my life will forever be. I had so much potential growing up and my parents sacrificed a lot to give me a good education, but I can’t help but feel bitter when my education isn’t enough to land an entry level position. 

I know this is a rant, but does anyone have advice on turning 24? I’ve never hated a birthday until now, and really don’t know how I’m gonna cope this week.

102,"I'm only just home but I want to talk about him. He was 8 years old and had been fighting prostate cancer, which we first thought was a urine infection.

He was a barky and loud dog but he wasn't aggressive. He was always up for a game or to cuddle.

He had problems with other dogs, he would always bark at them, loudly, so it was hard to take him out.

I kissed him goodbye at the veterinary carpark and handed him to my mother who went in with him. I didn't think I would cry, I hadn't for most of the time between his diagnoses and now. I held it in a lot whilst there, just sniffling and tearing up but when I got home, I went to my room and wept.

I could only think of any time I was mean to him or gave him into trouble and I felt/feel so much guilt since he probably didn't know why he was in trouble half of the time. I wish I had spent more time with him, but I was always in my room or talking to friends. 

It just breaks my heart to know I'll never see him again and that I can't hold him, or apologise for the times I've screwed up. My dad told me to think about the good times. I hope that's what he remembers.

I have his harness with me right now. It still has some hair on it and it feels weird knowing he was in it just this afternoon.

Cancer sucks. It all went downhill fairly quickly after a few months. He became tired all the time, refused to eat or drink, threw up alot, didn't want to go out, and relied on painkillers each night.

103,"*posted this on r/LetsNotMeet but they took FIVE DAYS to approve it and it got buried, almost no one read it, and it was pretty anticlimactic after disclosing one of the most traumatic events I’d ever lived through, so reposting it here.* 


I worked at a boxing/MMA gym almost 20 years back, basically as an receptionist. We were *deep* in the ghetto. 

I almost didn’t take the job because of the neighborhood’s reputation but the friend who recommended the place said it was the most fulfilling office work I’d ever find, so I gave it a try, and he was right.  

Before working there I thought I’d grown up lower middle class and that I had become pretty broke at that point in my life. Compared to the quality of life of our community, I was Bill Gates. 

The school to prison pipeline was the standard around there and we accepted it was bigger than all of us, so were just trying to divert as many kids away from it as we could. 

As a result, our biggest program was a teen MMA class that met every night except Sundays to keep our kids off the streets.

We had one kid from that program who was a total wildcard. Cisco had been coming since he was four years old and in our after school fitness program, then risen through the ranks to actually become one of our trainers and even a semi-pro fighter.

But as professional and disciplined as he was inside the gym, he could be as wild and unhinged outside. There was just too much going on at home. At the time of this incident, he had just turned 16. 

We had one fitness instructor, Shandra, who knew everything there was to know about physiology, nutrition, and all things exercise, but was as dumb as a brick when it came to common sense. She was always getting roped into MLM type stuff back when they were still called pyramid schemes. 

We poached her from a fancy franchise gym on the other side of town. The owner found out she’d grown up around here and guilt tripped her into coming home. Whenever we had rich looking prospective clients, we always sent her to pitch them instead of our usual outreach people. 

Finally, there was Alsace. Alsace was the golden child of our beat the streets program. Growing up in one of the roughest parts of town, one sibling murdered and two in prison, but she was still in school getting straight A’s and applying to colleges for that next year. 

She came in every day when we opened and stayed every night until we closed. She never spoke a word and couldn’t make eye contact with anyone she hadn’t already known for years. But it was fine. We just let her work in the office. 

I’m only telling you all this so you can understand why everyone reacted the way they did when the day came. 

I was just settling in for a lunch break. It was the middle of the day on a Sunday. The neighborhood was super Christian, so we weren’t “officially” open on Sundays. We kept the facilities running, but we didn’t have any classes or anything. We just unlocked the place in case anyone wanted to come by or needed a place to go.  

Cisco was there, which was a relief because if he wasn’t he was usually somewhere he shouldn’t be. And Shandra had just had a personal training client in the gym who’d left, so she was getting ready to leave too. Alsace was repainting our bathroom that didn’t really need repainting to make some extra money she really did need. 

Cisco didn’t have a reason to be there other than to not be somewhere else, but we always tried to give the kids a sense of purpose, so he was our door guy that day. 

Usually we really do always have someone watching the door, because sometimes randos walked in. Mostly pickpockets or homeless people looking for money. Skeevey guys casing the place out. Whatever. Every business on the block had someone posted by the door to turn them around at the threshold and make sure the place had a reputation as vigilantly watched so not worth the effort to hassle.   

Most of us hated guarding the door, but the young guys loved it, because it made them feel tough in a way that was productive. So, we had Cisco posted up. He wasn’t really paying attention. But it was a Sunday afternoon. No reason he should actually need to. 

Cisco crumpling up pieces of paper and trying to hit Shandra in the head with them (in a playful way) while she did some exercises. I was eating my lunch, filing invoices. Couldn’t have been a more average afternoon at that point. 

Then the door chimed. We had a convenience store style buzzer on it so whoever was in charge could be on notice if someone new entered. 

A guy shuffled in who looked average at first glance, but I could feel his energy was off. I usually greeted new clients from behind the desk, but without even thinking, I stood right away and asked “Can I help you?” In a sharp tone and taking a step out from behind the desk. My spine was tingling. 

The man looked me up and down, eyes flashing a little. He had kind of a limp, but it was his only distinct feature. Other than that he was just wearing a normal t-shirt and jeans. I kept looking at him, hard, to try and figure out what it was about him that made me so uncomfortable.

He didn’t say anything at first, so I repeated again, a little louder and more firmly, “Yo, can I help you with something?” And he just stood there, kind of staring past me. 

Cisco finally tuned in and stood up, drawing his shoulders back and telling the guy, “Alright man, look, we’re closed.” And gesturing out the door. 

I knew he must have sensed something too, because even on his worst days, he was usually friendly when public-facing unless given an overt reason not to be. 

The guy’s face got all twisted up and he asked, “Where’s Paolo?” Fuck if I knew. I told him, “We don’t have a Paolo, you’ve got the wrong place.” But he wasn’t buying it. He clenched his fists and started saying, breathing kind of heavy, “I. Want. To. Talk. To. Paolo.” 

It kind of clicked for Cisco at that point because he’d been there longer than me, so he realized, “Ohhh, look man. Paolo hasn’t worked here in, like, five years. We can’t help you.” But the guy still didn’t seem to process it. I wasn’t here that far back, so I still didn’t know what they were talking about. 

He looked at Cisco dead in the eye and screamed, “DON’T FUCK WITH ME. PAOLO KNOWS WHAT I’M OWED AND I’M NOT LEAVING TIL I GET IT, SO WHAT’S UP?” 

Shandra must’ve heard that through her headphones because she stopped her cool down and came over from across the room to see what was going on. 

Cisco didn’t take too kindly to the shouting, and would never admit this, but was definitely rattled by any unexpected loud noises or yelling. I think something to do with his family life. Anyways, he was pissed from being screamed at, and immediately went to physically escort this guy out. 

He wasn’t the best at deescalation off the cuff, but I also can’t entirely blame him, because often just throwing these guys asses on the curb and locking the door was the most efficient way to deal with them. 

I couldn’t put it out of my head that something about the situation was off though. We bounced two or three people a week, and I’d never gotten a full body visceral reaction like this one. My mind was trying to tell me something. 

This guy had some nervous ticks. Like, he kept kind of resting his hand on his hip a lot. But I thought it was just because his pants were baggy, like a lot of guys around here. 

You may be wondering why I, the adult, was letting the teenage kid do our bouncing for us. The answer is simple. I know nothing about fighting at all. I was working there doing administrative stuff, I’d never thrown a punch in my life. 

So Cisco approached the guy going, “Where the fuck you think you are right now? Better check yourself the next time you come through those doors. We. Are. Closed.” And went to physically throw him out. 

But that’s when I saw it. The guy was grabbing for a bulge... Has a limp, touching his hip a lot, distinct bulge on the same side? They trained us for these signs—this guy was armed. 

“Cisco, step back, step back—“ I tried to warn him, but it was too late. He wasn’t listening to me because he phased everything else out when he felt disrespected. I’d seen him do it in the ring a hundred times. I’d heard stories of it getting him into trouble outside a hundred times. But now was he about to get us all killed? Even in the ring, he never won the fights where he did that. 

“Think what? Think what? Think what?” The guy asked as he pulled the gun out and started waving it around. “Nobody leaves. Nobody leaves until Paolo pays up.” He announced, almost laughing as he said it. 

Thankfully, whether it was instinct, common sense, or a miraculous combination of the two, Cisco put his hands up and stepped back. 

I was more worried about what Cisco would or won’t do than I was about what the guy with the gun would or wouldn’t. We almost lost Cisco when he tried to bring a knife to a gun fight just earlier that year. This guy here was clearly unstable, not trying to prove he was the biggest toughest guy on the street, but I didn’t know if Cisco was mature enough to differentiate between movie style bad guys and reality style mentally ill crackheads.

Shandra wasn’t even approaching cool or collected. I wasn’t worried about her trying a hero play, but what she did instead wasn’t a whole lot better. 

She saw the gun and lost her fucking mind. She started screaming at the top of her lungs, just shrieking, flipping out, literally just, “AAAAHHH, AAAAAHHHHHHH AAHH AAHHHHHH.” 

Of course, I.... did nothing. I mean nothing, nothing. I didn’t put my hands up, didn’t step back, didn’t go help the kid, didn’t tell Shandra to shut up. Nothing. I was frozen in shock. 

To make matters worse, her yelling was stressing the guy out. Cisco saw that and very evenly and calmly started saying, “Shandra, Shandra, hey, excuse me. Shandra. Uh-uh. No. Not helping. Breathe. I need you to breathe hun.”

But there was a plus side to Shandra’s screams. It got Alsace’s attention from back in the bathroom. I caught her ever so gently shutting the door from the corner of my eye. Thankfully, he didn’t. 

I was trying to think of something to say or do. I’m embarrassed to admit it even now, but honestly, I was trying to remember hostage scenes from movies. I drew a complete blank. 

All I could think about was how I’d always wanted to take my dad to a Broncos Super Bowl and that I might die before I got the chance. For some reason that clouded all my thinking about how to potentially not die and kept me from assessing reality. Even now, it’s my clearest memory of the ordeal. 

At least I knew exactly what *not* to do. It wasn’t because of any special expertise or presence of mind. Raw survival instinct just kicked in. If I felt myself going to do or say something that could set the gunman off, my body physically overrode my mind and wouldn’t allow me to. I was paralyzed with fear, but, healthy fear. 

Cisco and his fucking man bun, realizing how totally ineffectual I was being, stepped up to the plate again. He spoke so slowly and calmly from the start. But, like I said, Cisco was a wildcard. I was petrified to have him running this, not knowing if he’d be sweet talking one minute and lunging for the gun or saying something to antagonize the guy another minute. 

That fear and uncertainty just made it even harder for me to take the lead. On top of that, Shandra looked like she might faint at any second. 

“You wanted to talk to Paolo? Let me go get him, ok?” Cisco offered. The guy thought about it for a second and agreed. “Alright. I’m going to go and call him for you, ok?” Cisco asked, not moving a muscle before the guy with the gun said it was acceptable.

“No phones. No, no, no, no...” The guy started muttering. I realized that, with it being Sunday, it could realistically be 24 hours before anyone came into the building or started actionably wondering where any of us were. I was too scared to fully dismay at that additional layer of chaos. 

I think Cisco had planned to call someone other than Paolo, because I could see the disappointment on his face. “Hey man?” He asked, really evenly and soothingly, “How can I get in touch with Paolo for you if you won’t let me call him?” 

“SHUT UP! I’M THINKING!” The guy shouted, kicking over a display stand in a burst of rage. This started Shandra crying. “SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!” He started pacing back and forth. Cisco visibly flinched at the screaming, but soldiered forward. 

“Hey, I’m Cisco.” He said, really calmly. “Do you have something I can call you?” The guy paused for a second, obviously considering his answer. “Just call me Troy. But don’t talk to me. Where’s Paolo?” 

He’d just told Cisco not to talk to him and also asked him a direct question. That was too much, even for him. That survival instinct forced me to start forming some sentences. 

My voice cracked and was barely audible. But it was coherent enough. “So, uh, Troy, was it? He, Paolo, uh... sounds like he, uh, well, he doesn’t work here. But what do you need from him? Maybe, uh, maybe I can help instead?” I asked, telling myself over and over in my head to just treat him like any other disgruntled client and rely on that script. That was muscle memory by this point. I could literally recite it with a gun to my head. 

“Paolo knows what he owes me.” Troy said. I had no clue how to respond to that, but hey, at least he wasn’t shouting anymore. “Can you tell us what Paolo knows he owes you?” Cisco asked, evenly. “No. No, no, no, no, no. I want to deal with him directly. Where is he?” Cisco told him again that we could help him if he just explained what he wanted. 

And it continued like that in a circle for thirty or forty minutes more, with some long silences in between where Troy both cried, and tried to punch through our wall. Unsuccessfully.

Then the phone rang. He didn’t like that. “What is that?” He asked, as though we’d made it ring. “The phone.” I explained, each word taking my breath away. 

“Make. It. Stop.” He commanded. By this point he’d become comfortable enough with Cisco that he was letting him move around a little. They were chatting about baseball and some neighborhood convenience store. He’d actually remained pretty level headed as long as Shandra stopped asking him to just let her go or audibly sobbing.  

So, Cisco slowly went over, picked up the phone, and hung it back up.

Within seconds it was ringing again. “MAKE IT STOP.” Troy bellowed, kicking at another stand. This one was weighted down with concrete, so he hurt his foot, which just made him angrier. 

He started waving the gun around again and chattering some incoherent stuff, rather than holding it at his side like he had been. 

Needless to say, we were all very anxious to shut that phone off. We assumed it was just some ornery parent calling to complain about their child’s tuition charge coming through. We couldn’t have guessed who it actually was. 

So, Cisco picked it up again and hissed “Stop calling, we’re closed. *Stop calling*.” Into the receiver, before slamming it down again. 

It immediately rang a third time. Troy pointed the gun in my general direction and put his finger on the trigger, screaming something with “I SAID CUT IT OFF.” Mixed in. Cisco ripped the phone cord out of the wall. “It stopped, it stopped. You don’t have to do anything. Ok? You don’t have to do anything.” He reassured, more frantic than he’d been through the whole ordeal, eyes locked on the barrel of the gun. 

That whole sequence, of having a gun pointed at me only to be saved by a teenager’s drastic action, felt as though I was watching it happen to someone else more than something that was happening to me. It does even still, looking back. 

For whatever reason, Shandra thought the heels of this phone saga was the appropriate moment to try, for the third or fourth time, to talk her way out of the situation. That got him to move the gun away from me at least. But it didn’t help matters overall, either. 

She kept saying, chattering so quickly you’d think she were a tape on fast forward, “So this really isn’t working, right? So you should probably just let all of us go. Or maybe just leave one of us here, right? Because it’s really the same effect. Or just leave. I mean, no one will know you were ever here and you can go look for Paolo and everything will be fine. Because this isn’t working, and so you should probably just let us go then we can all leave and move on and I have a daughter and, oh my God, I love her so much. If you have kids, you understand, right? I have to, I have to get... I have to leave. I have to get out of here right now, I’m sorry, I just do, please let me leave. You don’t need me for this.” 

Eventually he started getting agitated and Cisco had to shout over her to shut her up until she was hyperventilating in silence again. 

Troy hadn’t tied us up or even forced us to lie down anything, so Shandra was still just sitting at the edge of the mats, and I was still beside the desk. Like I said, he actually let Cisco move around some, if he wasn’t sudden about it. 

Cisco’s overall goal was to keep the guy calm, but every so often he kept trying to bring the conversation back to what he wanted from Paolo, so we could start working on convincing him to let us go. The most specific he got was variations of “If Paolo gives it up we’ll be fine, it’ll be fine. But it’s time for me to be a man right now, because I’m done waiting.”

If we pressed him on what exactly he was wanted, it would only trigger a rage, because he’d interpret it as us questioning whether or not he should have it. Along the lines of “I WANT WHAT I’M OWED. DON’T TRY TO ACT LIKE I DON’T HAVE THIS FUCKING COMING, YOU KNOW HE’S BEEN HOLDING OUT ON ME.” 

We tried to get across that it was in his best interest to be specific in his demands because if it was money, we’d pay him. If it was drugs, Cisco probably had a hook up. If it was about a woman, Shandra would replace her. If it was something else, we’d figure out something else. Whatever it was, we were hoping once we knew we could start appealing to the molecule of rationale that was buried behind his decision making to begin negotiating a release. 

But trying to figure it out just made it worse, because he was frustrated that we didn’t already know. I had a sneaking that suspicion that, with the stress, pressure, and sudden burst of new information, he wasn’t even sure anymore, and that’s what was frustrating him. 

I tried to help where I could, but it was really all I could do to not curl up on the ground and hyperventilate along with Shandra. 

Worse, it turned out that was what Shandra did when she was relatively composed. Eventually, she spontaneously cracked under the pressure. She decided to see what would happen if she just tried to get up and sprint out. She very nearly got shot. 

Three things prevented her from being shot. First of all, when Troy pointed the weapon at her, she sat her ass back down on the ground where she stood. Second, Cisco instantly put himself between her and Troy when he realized the colossal mistake she was making. Third—

“FREEZE, POLICE. EVERYBODY DOWN. GET DOWN, GET DOWN, GET DOWN.” 

Those three calls earlier were not a complaining parent or telemarketer. It was the cops trying to make contact. When they couldn’t, they knew so little about the situation, that they eventually just decided to go in. 

To my knowledge, Cisco didn’t have any official record whatsoever. But I will say he knew exactly what would happen when the police came in with a specificity none of us did. He laid down exactly how they wanted him to. Was a step ahead of all of their directions. Maybe the only lighthearted part of this for me was holding that over his head after the dust settled. 

They cuffed all of us at first until they could determine who was perpetrating a crime and who was a victim of one. They subdued Troy with nothing more then pepper spray. (He dropped the gun when ordered but was still pretty worked up and resistant to being taken into custody.) 

Oh, LPT, if you think someone is going to be pepper sprayed, get the fuck away from them. That shit travels all through the air, even if it’s not directed anywhere near your face. And I was handcuffed when they sprayed him, so I couldn’t even cover my eyes with my shirt or anything. 

But, anyways, one of their tactical looking guys was helping us get uncuffed as they realized Troy was the only criminal and said, “Hold it, hold it, I only count three. Where’s the fourth? The caller reported a minimum of four victims, right?” 

I was stupid enough to just say, in my peppery post-hostage haze, “There was another girl...” They heard *was* and immediately went to the worst case scenario. 

They’d deduced who the bad guy was by this point so were cross checking their notes and getting in Troy’s face going “WHERE IS SHE? DAMN IT, WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? YOU TELL US RIGHT NOW OR GOD HELP ME—“ I composed myself enough to point towards the bathroom as it all came snapping back to me, because Troy couldn’t help them. He didn’t know even know what they were talking about. 

The police kicked the door down, and there was Alsace, huddled in a corner, just hysterical. It took everything she’d had to stay silent through the whole thing, not knowing if everyone was ok or what was going on. 

Alsace saved us. She’d painted “911” on the window. That’s why the cops came. One of our owners spotted the “911” right away when he pulled up (he lived almost directly across the street) and called the police, giving them all the pertinent information about who was likely to be there that day. 

The neighborhood had so much crime more sinister, targeted, and tragic than this that our ordeal didn’t get a whole lot of attention. 

Later that night three kids younger than Cisco were shot nearby in some gang thing and the one or two people who wanted to report on what happened over here dropped our story to cover that instead. 

But one of the responding police officers was so touched by Alsace’s quick thinking that he got his department to team up with his brother’s small business to give her a pretty healthy college  scholarship (within the context of the neighborhood’s socioeconomic means) to commend her for her bravery. 

It was the final straw for Shandra though. She went back to teaching on the other side of town within a couple weeks of this happening. Out of courtesy, she’d still do a few personal training sessions here and there, but even that stopped after while longer. I don’t blame her whatsoever, I don’t think anyone who was here for it does. 

Troy never clearly articulated exactly what he wanted from Paolo. We were never able to track Paolo down to ask if he even knew he owed Troy something or could lend any context. 

No one at work really talked about it much besides that. I mean, it was all anyone talked about for like, two days, but then everyone just moved on with their lives. 

I don’t know how they did, because it was the single most petrifying thing I’ve ever experienced. Cisco was even able to look back and laugh about it just a couple weeks later. But even though it’s been years now, I still can’t laugh about it. 

Not too long afterwards, I had to move, so left the job. I miss the kids, but I don’t miss the reality they were facing. Troy, let’s not meet.",23Sep2020,1
104,"So I'm kinda new to reddit, so if this post doesn't fit this subreddit, please tell me where I should post this, but for now I'll do this here since I think it's ok

.

I've seen old tumblr posts about Rasputin being the weirdest person ever and impossible to kill. Same thing for Adolf Sax, the inventor of the saxophone who had so many NDE it was incredible he even   
lived to see adulthood. But I just found someone somehow so bizzare and odd that I'm having a hard time believing he ever existed, and should have a movie made about him.

His name is Erik Satie. He was a famous french composer and pianist in the late 1800's, early 1900's, around the same time as Debussy for reference. If you're curious, Gymnopédie no.1 is his most famous piece. And as of today, I have no idea why people don't speak more about his person. Here is a list of facts about him:

&amp;#x200B;

\- He graduated music school at the age of 40.

\- He had a rigid schedule for his everyday life. Like, to the minute (ex: 7h58 to 8h46). His schedule included: sleeping (yes, he would wake up on command), being inspired, eating, horse-back riding, fencing, reflextion, immobility, visits, contemplation, dexterity, symphonic readings, and finally swimming.

\- He only ate food that was white. Nothing else. Like, he'd eat fruits only if they were moldy, that way they were white.

\- He slept with one eye closed. For real. Oh, he also had a hole in his bed for his head to go through (you figure that one out on your own).

\- He was always serious. If he laughed at any point, he would apologize to no end.

\- When he walked he would ""clasp his hands to his side, looking steadily behind him. Oh, and he was always walking with a hammer on him. The reason: ""just in case...""

\- He was called Mr.Poor, because he somehow wanted nothing with big gigs, so he made little money.

\- He proposed to his girlfriend... the very first day he met her. And for 6 months after that, they would only paint each other and sail toy boats (yes, toy boats, because why the hell not).

\- He considered his music as ""not music"", but rather experimental sound waves. He's sorta the inventor of furniture music (the type you'd hear when being put on hold on the phone, or music elevator). And that's not accidental: he created his ""music"" for that sole purpose.

\- He didn't want people to listen to his music. If he performed in public it would be at social events, and would tell people to just wander about and not look at him or his ochestra. But people would listen and applaud, and it would just make him angry and he'd start yelling at people.

\- He founded his own religion called Église Métropolitaine d’Art de Jésus Conducteur. He was, and stilll remains to this day, the sole member of that religion (you can start to see his delusion at this point).

\- He would troll his critics by creating outlandish pieces that made no sense, just to screw with them.

\- After his (somehow inevitable) divorce, he wrote what I can only assume is Hell as music: a piano piece called Vexations. It's one page long, is absolutely horrible to listen to (the melody is just terrible), but here's the kicker: that one page, which takes about 2 minutes to play only, has to be repeated 840 TIMES IN A ROW (I SHIT YOU NOT)! If that's not weird enough for you, the piece comes with a cryptic note which roughly translates to:

 *“In order to play the theme 840 times in succession, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, and in the deepest silence, through serious immobility.”*

\-  Lastly, you'd think that after his death, his eccentric behavior would leave with him, but I guess Satie was not a simple fricking man, no. His appartment hadn't been touched after his death, and when his relatives came to get his stuff (years later for some reason), they had trouble getting in the appartment. Why, you ask? Nothing really, except that there were HUNDREDS OF UMBRELLAS CRAMMED IN THAT TINY APPARTMENT, AMONGST OTHER WEIRD SHIT FOR SOME REASON.

&amp;#x200B;

Either this guy was a genius or a lunatic, because people still listen to his music today. I have so may questions still. But godbless this weird, weird human that somehow was a musician.",23Sep2020,1

She worked her ass off her whole life and beat cancer once before. She was one of the sweetest, most loving, courageous women I've ever known. She was the only grandparent I cared about having at my wedding and meeting my children one day.

What i feel is that everyone has different pov's regd. What success is and what they wish to do/fulfill before they die. 
For some  it might be happiness for some it might be money and for some it might be serving and helping others.
And none of them is wrong its just a different view towards life in general.

For me, i want to be a millionaire before 30.
I know it's pretty vague and many people have told me that its not possible and that i think too much, but i find this urge in me or this sense of self belief which is way stronger than any of those comments. Being a 17 year old the process of working hard enough to be a millionaire excites  me  as opposed to some of my friends who think it's too much hardwork as well as a daydream/fairytale story.

118,"I remember being the only white boy in a two mile radius, living out of a welfare motel on skid row. Paying my stay with the government vouchers. No ID, no bank account, not a dollar to my name. Nothing but a backpack full of clothes, my boots, a pack of cigarettes, and a toothbrush. Using face wash as shampoo in a communal bathroom. A little desk, a cot, and a thin sheet. Ten square feet in a windowless room, too hot to hear my own thoughts. Chaos in the concrete jungle. I think back on it and can’t help but smile. 

Hitting the pavement on the corner of 7th and San Julian, blinded by the sun. That summer, the heat was oppressive. Getting accosted by gangs because I looked so out of place with my skinny jeans and boots. Getting harassed by the police. Getting shit from the older, black corner boys. Getting cat called by the Mexicans on 17th. Attempted robbery. Chased. Threatened. ODing and waking up in an ambulance. Walking around the city blocks. Aimless. Looking for drugs. Looking for friends. Looking for fights. Finding them. Looking for a purpose. Looking for something, not knowing what, but knowing that I would never find it. Not here, not there, not as long as I was still myself. 

I sold my food stamps for dope which really turned things around for me. At least I could have a good time that way. I would spend my days drinking malt liquor with a convicted murderer until he disappeared one day. I would spend whole days in the library writing in my journal. I made one good friend, until something worse happened to him. I hope you’re still out there, James. I went to church for some reason. They gave me food. One day there was some group giving out hot dogs. I went back in line three times, I had never eaten anything so delicious. Eventually, I was forced out of my room and into a shelter. The rules were so strict, most nights I just stayed outside. Wandering. Looking for a friend. Hustling tourists for some spare cash. 

Eventually I sold the rest of my food stamps for a bus ticket up north to San Francisco. Where I had friends. Where I could pick up the pieces and break this cycle of insanity. And I did. I came back to my family. I traveled. I’ve worked job after job, gone to school. Fallen in love a few times, had my heart broken, I’ve had adventures. I’ve had a good life. I met someone different. It’s been 8 years since those days in downtown LA. 

Now I’m homeless again. But I live in a nice house. My home was with you. I always told you that. It’s something you told me many times. Sometimes we could only be together lying on blankets in the back of my car. Those nights, that car was home. If I sat with you on the beach, that beach was home. Home is where your head is on my chest and the rest of the world falls out of focus. Home is burying my face in your tummy and closing my eyes. I’ve never felt anything like that anywhere else. And I’ve touched a lot of tummies. 

You are my best friend, and the only thing I ever really cared about. The only thing I’m left with are the things you told me when you left. Things that I’m having a very hard time living with. Things that don’t reconcile with our memories. Our pictures. Our life we made together. How happy we were, every single day to have each other. To have something real, something different. I’m left with a feeling too horrible to deal with. Are you feeling it too? If you are, I want to take those feelings from you. I can’t sit still if I know you’re hurting. 

I’ve been making new friends. Talking to new people. I tried getting drunk with someone. I thought maybe that would be fun. What a mistake. They’re fucking awful. Like somehow anyone I meet is even more broken than I am. How is that even possible. I tried getting high with someone. It didn’t do very much for me, but it did pass the time. 

I just want to say I’m sorry. I miss you. I miss my best friend so much. If I hurt you, I’m sorry. If I made you feel guilty for leaving, I’m sorry. If our past made you feel uncomfortable, I’m so fucking sorry. I want you to be happy. I want you to go on and live the life you want. To do what makes you happy. Whatever and wherever that may be. I could never bring myself to hurt you. If I failed somewhere along the way, I’m so sorry. I just wish I could still be in your life. I always knew maybe we wouldn’t get married. Maybe something would change. But I always knew that you would be my best friend. That we would always have this beautiful thing. Something that no one else could understand. 

Don’t worry too much about me. I’ll be alright. Focus on yourself. Take care of yourself. I worry so much about you. But things will change. Time fucks all feelings after awhile. I might be in a bad place now, but it will get better because I will make sure that it does. Honestly, I don’t want to hurt myself. I know that if anything happened to me, I know how much that would hurt you. At least I think it would hurt you. I can’t hurt you. 

I just wanted to say I’m sorry. I love you. I miss you. I miss my best friend. I miss talking to you. I miss reading to you before you fall asleep, I miss telling you what you need to hear to feel loved and secure. But mostly, I just miss my best friend in the world. I miss having a home. But I’ve been homeless before. I’m great at comebacks. You’ll see me again someday and I’ll see that smile in your eyes. My door is always open. You can call me if you need a friend. I could never shut you out. I will always be here if you need me, when you need me. I will always love you.",23Sep2020,1
119,"The good thing about the pandemic is that I'm starting to eat more.

The bad news is that I'm gaining more weight. 

Growing up, I was always the skinny kid. I had been consistently under 100lbs from the age of 18 to 27 (now). I see my face in the mirror and I see hamster cheeks. I look at my arms and I see bingo wings. I look down and my stomach bulges out. Even my neck has extra fat like it's teasing me. 

The logical side of me knows that I've been scarily thin to the point where I look unwell. It doesn't stop me from eating, but I feel panicked that I might get fat.

Five years ago, I thought that I had it. Although, maybe that was induced by social anxiety more than weight control. I used to eat three cookies a day to avoid meeting people in the kitchen. I'd be lying if I said that it didn't feel good. I might have felt slightly pleased and lightheadedly delirious at myself for exercising self-control and only eating three cookies a day. 

I don't obsess about my weight all the time. Just perhaps two weeks in every month. It doesn't take over my life. It just worries me as my boyfriend confided that his mother is a recovered anorexic and he grew up watching her struggle with her weight and I don't want to put him through a repeat. Sometimes I catch myself talking about my body out loud and I realise that it hurts him to hear.

120,"My lovely grandma died 3 months ago. My grandfather died 3 weeks ago. I wanted to make a big investment in local mid-size business and make it big, but my money are gone. All that money was in realty, but cause of my fucked up father we had to spent all of that to cover his debts
Like this is not enough, my girlfriend, that I really loved for the first time in my life left me for another guy. Previously I lived only on the power of hate to all the other world, it was like a challenge to me like ""you think I gonna fail? Fuck you! I gonna make it success!"". She was the only person, who really cared about me and i cared about her. She replace all that hate in my heart with love and now I'm just empty inside
Her birthday was 3 days ago and I sent her my toybear, that was with me my entire life. It was just like sending important part of me. And no, I send it more than 2 weeks ago, so I just wanted to be sure so it'll be delivered on time. Today my friend send me her new photos from her birthday for some reason, where some new guy hugs her from her back and it reeaally punched me in my chest
I do not care about my own life or death. And never did. But now I really don't want to live. I don't think that I gonna do something bad to myself, but I reeeaally want to

Sorry for bad eng

Pls, I don't need ""there is a lot of fish in the ocean"", ""just try to work harder to forget about everything bad"" and so on. I just wanted to share this with someone",23Sep2020,1

123,"I guess I have plans for the winters. Ski instructing, but I havent even gotten there yet. 

But other than that I feel like I have no plans. I didnt go to university. Most of my mates are already on their 3rd year and I have just been working in retail and blowing all my money on shit. Yeah sure Im not getting myself into student loan debt but I’m not anywhere near qualified or experienced to work most jobs.

I feel kinda useless I guess? 
All I wanna do is be in the mountains skiing, even if most of it is work, I love helping people, and I have loads of experience skiing, but other than that I really have no ambitions and kinda feel like I dont really fit the criteria for someone who would be “successful”.

I kinda just loafed around for a few years, not knowing what to do with myself. Then again, I am just anxious a lot about how my life is gonna turn out.

124," Been using gaming as a way to deal with Covid, and recently picked up of Sea of Thieves on Steam. Have little to no idea what's going on and it's been a blast.

I've had this game for not even three days now and getting immersed in the pirate life and sailing the seas has honestly been a blast. Last night my friend and I had set out to see what the great seas had to offer, our barrels hefty and cannons loaded. We both noted a giant red skull in the sky and as keen, trained seamen we decided to go full tilt into the unknown.

And... a couple of sunken ships, a lot of burning bits (wood and non wood essentials) and some bullets from an eye of reach at a giant floating ethereal head later I could safely deduce we had zero clue what we had gotten ourselves into. On our last effort to try and figure out what in the world we were supposed to do (just because insanity is doing the same thing the same way but expecting different results doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a try) , we found ourselves doing the brinny swim once again. However, a galleon bearing full crew were attempting the Flameheart battle and gave us a 17th century lift.

As this new, far more competent, crew got to work it was clear to see we had much to learn on sea craft. It was almost like watching a well oiled machine, cannons when engaging in combat were fired in sequence leaving sparse windows without cracking booms of cannon fire. Swift and toiled effort as they scrambled about the ship to ensure everything was sailing; checking for holes attempting to drag the ship down, keeping a solid lookout out for the treasures of the open sea and ensuring the pirate way was done justice.

After only a few minutes I had gained much insight and the tiny map that was my brain began to account for the many ways I could improve my own sailing life. Thus, my friend and I as inept and slightly inebriated as we were, grabbed up arms and began our arc of piratehood. We manned cannons, we dove into to the sea for riches, we repaired gushing holes that threatened to drag us down and we did so all with a smile constantly teasing at the lips. On this day we bested Flameheart and built what felt like a new form of bond all under the hourglass red and black sail that they had.

And on this day did we indeed learn what it meant to be pirates. We were told the crew would offer us an alliance after the battle was done and sailed towards the Reaper's Holdout. As we drew closer, were met with a fate all too cruel but all so familiar as the crew that we had spent the last few hours with at sea, shot us dead where we stood. We both awoke on an island far away, staring out our ship map to see their ship slowly pull into the port of the holdout. A little sullen we began to gather material for another voyage, when an idea began to bloom. Well, we are pirates after all, so with our new found sailing skill we set out to get out piece.

We sailed after them, and before long they had finished selling their plunder and set out on another voyage. After riding through the tides we finally spotted them at an island and we pulled towards their ship as it sat in the water. On the seas it was quite easy to tell the importance of experience, for as soon as we got into cannon range they blasted our mast in two and set the ship ablaze. In some way, I suppose our ingenuity piqued their interest and they offered to take us to the holdout after assisting with repairs. Once there we formed an Alliance and got the cut we sought out and as this was the end of their voyage, they took down their flag as a parting token as they set off.

Honestly, this entire session was insanely fun so maybe next time you see a few landlubbers without their sea legs you could give them a shot.

Once again, my dark companion has taken my hand and is guiding me further into its realm. I am searching frantically for an exit off this dreary road until I am certain there are none for miles, and I am walking. Soon my worrying becomes a boulder of apathy as I let the emptiness wash over me. I've seen the sun shine here before. Maybe I'll have the chance to see it again, at least once more.",23Sep2020,1

137,"Today I watched a friend be taken into custody at the courthouse. He was actually trying to do the right thing today, to get back on track, to finally commit to the program and get clean. And to see him that way; scared and ashamed, wouldn't look at me. Just broke my heart into a thousand pieces.

And you know what? It would hurt so much less if I wasn't so painfully and acutely aware of all the things beyond his control that lead him here, to this. It is in that moment I realized just how little control anyone has over their life. That it's the illusion of control we cling so dearly to, so that we may not be so terrified of the world, that allows society to punish good people with impunity. If you don't have good, stable, safe, loving parents, then you probably don't have a safe, loving extended family. And if you don't have that, you probably don't have good child care providers, or quality schools. You don't have inspiring and high quality teachers. You won't have the care and support of your neighbors or your local law enforcement. It's all so very connected and everything that we are born into has such a vast control over who we become. And every decision we make is mostly, if not fully, influenced by what came before. And what came before we had no control over either. 

This boy was born good. He IS good. He just can't help that everyone in life has kicked him around, knocked him down, and taken advantage of him. And in the end, the only one who treated him good, made him feel ok, was the drugs. 

And that's the most infuriating thing about all this.",23Sep2020,1

For a good few years now Iv drank scotch whiskey every single night amounting to 20cl a night with Pepsi/Coca Cola (1 litre = 100cl) (some nights 25-30cl) withsome days I have a hangover some days I don’t.
Iv always looked tired and rough for years, pale and puffy face and it’s basically that I look hideous constantly. (I’m 6ft tall and weedy lanky type) and my nose is berg red and I have rosacea like symptoms too.
For 2 weeks now Iv gone from that 40% proof scotch to drinking 4% WKD irn bru. And a better sleep schedule too. I feel so much better but Facially like a 2% improvement that’s it. I’m clearer skinned a little definitely but my face is still larger and puffy around the jawline too.
I saw a young guy on Twitter post pic of 2 years ago when before he quit and was an alcoholic then and now since he stopped for 2 years he looked better like I was like ‘woah wtf!!!’ The difference was amazing. Then I thought ‘there’s my motivation’
It’s the only reason I have to stop it.
Will this in time make me look better and in how long does it take?",23Sep2020,2
