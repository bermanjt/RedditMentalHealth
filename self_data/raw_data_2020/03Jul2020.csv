1,"I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong place, but I just need somewhere to vent to. Today started out pretty bad. At my job we‚Äôre required to have a mask or we get paperwork. I forgot mine at home so first thing I had to do this morning was run to the store and buy one before I was almost late to work. From there, I missed something at work that almost resulted in getting someone killed. My job has had 2 deaths in the past 3 weeks worldwide due to similar issues. So my supervisors rightly screamed at and cussed me out before sending me to talk to the big boss, which then resulted in me getting permanent paperwork. This will affect future promotions, and possibly also make me lose tons of work hours. 

So I get home after being trash talked the rest of the day, and decide I‚Äôm in no mood to cook. So I order chipotle on Uber eats and go to get a smoothie from smoothie king. After I get my smoothie I sit down to wait for Uber, and proceed to spill that smoothie all over my nice end table. So I have to clean that up. 

Cue to about an hour after I ordered food, and I realize that no driver has taken my order. So my foods been sitting there for 45 minutes, and it‚Äôs cold. I can‚Äôt cancel unless I want to only get back $6 out of $26, and going there to pick it up myself is also a waste, since I paid all the fees to have it delivered. Basically, it‚Äôs 19:30 now, all I had today for food was 2 muffins at 6 for breakfast, and all I want to do is go to sleep and forget about all of today. But here I am on reddit whining to strangers. Cheers",03Jul2020,1
2,"Male) aged 30) 6ft tall) 160-163lbs) I‚Äôm naturally an ectomorph (tall and slim) (but now I have skinny fat vibes) 

6 months ago my face got fat and round af  (larger head size) and made me look skinnier as it was then out of proportion to my skinny fat  body (I have a severe pot belly too) but it went larger too. as I gained weight from 11.1 stone to 11.10 stone. Recently I went down to 11.5 again and jogged  and it made a little difference definitely but not anywhere as small as I want and I still have the pot belly and larger sized  head . It‚Äôs difficult to get below 11.4 stone event with fasting tbh so that‚Äôs the threshold. 

See Iv been jogging most nights in my garden and fasting as I said Iv lost around 5lbs give or take and I‚Äôd say only face is about 5% slimmer. I want it smaller like it was before last December. Last year in 2019 April it was larger then than it is now and I lost it in a few weeks of fasting no problem at all. This time Iv been at the jogging and fasting for 3 weeks and very little difference. I fast often  then eat late on evening is that better? When i do eat i are fried eggs and bacon on toast is that bad?

I drank a lot of water today and went up 4lbs from 11.4 stone to 11.8 is that normal?

I run 0.6 miles some nights  mainly in hot weather",03Jul2020,1

17,"Was born in Ny with a single mom raising two kids. me and my 6 year old sister. 
Never met my biological father and still don‚Äôt to this day.
My mother eventually met my step dad when i was only 4 so i consider him my father, stepped in when we needed him the most. 
Early early schooling was really hard. I struggled to make friends and enjoy school. Around 4-5 grade i started acting up. Now a little back story to that, i did not have the best childhood at all. Very very verbally and emotionally abusing mother. My sister and mother were like a pair, i felt always out to get me. I felt trapped in my head, so much i wanted to say and just nobody understood me because nobody would listen to me. As of me acting out my mother put me in counseling. it would always be my fault whenever we got in the office and what i would have to change. I would always say ‚Äúmom you have to change too‚Äù but she always had the same response ‚Äúi‚Äôll change when i see you doing it‚Äù. I knew at the time she wasn‚Äôt setting a good example for me and i figure now i was acting out for attention, even if it was bad at least it was something. 

Fast foward 9th grade summer, got kicked out of my house and had to live with my grandparents the entire summer. First summer i had freedom away from my parents and felt good. i enjoyed hanging out with the small friend group i had and it was great. 

by this point my sister had her first kid August 2018. she was moved out and has her own appointment with her boyfriend. even tho my sister was a complete assh*le to me i still love her regardless. and i miss her a lot. She‚Äôs living with this guy who just drinks and smokes and is just a big headed douchebag. she can do so much better than him and it sucks. 

As time went on we got further and further apart. i also became more depressed but kept it to myself. 2019 Junior year came around and the summer of 2019 i got introduced to Lsd. ate tabs like they were candy haha. it was great at first untill i started seeing in a new mindset. it really just highlighted my past and i now understand the reason i‚Äôve became depressed and have been at rock bottom.

Currently i‚Äôm 17 and i‚Äôm at a all time low. no friends, just starting a job thankfully, been depressed for a long time now and hopefully shit just gets better. Me and my mom have became much closer as i‚Äôve gotten older and sister moved out. we‚Äôve learned a lot about each other. 

Truth is. Life‚Äôs really hard, i wanna start a landscaping business and leave this life behind. Move to down south for sure where i can do landscaping full time. i have goals. i always find a goal for the day to say i‚Äôve done something. 

I now wake up everyday at 9:30 am, get sum air and enjoy the morning. Fighting depression and especially your past, ls very difficult, you can‚Äôt run but only face it.  Time heals.

18,"I‚Äôve always been the type of person who loves to educate myself on any and all topics. And lately, my friends have expressed that they are amazed by what I know.

I‚Äôve been thinking about starting like an Instagram page (similar to those DIY pages) to start informing people of some cool, educational, or you should know facts. For example, postpartum psychosis, but broken down into simple explanations, just so people who want to learn or are unaware of this can have that info.

I would be covering a lot of topics and my main goal is to reach out to people who like to learn anything, and possibly educate those who maybe knew about the subject, but don‚Äôt know the details.

Life will go well for about 4 days maximum, and then it‚Äôs another week minimum of feeling like this. I just don‚Äôt find actual happiness in anything, only distractions.

I can‚Äôt put my finger on it either, I thought it was ADHD (I got medicated for that recently) but as the dosages rise, nothing‚Äôs helped. I definitely feel better in other aspects of ADHD but that one part never leaves.

It‚Äôs like something‚Äôs just missing, I check my phone for it, look around my room, go on my computer, go to a friends house, talk with my family, play video games, write music, indulge my hobby, do some freelance work, and nothing‚Äôs worked for the past 2 years.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm looking for something, but nothing works. It comes and goes for sure, but it‚Äôs getting worse lately.

20,"    I ( 16f ) met this girl, H, ( also 16 ) when I was at a party at a mutual friend's house two years ago. Immediately i started crushing hard. She had blonde curly hair, and a smile that gave me butterflies.

    Yesterday, I asked her out on a date. I've been talking to her for about three days now, and I feel like I've known her for years. We fit together like a puzzle. It's strange.

    Personally, I believe in soulmates. She may, potentially, be mine. I'm excited to get to know her better, and have a day of fun. 

    We live about an hour and 20 minutes away from each other, so we decided to meet halfway. We're going swimming at this beautiful spot. It's a peninsula with a huge lake on the right side of the road, and Mike's of wood on the left. I'm so excited, and Tuesday couldn't come sooner.

    If we don't end up dating, at least I tried, right? I'm proud of myself for being honest with her about my feelings. Normally I wouldn't do such a thing, but nonetheless I'm grateful to the universe that it worked out well.

    It seems like a bit of a stretch, but my mom wants to introduce herself to her when she drops me off. ( I'm 16 with no license. ) I know for a fact that this is going to be awkward. But it's unavoidable, because of how paranoid my mom is. Maybe I'll meet her mom/dad, too? Who knows. I hope it isnt too awkward. Wish me luck, lads.

I get into arguments with him constantly, but he firmly believes that this whole pandemic is just drummed up by the media without any real danger to it. My mom and I can only hang our heads in shame and watch my dad parade around the town, flagrantly disobeying requests by stores and gyms to wear a mask.

He‚Äôs even pulled the ‚ÄúI cAn‚ÄôT wEaR a MaSk!!1!‚Äù card. He doesn‚Äôt have any sort of lung condition. He just asks the question in the hopes he can get his away around rules.

24,"Hey everybody,

Been in a relationship w/ my S/O but I have a desire to be single. We recently moved in together and have had excellent times. I just don‚Äôt understand where this feeling came from. 

We‚Äôve had some slight differences in long-term goals but they seem willing to make changes for me. Again, another reason why I don‚Äôt understand why I feel like this.

Up until this point I accepted my victimhood, my life as trash and as a slut who doesn't deserve respect.

But I started doing art again and I'm gaining a very small following. This spurred fear in me again. I'm not interested in being an influencer /artist just posting my art hoping to get work /commissions 

Should I quit posting my art online? How would you feel if you found out an artist you like had this past?

Should I preactively attack it by posting alot of NSFW work? I've always wanted to tell my story in art but maybe I'm not ready yet.

27,I am 18 years old female and I date a 14 year old female. We have agreed on having a long distance relationship since I‚Äôm going off to college soon and also playing basketball.

28,"I am a 17-year-old female who lives in the USA. I just spontaneously created this Reddit account in order to ask for advice. This is my first time actually on the Reddit site, so I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong, but I really just need an objective, anonymous perspective.

Recently, I have been having nihilistic and self-deprecating thoughts. I have dealt with these in the past, but usually only every once in a while. This time, it is constant, and it has been for at least two or three weeks. I keep questioning my value in life, the point of my existence, and the point of life as a whole. I am a Christian, so I know what the answer to all of those questions *should* be, but how the world works, I can't be sure of anything anymore. 

But the main reason I'm making this post is that, within the last three days, I have continually thought about suicide. As with my nihilism and self-deprecation, this isn't the first time, but this time it is more present in my day-to-day life. I keep thinking that death is the only logical solution. The only reason I can create that explains this train of thought is because of what's been going on recently. Just a bunch of little things I keep hearing about in the news that pile up and make me think, ""America is doomed. I have no future here.""

I want to be a high school English teacher after I graduate. Actually, I want to be a professional writer, but English teacher is a more (and I use the word ""more"" in the loosest sense) financially stable career. I literally cannot see myself doing anything other than writing and reading for a living, or share my passion for reading and writing with the next generation. And before this year, I was content with both those ideas.

But every day, I see my envisioned future being destroyed before my eyes. By the time I can actually teach, I won't be able to teach children how to use their brains, how to critically think, how to use their mind, heart, and soul to create and inspire. I won't be able to write anything without it being deemed ""racist"", ""sexist"", etc, for some inexplicable reasons. I see the world I was so ready to become a part of becoming a place so full of corruption, violence, stupidity, and blind acceptance, that I genuinely believe the world is too far gone for anyone except God Himself to fix, and even then I can only see a true fix possible with Christ's Second Coming, it's looking so bad.

So why bother staying. It's just a bunch of worthless pain and suffering. There's no point.

I haven't told anyone about these thoughts; you all are the first. My mom knows about some of my depression, but she doesn't know about the recent suicidal thoughts. I'm scared to tell people in my life because I don't want to be a burden to people. When my mom found out about the first (and tamest) depression thoughts (on accident), it broke her heart. Telling her I keep envisioning ways of killing myself will destroy her.

So my question is this: what should I do?

TL;DR: I may be suicidal, but I don't want to tell people in my life. What do I do?

Thank you for your time.",03Jul2020,1
29,"Not sure if this is the right place to put this but I‚Äôm having a quarter life crisis lol. This is basically just going to be a long rant into the void so thank you if you stick around to read. 

I‚Äôm 21, I feel like I‚Äôm living a life that a different person planned. I‚Äôve changed in more ways than I‚Äôm even able to explain since I was 17 and put down the $500 deposit for college. Spiritually, to my core, in my soul I am different based on some incredible and amazing experiences I‚Äôve had over the past few years traveling and seeing the world. I don‚Äôt hate my major, or even my school, but if I knew who I would be now back then I probably would‚Äôve done things entirely different. I know a lot of people feel that way but god it sucks. The worst part though, is I have such a desire to totally reinvent myself but I can‚Äôt. 

I haven‚Äôt been able to go shopping for new clothes in years, maybe I‚Äôll get a new shirt or two every so often or an outfit for a special occasion but that‚Äôs about it. Working part time jobs I really haven‚Äôt had the money to buy myself new clothes and I don‚Äôt want to ask my parents for even a little bit of help, even though I know they would, because I hate asking them to spend money on me. All of my clothes I have now are basically remnants from high school, a pile of t shirts I‚Äôve gotten for free through clubs and school activities, and the handful of new clothes I‚Äôve acquired. I sold a bunch of my old clothes to consignment stores for some extra cash when I needed it but I‚Äôm still left with things I don‚Äôt want to wear. I know this doesn‚Äôt seem like that big of a deal, but my style is completely different not to mention how all my clothes are very juvenile since they‚Äôre leftover from high school. So now I basically wake up every morning and throw on a t shirt and leggings and call it a day. It sucks. I want to dress in nice jeans and cute shirts but the only ones I own were purchased by a different me. 

I hate where I live, only problem is I don‚Äôt know where I even want to go. I live in a town where people here are basically in a bubble. It‚Äôs roughly one square mile and I think there‚Äôs maybe three families of color that live in the entire town. There‚Äôs four churches and only one elementary school to give you an idea of what it‚Äôs like here. It‚Äôs ignorant, it‚Äôs close minded, it‚Äôs awful. Small town Facebook groups are quite possibly the worst thing I‚Äôve ever seen, people complain about anything and everything because they have nothing better to do. The only reason I stay in it is so I can get updates on the weekly farmers market and other events that I like to attend. I have a desire to go far, somewhere where I can be totally different and pretend the life I used to have never happened. If I had it my way, I would escape to a small village in Iceland or something and live in a tiny little cottage with a small garden where I grow all my own food and sell flowers and jam at a stand in town. I just want to live a simple life, a life free of people who worry and care about the most irrelevant things, a life free of so many of the burdens of living a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù American life. I hope to be able to work enough that in a few years I‚Äôll be able to buy an RV and take a year to just drive around the United States and see and experience new things with my dog and my boyfriend. 

I‚Äôve wanted to start an online business selling items from my hobby for quite some time, I have basically everything planned. I could start it tomorrow if I had the money. Unfortunately, like so many, COVID hit me hard. As a college student I typically work a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job during my winter and summer breaks while doing small things on the side through the semester to have some spare spending money. I quit my seasonal job this past January because I thought I would be moving across the country to do a dream internship, but my school canceled the program due to the virus. It‚Äôs so hard to find a job, I‚Äôm delivering for DoorDash just to try to keep up with my basic expenses. I‚Äôm fortunate to not have many since I‚Äôm living with my parents right now and they cover my absolute essentials (pretty much just food). I have a dog, so most of my money goes to him. Because of where I live DoorDash isn‚Äôt all too busy so I really don‚Äôt average that much money per week so I basically make enough to cover my dogs needs and keep a few spare dollars in my account ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù His recent vet bills hit me hard so I‚Äôm currently working on paying off a couple hundred dollars of credit card debt, it‚Äôs nothing wild and I‚Äôll be able to pay it off soon but man it still sucks. 

I‚Äôm graduating early, next semester is my last and I only have to take three classes and then I‚Äôm done. I was previously excited about the fact that I worked my ass off to graduate early as a double major, but now with so many things about the future up in the air due to the virus, I‚Äôm absolutely dreading it. I was supposed to get an internship, live on the other side of the country for the summer, get a better idea of where I want to work, come back and finish my last couple of classes, get a job (I‚Äôm in a field where before COVID there were plenty of job opportunities basically anywhere I could want to live but now the opportunities are slim to none due to work from home), move somewhere else, and start my life. I don‚Äôt think any of that is going to happen in that way anymore. 

I know I‚Äôm probably going through what a lot of people my age go through but I still hate it. I‚Äôve cried every night for the past few weeks. It sucks knowing the kind of life you want, and knowing what you need to get it, but having blocks that make you close to it but not close enough, almost there but not quite. I don‚Äôt feel like me. I don‚Äôt feel like the life I‚Äôm living lines up with the person I am in my heart. By August I should be out of the red and back in the green, I‚Äôm hoping that by then I‚Äôll be able to start doing more to point myself in the direction I want to be. 

If you made it this far, thank you for listening to me complain, I appreciate your time. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to read this but I just need to let it off my chest. I‚Äôve told my boyfriend about my feelings, but his best advice was to just ‚Äúhustle and one day you‚Äôll be able to do it‚Äù which of course I know that but that doesn‚Äôt change how I feel currently. I don‚Äôt want to bring it up to my dad (I‚Äôm not close with my mom) because I don‚Äôt want him to feel any sort of guilt or obligation to help me financially. 

Anyway, you‚Äôve made it to the end of my post, thanks for sticking around. Wishing you all the peace and love the universe has to offer.",03Jul2020,1
30,"This shit is getting out of hand.

I went to my nearest Qdoba today and observed the staff with masks worn improperly (on mouth but not nose). Three out of four of the customers behind me were doing the same.


Instead of standing there waiting for the obviously new employee (one of the two I saw) to deal with rolling a burrito painfully slowly, while feeling surprise and disgust, I went from first in line to out the door in a heartbeat.

As I was getting in my car, I noticed the only other properly masked person in the restaurant behind me walking out.

I spent the last 5 year going back and forth with the babymama .. about a year ago we became so close !!! Like sisters she would say. Long story short I only had one year with her she was battling cancer for 2 years and lost her battle 06.28.20 at 30 years old. I'm taking this alot harder then I thought I would.  She became my bestfriend. Her dad wrote me a few days ago he told me he promised her he would tell me how she really felt about me. She adored me !! She loved our friendship she was so happy god brought us together after all these years and after everything we been through!! I lost my mom when I was 5 to cancer. She was 30 as well. I see so many similarities it was so scary üíîüíî same same. Same age. They resembled each other !! Idk what all this means but idk what I'm looking for I'm just so heartbroken!! I watched my husband break down and cry while he sat next to his BM bed while he was saying his last goodbyes.. I won't EVER take that away from him. He has the right to grief, he has the right to feel sadness and emotions. This is the woman that gave him 4 beautiful babies. Of course he has a right to feel the way he does....",03Jul2020,1

I've been quarantining since March, full quarantine since May.  Meaning only go outside for walks around the neighborhood or park, everything delivered, groceries, food, then sanitize and microwave.  I still remember the sheer panic at the start, going to the market and buying frozen food, seeing it packed, everyone with forced smiles and bad jokes, seeing everything gone, then hoping some online outlet would have the item, stressed because I have a baby's life to look after now.  

Now it's like living in a permanent war zone that's occupied by the virus.  I worry about friends and family, some are in healthcare and have their own families to worry about.  My mom and aunt have preexisting health conditions.  My parent's business is failing because there's no shoppers.

38,"I don't even know why I applied to one of the best colleges in the world. Things just clicked together and it all came together to this moment. 

**What's the background?**

I applied to the University of Toronto to compete in a scholarship with the top 3 students of my class. I was the only one interested. When applying, I was hesitant doing it. I wasn't even expecting to earn the scholarship. I had already been accepted into my local college. It's a good university (around 120 in the world), and Biomedical Engineering is a mayor I did want to pursue.

The counselor at my school scared me a little bit. He spoke to me about a girl who went to that college for a couple of years and dropped out because she was under too much stress. She was directly exposed to the effects of mental illness and a really heavy environment. 

I submitted the paperwork at the last second in a kind of risky move. It even mentioned sending SAT scores, which I didn't take. The months went by and I just thought I had been rejected. Today, I was cleaning up my email and found the notice. I thought it would be of rejection. I was accepted. I didn't earn the scholarship, but I'm still in. They have a fairly large acceptance rate though. 

*The tuition fees for international students, however, are too expensive. The thing is, my family is willing to make many sacrifices and we might be able to pul it off. So now the question is: do I have the will to do it?*

**What about me?**

I selected the degree because I wasn't to change the world, even if it's only the world closest to me. I'm an 18 year old high school graduate in Mexico. I've always been almost at the top of my class. I entered a ""gifted program"" in elementary and middle school. I've been to international MUNs. I have even helped organized some myself. 

I excel at classes like mathematics and programming. I do not believe myself to be the smartest (I'm really bad at many things I do, such as video games, drawing, or even just learning and memorizing). I do think I might have some creativity. I have been able to solve mathematical problems very quickly and precisely. 

Last year, I worked on an amazing project where I used a Kinect to hand track motion and convert it to a MIDI output for Ableton. I enjoy many of these things. I have vision and I'm able to convey it. I'm also quite good at designing and video-making. I thought about making a career out of them, but I think it'd take the fun away and it wouldn't be as influential as the potential that research and physical creation (engineering) has. I would like to create new ways for people to express themselves. Art has evolved because of technology, and I want to transcend art and create the technology that allows us to dream. 

**So what now?**

The director of my school spoke personally to me this year. My friends had been telling me this for a while. There was nothing I owned. I was the second-in-command in this last MUN. They told me I would've won if I'd made the proposal by myself. I had the second-best grades in my class and couldn't be valedictorian.  I was vice-president of NHS and the projects just didn't come from myself. 

Sometimes, I feel like I'm wasting my time. I've done amazing things, and right now, I find it hard to get inspiration for a specific project. I want to do something with my time, I just don't want to die slowly killing time. I find it hard to believe in something specific. I guess I just want to keep learning.

*Should I own it now?* If I make the decision to say I will go to the University of Toronto, I will have chosen knowledge. I will choose an abstract field of science where my creativity may take me long ways. I will, however, also choose to give up many things. Will I be able to express myself as I do now so confidently and comfortably? Will I have enough skill? Will I be able to make something that is mine? 

I'll have to leave everything behind to go to a new country. I will have to work very hard from now on. Work every summer to save money to pay off college. Right now, my family would have to sell a lot of property to pay off, and even then, it's a risky move. I will have to study and try my hardest. I don't if I have the skill for this. I don't know if I'll have the motivation to move on and just study day and night. To overcome the despair and sadness of not being able to understand, of not being the best. I do have a dream I strive for, but is it worth this much sacrifice?

TL;DR: Clean up your email, you might find yourself having to make a life-changing decision.",03Jul2020,1

41,"TW/ sexual assault

this was both of our first times watching this movie. i grew up with my brother, but now we‚Äôre older and he lives with his girlfriend. i was there visiting and we watched that movie together. the scene where Betty, as her younger self, was raped by Roy in her childhood home was very uncomfortable to watch with him. 

when we were younger and still living with our no-good mom, she kept a lot of shitty people around. she had a friend who everyone called ‚Äúklepto‚Äù who always told me he wanted to marry me. he was in his mid 40s, i was only 5. one day my shitty ass mother left him to watch me while she went off to get high. my brother was at his friends place, really close by. he didn‚Äôt know klepto was the one who was watching me. 

my moms friend molested me. he tried to rape me. my brother came home to grab something and went in my room to check on me to see this man on top of me in my bed. we haven‚Äôt talked about it since it happened. my mom denies it ever happens, granted she probably doesn‚Äôt remember because of how fucked off she was. 

seeing that scene really changed the atmosphere the rest of the night i was with my brother. we were having lighthearted conversation before that, but then it got quiet. i left soon after that. we never spoke anything about it. i know he thought about it the same way i did. i feel different with him now. when i left, he hugged me and told me he loved me. it‚Äôs never the way it was this time though. usually it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbye, love you‚Äù but this time it was a long hug and he said ‚Äúi love you, be safe.‚Äù 

even though it‚Äôs unspoken, i feel like he tried to tell me i‚Äôll be okay. it just felt so weird to almost relive what happened with him present. i think about what happened to me a lot, but i‚Äôve never thought about how that impacted him. i didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd even remember, but that moment made me realize he does. we buried it so deep into our relationship and i never thought it would come up again.

45,"I am trying very hard to balance many perspectives here, but I am struggling to arrive an answer.

There are several phrases that all suggest the same thing: look inward to see if you are the problem. Phrases like ""the common denominator of a relationship"" or ""if you smell shit everywhere then check underneath your own shoe"". To that end, I have tried my best to overcome my own shortcomings, reflect on my missteps, and follow-through in areas of improvement. I am hasty, imposing, exacting, and more. Over the years I have gone to great lengths to address these issues; identify them and subdue or re-orient them. That said, I am only human and still come up short sometimes. But I am also kind, generous, and sincere.

But what complicates things is that all of my significant romantic relationships (more than three months long) featured some sort of abuse or misuse, complicating the theme of those phrases that perhaps I am the problem. The first relationship occurred when I was 14 or 15 with a man in his mid 20s, who sexually abused me and exploited my lack of sexual knowledge (I had a delayed sexual awakening; I didn't even know how to masturbate until I was 18), touching me in ways I didn't understand. My second relationship was with my ex husband who physically, emotionally, and financially abused me. He choked me, threatened me, humiliated me, and was ultimately arrested. My third and final relationship was with an initially charming man whose promises and affection induced me into being my most vulnerable, which he then took advantage of, only to betray those promises and dismiss me after I was no longer useful to him.

So, before all the lockdown and stuff happened I was going through a very hard time. I wasn't mentally there, I used to love my studies and gaming but for past few months I could not get into either. Then one day, I read an article about self discovery and it had some good points. I lost the article but one thing that stuck with me is that it said, ""when you can't do anything that you like, do what you actually like."" And that basically gave me a new perspective to things. I realised that part of me that I haven't fully explored yet. So after thinking about it a lot, I opened my own cooking channel. I have posted only two videos and response has been good for a new channel. I post videos on it every Monday and Thursday and it has already affected me in a good way.

67,"So, like I said, I dropped out of high school at 16. I was getting bullied at school and I was constantly going home crying. Walking home 2 miles after I ran out of class because something dumb someone said to me. I went to a pretty much all white school, and I am biracial (black and white). It subjected me to a lot of bullying. My curly hair getting made fun of constantly. My skin being made fun of. The fact that my parents were separated being made fun of. My body. My smile, everything was the target of this bullying. So I started skipping school a lot. It was just hard to be in such a place. I didn‚Äôt have many friends and the friends I did have were horrible to me. And people
would point that out. People would make fun of the fact that I ‚Äúhad two friends and even they barely liked me‚Äù. It was hard. I couldn‚Äôt do it. So I left and refused to go back. I was an honors student. I was so smart and I thought colleges were going to be jumping at me someday. But now I‚Äôm here. For the last two years I haven‚Äôt done much. I‚Äôve been depressed. Very depressed. Just have sat home and watched on social media as the people that made my life hard, thrived. I gained a lot of weight. I‚Äôve lost 30 lbs within the last few months though. But now that I‚Äôve seen the people that put me through hell graduating, I have never felt so angry and envious. I want to fix my
life. I want to go to a good college. I want everything to be normal. But I can‚Äôt go back to public school. I just can‚Äôt. It‚Äôd be humiliating. I can‚Äôt afford to do one of those online diploma programs where I could earn it quickly. I feel stuck. But I want to fix my life. Where do I even begin? How do I fix this horrible mess I‚Äôve gotten myself into? I know the bullies aren‚Äôt responsible for me dropping out, I did that myself and it‚Äôs no ones fault but mine.

68,"I grew up in the early 90s around the end of the infamous Escobar Cartel and the many drug cartels that spawned after his death. I saw a lot of the worst in humanity and was told that this was the only option for a boy like me, growing up in Bogot√°. I began drug running and committing petty theft when I was 11 (I think) and as I got older the crimes got more major, which I won‚Äôt go into the specifics of. 

When I was 24 I was tired of seeing friends, innocents and police‚Äôs lives ruined by the drugs, murder and violence. I have moved to a quiet town out in the Colombian hills where I work as a ranch hand. I‚Äôm often asked by people to tell them stories of what I‚Äôve seen and done, which I prefer not to but I understand the interest and do. I often find myself repeating the phrase, ‚ÄúI had to do what I had to do to get by,‚Äù meaning this was my only way to make sufficient amounts of money to live off of. 

This has made me think about the way I viewed life, I was a very money-hungry person and still am in many ways, as I‚Äôm sure a lot of people are. This is because we are taught to go to University and get a degree and get a well paid job so you can have more freedom in life. This means that whilst we are living in a very capitalist, ‚Äúget to the top‚Äù society, we are taught that money is the goal in life.

In the past, humans may have been coming back from hunting with a dead rabbit saying I didn‚Äôt want to kill the cute little guy but ‚ÄúI have to do what I had to do to get by,‚Äù but this logic has changed because we no longer have to hunt and live primitively where the object in life is survival, we can just go to the supermarket. This means our time has been taken up by work in return for currency so we can buy the food rather than hunt it ourselves.

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is, even if we aren‚Äôt told it, we all know sub-consciously (because we have all been told it at some point by a parent or carer) that the meaning of life has changed from, ‚Äúyou need to survive!‚Äù To ‚Äúyou need to make money!‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think that this is an amazing realisation but i thought it was a good brain exercise for me to go from ‚ÄúI had to do what I had to do to get by.‚Äù To the meaning of life and I wanted to share it. Thank you for reading.

But today I didn't want to do anything but lay in my bed and overthink which gave me a bit of a migraine. I feel like my interests in things are fading away slowly and I feel more lonlier than usual.

The most consistent advice that I've gotten to help cope with the crushing loneliness that I've been facing has been to focus on my hobbies and spend time doing things that I enjoy. The problem is that none of my hobbies can really be done from home - all of them require going out to places that are closed right now due to social distancing.

I've tried looking into new hobbies as well, but again, everything that interests me would require going out, and almost everything is closed. I am pretty much completely broke right now and can't really get into any hobbies that involve buying anything, either. With the pandemic going on, I really cannot do anything that I like to do.

79,"As a kid, I used to be very smart for my age. I used to get straight A's without breaking a sweat, I was good at writing stories, I was good at drawing, I was good at sports, etc...I basically had no weak points at all. I was basically close to invincible. 

However, as I got older things unfortunately didn't stay like that...

Very bizarrely, it seemed that my skills didn't develop at all as I got older. So let's say I was good for the standards of an 8 year old...being good for the standards of an 8 year old is not gonna be good for the standards of a 10 year old, because the standards of a 10 year old are just higher. 

And as you get even older than 10...having the standards of an 8 year old is eventually gonna become absolutely abysmal when compared to your actual age, especially when you reach like age 15 or so. And that's basically what happened to me. 

You may think I'm exaggerating, but no...I'm 18, turning 19 this month, and literally am gonna start my 8th grade year in August. People my age are usually seniors, and a lot are even in college, but here I am, still in fucking middle school. 

And the worst part about it, I don't have a mental illness or anything. I'm just incredibly stupid and have a lot of trouble focusing/concentrating on things, no matter how hard I try. And I can never get things to sink into my brain for some reason. 

This doesn't extend to just education though. For some reason I just can't take a hint and end up pissing everybody off, and losing the few friends I do have. My family hates me too and makes fun of me. And I can't blame them, because I'm the 18 year old still in 8th grade. 

I also can rarely ever pass the first level of any video game I play. And my stories look like a little kid wrote them. And my drawings look like a little kid drew them. And I absolutely suck at any sports I try out. 

I don't get how I used to be so great, but eventually just became a joke that's not funny. 

\---

**TL;DR- As a kid I was basically good at everything, but my skills literally didn't develop as I got older, and now I'm an 18 year old who's gonna be starting his 8th grade year. I used to be so great, now I'm just a joke that's not funny.**",03Jul2020,1

Sorry for the formatting. I‚Äôm on mobile. 

My dad died when I was 10 years old. For most of my childhood, he was sick. He had gotten cancer several times and had a failed transplant which ultimately lead to his death. Today is his 11 year death anniversary and I wanted to share a dream I had that gave me some closure. This dream happened sometime last year.


The dream:
I was in some sort of table store browsing. The store had many windows causing natural light to fill the room. I was walking around and suddenly on a table next to me, pictures of my childhood started appearing. They had my dad in them, as well as my little sister and I. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile as the memories of those picture came flooding in. When I put the pictures down and looked up, my dad was standing there. The natural light from the windows outlined him as if he were an angel. We hugged for what seemed like forever and he said he was sorry for leaving us. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to apologize for anything and we kept hugging. I could even smell him. It felt so real and warm. 


When I woke up, I was the happiest I had ever felt after a dream. I had seen my dad‚Äôs health deteriorating throughout my childhood and I knew his death was inevitable. My mom never hid the situation from my little sister and I because she wanted us to be completely aware. What bothered me is that I had never gotten a chance to say a proper goodbye. We buried his ashes but that never felt like a goodbye to me. I wish I could‚Äôve hugged him in his last moments and told him how much I loved him. This dream gave that to me.",03Jul2020,1

I had a talk with them and my sister's to give them 4 tools to keep in mind to help them improve their emotional maturity.

(People have been messaging me asking to post this somewhere they can see it, if this doesn't work for this sub please let me know!)

\---------------------

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. Communication (SSAM)

* Safe Place (make sure before you talk about an issue or anything that it's a safe place, you can reafirm your love, reassure that you're not attacking, make sure they know you heard what they said, etc)
* Say (express what you need, want, feel, etc)
* Ask (ask for what they expect, what they need, what they want, how they feel, etc)
* Moderate (have a neutral person to help moderate a conversation if you guys have a disagreement and keep going in circles)

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Emotions (VAFU)

* Valid (all emotions are valid, there is always a reason why you feel that way and the fact that you're feeling this emotion means it's real. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise)
* Awareness (be aware that sometimes emotions can influence your actions, try to not let this emotion dictate how you act, try not to act on a way that can hurt you or others like scream, hit, yell, etc)
* Feel (have a moment to feel your emotion, let yourself be sad or angry, don't bury this hurt or emotion down. It'll build up and explode or cause you unnecessary pain. You can cry or scream in a pillow, you can write them down, you can talk to someone, find a healthy outlet)
* Understand (try to figure out what caused you to feel this way, maybe it was something mundane but a lot of little things built up, or maybe it's a chemical imbalance, maybe it's a memory, maybe it's something about the future, figure out what caused you to feel this way and start working on the next step)

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Change

* Be aware that there are only 2 things you can change, external things and internal. If something is bothering you, making you sad, angry, stressed, etc, if there is something you want to change)

1. External: Find out if there is anything you can do. If you can, do it.
2. Internal: If there is nothing you can do, then it is out of your control and the only thing you can change is your mindset.

* For example: let's say you're stressed about a test, you can study for it, so you study so that you can do well and you'll be less stressed. Now the test is over, what can you do? You can ask to do extra work to make up for what you think might be a bad test, or if the teacher says there's nothing you can do, it means it's out of your hands, you're stressing yourself out for no reason and just causing yourself unnecessary pain so try to change your mindset by distracting yourself, or maybe you need to improve so you study for the next test, or you need to vent to someone, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

# 4. Intention

* Be aware that people tend to judge others by their actions and themselves by their intentions. This includes you. You know your intention but you don't know others, so you judge their action without thinking about their intentions. Keep this in mind and it'll help you be more understanding. For example, a guy cutting the line is a bad move, but his intention is not to hurt you or make everyone wait longer, he's just in a rush because he'll miss his flight because his car broke down.

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------

&amp;#x200B;

I think everyone would benefit from these 4 things.

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally a few tools I know that can help regulate and bring you down from your emotions are:

&amp;#x200B;

# Breathe for Four

* You inhale for 4 seconds, hold for another 4, exhale in 4. This helps you control your breathing and regulate oxygen and calm you down.

&amp;#x200B;

# Point and Describe

* You point out random items in the room naming each individual object. You can describe the colour or the texture or any other sensation. The goal is to get you out of your emotions and to bring you to the physical world. Aim for 4 or more.

&amp;#x200B;

# Repetitive Routine

* Actions with repetitive motions help you calm down, this can be colouring, working out, drawing, laundry, cleaning, running, etc. It helps you feel in control and let's you focus on a movement instead of the emotion.

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------

&amp;#x200B;

Some things you should pay attention to on your own behaviour as well as others you interact with:

&amp;#x200B;

# Manipulation

* Emotional manipulation is often learned from parents and it's when you use something against someone to get your way. A common one I've experienced from parents is a simple ""if you loved me you would do X"" this is using someone's love you you against them. You are showing them that their love is s currency you can use, thus not being actual caring love.

&amp;#x200B;

# Passive Aggressive Behaviour

* Often the preferred route for those that hate confrontation. For example the television is loud and you're working so you say ""isn't the television a bit loud?"" often times you'll either be ignored or the TV watcher will begrudgingly lower the volume and be annoyed by you. Instead you should say ""hey, the television is loud and I need to work because I have a call, could you lower the volume please?"" Here you are stating what is bothering you, what you need, and letting them know directly what they can do. Be direct.

&amp;#x200B;

# Dismissing Others

* There are many ways people can feel dismissed. It can be:

1. Emotional: you are sad and confide to someone about it. Instead of listening to you they say ""hey there is someone else that has it wise, be happy"". That's messed up, that's like punching someone in the face then stabbing another and telling them ""hey you can't be mad at me or feel pain from the punch, I just stabbed that guy over there so you can't complain"". Both People feel the pain.
2. Effort: often after you work hard on something someone you talk to about it can dismiss what you accomplished by attributing your effort to some other external factor. From a religious upbringing I can say that my parents would often dismiss my sister from her hard work and studying by saying something along the lines of ""praise be to god for blessing our daughter with the high grade"" or ""for blessing her with an intelligent brain"" in both cases you're taking away from their effort and giving it to your god. For none religious people you could be hit by ""wow you're so lucky"" or ""yeah that teacher grades really easily"" or ""yeah your tutor did a great job teaching you"" or any other external factor that detracts from what you've accomplished.

&amp;#x200B;

# Unhealthy View on Relationships

* Often in media we see a form of ""you complete me"" and this is a horrible way to see a relationship. An ideal healthy relationship are 2 individual people who are happy on their own and bring extra happiness to each other. You are not 2 cups half full that together fill up 1 cup. You should be 2 full cups that when together overflow the other. You need to learn to be happy on your own and content with being alone before you can be in a happy relationship.
* Additionally some days you won't be 100% happy, maybe you had a bad day at work so you're 80% so you can't do the dishes even though it's your chosen chore. Your significant other will understand this and pick up your slack and give you 10% so you're both 90%. They'll do the dishes today because they understand your situation. Now if you were both 2 cups that are only full when together? You'll be 30% and they will have to sacrifice a lot to bring you both to only 40%!
* Boundaries are important in a relationship and you need to communicate what yours are. Having them isn't a form of distrust or lack of complete love. It means you understand yourself and love yourself and the other person enough to set boundaries that will help you be happy. Example: don't touch my food I put in the fridge, but feel free to ask me and I'll let you know if you can have some.
* Love languages: each person has a way they want to be shown love and affection and a way that often express their own love and care. There are 5 major love languages and you should take a test to figure yours out. Often you want to be loved the way you express love, but each person is different and often this can lead to both people feeling unloved when they are just not realizing the way their significant other is expressing their love. Example: I enjoy physical contact, hugs, kisses so I'll do that for my SO because that's what I enjoy. They on the other hand enjoy words of affirmation, saying how good they look on their outfit, congratulating them on their hard work, saying how much I love them so she tell me all these things because that's how she expresses her love. Now I won't get loved because she isn't kissing me before we leave for work, instead she tells me to have a great day and that she'll miss me. She won't feel loved because instead of telling her how incredible she looks I'm just hugging her from behind while she's changing. Knowing each others love language allows us to adjust to each other. She'll know that I want to be kissed before work and I'll know she wants to hear me say I love you more. I highly recommend taking the test with your SO and going through each others preferred language. It's fun! It's also useful for any relationship, from family to friends! (You have many different languages, you might just have a preference)
* Google ""5lovelanguages"" for the test.

# Listen and Heard

* People listen to change and suggestions if there is evidence to support their argument. Lead with example and remember you can't force anyone to do anything, in the end you're trying to help them understand what you mean so that they can use it to better themselves.
* To help the other person know they are being heard and that you understand them is to clarify and re-say what they told you. ""Okay, so from what I hear you think ABC and you mean XYZ. Is that correct?""
* Can't stress this enough, people want to feel heard when you talk, make sure you're actively listening to their points and opinions. It's okay if you disagree!

&amp;#x200B;

# Control

* You literally cannot control how other people act or react to what you do or say, you are only in control of yourself and no one else can take that away from you.
* Even small things can take a toll on your emotional health, but you should remember that your actions are your own and you have to deal with the consequences of it. For example, you are having a discussion with someone but you're getting emotional and can't handle the conversation and need a break. You can choose to tell them this and leave, affirming your love for them but stating your boundary that you need space for an hour or so to understand your emotions. Here you are prioritizing your emotional and mental health where you deem more important than the conversation. The opposite can also happen, the conversation is in regards to how someone is treating someone you love and care for (perhaps your mother's toxic traits towards your younger sibling) and while you could leave because your mental health is important, you decide that the priority this time is the conversation over yourself. (obviously these can vary and it's up to you to decide what to do).

103,"I just need to get this off my chest.

Corona completely obliterated my firs year of college, and I've been holding onto the hope that things will go back to normal. That I'd get my sophomore year.

Nope. My school secretly moved all our classes online last night and is charging $100 extra now that they're non face-to-face. So I'll be paying rent and extra tuition for classes I could take at home.

So, I stay home, right? Nope!

My dumb school made only 1 of my 7 degree-required classes this semester in-person. So I can't even stay home and save money. 

I just want the college experience. I want to live with my best friend and go to class and see my boyfriend every day. 

I feel so much rage and anger towards all the precautions against COVID, which is stupid because I know they work. But I hate that my school is gonna make money off of us students by making singular classes in person. They are profiting off a pandemic. Fuck this.

104,"So, I had a boyfriend who lied to me that he is already separated with his wife. Later on, I found out it wasn't true and his wife and their family has been harassing me for MONTHSSS now. A friend/co worker intervene and explained to the woman that her husband was the one who has been pursuing me ever since. The harassment stopped for a while but out of nowhere, now I am getting messages from the woman again. She sent me SCREENSHOTS of me in a video while I was being intimate with my ex.

I NEVER GAVE ANY CONSENT for these videos to be filmed. I have caught my ex trying to film me quite a few times and I always got angry and asked him to delete them. He sometimes even showed me that he already deleted them but now, I found out those weren't true.

I am infuriated now because they are trying to blackmail me and would honestly appreciate any advice from you. It's been days since they started harassing me again and all those days I couldn't even count how many times I wished to myself that I just die.

July 4th is hot, and muggy, and there‚Äôs mosquitos. Also, it doesn‚Äôt get dark until 9:30 pm which reduces the optimal firework display window. 

However, January 4th is not hot. It is not muggy. There are no mosquitos, and it gets dark at like 5:00, so you can shoot fireworks off for four hours and still be in bed by 9:30. Also, January sucks, so adding a holiday in there would spice things up for people with seasonal depression. Not to mention the prospect of shooting fireworks off while it‚Äôs snowing.

117,"So everyone is getting wrestless and eager to return to normalcy, especially for those who are in the summer months, but the numbers that create panic with covid do not stop rising, and in some places, exponentially. 
Many of us carry too much pride to admit that maybe we could all help end this thing faster if we would just find some humility. We ask the military to swear to defend our lives and our way of life, but it is insulting how we as a people do not care about the lives of our countrymen. The general position that ""so what if I get covid, I am not going to wear a mask or distance myself"" is that very slap in the face. It is the responsibility of each person to protect the lives of others and if we want to end this thing quickly, there is an easy solution, but everyone who has even an iota of a conscience needs to be on board. Wearing a mask is uncomfortable and hot, but if we all did it for even two small weeks or even a month, we wouldn't have to be asking the questions about how we will return to school in the fall or when things will get back to normal. The numbers will drop significantly and we will sooner return to that coveted normalcy. Anybody up for that??? Just put forth the effort to do your part. I was also skeptical at first...I wanted numbers to prove that masks are worth while. Studies have been done and they protect from 95% of particles 1000x smaller, so, can you take one for the team and help drop these numbers?

122,"Backstory: I (guy) became best friends with a girl (we‚Äôll call her Lauren) in freshman year of high school a few years ago. We were seated next to each other in a science class, and I even still now remember the butterflies I had when asking for her phone number. We talked everyday, and bonded over sports, music, food, politics - seemed like everything. She was the first girl I became close with. We were both low-key people - introverts when it came to larger groups and in school, but were able to easily open up with each other.

In our senior year of high school, we weren‚Äôt in any classes together, and were both so busy and didn‚Äôt get many chances to catch up. We sort of drifted apart our senior year - not because of anything happening in particular, but because of crazy schedules, work, and worrying about college applications and post high-school life. Lauren‚Äôs best friend (we‚Äôll refer to her as Daniella), who I befriended because of my friendship with Lauren, was in my last period class, and we‚Äôd often walk towards the parking lot and talk after school. So, I became closer friends with Daniella, and sort of drifted apart from Lauren during the course of our senior year.

Fast forward to the end of high school - to the time of prom. This is where the TIFU part happens. Lauren and I barely talked throughout our senior year, but when we did catch up talking about graduation/prom, I (impulsively, without really thinking too much into it beforehand) asked Lauren whether or not anyone was taking Daniella to prom. So, I asked my once best friend if her best friend had a prom date. Lauren said Daniella did have a date, but it turned out that Lauren didn‚Äôt. And, after talking to a friend of mine who knows people in the two girls‚Äôs friend group, Lauren had wanted to go with me and was vocal about it to her friends, and was expecting me to ask her (word spreads quickly, especially among high school kids). When you talk to someone long enough, you can sort of read their expressions and emotions through texts, and I still feel the disappointment in Lauren‚Äôs texts to tell me that Daniella already did have a date. I already knew I had messed up in the moment, and wished I hadn‚Äôt impulsively done what I did. Without any facts or information at all, I just assumed that Lauren already had a date. Lauren eventually asked a brother of a friend of hers to go at the last minute.

Though this happened 5-6 years ago, I still can‚Äôt fathom why I did what I did. I guess, in the moment, being stressed from having to move away and start college, I wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly. I decided to post this and get it out of my system because I recently had a clear and vivid dream, where Lauren and I were still great friends. Eating one of her favorite foods that she introduced to me, crab cakes, and chilling by the beach. It wasn‚Äôt a sexual dream of any sort at all, but I remember feeling happy just having the chance to still know her and consider her my friend. Losing a friend hurts, but what hurts me more now is knowing the WTF that I must have made her feel.

We haven‚Äôt talked in 5 years, since high school ended, but today I felt the urge to reach out to her to see how things were going, especially now during a pandemic. But I feel like it would be too strange for me to reach out, especially with it being 5+ years since we‚Äôve talked. Knowing that she‚Äôs most likely doing great (she was always really bright, hardworking, and smart, and I admittedly did a little stalking on LinkedIn) puts my conscience at ease, but this recent dream of mine made me think of her again, and the friendship that I essentially threw away. I just wanted to get this out of my system (had only told 1 person ever since), so thank you for reading this if you‚Äôve gotten this far!",03Jul2020,3

It‚Äôs not even the ‚Äúnon existent‚Äù button tho remember the iPhone 6? They switched out the physical home button and replaced it with the one that didn‚Äôt click.

At minimum they could‚Äôve used the newest home button BUT

iPad mini, iPhone X design with no bezels, especially the swiping up/down motions instead of the home button would be been amazing 

Then to take a step further they could‚Äôve had a glass back :)

Basically my bones are very fragile due to a defective gene that makes the collagen in my body a bad quality one.

So i suffered over 50 Broken Bones in my life, had 7 Surgeries to repair the damage in my legs, was able to walk for a few months, and then everyone went to hell; don't want to make a huge post, just saying that i'm bound to a wheelchair for life.

Before i started University, i sent my Doctors to hell, and never came back (still hate them till today) finished my studies, became a lawyer, and this year i was about to move out and live by myself, but this corona delayed everything.

I have only a handfull of friends, but i prefer it that way; i have been backstabbed many times by people i trusted; from people that once i wasn't usefull to them ditched me, to literal treason.

130,"I was looking for a subreddit I can share my good news. I can't find one. I found this instead. 

I'm not exactly feeling happy but I think this counts as good news.

I was anxious about money. I thought I will never be able to work, make money or have a way to have a future after my first business. But I am starting to realize I will probably be okay.

- I can replicate my first business. If I can do that, I will be able to retire anywhere.

- I can work as a software engineer, remotely or otherwise. I can work in tech hubs of US or other countries. I can be an employee or contractor.

- I can probably improve my trading skills. Without knowing what I'm doing I made 40k this year, after blowing up 100k which was profit.

- Not sure but I might be able to build an algotrader which should solve my money problem indefinitely.

- I can do design and branding.

- I can be a therapist maybe.

- I can work as a professor if I get that desperate. (I hate school)

- I can make money from a hobby group.

These would take 1000s of hours but I can do them. I don't think I have to worry about my future. I will be fine. I just need to stop being anxious so I can do something, then I need to do it long enough, and no more money problem.

135,"With all that is happening in my country (or around the world, I just happen to be from the US)‚Äîincluding the BLM movement, COVID-19, the upcoming election‚Äîthere is an idea I embrace that shapes how I view the world and its people.  Divisive events magnify this idea for me.  It is the idea that has led me to a Master‚Äôs in human services and counseling, working with the dying in hospice, work in a psychiatric crisis unit, a detox unit, and doing legal work for indigents.  It is the idea that leads me to view nobody as a stranger.  It is an idea I want to share because I believe that with practice it can improve everybody‚Äôs existence.

In life, humans must constantly make decisions, choosing between options.  *There are an infinite number of variables that change the way these options **appear** to each person*.  These variables affect everyone‚Äôs perception of their options.  Even with the exact same options, they will not appear the same to different people.  This is vital to keep in mind.  People try to make the best choices to fulfill their needs, with the information they have in that moment, *and through the lens of their brain‚Äîa lens, you will see, they do not choose*.

Here is an example: ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt have to dropout and sell drugs.  He had the option to go to school and work hard just like everybody else!  That‚Äôs what I did!‚Äù  To simplify, let‚Äôs say Option A is to stay in school and Option B is to dropout and sell drugs.  To somebody whose brain made certain connections and pathways based on genetics/biological factors/their environment/and so on, Option B may present itself as a more feasible/realistic/helpful/plausible/or appealing choice than Option A.  This person has both options like others but based on a connections in their brain Option B is the choice their mind pulls towards.  *Options‚Äô appeal do not present equally to humans*.  I believe this goes infinitely deeper.  Let‚Äôs say that somebody argues, ‚ÄúThat may be true, but part of why so-and-so chose Option B is because they damaged their brain when they chose to use drugs‚Äù (there are a million similar arguments).  Again, I believe that you could break that decision up into Options A and B.  The same with working to improve your mind, by, say, learning through reading or counseling or exercise or any number of items.  The decision and drive to read for knowledge‚ÄîOption A, vs. the decision not to do so‚ÄîOption B.  You can see how these options and decisions create a snowball effect that continues to shape the connections and pathways in the mind.  A brain must decide if it wants to change itself.  *Not through the lens of somebody else‚Äôs mind, but through its own lens*.  I understand this is simplified, but I strongly believe that keeping this in mind when viewing other people is incredibly powerful.  Not just for humanity, but for your own sanity and evolution.  *Keep in mind that your brain is no different*.  It will keep you humble, open-minded, and more accepting.

This idea continues to be reinforced in my mind.  An example is that my sister writes mitigation reports for those charged with murder(s) and facing the death penalty.  Time and time again, she completes mitigation reports for these defendants.  And time and time again, similar backgrounds appear.  *This is no coincidence.  These connections made (or never made) in the brain are determined by events caused by the connections that were currently in the brain at that time, that were made because of previous events that occurred because of the connections in the brain at that time, and so on.*

If the above is true, then it is extra disheartening and discouraging to see so many people dehumanized around the world. Divisive events amplify this.  Take the BLM movement for example.  Many are dehumanizing the black community.  Many are dehumanizing the police, dehumanizing protestors, dehumanizing business owners, dehumanizing anybody who does not strictly agree with their side.  Sometimes done consciously, but many times unconsciously.  (Arguments can be made about how to prioritize which dehumanization needs addressing urgently‚ÄîI would say likely the dehumanization that is ending with peoples‚Äô death, but this does not change the idea that guides me).  A human, flawed as we all are, is behind every viewpoint or opinion, and the lens of their brain tells them they have good reason to feel this way, to meet their basic needs.  

It is easy for my mind to react with anger and want the harshest punishment for an (ex) officer like Chauvin.  After time to process, I can look through the lens of what I‚Äôve laid out above.  I use Chauvin as an example because I feel like he is one that many (most?) people feel the strongest negative emotions about as a human right now.  *I keep in mind that a mitigation report could be written about any human*, including Chauvin.  While what he did was obviously atrociously wrong (it seems that close to everybody at least agrees on this), *there were connections and pathways that were formed that made him feel like he was making the right decision with the information he had at that time*.  Some might say, ‚ÄúYeah!  That asshole wanted to feel powerful!  And he was racist!‚Äù  I ask, why were those the options he felt were correct at that time?  If he is racist, what led to those connections in his brain?  What basic needs are those fulfilling for him?  He is human.  I think this viewpoint allows me to feel physically sick about what happened to George Floyd, and at the same time to feel sad for Chauvin.  He is a human.  He may be scared or confused right now.  He may even feel justified and angry and like he did nothing wrong (but keep in mind why).  *I choose Chavin as my example because I believe if this can be applied to the most extreme, then it can be applied to anybody on this Earth.*  

During my time spent working on a psychiatric crisis unit, I recall hearing staff say about many patients, ‚ÄúThis guy/girl is a real asshole.‚Äù  One example was a man that was loudly racist/sexist/violent.  I remember a medical professional laughing with another staff member that this ‚Äúasshole‚Äù patient had to wear a diaper.  I discovered in speaking with him that he wore a diaper because of permanent injury he suffered from a beating his father gave him when he was a child.  Can you imagine the connections made or not made in this patient‚Äôs mind?  Can you imagine how these connections (or lack of) shaped how his mind evolved‚Äîwhich shaped how his viewpoints and behavior evolved and how his options look through his brain‚Äôs lens?  The defensive and safety mechanisms that formed?  *Everybody‚Äôs mind does this.*

Everybody is human.  *Everybody‚Äôs brain/mind is shaped by events that were out of their control and continued to be shaped by options they chose based on those connections, which reinforces more connections and pathways*.  A Nazi was once a baby, whose mind began construction in the womb.  I can love the human in a Nazi while feeling furious with their views, *and that which led to their views*.  I do not have to accept their views to accept their humanity and treat them accordingly.  Humans can change, but it takes time and compassion, an open-mind and acceptance, and **empathy**.  It takes showing alternative ways of meeting needs.  It takes working through lots of fear.  Views will always be easier or harder for a human to change based on their lens.  Ultimately, the most powerful and effective form of change does not come from guilt or threat or shame, but rather a change from compassion and understanding, where the individual wants to change.  I think this is important to keep in mind with any divisive topic.  It‚Äôs why I rarely think violence is the answer (think no other choice but self-defense).  It‚Äôs why I never think dehumanizing is the answer.  Urgent change can be made in any issue without dehumanizing and by addressing what needs are being fulfilled and the fear behind it, and the change will be far more effective.

Find the human in each and every person.  The police officer.  The black person.  The white person.  The terrorist.  Trump.  The protester.  Biden.  The business owner.  It‚Äôs there, and it will strip away the extremely negative emotions tied to them that hold us back from real progress.",03Jul2020,1
137,"I've (28m) never really had to break up with anyone of my dating relationships. Most of the time I get broken up with. But today I broke up a 2.5 year relationship. I felt bad about it all but I just couldn't trust her anymore. I had convinced myself that she was messing around with one of my buddies, mutual friends. I never had any solid evidence but there was incidents where I couldn't deny it. 
1. I was meeting a group of friends, I didn't even know she was gonna be there. I walk into the bar find the group and there she was kind of holding his hand. I didn't think about it to much then but I definitely saw that
2. We shared our locations on snapchat, one night my buddy went missing for the night after we were out. She was home i presumed; looked at her location and turns out she had blocked me for the night. I woke up the next morning and asked where she had gone, she stuttered a bit but then mentioned that one of our other friends (female) had gone over to my missing buddy's house and my gf didn't want to deal with her drunk calling. she always called my gf for rides after drunk nights. I dismissed it 
3. Another time I was having a fight with her. We weren't talking for the weekend. I had made plans with one of my other buddies to go to the bar. We met up and then decided to run to another bar. We get to said bar and my other buddy (the sancho) is sitting there, and guess who walks into the bar, yup my gf. She then tells me that my body (the sancho) had told her I was gonna be there. Conveniently not mad at me anymore. 
 What this taught me is that either I'm too insecure for a relationship, or she really just wanted to hurt me. It took me so long to accept that I needed to break up with her. I was having anxiety attacks and sleepless nights thinking she might be out messing around",03Jul2020,1
