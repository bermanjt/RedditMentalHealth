0,"it’s my 2 year anniversary of getting assaulted, i wish he would’ve just killed me

hey, tw for rape ahead

two years ago i was dealing with a messy breakup. i got my own apartment, one just for myself, and decided to celebrate by having a guy over. he was a regular at my coffee shop and i felt like i knew him well enough. being recently single i thought it would be nice to have some company in my new home. 

he brought over a bottle of jim beam, and at the time, i wasn’t much of a drinker. i was only 20 and he was 30+. it was exciting having someone so old and handsome interested in me. i drank the same amount he did, both to calm my nerves and to come off as a “cool girl.”

we watched it’s always sunny and as we got more drunk, he told me about his ex wife and what a bitch she was. i was getting tired and wanted to go to bed, i was feeling sick from the booze and wanted to be alone. i overestimated myself and was feeling uncomfortable. he seemed really drunk and i didn’t want him to drive home, so i offered him a spot on my twin bed. 

i woke up to him inside me. i’m not going to go into detail from here. 

i went and got a rape kit the next morning. the nurses documented the broken blood vessels on my face and neck, bruises all over, and tearing inside my vagina. they scooped out his semen. the detective assigned to me seemed really empathetic and kind. i answered all of his questions. i hadn’t even really decided to prosecute, it seemed like the choice was made for me once i went into the hospital. i was mostly worried about STDs and pregnancy and the injuries i had sustained. 

the detective said he needed to download my phone in order to get the messages my rapist had sent me on snapchat. he had messaged me after he left saying “i destroyed you, i’m so sorry” which i thought would be surefire evidence to his guilt and attested to my unwillingness to the encounter. 

the next time i saw the detective, he asked me to explain some nudes i had taken earlier in the day of the rape. i was confused. i didn’t send them to him or anyone. he asked me to explain “camming.” i am a camgirl but i keep that private. i never told my rapist or anyone else besides my best friend for that manner. i was so confused. i guess it’s worth noting this happened in a very conservative town with a high mormon/lds population. mormons are very keen on sexual purity. i would be an outlier. 

i started to be painted as some kind of whore who deserved it. the detective seemed less and less convinced my story was true, even though it never changed and my therapist backed me up on every statement i made. about a month after i reported it, the detective let me know via phone call that they met with my rapist, and due to statements he had made, they will not be escalating my case to a judge. all i remember is crying and crying to the detective asking why. why all my physical evidence and unchanging story and snapchat messages from him admitting guilt and backing me up wasn’t enough. he didn’t have an answer and said nothing will be done unless new evidence comes up or he does it to someone else. i cried harder that day than i ever had in my life. i blacked out at one point. the only reason i felt ok about pressing charges was thinking that maybe i would prevent this from happening to another girl. now that wouldn’t even be the case. 

my rapist continued to come through my coffee shop, asking my coworkers where i had been (i took a week off after being raped) and when i was coming back. i asked management to ban him and they never did. for the months i worked there following the rape i had to strategize with my coworkers to avoid him. 

and that was that. i tried doing EMDR therapy for the PTSD for a year but it didn’t help. 

my life is ruined. i moved across the country to get away. i’ve been trying to go back to college but i can’t. i feel so disconnected and scared and depressed and hopeless. 

i truly wish he would have just killed me after he was done with me. my life hasn’t been the same since and will never be. all i can do now is smoke so much weed i don’t feel like i’m in my body or drink until i black out. which is often. 

it’s hard not to kill myself on days like this. i have three dogs that depend on me and i wonder if they can tell they’re the only reason i’m still here.",02Aug2020,1
2,"12:41am i have online church in the morning (lol). I can’t sleep. I’m a 20M, one more year left at uni and quite frankly i’m not sure what i’m doing with my life, i feel empty. Am i depressed? i don’t know maybe. This is just a rant because i don’t have anyone to talk to really. My life is okay. I have lots of siblings so i’m constantly around people when i’m home but i still feel alone, like i don’t know where life is taking me. I’m in a relationship and i’m not sure if i’m happy or it’s one of those phases of a relationship where you supposedly hit a brick wall and you don’t really feel anything but i think i’m still in love (am i settling?fuck me). I just wanna disappear and focus on me but i don’t know how. I deactivated instagram for a few week and i activated today and i didn’t miss it. I went on a deleting spree on my phone. I don’t know if you can see what i mean. My thoughts are jumbled i don’t even know if what i’m typing is making sense, it feels like i’m writing some fictional story lol. I want to focus on myself but i feel like there’s so much that’s in my way. I think i wanna end my relationship but for some reason i’m scared she’ll ‘expose’ me. For what? i have no idea. Maybe i’m just afraid of letting her go. I want to delete social medias but at the same time i don’t wanna miss out on the ‘fun’  permanently. I wish i could just block everything and everyone out. I guess i’m just wanting any advice or tips you know? all that good stuff. Thanks for listening/reading.",02Aug2020,1

4,"Recently this has been on my mind a bit. 

So back in elementary I was pretty much the black sheep of the house. I was really depressed so I didn’t care about grades. I literally had zero ambition, didn’t. Even know what I wanted to do 

At the time my brother was in high school. All As, AP classes, massively high SAT score etc. he applied all over and got accepted into Harvard or some other Ivy League university. 

He went to community college in the same city we lived in. Reasoning was “to save money” and yeah. After that he went to college in the next city over. Got his bachelors and talked about going over to New York or something far away place for his masters. 

What’s he up to now? He pretty much works at a daycare having a bachelors. Not saying it’s bad or anything but compared to the ambitions he had back in HS.. doesn’t seem like he’s gonna get a masters for now, he’s definitely not going anywhere tho 

Me on the other hand I joined the military at 19. I had 3 years worth of college under my belt at the time. My plan is to get out and get a BBA and eventually take it up to an MBA. I will definitely NOT be going back to my hometown or anywhere near. Can’t imagine living a short car ride away from my parents or the place I grew up in. 

Another thing that changed is he used to be massively popular in high school. He’d be out and about 20 hours a day out of 24h lmao. Ever since going to college everything went down significantly and now that he’s been out he pretty much only has 2 close friends and from time to time talks to his best friend from high school. Me on the other hand I was the opposite and turned into the opposite 

Kinda funny and depressing how life plays out. Makes me wonder where I’ll be 5 years from now.",02Aug2020,1
5,"I am only 22 and it feels like I have wasted all my life, since my surgery I am just standing here, letting the waves of depression wash over me, as I look out at the sky, thinking back to all the opportunities I could've had, all the paths I could've walked. 

I can't move anymore, I am stuck in the past, I am stuck in my head and yet, I am so far from myself, that I don't feel like I am actually in my body anymore.

So tired and exhausted with it all, but I cannot, constantly waking up, getting up after 3-6 hours, exhausted from all the same dreams.

I am stuck and my mind is screaming to get out, but I can't.",02Aug2020,1
6,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.


Edit: she started saying the ‘awwwww’ a few months before when saying bye ever since I failed an interview she chose me for for not having enough confidence :/ she was really annoyed at me for it even tho she filled out the application form for me for it too",02Aug2020,1
7,"I’m a lot like Burr (sir). I don’t usually want to tell people too much about my thoughts or feelings on any particular topic because I don’t want people to have that as ammunition against me later. Reddit is the place where I get to say what I need to say. But lately I’ve been realizing that waiting for people to change is stupid and I’m going to have to be silent forever. I wonder if that even makes me a unique person. Like, if a brilliant idea is conceived in someone’s brain but is never shared with others, is it still brilliance or is it like a fictional take on the environment? 

This is a problem because I tend to run into a lot of problems at work. I’m a 26F in a female dominated profession. If I don’t share or speak during our daily meetings, my bosses flag me for disinterest or insubordination. I get pulled into meetings with people asking me if I really care since they don’t hear me contribute daily. But when I do speak up in the meetings, my coworkers (all female, not a “men are mean” thing) shut me down and either make fun of me or ask me to stay quiet. It’s not just at work either. In public, if I were to talk (I would never do that unless asked a direct question that was like small talk) or have a problem and ask for help, people would film me and call me a Karen. But if I don’t ask for help or stand up for what I believe in, people say I’m complicit in all the social wrongdoings in the US. And online! If I don’t post anything I’m a weird recluse and I should reach out to my family and friends more, but if I were to post pics or statuses (also don’t do that) I would be self centered or a bitch. 

So what’s even the fucking point of living and trying if nobody wants to let you exist anyway?",02Aug2020,1

11,"What comes of it? I don't see any personal gain coming from it. Is there just some kind of sadistic pleasure that comes from telling someone that your friend can bench press a car with all the honesty in the world only to allow that friend to show up in that someone's life and disappoint? Is it done in order to intentionally enforce a pre-instated lack of interest?

""Oh boy, oh boy! It will be awesome to meet this person!""

Only for them to meet you and be disappointed enough to never want to actually learn who you are?

I honestly want to know because this has happened to me between someone telling other I know how to actually play the guitar and telling them I'm rich when my father just spends his money on relatively expensive-looking things that nobody ever actually cares about so they assume they are for rich people.

There are more examples, but you should understand the point I'm trying to make.

None of the lies have helped me. They have all been damaging to me unless I kept them up somehow. Did these people expect me to force myself into money, or learn to play the guitar? I know I've said that I own a guitar and I've also said I own a drum set. None of the times I've done that have I said I know how to play anything.

This world, this internet... it's a place built on falsehoods and assumptions. Right now my father is actually using quite a bit of the money I rightfully earn to purchase his toys so even that is a misrepresentation. He's sold as many houses as he has inherited so that is a misrepresentation as well. We are not rich.

I am far from it as I am on social security disability, but I have had people tell others that I have money and that I have toys when all the toys belong to my father and all the money, including what should be mine according to my country's laws belong to him as well.

What benefit are all the lies? Someone tell me because I don't understand.",02Aug2020,1

14,"She’s been really crazy for the past two years about my sister’s and my hair. I wanted to cut it really short two years ago but my mom said no, and that I couldn’t cut my hair until after graduation (mind you this was 2018 and my graduation wasn’t until 2020). And that I’d regret cutting it then, and having ugly hair for graduation. 

After graduation was canceled, I wanted to shave my head, or at least get a super short pixie cut. My hair has been super long my entire life, and I wanted and really needed a change. My mom said no, that my hair was too pretty and I shouldn’t do anything.

I made the argument that she had cut her hair super short before, she said “well my hair is different ( she’s black and has super coil-y hair, while I’m mixed and have curly hair) and you have the ‘good’ hair” so I couldn’t cut it. Later she said that my hair was fine and I shouldn’t change it. 

Anytime she saw me she’d say “oh your hair is so cute just the way it is” trying to fucking manipulate me into not doing anything with my hair. Recently my sister really wanted to dye her hair and my mom said” no, your hair is beautiful and you shouldn’t do anything to it.” Like what the fuck?

17,"For as long as I can remember, I have hated my legs. Even when I was thinner, my legs held a lot of cellulite. That coupled with growing up in a conservative household that allowed no leg to be shown above the knee grew within me an immense hatred for my legs and how they looked.

Even when I was working out daily, keeping my weight down, going for runs and overall being pretty healthy as a teen, I had ugly ass legs that I hated and refused to show off, and on the stage occasion I tried on a short skirt or shorts, I was immediately shot down with the ""you aren't leaving the house like that"" response.

This year I began getting tattoos on my legs, and with every tattoo I get I grow a desire to show off my legs and show everyone the ink I'm so proud of having on my body. They make me feel beautiful, for the first time in a very long time.

I'm no longer a twig and I still have cellulite, which is expected. I still work out but my body refuses to adjust to any specific shape that I want, and no matter what I do I have a tummy and a lumpy butt. But I'm learning to stop hating myself over it and just fucking enjoy life! I've battled eating disorders and self harm my entire life because I never felt beautiful or thin.

28,"Hi reddit,

I've had a long standing fear of putting myself on social media, and am usually extremely conscious of someone's likes/if it's interesting and am aware of how there is still some implicit idea of someone being more valued if they have more likes - eg being popular/productive... I know this is something people think of as really superficial numbers, but I do feel really embarrassed to put anything at all/or don't even put things up at all because I'm conscious of how it comes across to normies. Most enlightened and kind folks next to me would tell me that oh nobody cares about all these, but they've all already had a phase of exploring themselves on social media and getting lots of likes when they were younger... However on top of it all I really do want to post more about my art/my life, I'm starting to realise that it's a highly valuable tool for documenting my life (so many memories and connections kinda faded because of my fear) but really need some help in getting over this fear...maybe it's also about me living through a phase for my ego that I think could help me to finally overcome all of these... 

Just some dominant thoughts that I don't know how to shed:

1. Really afraid to upload photos of friends, I don't really have a persistent squad (kinda lost my longest group of friends this year because we outgrew each other.), and am afraid to post up photos of my mostly newer friends for fear of people thinking that I'm kinda lame to not have long-standing friends, or uploading photos of people who'd never do the same in return/uploading photos of friends who already have their own squad, that I would seem really desperate for friends on social media 

2. Kinda want the likes of normies, but interesting content don't go really far with them... But I'm so envious of how many peeps could harness so many likes from simple posts. I'm a third culture kid from southeast Asia, and the amount of likes that sometimes go to really simple posts here is insane, and I wish I had a large community from a specific country/scene that could support my social media posts (think china/India groups that pile on the likes for one of their own members) 

3. I really would like more friends (recently lost a group of friends during covid lockdown due to some confrontations) and partner has highly recommended social media visibility to me because she made many friends that way, but I don't really know how to do this. My fear of putting anything up stops that for me, and I can't make new friends this way too. 

4. I am starting a lot of passion projects which I would love to acquire more followers for... But I'm not sure if mixing life/my art under an account is good. In a way since I'd like to make more creative friends, I suppose mixing the two could be interesting. 

5. I take really long to post something, always thinking of how I could perfect it better at home (maybe a photo I could enhance in PS etc), but the procrastination and the fear means it's never put up and I get further delayed in these goals...

6. It was my birthday recently and only 4 people wished me on FB and it kinda stang, I removed it from my timeline immediately because I thought it'd make me look kinda sad. But I think it's also because I'm hardly there that most of my birthday wishes came through texts and calls instead. 

As you can see, a lot of it is my toxic cycle I can't get out of. I'd like more friends and validation on social media but the fear of it keeps me really locked to being only an observer. Thank you for reading!",02Aug2020,1

30,"I hate everyone and everything. I wish every single human being could die, none of us deserve to be here. Everyone is self motivated, greedy, and mostly stupid. We've constructed a society that only rewards greed, billionaires are our Gods and we're expected to bow down and worship them as such.



People hate and kill each other over politics when neither fucking party gives two shits. The real divide always has been and always will be rich and poor but we're bred to say that thinking that is communism and that's the devil incarnate. The CEOs and corporations who murder, abuse, exploit, and destroy the planet so they can sit on a pile of gold are Gods, but your neighbor who thinks Healthcare is a right is the devil and deserves to die.



Most of all everyone's fucking ok with this. As long as they can get their fast food and watch their TV and scroll Facebook then there isn't a problem. Climate change bringing the literal apocalypse, corporations running the world, our elections being fake, nobody gives a shit it's all normal. And no change can ever happen anyway. Even if everyone banded together (would never happen) it doesn't fucking matter because money is power in our world and the rich have it, they make change impossible.



I didn't ask to fucking be born but now I'm stuck in a miserable world of suffering, I have to work, pay bills, taxes, more bills, more work, more taxes whole Bezos can sit on his ass on his throne, pay fucking dirt nothing in taxes and play the world like a video game.





But I can absolutely never under any circumstances EVER ever *never* kill myself no matter what. Nobody has any reason why. The bullshit cliché phrases aren't it. Face it the only reason we discourage suicide so much is because then we lose a laborer. A cog falls out of the capitalist machine. That's fucking it, fewer bills paid if I kill myself. No other reason why society frowns upon it so much even though suicide is EXTREMELY FUCKING REASONABLE AND SANE. 




I hate my parents, the rest of my family, my coworkers, my ""friends,"" everyone I've ever met, everyone on Earth. I want to burn it all down. Fuck humanity, fuck society, we failed. That's it. We had time to experiment and we fucked it up so far beyond comprehension or repair. Nothing about being is good unless you're 1. Mega rich or 2. Have your head up your ass and ignore it. Buy into the propaganda that ""Life is a gift :) the world is beautiful &lt;3:) please have babies :))))) [not so we can have more soldiers and laborers but because you NEED a baby :))))))]""





I wish I could kill everyone, all almost 8 billion people. Let nature take back over even though it probably fucking wouldn't because we've fucked it up so bad with climate change I don't think things would go back to normal. I want to burn my house down, get rid of my parents, burn down my city and get rid of everyone here, burn down the entire fucking world.

I’ve been leaving town a lot to visit my family, so we can’t facetime like we usually do for hours everyday. These calls are mainly what would keep us so close, and now we can’t call. We’ve been getting in a lot of petty fights, and I had a breakdown because of one of them, and I see her getting closer with another one of our friends. I don’t think she completely doesn’t like me anymore, but it just feels like our friendship is getting a lot weaker and I don’t really know what to do. Advice anyone?",02Aug2020,1

It's become very clear through years of treatment that there's nothing anyone can do about my mental illnesses. I'm doomed to feel this way for life or 6 years of intense treatment would've done something.



It's all turned into just anger. I can't handle it. I've been isolating so I don't snap at people, I've been short and rude when I do have to talk to people, I've not been eating, I've been drinking a lot, and just going into rages sometimes like tonight where I just scream, throw things, hit things and all around act like the piece of shit I am.

I want relationships that treat me like the trash I am! I try to seek out red flags but I just can’t find any. Wtf. 

Why can’t they leave the good people alone and take advantage of lesser humans like me. I should be a prime target, I’m small, weak, quiet, low self esteem. What am I doing wrong? Yes I’m aware that I’m warped but I usually hide it",02Aug2020,1

I also dated someone and I found out I was his rebound, which really hurt cause I caught deep feelings for this guy. He’s back with the ex he was with before me, and probably thought of her the whole time with me. I want to be in a happy relationship and it’s not fair he gets that when he hurt me so badly with both his words and actions, and never let me speak my side of the story when I always apologized and listened to his pain. 

 I also feel like I don’t really have real friends to lean on and this pandemic isn’t making it easier to meet people.

37,"Hi, first I just want to say that English is my second language so I apologize for any mistakes, I'm also writing this on mobile so I'm sorry for the format and this is a pretty long story but I will cut out details that don't matter so much. 
So I think I'm being followed/stalked, but if it is the case than this guy is sloppy and that's why I wanted your opinions/advice as I can be a little paranoid from time to time and I don't want to be dramatic if nothing is going on..
Let me give you a little background, I work at a women's clothing store in a mall and I take public transport. There's this bus I catch let's say the #3, it's a straight line from one side of town all the way to a neighbouring town, so I have to take a transfer from home to the #3 for work and vice versa. I first remember seeing this guy about 2 months ago when the malls in my area reopened, and now I feel like I see him everywhere. The first weird thing that happened was a couple weeks ago when I got on the #3 at the end of my shift. The bus was completely empty except for this guy which sat all the way in the back. I listen to music on the bus so I didn't notice right away but when I got up to my stop to wait for another bus he had moved seats and was right behind me, weird but whatever. He then got on the second bus with me and got off at the same stop, I started stressing a bit so I called my roommate (21M, also takes public transport) to ask him if he would meet me and we could walk back to our appartement together. The guy started walking the same way I did but kind of far back and when my friend showed up I looked back but he was gone.
After that I again started seeing him at my workplace, at another mall in town, at the grocery store, etc. But I do have to say it's a small town so it's not that uncommon to see the same people often. But today was just so weird I have to share.. there's this shop in a mall I like but it's in a different town. Like I said the #3 will take you there but it's the last stop. I got in and I spot the guy somewhere in the back so I sit at front and he gets down at the last stop with me and a couple other people. Now I just had one thing to buy so I took a 45 minutes ride for a 5 minutes errand and I would take the bus back all the way to the end of the ride so another 45 mins to catch my transfer. But when I got out he was waiting for the #3 again, he'd just got off with me and I didn't see him get in the mall. He was in line to get in but I guess he saw me and looked back at me, stepped out of the line, and waited to get in behind me. When I got in I was going to at a certain spot but the sit was wet (like and actual puddle) so I sat at the seat in front of that one. But he still sat behind me! I even heard him say ""why is this wet"" so he definitely noticed.But anyway at some point I got lost in my thoughts and then I noticed his hand/phone? right next to my face and I jumped a little bit and he jerked his hand back to his seat. He then went all the way to the last stop where I got off for my transfer. He left the bus first but he looked back and maintained eye contact with me for an uncomfortable amount of time (a good 10 seconds) and went back to wait for the #3.. 
I just don't see how I could be misinterpreting something this is all just so weird..  and I really don't know if he was trying to get a picture of me but we need to wear masks anyways and this was a pretty crowded bus so not a place I'd think someone would do that.. Anyway sorry again that this was so long but I would really appreciate your thoughts on this.",02Aug2020,1

After breaking up with him, I refused to remove that boundary and go any farther sexually because I was scared. In a separate case, I was also sexually assaulted and nearly raped.

41,"i know this is long but please read because i really really need some moral support. or you might find my life story funny because how life finds a way to keep kicking me when i'm down over and over and over again. this is my life story up until today

i was born into a family with a dad who is not at all a father figure. i had to witness him hit my mom, punch things throw chairs at my mom, scream everyday, get drunk, cheat on my mom, say to my face that he thinks i will never even make it through high school and that he ''doesn't give a shit about me''. divorce was constantly debated but they never did because my mom was a stay at home mom of 5 kids. my mom has had ocd tendencies since before i was born. she gave that to me. it is so much worse for me then when she dealt with it.

then my sister is threatening to kill herself, punching holes in the wall, and eventually just gave up on all of us and left to live with her boyfriends family and never came back. i was really close with her. i

then i start getting bullied at my school. my mom took me out of that school and my mom takes me out of that school and i was in and out of schools for 3 years. because of this i had no friends and ended up a year behind in school which i still am.

then at the age of 12 my mental health crashes. everything was too much. so much pressure from school, so much conflict in my house. i had no friends. i had no safe environment. i fall into a bad depression. my ocd was out of control i was spending hours a day checking that the stove was off and the door was locked because i was convinced that if they weren't that it would kill my family. i was having panic attacks. i started anorexic behaviors and some days i would eat nothing at all, only drink 1 cup of coffee. i started cutting myself. i started having bad suicidal thought. i started considering killing myself, daily.

after years of suffering in silence with these issues i finally told my mom that i needed help. she brought me to a therapist. it took many months for me to get any sort of recovery. she diagnosed me with severe ocd and generalized anxiety disorder. i start taking meds. even though my mom acted like i would be a drug addict for it. after a long time the meds and therapy start working a bit and i start to have some good days

just as things start to show any progress my uncle dies. it sends me right back to where i was before

after some more time i start to get the slightest bit better but my mom decides i had had enough treatment and now i was cured. she stopped taking me to therapy when i still very much needed it. i never even got to say goodbye

then i meet this nice boy who was my first friend. we start talking and after a while he asks me to be his girlfriend. i said yes and thought to myself ''yes now things will finally get better''. he texts me only a week after asking me to be his gf that has has changed his mind and no longer wants to be with me...wow it only took a week

then my family decides they want to go on an alaskan cruise. i am forced to go with them. i was 14 at this point. i met another guy on the boat who was 18. we spend a lot of time together on the trip and we start talking more and more... and he starts touching me more and more. hugs lead to kisses on the check which leads to mouth kisses which leads to french kisses. he took my first kiss and didn't even ask my permission. but i let it happen because i was young and hurting and so so desperate for male love because i don't have any in my life. i didn't want anything sexual. i just wanted a hug and for someone to say ''i love you'' and ''it's going to be ok'' to say the things my dad never said to me. i thought that him touching me was just a sign that he loved me. it got so far that he was slapping and grabbing my butt whenever someone looked away and at the last few days of the trip he was literally humping me in a private part of the ship. i hated it and would just stare at the ceiling uncomfortable and scared and waiting for it to be over. but i still let it happen because he told me he was going to marry me and he would say ''i love you'' after he was done. after the trip we kept in touch for probably 5 months . during that time in the begging he would say how much he loved me and that he was gonna marry me. then he starts asking for nudes over and over even when i say no. then he starts sending me unwanted dick pics. that was the first time i ever saw male anatomy. then he starts saying that since he send nudes to me that i need to send them back.. so i did. i sent him pictures of my 14 year old body. i sent him my own child porn. and he couldn't get enough of it. eventually he gets bored and after he had screenshotted everything i sent him me reveals to me that he had a girlfriend the whole time.

this did horrible things to my already shattered mental state.

then my mom gets pregnant and i get excited for once and start planning baby names and preparing to be the best sister i can be for them because i don't have a good relationship with my older sisters. then my mom has a miscarriage and the baby dies

then i get back together with the first guy who broke up with me after 1 week. we've been together even since the miscarriage and i'm 90% sure he just wants my body too because he constantly pressures me for nudes and asks me to suck his dick and gets offended when i don't swallow it. but i stay because he's the only friend i have. he doesn't treat me the best sometimes but he's all that i have

then my mom gets pregnant again. i don't get my hopes up though because of what happened last time

then i start to branch out and try to make new friends. i end up knowing 2 more people that i planned to get to know better

then a freaking PANDEMIC shows up. but because of the timing with my moms pregnancy i haven't been able to see my boyfriend or a single person i know in half a YEAR. ever friendship i was working towards has not forgotten about me. i'm not even allowed to step outside for fresh air because of my moms ocd and she thinks it will kill me. i can count on one hand the amount of times i've been outside in the past 6 months. i am so so isolated. and as the cherry on top of everything i have to give my guinea pigs away because i am to depressed to care for them. i have started to cut again. i have started to have anxiety attacks again.

46,"I’m 23, and I graduated with a degree in journalism but I have heaps of debt because I went to an out of state school for undergrad by taking out so many loans. I feel so stupid about it now but I can’t change the past so I’m just trying to move forward but I don’t know how. 

I did lots of writing for digital publications in college, and recently interned at a PR firm, but that ended 3 months ago, and while I’ve had interviews I still haven’t gotten a job. I have 0 interest in journalism and didn’t like PR all that much either, which I switched into because I thought I would like it better. Now I’m interested in pursuing digital marketing but I don’t know where to start. I interviewed for a digital marketing job and while they considered me a “strong candidate” who made it through 3 rounds of interviews I still wasn’t good enough to get the job.

As far as other skills go, all I do in my free time is try to write my books, edit fan videos from shows I liked growing up using Final Cut Pro, and photoshop images of my sims game that I like to play. None of these I can show to actual jobs because I’m sure they wouldn’t care about stuff like that. I have enough skills to know how to use those programs but I’ve never done anything professionally with them that I can share. 

Also my book has a lot of views on the website wattpad which is kind of embarrassing to share with potential jobs. Like I managed to get an audience of over 200K views, but just feel like I have useless talents because no one would take that stuff seriously. 

I need a job that pays well enough to get me out of this debt, and I don’t know how to do that with my current skills and experiences. And to make things worse I’m back home living with my parents and sharing a room with my 13 year old sister. I just wanna get out of here and have a normal life.

56,"I've smoked for about 23 years. I've also vaped but that has always been done alongside smoking, not as a replacement.

About 7 weeks ago I bought a vape (last one I had was maybe 3 years ago) just because I wanted the fun flavours again. I was fully intending on smoking as well.

After having the vape for a day or two I smoked a cigarette in the evening and got a puff or two into it and it tasted gross. I outed it and figured I'd just stick to the vape for now.

Around a week ago I was making myself a fresh bottle of e-liquid and I forgot to add any nicotine. (I can tell from the colour but didn't click at first) I went the whole day before I noticed, and then also realised that the lack of nicotine wasn't making a difference and vaping the e-liquid was satisfying my urge anyway for whatever reason, so I figured I may as well finish that bottle before making a new batch with nicotine in it, and maybe I'd reduce the amount of nicotine I normally have in it.

Thursday morning I woke up, grabbed my vape, and headed downstairs. As I got to the bottom of the stairs I dropped the vape and smashed the tank, rendering it useless. I guess I could have gotten a few puffs out of the already wet wick, but I didn't bother. I just figured I'd go to work without it, put up with not having it, and then order a replacement tank when I got home...but I was surprised by how I didn't really miss it during the day, so I figured I wouldn't bother ordering a replacement just yet and see what happens. It's now Sunday and I haven't had a cigarette or vaped at all...and it hasn't bothered me.

A similar thing happened with weed just over 3 years ago. I had tried to quit smoking it a few times (I'd smoked weed for just as long as cigarettes) and it had always been too hard, but one day I just woke up and didn't have one. I hadn't intended on trying to stop at that time, it just happened and seemed really easy.

So maybe I'm a non-smoker now, or maybe I'll be injecting nicotine by the end of the week. Who knows?",02Aug2020,1

I just enjoyed the chaos and when I moved to another high school it just wasn't the same, everyone was far too normal and sane.

I’m just not sure if I’m non-binary, because I’ve never really felt any strong amounts of dysphoria, I’m just very neutral when it comes to my own gender. I guess what I’m asking is if there’s any non-binary people who have felt the same way, or if they could give any advice to help figure out what’s going on.

So Serena, my now ex best friend, and I have been friends since freshman year of high school; we started talking during our first period, which was gym class. We both bonded over our mutual love of video games and not wanting to interact with many of the other kids, and we both quickly became good acquaintances. For about all of freshmen year we would talk every now and then; I would ask Serena for homework answers and she’d gladly give them and if she asked me I would do the same, but other than that we rarely talked. There was one day however where Serena caught me feeling really sad and she gave me a paper I had given her a long time ago that said “I hope you have a nice day today” or something along those lines. It was very sweet. 

Skip to sophomore year and Serena and I become a lot closer. We bonded over a lot more things and even gave each other our discord tags; we could talk about anything and everything. We may not have had the same opinion about everything, but we still just enjoyed being in each other’s presence. I found out a lot of personal things about Serena in that time: I found out that she wanted to transition from a boy to a girl and I also understood that her family life was not the greatest at all. Her father and mother were extremely neglectful and unreliable and Serena didn’t enjoy her two siblings. On top of this, they barely had food in the house most of the time and slept with bugs. In reality, I was the only real person who paid any attention to Serena; every other one of her friends were online. 
 
Eventually, this friendship began to blossom further. I remember one instance I was talking to Serena and I talked about the joy of listening to music under the stars, but because she didn’t have a phone or an MP3 player she couldn't experience that. So one Christmas, I gave her a portable radio with a cd of some songs I liked, and have it to her so she could have that experience. She’s a music geek, so I knew she would at least appreciate it. We would walk to class together, give each other gifts, many of which were handmade, and talk all night on the phone. 

Valentine’s Day came along and Serena treated me to a piano piece of one of the songs on the cd. It was one of the sweetest gestures anybody had ever given me before. My friends at lunch that day kept asking if I was going to go out with Serena, and honestly I wasn’t completely opposed to the idea, but I definitely wasn’t sure about it either. That same day Serena showed up at my house with two stuffed animals and my favorite colored roses, and from them on we spent the rest of the day together. Slightly by all of the gifts I was receiving from Serena, but mostly in the heat of lovesickness, I kissed her and we became a couple. We didn’t do anything other than kiss occasionally or hold hands in the hallway. 

This is when the trouble began to emerge. 

I had an art competition coming up and I was extremely nervous about it, being a insecure fifteen year old and all. Of course, I brought Serena along to support me. I went through the competition and the piece that I didn’t want to go through to the rest of the competition went through, while the piece I put all of my blood, sweat and tears into was cast to the side. I was extremely upset about it and even cried, and not once did Serena support me. She just sat there, staring at me while I cried. No hugs, no “I’m sorry’s”, nothing. When we went out to eat while waiting for the results of the price that did go through, still nothing. Up to this point I had been seriously considering the relationship and I discovered that I couldn’t emotionally handle being with somebody who was in the transition phase of, well transitioning. I fell in love with Serena for who they were as a boy; I didn’t know what they were like as a girl yet because they simply weren’t a girl. I didn’t want to fall in love with the guy version of Serena when the girl version could be completely different than the one I fell for. This instance of no support was just the tipping point for me to tell her. 

I pulled Serena aside and told her I was going to break up with her, but that we could still be friends if she wanted. She was obviously distraught as I was her first real girlfriend and I explained the situation, and she told me, if it meant we could be together, she would give up transitioning. Obviously I saw through this and told Serena I couldn’t let her do that because she wanted to be a girl, and giving that up to be with me wasn’t right. She still tried to convince me, but I refused. I made it clear that this was no fault of her own and I also made it clear that I wasn’t breaking up with her because she wanted to be transgender. I was totally up for the idea of trying again when she was at a stage where she could really love herself for her. I just couldn't do that then because of how much she hated herself. I wanted to love the her that she loved. 

Things were tense for a couple of days but then we went back to being friends again, arguably our bond stronger than ever. But unfortunately, things began to spiral again. 
Serena has a tendency of getting lost in her own mind; when one horrific, untrue thought would pop up into her head she would cling onto it and assume that was the case. She admitted late one night that she felt like the only reason she was my friend was because she still loved me. Being a sensitive girl with massive trust issues from previous relationships, this didn’t go well with me and I took it as she was lying to me. At the time, I wasn’t aware that this was just a doubt of hers and took it as fact, which was poor communication on both of our parts. However, she did repeat the same actions later on in many other scenarios. I considered this falling out strike one of our relationship.

Skip to junior year and I was in an accelerated learning program, going on with my life and doing everything I could to get out of school ASAP. Serena however was still in normal school, doing her thing. At this point I had a habit of showing Serena my art and she would compliment it and support me, but one day I asked her if she “really liked it or if she was just telling me that”. It was originally supposed to be a joke because of course she likes my art, why would she compliment it otherwise? But then she admitted to me that she actually hated my art compared to many other artists and was just too scared to tell me because I was sensitive. This was strike two.

 I explained to her that lying to me about my art was way worse than just telling me outright that this art style “just wasn’t her thing” I would’ve left her alone, but she led me on that my art was so good and gave me so much confidence, only to tear it all down by admitting this. Serena apologized extensively for her actions, but the damage was done. I tried for six months to forgive and forget, but along with many other instances like this where the same mistakes on her end seemed to be repeated, which was lying to me in order to save me the heartache, I just couldn’t handle it. 

I began to see more troubling things about Serena’s personality; I realized that she doesn’t really try at anything she does and expects everything wrong in her life to be fixed by one little thing, whether that be with a job or inspiration or whatever it is. Whenever I tried to confront Serena about sticking to a schedule or actually trying something, she would dismiss me either by ignoring me or claiming she was too stressed to talk, which was fine the first couple of times, but when that happens every single time I try to talk to you about your future it doesn’t look good on you.

 I also realized that despite being the closest to Serena and giving her the most attention, she yells at me a lot more compared to her other friends, which I’ve tried befriending before only to find out that they were not the nicest bunch of people. When I confronted Serena about this she said she didn’t care enough to yell at them and that I should feel honored that she even has the courage to yell at me. That didn’t sit right with me. I wanted to be treated the same way that Serena treated all of her other friends, where she didn’t yell at them or raise a hand to them. Despite asking her to do this for me, this never happened. 

Skip to now: COVID-19 starts and I’m now I’m left in a situation where I’m stuck in the house with my alcoholic/smoker mother who is extremely manipulative and abusive, along with my stepfather who is submissive to her and only raises his voice to me when I’m out of line. I’ve been in quarantine since the coronavirus started (even earlier honestly) because my mom is extremely paranoid. I haven’t seen any of my friends or gone into a store for six months. I was extremely stressed with my parents around 24/7, to the point that I almost committed suicide. When talking to my mother about the fact that she made me want to die, she was completely dismissive of my feelings. To her I was either a “manipulative teenager who used suicide to threaten her” or a “lunatic who needed to be sent away to a hospital”. Both of those labels completely dehumanized me. 

At this point I needed Serena really badly. She was the only friend I still talked to. I always stuck around her whenever she felt suicidal or depressed and I never left her side when she needed me the most. Serena never truly listening to my problems, either leaving when things got too stressful for her (this was almost every single time I brought up my problems. If it wasn’t that it was this next thing) or overshadowing my problems with hers. I would say “I feel sad” and she would say “well I feel like a failure because I can’t make you happy”. Again, this is fine a couple of times, but every time made it ridiculous. 

The day after my attempted suicide I told Serena what had happened, and she was shocked. She didn’t react really, all she could say was that she was sorry. I wanted her to show some sort of emotion towards the situation or at least tell me how she was feeling, but she couldn’t do that. I began to vent to her about how I wanted her to at least show some sign of emotional vulnerability, to show me that she cared about me, and this is when Serena broke the news to me that she didn’t want to be my friend anymore because of my anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies. She made me feel like my feelings were completely invalid. I felt utterly betrayed, as I had poured in my heart and soul to help and care for Serena and she couldn’t even be with me now in my time of need. In her fit of panic she told me to stop telling her things about my depression and told me if I was feeling suicidal to just not tell her and basically just to leave her alone. That was strike three. 

We separated for about a week or so at a time, coming back together every now and then to talk about some things, but it didn’t feel the same. Serena told me she was trying desperately to change herself to become more socially competent, as again, I was the first real friend that she had other than the ones she had that she exclusively played video games with, but at the point I couldn’t do it anymore. She was clearly moving on however; we didn’t like the same games anymore and she had new friends who she spent all of her time with. I cut off the relationship and blocked her, still remaining civil, but sometimes I wish I hadn’t been. Sometimes I wish I could’ve vented all of my feelings, but I know deep down that probably would’ve made me feel worse or she wouldn’t have really listened to me. 

I will admit I wasn’t a saint in this relationship and I wish somebody could just tell me what I did wrong to deserve this kind of treatment, after I felt like I had been really nice to Serena. This is the third major  relationship that has fallen apart for me, the previous two being my first girlfriend who  mo**sted me and gaslighted me, and my first serious boyfriend who was emotionally absent during our entire relationship, and then TRIED to r*pe me as my friend prom date (we were broken up at the time) by taking me to the after party against my will. As revenge I threw stuffed animals on his lawn that have gave me, to which he proceeded to call me a slut over text on my sixteenth birthday, even though I was a virgin. 

Honestly, I’m just tired of being treated so horribly I feel so pompous for even saying that, I feel like it’s a sin to want to be treated right. I really do wonder if the root problem lies with me and if it is, I want somebody to tell me. I wonder if I’m being too sensitive about this. Am I the horrible person? I hope not, I try so hard not to be horrible because of how wrong my past relationships have gone and because of the things I’ve experienced. 

Anyhow, if you made it this far, thanks for listening. Sorry about grammar mistakes and all, I didn’t really proofread this. I’m also sorry for this being extremely long. I’m also also sorry if my thoughts seemed unorganized. If anything else, this really helps me get this all off of my chest. So again, thank you for taking the time to read my post.

68,"I realised that my friend is the protagonist. He’s kind of dumb and oblivious, but in that particular friend group, everyone wants to be in his team, talk to him, just be involved with him. He does a lot of cool stuff and his good at most things I wanna be good at. And I’m jealous of him. But then I realised, if he’s the protagonist, then I’m definitely the deep, complex, badass side character who is somewhat prominent. I either start as the villain and turn good, or vice versa. I’m the Kylo Ren. I’m the Winter Soldier. I’m the Azula. (I think that’s Azula idk haven’t watched the whole show yet). So if you ever realise that someone you know is the protagonist, think about what you are in the story. And if you turn out to be the comedic relief (that’s you if you’re reading this Henry), then that sucks, because you could be so much more if the writers put effort into it.

74,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be very nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go at  the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/really moody/mad about it so idk what to as then it was probably annoying too. One point I nodded in agreement at something she said in a moody way and she said ‘could look more enthusiastic about it like’ in an annoyed way. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. 

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst she was facing on the computer in front of her and she laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley/giggly way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and every single time  in person so she was probably surprised I did something because she assumes I’m thick and useless   :/ like when I finished the appointment and as I walked away after saying bye she went ‘awwwww ok......and well done’ as I was walking away. I felt talked to like a 5 year old. Also she said ‘let me know if you need any travel expenses/new job support etc’ often on email replies when I told her I got a job.

It came up in conversation randomly this afternoon for the first time in 1.5 years and I asked him how long he kept this creepy pic for, assuming that he must've deleted it within a few days/weeks out of guilt. He said he probably had it for a year or so and had simply forgotten about it after a while, hence it was there for a year.

91,"I use to be in the military from 2003-2014.  I didn’t get out by choice.  I was forced out due to the Great Force Redux in 2014. The entire time I was in, I was thinking I was going to make it to 20 years and retire.  When I was forced out, I held onto to a lot of resentment for a very long time!  Imagine being forced out of the only career and lifestyle you knew.  It was fucking devastating!  

I’ll admit, the first few years out of the military were a huge struggle.  In fact, my wife (previously a stay home mom) was forced to work in order for us to make ends meet.  And while I still had that resentment, I kept my composure and imagined myself moving up in the world.

I started off working at a bank call center making $14/hr.  Gradually though, I slowly improved myself and switched jobs to a finance retirement center making $20/hr then $21/hr a year later.

Eventually, I found my current gov’t position where I not only do I make more than $40/hr, but I have more personal freedom than ever before!  Something I didn’t have much in the two private sector positions and I really didn’t have in the military.  

Looking back and comparing to the military, its not just the pay that makes my current career awesome (although admittedly the pay is pretty sweet), but its a ton of things!  A few that I will list here: I have more time off (I work 8 days on and 6 days off), I have more freedom to go anywhere during my time off, and freedom to choose whether to work OT or not (99% of the time I do).  Not to mention a sweet pension and health care benefits for life when I do decide to retire (and not forced out at 20 years or so like the military).  I say decide when to retire because I’ve worked with guys who have been with this agency for 30-40+ years!  And one of the reasons they don’t retire is because they love what they do!  

I didn’t experience any of this in the military.  The pay was okay at the time, but it was just enough to get by.  I couldn’t afford a new car or buy a new house with a pool (even with the housing allowance that was given).  To make the equivalent of what I make now in the military, I would have to be either an E9 or an O2E (if I stayed in, I would have had 17 years of service to date).  Those ranks just didn’t seem reachable.

The work schedule was dead set in stone. In fact, one supervisor mention to changing our work schedule to from 5 days on 2 days off to 4 days on 3 days off to the higher ups, he received so much push back and grief about it that he was pretty much guilt tripped to apologize for even mentioning it.  And during our time off, we were limited as to where we could go and what we could do.  Sometimes, because the fault of one person, we weren’t allowed to drink on the weekends. And lets not even mention how many times I pulled 12-18 hour days only to get a “good work” compliment (if even that much).  I might have gotten a “comp day” that I could take later on or  maybe allowed to “sleep in” the next day and report to work later on in the day if I was lucky.

My list goes on and on, but these are the important things I’d figure I’d list.  So little by little I’ve come to realize that the military, even with some of its benefits...just wasn’t fit for me.  And slowly, my resentment of being kicked out is leaving me and now I’m coming to terms with myself and being at peace with it.",02Aug2020,1

97,"Yesterday I got high and began a really weird trip in which I was aware and conscious about everything for 2 long hours, but in the meantime my body moved by itself (e.g. wiggling my butt, mimic a gun, the movement of a bike) so I had to lie down in bed and I also made some weird noises with my mouth during that time.

98,"I’m just going to put everything out there and maybe someone will care enough to read all of it and help me.

I’m 18 years old and graduated high school yesterday and even at my graduation I wasn’t really happy. I work at a retail store and I hate every single time I have to go there. When I’m there I spend most my time inside of my head just thinking of these very intense sad thoughts, I’ve literally went to the the bathroom while working just to cry. It’s not even a hard job and the people aren’t even bad but I just can’t help but feel so useless like i’m just a machine wasting my life. I understand I have to work to survive but i hate it so bad. The most oddest thing about it is that when I didn’t have a job I felt so bored and empty and could spend days just laying outside on my porch doing nothing but thinking of sad thoughts. That’s why I got a job because I thought it would make me feel like I’m contributing to society and make me feel like I actually have a purpose but instead it just took my boredom at home and transferred the sad thoughts to when I’m at work. I pay for happiness with hours of unhappiness. Work just makes me feel more sad because I’m around people all day with my head down and look like tears are about to roll out of my eyes but  it seems like not a single person around me cares which I’m return makes me feel even more useless. I don’t want to go to college because I hate school and have no desire to be anything college careers offer. I don’t want to be a doctor, mechanic or a police officer. I thought I had it figured it and wanted to be a you-tuber because most of my time is spent playing video games and I did good I got all the way up to 349 subscribers, but there are days when I don’t feel like making a video and watching it rank worse than the other videos I made. Some days I feel like video games are useless so how could I ever be a gaming youtuber with thoughts like that. I’m a very weird human and I didn’t ask to be this way, it sucks and I wish I was just a normal kid with a girlfriend who enjoyed his job but I’m not that. Sometimes when I get really sad I will go running because I hate running and I try to make self better and it helps but it doesn’t get rid of the sadness permanently. I don’t know what will happen to a person like me in this world because I have no desires yet I’m sad and always desiring someone I don’t even want.

99,"So I have a 12 year old brother who recently got Minecraft and in the beginning he would be on it day and night and my parents paid no heed thinking he will soon get tired of it but it only got worse, since my parents are busy with work and other things I've been given the duty to monitor him during online classes so that he's not playing during class and i have partial control over when he gets to play Minecraft. So today he was instructed to not play but then he insisted that he would play only for a while so i told him 30mins ( i did plan on giving him an 30mins) so i just put in a friendly reminder to him saying that he has only 15mins to play and he proceed to say "" i don't care about what you say i'm calling dad."" After the phone call to my dad he comes back to the room and shuts down the pc and i ask him why he did that and he said that dad said ""shut down the pc and do anything apart from playing Minecraft.""

Now this put my brother in a really sour mood but put me in a good mood simply because even when i was being nice he decide he wanted to be rude and greedy (he planned on asking my dad for more time) .

So if any younger siblings are reading this, always be nice to your older siblings because honestly you have no idea what they can have in store for you it could be good or natural karma like in the case above.

100,"Whenever I hear someone who calls themselves feminist talk there is a real feeling that they hate men or something. Maybe this isn't every feminst, I don't know. Feminist talk about sexism and male dominance etc. Here are my thoughts on this.

The real cause of these things is power. It causes people to act diffently. It is only that historically and currently men have been in positions of power but that doesn't mean that they act this way because they are men. Of course you may wan't to change that, these's nothing wrong with that, but  This irrational hate on men is wrong and has to stop. Y

You may also argue ""Then placing a bunch of women into positions of power will solve everyhting, right? Right a historical wrong?"". I don't think so.  I am against radical change, dadical change only brings trouble and uncertainty I think that's the last thing anybody would want now or in a post-covid world. Change can happen but it should be incemental, and it should happen at a sort of grassroot level. It can be hard to chage an adult but a child can be educated.

102,"1. She wasn’t the closest friend to me neither was I to her. Our friendship started after I first saw her at an exhibition from uni juniors, I couldn’t look at her at first as I never came see her in the classes, after more than a year. She sent me messages on FB and we’d chat.
It dramatically improved after I got a crush on someone else and I would ask relationship advices from her. Share every single stories by text or call about how it was going on with my crush.
2. And sometimes we’d actually talk, have fun jerk around. Although even till now I couldn’t look into her eyes, she was a sister to me, and she was too beautiful; I am not super shy around girls, but there I was.
3. But she was super conservative and had my image in her mind as a religious guy.
4. Sometimes I’d call her sis, she would then reply I never was a sis to you, u are only some guy to me.
She had breakup one year before we got to know each other, and she was still upset, not depressed, but she was obsessive about how people change, break promises and like those stuff. Her BF was her classmate and they’ve known each other for a year to announce that they were best friend. But she was in a relationship just months after; as she told me.
5. The crack in our friendship was caused by me telling I am smoking hash with a childhood friend of mine and that he was my best friend, I kept this smoking thing away from her, since we knew each other. Now she got the wrong impression of me and stopped talking to me.
It was January, 2020.
6. Till now I used to share with her almost any convo related to my crush, sometimes I’d treat her because her advices actually worked. But after she stopped talking I became super sad, I can even call it a depression, as this never happened to me before, I never lost a friend before. I even lost any interest in my crush as well. It felt like my whole world was perishing, and I felt like trapped inside a blackhole, unbearable loneliness.
7. It’s been around 7/8 months. Every night I keep thinking about her. 
She only talked to me twice during this period, decent and caring as before. She expressed her empathy, said she was depressed the time she stopped talking and she couldn’t felt this would affect me like that. And in a clear voice she said she wouldn’t say sorry for all these.
8. She never called me back, neither did I. I still miss her everyday and lost faith in friendship.",02Aug2020,1

One by one, their toes and and fingers blackened, one child’s finger would break off and then the others would snap their own off to see what it was like. School was full of people who were perfectly warm, and others who were also missing digits, hidden under their sleeves. Grandparents house was warm, too warm for the freshly cold-burned, but it was welcomed anyway. Although, you could never quite acclimate, you could never understand how things could be so warm, how you suddenly felt so much when all you felt was numb. Slowly time passed and more limbs had succumbed to the weather. Eventually one of them would be frozen entirely, and a quick tap was all it took to shatter the boy. There could never be warm again, couldn’t stand it, and I’d never let the cold catch me long enough to do what it does best. So here I isolate in the barren medium, not too cold, but never warm.

* I went back to the same college instead of moving onto university, so did he.

117,"I work as a Software engineer in a  mid-sized startup. It's a good company, but they suffer from a terrible circle-jerking problem. It seemed benign at first, but after being with them for close to a year it's insufferable.

The problem is, that anything good that happens there, It is because of the upper-management and leadership skills of our so-called-leaders. This logic has become ingrained. Earlier it used to be subtle, but the pandemic erased all the subtleties. We fucking worked nearly double time, during the pandemic. Everyone knew what was at stake. The free-market kills you if you don't immediately innovate in a  catastrophe. And we didn't want that fate for us. And then after a few months when things relatively calmed down, we received a mail from the  CEO of how grateful he is for the leaders of the company that helped them navigate through the crisis.

# What motherfucking bitch nugget!

We burned ourselves out to ride the wave. And you thankless asshole didn't even remember to mention the people who put in the effort. Thanking only the people who manage people who manage people who manage people.  Not even a note of thanks to the employees who handled the implementation. **We could've said no.** **We could've just worked our normal times. It would have led to bad performance reviews, but you still couldn't fire us because you need us**.  But we understood what this crisis meant, not just for one individual,  but everyone around us. So we cooperated. Not in greed, but in solidarity.

Some might believe that I am nitpicking. But I think that the workers should AT LEAST be thanked in equal to the leaders, if not more. Heck When I see myself from a leadership lens, it's courtesy to start with people who do the groundwork, and building up to something like "" **Last but not the least, I thank thy leaders**  "" or some shit. Then it's somewhat fair. Otherwise, it comes as nothing short of a gut punch and makes spending another day there unbearable.

122,"How many people here actually give YouTube's suggestions page feedback about the videos the algorithm suggests? I do, and frankly, m experience in doing so has made me not trust Google as a competent organization.  

Take, for instance, a hypothetical video called ""ChrisLStreams posts on Reddit"". I watched the video, I enjoyed the video, but I don't want to see the video again because I've already watched it. So when YouTube recommends the video to me again, I tell YouTUbe I'm not interested because I've already watched the video.  

I then refresh the page, and what video is at the top of my suggestions? The very same video that I just said I'm not interested in, plus five other videos that I've already watched.  

What is the fucking point in accepting human feedback in a systematic manner if the fucking algorithm is just gonna ignore the feedback?  

If I take ten videos off my recommendations because I've already watched them, and YouTube responds by putting seven different videos I've already watched and three of the ones I just told the algorithm I don't want to see again, how the fuck am I supposed to trust this company with any of my user data?    

One trillion dollars. That's how much this company is worth. This company is worth more than the federal budget of **all but six nations**, and it can't even fucking listen when I tell it to quit showing me videos that the algorithm already knows it has shown me.  

I will literally watch a video in entirety, click back to the home page, and that very same video is first in my recommendations. It doesn't matter if I tell it I'm not interested and why, because as soon as I watch one more video, that first video is back in my suggestions again.  

It's getting to a point where I'm strongly considering deleting my YouTube account, permanently logging out of Gmail, and setting up a web blocker which will automatically ban all Google services from being accessed by my computer.

So my friend had us round to his house last night for some drinks. I can’t really remember the details surrounding what happened cause I was pretty wasted, but I’m pretty sure I have like a hazy memory of jokingly slapping one of my girl friends on the ass, and it’s maybe not even a big deal but I feel really bad about it. I’m not the kind of guy who does that kind of shit and puts his hands on a girl without her consent, I honestly don’t know where that came from. I’m pretty sure she bent over to get something and I just done it thinking it was funny, and it’s not like a big deal was made out of it or anything; I can’t remember how she reacted but it hasn’t been mentioned since and we were completely cool with each other after it. I’ve had some of my female friends slap my ass when we’re dancing or something for a joke too so it’s not like there’s zero precedent for it, but I’d hate to think she was actually uncomfortable with it and just laughed it off in the moment cause she was scared to mention it. I know firsthand the kind of shit they have to put up with from creepy dudes and I never want to be the source of that.

Like I’ve known her for years so it’s not like I done it to some random girl like a complete creep, but I still feel like that kind of shit’s just not okay. If we were out together and she told me some dude had done that to her I’d be really angry about it. She was pretty drunk too so she might not even remember it, hell I’m not 100% sure it happened that way or if I’m getting the details or context mixed up or something, but if that is what happened I feel really bad about it. It’s not who I am, it’s not how I ever want to act around women, and even though I know I thought it was a joke at the time the fact women have to accept that kind of shit ‘as a joke’ in the first place is the whole fucking problem. I know better than to act like that and still done it anyway, my friends all see me as this really innocent and harmless dude so she probably thought nothing of it, but I’m really disappointed in myself for acting like that man, and I just feel like a complete asshole for thinking that was okay.",02Aug2020,1

130,"Some backstory: I’m 16M very shy living in COViD America and for some reason my mom decided we should take a week long vacation eight hours away at a rented beach house with her friend and her family and now I think I’m in love??

Her friend is also bringing her husband and two daughters (15) (18) (I’ll call them F1 and F2) I’ve known them since I was little and I would basically call them my sisters at this point because we known each other our whole lives. 

Anyways they unexpectedly announce that they will each bring a friend ( F3 which is 15 and F4 which is 16) ok, no big deal eight people in a small house for a week we probably already have Coronavirus. We are spending a week with them at this house on the waterfront. 

Since I’m shy and forgot my anxiety medication I don’t talk for like half the week. (This was my first time meeting F3 and F4) All of them are really sweet and great people it’s just that people aren’t my cup of tea. Us teens talked a little on the first day but I go quiet for 2 days and finally I break out on Wed halfway through the trip. We hangout on the beach and in this outdoor hot tub together all trip and talk about life everyone’s pretty calm and relaxed and we all have fun and like one another. 

Now F3 friend is really outgoing and always talking and laughing telling stories etc while F4 is more calm and shy like me (also good looking). 
A couple days go by and I’m starting to really like F4 (as a friend) even though we never talked one on one. Well suddenly it’s Fri the second to last day and by the end of the day I realize something. Do I like F4 or do I like like F4? She is super relatable, sweet, funny, shy, calm, good looking and essentially my dream girl (I would prefer to date a person similar to me). 

I wasn’t sure but what I was sure of was I was still nervous as hell to talk to her after a week. By Sat next morning we leave unexpectedly early without really saying goodbye to them but I did get the courage to ask for everyone’s IG and made a vacation group chat. On the car ride home they dm each other sending photos they took etc but F4 doesn’t chat really and neither do I. 

We go back home and by night time I realize I can’t stop thinking about F4, a feeling I’ve never had before. I’ve had small crushes in school and stuff but F4 is literally keeping me up all night thinking about her. I miss her already. I start to have thoughts about her (nothing sexual, which is weird for 16) like talking hanging out holding hands etc even though we barely talked throughout the trip. I think about her smile and how nice and perfect she was and by then I figure out maybe I love her?. 

I haven’t slept in two days and can’t stop thinking about her and I’ve never felt this way I want to dm her but I’m way too nervous and I’m not even sure what I’m feeling rn. I never felt this way before so I guess I’m in love? What should I do? Ignore the group chat? Message her privately? I really don’t know but I do know that I probably missed my chance since I didn’t realize what I felt till after the trip and my darn anxiety. I probably won’t see her until next vacation (maybe a couple years) she also lives in a different state. Not sure what I’m feeling or what to do about it.

I love watching Netflix stuff both movies and series's, and recently a lot of new seasons and series's have been released that are interesting to me. However I cannot for the life of me begin to watch them, despite me really enjoying the older seasons and/or the trailers. I realise the majority of  people use Netflix as a form of procrastination.  But I procrastinate watching Netflix, by re-watching old videos on YouTube or just re watching Friends. I just cant bring myself to watch new stuff. Does anyone else experience this?",02Aug2020,1

140,"I've been having anxiety about this for the past couple days, and could really use some insight.

So I recently moved to California where I began taking horse riding lessons with an older gentleman. At the end of my first lesson, which happened about two weeks ago, I asked him if we could set up my second appointment. He said he wasn't sure what his schedule was going to look like in the next couple weeks, but that he would get back to me shortly and let me know.

Fast forward to Thursday morning and I still haven't heard shit from him. Growing impatient, I decide to take the initiative and reach out to him. I sent him a text asking if he had a slot open for me next week. He said that he wasn't sure, as he needed to check his schedule first, but that, again, he would get back to me. Several hours pass and still no word. So later that evening, just before his business is set to close, I send him another text. I try to make it as non-naggy, but urgent as possible, hinting that I need to know as soon as possible, since I may not be able to take a lesson next week if I don't get the time off work soon enough. When I wake up Friday morning, there was still no text. I'm seriously pissed at this point, but am still trying to give my instructor the benefit of the doubt, so I send him *another* text asking if my messages are getting through, trying to make it sound like I suspect there might be something wrong with either of our phones. His response this time is prompt, and he basically just says that yes, he's getting my texts, he just hasn't had time to look at the schedule yet.

Well, here we are on Saturday morning, and (surprise, surprise) I still don't have a CLUE what is going on next week. No idea if I need to or even can get time off work so I can go to my second lesson. Look, I understand the guy is busy and has a lot of students, but are you HONESTLY telling me that between Thursday and now he couldn't spare two minutes to look at his damn schedule and tell me whether or not he had time for me next week? I'm being driven absolutely crazy by this, as riding horses has long been a dream of mine, but I'm starting to wonder if this guy even *wants* me as a student.

At this point, I don't know what to do. I have a feeling that if I stop nudging him, I'll *never* get another lesson scheduled. But at the same time, I don't want to come across as naggy and needy. What should I do in this predicament?",02Aug2020,1

142,"I've been watching Sweden closely for a couple months after reading an article written by their chief epidemiologist. They didn't lockdown, they didn't close schools, and they didn't wear masks...

Their confirmed cases and confirmed deaths have absolutely plummeted. They did have a high per capita death rate, but countries with stricter policies didn't necessarily do better.

By all appearances it seems they front-loaded their exposure and achieved herd immunity. They addressed the virus in one wave up front, rather than having segments of their population attempt isolation/shielding only to catch it anyway over a longer period of time.

And it seems to have worked! At the same time, the abundant testing worked well in South Korea. Results vary all over the world, even in America from state to state between places with similar rules.

There is more to discuss about the virus than many want to admit. Most people desire a concrete, black and white worldview. One way of finding this is by ""listening to the experts"". Which is often a good idea! Unfortunately it can lead to so much success that we reinforce the behavior beyond any malleability.

Often times there is no single correct answer to a problem. A scientist can provide you with useful data, models, and predictions about the behavior of phenomena. But they aren't tasked with telling us how society should function. Science isn't in the business of determining our value systems or our tolerance for risk.

Like all of life's big problems this is nuanced, and we should have the discussion with that in mind. It doesn't help that [PR firms](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-world-health-organization-hired-a-top-pr-firm-to-fight-covid-smears-in-the-us?fbclid=IwAR0auOV6c8botuaofza3hSoe-IbjKsr1IsOn1hOYuUKPmeiaRDrdJKKBebQ) are definitely involved in pushing narratives on social media.",02Aug2020,1

144,"To be specific, I was Junior from Veggietales, a Christian children's show with vegetable protagonists which I watched quite a bit at that age. I was with Laura Carrot, we were outside and it was dark--pitch dark. But it was not night. Laura gestured up at the sun directly above us, in whatever way a baby carrot can gesture at all, and said, ""Look, Clash, the sun's gone purple.""

And it had. The sun, hanging large and lifeless, glowed a dim violet, but seemed to cast no light on the neighborhood at all. It was the middle of summer, and it was cold out. Something was very wrong. ""Yeah, we should probably get inside,"" I responded. ""There's a church right across the street. That might be unlocked."" We crossed the empty street, and hopped our vegetable bodies through the ornate double doors.

Warm air blasted from the foyer. The low murmur of grown-up voices filled the room--serious voices. ""Come in,"" someone said. ""Close that door,"" said another. We did. And when the door shut, I was no longer Junior. I was myself, in all my four-limbed glory. And my carrot companion was now Audra, my friend from kindergarten.

I was relieved to see all these people here. They were all talking about what was going on. I knew they'd figure out what to do. Maybe this would all just pass. ""It's just an eclipse,"" I heard a man saying. ""The sun can be purple during an eclipse. It'll pass.""

But if it was to pass, it wasn't happening quickly. And all the grown-ups were talking on and on about astronomical phenomena, leaving Audra and I with nothing to do. So, she and I explored a bit. There wasn't a ton to look at in the foyer or the hallway. All we found were some poorly colored-in pictures hung up on the walls of Noah leading animals to the arc--leading them somewhere safe to hide away before the storm came. I wanted to look out the at the sky again, but we couldn't find a single window.

Then we made our way into the sanctuary. Its atmosphere was drastically different. This place was older than the church surrounding it. It fulfilled the promise of the ornate door we'd entered. A giant cross stood dimly lit behind the pulpit and the rows of yellow wooden pews. It was empty except for two older women drinking coffee near the back. But what caught my eye most were the beautiful stained-glass windows along the walls.

I crept toward one of them, a depiction of Mary holding a baby Jesus. I nearly put my eye to a purple tile, but I realized that wouldn't do, and shifted to a light yellow one. And I was delighted by what I saw. It was bright outside. The sun was yellow, and the sky was blue again. I could see people swimming in a public pool. It was a normal summer day again.

I shouted the news to Audra and the ladies in the back. ""It's good to go outside again!"" I yelled. I was proud of myself for making such an important discovery. The adults had no idea because the foyer had no windows, and they hadn't wanted to open the doors. I ran out of the sanctuary. ""It's good to go outside again! I looked out of the stained glass windows in the sanctuary, and it was bright out, and people are swimming!""

The adults liked the sound of that, and we all raced outside to make the most of the rest of this strange summer day. But it had not been good to go outside again. It was still cold. The sky was still dark. The sun was still purple, and it seemed like it had gotten bigger. There was a strange high-pitched sound in the distance. Someone turned around and grabbed the door. It had been locked behind us. All the adults looked at me. Some of them ran off. Audra did. *That's not possible*, I thought.

I walked to the side of the sanctuary, and saw it. A small CRT television was set up on a schoolroom desk right outside the stained-glass portrait of Mary. It was connected to an orange extension cable that seemed to stretch away into forever. I turned the TV toward me, and I saw a man jumping into a swimming pool on a nice summer's day playing back on a loop. I stepped back in horror. I tripped in doing so, but this was not the result of fear. The ground had begun to shake, and I realized then that the sound in the distance was a medley of screams. It was getting closer.

Most of the adults from the church had already dispersed, running away from wherever they each judged the sound to be coming from. But I held my ground and looked toward it. The ground shook. *Thud. Thud. Thud.* Those were footsteps. And then, from the dark, it emerged. It was a towering, gelatinous purple monster, covered in dark spots. It must have been 100 feet tall. It looked precisely like the Fib from Veggietales, but I knew for certain that it was a different monster.

It was pulling down power lines, smashing cars, stomping houses, and down the road was a crowd of terrified people running toward me. But I couldn't run. I was frozen watching the destruction. Every time it stepped, the street would tremor, and some of the people would fall and be trampled. It was hard to stay on my feet just watching, but I couldn't look away. Then I saw my mother, running, terrified, and I ran all the way home

The house was empty. My whole family must have been out there running from that *thing*. I saw the sun again through the living room window and quickly shut the curtain. I locked the front door. *But what if they come back?* I thought. *What if they come back, and they don't have their keys? What if I lock them out like I did with the people at the church?* I unlocked the door and ran into the basement.

There weren't any windows here. I would just have to wait until someone found me, if that would ever even happen. I sat in the bean-bag chair at the other side of the ping pong table and cried and cried. Then I heard a click. The front door was opening. I wanted to yell, but I didn't hear any voices. All I heard were footsteps--quiet, gentle footsteps. I saw a shadow in the basement stairwell, descending. ""Hello?"" I said in a whisper. There was no answer. Then I saw it.

The monster had descended my stairwell. It was person-sized now, but it was the same monster. It was calm. ""Hi, Junior,"" it said in a friendly voice. I gasped. I shrunk into the beanbag chair. ""Hey, what gives?"" it said. It picked up a ping pong paddle and began to bounce the ball. ""Do you want to play some table tennis?"" it asked.

""No,"" I whispered, drawing my knees to my chest.

""Come on, play ping pong with me."" And though its voice was calm and polite, I knew this was a command. So I rose up, shaking, and grabbed the other paddle.

""I'll serve, it said."" And we played. It knew that I knew what it had done to my family, and I knew that I could never stop playing so long as it wanted me to. First, it wanted to destroy the neighborhood. Now it wanted to play 5 billion consecutive rounds of ping pong against this one kindergartner and nothing in this world could stop it from taking what it wanted. So we played ping pong forever.

Then I woke up, and even now I remember it vividly, like I dreamed it yesterday. Do any of y'all remember any bizarre childhood dreams?",02Aug2020,1

I feel like this is one of the best opportunities to meet the love of your life. This past semester, I became decent friends with this girl in my math class. I find her personality really nice. She is determined, hardworking, ""nerdy"", and seems optimistic a lot of the time. I really enjoyed the time spent with her as she was the one with the cool stories, and we also shared fun times. Often I would be excited in going to my math class because it's the time where I'd get to see her. I genuinely have an interest in her, but she has made it very clear that she doesn't want a relationship right now (she doesn't know I like her. I haven'tmade any moves on her either). I completely understand that respect her decision 100%. But that leaves me asking; what should I do. To wait until she is ready, so I can be more expressive about my feelings towards her. Or to let it be and look for someone else. I have considered both actions, but don't know what it's better. So redditors, what do say about this?

I was never sure that I would achieve anything worthy of greatness in life, and sometimes I wonder what eludes me. Having decided to want to change my life for the better, I took a break from college and quit my multiple jobs. My depression, however, had instead drove me to escape reality by distracting myself from the important things in my life. 

After being in a chaotic household with no sense of personal space for what seemed like an eternity, I had eventually conquered that hill. I used some of my savings to move out. I finally got my own headspace and started my business, deciding that I wanted to be the change I wanted to see in the world. I started posting on Reddit, asking for advice on my website, asking about business and a bunch of other things. Luckily enough, I got into contact with an experienced web developer who then helped make my business dreams a reality.
